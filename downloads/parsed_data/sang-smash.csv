"event","Twenty minutes of Krista's DB Circuit B

2.5 multi-sets (i.e. 2 complete rounds of 10 reps, 1 round of 5 reps):
 10 x 25# DB snatch (each side)
 10 x 45# BB hang clean + push press
 10 push-up burpees

3 x 10# <a href=http://www.stumptuous.com/cms/displayarticle.php?aid=132#turkishgetup>Turkish get-ups</a> (each side)
Ab-work (30 sit-ups and 15 scissor-things)

Lessee, that's a... 25 percent improvement in work performed since last time (the first time) I did this workout. Not counting the Turkish get-ups and abwork.

25# is indeed just a touch too light. But given how hard I'm working the rest of the circuit, especially on the burpees, I'm not strongly moved to do anything about it quite yet.

Turkish get-ups feel as uncoordinated and klutzy as all get out. There are moments that ten pounds feels a bit too heavy -- just the slightest bit dicey, or stabilizer muscles pulling/stretching uncomfortably -- and others where it's obviously too light. (Too light = letting it drift out of vertical alignment, because it's not so heavy that I can't just pull it back into place.) I'll have to work on them some more, definitely. And I have no idea what an appropriate weight would be if I was fresh.

<lj-cut text=""Happy thoughts on the new schedule."">So far, not sticking to my new schedule too much. But! There is flexibility! And options! And so working out is happening!

See, when all my strength workouts were some sort of split, the weekly workout schedule was unforgivingly rigid. Missing a day meant that things got <I>messed up</i>, and I'd often deliberately miss another workout just so that the rest of the week's workouts fit into my week right. Which is, ahem, not ideal.

But having <i>some</i> strength workouts be full-body circuit affairs, and having <i>others</i> be serious-strength splits with the free weights means that if I miss a workout I can ""stutter-step"" (like you do in marching band, when you find yourself on the wrong foot) to get back in sync with the schedule. I like this.

Also, Krista's circuit workouts are <i>non-boring.</i> Which always helps."

Girlfriend squats are a little too heavy, but fun to play with. Not getting full range of motion -- partly because I don't trust myself to be able to lift her weight back up, but also because her shoulder keeps ending up where my thigh needs to be. :-(

For lunges, calf raises, and bench press, 45 pounds is a little too light. I could go up. 45 pounds is <i>not</i> too light for push presses, but I can probably push press more weight, if I wanted to be able to do the whole workout at a single barbell setting.

I've been trying to figure out a new workout schedule for myself -- I don't want to lose my backpacking muscle mass ('twas hard-earned!), but I don't have backpacking kind of time to devote to keeping it.

I'm thinking of my old T-W-Th, Sa-Su workout schedule, and having Krista-A and Krista-B bookend the mid-week workouts (Tue and Thur), and then do a traditional two-day split on Sat and Sun. (Wed. would be something non-strength.) That five-day schedule used to work pretty well for me back in the day, and given that I'm not repeating any workout in a week, I'm not having pre-emptive boredom (i.e., I write it down and immediately feel too bored to even finish the first week), and hopefully it'll be a while before actual boredom sets in."

<lj-cut text=""APFT training chatter"">I've been working on APFT training again -- right now, it's mostly in the form of doing intervals of push-ups and sit-ups after my main Crossfit workout on days 1 and 3 of the four day cycle. In the past, my push-up scores were limited more by how long I can hold plank than how many push-ups I can do; my sit-up scores were limited by how fast I could do sit-ups. The nice thing about doing interval work as opposed to sheer number of reps, is that it gives me a way to work on both things -- holding plank until the interval is over, and trying to squeeze as many sit-ups into the interval as possible.

I don't know for sure, but I've assumed that my weight is a limiting factor on my run score. (Okay, I just some fast research -- I'm seeing estimates of 2 secs per lb to 6 secs per lb.) But that doesn't change the fact that I DO need to put in time getting cardio-fit. I've been saying that I don't want to commit to running regularly until my weight comes down some more, but I enjoyed this morning, so... I dunno. Maybe I'll start throwing in a run now and then. We'll see.

BTW, the APFT minimum pass on the run is 10:51/mile. I've got to shave a minute and a bit off my run time, AND extend my run distance to two miles. Obviously, I've got a bit to go yet."

<li>Puppies workouts are maybe kinda sometimes starting to feel too easy. I'm usually using a weight than what is prescribed for pack females, if nothing else. I don't think I'm ready to scooch up to pack workouts just yet, but it's starting to look like someday-feasible and not forever-pipe-dream.
<li>The biggest thing keeping me off the pack-level workouts are my pull-ups. And since CF does kipping pullups, and not military pullups, a pullup probably isn't as far off as I think it is. Must make a practice of playing on the monkey bars in the park.</ul>"

"event","<b>Friday the 13th: Yoga</b>

Crossfit rest day, officially, but I essentially took my rest day yesterday. Wanted <i>some</i> activity today, even if not too hard-core, given that we're talking about a hike tomorrow and who-knows-what-unpleasantness from Crossfit. So.

5 x Sun Salute A
5 x Sun Salute B
Most of the Sivananda 12 poses

A couple thoughts:<ul><li>I definitely have gotten stronger over these past months -- there are a LOT of plank push-ups in those 10 Sun Salutes (esp. B), and my form only started to fail on the last couple.

<li>This annoying tightness I've been feeling isn't as comprehensive as I feared. I need a decent warm-up to hit Downward Dog, but I can still hit it properly, even if I'm not settling in as deep as I used to. I'm pleased -- it's a lot easier to deepen a pose than to hit it.

<li>The tightness is weird, non-uniform, and obviously bad for me. I'll be in a symmetric pose and feel a distinct pull through one muscle only on one side only.

<li>I've been underestimating how much my spine dislikes sitting and studying. Especially in the absence of yoga. Tsk. No wonder I've been feeling vertebra click and shift in ways that they should not.

<li>Sun salutes are probably a better warm-up for lifting than the crossfit warmup I've been doing.

<li>Just as I was thinking that I need to be racewalking as its own thing, once or twice a week, I need to be working yoga in, too.</ul>"

"event","Wow. Those cleans and dips on Tuesday REALLY worked all the stabilizing muscles in my shoulder girdle. Moving a textbook one-handed (say from my lap to the couch beside me) was making my shoulder feel like it was going to come apart. 

And no, the muscles aren't <i>injured</i>, they're just really, really sore. So I've been mostly laying off upper-body stuff, but still giving them some activity via bouldering and carrying a book pack.


<b>Wednesday: Bouldering, and 1 mile racewalk.</b> Was supposed to be a 5K, but my ankles/calves/shins weren't up to it. Been thinking off and on about adding in a regular racewalk for just this reason, but not ready to make a commitment to that yet.


<b>Thursday: More bouldering.</b>

Was supposed to be a <a href=http://sang-smash.livejournal.com/tag/total>Crossfit Total</a> day, but didn't want to mess around with 1-rep maxes when my stabilizers were still <i>that</i> sore.

7.5-ish miles on the Clackamas River Trail. Not too much elevation change all told, yet it kicked our asses. I was dragging, dragging, dragging the last couple of miles. And yes, I can blame at least some of that on Friday's workout, but not all.

<a href=""http://www.crossfit.com/journal/#1544"">Crossfit Total</a>: combined totals of 1 rep maxs of back squat, press, and deadlift.

Me, I don't have a rack, which means I'm not going to screw around with trying to max out my back squat. So I a substituted a clean + front-squat combo. Same with the press -- I ain't got no rack, so I need to be able to clean the weight first.

It turns out that I can squat more than I can clean. (Probably. It's not like I've got a means to test that theory.) I told <lj user=""grrlpup""> that, and she asked what not being able to clean a given weight meant. I gave her a pantomime -- explosively deadlifting a bar, followed by the surprised look when the bar settled in at hip height -- and she laughed. And laughed and laughed and laughed.

Clean + Front Squat
65 = 50 + bar = easy
<i>80 = 65 + bar = uncleanable</i>
75 = 60 + bar = 1 rep max

The walking lunges were okay -- 35ft, empty overhead bar, 4 rounds -- but the 15 burpees I was supposed to mix in? Disaster. My push-ups are still weak, and my form went completely to pieces with the jumping back into plank, and, and, and... I did, like, <i>two</i>, and decided THAT was enough of trying to do them for time, and I should break them out and do them separately. So I did all four rounds of walking lunges, took a break, and tried to do fifteen burpees. Made it to, like, <i>eight.</i> Said I'd do more later. Didn't.

Easy walk today: seven miles to the top of Tabor and back with <lj user=evannichols>. And it did feel easy. I could even talk going up the hill the steep way. I guess I really am getting in shape again.

Today's Crossfit workout was split jerks. New to me, and I worried a bit about doing them after a seven-miler. Not a lot of reason to be concerned, as it turned out, since I was mostly working with light weights, trying to get the form down.

Rx'ed: Split Jerk 3-2-2-2-1-1-1-1-1.
Puppies: Split Jerk, 5-5-5-5-5, with light to moderate weight.

I started with an empty bar (17#s, the scale says), and started working up in five pound increments per set. By the last set, I was getting on toward a weight that required correct form, and revealed/punished incorrect form. On the very first split on that set, the rear leg landed with a little twist, and I felt the torque in my knee. As with the squats last week, applying more concentration (and knowing what I was looking for) made the rest of the set feel solid and comfortable. Future sets should start with this weight and work from there.

And yeah, that final 37 pounds that was making my form feel weak? I can press it easily. :-/

Took an ice bandana with me, which got me through in relative comfort. Anything more than twenty minutes would have been a problem, though. (As it was, the ice in my water bottle melted at ten minutes.)

I'm reworking the beginner's running schedule by feel, increasing intensity and overall duration by what feels like an appropriate amount of stress. It's putting me two or three weeks behind the schedule-as-published, but I'm starting to suspect that beginners' schedules are all lies. Too aggressive, and too much reliance on the simplifying assumption that beginners are at a certain level. The only beginners schedules I've seen that haven't lied are Strong Women Stay Young and stumptuous.com. They're both pretty realistic about what starting from nothing feels like.

Stumptuous is SO realistic about it, in fact, that the first training week is a throw-away in terms of fitness gains. You're supposed to spend it figuring out how to get to the gym regularly. ;-)

"event","Argh. Back-spasm. Mid-back, largely triggered by sitting all day, but enabled by the lat pull-downs last night. This happened Friday evening at the ball game, too, a couple hours after that other set of lat-pulls.

<lj-cut text=""This isn't an injury-spasm."">This isn't an injury-spasm. It's more a muscle saying I'm-exhausted, this-is-too-much.

I think what's going on is that my back-in-general is fairly weak just now, such that my lats are doing a lot more of the ordinary, hour-to-hour postural work than they're strictly supposed to. So when I exhaust my lats with a semi-isolationist exercise, like lat-pulls, there's almost nothing left in my lats afterwards to help me sit upright, and no other muscle sets available to shift the load to. So my lats hit their limit and muscular temper tantrums occur.

Less sitting would help. Less asymmetric-sitting would help. Losing a little more weight so I can sit with proper pelvis posture would also help. But those are more about managing the root problem than about fixing it.

My suspicion is that the fix isn't in laying off the lat-work, either. (Maybe stepping it down for a few weeks, but not laying off of it.) I need to increase my dose of posture-centric back work, with the goal of eventually be strong enough that I can exhaust my lats without fear of daily-life consequences.

So?

Cobra-locust-superman type things. Reverse planks. Asymmetric reverse planks.

Sun salutes. Burpees.

Or <a href=http://www.stumptuous.com/cms/displayarticle.php?aid=82>dumbbell swings</a>, side presses, <a href=http://www.stumptuous.com/cms/displayarticle.php?aid=132>kettlebell</a>-type exercises, or similar weighted work. Whole-body, multi-angle stuff.

I'll experiment, and probably substitute such a mix for one of my gym-sessions each week.</lj-cut>

In the meanwhile, impromptu rest day today.

Other notes: the quad-extensions did not produce muscle-shredding pain last night. They weren't exactly easy, either, so I'm content to stay at this weight for a while.

Also: After getting home from the gym, I slung <lj user=grrlpup> around my hips and goofed around with some shallow squats. Shallow because I was wearing jeans, but also because I wouldn't want to go deep with her just now anyway. I need a little more experience first.

But it was fun. She giggled madly the whole time, and frankly, it's a lot more <I>interesting</i> than iron. I might revise my goal from deep squatting my own bodyweight to deep-squatting <i>her.</i> ;-)"

And, oh yes, once again I'm progressing much, MUCH slower than the published running schedules say that I ought to be able to. Is my physiology weird? Do I adapt slowly in endurance matters? Or do these beginners schedules push the rate of increases, trying to make it look like it won't be a long, slow haul?</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Friday gym"">Friday afternoon, after work, I finally got myself over the hurdle and into the company gym. I love Fridays in the gym. Mostly because it's pretty quiet, but also because all the other folks there are <i>into</i> it. Slackers, dieters, dilettantes, aerobicizers -- they don't show up on Friday. Just a handful of guys who are really <i>really</i> into their muscles. The proverbial <a href=http://www.stumptuous.com/cms/displayarticle.php?aid=25>""non-drug-using male trainees who would happily crawl of their lips through a field of leeches to add fifteen crummy pounds of muscle a year.""</a>

I'd much, much, rather work out with them, and their focus, and their minding-their-own-business, than with the usual horde.

So, yeah, I was pretty dilettanteish myself -- one set all around -- but I am <i>sore</i> this morning, especially through ankles and back, so I did good.

Oh, and I still hate  quad extensions. By rep three, my quads felt like they were shredding themselves -- longitudinally shearing apart inside -- even though the weight was set such that I could do twelve reps. Which I did. And my quads never stopped feeling like they were shearing apart inside. Argh.

And yet, this morning, no quad sorness. None. Nada. I can punch my quads without flinching, that's how not-sore they are. So go figure. (And do you wonder why I hate quad extensions??)</lj-cut>

While I was there last night, I decided on two strength goals, both selected with much inspiration-input from stumptuous.com:<ol><li>Full squat my own bodyweight.
<li>Lat pulldown my own bodyweight.</ol>
I'm not going to get to a pull-up this year, obviously, but it's still something I really want to be able to do someday. And stumptuous' <a href=http://www.stumptuous.com/cms/displayarticle.php?aid=51>Mistressing the Pull-up</a> is much, much improved over the first-pullup advice she used to give, back when. (Same outline, but much more detail, far more options, more intermediate steps. Yay.)

And, of course, passing the APFT. But the stumbling block to that always has been running, not the strength-work, so the APFT does not motivate me much in the gym. But squatting my own bodyweight? That's just frickin' <i>cool.</i>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Everything, especially the knees, are feeling a bit wonky this morning."">Everything, especially the knees, are feeling a bit wonky this morning. I have been again-again-again trying to get back onto the exercise-as-a-habit bandwagon.

You know how that is. You make a running jump at it, you don't get quite good enough of a hold, cling and scrabble a bit, then get jostled off shortly after. So, you pick yourself up, dust yourself off, swear a bit, wonder why you're bothering with this crap, then finally run and jump again, with the hopes that one of these times you'll either luck into a good grip, or you'll figure out the knack of running and jumping.

Anyway, yeah, leaving the metaphor behind, one of the trickiest bits is getting to the point where suiting up for a workout seems worthwhile. If I spend as long or longer changing into my workout gear than I spend working out... Well, it's a bit of a mental challenge.

It's even more of a mental challenge when I wake up the next morning and discover that perhaps I was pushing too hard the night before. And that maybe I need another rest day or two.

Which makes it even harder to get myself into the mental rut of ""I work out every day"". (No, not every-every day. But aiming for the default question of ""What shall my workout be today? Unless I've gotten to where I need a rest day?"" instead of asking, ""Agh, have I gotten in enough workouts this week? Do I need to work out today?"")

I'm not bitching, of course. Just noting.

And feeling a bit self-conscious, because, drat it, this is the whichteenth run and jump at the bandwagon this spring?

(...sigh...)

So. Quad extensions must become part of the strength routine, even though I hate them. Strength routine needs to continue, because it's the fastest way out of this not-fit-enough-to-work-out stage. I'm going to have to go <i>even more</i> gradually with adding in running than I have been. (Bleaugh.) And this is yet another vote for shaving off dead weight.</lj-cut>

<lj user=grrlpup> has been prodding me to find a goal project, some prize out there that makes the effort of training easier.

I already have one project, kinda: backpacking with <lj user=pagefever> before the summer is out. I'd like not to be humiliated on that trip because I'm too heavy/unfit to keep up. I'd also like to <i>enjoy</i> the backpacking part. (Hence regular hiking. Hence weight-training.)

Oh, also (so I guess it's two projects): show <lj user=evannichols> Tunnel Falls before the summer is out.

As far as planning any other project goes, though, it feels too early. I'm at that stage where it's hard to tell how quickly I'm going to progress, which means it's really difficult to pick a reasonable-yet-enticing goal. 

Speaking of enticing goals: <lj user=crazy_marcia> was telling me the runs she's pining to do over the next year-or-so. And, like, wow. They're eat-your-life sort of goals, the sort of thing that I don't ever see myself wanting to train for, but still. Wow."

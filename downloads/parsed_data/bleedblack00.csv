Either take me as I am or leave me as I am. Because I am who I am, and I thought that's who you fell in love with in the beginning."

"event","If I could stab myself in the gut and wrench out every last hateful emotion I would.

But if I died, you would cry. It would hurt you more than it hurt me.

And this is the reason I still live today."

"event","Sometimes I hate myself.
And I wonder why you don't hate me, too.
I'm a horrible person with no real moral values, and I'll just end up using you like I use myself.

And sometimes I just want to die.
I want to die so bad that I can feel the knife twisting in my heart at your cruel words.

I barely trust myself, and if you don't trust me, then there is nothing left to trust.

And when the day is done, I still hate myself."

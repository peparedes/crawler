"event","&nbsp;Hi guys,&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm jumping ship and taking all of my spiritual/magick posts over to the Rending The Veil blog site.&nbsp;They are a great e-zine that posts issues on the&nbsp; sabbats also, so check out the&nbsp;zine itself. You won't be disappointed :)&nbsp;Don't delete me from here though because I'll still probably look here to read the communities I've joined as well as to catch up on you guys if you don't make the switch.<br /><br />You should totally join if you're not already a member. It's free and it's awesome. The webmasters are helpful and very personable. The blog feature goes live on wednesday. It's currently in beta testing right now.<br /><br /><a href=""http://elgg.rendingtheveil.com/magazine/"">http://elgg.rendingtheveil.com/magazine/</a><br /><br />My screen name on there is viracerhaes.

"event","I have been feeling a little loopy lately and <lj user=""mint_heaven""> (aka <lj user=""aydira"">) and I have been talking about grounding a lot. I looked up a couple grounding techniques and found one that I liked.

I tried it tonight when I got home after my sister's wreck, which had all of us kinda spaced out, and it was very refreshing.

I imagined forming an energy cord and anchoring it to my body, then I imagined it going through all the layers of the earth (that I know about anyway lol) and wrapping around the firey core and formed an anchor screw thing to that. Then I brought light down from the universe through my crown, wrapping around every chakra and sending it out through my root chakra down my cord. I did this a few times, strenghtening the cord and making it bright and thicker each time. When I opened my eyes it was like I had just gotten a new pair of glasses or something because everything was clear and crisp. The first thought I had was, ""I feel like I'm <b>here</b>."" It was envigorating."

"event","After watching The Number 23 with my husband tonight, I got to thinking about the ever present number in my life, 333.

Here we go with some math (even though I hate it). My birthday is August 9th, 1986 on a Friday.

August = 6 letters
August = 8th month.

8+6 = 14
4-1 = <b>3</b>

----------------
9th day = <b>3+3+3</b>

----------------
1986= 

19  + 8 + 6 = <b>33</b>

----------------
Friday, if you coordinate the letters with their numerical order in the alphabet is  =  6-18-9-4-1-25.
Add those up, you get 63. Divide that by <b>3</b>, you get 21. Add 2 + 1 you get <b>3</b>


Pretty, weird huh? 

Jonathan said if you go out searching for the number, you will find it because you are looking for it and attatching meaning to it. I think, however that it is synchronicity. But perhaps I am looking too hard into it."

"event","""There is no such thing as an objective truth outside of our perception; therefore, all things are true and possible.""<br /><br />Whilst doing research on Chaos Magick, a form which I am currently learning about, I came across the previous&nbsp;quote which is an analysis that explains, ""<font size=""2"">Nothing is True and Everything is Permitted."" I thought about it and I agree with it. It was cited in the section describing Magickal Paradigm Shifting (something I didn't understand before but now do, go me!). I realized that in a way, I do this a lot, the paradigm shift.&nbsp;<br /><br />The entry also stated that chaos practitioners </font>use the concept of the gnostic state (introduced by Peter J. Carroll) in which the chaos magician focuses on only one goal/thought and other thought forms attempting to enter are pushed to the subconscious so they can be dealt with in ways unknown and without the focus of energy from the conscious mind. At least that's how I interpreted it. (If it's wrong or misinterpreted, please correct me.) In Carroll's magickal theory, he stated that acheiving the state of gnosis is ""<font size=""2"">what is necessary for working most forms of magic.""&nbsp;<br /><br />This is something else that I found myself agreeing with. I believe that if you can reach a state of gnosis in which your determination is focused solely on what you are trying to do, then interferring thoughts, perhaps of negativity or beliefs of impossibility, will and should be pushed into the subconscious and dealt with there so that the energy of your conscious mind can aid in achieving your objective. At least... that's how I interpreted this. This is the first time I've done any research on Chaos magick or the theory there of, but this is what I've collected from it.</font>"

"event","<p>I have a few frustrations with myself (mostly due to low self esteem and the fact that I am easily intimidated) that I think I need to deal with or would like to get opinons dealing with.<br /><br />I have been studying paganism and&nbsp;the occult&nbsp;on and off for about 3 years now, since I was about 18. When I was 15/16 I did a little bit of research on Wicca but decided that at that point in my life it was not the path for me. I don't consider myself to be anything really, I just slap the label of pagan on the can of soup that is my life. It feels right for me.&nbsp;That being said, I have a few friends that know so much about these esoteric topics and at times I feel overwhelmed and beneath them. I feel like an ignoramous trying to talk to them about things pertaining to my spirituality because even though I've been doing tons of research, I still consider myself to be a beginner. I've done a couple spells, some cleansing rituals, but nothing too extravagent. I feel out of place because their paths are way above me and I feel as if maybe my intelligence level is not where it should be to comprehend them. I have a tremendous amount of respect for them but I guess I wish I could ""fit in"" a little better because as of right now I feel like I don't even deserve to be their friends. It's like I'm this little pagan peon. Of course, they are very patient, very helpful and very understanding with me. They have done nothing to make me feel this way. I guess perhaps I am being impatient because I know they have been practitioners of magick of all sorts for a number of years and I cannot&nbsp; just snap my fingers and become a high magickian over night. I know that it doesn't work that way. I know that I have much more learning to do. What could I do to soothe my impatience and annoyance with myself? There are a lot of begginer books that I find questionable because I do not want to be considered a fluffy pagan. I am serious about my path and intend to follow it, excuse this pun, ""religiously"" for the rest of my life. I cherish my friends and bless them for dealing with me and my ignorance. I thank them for the volumes of wisdom that they have bestowed upon me and I appologize whole heartedly for not grasping all concepts fully.&nbsp;<br /><br />I guess I just want to be the best that I can be and I know that it's going to take a lot of work and determination. I just have this fear of being an annoyance. But I guess I could just enjoy and appreciate the fact that I have such fantastic peers that are willing to help me out in this time of baby steps.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>The night before last I had an odd dream.&nbsp;<br /><br />I dreamt that I was on my old college campus and there was a man that was raping people to collect energy. I simulated having sex with someone to draw out this man and I guess capture him or stop him or something. His last victim had been a young girl that looked like me when I was younger, only a little different. The thing about her though, was that she <em>wanted</em> to have sex with this thing, not knowing what it could possibly do. I used her as ""bait"" to get him to come to the parking lot where he was supposed to find the scene of simulated fornication. When he showed up, I jumped out of the car I was in and started running. As I was running, I felt him jumping from person to person, possessing them, trying to get closer to me. When he was right behind me in the body of this guy, I turned around and said, ""I know what you are EGREGORE!"" Only... he wasn't an egregore. He was more like an incubus. Then I woke up.<br /><br />If you don't know what an egregore is (as Wikipedia states): ""an <a title=""Occult"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"">occult</a> concept representing a ""<a title=""Thought form"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_form"">thought form</a>"" or ""<a title=""Collective"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective"">collective</a> group mind"", an autonomous <a title=""Psychic"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic"">psychic</a> entity made up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people.""<br /><br />I don't know why I called this entity an egregore, as he was in fact, not an egregore. As I stated before, he was more like an incubus. Thankfully, he did not have the chance to attatch to me. It could have just been a dream. If he shows up again, I'm going do the LBRP and try and get rid of whatever it is.<br /><br />It could just be words that have been burned into my subconcious because I have been thinking about egregores a lot and just the other day someone mentioned an incubus in a community I'm in. Hopefully that's all it is.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /></p>"

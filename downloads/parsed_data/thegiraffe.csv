Alluring
An angel come to earth
With a laugh that lifts your spirits
Brings sunshine through the fog
Anticipating your touch
Counting the seconds until I can kiss you
I fall asleep with thoughts of you
Your face inside my dreams
It was your voice on the wind
That woke me from sleep
With a smile brighter than the sun"

"event","The only thing that meant anything to me was taken away before I even had a fighting chance to try and save what we had.  I never told her how I felt.  Well that's not entirely true, I told her but the magnitude of my feelings was never properly expressed.  Saying I Love You has nothing to do with meaning it nor does it have anything to do with explaining your love.  Three words doesn't come close to letting her know that you want to spend the rest of your life with her.  I Love You doesn't cover enough ground.  You were my world and without you it feels like I don't exist.  Even after all this time, getting over you is not any easier than it was the day after, if not worse.  I never really understood what people meant when they say that they feel like they lost something.  I know that I've said those words before because if was as if they needed to be said; that's not the case.  Now I know.  Feeling incomplete is possible.  We all start our lives as one person, as one half of love and we spend the rest of our lives searching for our other half. The key is not letting go once you've found it.  Fighting for it.  Dieing for it.  I guess I'm not a fighter.  Or I'm just afraid since I've lost you twice, trying to make you realize you'll never have to be half again could make it hurt even more.  If you said no, it would be as though I've lost you a third time.  Instead I battle everyday just to sirvive without you.  I should have told you what you meant to me.  I was scared of losing you, now I""m terrified to try to win you back.  I know deep down that it will never happen again for me, at least not with you."

"event","Don't judge me when all you have to compare my to is your own life.  When you know nothing else, it's not your decision to make or your business to get involved in anything.  Understand and correct the errors in your own life before trying to talk to others about theirs.  Maybe your just scared.  Maybe your life scares you so much you have to live your happiness vicariously through other people.  Sad.  What happens when you go home at night.  When all you have to dream about are the things that other people have done.  Do you sit alone and cry for everybody else.  I did not ask for your input.  Why do you feel the need to give it.  Nobody is perfect,. and we all need to fix, or accept and adjust to our own lives before we help people with theirs.  Our lives all intertwine, we don't deny this.  However, unless our own direct actions will help somebody else's life, it should be up to them to resolve whatever issues their going through.  Asking for somebody's help with emotional issues, is in all reality pointless.  All they do is let you sit there and go over possible causes of action and then decide on your own which one would be best for you.  At most they give you an angle that you just didn't see before.  Ultimatey, one will chose their own path whether or not they think they got help from outside sources.  Asking for somebody's advice and then taking it is simply justifying a direction that you were to cowardly to chose on your own.  It makes you feel better about your choice when you think that somebody else gave it to you, or you think it makes somebody else feel important by letting them think that they actually helped you come to a decision that will affect you rlife.  NOT THEIR PLACE TO DO SO.  Everybody has the means and the drive to change their own life.  All it takes is to sit down for half an hour and think about everything that's making you uncertain.  Maybe you'll end up burning a bridge or two, but others will be built along the way.  Don't think about what others think, or about hurting somebody else's feelings, they will get over that.  But if it's going to make you happy, then it doesn't matter what others think.  Your friends will be ther for you, and if they aren't or don't support you in whatever you chose to do, then you need to think about how good of a friend they are in the first place.  If they try to interject with what they think you should do, then maybe they just want you to do what's best and are simply offering suggestions.  Listen to them, but only listen, and then come to your own conclusions.  They will stand beside you. I have made my own decisions throughout my life, and I've also done what others think.  The one's I don't regret, are the ones I've made on my own.  So don't judge me when all you have to compare my lfie to is your own.  Worry about your's first and then you still won't have the right to judge anybody else."

"event","Well my car left me stranded in Hamilton on Sunday, if you didn't know that already.  It cost me $100 to get a tow to Petro from C.A.A which could have been a lot worse but it still sucks.  What sucks even more, is the fact that my dad has the platinum card with C.A.A which gives him up to 200km for free towing, and he was in Hamilton on sunday, and I couldn't get a hold of him. (at the time I didn't know that he had that card, or I would have waited until he got home and had him come to get me, but that's neither here nor there)  So I thought that it was the fuel pump that was broken, since when I looked under the hood there was no fuel being sprayed out of the injector.  It ended up only being a broken crank sensor, which ended up being a lot cheaper to fix that what I orignally thought.  So now my car works again, and it's up to the car on how long it wants to work for now.

But, tomorrow, myself Alex and Kyle (a guy from my class) are going to the Toronto Rock lacross game, so that should be fun.  I just hope that Alex and I can stand being around the guy for that long.  He isn't a bad guy, but he can get very annoying very quickly (and I can't get angry with him, because it's his A.D.D that does it)  But it should be okay.  I'm really excited to see them play, since i've never been to a Rock game before.  

I have so much more to post, (or tell people) but I'm at school right now, and have to head back to class."

"event","Hey everyone.

I've decided it's time to move on.  Good ol' Livejournal has been a babe but sometimes you've got to go back and clean out the ol' closet.  Too many silly meaningless posts and not enough readable material. (Vote for boobs??!!...)

My new Livejournal account is located here: <lj user=""meridiancrest"">.

If you would like to continue reading my journal you should add me to your friends list!
I'm going to add the journals I actually read to mine as soon as possible.

If anyone would like to take over my Photoshop community shoot me a comment on <lj user=""meridiancrest""> and it will be considered.  

Good night!"

"event","I was notorious for taking <a href=""http://www.ultimatefatburner.com/vpx-redline-feedback.html"">VPX's Redline</a> RTD (ready to drink) formula around this time last year to keep me up while I was working two full time positions at Circuit City.  Redline is a metabolism booster/fat burner that works by first breaking your body out in a sweat, then chilling it to the point that it has a slight but noticeable shiver.  I lost around one pound per day drinking the RTD formula, and maintained a good energy level throughout the holiday season at Circuit City, nevermind the 70+ hour weeks.  Needless to say, the guys at Circuit City were hooked on the stuff, and we probably kept Smoothie King/The Vitamin Shoppe sold out for a month straight.

I think at that time it contained Ephedrine, but since the ban the drinks have been shitty and I had almost lost all hope until I took a dose of the gel capsules today before work.

I popped 2 of the capsules after a healthy lunch today, and went on about my business.  Thirty minutes later I hadn't noticed any more energy than I had previously and almost threw the rest of the bottle in the trash can.  Well, after I clocked in I took four more -- for a total of six capsules.  This is the maximum daily recommended dosage.

I started to feel the sweat I had remembered, my face got a little flush and my head started sweating just a little bit.  Well, apparently the capsules take over an hour to kick in, and by the time I had read this online I had already consumed six capsules. I suddenly felt a rush of energy like I had never felt before and my body started chilling.  I knew I was in for a day.  Brian calls this stuff worse than coke.  I'd say it is probably close to certain Amphetamines but I'm not a drug user myself so I wouldn't know what to compare it with besides Adderall.  It does enhance your cocentration and focus.

This time the sweat wasn't bad at all, the chills weren't even noticeable and I've been hungry since about 5pm. I'm finally feeling relaxed enough to possibly lie down for the night. 

That will be the last time I ever take six capsules of Redline at once."

"event","So, I feel like I've wasted the last 24 hours of my life.  And, I also remember why I hated working at Circuit City 63% of the time.

Earlier this week during a Windows update, my computer randomly turned off.  This created problems with corrupted files, drive integrity, etc.  It continued to turn itself off whenever it felt it needed to for the next couple of days, and my computer would have such a hard time pulling anything from the hard drive that it would come to a crawl trying to complete even the simplest of tasks.

So, I tried a couple of different things, attempted to reformat the drive, etc. BUT, it kept shutting off during the process.  I checked my CPU temp. and it was at 73c.  That's pretty high for an AMD 2200+.

After trying to swap out almost every last component (memory, video card, PSU, CPU, hard drive, motherboard) -- I finally broke down and disassembled the entire computer last night.  Over the last 24 hours I took every last piece of equipment out of my computer, cleaned the heatsink and re-applied grease, reset every card and my CPU.  And re-built the entire computer.

In the process I added a 120gb Western Digital hard drive, an AMD Barton 3000+(overclocked to 3200+), a DVD/CD burner, and a couple of other things.  I finally got everything going today and my temp dropped almost 40 degrees celcius. Apparently it was just too dirty or the heatsink wasn't making proper contact with the CPU any longer... I don't know.  I was joking around with Brian last night telling him with my luck I'd probably fix the problem by 6am this morning -- little did I know..."

For a couple of months we had a promotion going to host artists for free so long as they had a domain name (an effort to boost our domains-hosted and help support the community that loved us -- not to mention the viral opportunity).  We made it clear that donations would be appreciated, and we got plenty.  Some of them had odd and sometimes explicit notes attached to the transaction.

What a surprise.

So, what do you think about Fox skipping (or as he says -- overdosing) on his medication before pushing the democratic vote in Missouri?  What do you think about Rush's reaction?  I wouldn't wish Mike's disease upon anyone, and I realize Parkinson's is a horrible disease. I do, however, agree with points Rush has made.  I think skipping your meds or whatever Mike did before airing the commercial is somewhat exploitative, BUT this is, after all, a political advert!  Anyway, if you'd like to see the commercial that's been in the news lately, here it is:

"event","Whenever I'm at my mom's house, I always learn new things.  

Today I learned about e-mail.  My mom seems to think her e-mail account was just deleted one day sometime last month.  She tried to sign in and it had been deleted.  Yahoo just decided one day that they would delete Mary's account for no reason but just to delete Mary's account.  I tried to explain to my mother that I'd never heard of this before, so she must've either been exchanging child pornography and warez or she probably just forgot her username.  The latter is more believable.

Today my aunt Stefanie called my mom and told her that her e-mail had been deleted and moved to Outlook Express.  She wasn't sure how this could've happened because she does not use Outlook.  She wasn't sure what happened and didn't know how to get her e-mail back.  My mom of course knew what was going on.  They probably just deleted her e-mail account!  Of course, of course.

She said she was going to call customer support.

"event","It's now May 15 (according to my e-mail).  It has been around a month since my initial contact from the company.  I'm finally boarding the plane to Atlanta for my trip to Dallas/Grapevine, Texas.  I don't remember many details about the actual trip itself.  I don't remember it being especially pleasant or remarkably bad.
<lj-cut>

I do, however, remember most of my time spent in Texas.  How could I forget?  I was sent with another from the Columbus area, Candi.  She is a lady in her early 40's who loves to shop, gossip, and shop.  What else?  During her interview, Ron apparently recorded an incorrect telephone number for her so I couldn't get in touch.  He also failed to get her seat to me so I had no idea where she was, who she looked like, or how I might find her.

When I arrived, I realized they had booked our rental vehicle in my name instead of Candi's.  That's awesome -- if I were over 25 years of age.  You see, rental companies have this policy about not renting to those of the younger crowd for some reason.  So, here I am stuck in the middle of the gargantuan airport that is Dallas/Ft. Worth with no vehicle, no idea who to get in contact with, etc...  You get the point.  Ron wouldn't pick up his phone so I got in touch with Darryl.  After us repeatedly getting the voice mailbox of some African-American woman, we decided we probably had the wrong number.

Darryl advised me to board the shuttle to get to my hotel room and forget about Candi, she would find her way there somehow.

Around dinner time that night I got a call from the front desk saying there was a woman there looking for me.  I walked down and there she was.  She gave me an awkward look (I'm sure she expected to see a handsome gentleman in his early-to-mid thirties), and we got dinner.  So this would be the beginning of two weeks of interesting stories, 9-hour training classes, dinners, mall-trips, and whatever else that I shared with Candi.  How special.

To sum up the two weeks in a couple of sentences, the hotel I was staying at offered happy hour after 4pm.  Free wine and beer.  I probably don't have to say much else, really.  Most of the people from training stayed at that hotel.  I got along with plenty of them, including a 40 year old guy named Brian.  Brian had an heir about him, his voice commanded authority; and I could tell he must've had some experience behind him.  Apparently he was responsible for branding Terry Bradshaw (Texas news personality) before joining the ranks of Yellowbook.

We went to the Rangers game, to the IMAX theater in Dallas, went downtown on the weekends, to the mall in Grapevine, and lots of other fun stuff.

I learned a lot about Candi during that 2 weeks since we had to go everywhere together.  A self-proclaimed Christian who goes to the most popular church in Columbus.  She was a compulsive shopper, was in debt thousands of dollars, frequently borrowed money from her parents, lived in the up-scale apartments in Columbus (Greystone) and drove a VW which costs her $600 a month.  She was socially and financially immature and I have never seen a woman like her in all of my life.  She constantly complained (to everyone) about how in-debt she was but would drag me to the mall all day on the weekend and spend hundreds of dollars on make-up, clothing, genuine Texas cowboy hats, beer, fast food everyday, you name it.  Towards the end she had people buying her lunches and other things for her.  I quickly learned to avoid her like the plague when I could.

The best part of the trip was the night our sales trainer took us out to the Rangers game.  He had box seats so the view was impressive.  We all got very ridiculously drunk.  Brian and I both drank a 6 pack of beer each that we had accumulated at the hotel over the 2 weeks and a couple glasses of wine.  On the way to the game Candi had our driver stop at almost every gas station along the way and we split about 4 6 packs of some kind of bitch beer Candi liked.  After the four of us would split a 6 pack, there would be two bottles left.  One for Brian and one for myself.

All I can say is by the time we got to the park I wasn't sure of exactly where we were or how we got there or what we were doing.  I walked up to the food server and bought $20 worth of chicken fingers.  Apparently it was cute that the youngster was wasted... like they thought I couldn't handle my alcohol and they could?  I'm not sure.  By the end of the game Brian and Candi were making out, as they did the entire way home.  I was stuck sitting next to Becky who would pass out every once in a while and fall in my lap or on my shoulder.  I talked to the older woman who was driving us back the entire time hoping to get there before we actually could.  I'm sure she enjoyed taxiing around a bunch of drunks.  At least it wasn't the group I hang out with -- there may have been puking going on.

Candi and Brian retired to Candi's hotel room (respectively).  She claims they didn't have sex, but that Brian just took a shower and laid on the foot of her bed.  She was truly surprised at how sweet he really was down inside.  I guess God wanted them to spend the night together just to talk things over and read a book or two together...

I had the rest of a 6-pack of Smirnoff and nowhere to go, so I stopped by the hot tub (which was conveniently located just 4 feet from my door) where I found a young and budding couple to share them with.  They were on their way to their honeymoon and were just stopping in for the night.  We drank a couple of beers and I dropped my phone in the water.

Will continue in Part III..."

"event","I happened to knock off whatever work I was doing around 1:30 and finally closed my eyes around 2.

I drifted off into a magical world for a little while and was suddenly awakened by a fire-breathing dragon attempting an escape from out of the depths of my stomach.  He wasn't no little weakling, either.

Never before in my life have I had such an experience with what I presume to be acid reflux.  I started having a horrible dream and was woken up with a throat and mouth full of stomach acid and other gastric-juice goodness.  It was a horrible experience.  I was dazed, confused, and had no idea what was going on.  All I knew was that this shit had to have been the most unpleasant thing that has ever been in my mouth.

After running through my apartment naked a couple of times trying to figure out what was going on, I remembered my mom giving me soda and water and making me gargle it.  I looked through the cabinets hoping to find a box of baking soda but ultimately had to resort to the less-than-sanitary box at the bottom of the fridge.  At the time I didn't care and poured a couple of palm-fulls of the soda into a cup of hot water to create something that tasted almost worse than the acid.  I gagged a couple of times but fought it all the way down.  It felt good.

I finally put some shorts on and sped to Winn Dixie, stopping at every red light to spit some soda water.  I sped to the back and grabbed a plastic box full of Tums and started eating them like an animal.  I didn't stop when the cashier was checking me out, either. There was a guy in front of me who kept complaining about the smell of cigarette smoke.  No matter how many times the cashier told him there was no smoking in the store, he wouldn't stop.  He held his nose the entire time he was in line and kept saying how he wished cigarettes were banned in America.  Every once in a while he would turn back to me in hopes for some kind of support only to remember I was pouring a box of Tums down my throat. My stomach is just now starting to settle, but I think I'll pop a couple more for good measure.

(Sorry if this is grammatically horrible I'm really not awake...)"

"event","I've never been a proponent of (the purchase of) cheap printers (namely <a href=""http://www.lexmark.com"">Lexmark</a>).  But, this evening I realized I was either going to shell out almost $90.00 for 6 ink cartridges for my Epson photo printer or $30.00 for Lexmark's wonderful <a href=""http://www.lexmark.co.uk/uncomplicate/product/home/564/0,7044,252735_403948_715395636_en,00.html"">Z645</a> at the local Wal-Mart.  I opted for the latter as a huge storm was brewing and I figured the printer would be fine to print text documents and the occasional webpage or clipart graphic.

I read on the package the printer supported 4800dpi.  Wow!  That was still almost half the resolution of my Epson but how could I argue for $29.98.  10ppm black and 3ppm color is nothing to be proud of, but I figured I wasn't racing anyone anyway so why should it matter much for the occasional print job.

Well, I got the printer's ridiculous console installed (they don't offer just a driver, you've gotta install their little dashboard), searched through my closet to find a USB cable, and wired it up for power.  After 30 minutes of messing with the driver-installation software not picking a printer up on the USB comm port and installing (and re-installing) the software, I reluctantly removed my Epson printer from Window's Control Panel.  This solved the problem as apparently Lexmark doesn't play well with others -- but I can understand I guess.  Afterall, Lexmark is a far superior product...  why should it have to share the control panel with the underling that is Epson?

I finally got the printer to the point of printing out a test page (this is after over an hour of tinkering around, mind you) only to find out the ink that was in the box is dried out.

Now I remember why I never buy cheap shit."

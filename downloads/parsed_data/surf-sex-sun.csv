Like a shining star, you have no trouble being the center of attention
In fact, you often feel a bit hurt when all eyes aren't on you
You need to be number one in everything, no matter how trivial
And it's this ego that both hurts your confidence and helps you acheive

You're dramatic and a powerhouse of pure energy
You posess a divine quality or uniqueness that's hard to define
A natural performer, it's likely you'll become famous in some circles.
Just learn not to take everyone's reaction to you so personally!

Peyote puts us in balance again with the Earth underneath our feet... Peyote is a plant sacrament. It is a plant teacher. It is a way of life. Our time in these bodies is brief. When we eat the Peyote we experience time and eternity, and it is from that vantage that, the next day, we can live our life in a very positive and non- trivial way, realizing that this day could be the last and everyone around us is our brother and sister and we need each other."" ......"

You could say it's an accident that I was ideally suited for the work I am doing. It's the feeling of a bowstring being pulled back for 22 years and suddenly being let go. I am primarily an American, second, a Californian, third, a Los Angeles resident. I've always been attracted to ideas that were about revolt against authority. I like ideas about the breaking away or overthrowing of established order. I am interested in anything about revolt, disorder, chaos - especially activity that seems to have no meaning. It seems to me to be the road toward freedom - external revolt is a way to bring about internal freedom. Rather than starting inside, I start outside - reach the mental through the physical. I am a Sagittarian - if astrology has anything to do with it - the Centaur - the Archer - the Hunt - But the main thing is that we are The Doors. 

We are from the West. The whole thing is like an invitation to the West. 

The sunset - This is the end
The night - The sea 

The world we suggest is of a new wild west. A sensuous evil world. Strange and haunting, the path of the sun, you know? Toward the end. At least for our first album. We're all centered around the end of the zodiac. The Pacific - violence and peace - the way between young and the old."

"event","One of Hawking's major discoveries, made In 1973, was that quantum effects will cause black holes to emit particles. The black hole will evaporate in the process, so that ultimately perhaps nothing of the original mass will be left. But during their formation, black holes swallow a lot of data-the types, properties and configurations of the particles that fall in. Although quantum theory requires that such information must be conserved, what finally happens to it remains a topic of contentious debate. Hawking and Penrose both believe that when a black hole radiates, it loses the information it held. But Hawking insists that the loss is irretrievable, whereas Penrose argues that the loss is balanced by spontaneous measurements of quantum states that introduce information back into the system.
Both scientists agree that a future quantum theory of gravity is needed to describe nature. But they differ in their view of some aspects of this theory. Penrose thinks that even though the fundamental forces of particle physics are symmetric in time-unchanged if time is reversed-quantum gravity will violate time symmetry. The time asymmetry will then explain why in the beginning the universe was so uniform, as evinced by the microwave background radiation left over from the big bang, whereas the end of the universe must be messy.
Penrose attempts to encapsulate this time asymmetry in his Weyl curvature hypothesis. Space-time,as Albert Einstein discovered, is curved by the presence of matter. But space- time can also have some intrinsic bending, a quantity designated by the Weyl curvature. Gravitational waves and black holes, for example, allow space-time to curve even in regions that are empty. In the early universe the Weyl curvature was probably zero, but in a dying universe the large number of black holes, Penrose argues, will give rise to a high Weyl curvature. This property will distinguish the end of the universe from the beginning. Hawking agrees that the big bang and the final ""big crunch"" will be different, but he does not subscribe to a time asymmetry in the laws of nature. The underlying reason for the difference, he thinks, is the way in which the universes evolution is programmed. He postulates a kind of democracy, stating that no point in the universe can be special; therefore, the universe cannot have a boundary. This no-boundary proposal, Hawking claims, explains the uniformity in the microwave background radiation. The physicists diverge, ultimately, in their interpretation of quantum mechanics. Hawking believes that all a theory has to do is provide predictions that agree with data. Penrose thinks that simply comparing predictions with experiments is not enough to explain reality. He points out that quantum theory requires wave functions to be ""superposed,"" a concept that can lead to absurdities. The scientists thus pick up the threads of the famous debates between Einstein and Niels Bohr on the bizarre implications of quantum theory. -The Editors

Life is going to be fun i think i mean it already has been pretty fun i wish i could of had things happen other ways but u know im no gonna stresss on it to much i wish i wasnt soo lazy and i could just sit down and do homework or w/e it is...for some reason i have this sense of doin things ""half-ass"" as my mom would say it or not doing it at all...and i cant seem to stay outta that habit its one of my biggest downfalls and i hate it...and one of my other biggest downfalls is my sense of being Shy...i cant help it...or if im not shy im an idiot and not the real me most people dont know the otherside of me...theres a few...but not many... im not gonna say there names cause they no who they are...

well...i havent drank in like 4-5 months at least and i almost felt like it the other day but i couldnt find anything soo i didnt....;).....but yea i want a good life with someone by my side that will be there for me through the rough and easy times through the rain and the stormiest weather there with me all night there by me...cuddling w/e u wanna call it...that i believe is life....life is love...if u love someone u have a life...if u dont have love u dont have a life..."

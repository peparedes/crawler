"event","Peddler has been on somewhat of a hiatus because I have been very, very busy lately with school and my two (other) jobs. I have had time for a few projects going over the last couple of months which include:

*hand screened flyers for Mortar and Pestle / Dig Shovel Dig / RC PRO AM show at the Corndale house in early October. 

*neat screened shirts for Marissa and Riannon on their birthday's in November. 

*fabric appliqued shirts for myself featuring crazy, imaginative, abstract designs...very weird pieces, i love them! 

*Polariod transfers (from 35mm slides) printed onto various papers...to be made into more abstract photo cards / postcards for bittermittens. (which is temporarily unavailable, hopefully the site will be back on before Christmas time). 

*and as always, LOTS AND LOTS of new b&w and C   O   L   O   U   R photography!

I am going to get this stuff photographed and posted very soon. By the way...I NEED SOME FRIENDS on this thing, so send all your pals and buyers over here!

neat-o."

"event","i went to marissa's house tonight, it was so beautiful! she has some really neat goodies from Ikea in Minnesota. BUT theres one up near DC we discovered and we officially planned an unofficial trip there soon. If you like cheap, modern, colorful goodies then you should come with us. we are going to museum hop too, i hope.

"event","hello and welcome. today i am off to kinkos to make transparencies for screen-burning. i plan on spending the next few days burning screens out and then ordering american apparell t-shirts (damn, they are nice!). since the trip to redwood country got cancelled i have been able to drop the monies on printing supplies instead. i am excited that shirts and undies will be ready for sale soon. i am hoping to start selling the clothes on bittermittens.com (which has peddler cards right now). so things are well for now and i am thankful for having time to get things done that ive wanted to for a long time.

now im off to buy new grip tape for the bike and to go swimmin with Riannon. Rock show in chapel hill tonight, yay!"

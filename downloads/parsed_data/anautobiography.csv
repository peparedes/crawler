"event","The weather on my drive home today was perfect. It was humid but not hot. Driving with the windows down was magical. It's the kind of weather that reminds me specifically and incontrovertibly of Florida. The memories that days like today conjure up, make me love florida unconditionally.

The first thing that jumps into my mind is driving to Destin. I would take a half day and leave early. I would be arriving around this time, coming off of the interstate, driving through Niceville, then over the bridge to Destin. Windows down, the air cool.  Excitement in my heart of knowing I was inching closer by the second. The uncontrollable happiness of knowing she would be in my arms. Destin is the representation of that feeling in memory. The smells, the sights, the weather - when I think of those feelings, I think of Destin and Lindsey. I think of driving the back roads - of feeling like a local. I think about getting dressed up and going to dinner at Harbour Docks. I think of BBQ's and Mojitos on her back porch - compliments about my cooking and comments on how much we love each other. The sheen on our foreheads from being outside in the Florida humidity. The long waits at wal-mart, the long afternoons at the beach. Falling asleep on the couch together. Waking up hours before she did and laying there just staring at her - feeling her skin next to mine. I think of all of the little trivial things that make up life and I don't think I can recall happier memories. I didn't want for anything besides more time together. I didn't ever want to leave.

It's been four months and I don't feel any better. Everything is a memory and I miss her more by the day."

"event","Yesterday afternoon I returned from Amsterdam, Holland. It was a beautiful experience to say the least. Despite all of the tourism, prostitutes, drug use and distaste for americans, the city was beautiful. Everyone on bikes, very little air pollution, very little yelling, good food around every corner. I just enjoyed the quiet. The non-tourist oriented areas had so little sound pollution; it was amazing. Everyone was beautiful - I attribute this to the access to good clothes, biking or walking everywhere and healthier food. The super markets in Amsterdam only had a tiny corner devoted to frozen or processed foods. Everything else was, what appeared to be, healthy.

Design was everywhere, from food packaging to toys to houseboats. It was a refreshing change from the approach of american design. We happen to be there during a week-long design showcase. The city put together a list of design-minded stores, buildings, schools and homes from around he city. They were featured on a map and all had a little stand outside the door. We only made it to a handful of them but everyone of the stops was overly pleasant.

Another highlight of the trip was Rotterdam. Its a city in Holland just a 45 minute train ride from Amsterdam. From what I've been told and read the entire city (with the exception of only a handful of buildings) was leveled during WWII. The result from this was a boom in forward thinking architecture. There is even a Netherlands Architectural institute there which is surrounded by bau haus styled homes, and picasso sculptures. There were two modern designed buildings (the NAI, and Library) then a bunch of Bau Haus (homes, museums) and one of the only buildings left from WWII, a church. The contrast was amazing and a great illustration of things working together aesthetically.

I'm rambling now but I kept a journal while I was there. I'll post some of those entries along with photos from the trip if anyone is interested. 

With the very few exceptions, I can't say I'm happy to be home.
Jeremy"

"event","How is it that I can wake up feeling completely in love and go to bed feeling alone, empty, anxious and upset? Its this horrible paradox that I am faced with in alternating weeks.

In addition, there appears to have been a double standard put in place regarding trust. The same things that keep me up at night with anxiety apparently effect my partner. Despite having this mutual discomfort her actions never seem to change. I think its that aspect that feels most like a slap in the face. Its a problem that is present, shared, understood and then ignored. I hate it.

It also turns out she feels unhappy almost all of the time. I can't help but feel worthless/useless because of this.

"event","What do citizens of Orlando do at seven in the evening on a Wednesday? I have no clue. So I searched through the paper to find out what was happening in the Greater Orlando area.

There was a tiny listing mixed among the concerts and dance clubs for Wednesday November 16th. It read: 

<i><b>Members of the Central Florida Accordion Club Perform</b>
5 pm-9:15 pm; Elks Lodge No 1830, 477 Howell branch
Road, Winter Park; free, (407) 678-3181</i>

Upon a brief consultation with Brandie, my company at the time, a decision to attend was made.

On entering the building I thought we would be asked to leave immediately. 
""What are you looking for?,"" a voice asked us, aggressively, from around the corner.
I explained that we were here for the accordion performance and the gentleman ushered us in.

Walking into that room was cinematic. Heads of white and grey dotted the scene. A gentleman stomped and sang as he played, hands dancing around the strange box of sound. The lighting, the sound of conversation, eerie music, it was all perfect.

Later in the evening Old couples took to the dance floor. Their good looks had faded but they smiled and danced and held each other close. I could picture them 30 years younger, gliding across the floor. 

Closing my eyes I could have been in paris.

I don't have the literary skills to express how wonderful and surreal that hour window of my life was. I'll stop here for fear of ruining it further. Three cheers for spontaneity and strange situations that turn magical."

"event","Oh my, yesterday was full of memories. First, the hurricane. The days of last year's hurricanes were among the best in my life. So much love, so much fun, no distractions and rain, beautiful rain.

 While at work I ventured out into the storm for lunch. The rain hit my skin like ice. It was the exact same feeling I had the last time I was in Niagara. Wet, windy and cold, hurrying though the storm to reach shelter. I wearing the same jacket. 

Then there was the weather following the hurricane. Perfection. The sun was out, the air was cold, simply amazing. Memories of better times: cold hands that fit together perfectly and warm hearts eager for life.

Before renting out my van to some friends I cleaned it. It reminded me of preparing for tour, being happy and excited and having someone there to share my happiness. It reminded me of how good it was to be who I was and all of the things I had to look forward to in my life. 

I had to get my jeep repaired. Opening the door and stepping in, the smell was unmistakable. It filled my mind with memories from when I bought it on up until I drove it last. It's now falling apart but I love that car.

Those days, where such good memories originated, are gone. I hope to find them again one day. I want to have something worth reflecting upon, I want to have something worth looking forward to."

I grabbed it from my storage space. It was next to a gas can and my broken dreams, piled in the shape of instruments.
Is this my room? My apartment,? My life? I adjust to relieve my hip and then take a deep breath. My nights are filled with these, filled with deep breaths. Waking on the hour, sometimes the half hour, wrapped in warm gasoline. My hair is stuck to the board that leans against the wall. Glued by old spray adhesive. Poor ventilation has probably made me dumb. Maybe that's why I don't  know where I am, who I am. A handful of tylenol PM and its back to sleep for another hour. I awaken to a pain in my neck, its raining and the room is dim. I reach over and grab the copy of Less Than Zero from next to my ""bed."" I read a few chapters then roll over. I am staring at a miniature bed and night stand. Irony? I go to turn on the television, there isn't one. Check my e-mail; no internet. This room is a prison.

""Do you have the disk""
""YEs it is here on my IPOD""
""Whoa there, we can't print from Ipods, we dont have any computers that have a firewire port, well except for the MAC but it isnt hooked up to the big printer""
""Okay, well can I use the MAC and burn the file to a CD (that I have in my backpack)""
""Sorry, we have disabled all of the computers from burrniing discs, for no reason whatsoever""
""Okay, well do you have a server I can upload it to""
""Yes, but none of us know how to work it""
""What about an FTP?""
""Oh yeah, there is an FTP hold on a moment""
-worker proceeds to help other customers as I wait patiently-

15 minutes later

""Hello, did you find out about the FTP?""
""Oh, no I didnt, you are just going to have to burn it to disk at home""
""Thanks for nothing, I'll see you in an hour""

60 minutes later

""Hi, I would like to make a 13x19 print please""
""okay, do you have the disk""
""Yes its right here on CD, not to be confused with a format in which you can't use""
""Okay well do you want it on weather proof vinyl?""
""What? NO. I want it on paper""
""Alright, its $10 a square foot.""
""sounds great""
""When did you wantt this by?""

""sorry for our banners its usually 24 hour turnaround""

"event","I feel so tired. Its a lot like running toward something but you never get there, you just keep running and running. There has to be a cure, I need a cure to this. Some pill to keep me awake and productive, or a machine to extend the hours into manageable intervals.


Don't you ever worry, I will always have this love in me. When it needs somewhere to go, it will indefinitely go to you."

"event","There are two things that can bring memories flooding back to me. The first is a scent. The second is the weather.

Today was the first cold day to grace florida this fall. Walking outside made me delirious with thought. Even more so this evening, when i went to fetch my instrument. 

Running through the streets of downtown orlando, singing while scott played drums and we all inhaled chlorine, long drives to deland, being heartbroken, finding love, sleeping next to Anna, late night trips to denny's and moons over my hammy, coffee, leaning against sun warmed brick walls at BCC, my first semester at valencia, driving in circles until the sun came up, kissing, finding a hand that fits perfectly in mine, waking up in tears, not sleeping for days, Toms River, Colorado, Vermont, the full moon, 3rd street, Bernice Street, Mehum, High School, Cutting holes in long sleeve shirts for my thumbs, wearing long johns, candle lit streets, being arrested on my birthday, laser light shows, Playing music at a wedding, my first time at the grind, running on a golf course, Rockledge Video and air hockey, sex, chapstick, the way cold air feels in warm lungs, sonic pinball, cuddling, Heather Glen, The first Owen recordd, the gainesville blues fest, Jaret Ferratusco, sleeping in mall parking lots, being drunk, being straight edge, the first day on the sunny day tour in Winston Salem, Athens, my parents, The rocky horror picture show, Chai tea, what life used to mean, what life means today, being sick, being sad, being tired, being happy, being alive."

"event","I go above and beyond, but for what? Its funny how you can feel 10 all over again. Your parents snooping through your room looking for the things you've done wrong. Guilt over what? I honestly feel like I have made enough changes. Why am I the one to adapt? Why does it seem to be so wrong for me to enjoy anything. I dont enjoy work, I dont enjoy the business that is musicianship, i dont enjoy school. Life is full of ""do nots."" What ever happened to enjoying things? Somehow I work hard for everything I have and its all for nothing. 
Nothing I do will come out right. 
At will's this evening I watched as a young woman won the gold medal. She was Greek and as they sang her anthem and lifted her flag she began to cry,  so did I. IT was remarkable to witness someone's life work pay off. I dont know if I was crying because of amazment or the fact that I know I will never achieve that. 

It seems to me that i work so hard. Can't I be cut a break, just for once? Just one moment where someone will be like, ""You know, Jeremy is a good person and does everything. I am going to let him relax for this one second he has to himself.""

Tonight Sam Rivers made me want to quit music forever. Simply Amazing.
I am done, thank you. I officially quit. 

With a weak heart and  soft spine,
Jeremy Angel Perez-Cruz"

"event","HEllo everyone. i am writing from the lovely home of Lauren and Lynn Marinette. It is more like a castle. Some place out of a movie. No one in this house really plays an instrument but there are lots of very expensive instruments and recording devices thrown about rooms. It is more than a distraction for us.  I could go on forever but I'll leave it at this. There is an extra tiny little door int he front of their refrigerator, so you can have more convenient access to your favorite beverages.

Just for the record I miss my Erika.

Tour is going well. Everyone should join us in celebrating our homecoming. August 20th at Carver in Melbourne. go to www.myspace.com/sleepinggirldrowning for details."

I love my Erika. She is always sad so i assume she doesn't like me."

"event","Erika had to take our child to live elsewhere. He began the inevitable act of barking and so he must live separate from us for a few months. I am more than a little heartbroken, and I don't think he should have had to go so soon. I am going to miss his little burrito body and cocktail weenie legs. I love my skurvington and can't wait until I move, therein we can be reunited."

"event","So I finally got the van. Time for celebration. What better way to celebrate then drive to the alternate dimension known as Palm City. Where 16 year olds pull up in hummers and mercedes prepared for the festivities at hand. It is a wondrous land of mini skirts and soccer cleats, where there is a BBQ outside of every show. The catch is no one wants to be inside for the show, all of the loud music and unsavory characters aren't really their cup of tea. No, no, no, everyone plays in the summer twilight by the ocean, chatting about yachts and who's parents own more investments. Banter about who slept with who in the back of little jimmy's land rover. ""Did you look at my girlfriends ass?!?  Well thats alright because I slept with your girl yesterday"" Ahhh yes, the wonder of beautiful palm city, the gem so delicately planted on florida's coast.

In other news, Erika is hot, Skurvington has lost his mind, and I locked my keys in my car for the second time in a week.

Battle of the bands today, come out and vote...fuckers."

"event","Scott told me ""Your life is hell"" today. I feel that way more often. Why do i do so much? I could be happy with a girl and a dog, in an apartment, working. But instead I stretch myself thin, and am always broke and dont eat for days on end. I am always stressed- whether it is money, vans, drummers or girlfriends. 

Do I even like my life?

I need someone to drive to tampa with me in the morning soo i can pick up said van. IT is a shitty trip for no benefit to yourself. So who's down? 

I didnt think so."

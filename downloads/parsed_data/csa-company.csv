However this isn't entirely bad news, at all this means the dresses do not cost as much as they should. I am open for the secound batch of group orders once the new prices have been set up ^-^ please check with us often^_^!<br /><br />Good news!<br />I am sure that everyone who has participated in the first group order has recieved my email ^_^. If there is anything you do not understand please feel free to ask me anything!Your order has been sent and is being made as we speak ^o^ They should arrive about&nbsp;middle or end of July&nbsp;and then I will seperate all the dresses and send to you once you have paid the <em><u>secound payment</u></em>. I hope upon recieving your items that you would perhaps concider writing us a review ^_^ and take many pictures of our items!<br /><br /><u><em>Secound payment</em></u><br />(group order shipping divide by # buyers) + (your choice of shipping to you)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I really like progress^0^!<br />Even if it's slow it's getting somewhere and you know your achieving something^^<br /><br />Today Tracy showed me a new rose she made and how she's changed the back and try to attach a bobby pin to it. We're still deciding if a comb type or bobby pin would be best to hold it in one's hair. The one she made last night is black one with bobby pin fastening^^ it's gorgeous!<br /><br />The dresses haven't arrived and my secound and third designs no pictures yet but I'm anxious to see them ^0^!!!!!! i'm not sure about prices and sizes yet, but for now ^-^!!! happi *~*~!!!!<br /><br />Now here's the biggest progress update today^^!!!

But it really shows how well, this item is made ^^! and copied too other then fabric choice *sigh*<br /><br /><img height=""337"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa214/crazisilverangelcompany/product/M006b.jpg"" /><br />Gorgeous isn't&nbsp;it?!

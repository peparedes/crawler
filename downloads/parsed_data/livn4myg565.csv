I can't describe how horrible i feel...i don't know what to do without him...now who's gonna call me just to tell me i'm beautiful...who's going to draw me little pictures showing things we were supposed to do together...who's going to ask before he kisses me???  I just don't understand why he had to leave me...why are there still murderers and kids that do other people harm, still walking around? i just can't understand...i try and comprehend that ""everything happens for a reason"" and other phrases like that but the truth is, none of that brings him back, or makes me miss him any less."

"event","Oh JEEZ i'm stressed right now with school...i have a HUGE ass project due on Thursday for english and i'm workin my tail off to try and finish it on time.  However, it is now the B-E-A-Utiful month of may and things are going pretty good for me.  Prom is THIS SATURDAY, can you believe it?!  I'm real excited about it...i think i'll look pretty in my dress.  Let's see...and i'm kind of seeing someone right now...he's a really great guy and tho he's asked me out, we're ""taking it slow""...on my terms, for once.  I think my problem in the past is that i've just jumped right in without testin the waters first.  Now, i'm being smart first, and asking questions, like ""does this guy know how to treat a girl"" and such.  And so far, the answer is yes, to him.  However, i did just have a HUGE falling out/asking out/being dumped drama-saga the weekend of the band gatlinburg trip...two weekends ago...yea that was HORRIBLE...in fact, that's kind of how i got to REALLY kno the guy i'm seeing...he was a super-duper friend to me when i went through all that shit with the other guy...and who nows, now it's turning into something more.  I mean, if i were the person i was two months ago, i'd already be goin out and makin out with this guy, but i've changed...i've learned and let go and i think i'm better for it...at least, i hope i'm better for it.  Ok well i have to go work some more on that stupid project, and straighten my hair..well, cause i got it cut and it looks real good, straightened.  Ok, lovelovelovelovelovelove! (especially to Bethalamus!)"

"event","Wow...for the first time i know what it feels like to ""keep my options open"".  I have three guys who would make great boyfriends and i'm not dating ANY of them.  They all have their different complications.  Some...more than others...but thats ok.  And no, it's not like i'm leading them on...or vice versa, they all kno I'm not exclusive with anyone, and neither are they! Its just nice to have several guy friends that i can talk to.
    Ok so the Little Women Dance was last weekend, and it went real well.  Besides the fact that the actual dance fizzled out at like, 11 pm, but other than that, it went great!  Me, Sarah, and Dave all went downtown to the fudgeshop at like, 11:15 and on our way back to the car at midnight, we stopped to watch them making the movie, and John Travolta came out! How exciting, i got an autograph, and Dave took pictures! Wow that was an experience alright. 
    Ok, even though i had a prom dress crisis, i figured things out and my dress is beautiful!  I can't wait to wear it and feel like a princess.  I think me n Jordan are goin to look at flowers for each other today after school before he has to work at 5.  That should be fun.  I don't know what type of flower i want tho, hmmm...i'll have to think about that...ok well enough thinking for now, i have to go to lunch!"

"event","Well, it's been a real long time since i last wrote in here...hmm...a lot has changed...to start out, i think i'm losing my best friend.  She now has a boyfriend and barely talks to me.  She actually asked me today if i knew about my ex and how he was doing crack and havin sex and i was like, ""um, yea i knew"", and i wondered how she knew. She says: ""Oh, i found out last week..."" and i had just found out yesterday!  I couldn't believe she didn't tell me.  So when i asked her WHY she didn't tell me, she just said she ""didn't have time""  ...yea, cause all she ever does now is have 3 hour conversations w/ her bf.  And they've been officially dating for how many days? oh yea, two.  She now only wants to do somethin with me if HE's busy.  Wow, i just feel like shit.  And i can't even do anything about it, cause what am i supposed to do? tell her that i feel neglected? yea, right.  That'd be in interesting convo.  No, i can't do anything because she's soooo into him... and the worst part is that i know him really well...cause we used to be really good friends...but now that he's dating my best friend, we barely speak..in fact the other day he insulted me right in front of her and tried to make her choose between us....and can you guess who she chose? i'll give you a hint...it wasn't me.  
    Buuuut, on the bright side, i'm havin excellent fun w/ guys right now.  On monday i asked my maybe-more-than-friend to go to Bausch and Lomb w/ me and we did and it was really fun.  Then yesterday afternoon by chance, i saw Dave (whom i'm takin to the Little Women Dance....!!!) at the Fudge Shop and we drove around town for awhile lookin for Wooly Willy (a toy he needs for a French Class project)...ahh, but the evasive Wooly was not to be found...then last night Jordan (my date for prom...!!!)) called and wanted to kno if i wanted to go to a concert in Jax w/ him n his cousins on sunday night, and i really wanted to go, but my mom wouldnt let me.  So i told him we needed to go see a movie next week sometime...so we prolly will.
   Omg, tonight is Little Women and we're makin our speeches if we're runnin for a position on the Board.  Which, i am.  I'm running for Corresponding Secretary, which is the secretary that like, takes care of talking to other clubs, and writing thank you notes, and booking hotel reservations and stuff.  So i really want to get it.  I'm also gonna run for Secretary of my class, too..i think..or maybe treasurer..i don't remember which one i signed up for...all i kno is that i really wanna be an officer so that i can have a say in our prom planning.  Ms. Eells said that her core-group of decision makers would be the top four officers (pres, vp, sec, treas.)...
....i can't believe i get to go to THIS year's prom! yaaay! my dress is sooo gorgeous...it's a corset in the back! and i already got all my jewelry and shoes (flip flops...lol) and all i need now is a little gold handbag...sooo exciting! i even kno exactly how i want my hair done, i found a pic in a magazine and i'm takin it in to the salon..its sooo pretty. OMG i can't believe we're going to frickin RUTH CHRIS for dinner?!!  My parents haven't even been there, it's so expensive!!  man..and a limo...wow its gonna be so much fun....later for now...almost time for lunch!"

  Alright, whoever is leaving those really rude anonymous comments on my lj, u need to shut up or at least have the balls to say who you are.  Does it make you feel better to insult people?  That's REALLY screwed over and you need to stop, asshole.

Ms. Susie said i have to wait two more weeks if i want to get them off and only have to wear my retainer at night, not all the time.  I opted for waiting.  I always lost my retainer when i had the all-the-time one.  
  Omg, big news.  a guy friend asked me out.  i think i'm going to say yes...he's sooo sweet and he makes me feel so great.

   Omg i have headaches now like, every day.  i know its because of my eyes...i'm not wearing contacts because my eyes keep changing... so i always have to squint to see anything...its sooo annoying.

   Wow....rando...Shelly called me yesterday...thank goodness i wasn't there to answer it...but he didnt leave a voicemail. so theni  tried to call him back at like 10 p.m. and he didnt answer and still hasn't called back.  wierd.  really wierd considering i haven't even spoken to him since he made a surprise appearance at our church concert on like...December 2nd!  geez he needs to find some girls his own age...
   Well...talk about a bruise to my ego...neither of the guys i'm interested in called over winter break.  gawd.  o yea and the guy i called to invite to a party(different guy) but had to leave a message?...yea he never called back.  what the hell is wrong with me? i should just hole up and hibernate...not go out...not pursue anyone....geez i might as well wear sweatpants and a tshirt everyday...
   ok enough w/ the problems.  on the bright side, my room now looks much better due to the gorgeous new bedset i got for xmas.  its purple and has random embroidered flowers on it.  and its soooo comfy.  i now have a topsheet, then a featherbed, then a comfortor! yay! warmth all around.  
   wow is anyone else hooked on Starbucks Frappuccino's like i am? wow i can have one of those for breakfast and be on my way! ok well i'm tired so ttyl

"event","Wow, it's been a looong time since i've written.  I'm just really busy and don't have time to get on the computer lately.  And the fact that our internet is down every time I want to....doesn't help the situation.
   Let's see...to start...I work at the William's House downtown on 9th street now!!!  Yay!! I get $7.50 an hour...starting pay!!!  That is sooo much better than Coldstone....wow and i hardly have to do that much...not to mention that now i don't have a boss breathing down my neck telling me i'm not doing anything right!! I mean..its not like i've ever had to deal w/ somethin like that before....lol....
    Anyway....OMG i'm so sick of not having a boyfriend. I HATE seeing people all lovey dovey around me and just wishing someone felt that way about me...My friend told me a saying : ""Never frown cause you never know who's falling in love with your smile"".....awww, isn't that sweet? Wishful thinking...but sweet!..........Guys that send mixed signals absolutely kill me! Ugh!  But on a great note...I have a date for the Little Women ball!! Yay for me that i finally got the courage up to ask him! Jake (Reece...the guy) is sooo nice..he just makes people feel better when you're around him.  
    OMG i'm going shopping in Jax on Saturday for a dress/outfit for the dance.  And i think i'm driving too...clear the roads! No, i'm a great driver! and this'll be my second time drivin to jax too.
    OH MAN wanna hear an absolutely ridiculous story? (that actually happened to me)....Ok i liked this guy right? He's a year younger than me, really funny and popular and whatnot...anyway, i kinda got tha feeling he was interested in me too, so i had my best friend scope it out.  she asked him if he liked me, and he said ""Well can't you tell?...but i dont' have a chance with her...""  (aw, how sweet)  Well my friend proceeded to say ""Well, she kinda likes u too...so r u gonna ask her out?""  HIM: ""yea if i ever get the balls to do it""  Ok, the next two days we continue to flirt and don't talk about the fact that we both know what he said...and on the third day....i find out he asked out this girl in MY grade, who has practically NO PERSONALITY, DOESN""T talk, and isn't even that attractive!!! I about died.  so here i am, he KNOWS that i like him, yet i have to see him every day with this girl! and now, we don't even speak anymore, when i used to talk to him 2 or three times a day!!!  Now, my best friend claims to know what happened: He really didn't believe her when she told him that i liked him, and then he heard that this other girl liked him (which was, apparently, believable to him), so he just asked her out even though he doesn't like her.  My bf confirmed this with him and that's exactly what happened! But he still tells her that he likes me!!! OOOOOHHHHH I HATE THIS
     How exciting i'm getting my cell phone today or tomorrow...should u want to call me (if anyone's reading this) its 563-4474...its cingular...isn't that a wierd number? i think so...
     Ok well i need to go considering i'm in the period where i aide for a teacher so i'm out...

  Omg, I went and saw ""Raise Your Voice"" with Hilary Duff, and I balled like a baby.  If you have an older brother, you HAVE to see it.  I cried at like, 5 different times...I came out of the theater looking like a goth with an Abercrombie shirt on! Pretty funny.  But anyway the movie was sooo good, and it really made me think about how much i love my brother and what i'd ever do if anything happened to him.  I'm really lucky to have a brother that actually likes me and likes to spend time with me.  Speaking of spending time...
   ..We're going up to Furman U. to see him and his GIRLFRIEND (first serious relationship..exciting)  for family weekend...and I am eLaTeD! (big word)  I'm talkin about not only college guys, but their brothers coming to visit them! Ahhh...I can't wait.
   OMG i think I am bordering on infatuation with ****.(alright for the literals out there...just kidding)  He is basically perfect!

I'm supposed to get off a 6 tonight, but i'm gonna see if i can stay til nine.  Since i have to give up my shift for tomorrow...oh BTW, if youc an take my shift from 2-5 On SUNDAY, write back ASAP.  Muchos Gracias.  

Yesterday i wrote a song/poem.  I think it's stupid, but then again i did do it in ten minutes in class.  Turns out the subject of it was very near, making it really easy to put on paper.  I might post it.  Maybe not.  i don't need more buttwipes judging me and thinking they kno what's going on. 

My stomach allways hurts.  My mom said she's going to take me to the gastrointrooligist (wow that's a funny word).  It's so miserable

Ok well i have to get ready for work.

"event","AAH, my Nana's here for like two weeks!  She's soo cute and old!  My mom went and got her from Green Cove Springs today cause she hasn't had power for like 3 days and the heat was gettin to her.  Anyway, she's so much fun to be around and i'm glad she's here.

Well things are going better than I thought and it turns out those people KNOW i'm not deaf!!  

Aaw, I talked my friend who moved away tonight, and they aren't having a homecoming dance.  How sad for them.  I wonder how lame ours is going to be this year.  Last year i remember all the freshmen like, dressed up and everyone else was in shorts and halter tops.  Ha, that was fun. Good Times.

Well i'm tired and even though there's no SCHOOL tomorrow, i am going to bed.

"event","AAAh, what a bad night.  I mean really bad.  I love when people assume (Or choose to assume) that you are deaf.  They talk about you a few feet away and prettend you can't hear them.  Or maybe they're REALLY convinced you can't.  Anyway, to clear up any assumptions, no i am NOT deaf.

Now you're back....from outerspace....na na la la da da....with that sad look upon your face....i should've changed that stupid lock, i should've made you leave your key...if i'd have known for just one minute you'd be back to bother me....  
wow, me and Josh had waaay too much fun.  there's a little kareoke inside all of us i guess.

ok well i'm going to bed and i'm gonna try and NOT think about and dwell on my anger.  people tell me that's not good for you."

"event","How annoying.  How in the heck does EVERYONE at CS know about my friggin problems???  Oh yea, it's cause no one can keep their mouth shut.  i.e. DESTINY>>>THIS MEANS YOU! Yep, that's what i said.

No, I do not like James, never have and never will in THAT way.  But for some reason, everyone believes we're going out right now, even though we're not SPEAKING!! Yes, I know.

Ok so this hurricane crap is gettin annoying!  That's all i have to say about that.  

No, I'm not mad at Marilyn, why would I be? Or the other girl.  That i don't want to mention because i'm not THAT evil of a person as he apparently makes me out to be.

Ok well, it's been a long night at work, and Wayne, if you're reading this, (and Curtis) you guys were great tonight! Keep up the good work!

"event","Ok, here's the deal.  I'm sick and tired of people on my case! yes, a little dramatic, but still true!  KX is being a jerk and spreading her opinions.

How dare she call us 'best friends"" and then agree with the one who is causing me so much pain?

I know he practically paid N to tell me all that crap.  She knows I could honestly not care any less if i tried, about how much fun she had with him.  

Oh, and oculd he have been just a LITTLE more obvious in basically telling our MANAGER to pass it along who he was out with?  I swear I am prepared to never speak to him again.

Ok, well on the not-so-brighter side, I got a frickin' C on a Janeshak quiz today.  I hate that woman, she's the spawn of Satan!  

I'm seriously considering quitting work.  It's just getting too hard with him there breathing down my neck and telling me i'm doing things wrong.  Yet he's the one that practically blew up the whole place!! I must admit that was hilarious.  

Beth, if you're reading this, I luf you soo much!!  You would be one of the only things I would miss!!

Ok my homies (even though there is a slight chance anyone would read this) i'm out and i'll update later.

"event","OMG, why can't the drama just cease and desist alreadY!  i am StIlL mad at KU for all the hurtful things he's said and done, and he just doesn't get it.  and to make matters worse, my MOM talked to him today at work! how embarassing.  so then she bugged me about calling him tonight, and i was going to....but i just chickend out i guess.  i just know he'll rope me back in and within a week i'll be tellin him all my deepest secrets again.  i m so tired of getting hurt by people.  half the time i wanna spend hours on end with him, and the other half i'm thinking of how i can hurt him really bad, like he seems to do to me.  even if he doesn't know it.  i mean, i feel like while he doesn't want me, he doesn't want anyone else to have me either.  or maybe he does want me, but he just spends all his time denying it because he doesn't want the comitment or some other stupid crap like that.  but i just dont understand how he can tell me he ""doesn't have time for a girlfriend"" but literally a week later, he asks out a girl in our church youthgroup! (who promptly turned him down, and he still doesn't know i found about about it from the guy i think likes me) yea, can we say awkward....i find out about KU asking this girl out, from the guy i just basically WENT OUT with, while K is literally a few feet away.  ok, well i will update on this suckfest sometime soon, but for now i have to go to bed so that i don't look oddly tired tomorrow at church.  luv all"

today has actually be kinda shitty. woke up at 12. got online. Courtney got on a few mins after i did. 

she hasn't felt good at all today. i've tried to make her feel better. don't feel like its worked though. i hope that she got to take a nap and that her headache has gone away. she deserves to be happy. more then anyone.



somethin that i don't understand...why do people tell me that they're my friends and that they're ""always gonna be there"" for me. but they wont even fuckin talkin to me. i IM them and i get an Away Message. or i try to talk to them at school and they're like ""oh, i'm gonna be late. i'll talk to u later!"" 

people make me not want to talk to them. they'll just tell me lies...and then go behind my back and tell people what i've said."

anyways...here r the lyrics...


""Untouchable Face""

think i'm going for a walk now
i feel a little unsteady
i don't want nobody to follow me
'cept maybe you
i could make you happy you know
if you weren't already
i could do a lot of things
and i do

tell you the truth i prefer
the worst of you
too bad you had to have a better half
she's not really my type
but i think you two are forever
and i hate to say it but
you're perfect together

so fuck you
and your untouchable face
and fuck you
for existing in the first place
and who am i
that i should be vying for your touch
and who am i
i bet you can't even tell me that much

two-thirty in the morning
and my gas tank will be empty soon
neon sign on the horizon
rubbing elbows with the moon
a safe haven of sleepless
where the deep fryer's always on
radio is counting down
the top 20 country songs
and out on the porch the fly strip is
waving like a flag in the wind
y'know, i don't look forward
to seeing you again soon
you'll look like a photograph of yourself
taken from far far away
and i won't know what to do
and i won't know what to say

except fuck you...

i see you and i'm so perplexed
what was i thinking
what will i think of next
where can i hide
in the back room there's a lamp
that hangs over the pool table
and when the fan is on it swings
gently side to side
there's a changing constellation
of balls as we are playing
i see orion and say nothing
the only thing i can think of saying

is fuck you..."

Friday: nothing during the day, might go get a hair cut. not sure. then, tomorrow night after Courtney gets off work...i'm going to go kidnap her! HAHAHA!

Saturday: um, i'm not really sure. i kind of want to go to the flea market since i haven't been in a LONG time and since i wanted to go last weekend and didn't. AND...Courtneys NEVER been to a flea market...so, i might drag her to that. and me and her want to go to the movies too...so, might try to do that Saturday night. its all up to her though.

Sunday: probably nothing. but in the afternoon, i'll have to take Courtney home cause she has to work.

Monday: SLEEP!


i guess thats it...i don't really like to make plans though cause they usually get FUCKED UP!

She is <b>MY</b> world (notice ""my"" is capitalized and bolded ::glare::).  She is so amazing and beautiful.  I mean, you guys should see her while she's sleeping.  She's like.. perfection.. on two feet.  Sometimes on her back. >.>

The way I feel about her is completely indescribable.  I couldnt begin to put a compilation of words together that would do her justice.  She's that great.  Great is such an inferior word.  It just doesnt fit.  I'd need something bigger, better.  Though there are no words big enough, good enough, to describe her or my love.

Magan, baby, I love you so much.  I love you enough to break in and profess my love to your entire friends list.  :)

i called Sandra earlier and she was cleanin her bathroom. and she said that the toilet brush looked like a douch (i seriously doubt that i spelled that right, but you get the idea). so i made a comment that she was cleaning the toilets vagina cause its dirty. at this time, we're laughin SO hard. then she said the toilet it like a person cause shit goes out the back. which was fuckin funny. then she asked me what its called with men take a shit and the shit sticks to the hair on their ass, i didn't know so i asked my mom. that was GREAT! i couldn't stop laughin long enough to ask the question. then we got back to talkin about the toilet. then we came to the conclusion that we're all pediphiles (i think i spelled that wrong too, don't care) cause if u notice that toilets r white...and its a vagina...so it has no hair on it. another conclusion that we came to was, that its like a little girl. then Sandra says ""and we give it GOLDEN SHOWERS!"" so...what we've come up with is that we all like to give little girls Golden Showers.

rented movies last night. me and Coty did. we rented, Shaun of the Dead, Napolean Dynamite, and Gothika. i've never seen any of them. they're were pretty good, except for Gothika. that was kinda lame. my opinion. 

my mom is bein a bitch to me, as usual. she called me a bitch cause i wouldn't go with her to Wal Mart. *shrug* 

Coty is being a bitch to me too. nothing unsual there either. he tried to hit me in the back of my head with the remote cause i made him get up and get it instead of handing it to him. OMG! HE HAD TO GET OFF HIS ASS! what a fuckin tragedy!

yesterday after school, i took Jerry and Holly home. me and Coty ended up stayin at Hollys for a little while. Holly suggested that we all go somewhere...""like, to the movies or something."" Coty suggested White Noise. Holly said that it sounded good. so they decided that i would drive us out to Palace Pointe so we could see it. Holly had to be home by 10 so we went to the 6:45 movie. was fine with me. i didn't really want to go but i did. 

the movie wasn't that great (in my opinion). don't waste ur money.

after the movie we got somethin to eat...well, holly did. i paid for it cause i'm SO nice. me and Coty just ate some of her curly fries. 

Palace Pointe pisses me off. its full of preppy rich kids who think they're better then everyone else. i wanted to stab them all. the whole time durin the movie EVERYONE was fuckin talking! INCLUDING Coty and Holly. mostly Coty though. 

the whole way there Coty was like...""Palace Pointe is right up here!""....""right around this cornor! i know it is!""...and everytime, he was WRONG! me and Holly kept tellin him to shut up but of course he didn't listen.

Courtney sat down beside me and tapped me on the shoulder, when i picked my head up to look at her, she looked so sad. i asked her if she was ok...she wasn't. she started to tell me about what was wrong, then she put her hands over her face. i put my arms around her and she put her head on my shoulder. she started crying. i held her. she said she was sorry but she has no reason to be sorry. she did nothing wrong.

"event","okay...a lil odd that a lil gay dude comes up to me givin me a letter from some girl i don't know. i read the letter and it goes like this...

""hey

well my name is (name here) & you don't know me & i don't know you...but i think i have a small crush on you...& i want to explain how i feel but i don't have time to write it because they just called me to leave...so if you want to know then call me tonight (phone number here)""

(not gonna put her name in here cause i dunno if she wants people to know or not)

so..i called her when i got home...at 4. we talked, she explained. its kewl. didn't get off the phone with her until 6. cause my phone was DIEING! bastard. anyways, shes really kewl. i asked her to call me back later cause my phone was dyin and me and Coty were gonna go play pool.

me and Coty played pool for about an hour. then we came home.

i got online when i got home...she called me back on my cell. i told her that i was online, so she wanted me screen name. i gave it to her. got off of my cell phone and talked to her online. talked to her and my new lil freshman friend Sarah. 

let me explain about Sara...i never even talked to this girl until 2 days ago. apparently some lil black girls cornered her in the locker room while she was half naked and started callin her a ""lesbian"" and a ""bitch"" and all this other shit because she pretened to kiss another girl or somethin which is a bunch of BS cause i'm the only open lesbian in my whole school so i don't understand why they have a problem with HER and not ME. so, at lunch, i told this lil black girl i know (she also likes me) about what happened. and by the time i got through the lunch line, half of the lunch room knew. so, i got half the school lookin out for this girl sarah. but what was really weird is that after it happened. she sent Ashley (a girl that rides my bus) to come and get me. y? i don't know, considerin i've never even talked to her. but i told Ashley that i couldn't go get her but if she needed to talk to come get me outta class. and she did, Sarah showed up at the beginin of 2nd lunch and i went out in the hall and talked to her. she told me what happened. i'm dealin with it. 

and...whats even stranger is that, Sarah and the lil girl who wrote me a letter are friends. 

anyways...Courtney wrote on my arm in 8th pd yesterday...heres some of the things she wrote...
""eye luv yew""
""eye leek yer vujeyenu""
""yer kyoot""
""i kees yer nos""
""yer byooteefool""
""smyl yer sew purrty""
""kees me""
um, yeah....can u figure any of that out?

anyways, i'm gonna end this here...so...yes...

I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU! AAHHH!!

let see...this weekend wasn't too bad. Jessica and her ""husband"" came up from Wilmington and brought their BABY! AWWW! shes SO CUTE! her name is Makayla! 6 weeks old. AW! 

saturday i got up at 8 and at 8:30 i went to go let satan's friend's dog out cause she was out of town this weekend. got paid $12 for that. lol. then came back home and took a shower and ate breakfast. around 10:30 i left to go watch Courtney ref. soccer games. (got wind burn on my face) that ended around 2:30. i took Jessica home before the game was over cause she was gettin on her moms nerves and i figured that i'd be nice and take her so she'd leave her mom alone. my good deed for the day. then when Courtney got home, i went over there. she was takin a shower when i got there cause she was all sweaty from runnin around. i sat and talked to her mom while she was in the shower. then after that, we came back to my house cause satan called me and was BITCHIN. like always. once we got here, me, Courtney, Satan, Jessica, Kevin, and Makayla went to the mall. me and Courtney walked around while everyone else went to get Makayla's pictures taken. which took FOREVER! i bought a DVD. Courtney started to get a headache and her knee started hurtin so i bought her some coffee cause she wanted it and i'm SO nice. lol. bought myself a sprite. and i made her sit down while she drank it so that she could rest her knee. :D  then FINALLY they were done takin pics. so we came back here for me to get my bag then satan took me and Courtney back to her house where i stayed for the night. we didn't get to sleep until around 2 or 3 in the mornin. we was talkin (seriously). then i woke up at 8. WHY? i don't know. then i couldn't get back to sleep. then around 12 her mom came in her room and told us that we needed to get up. so we did. we ate some cereal...then salad a few mins later...then we went in her room and watched a DVD. then when that was over we went into the living room and ate again. then my mom showed up to get me. she was bitchin at me before we even started to back outta their drive way. cause EVERYTHING is my fault. like ALWAYS. oh wells, i don't care. i'm use to it.

today (monday) wasn't too bad. Courtney had a headache this mornin so she layed with her head in my lap. then i almost passed out in Civics cause all of a sudden i got REALLY tired. weird, huh? i slept a little in home room. then in art, i got harrassed! by Natalie! she kept blowin on me and tryin to touch me! Math was BORING like always! but i stole a bunch of STICKERS! lmao! and in chorus me and Courtney stuck them all over each other...she put them on my neck and my face and i put them on her legs. 

now i'm home with NOTHING to do and NO ONE to talk to cause everyone is ALWAYS too busy for ME!

well, you know what....FUCK YOU!"

"event","okay...well, my weekend has been...eventful. which is something i can NEVER say. but yea, its been fun...

Friday when we got home from school, Coty begged for me to take him to the football game at Webb. so i caved in and said ok. but i don't know where Webb is. so around 5 when Satan got home, i took her short-bus and went to get Jerry cause he said he'd help me find it. after a while, we found it. (i've really learned how to turn around, huh Jerry?). and considering i've only been to Oxford once of twice, i think i did a pretty good job. ok, so after we found Webb, Coty wanted me to take him to Miranda's (i didn't know where she lived either, but we found it). that was an interesting pit-stop. can we say REDNECKS! yes, thats what they are. when u go to someones house and hear 2 lil girls arguing ""its ur turn to get the kitty out from under the trailor! i did it last time!"" then u know u surrounded by REDNECKS! me and Jerry were laughin our asses off! it was funny. finally, i had to get outta there. so, me and Jerry went to Walmart in Oxford and walked around for a lil while. i bought a DVD, The Dark Crystal. then we walked over to the $1 store, walked around in there for a while. then we were told never to come back for tryin to steal a can of silly string. dumbass! after that, meand Jerry were mad, and hungry...so we  went over to the 96 Buffet and got some dinner. that was fun. we both got a plate of food, then a plate of STRAWBERRIES (each) they was GOOD! then Jerry got some HOT/sour strawberries. those weren't too good. then he got ice cream. some gay lil waiter dude kept starin at me. so i was talkin kinda loud that i AM gay but i don't suck dick, that i eat pussy! considerin that i'm a GIRL. lol. it was funny. then we went to potty and to pay the bill. when we left there, we went drivin around cause we was bored. turns out, we did a FULL circle. we were both kinda mad. it was also kinda funny to. so, while we were drivin, satan called and told me that it was gettin late and that she wanted me to go get Coty. then Courtney called, which was kinda pointless considerin that she didn't even talk to me but MAYBE 30 seconds. the rest of the time, she was talkin to her brother or channing. kinda made me upset. oh wells, right? anyways, after that, i called Coty and told him to meet me in front of Webb, he said ok. when i got there, where was he? not out front like i asked him to me, and people started beepin their horns at me cause i was in there way. and, i wont tryin to get shot, so, i moved. it was REALLY CROWDED. he finally found us though. then we came back here and me and Jerry watch the DVD i bought. after that, i took him home. Coty rode with me.


Saturday i didn't wake up until 10:30 cause Satan woke me up. BITCH! around 11 or 12, we went to Dollar General and Krogers. on the way home, we stopped and checked the mail. Jarry called me, we decided to go to Firemens day in Creedmoor. it was like 2:30 when we decided that. we didn't get there until 3:30. like, 10 mins or so before it was over. it was ok though. we walked around while we were there. talked about people. was fun. when we left there, we went to Satans friend John's house, to feed his puppy and to walk him (so he could do his business). he almost killed me. hes a BIG puppy. after the almost murder of myself by the dog, we came back here, dropped Satan off and me and Jerry went to South Point. Jerry directed me on how to get there, through DURHAM. was scary. ok, no really but yeah. we walked around South Point for a while. i bought a porn from FYE. i ain't watched it yet but i will. just not tonight(this mornin, considerin is 4:03am). I called Tara to ask her opinion on what porn to buy. that was funny. then me and Jerry went to Spencers and tried on ALOT of hats. that was fun. then Satan called and told us to come home. but of course we couldn't leave without gettin COOKIES! lol. after we got home. Satan decided that she wanted ME and HER to go out to Shooters. i didn't want to go cause i was TIRED but no. i had to go. so, i took Jerry home around 10/10:30. when i got back to the house, i changed clothes and we went to the ATM and then to Shooters. it was ok i guess but i was BORED! s yeah. didn't get home until 3am, took a shower...now i'm on here. blah.



and...i'm goin to bed now cause i'm TIRED! so, fuck off!"

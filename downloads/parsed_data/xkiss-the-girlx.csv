goodness. you called my house phone at 11:30 pm, on a weekday, and my mother, who was asleep, flipppped. not because you called late but because of your message concerning a party that night. my mom thought that i was going to sneak out and checked up on me every hour that night, but that's ok.

"event","when i got home today, i read old letters that i keep in my ballet shoe box under my bed.

anyway,
i've been taking things really personally lately.
sometimes i wish i could be as callous and indifferent as i had been 5 months ago.
well, no i don't, but i have been too sensitive, i think.

i feel that when i say that i dislike someone ""nonchalantely"", people think that my reasons for disliking that person are premature or even immature. i should probably stop saying that because i think about how people present themselves a lot, and i dig pretty deep into their nature. and i know that when i don't like someone, it's because they lack the insight to interpret my or any symbolism or the ability to successfully read between the lines; but when i say that i dont like someone, i never fill my conversationalist in on this analysis that i carefully conduct.


i suppose there is nothing wrong with dissecting people.
unless you do it incorrectly.
i don't take myself that seriously though, don't worry."

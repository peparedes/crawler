"event","So I havn't posted in about a year and I felt like typing tonight.  And since I can't print on this computer, writing on line just seemed to make sense.  It's been over a week since Aaron left... oh yeah... it's been over a year, so ya'll wouldn't know about Aaron.  
Well, Joe and I broke up last October... I think it was October, and went on a 5 month long pain spree where all we could seem to do was hurt eachother.  Of course at the end of the 5 months I was left wondering why the heck I started dating him in the first place.  He wound up following me around my college campus and hacking into my e-mail and spreading vicious rumors about me.  And eventually, making out with my best friend.  Really, is nothing sacred?  Apparently not.  But about 5 months after we broke up, I woke up and realized that my best guy friend would be a really great boyfriend.  He realized the same thing about the same time.  The only problems were that we had spent the last 4 months telling everyone that there wasn't a chance in hell that we would get together, and that he happened to be Joe's roommate.  
Now before you get all judgemental and crap on me I have to tell you that Joe and Aaron were forced into being roommates, that they didn't like eachother from the beginning, and that by the time Aaron and I actually started dating, they weren't roommates anymore.   Of course, anything Joe can do to make me look like a bitch, he'll make a grab at.  So obviously there has to be this big drama thing where everyone thinks that I'm the worst person to hit the planet since Hitler.  Thousands of dead people, a bad break up... obviously on the same level.  People are coming up to me and telling me how dare I start dating someone else when it obviously hurts Joe so much.  At the very least I should try to pretend like I'm not dating someone new so that the guy who was borderline stalking me can continue his dilusions that one day we're going to get back together.  
At what point are you allowed to stop taking the other person's feelings into consideration?  Can you do that at 3 weeks?  2 months? 5 months?  My best friend and I decided that if you date anyone for any length of time, you must stay single for at least two years, or until the more delusional/insane/self-centered/jackassish (pick one, some, or all of the above) of the recently broken up couple, finds someone new and gives their permission for you to date again in writen form, witnessed by a judge, priest, the President of the United States, and Bill Gates.  Anyway, I broke this cardinal rule of dating and am now dating a man who I consider to be the most wonderful man in the world.  And I'd tell you about him, except that this entry is really freekin long already.  So I'll tell you about him next time I write, or next year, which ever comes first."

"event","Have you ever tried to watch a pair of 13 month old twins for a day? Wow, that takes some energy.  I'm exhausted. But, not really what I wanted to write about. Apparently, my ex-bf's gf decided they needed to take a break.  Now this resulted in a few very very mixed emotions on my part.  I can't decide weather to be revengfully happy, relived (because I really didn't think they were right for each other), or sad for him.  Of course, since I can't make up my mind I had to make myself a dinner of sugar, fat, and beans... no not lima beans... coco beans.  I really am sad for him... I just wish I wasn't.  It wouldn't be easy to explain to Joe.  Oh well... I see him on Saturday! Yay! I can't wait.  bye ya'll"

"event","My mother kept saying that you have to take it easy for about a year after mono or it could turn into chronic fatigue syndrome. I pretty much forgot about that until I woke up this morning and realized that I did waaaaay too much this past weekend.  I had gone to bed at 9:30 last night and when I woke up I felt like I had never gone to bed.  So I called work and told them I couldn't make it today and went back to sleep.  I slept until 12:30.  So that makes about 15 hours of sleep last night.  Around 3 I started to feel better so I took about a half mile bike ride to the store and when I got home from that I realized that I made the right choice about not going to work today.  I was so tired after that half a mile that there's no way I could have made 4 miles today.  Hopefully another good night's sleep will fix everything.  I hope so because I can't afford another days missed work.  Well, cross your fingers for me. Bye"

"event","okay, the beyond parts lame... but who really cares.  After work yesterday Ian picked me up and we went over to Jenn's house.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but whatever it was I wasn't disappointed.  I met two of her friends who she's talked about for FOREVER. It was nice to finally put a name to a face. HEY GIRLS IF YOU'RE READING! We spent the first hour bashi- wait... you never know who's reading.  Probably shouldn't say that.  But after the first hour we called Mike (last night nicknamed Jerkface!) to see if he was going to show up.  Yeah he didn't pick up the first time, or the second, or the sixth.  He ditched us... but oh well... we had fun leaving weird voice mail messages. (again: *cough* jerkface! *cough*) 
Then we moved on to Mad Libs.  That was seriously fun. Did anyone else know that Ian had a kinky side? Yeah, cuz I didn't. Someone had his mind in the gutter. Then again, we all did. Just for the record, he and Jen are cute together.  They need to be set up.  Who's gonna do that? The we played Spin the Bottle.  I'm taken so the guys only got kissed on the hand by me.  But I got a hot kiss on the lips from Jen.  Then we climbed into the hot tub and played truth or dare.  Jen enjoyed that.  But I'm sure she'll post about it, so I won't ruin it for the rest of you. 
We had a great discussion on the way home. And then it was seriously time for bed.  This post sounds really flat and bland... sorry about that. Anyway, gotta go.  Have a great day everyone. Bye"

"event","I told you I was bad about writing.  It's been over a year since my last entry.  Wow so much has happened.  For those of you who are waiting in suspense, yes I got back together with my ex and no it didn't last.  It lasted just long enough to have a few months of average sex. (hey it can't have been that bad for the first time right?)  Wow, talk about unfullfilling... So all that crap about having sex ruining your life isn't COMPLETELY true... but it's got it's moments... seriously, life would be so much easier!
Since then I've started college. (Great idea) Got a new boyfriend. (Even better idea) and gotten into shape. (Best idea of all.)  So I've gone through a change or two. I just started talking to my ex again... random time to restart my journal I know... oh well... I'm no longer working at the same job.  We can all give that an AMEN.  Instead I got an awesome 9-5 job as a nanny.  I started it last summer and they wanted me back this year... I highly recomend this life.  Good people, good hours, good pay.  Can you go wrong?  Anyway, time to sleepy sleepy.  For all of you who have been so desperately waiting for me to get on line again, I thank you for your patience and for your (okay lets face it) pathetic ammounts of support."

"event","Actually if I were to make a list on that topic, I'd be writing for the next week. 
So my ex and I are having a ""love affair"" as Ash puts it. I'm not totally sure that's how i would define it... but whatever floats your boat, hon. Last night we wound up crashing at a hotel. Don't ask how it happened, it's a long story. And no, we didn't have sex Ash. 
But something about my ex... my goodness... he's like a space heater. I sleep with four blankets on my bed, and a flannel sheet. And I was soooo incredibly hot with just one blanket and a sheet with him next to me. 
Anyway, I'm finding myself thinking about getting back together with him. And one part of me thinks that i've got to be crazy for considering this. And the other part of me says that I was as much to fault for the problems in our relationship as he was. How often do you find a guy who thinks you're gorgeous when you first wake up in the morning. Or who doesn't care if you cry and wind up with mascara all over your face? It doesn't happen every day. 
So I'm a little bit torn over this. And I think he is as well. Oh well. We'll just see what happens.

"event","So I'm in a better mood than the last time I wrote. I'm feeling just a little bit random today. I started talking to this guy I know yesterday. I've known him since I was 5, but yesterday was the first day we really talked. It was really awesome. He's totally different than I thought he was. Funny how that works. We've got a lot in common. I said something that made absolutely no sense and he came back with, ""Oh! That makes so much sense! I know exactly what you mean!"" It's one of those things where you're both so much in the same place that it doesn't matter how little sense it makes, it makes all the sense in the world. 
My brain is completely fried tonight. Not exactly the best. I can't decide if I should sleep on the floor tongiht or if I should sleep in my bed. And I just figured out why this sausage tastes so weird! It's elk sausage! 
Anyway... now that I know that... I'm gonna go watch star trek... yes I'm a trekie, so shoot me!

"event","I saw Mike today. For those of you who don't know me, Mike is my ex. We havn't talked for 6 weeks, although I didn't know how long it had been until he mentioned it. We started talking again last night. At first it was okay. And when I saw him today it started out okay too. Although, I guess the whole day it was okay. But he hasn't changed. Nothing is different. And now I'm so confused. 
 When I'm with mike I'm this confident, know-where-i'm-going-in-life person. And then I'll get a whiff of how his shirt smells and suddenly I'm transfored from a woman into this terrified little girl who needs to be held and told that everything is going to be alright. I used to steal his shirts to sleep in because they smelled like him. For some reason they always made me feel so safe. But he can't control his own life so how could he control mine? 
I was lying in bed tonight and thinking about today. I was listening to this music. I don't know what I want or what I need. But somehow the song knows. The music is singing what my heart is dying to say. If only it were in words. 
Those six weeks that we weren't talking; they started out horrible. I couldn't think and everything was falling apart. And finally things started to get easier. I would see him on line and be dying to talk to him, and tell him about my day; or whatever. But I couldn't because we weren't talking. But it was getting easier. It's this strange thing. Because for some reason; I need him. And I don't want to. Maybe it has something to do with our history. Or maybe it really does have something to do with how he smells. I'm sitting here now and I can almost smell it. I don't know how to describe it. Bu it makes me want to curl up and fall asleap. Because I know as long as he's there; everything is going to be okay. 
But everything isn't okay. Everything is careening out of control. I saw Mike and I'm back to being completely helpless. 
On a more positive note: I got a tattoo today. And I'm thrilled with it. Although my mother isn't. She tried to be supportive but she looked a little strained. right now I'm exhausted. it is waaaay too early in the morning for anyone to be up. 
Mike if you ever read this: If I don't see ya; goodmorning goodevening and goodnight"

"event","I'm pathetic. You'd think that 13 years would be long enough to convince me that something with this guy is never gonna happen. But the thing about love is, no matter what you do to kill that hope that something just might happen, love keeps on bringing that hope up again and again and again. 
I keep on thinking about what I would say to him if I ever got a chance to explain myself. And with all the grand speaches I have planned and the eloquent wording I've thought up, I'm sure I'd end up with... uuuhhh... And then something guarenteed to drive him away. That's just how I am. 
It's funny how the smallest things can remind you of something. A word, or a song on the radio brings up all these different memories. Memories you didn't even know existed. It's funny how those memories change into dreams. Almost like you want to connect the past, to the present and then to create a future by combineing the two. You know those dreams are never going to happen. Life isn't a romantic commedy where no matter what screw ups happen, in the end she always ends up with the one she always wanted. 
I watched Sweet Home Alabama tonight. And there was this scene where they kissed. Suddenly I was in the scene almost. It's like I've forgotten what it's like to be kissed, and just for that one scene there, I remembered. It sucks being in love. Because when you're in love, there's always an element of pain. But love teaches you things. It inspires you to learn lessons you never would have learned otherwise. I've learned patience these 13 years. Patience and how to keep hope alive and how to dream and how to live life and dream at the same time. Because you can't just dream and forget about now.
The problem with love is that it involves passion. And passion is exhausting when there's no outlet for it. I immagine that it's exhausting even when there is an outlet for it. But when you have to hold it all in and let it out in these little day dreams that you have; it's torture. It builds up and then you make up this day dream that's so real you can almost almost touch it. And when you finally wake up you wonder if it didn't really happen. Because while you were dreaming you could hear it and feel it and taste it. And then you sound absolutely insane when you talk about it. 
But that's the problem with love. So my little bit of passion for today, this message is for my beautiful:
If I don't see ya' Goodmorning, goodevening, and goodnight."

Ash and I watched ""How to loose a guy in 10 days today."" The only bad thing about chick flicks is that I'm always left upset that I don't have a bf. Stupid I know. The problem with chick flicks is that there is absolutely nothing real about them. Since when do guys spout romantic lines and speaking up really makes a difference in a relationship. It's so unrealistic. I guess i'm just exhuasted and cynical right now.
I miss talking to bry because he's never on line anymore. And when he is on line, he's talking to Kristie. And when Kristie isn't on line, he's talking about Kristie, or thinking about Kristie, or planing something for Kristie. In other words his life revolved around a girl I've met once and talk to every once in a while on line. In other words, I'm fading fast into the group of ""pre-gf friends.""

I seriously need a raise. Reviews are coming up and I'm really not sure if I'm going to get one or not. I'm hoping for a big tax return.
So I've been thinking about something for a while now and I've decided to go through with it. I'm going to get a tatoo. I'm totally freeked out about needles so I wasn't sure if i wanted to get one. But I really do want one. It's gonna be really small and in a place that I can hide it easily. So it won't cause a problem at work.

Oh yah... that money thing that everything hinges on. what a pain!
I'm really tired, and i'm going out tomorrow. I was hoping that Bry would call me and tell me why he was so pissed off. But he hasn't. I'm guessing he's still in the hot tub.

I'm about 3 inches away from the ground on my middle splits, I'm within centimeters on my right side and I'm 2 inches away on my left side. I'm doing the crunches. I'm walking an average of a mile and a half a day and I'm watching what I eat. I'm looking at myself in my cami and pj pants and I'm thinking I'm really close to looking really hot. At least in my own humble opinion... I'll get Ashley's opinion on Friday when I see her. 
I really am completely shocked at how flexible I am still. It's been a while since I was really good about stretching. And I'm a also a little amazed that my leg strength is still decent. I really need to take a dance class or two. My form sucks. 
I could swear there's a guy at my work who likes me... the funny thing is, he's still in high school. I don't rob the cradle... espcially not that small of one. teehee. But he'll tease me like crazy and then give me compliments about just random stuff. I'll catch him watching me which is hillarious and sweet at the same time. 
The other day my bra strap broke and I had to explain it to my manager so she'd let me go back and fix it. He was standing right there, and since then he's been teasing me about it. No... it's not sexual harassment. We all make sexual jokes now and then. If anyone is offended they say something and the joking stops. but there have been a few times when I know the whole ""bra strap thing"" has been on his mind. I'm just laughing about it.
I've gotta figure out what to wear tomorrow though. And I've got to wash it. Why is it always so hard to find something cute but appropriate for work? Hey, cute guys come into work... gotta look good.
But on a serious note, I really do miss Kris. I don't know why it's so bad right now. Usually, the whole ""missing him"" thing eases up a week or so after he leaves to go back to college. This time it hasn't. I know him better now and I'm completely intrigued. What can I say. I'm hopeless. Ash there's a reason I don't want to ""f*** Bry"". I'm waiting for my Prince Charming and praying like crazy it's the one I've always wanted it to be. Sorry... bry is no PC. He's just bry, as much as I luv him. Wow... long entry. anyway... ttfn.

The whole space shuttle thing was really disturbing. I watched the television for 20 minutes before I heard anything about the people on board. It was so stupid. They were so busy talking about how a space shuttle is made and how people were taking the pieces home as souvineers that they totally brushed by the people aspect of it. The astronauts families were standing right there watching as it blew up! It's horrible. And then the senator was standing there talking with his sweater over his shoulders. It looked like he thought how he looked for the cameras was more important than what he was talking about. It's really sad. 
I got this whole day dream thing going about Kris. It's really pathetic. End of the story we end up married with two kids. I'm really really sad this way. Of course in this day dream any current girl he has is a complete bitch and is entirely self-absorbed. And knowing him he probably has a girl who is soooo sweet and is totally deserving of a guy like him. So the whole day dream is kinda unrealistic. But who said day dreams had to be realistic? 
I spent the entire first part of the day wanting to hurt someone... and I wasn't sure who yet. I had it narrowed down to either Bry, one of two guys on line, the senator on tv today or Kristie. Bry because he can only talk about Kristie these days. The two guys on line because they think ""hi"" means ""oh please screw me!"" the senator on tv for reasons mentioned previously, and Kristie, because bry can only talk about her. 
So yah... That's about all I have to say for right now. And I want to watch ""meet my folks."" so ttfn. If I don't see ya. Goodmorning Goodevening and Goodnight!"

"event","Most of us will never know how dark this world can seem 
When life becomes more nightmare than a dream. 
So to all of you who have survived a visit to the edge, 
I trust that you will understand this pledge.
I promise I will always leave the darkness for the light 
I swear by all that's holy 
I will not give up the fight 
I'll drink down death like water 
Before I ever come again 
To that dark place, where I might've made 
The choice for life to end.

I've found that as I've traveled through the inscape of my life 
That mountain tops make valleys in between. 
And when that nameless sadness like a cloud comes over me, 
I look back on all the brightness I have seen.

I promise I will always leave the darkness for the light 
I swear by all that's holy 
I will not give up the fight 
I'll drink down death like water 
before I ever come again 
To that dark place, where I might've made the choice for life to end

And realize that though my world might seem so torn apart. 
Most often it is joy that breaks the heart. 
And that I am the richest man, though I must beg for bread 
For the very one who might condemn has called me friend instead.

There have been so many songs that have brought me through difficult times. You know how they are. They are the songs that you listen to while you cry; and even though the song makes you cry, it also seems to make everything better. This song, however, has become my battle cry almost. It's my oath to myself. During those days when I think that everything is against me and that there is no way that I'll get through to a litterally brighter day, I know that I've promised myself that I'll never give up.

I am, as of now, on a diet. But then again, that happens about once every 3 months. But this time I'm determined to make this one work. Girls I'm sure you know what I'm talking about with the yoyo dieting. But I've lost 6lbs and hoping there's more to come. I'm gonna look good in the bikini this year. I've got it hanging in my closet as motivation. 
There are a few people who I should probably tell you about before I start ranting and raving about them. First would be Bry. You'll probably hear a lot about him. He's my best friend right now. Unfortunately, I don't think the feeling is mutual. Although it was four months ago. Between then and now he's found a new girlfriend who has become his sole fixation in life. So I'll probably rant about her a bit. That would be Kristie. And then there is my Prince Charming. His name is Kris. And you'll hear plenty about him too. 
My life tends to be pretty dramatic between a few slightly twisted friends and being pretty screwed up myself. But at least it's not boring. 
I am a drama queen. So if they bother you, I'm sorry. I try to keep it toned down. But it doesn't always work. Anyway, that's all I have to say. So ttfn.

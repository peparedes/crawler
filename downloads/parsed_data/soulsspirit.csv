"event","Well, I have just about had a fucking nuff tonight. I put so much work into my site to hear that a few elitist people consider it too new age... or not spiritual. What a pile of bollocks, what the hell isn't new age these days? Personally, I always found Paganism somewhat new agey, as do most people...this whole candle burning, praying to the God and goddess nonsense if we want to get down and dirty and use generalisations and little labels. I am so pissed off. Thank god I have a couple who support me. Shame it isn't the people who should be supporting me!

I find it absolutely astonishing anyone can consider a forum that has areas for all beliefs and religions...new agey. But, whatever. I am thinking now of simply closing it down. I only have to tick one box to turn the board offline. So many other 'new age' boards out there, I am sure people will find somewhere to go, right! I imagine those labelling it new age would soon be lost if I started approaching it from a more advanced angle and casting off those new to their spiritual paths!"

"event","Well, goodness, it is a struggle to keep up with my lj on a daily basis these days, mainly due to the responsibilities of running my forums and moderating on another site. I do hope no one is too disappointed in me. I do suggest that my friends here join the site if they wish to communicate and share more with me, but no worries if you do not wish to. It is mainly spiritual and paranormal, yes, but there are also sections for games and quizzes, a general section, a support section and myths and legends section. In truth, it covers a lot of ground.

Anyway, other than that... things are interesting. I seem to be back with my ex, who I lived with for over five years, but had not seen in 18 months since I left him. I just had the impulse to catch up, and had not expected us to end up carrying on as if nothing happened... it is one of those occasions where my expectations were wrong. I had thought it would be awkward and that he would be detached... we were talking right away and he was not detached at all. 

I am, as usual, way behind on my university work. I am, as usual, very tired...but then, I have only had maybe 6 hours sleep. I have had a lot of crap from the woman who runs the site I worked on before I opened my own, and from the 23 year old who designed her site appearance and is her co admin... I had the most unpleasant and threatening message, accusing me of copying their colours etc...you get the picture. It is very sad and disappointing for a spiritual site, and even more so that the site owner, who claimed to be my friend, feels such a message, which labelled me pathetic, is justified. 

I hope all my friends on here are well... I promise I will try and catch up on your journals this weekend and pass out some comments. Feel free to give me a slapped wrist for being so lax."

"event","I cannot deny it, I have pinned a lot of hopes on my forums but things don't seem to be moving. Maybe I expect too much after only 3 days, but I have been posting links in endless lj groups and on some internet sites, I have over 50 members...but only a couple are posting, and even then, not a lot. The problem is I am doing it alone. I have no-one able to moderate on a regular basis...and it is too much for one person to keep up with. I can only post so many topics a day. So, I am left feeling a little down right now. The site looks lovely, but clearly I must be doing something wrong? I still have no homepage either. 

3 days in and I am feeling tempted to just abandon it. Other forums of this size usually start with a few people running it, not just one, or at least with some staff who can post new things each day to try and liven things up."

It is difficult trying to keep a forums running, especially in the beginning while I am trying to recruit new members and find some to moderate and help me out. Got 31 members so far, in the space of two days but having some teething trouble. Have chatrooms on there too now, which really made me happy. 

I will try and catch up with your journals, I have read through some today and replied to a few... I feel terribly guilty for not being around so much, but remember you can catch me on my forums and talk to me there in the shoutbox..which is like a mini chatroom at the top of the forums... link is on my user info page. 

Other than that, I went over 36 hours without sleep...woke at 3pm uk time on monday and didn't go to sleep until 4am uk time today. I must have one hell of a strong constitution. I managed but I didn't feel that great. I am still tired. I just..have no idea really why I did that. I had stayed up all night working on the forums, then a friend came on msn and by time I finished with them it was 10am and I needed to be sure to get to shops...so I went to town, got back at 1pm yesterday and simply didnt go to bed."

I woke worrying about my forum and affirming that I ought to get some forum sections started so people have somewhere to post, even if all the other stuff isn't sorted yet. So, I will be working on that...I have a test forum there so people can submit ideas for sections for the site. I like the members to have stuff they want too. Just 4 members so far but it will take some advertising to get it off the ground once I have got my sections up...

<b>So if anyone knows any sites where my forums can be advertised, please let me know or go ahead and post the link when I am up and running</b>

I may have found someone to make me a skin in the colours I want and for free. Most sites charge $30 for a custom skin, it seems making things for these boards is big business now heh. I joined several forums and left a post asking for any help available to get me sorted. A man from Australia who owns one such site helped me skin the forum last night with a downloadable one, but he disappeared after a few hours. I am hoping he will return to help me as I still need help knowing how to upload the mods. 

I will be needing moderators for this forum, of course. People who have plenty to share with the members and who will be able to post in welcome messages as each member joins. Like most uk spiritual forums, this will not be paid which is why it is essential it is something that the person enjoys doing, lol. 

I am struggling to think of a general welcome message to my site. All the ideas are in my brain somewhere, but it is getting it down in words that is the issue. I also need a few ground rules as I really don't want to end up banning people left, right and centre. 

If anyone on my list has any knowledge of making homepages for websites and is willing to offer some help, please let me know as I cannot move forward on that part at all. If anyone has knowledge of using frontpage, please let me know as I downloaded it. 

Watching Star Trek 'Enterprise' at the moment. It is on terrestrial tv. I have so much work to do for university, maybe this was a bad time to have my forum started...as it seems to be all that is on my mind, lol."

      <lj-cut>A Minneapolis couple decided to go to Florida to thaw out during a
      particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the same hotel where they
      spent their honeymoon 20 years earlier. Because of hectic schedules, it was
      difficult to coordinate their travel schedules, so the husband left
      Minnesota and flew to Florida on Thursday, with his wife flying down the
      following day. 


      The husband checked into the hotel. There was a computer in his room, he
      decided to send an email to his wife. However, he accidentally left out one
      letter in her email address, and without realizing his error,sent the email.



      Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston, a widow had just returned home from her
      husband's funeral. He was a minister who was called home to glory following
      a heart attack. The widow decided to check her email expecting messages from
      relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she screamed and
      fainted. 


      The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw
      the computer screen which read: 



      To: My Loving Wife 


      Subject: I've Arrived 


      Date: December 20, 2005 


      I know you're surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now and
      you are allowed to send emails to your loved ones. I've just arrived and
      have been checked in. I see that everything has been prepared for your
      arrival tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then! Hope your journey is

"event","Which can affect certain aspects of our lives quite strongly...if you believe in astrology and the planetary influences. Anyway, here is an article on this retrograde and what it might affect in our lives. 



<lj-cut>On March 2, 2006, Mercury, the cosmic magician, turns retrograde in Pisces, the sign of the Fishes, sending communications, travel, appointments, mail and the www into a general snarlup! This awkward period begins a few days before the actual turning point (as Mercury slows) and lasts for three weeks or so, until March 25, when the Winged Messenger reaches his direct station. At this time he halts and begins his return to direct motion through the zodiac.

Everything finally straightens out on April 14, 2006, as he passes the point where he first turned retrograde. Mercury turns retrograde three times a year, as a rule, but the effects of each period differ, according to the sign in which it happens (see box for Retrograde Periods in 2006).

A planet is described as retrograde when it appears to be moving backwards through the zodiac. This traditional concept arises in the illusory planetary motion created by the orbital rotation of the earth, with relation to other planets in our solar system. Planets are never actually retrograde or stationary, they just seem that way, due to this optical illusion.

Retrograde periods, although often problematic for us earthlings, are not particularly uncommon. Each planet retrogrades, except the Sun and Moon.

<b>Fated Events</b> 
As a rule, retrograde planets presage a period of seemingly inevitable or fated events, which relate to their sphere of influence. They present us with a series of events over which we seem to have little or no control, relating especially to the sign in which the retrogradation occurs. For example, Mercury retrograde in Virgo presents quite different sets of circumstances from those generated when it retrogrades into Leo.

A retrograde period is best seen as a cycle, beginning when the planet begins to slow to a halt before travelling backwards through the zodiac and ending when the planet returns to the point where it first paused. However, during the cycle, the planet's energy is most powerful (and more likely to generate critical events of universal importance) when the planet makes a station, appearing motionless in the sky.

These stationary periods occur near the beginning of the cycle (when the planet first halts as it prepares to move backwards) and midway through the cycle when the retrograde planet slows to a stop before moving forward again. The ""direct station"" (when the planet halts before moving forward again) is the most powerful and can be used for maximum benefit.

Some astrologers consider that the ""Mercury Shadow"" begins some three weeks before the actual retro station (when Mercury passes the point of direct station for the first time), but I am more inclined to think that the really noticeable peculiarities begin when Mercury slows significantly, a few days before the retro station. This period of ""Mercury Shadow"" extends to the Return date, some three weeks after the direct station. Bear this in mind, because experience shows that the effects of the retro period are still marked during the ""shadow"" phase.

<b>What does Mercury affect?</b>
In general, Mercury rules thinking and perception, processing and disseminating information and all means of communication, commerce and transportation. By extension, Mercury rules people who work in these areas, especially people who work with their minds or their wits: writers and orators, commentators and critics, gossips and spin doctors, tricksters and thieves. 

Mercury retrograde gives rise to personal misunderstandings; flawed, disrupted, or delayed communications, negotiations and trade; glitches and breakdowns with phones, computers, cars, buses, and trains. And all of these problems usually arise because some crucial piece of information, or component, has gone astray, or awry.

It is therefore not wise to make important decisions while Mercury is retrograde, since it is very likely that these decisions will be clouded by misinformation, poor communication and careless thinking. Mercury is all about mental clarity and the power of the mind, so when Mercury is retrograde, these intellectual characteristics tend to be less acute than usual, as the critical faculties are dimmed.

<b>The Key Issue</b>
The key issue here is one of focus. Mercury's retro phase tends to bring unforeseen changes and blockages, but the aggravation and frustration that many of us experience during these periods is often due to our own inability to roll with the punches. Is this due to our ego-fixation? Mercury sets out to restructure our thinking processes and for many of us this is painful and frustrating. Moreover, these experiences reveal flaws in our internal organisation as well as our external planning, which can make us feel foolish and inadequate.

Mercury retrograde, like any cosmic aspect, affects people differently, depending on where it hits their personal charts. Some people actually prosper under a retro Mercury, especially if Mercury is retrograde but otherwise well-aspected in their birth charts. It is also a time when matters begun under a previous retro period will come to fruition, or completion as the case may be. Firm decisions that have been previously made when Mercury is travelling normally through the zodiac may be implemented or finalised while Mercury is retrograde without too much worry, for experience shows that this can be done without undue problems arising.

 
<b>Mercury Retrograde in Pisces</b>
When Mercury is retrograde, everyone's thinking is more introspective and we tend to think about issues and concerns which relate to the sign involved. With Mercury retrograde in Pisces, people with this sign prominent in their charts will be especially prone to such introspection. There is little choice but to reconsider our personal views and opinions about life. There is, however, an opportunity to gain insight into our own ego. 

Mercury retro in Pisces, the sign of his fall, creates mental and emotional confusion, with strange dreams and sometimes psychic experiences. Mental processes being entwined with emotions, we find it hard to separate ideas and opinions from passion and idealism. Our mental orientation can be unstable, unrealistic and overly-spiritual, but it also inclines to laziness and increases the urge to consume alcohol. Nervousness and stress, even unfounded fears and paranoia are stimulated, especially from working or living in a hostile environment. Maintain privacy and dignity in the working environment and don't try to read between the lines, when there is really nothing to find. 

As Mercury turns in stressful square aspect to Pluto in Sagittarius, people tend to become too intense or place too much importance on relatively innocuous ideas or pieces of information, and the likelihood is that the intelligence will be confused or misleading, especially if concerned with foreigners, faraway places, or religious matters. Don't waste time looking for hidden motives in what others are doing, when their actions may be perfectly innocent. Others take your ideas or actions far more seriously than you had intended. Valuable time can be lost, or you can jeopardize a position of personal power if you manipulate a situation, or the information and ideas you get from others, to your unfair advantage. Maintain a patient, reasonable attitude and take rumours with a dose of salts.

All areas of communication are affected, especially in any cultural pursuits, overseas matters or anything to do with travel, religion, academic pursuits, trading partners, adventurers and foreigners in general. This period brings travel snafus and missed appointments of all kinds. Documents can go astray. Be sure to carry a diary and refer to it often.<lj-cut>"

"event","Damn noisy things! I was woken up not once, but twice today by the phone. I swear, I am removing the extra handset from my bedroom, lol. It has a shrill and cutting ring on it and it always leaves me feeling crap when I am woken in such a sharp way. Anyway, it was the bank calling to tell me something I already knew...that my overdraft had gone overdrawn because(as I realised with horror last night when I looked to see the date was March 1st)I had not gone and transferred my rent money over from my other account. This woman sounded so... ungh. She ignored when I said I had just woken up(I couldn't hear her properly) and spoke as if running on automatic. 


Anyway, I am still all groggy, so going to shower. I have to go out and try and get a copy of 'The Fly'(I hate horror films) for my fantasy in film class and then get down to doing some serious work. I don't like it, but it has to be done. I am getting more and more excited about having my own spiritual forums. I have waited so long for this. I have spent years on other people's and finally, it is time to build up my own and use the lessons I have learnt from posting on those others so long...first will be to not be a control freak with lots of rules and regulations. 


You wouldn't believe some of these so-called spiritual sites, the backstabbing that goes on behind the scenes on them. Not only that, but those working on these sites seem to slide into this automatic 'love and light' mode, where they post the same thing automatically in response to any struggles members are having...like 'Sorry you are having such a hard time, hope you feel better soon xx'. To me, that is a cop out. I always made an effort to go into detail, to get involved...and I have never put on a love and light face because in truth, we all have a darker side, we all have our anger, our sadness, our various negative traits. How are members going to be comforted by seeing moderators who behave as if they are perfection itself? (while carrying on various dramas and bitching sessions behind the scenes)I am not the only one who has become disillusioned and left their role as moderator on these sites.

"event","<lj-cut>It does me good to go outside when it is dark. I am very much in love with night as much as I am in love with warm summer days. There is a certain atmosphere at night, especially when the moon is bright and visible. Sometimes, I just stand still and glance up at the sky to note its colour and if there are any stars. I used to be able to see one of the space stations where I lived before, the sky was so clear. Some nights, the night sky has this beautiful tint of red and indigo. 

I am a loner now. I never used to be that way. I am told that as a child, I was always helping others, always loving and always running around at full speed. Always talking to strangers, always trusting, until that trust was broken.

I just slid into being a loner as the years went by and I suffered more and more blows to my sensitive being. I am...too sensitive in many ways. Some people can take a lot of blows in life and be unaffected. With me, some part of me is indelibly and permanently scarred by every hurt in my life. It isn't a choice; it just is.

But I also am the kind of person to fight back and keep going... not for myself, but for any people who might come into my life needing guidance or assistance. This already happens frequently... I have lost count of the number who have crossed my path needing some sort of help before slipping away into the mist again. 

I have been told many times that I have some great purpose here. I often question it. At times, I have sat on my bed and begged to be taken back Home and to be set free, but I know it will not happen as my soul knows I have so much more to do. Don't get me wrong, I do not need advice. I am blessed or cursed with the ability to see all my mistakes as I make them, to see all my lessons as they are in progress, lol. Even as a child, I was aware of things not all children are aware of and I asked questions not all children would even consider. I would sit there thinking about death, wondering if it was just a black nothingness or if there was more, at a time when no-one had spoken to me of death, let alone the possibility of an afterlife. 

As a child, I would dream entire days before they happened. As a child, I would have horrific nightmares where I would dream of long past wars and even talk to soldiers. As a child, I would see children who were not physical beings. I know there are many who have had these experiences as a child, but likewise, many are told it is not real...all imagination. It must not be talked about, such  things do not exist. And then, you spend years trying to remember what it was to be free of all these boxes and cages, dos and don't, blacks and whites. Years trying to return to standing in the sunlight with unblinkered eyes.

<table border='0' cellpadding='5' cellspacing='0' width='600'><tr><td></td><td> You scored as <b>Pisces</b>. You get along best with the sign of Pisces. Although Pisceans can be very withdrawn, or hard to understand, they are extremely conscious individuals, and are very deep as well. Pisceans often have a very dry sense of humor. They are very mature (after all, they are the 'ELDERS of the Zodiac'), and are freakishly good at percieving the world around them, practically to the point of being 'psychic.' Few can understand the depths of these people, but the few who can remain close friends with Pisceans for a long time.  <br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Pisces</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='85' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>85%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Aquarius</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='75' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>75%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Scorpio</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='65' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>65%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Libra</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='65' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>65%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Gemini</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='60' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>60%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Aries</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='55' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>55%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Leo</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='55' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>55%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Cancer</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='45' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>45%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Capricorn</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='40' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>40%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Sagittarius</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='40' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>40%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Taurus</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='35' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>35%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Virgo</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='15' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>15%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=4079'>What sign of the Zodiac are you meant for?</a><br><font face='Arial' size='1'>created with <a href='http://quizfarm.com'>QuizFarm.com</a></font></table>"

"event","Feeling a little down today. Down and downhearted. Sometimes, you realise that the friendship someone is giving can never be the friendship you want it to be. And a friendship like that will just keep on pulling you down and causing pain unless you change your wishes or turn your back on it and let go. The former is impossible to do, which leaves the latter. I don't really believe in the concept of friendship for life anyway. There are different levels of friendship, but when you are caught inbetween those levels, neither moving closer or moving further apart from someone, it is just far too uncomfortable and futile. You want certain elements of friendship that they aren't willing to give, you either just accept that and be happy for what you have or you move on. The former just doesn't work for me. 

Anyway, everyone has long ago posted their first entry, and here I am at almost 7.30pm here, just getting started. I really should be doing some work, but I am still sleep ridden...and worse still, can't think of anything else to say! Grr."

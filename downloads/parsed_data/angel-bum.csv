"event","Alot has happend since last time I wrote.  My baby has been taken to a better place.  It's been a couple weeks now.  We put him to rest on August 6th, 2005.  I still can't believe he's gone.  I miss him so much.  I hope he comes to me in my dreams.  I can still hear him getting up on the bed.  I can feel what it was like to rub his ears and big butt.  I love you Chester.  I hope you really are in a better place like they say.  I can't wait to see you again.  Tim said he was suffering.  I just wanted to be selfish and keep him as long as I could.  I wouldn't have choosen to put him down.  I didn't want to put Gopher down either.  I still feel guilty about taking his life.  Do you think in the ""eyes from above"" that putting your dog to sleep is taking his life?  I just think that when he was ready to go that he would.  Again, maybe I'm just selfish.  

We have a new puppy ""Charlie"".  My Mom always said if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.  I'll tell you more about him later.  Kidding, he's not that bad.  I just have to remember he's still a puppy. :)

Soooooo.  I quit that bastard place Kinkos!  No more getting yelled at everyday!!!  I can't believe I put up with that shit for so long.  I am not a waitress and not a retail associate or manager!  Finally, ahhhh.  I can tell myself that I have infact tried and I now respect those who have the shitty jobs alot more.  I'm trying my hand at real estate.  Right now, I'm working as a booking agent for Belloise Realty.  Sal Belloise helped me close on my house in March '04.  He mentioned that I should consider real estate back then.  So here I am a year and a half later trying.  We'll see.

Talk to ya later
Hey Lisa, hold up your end of the bargain...

"event","Hola.
I'm not sure where I last left off.
We're in the new house now.  It's really coming along.  I just got back from training in Orlando.  It was nice.  Met some cool people and didn't get yelled at for a whole week. *smirk*  I really missed my love though.  I must have drove him crazy with all my phonecalls.  Yep.  Still happy and in love.  I guess it really is true: It's better to have loved and lost...So, he painted most of the kitchen while I was away.  I drove straight to Frenchy's as soon as I got back into town.  After a little while, it dawned on me- If I go home now, I'll just pass out and not get to see Tim.  So, like a good little lush, I decided to stay all night until Tim got off.  We went over to the Beach Bar where our friends were playing.  Then came home- to my drunk surprise- to see a freshly painted kitchen.  *big warm smile*
I hope these posts stay on here for awhile.  I'd really like to look back at them and see at what point in my life I'm at.  I think I'm going to copy these into my computer- just in case.
Did I mention that I'm devouring a celery stock and a brick of Philadelphia Cream Cheese?  Man!  Gotta love that dairy.  I'm really starting to miss Minnesota.  I miss my sister and parents.  I also miss familiar territory.  Everything is still pretty new down here.  I've been so uprooted for a long time- it seams.  
Tim should be coming home soon.
Funny how cream cheese reminded me of Minnesota.
Anyway, enough mind traveling, time to be lazy in front of the TV and snuggle with the wog until his daddy comes home.
Seez ya la'ta!"

"event","Wow, I don't even remember what was happening last time I wrote.  Well, tomorrow is the big day.  Tim and I are closing on our house.  I'm really nervous.  Things are half-packed and the people aren't even out of our new house yet.  I just hope they don't leave us a big mess to clean up.  I'm going to miss our little place.  Things have really been sinking into place the last few days.  I'm sad in a way.  We've shared so much here.  I'm going to HomeDepot tomorrow to get cleaning supplies.  That is what I'll be doing tomorrow night.  Cleaning.  We'll hopefully start painting on Friday.  We have an appointment on Friday at 1:00p to have the downstairs measured for carpet.  I have the next three days off then I work on Sunday and have Monday and Tues off again.  So, I should have time to get things ready before we move in.  Tim works at night on Thurs, Fri and Sat.  It doesn't make much sense for him to take time off during spring break.  This is when he makes most of his money.  So a week off would really hurt us right now.  Well, I wouldn't say hurt us necessarily but it definitely helps that he is working.  
  Our bedroom set is being delivered on the 8th.  Tim's mom and her husband, Bonnie and Barry, bought it for us.  We still need sheets and stuff though.  We are also looking at a matching livingroom set for $1500.  They're having a ""no interest for three years"" deal right now.  It goes through the 29th so we still have some time to get it still.  We need to have it delivered after the carpet gets in though.
  I just got done working an 15&1/2 hour day.  Got there at 6am and left at 9:30p.  I am pooped.  Well, off to my shower.  Been working so much and packing... well let's just say I haven't seen the inside of it in a while.  Soapy Soapy.
Goodnight, Sleep Tight."

"event","So, I'm writing a cover letter, for a resume, that my boss asked about.  I'm getting better at writing.  Thanks to my sister and mom.  I read a woman's introduction the other day at work and the only thing I could think of was 'technically that is not a sentence, it's a fragment and you really should have thought of a better word then happy'.
I know, I'm not the best, but I may be getting paid more soon.
I really want to quit my other job but I just make too much money.  Maybe I should have been a stripper.  Maybe last year, ten pounds ago.
Ok, got to get back to my future."

"event","So, I've been getting sick for about a week.  I think I'll be able to kick it without antibiotics.  Tim says he helped boost my immune system.  Cuz he makes put things into my body that aren't exactly the cleanest or purest.  Don't take that wrong.  Like eating yogurt that is slightly past the due date or bread that just might have some mold on it.  So I think I'm getting a digital camera from work.  We passed our goals for the last quarter so each of us gets a MP3 player or camera.  Yeah Me!!  I can also print them out at work or save them for emailing.  *Ear to Ear Grin*
Tim and I are still looking for a house.  We are at least getting closer to finding what we're looking for.  Hopefully when I get my tax check back it will help pull me out of debt.
I really want to quit my second job but I just make too much money.  I make more then my day job in half the time.  Uugh.  Ah well.  At least I'm not stripping or something.  
Oh and some asshole pissed me off at work today.  I charged him for full service and he said he did it himself.  So he said, ""nice try though"".  Nice hugh?!  So I gave him a evil die look and he said, ""don't be snotty with me"".  So I set down his credit card and just walked away.  AssMonkey.  I thought of all these cool things I could've said, of course after the fact.  Then when I was exiting work, a big blazer cut me off- he was making a left turn from across the street and I a right.  So he speeds up just as I'm turning and cuts into my lane!  Almost hitting me.  Uugh.  I'm sorry but there are so many assholes in the world, I'm suprised we haven't blown ourselves up yet.  And frankly I won't be surprised when we do.  
Love you Leese.
Blow that snaz of yours!  Sleep tight...

"event","Well, I paid off some of my car loan.  Soon I'll be out of debt.  That's really cool.  I'm getting sick though.  That's not so cool.  I called Saltwater and got one of my shifts picked up.  I'm supposed to work two doubles in a row the next two days.  Not the best plan when you're getting sick.  I put some picts up.  They're of my dog though.  I couldn't find any of me that I liked.  So, I put one up of Tim and I.  I love Tim.  Did I mention that yet?
Ya know what's really strange?  I never heard Nirvana in Minnesota like I do down here.  They play it like it's a new band with constantly hit songs.  It's like every other song.  I'm not kidding.  I really hear it every other song sometimes.  Not that I don't appreciate that they changed and helped the direction of music.
Ugh, what else.  Oh, did I mention that Tim cut up the boat?  He took a saw to it and drug it across the street to the ghetto-pick-up pile.  We don't give things to the thrift store anymore.  We just set it on the curb and within minutes someone comes to claim it.  Well, something is better than nothing.  Right?  Isn't that something like how it goes?  One persons trash is another one's treasure?
So goodnight, I'm up at 6:30a tomorrow.

Tim is tearing apart the boat right now.  He says it's rotten and needs to be replaced.  It was good for a first boat.  I'm glad he wants another one.  We have alot of fun and spend alot of time on the water.

I've only soddered stained glass pices before.  We'll see.  A gentleman has been trying to get me into working with him on a short film that they give out to schools and libraries.  It's just that I don't have time and it's not going to lead anywhere that I would like to go.  I'm content at my job(s) and where am I even going to fit in an apprentiship?  My parents are coming down in a couple weeks.
Still looking for a house.  Still contemplating moving to Holiday.  Not sure yet though.
Time to go lay on the couch with Chester and try not to eat cheese."

"event","Sometimes I'll be driving to work, trying to ignore all the 200 year old drivers, and I think of these cool things that I would like to write in my journal.  But when I actually get home and hop on my computer, I can't think of shit.
My friend was in a serious car accident on NYE.  He was coming to hang out with me @ the beach.  He had called to let me know he was on his way, but I never heard back from him.  When I realized what time it was, the party was over.  So, I didn't bother calling him back.  Thankfully everyone is ok.  A few broken here, a few bruises there.  The car is totaled though.  A sober friend was driving the car.  And guess what happened!?  A 200 year old woman blew a red light and hit them head on!!  Yes, they are all at least that old down here.  Oh, and yes, head on also.  FL passed a new law that everyone over 80 has to take a driving test.  What the hell are 80 year olds driving for anyway?  Shouldn't they use those new turbo scooters or something?  That's an idea!  I'm going to invent the scooter express way.  Then they can crash into each other instead of my friends.  Assholes.  I'm sorry, but come on.  Have some respect for other drivers.  Oh and a note to my sister: Yes, I know, not everyone can be as good of drivers as us.  Tim's pretty good too though.
Good bye and good night.  Have to prep for my 6:30 wake up call.  Tim will probably want me to get up earlier then that.  Which I probably should."

"event","I battled many fierce White Russians last night.  They came at me in a gang and abused my mental state of mind.  Tim and I got large jugs, yes jugs- I'm an alcoholic just like the rest of my family- of generic vodka and coffee liqueur and made drinks all night.  We took two walks with Chester (we're getting the mid-winter beer bellies).  Tim made the most delicious dinner, cajun seasoned fish and shrimp over yellow rice with a cajun cream sauce.  I um, supervised.  He worked in a kitchen for quite a few years, in some really delicious restaurants.  Boy, did I get lucky or what?!
I dropped Tim off at Rockaway for work and stopped over at Saltwater to talk to Karen, the manager.  She scheduled me four shifts next week.  Two days and two nights for training.  Kinko's changed my hours to 7:30 - 3:30 so that I'm able to work another job and hopefully get a higher position.  I would like to work 3/4 shifts a week at Saltwater, we'll see how that goes.  I really don't want to burn myself out or get stressed.  No one around me appreciates me getting stressed.  Especially Tim.  
Did I mention he's the love of my life?  I'm not sure that I did.  I'll put some pictures up one of these days.  Tim and I met at Rockaway when I was hosting and he bar-backing - I was just a year or so out of high school.  I was in a ltr at the time that taught me a lot about what I didn't want in a partner.  I returned to Minnesota for two years and acquired a degree in animation.  Then returning to Florida (with the other) I started working with Tim again.  One of my managers told me that his attitude started changing when he heard I was coming back.  I little bounce in his step, if you will.  Within a couple weeks I had broken up (for a second time) with the other and started hanging out with Tim everyday.  We started our relationship by getting fun cards at Busch Gardens.  We went there a lot the first year.  Tim also used to take me out on his canoe and we would find a secluded nook in the mangroves and lay out in the sun naked.  I(t) was really a good time but unfortunately Tim's arms always got tired.  Again, I supervised.  That's my job, I sit there and look cute.  Tim likes to be in control and take care of me.  Come on, admit it, you're jealous.  A beautiful man, who cooks, paddles and loves me, I couldn't ask for anything else.
The three of us (Tim, Chester and I) are looking to buy a house within the next couple of months.  We can either get a 3/2 with a large screened pool in bfe or a 2/1 with no pool close to the beach and where we work.  Huummm, ghetto or bfe?  House hunting blows goats.  My sister has a friend that looks like a goat.  Or at least that's the picture he put up.  I would be really disappointed to find out he falsified his picture to pick up chicks or something.  *slight chuckle at my humorous self*
Alright, enough for now.  Hope all goes alright around the globe tonight.  I'll be with the one I love tonight.  I hope I have many more New Years Eves with him."

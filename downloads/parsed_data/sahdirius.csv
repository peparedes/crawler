"event","Haha.. ha. Another morning of giving sermons on Reincarnational Relationships and Probable Realities to my Vampire God Within Order. Which seems to have gotten noticed within the community online. Hmmmm, I am making some pretty cool connections and building my kingdom I guess. Bla bla bla... I am bored.

My phone has been shut off and I have been too lazy to turn it back on so things have been awefully quite in my phone circle... sorry if you have tried to call. I'm totally online now when it comes to any contact at all... Hmmm. maybe I can be re-inserted into the matrix and forget about the outside world. Hahaha."

"event","This morning I started off shopping in the Rivermarket here in Little Rock. Got some 7 grain bread, picked up some breakfast. Then browsed the merchants section. I noticed a booth with some nice stuff. Hmmm... precious items... My eyes crossed two items. One was way to expensive but very impressive. Then I browsed across a few more items. He was in the middle of unpacking the rest of his marchandise when he said... ""wait a second... let me show you this piece..."" he then pulled out a remarkable authentic item made of quality craftsmanship and precious materials. He made me a reasonable deal. As I peered into my reflection I thought of a new friend of mine. He mentioned that he should give me a receipt just in case... And I said ""Yes sir.. It will be needed to make it through customs!"" He marked a lower price than what I paid so that it would get through faster.

Now I am preparing a Sermon for my Y-Group. Showing some IMAX movies to the field trip kids from the local schools. And as soon as I get off work I am Express Mailing a good friend of mine a suprise gift. Just wish I was there to see her beautiful face when she sees it for the first time!"

"event","Well I mixed my Zoloft with Bud Light this weekend. Lets just say I put on my cape when I went out and tried to make a scene in the bar I used to run. Some lady asked to see my teeth... I told her that I used to do a bunch of meth and it ate them down! I wrapped my cape around my old boss and told him to try Zoloft and flew away to the other side of the bar where I told my old friend Sultana (her vampire name) who was waiting on me that the food sucked and so did her service... I wanted her to ""serve me"" hahahaha. I did everything I could to get them to kick me out... but it was impossible! Hell they wouldn't even fire me when I worked there. Seems I have free reign on the only riverboat here in little rock, ar. The rest of my weekend was slow and lame... I miss my friend Heidi-Rose from London, wish we had more time to talk baby!"

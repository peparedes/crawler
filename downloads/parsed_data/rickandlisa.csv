BUT THEY DIDN'T, sorry russell!

krista had homecoming, and she looked awesome. Todd (her date) looked great too.  after the dance they went to see the movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre... she said it was just okay. so now i'll wait for the video.

rick worked the fair all weekend and i worked my tail off at work all weekend. tomorrow is a well deserved day off for me. HOWEVER, i'll probably still go in and work on truck order and schedules.

new idea, thinking i want to put ceramic tile throughout my house.. but i want it done in next couple of weeks. going tomorrow to look at tile, and putting the word out for tilers.  oh, whole house EXCEPT bedrooms.

"event","Hey, I'm baaackkkkk. well, i've been back since monday from talladega, but i went straight to work that day and closed, woke up tuesday, went to work till late last nite, and had to be back at work at 5 a.m. this morning, till a little bit ago. WOW, this GM stuff, is tiring. BUT.. i am determined to do a good job. i'm not actually the GM so to speak,( i am the *acting* GM) BUT, i am the only one there. The GM we had, was sent to another store, cuz it's all messed up. so at my store is me, a new mgr, a new mgr, and a shift leader. so i guess, i am training myself to be a GM. so, i am SKEERED!!! just don't want to mess up!!!! but i'm enjoying it!!! 

so, talladega? wooohoooo!!! awesome weekend. rusty ran a great race!!! that man of mine!!! and of course, i went shopping.. i bought a pajama outfit and wore it around the campsite all day saturday. (rick goes, you are wearing PAJAMAS all over the campground)i said, (it's a campground and they are RUSTY'S pajamas), then i bought a pair of shorts with RUSTY WALLACE on the rear. liked them soooooo much (having rusty all over my butt)i went and bought ANOTHER pair!!! oh YEAH.. rusty on my rear!!!! and of course the little stuff, 2 shirts, key chains, 2 antenna toppers for the car, ummm
i don't remember everything, lets just say, it was $300 well spent!!!!!!!

well, enuf of that.. the kids are great!! (oh, wait, while we were there, found out my nephew was there, we got to meet up and spend a few minutes together before the race,YIPPEEEE, WOOHHOOOO.) it was a freak thing that he was there, so i was excited.. hope he was..!!

ok, now, enuf of that... krista has now decided that this guy she went to homecoming last year with (as friends) that has been BEGGING her to be *dating*, and she has put him off and just wanted to be friends with (they hang out all the time, and have an awesome time, but she just doesn't want to be his girlfriend, cuz they are toooo good of best friends)she has decided, to try the dating thing.. he's a good guy, and comes from a good family. WOW, this could be a true boyfriend. 

my daughter is almost 18 and has only had one guy that she has even went on a date with. i'm soooo PROUD!!! so, i will back her. i know he really likes her, cuz he's been there for her BEGGING to date her. they hang out all the time. they didn't talk for a while, cuz he told her that it hurt to much.  awwww, sounds like a nice guy!!!

christopher is doing great!! i've worked sooo much since i've been back from talladega, i just saw him for the first time 10 minutes ago. you know what he said? 
hey, mom, can i have this ice cream?

well, i'm done blabbering.. will run for now.. have to go do MIT schedules, mgr schedule, truck order, sales projections and other tid bits........

work went fine, boy, i'll tell you. GM's deserve more credit!!! i am finding that i have NO time to think of ANYTHING but sales, labor, time, controllables, cleaning, employees, and everything else that the future of your restaurant depends on.  i am happy to be acting GM and learning it all, though. and teresa is a great teacher. there are some major changes coming, and i'm real nervous about that, so wish me luck.  with this new position, i feel like i should be at work 24/7. 

rick worked all day on the RV. we leave for talladega thurs. nite. he's sooooo excited!!!!

christopher and krista are both doing great. krista was selected to be the *Senior Feature* in the local paper. it's a write up about her life.  i'll have 50 copies before it's all done and over.  well, that's it for now. maybe i'll write more later today....

BRING ME THE MONEY, BABY...

i worked today, donnie, our DSSP came in and did my evaluation... i am soooo happy to say i got a great grade and maybe a nice li'l raise! my co-run is going good, just real nerve racking to think that an entire restaurant is depending on me for everything. very scary!!!!! teresa hasn't totally let go yet, which is good, but she is turning most everything over. within the next month, i want to be totally dependant on myself!! but we'll see..

krista is at todd's house (a friend) watching a movie. christopher is here watching t.v., i am about to go to bed, cuz i open tomorrow... and will run home to spend time with rick tomorrow afternoon.........

anyways, we are going to tampa to visit my brother. my mom is upset that we haven't seen each other in a long while. so we are also trying to make her happy, too.  she is going down with us. so, i'm excited. i love my brother, but with our jobs, we haven't been able to visit each other.  he's all excited and probably will be waiting at the hotel for us.

"event","well, it's here, starting 2 hours ago, i am on vacation.. i say 2 hours ago, cuz i had an 8 a.m. meeting till 1 then we went on our canoe trip (still work, but FUN) i got home about 5, so with rick, i can now start vacation.

canoe trip, let's talk about that.. OUCH, who was there, DSSP'S darwin and donny.. GM's chad (krista's boss at pine forest), mark, and eric... and the rest of us.. BILLY was there, my billy.. he was an MIT at our store that he and i bonded with at first site.. if we both weren't married,,hmmmmm.. just kidding.. we have a great relationship. however, all day, and i do mean all day, he kept professing his love for me... but he did save my belongings several times, cuz i took a KAYAK, (we all did) and i've never done a kayak, it was fun, but very easy to tip. yes, you heard it from me. i tipped myself 2 times, and that dang darwin and chad got me 3 more.. so i stayed wet. darwin was just in a tipping mood. oh, and billy got DRUNK, let's just say, i'm glad he wasn't driving. but i love 'em.

anyways, we go tubing many times over the summer, we are pros, right... well, lisa NEVER jumps from the tree rope (on the creek) i have never done it and said i would never do it.. well, they talked me into it and i did... all was great till i let go, and somehow i ripped the skin beneath my fingernail, and just noticed that my right hand ring finger is swollen, so i think i jammed it.. it HURTS.. both of them. even typing is painful. so will lisa ever jump from the tree rope again????? hmmmm... rick's not happy.. sad that he for the 3rd day sat home alone, and i did the rope.
well, that's all done, we had a great time, next meeting, donny was saying we're going to go paintballing, OH YEAH.. i'll send christopher in my place. one good thing, i'll show up like a pro, cuz when christopher went thru that phase, i had to buy him EVERYTHING, and all good quality. so, i'll look great.

we are throwing ideas up for our time together, tomorrow, we need to go tubing cuz i did lose my rusty shirt from talladega that i loved so much, on one of my tip overs. and rick WILL find it, he won't leave till i have it back.  then he mentioned he wants to go to biloxi (ugh, we just lose money), and he wants to take me deep sea fishing (he loves that and i've never been).  but, we'll see.. i am off till sept. 6th, and will miss everyone.  keith, i owe him ruby bux. the guy knows how to win my heart (read his comment).

well, off and about, better go visit with rick, he just came in here and gave me a hugand kiss and said he's missed me the last 3 days,,,,and i'm on the puter.....awwwwww...

what are we doing?? your guess is as good as mine, HOWEVER, we did come up with a *whim* idea. a cruise. hmmmm, still thinking about it. we wanna do it, but i'm nervous. that's a big *whim*, but we'll see.. the way i see it, we'll probably be sitting around this house and painting and landscaping.

ummm, krista is doing great!! she is capt of awareness team, and capt of the swim team!!! yeah!!! i just want this year to be her best!!!!she got her class ring, looks great. 

christopher, as much as he loves football, is probably going to quit.. UGH.. reason? he can't be mean, yes, that's why... he WON'T hit hard, afraid he'll hurt someone... now i know i raised my baby to be a good boy.. but DANG.. i wanted him to play football.  so, i told him to look for something we will enjoy.  besides, everyday, he comes home and sleeps after practice. oh well, as long as my kids are happy that's all i want.

NOTHING much. just work and sleep, work and sleep. i'm off tuesday.  i don't remember if i said this yet, but krista is twirling in the half time show at the Liberty Bowl in Memphis on new year's eve. she's really happy. hmmm, wonder who'll play? 

christopher went yesterday and had football pictures taken. YES, i was the ONLY mom with her own camera taking tons of pictures. hope i didn't embarrass him to bad. but i've taken pictures of my babies since they came out. TONS OF PICTURES. we are going to get the team pic., 8x10 of him, a mouse pad, a coffee cup, 2 buttons, pennant, and a t-shirt. (proud mama)  i actually want to figure out HOW to put krista's senior pic and christopher's football pic on same mouse pad, hmmmmmm,

laurie's (another mgr at work) last day is tomorrow. she's moving to indiana. 

vacation is only 9 days away!!! oh, next monday, we have a regional mgr. meeting, we are going canoeing afterwards, i hate going without rick, so i'll be bored. rick will be at home cuz of our vacation. so i know i'll be rushing the day along.  

about vacation, hmmm, we are just going to spend time together and camping on that next weekend with the kids. i now think christopher's first game is the 28th of aug., and it's in Choctaw, and i do think that's near ft. walton beach, sooooo, ft. walton may be a nice place to go camping for the weekend.. have to talk to rick about it. 

other ideas were rick and me doing a trip to biloxi for a day, us two running to tampa for a couple of days and doing the busch gardens thing, (i'd get to see chris (my brother)) so that sounds kewl, and i'd like to spend 2 or 3 days finishing the painting on the house (ricks not thrilled with that) we have from sunday 24th (if i get that off) to sept 1st (for rick) and the 2nd (for me). oh, and our 18th anniversary is the 3rd!!!! woohoo.. 18!!!! 

oh, rick went out last nite and got his birthday present (from april) he got him a new deep sea fishing rod, he LOVES it!!!! went fishing today, but got rained out early. 

well, i guess that's it for now,

here's what's going on right now. krista is now a senior (oh, my golly gee willakers) i am sooo depressed that my baby is a senior. HOWEVER, i am very proud of her, don't get me wrong. i just hate to see her getting ready to leave me. this whole year, i'll need lots of TLC. senior pictures we just did, oh my, did she look great. wanna see? let me know, i'll email them to ya. 

right now, she is trying out for swim team, think she'll be fine, she's been on team for 3 years now. she cut her hair off to shoulders, looks great.

christopher, FRESHMAN, god i'm old... my ""main"" man is now in high school. on the football team at that. he LOVES it.  doesn't care for the schooling part of it, but loves football. and considering out of 4 classes he has 1 of them is football/weightlifting, he can't complain.

rick is great, of course, still my bundle of love.

i, am doing fine, just working. we have vacation coming, and YES, we still don't know what we are doing. first time ever we've been this crazy. we have always been well prepared for vacation. i just see rick and me fiddling around milton/pensacola for 2 days, laying around house for 3, and going camping with kids for 2. but we'll see.

christopher is still at james'... i miss him...

oh, giving krista and christopher $300 each to go school shopping. enough, i wonder? we'll see and go from there. i know that krista wants a $50 back pack, so hers won't go far. and christopher always has to have $90 shoes, so nope, probably not enough. but we'll see.

vacation?? who knows, so confused about that. christopher's football, jordan's baseball, chris' job, now trying to just find maybe a weekend for everyone to meet half way between here and tampa. then us take our family vacation, but still boggled by christopher's football schedule. don't want to mess him up on high school football. speaking of christopher, my little baby left tonite for james and elizabeths for a week. UGH... i miss him already. but i hope he has fun. james has damon, and he usually takes christopher for a week at that time so they two can spend time together.

krista doing great... she's at todd's tonite (a friend)

rick and me here alone, he's watching t.v. in here (study)with me.. haven't had much time together lately, but we gotta work.

oh, new rick and lisa plan.... going to send krista off to college next year, christopher in 4 more years then he and i are going on a cruise!!!! have always wanted too, but could never or have never had the chance. so it's him and i in 4 years.. hee,hee.. 

well, gonna go play euchre on pogo, have to go to bed soon, 7:00 gets here way to fast. talk to ya tomorrow.

"event","Well, home from the santa rosa county junior miss, it was great.  Let me say, I am one proud mama, and she didn't even win the title, (i knew before going in she wouldn't get top winner cuz of her grades, but that was okay). the whole program was great, there are some talented and beautiful young women in santa rosa, i will say.  anyways, they judged them on scholastics, fitness, interview, talent and poise.  krista WON, yes i said WON the fitness award, she did great in that routine. her talent was a baton routine, and (i just re-watched it) she did AWESOME, however, she had 4 drops and they were EASY craps. she caught all of the hard stuff, so if she hadn't made silly drops, well, we'll never know, huh? the routine was great and she put some hard stuff in there.  however, she did walk away with the fitness award and a small scholorship for that, she got her entry fee paid for to enter the American Co-Ed Scholorship Pageant, and hopefully she had a great time.  The program book came out good, remember? that was the $100 to make a krista page, hee,hee. and they still charged me $2.00 to get one. you would think, when you pay the $100, you'd get one for free, GEEESH.  it was great, mom came in town and i know krista appreciated that. rachel(her best friend) was there. rachel has stuck beside her through this almost everyday!!! helping her workout and practice... rachel's mom came, that was great. and us of course.  i took lots of pictures and videoed it (duh, i video and take pictures of EVERYTHING).  if i can get one to be small enough to put on here i will, but they can only be a certain size.

now, yes, i'm off tonite and tomorrow, YIPPEEEEE. going to finish this and go visit pogo.com. maybe chris is on.

i don't know if anyone looks at my journal, and i am curious, could you leave me a comment at the bottom (Ash, i know your here babe). but i think you are the ONLY one who can sit through my DREARY life.. hee,hee.....

well, off to watch cops and play euchre

till later,

p.s. I LOVE YOU KRISTA AND SOOOO VERY PROUD OF YOU, you have turned into a wonderful, smart, beautiful, and respectful young lady. so many teenagers make the wrong choices. You should be very proud for being so set in your ways, and having the morals that you do.  In a million years, i would have never thought my children would have turned out so great. christopher, i love you and sooo proud of you and your choices. stick to your dreams as a football player, you've got mommy and daddy's support!!! i wouldn't trade one day with you 2 for anyone else in the world. i can honestly say, i don't worry about you two making choices.

k, no more mushy stuff.. they don't even read this.. lololol, but that is my feelings!!! my 2 babies are my life!!!!!

"event","Well, you know it, i'm off for the weekend, that'll never happen again. what am i doing? NOTHING.. rick went tubing with christopher, i didn't go, cuz tonite is the santa rosa county junior miss and i didn't want to be out in the hot weather, nasty water and then try and make it to that. and rick planned the tubing trip while forgetting about tonite. so anyways, i am okay with a day of leisure, tv, and being alone. mom should be in town about 2:00, maybe we'll go out to dinner before tonite.

work has been fine, i was ready for a day off, been since last saturday that i've had one. then when i go back monday, won't have another till NEXT monday. it's terrible going 7 days without time off, but it's okay, i'm sure i'll survive.

paid bills last nite, might i say, that i am very excited about the thought of paying all of my bills off and being debt free by December 2005, and let me tell you, i have ALOT of debt!!! trump couldn't afford my debt!!!!! i will have all my little credit cards and my car paid off this year. then next year, i plan on paying off my bigger credit cards and RV, then 2005 pay off my BIG loan!!! i can't wait!

yup, tonites the nite. i hope krista does well, for her sake. i don't care if she wins, cuz she's always a winner with me and daddy.  but she has worked for 2 months on this, rehearsal after rehearsal.  going to school to practice on her own time, etc.  i know she WON'T walk away with title of Junior Miss, cuz of her grades, but i would like for her to do something.  oh CRAP, have to charge camera and cam corder batteries... ok, got them charging... now, what the heck am i going to wear?? 

woohoo, tomorrow the race and i'm home!!! on a sunday even!! 2 races in a row i've gotten to watch. probably will be the last too, but that's okay!! 

Big Brother is going great, me being up late, i get to see them active on the computer in live feeds from the house.

well, have to go make banners for tonite, don't know what i'll make, but i am going to make some for us to hold up.

OH, how i've been waiting to see it.. last nite was first show. 

krista is getting closer to santa rosa junior miss, she's nervous.

oh, bought some marble flooring for kids bathroom the other day, don't know when we'll (rick) will put it in, but i do have it. i want to pick up more for our bathroom, so i'll do that in next day or 2.  also, need to buy paint, for our room. i wanna get that done.  my whole plan is to have entire house painted and mostly ceramic tiled by end of the year.  now, the problem with that is, getting me off my butt to paint and ricks to tile....

well, haven't heard anything or replies from family members on vacation, so, i'm talking to rick tonite about alternative plans for the 4 of us.  i'm nervous about taking christopher out of school for a week, just cuz of football. it's not like peewee stuff, it's high school, and his coach didn't sound to happy when christopher mentioned to him being gone for a week. and i don't want to mess that up for him.
so we'll talk tonite.  

dorothy should be back friday from visiting nancy, hope she had a good time.

oh, visited aprons on ebay... (for the kitchen days) and yes, a RUSTY one.. woohoo, bids end in 2 hours and i'm watching it.. that apron is soooooo mine!!!! you'll see.....


my dilemma, do i pay $30 to watch BB4 all the time on computer (live feeds) knowing i won't get to watch it alot cuz of work. hmmmm, who am i kidding, i know i'll do it, and be mad, cuz i wasted more money. i'm signing up right after we watch it from last nite, if i buy it now, i'll watch it now and i don't want to ruin the 1st show for me, oh heck.... GOING TO SIGN UP FOR IT RIGHT NOW... yippee!!!!! gonna watch BB4 on computer.....

I tasted them, and ummmm walmart's pretzels are better.  He said Nu uh, then I just said, of course you are going to like them, you don't want to say you spent money and waited for pretzels like a little tike, that you didn't end up liking, cuz i'd laugh at you.. hee,hee.  But he's proud of them, so i'm happy for him and his pretzels.

"event","It has been such a shitty week. When I got home today there was a message waiting for me on AIM. It's from this kid John, whom I've been damn good friends with for quite some time. He says to me something along the lines of, ""Don't talk to me again, hopefully I'll never see you or many other people ever again.""    Doesn't give me a reason...doesn't give me anything. Josh and Kathy...please don't say anything to me about this, it isn't that I don't respect your opinions or (Kathy's) feelings. (Josh has none) But you know that I actually DID consider him a friend.

This really ruined my fucking day. I think I wouldn't have had as much of a problem with it if he had given me a reason, because I honestly have NO IDEA what the FUCK I did. Needless to say, I'm angry. I just got back from coffee, and the whole time I was praying for some idiotfuck to give me a reason to stab him (or her) repeatedly in the neck and face area. But Tool heals all wounds...so now I'm slowly becoming just generally angry, instead of angry at a certain thing."

"event","Sunday sucked...it was the first sunday i've had off in about a year, and i pretty much did nothing. I was supposed to hang out with Aubra and Emma, but they never called me, so that sucked. Then i told Sean i'd do something with him, cuz he was all depressed, but i ended up getting into a big fight with my mother, so that sort of scratched the whole ""going out"" thing off of my list...i mean, i could've gone out, but i don't want to get kicked out onto the street. 

I think i've decided not to go back to school next semester, seeing as how i have no money to pay for it. I figure i'll just work full time and save up cash so's i can get mah learn on next year. I'm thinking about moving out...Em says that i can go live with her, but i'd need to get a car first...and i'm not sure...i don't want to turn into Corey the Perpetually Stoned Idiot Boy. But it'd still be nice to get away from this fucking house for a bit."

"event","I feel so disgustingly childish and pathetic right now...I haven't been letting things get to me for so long, and especially anything involving women, because I know (or at least believe) that there's really nothing I can do about it. So far it has worked amazingly well...and I've been alone and relatively happy for two years, after going through two years of being alone and feeling sorry for myself. I thought that I had gotten used to being super-pletonic Corey, but I suppose that all it took was someone I was honestly attracted to. Her and I were out having coffee tonight, (and don't get me wrong, we had talked about it, and I already knew that she didn't feel the same about me in anyway that i felt about her) and she gets a phone call. So she looks at her phone, sees who it is, and answers it, ""Hello my love."" It's this guy Bob that i've known for quite a long time from therapy. He's a really great guy, and if i didn't have feelings for this girl i would want her to be with a guy like him. So they talk...or just flirt, i tried not to pay attention. But it really upset me, and i feel like an ass because of it...it's like i'm fucking 14 again, and i don't want to go back to being self-pitying and depressed over stupid fucking shit that i can't change at all...i don't know what to do about it, though..."

"event","You know...after taking a look at some other people's journals, I really felt bad about not keeping up with mine... Sure, between 20 hours of school and 35 hours of work a week, as well as about 20 hours of sleep and 15 hours of trying so very hard (and, recently, failing) to write, it doesn't leave me with much time, but I still feel like I'm abandoning my poor, weak and tiny journal to the ravages of the harsh internet. (I can't believe I just wrote that, but I am too tired to reach for the delete key. Kill me soon.) So I'm going to try to write more. I know you care, because I'm just so irresistably talented. And I most assuredly do not indulge in self-worship.

Thank the lord, I got an 80 on my photography midterm, while most of the class failed...which isn't really saying much, considering I go to high school 2... praise me."

"event","Have any of you ever met one of those types of people that should be legally and physically constrained to their house? I met one today. My boss calls her ""The cat lady."" Dear CHRIST she is one of the most foul-smelling, disgusting excuses for a person I have ever met. She REEKS of cat piss. And I mean that when I'm in the back of the store, I can SMELL when she walks in. I almost threw up 8 or 9 times and my boss had to step outside; it's that unbearable.

Do you people now understand WHY I need a license to kill? Do you understand why I want one? How could someone not NOTICE that the people around them gag uncontrollably? Sweet whorish mother of merciless God!

"event","Going to the RenFaire this weekend. Fuck you, I know, I'm a dork, blah blah blah die. I'm hoping it'll be fun but it's supposed to rain so this may just be an experience to enrage me further. 


Sometimes I'm really glad that I don't drive. It seems to me that on the way to DC3 every morning, people have been doing increasingly stupid things with their cars. Little Bill and I have decided that when I get a car, I need to have a loudspeaker on it so I can shout things at people like, ""Look at you, what the hell do you think you're doing?"" and, ""Oh my god that was one of the stupidest things I've ever seen, you idiot."" Personally I like the idea, it'll give me endless hours of entertainment and possibly a bullet or two in my face.


Someone's PREGNANT!!!!!!! But I can't tell you who...hehehe...it's a secret....a hilarious secret."

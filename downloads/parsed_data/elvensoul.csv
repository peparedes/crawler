2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you
    feel irresistable is straight-forward, just tell you he/she
    loves you.

3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is stylish.

4.  What you hate most in your partner is that the person is
    ruthless, cold-blooded, and/or ironic.

5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your
    partner is one that you care not only about the present but
    also the future with your partner, a long-lasting relationship
    that you can grow with.

6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything
    wrong after marriage.

7.  You always want to get married, but in fact, you don't even know

I don't know what he/she is..orc? human? elf? dwarf?  but see everybody except for the humans know better than to linger around the house of an elf.  although i am not armed because Wind Song is unstrung, i do not need the use of weapons to bring down this human.  i would have troubles if it were a man from the westernese but that is not likely for they have great respect for elves.  this human mocks me for he left foot prints in the snow and he thinks that  an elf would not notice.  it's time to set up a watch for the night and bring this foe to his/her fate.  the tracks were about 7 hours old so that means that there is a possibility that this foe was watching me when i was playing on the computer...starcraft takes all my attention away and numbs my other senses for all of my attention is focused on it.  hmmm, i wish that he/she would try that again, i won't let him get away the second time.

"event","Ah, well today was nice.  Half day and I got to park there, hehe it was quite close so that was really interesting because it felt good to not walk a quarter mile to get to your car...haha!  Hmmm the boys came over for lunch, I cooked some dumplings and some other thangs...seems like they enjoyed it because it was all gone.  Then Me, Papi, Wang, and Eric headed to the bang where we kinda owned in Counterstrike.  There were a lot of people there...haha it was quite interesting but fun.  Then we left around 4 and went back to my house.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that we ate over hub wires that connected his labtop to my comp...well we never established a connection but I took a picture of what a gamer's lunch would look like but my stupid ass sister deleted the pics from the camera...grrr.  Damn that was tight cuz the food was like around the wires and stuff hahaha! Gaming till the day we die...hmmm so yeah, we went back to my house, had really nice convos and played some chess.  I think that's going to be the new past time...chess playing.  So then they left and my mom came and bitched at my sisters because of their grades and I feel it too when I get my card tomorrow =D.  *sigh* Papi is feeling it man...the feeling that I've had for a month when I didn't do homework...hehe say congrats to him for he allied with UMCP =D. Ok, typing correct hurts my damn hands, Gg.

This weekend wasn't that bad, we didn't have school on Friday so hmmm...what did I do on Friday?  Oh yeah!  I went to Wang's house and shoveled his car out, he came out and was like "" What are you doing?! ""  Hahaha Papi and I were gming him so it was good, then we went to my house to eat then dropped my grandfather off.  After that, BANG!  hehehe, then we went home, I went to volleyball to find out that nobody was there so I'm like hmmm, this is bm.  I went to Papi's house and decided to go buy a burner.  Damn you, I love that car.  It's like oh shiet, we only have 15 min to get to Circuit City! Let's goooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!  Haha we were like going 70 constant on university, pressed the turbo button and we have lift off! LoL, hmmm well we found really bm ones so he was like "" Let's go to Best Buy! "" HUK!! Hmmm, driving fast is addicting, reminds me of back in the day but I had to yanno?  We get to Best Buy on the Pike in 14 min not using the beltway...hmmm...you may have to excuse this bm.  So bought a burner and he stayed here till 11 trying to manner my comp...but it didn't wanna be mannered.

Saturday, hmmm...went to Jen's house at 1...left at 6:30! lol, I was there for quite a while, watched EVERY EPISODE of American Gaydols...whew!  I don't think I've ever stayed in her house for that long.  So that was great...then I went to Papi's house to get him again cuz I can't get enough of him.  Did stuff...then banged to sleep.

Sunday, worked from 9-12 then SCED my ass off! Time to go to school now!  Well today's monday so bye bye...and Ms. Aidan, if you're reading this, I'm sorry again... =(

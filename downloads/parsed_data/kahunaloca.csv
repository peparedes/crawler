"event","Welcome. Glad to see you. Pull up a chair or pick a comfy cushion. There's plenty to go around, and a space just for you. Fresh pot of tea steeping (or a cuppa joe, if you like). Come on in and sit down a spell. Catch your breath. Take a look-see.

This is a safe place to tell stories, plop down random (or not-so-random) thoughts, and spill out your rant du jour. P.O.-ed as heck? Something tickle your funny bone? Something weird happen? Go ahead and share. Love to hear it. We're listening.

<lj-cut text=""Hey, there! Click here to read more ..."">We're here to hang loose and let loose. Schmooze. Spit Fire. Whatever comes to the surface. Now's your chance. Who knows what might come out? Maybe it will be a story about a patient, your dream from last night, or something you overheard in the office/clinic/hospital/bathroom stall. Maybe it's a poem or a quotation that stuck to your mind like gum on your shoe. Well, peel it off and stick it down here.

Once upon a residency, my cohort of residents (re: ""gang"") used to meet during Friday lunchtime. For three years, we met inside that immobile mobile trailer. Maybe the walls were made out of tin, but as a shelter, it felt strong, the support -- even stronger. It was a place to be still or let spill. We could stay light or go deep. No pressure either way. We shared more nutritional than lunches. We shared stories. 

Since those meetings, it's been more than ten years. There's been a lot of water under the bridge, a lot of stories building up. This is continuation of that sharing ... Basically, this is an on-line version of the <i>Finding Meaning in Medicine</i> groups, inspired by Rachel Remen's work (see below). In these groups, docs have been meeting monthly and sharing stories about themselves and their patients. You could consider this a drive-by modern life version. Frankly, I don't have the time to go to regular meetings, but I can squeeze out a few minutes here and there to post a little story. Hopefully, this will interest you, and you can too.

Just pretend this is a limitless no-host potluck. Everyone brings different munchies. Everyone gets to nibble and digest at their own leisure. No one has to clean up. You can come and go as you like whenever you like. The doors are open 24/7. The only timeframe is your own.

You do this by setting up your own web log. A web log (or ""blog"") is through LiveJournal. There are other medical blogs on other websites, but LiveJournal is still free, easy to use, and can be made secure so that no one but you and members of this group can read your entries. In general, this will *not* be open to public reading unless you choose to let only your entries be public. Other members (like myself!) may keep their entries secured. Please note, if you already have a blog or a website, you don't have to start a LiveJournal. Just share your link, and we'll travel there.

By linking our LiveJournals as FRIENDS, we can ""hear"" each other's stories whenever we have a moment to sit a spell and share. I hope this inspires you to do so.

Interested in testing the waters? Great! Come on. It's not too cold. There's no riptide. Just dip in a toe. See below for the nitty-gritty on what to do ...

more on storytelling and Rachel Remen: 
<i>""... there is a deep river of meaning that runs beneath the events of our daily lives ... especially the lives of physicians ... (We) ... have rich and unusual experiences but never have a chance to reflect upon them or discuss them with colleagues. This is our chance. Sharing personal & professional stories on such topics as healing, compassion, harmlessness ... grace and listening, draws upon our universal experiences that we have as physicians and reminds us of our collective purpose and calling.""

<b><i>PLEASE NOTE:</i> This LiveJournal is for FRIENDS only. You can read more entries only if you're a FRIEND ...

Interested? Here's what you need to do:</b>

(1) Go to http://www.livejournal.com/ Click on <i>create you own LiveJournal.</i>

(2) Make your own LiveJournal:

a. suggestion: do not use your real name for the username.

b. security: If you don't want your journal to be open to the public, make it accessible to FRIENDS only. You can make sure all your entries are automatically FRIENDS ONLY by changing your setting. This is like making sure that the door to the dressing room is always closed first before you start changing. For more information, see http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=120

(3)  Be sure to add me (kahunaloca) to your friends list. Then I'll ""friend you back"" so you can read all my entries. You can't read my entries unless I list you as a friend. For more info, see http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=24

(4) If you're posting a story about a patient, please be sure to change their name. Remember HIPPA.

(5) Respect at all times. No flaming, please.

"event","<font color=green>Hey! Yesterday, I met a superhero!

He was considerably shorter in real life than I'd ever expected.

His alias: not-so-mild-manner J'e.
Occupation: Saving the world before bedtime (borrowed from the Power Puff girls)

What pip! J'e is solidly built like a snowman -- pumpkin head on top of a larger pumpkinish body and short sturdy legs. He knows more WWF moves than the average 3 year old. He came into the office with a markedly <blink>green</blink> face.

""Don't ask,"" muttered his mother. Clearly she wasn't happy with his cosmetic changes. I think it was one of those run-around-ragged afternoons. Total mom-to-mom sympathy there. This super-kid is fun to enjoy, but after our check-up's, I am always so THANKFUL I have two daughters instead of sons. Anyway, I tugged up his tee-shirt so I could listen to his heart, and lo -- his belly was completely covered with green scribble-scrabble. He looked like a Muppet.

""Oh, dear God!"" his mom shouted. ""I can't leave you alone for a minute.""

I smiled. Maybe it wasn't professional of me, but at least I didn't laugh out loud. It was really hard not to, and I think I got a hernia from all that repressed laughter.""That's really something,"" I think I said. 

Scowling, J'e bulked up his arms and grunted. ""Sure is. I'm the Hulk! Watch out. I'm radio-ack-ack.""

I promised him that I would indeed watch out, and if I had to wash my hands extra careful to rinse out the green radio-ack-ack stuff from my skin, it was worth the giggle.

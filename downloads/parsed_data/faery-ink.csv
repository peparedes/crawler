Exaustion."

"event","Hokay folks.  This is <lj user=""isilwenmacar"">'s writing journal.  And right now, it's the first day of NaNoWriMo.  And I need to get the hell started.

Friend me if you want, but not everything will be public.  Some of it is just to save my work so I can get to it from anywhere.

Peace out."

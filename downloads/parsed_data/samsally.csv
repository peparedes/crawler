<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/Samsally/cpic7.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
Saria:  It's about Ellarose, she's been driving me up the friggin' -wall- all of a sudden.
Amadeus:  *thinking* Oh my god... oh my god... Its the other one, pleeeease don't look behind you....
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/Samsally/cpic10.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
Saria:  She's just been spazzing about this new guy.  I haven't met him yet, but I doubt he's worth the fuss she's making.
Amadeus:  *thinking*  Hey... wait... that wasn't very nice.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/Samsally/cpic12.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
Saria:  All in all, you've just made Ellarose even worse than she was before, the stuck up prick, and now I'm going to have to deal with this guy is too, as if we even -needed- a man around.  With the way -she's- been going off he's probably just some stuck up jerk who thinks he's gods gift to women or something.  I bet he isn't even cute.  I hope you're properly ashamed of yourself, Lady.

"event","found this poem- was perfect for my life right now, incase u've been under a rock or sumthing my journals been moved go to www.bubbleslut.tk

I'm giving up on loving 
you I cant take the pain you've put me through
Deep down I know the feelings are always there 
Maybe someday you will care
At least for now I can hide my pain 
I know if I dont, I'll go insane
Our time apart has made me realize 
There is no second chance when it comes to guys 
I almost had you back one time 
But of course, you changed your mind 
The many excuses that you have told
Are getting lame and really old 
We never talk anymore
Its like a room to ur life and u've slammed the door
It hurts to know you've shut me out 
Now i know wut love is all about 
You're happy then u cry and cry 
Where there was truth becomes all lies
All in all it never ends for good
But then again, who thought it would?"

Just like the wind,
I've always been
Drifting high up in the sky that never ends
Through thick and thin,
I always win
'Cause I would fight both life and death to save a friend
I face my destiny every day I live
And the best in me is all I have to give
Just like the sun
When my day's done
Sometimes I don't like the person I've become.
Is the enemy within a thousand men?
Should I walk the path if my world's so dead ahead?
Is someone testing me every day I live?
Well, the best in me is all I have to give
I can pretend.
I am the wind.
And I don't know if I will pass this way again.
All things must end.
Goodbye, my friend.
Think of me when you see the sun or feel the wind.
I am the wind,
I am the sun
And one day we'll all be one"

"event","Omgosh! I haven't written forever! Ew and all the other stuff i've been writing about is the bad stuff! so! Here's the good stuff, no not good, completely totally AWESOME! like i mean incredible, lol I'm bout sick as a dog right now and i still feel great beacuse of all this....
It starts out kinda weird, Me and chris have been talking and seriously i thought we'd be going back out by now. but a couple of weeks ago i thought i might like someone else, and i flipped out and i did the stupid shit i normally do when i get scared. anyway i avoided chris at a football game, cuz i heard he was gonna ask me out, and that lead to an super great/bad convo online. We ended up telling eachother how we really felt about eachother, and it was INCREDIBLE! I have never felt that way in my life, I told him how i felt about our relationship and that i didnt think we should go back out, but everything else was good, he told me he loves me.... I was so scared it was like an awesome way he said it though he was like ""without a doubt i just love u "" i was like omgosh, like i dunno the whole idea of loving someone scares me, like all the people i've loved, except my daddy, have screwed me over in more then one way, either that or i end up screwing them over, which is even worse! 
Then i felt really really horrible, like I love chris. and i told him i didnt want to betogether, hes like one of my best friends and i have a connection with him like nothing i've ever experienced before and i dont want to go out with him whats wrong with me, then i was like hello! I'm terrified of getting this close to anybody, I figured if i stopped now and ignored we had gotten this close, everything would be ok and i could move on... and i was so wrong. 
I dunno about anything right now, except that when im with him i get the most incredible feeling ever! like its crazy!"

anyway me and chris! omgosh! lol. last night at the game (we won btw against hamilton 21 to 12) he was all like finding cute ways to touch me and stuff, and he'd put his amrs around me. omgosh the way he holds me like that, like oh man. i dunno it feel so good. just like tonight though he was say all this sweet stuff like he told me that he loves bein with me and he likes me soo much its def. good crazy (we were talkin bout good crazy and bad crazy lol) and omgosh this is the best though. he goes ""i like ya more than i have ever really liked someone before"" i was like o-m-gosh! EEEEEEEEEE! lmao (inside joke) but wow i heard he's gonna ask me out soon im like yes!
anyway one of my really good friends from like kindergarten to 3rd grade moved back. he didnt move till 5th grade but we weren't as close between 3rd and 5th grade. anyway like i never realized how much i missed him till he came back and we started hangin out again.

i dont really think i have to go into the obvious ones but i will!
LoL he's hott! he's got such pretty eyes! he's got a cute smile! and damn his body isnt bad at all...lol
ok but besides being hott he's so cute, like his personality, he's just adorable! and he's such a sweetie, he tells me all these super sweet things about me and it just drives me crazy, deffinetly good crazy though!! 
he makes me laugh, even though  i dont think he does it on purpose which is so great. He's so fun to be with! and i don't have to worry about the way i act around him cuz i feel like he's not gonna judge me, im really comfortable around him.
even though he's kinda quite i think its kinda cute, ya know, like if he talked more it'd be ok but i kinda like how i never know what he's thinkin, it keeps me guessin.
basically he'd be so perfect if he wasnt so square, but even thats ok because that's deffinetly something fixable.
like i dunno but i think the best thing about him is the way i feel when he touches me, like it makes me feel so good about myself, and when he hugs me i feel totally safe, like nothing matters because I'm with him and there isn't anything else that i want more then that. 
even though i've been struggling with so many things, I'm sure of this, and that feeling is so great, its unbelievable...

AND I GET TO SEE HIM TOMORROW!!! Heeeeeeeyy!!!!! lol and he said he'd call me tomorrow!! OH YEH!!"

anyway my family's just drivin me crazy, they do all this great stuff for me and i treat them like shit, i hate them, i dont understand y.
andy's an ass, we'll leave it at that.
I feel like i only have a few real friends, and even them im not sure about, its like when im with them its all good, but then when i go think about it i feel like maybe they dont really want to be around me. most of my true friends i treat like shit. WHY do i do this? all the ppl i care about i treat like shit, i just hate them i dont know why, i hate the way i act around them and the way i feel when im with them, i just hate it. UH!!
gosh chris, wow, i dunno i luv him. i dunno what will happen if we dont get back together that might be enough to break me. i dunno whats goin on. 
Im so glad my brothers leaving. i dont get how he can be talking to me like a normal person one minute and the next be putting me down and making me feel worthless. this is insane! my life is insane! i want to be the one leaving, i'd do anything to trade lives with my brother, i dont know why ppl dont understand that. I envy him so much, i look up to him, or what he's done with his life anyway. it doesnt matter as far as im concerned when he leaves tomorrow hes out of my life...

My day was great incase u care, why does one little thing that lasted 10 minutes have to screw up the other 23 hours and 50 minutes of my day?!

Shit maybe not, i dunno maybe this whole journals bull shit and i dont have any idea how i feel or whats goin on in my life... actually im starting to think thats pretty damn close to the truth

"event","I want to scream, and laugh, and cry at the same time. Maybe if i jump out of my window i'll start flying and be able to fly away from everything. or maybe i'll just fall 2 stories, guess both sound pretty good right now. 
I dont know what's wrong with me, that probably my biggest problem. i feel so completely lost. like nothing is right. and everything is ok. like i want everything to change, but i dont know what those chages will bring so maybe everything is good now.
I feel so good about myself right now, just about. expecially on the outside. but inside im all screwed up. I feel like im fighting myself. i dont know why but everytime i feel this way is when i fight with someone, when i fight with my mom i get super stressed and upset and i want to hurt her like i dunno and now i kidna feel that way about myself. 
its like i dont know how to express myself to make me or anyone else understand what im feeling and im so sick of this. I want to let ppl know im messed up inside, but i dont want anyone to know how i feel. I want to figure this out myself, but i dont know how.
Like the whole thing is im not sure of anything, my friends, family, b/f, my life in general. the only thing im really sure of is me. 
I want to give my life a make over and the main thing i started with is giving myself to God, but i dont feel like im getting anywhere with that. its like im looking for something and i've almost found it but i cant have it cuz i dont know how to get it. I know that everything will be fine when i let God take over, but i dont know if i want everything to be fine. why do i feel like this?
My friends r so important to me, but its also important to me that i have good friends, and by surrounding myself by as many as possible i've lost something in everyone. I dont need drug down and i cant let my friends do that to me, but i dont know how to stop it. i cant do this. i went to the mall with emiley last night everything's so different with us. we've grown so far apart and we've changed so much. i hurts to think maybe that part of my life is over, she was so good for me, i honestly love her with everything i have (in a non-lesbian sort of way) and i dont want to let her go, i cant imagine my life without her, but the truth is i am without her, and i dont think im going to get her back.
i cant stand my family, i love them, but whenever im with them i get so ticked off. just looking at them and hearing their voices makes me want to scream. my mom can be so stupid it kills me, i know thats harsh but its true. we can't even be in the same room without fighting. and i dont need that right now, i dont know how to stop it. she takes everything so personally, if i tell her i just want to be alone im afraid she'll either take it liek i dont want to be with her, or try to ""talk"" to me. and i dont want to talk to her!
my brother feels the same way about me that i feel about mom, he just doesnt like me, i cant do anything about that its his problem but it still hurts.
dad is totally a different story, he's so calm about everything its annoying. he has his mind set that there's one way to do something and THATS the right way. i cant make him understand anything. he says he listens so why doesnt he get it.
chris, gosh, i dunno, i like him but then again i don't and i really hope he doesnt see this cuz its not like i want to break up, i miss him so much it hurts and its really hard cuz i want to be alone with him but because of my parents stupid dating rule i cant go anywhere just me and him i always have to drag along a friend. it sucks, i know this may be easier without him but i dunno. it used to be that it hurt to even think about breaking up, but now, its like maybe it's the right thing to do. but i dont know if i want it to be permanent, i dont want to lose him like i lost brandon. its not because of brandon this time either, yeh brandons cool but i kinda realize us getting back together wont happen, i like him, but its like i dont care anymore. chris told me last night that he feels like i want to break up with him. but i kinda think maybe he wants to break up. i dunno this is what he said.

Soccercj17 (10:35:46 PM): we have been goin out for a while and its really not goin that well in my opinion   the way i feel about it is i'm draging u onto a ride u don't wanna go on..... u know what i mean? its like u want to break up with me but u don't because u think i will be hurt.....its not like that at all i will be disappointed but i will feel much worse if we end up staying together when u would rather be with someone else or alone and from going out with me i'm holding u back u know what i mean 

if its not going well why does he want to stay together? it would be easier if he dumped me cuz that way i wouldnt go back and think i made the wrong decision. i wish we could have everything we have now with out being together. that would be the perfect situation.

i dunno like i said im unsure of my life right now. i want to push everyone away from me, just count them out of my life so i don't have to worry about anyone but me. i know i'll be lonely but i need some alone time and this is really a bad time to get all depressed meghan!!! fair is in a week! get it together."

"event","well i dunno where to start,
my week was kinda loaded Monday i slept in, Tuesday i went to tennis camp, Wednesday i went to tennis practice, Thursday i went to tennis camp, then sarah came over and took me to the pool, then i rode, then i went back to the pool for teen night which half way through started pooring down rain, ew.
Friday i tried to ride. which, umm i dunno. 
I've been under so much emotional stress lately that im deffinetly at breaking point. She spooked at the door we had gone past 100 times and when i couldnt get her to go past it normaly i lost it. I jerked on her face and did a bunch of stuff to really tick her off. I always thought i had a lot of patience, i dunno what happened. I was so upset. i was like crying and i hate letting ppl see me cry, its just something bout crying that says im weak. I am weak though, im lossing strength so fast, expecially emotionaly. i get upset sometimes, but this isn't like me, I feel so happy sometimes then all of a sudden my world falls apart. I dunno how to explain it.
I didnt ride saturday like i should have, i dont think i did anything yesterday really.
I went to a show today. I got to see emiley!!! YAY! lol i miss her! she's coming to red white and boom with me thursday!! lol. anyway i warmed her up and she felt kidna off but nothing bad then i got in the show pen and she's be going great and all of a sudden she'd go like dead lame. it was scary. i didnt showin in 3 of my classes because of that, then we talked to Jen and she said to soak her foot and ride in my last class. so i did and i got 5th which wasnt too bad there were like 9 horses in the class, most of them were crap but w/e.
Today mom and cindy were talking about bobbi maybe having EPM, and even though i over heard already, i pretended i didnt, i was kinda hurt they didnt tell me striaght to my face. I wanted to get clearer details too so ya know. 
But with her lameness we think she has an absess in her right front. i have to soak it twice a day in hot water and epsome salt and then put this tar stuff in her foot and duct tape it so it stays in. Its really pretty gross. i hope it blows out before fair. we have like 2 weeks.

I realized something at the pool thursday, A few of my friends bring a lot of drama with them into a friendship, and right now i don't need their bull. I'm letting go of some friendships, mainly because in my life right now the most important thing is my relationship with God. and There are certain ppl who aren't good ppl to surround myself with now as im struggling, There's also some friends i want to grow closer to Again. like those who i used to be tight with who we have drifted, the main one Emiley, i miss her so much. and Joe, he's always been so good to me, and i could really use his support right now.
well mom and dad are back from olive garden with a salad. im out ttyl."

"event","oh boy, lol first weekend I show and I do it double time. ew. lol I'm so tired and sore. I've ridden every day this week! I'm really proud of myself. Bobbi's doin so good too! Jen's been awesome. She's always there when i need her. Anyway we went to Circleville Friday night. Somehow Bobbi ended up limping like so bad. But then Jen got there and we cleaned up her foot, I guess what happened was her shoe was loose and a rock or sumthin had gotten stuck under it. I ended up showin her and Jen rode her to help me warm her up. I got a 4th in Equitation! lol yay go us!!
I rode yesterday and Jen helped me braid. lol that was a HUGE help!! We tried to give bobbi some bute cuz we figured she's prolly sore ya know. OMGOSH! she's like the biggest fricken whimp! ok i know it taste bad(i tried it) but its not that big of a deal. we we're trying to get it in her mouth and she kept rearin up and she made it like impossible to twitch her so when i finally got it in her mouth somehow it all came back in my face. lol it was entertaining for mom and Jen im sure.
Today at the shoe the farrier put new front shoes on Bobbi. I had some pretty good rides but not great. she was bein kinda goofy. I got a 4th and a 5th...i dont remember what in. Jen showed her twice and that was really good for Bobbi. Rachel and Wendy were there! Which made it super awesome! lol
I overheard Cindy and Jen and my parents talking while i was getting ready to go home, they think Bobbi might have EPM. i dunno exactly what it is but its a nurilocical diseas and it cost a lot to treat and lost of horse's have been getting in recently. Cindy's husbans horse had to be put down because of it earlier this year. I dunno I'm so scared I don't really have the guts to think about what could happen. Honestly i don't think they know i know, i mean i dunno how i couldnt have heard but no ones said anything to me about it."

...hmmm im trying to decide whether i look good in my glasses or like a dork...
anyway, Chris is in kentucky. i miss him. not really cuz he's in ky, actually that IS a big part of it, but i don't get to see him enough. i really like him and i dont want anything to happen with us. i want this to actually go somewhere. i dunno. ya know how when u like someone and the first time u hug them or hold their hand or sumthin u get this like tingly feeling. its totally like that only its everytime he touches me. its like omgosh never ever leave me. i want him so bad and i feel like there's something there, just standing there between us, keeping us from getting closer...
im kinda sick of being stereotyped as a ditz. it's true though i AM a ditz, that doesn't bug me. what bugs me is ppl make fun of me because of it. what makes me even more ticked off is when someone tried to tell me who i am. i KNOW who i am, and i LIKE who i am, for the most part. so even when some is trying to tell me im not me to make me feel better, its not the truth. and honestly i don't have a problem with the truth. the truth doesn't scare me, in this case anyway. so alex i luv ya but please don't try to tell me who i am, let me be me.
I've ridden the last 3 days! >x< YES! i know i'm awesome. i dunno when the last time was that i've ridden everyday for a week. lol that's what im goin for this week, i have a show friday, or maybe sunday. anyway since the arena was closed today Morgan talked me into a trail ride. o wow, may not have been the smartest thing but it was fun. there was this one place which was muddy so i decided to go around not knowing around was twice as muddy and Bobbi like sunk to her knees. i was pretty proud of her though, she didn't freak out, she was like stuck and falling and just pulled herself out. lol. then we went back by the pond and she got all ""excited"" and i thought she was settling down then all of a sudden she flew backwards and hit Amy. i felt kinda bad but it was funny. 
it's almost 1, wow im kinda tired but i don't really feel like goin to bed, so 'night yall don't let the bed bugs bite!"

So Shauna, Scotty, Chris, and I walked around canal for a while then sat on the corner of my street and waved to cars as they went past. ok so yeh we're lozers. anyway i called Scotty's mom and asked if Chris could spend the night, lol i know im a dork, anyway she said yes. so after mom went to sleep me and Shauna snuck out(it was like 1 am lol) to see Chris and Scotty. it was great!! We all hung out in our neighbors gazebo. lol the bull frogs sounded like horny cows!! im dead serious!! the brandon frog... lol nvm inside joke. then at like 3:30 we walked to my house and stood in my neighbors back yard and talked lol. then at like shauna and i were like ok go home we were sooo tired lol. so i like kissed him and was like go home lol. i was soo tired i dont remember much... oh well. Shauna and i were like dead this morning so we got out of going to church.

I'm so gonna stop. it's not worth losing someone i like over, its not right either.
I got in a huge fight with mom today, i dunno what the deal is. basically what happened was i told her i wasnt riding she told me to call and tell cindy and we decided to sell the horses, cuz i told them thats what i want. thats not what i want. for the longest time riding was the only thing that made me feel good about myself. now that i'm confident enough to drift away from that stuff its nice to know that i'll always be able to go back to it whenever i need help. it hurts to think that im losing that. i dunno im gonna try to stick it out till fair and see what happens. 
I promised myself i would never feel this way about someone again, look what happens."

i don't feel good. not like sick i just dont feel good. I feel like i've been fighting depression so long. i cant figure out if i really am depressed or just bored. im so confussed about so many things. when i want to be alone everyones in my face and when im lonely no one's around. I'm not sure what the deal is. 
I don't know what i'm looking for. i dont know whats right and wrong and i dont know who to go to who can answer my questions. 
I have a deep desire for a relationship with God but i keep searching for something and i can't find it. i don't even know what im looking for or if its even there to find. 
I'm being torn two ways. Im so happy with what i have, or i guess who i have but i want what i cant have so bad. i never thought one mistake could affect me this much. its been like 10 months and it still tears me apart. 
im looking for happiness in material things and i know that not right but i dont know how to find it anyother way. 
im not happy with myself and the few things i can fix i dont have the self control to do. i seriously should be on a diet i've gain 15 lbs. in the last like 2 months. thats not good. 
i dont know what to do, i guess thats mainly cuz i dont knwo whats wrong. the worst part is i wish i could hide this from everyone but im not real good at that. i dont really feel like talkin to anyone or being with anyone i just want to be alone. like as far away from everyone as possible."

Bobbi has sumthin goin on with her hind legs, we're not sure what but we r getting her checked out by Carter soon. Jen said a posibility may be its so bad she wont be able to jump. thats what i want to do but i love bobbi soo much i knew selling her was in the plan eventually but not untill i had gone as far as i could with her. i guess if thats the case i'll have to choose between her and jumping. i'm sure i could jump other ppl's horses but its not as cool as knowing ur very own horse is doin sumthin so awesome. Cylects for sale. hmm this doesnt really bug me but im gonna miss him. i went out to ride him the other day, just with a halter and lead rope and i took him back to the track and i was like sobbing. its gonna be like loosing a best friend. speaking of which emiley and i have grown so far apart. i miss her like crazy but i don't know what to do. it feels like we r living in 2 different worlds and getting farther apart by the second. it feels like its too late to stop drifting.

IM NOT AS SMART AS THEY THINK!!! y cant they see this. its always Andy's this smart so u should be able to do better.  and andy can do this so can u. i think its great they have this much faith in me but im not as great as they think i am. the truth is i could do better, maybe but its not something i want to do. they say we can always talk to them and stuff so i told mom today i didn't think i could pull the c up and she said i was full of shit. HELLO!!?!?! ur supposed to listen to me!! UH! i cant do this im gonna break! 
Gods great. He's always there i can tell Him anything and I know He'll help me. i've been soo sinful but God loves me.

been thinking more about God and stuff and its soo hard to understand anything! I excepting Christ but what now? i don't feel comfortable talking to anyone about this. i don't know who to go to for answers to my questions. abba everyone keeps tellin me ur there and i think i belive it i really want to can't u show me??

I haven't heard about my aunt. She was supposed to know a couple days ago and no ones told me anything so that can't be good. i dunno what to do, i've really wanted to be closer to my cousin lately though. He's completely immature and clueless but he's cool and we'd have fun together, we do whenever we hang out, i think we should hang out more. maybe i'll get his sn or sumthin... if he has aol or aim.

Chris and will have gone out for 2 month friday!! lol and im not completley bored with him yet! ok key word completley. HELLO Im ur gf are u planning on making any move or do i have to do it?!?! er. lol anyway i feel like such a prude hahaha!!!! i think i need to just say screw what everyone else thinks and what he thinks and start acting like the slut i know i can be. lol. He's awesome though. dunno he always makes me smile im always happy around him.

I saw Emiley and Melissa and Busy Beth and all my lil babes from shoo-fly!!! I luv them and miss them so much!! this summer im gonna try to schedule the perfect balance between friends tennis and both horses. deffinetly friends!! i miss emiley soo much! she's my best friend and i never see her anymore. tennis shouldnt be a problem cuz that doesnt take too long and summer gym is only the first part of summer. and i may not be doing that. bobbi needs training and cylect need conditioning! EH!! im gonna be busy so im so sry guys if i can't do a lot this summer.

I miss my brother, he's not even gone yet. i've missed him since i was like 8 years old that was the last time we really were close. how close can u be when ur 8 and 12?? i mean for real?? eh i left him a note in his locker the other day i never knew if he got it im gonna check tomorrow. i dunno its weird.

I dunno what i would do without Alex. He's like totally my big brother. He's alway there for me and he so awesome!! i can tell him ANYTHING!!! he always listens!! i dunno i luv him! lol.

If she does she will have to go through Chemo and that sort of thing. This is really hard to think about.  Cancer is so common but i never thought of it effecting someone so close to me.  i have no idea if this will even change anything, for me anyway. I know everything will change for her and her family. I really want to know more about whats going on. My cousin and i arent very close but he's only 6 months older then me and we're pretty cool together. I want to be there for him if he needs me, i dunno i alway want to help with things i can't i always want to be the one with the good advice and something comforting to say its just a weird thing for me.

I hear of these ppl beign saved and their lives change drastically but, with me nothings different. I want to believe and i do but i don't know how to act on any of it.  I want to tell everyone that He is the Father and he loves me just as much as he loves everyone else but i don't know how.  I feel like im being left out of something really awesome and i don't know how to be included.  It makes me hurt so bad.  I cry about it but i don't know y, maybe im feeling sorry for myself i dont know. I want this so bad but i don't understand how im supposed to get it.  I'm told everyday God loves me and I'm reminded constantly of sin.  but it's like im not hearing it. i know whats wrong and right.  I know god loves me in my head but i want to feel it in my heart.  

Im totally losing emiley. I love her so much. i don't know what to do. we're drifting so far apart we can't even talk to eachother anymore with out runnign out of things to say.  I feel like i've been such an awful friend. gosh this is all my fault.  I've never had a friend like her before and i'll never have another one. i want to tell her how i feel but i don't know how. i know what i feel but i don't know how to say it. i love her. more then any other person i didn't know it was possible to love someone this much, or hurt this much when u lose them.  

I had a dream about chris lastnight. lol o gosh he is so hott. he's such a sweetie do. i wish he wasnt so shy but he is talking a lot more and i think hes more comfortable around me.  I really like being with him alone he's a lot easier to talk to i dunno why. anyway last night in my dream he was blonde he was a hott blonde too lol. i dunno what the deal with that was but w/e.  i havent talked to him since before 5th period yesterday lol this is sad but i miss him oh no its been over 24 hours since i talked to him im going through withdraw! um no lol anyway i dunno i like him so much.  

I keep thinking about brandon though. i swear i saw him driving the other day. his sister was in the passenger side smoking and soem other girl was in the back.  but hes a year younger then me too young to drive lol anyway if it was him he was looking good!! the dumbest thing i ever did was dump him. but theres nothing i can do about that. I get to see him at fair though thats less then 4 months away! yes! lol.

Ok so a few months ago randilyn met matt at the movies. I guess they've been talking online and on the phone since then and randilyn introduced him to sarah. well somehow something got messed up and its into this big arguement now. i don't totally understand it they tried to explain it but im still confussed. what i do get out of it is its totally stupid and not worth fighting over but i dunno. Anyway i've been talking to matt online and he's so cool. i guess he likes me to. he keeps saying stuff about how chris is so awesome and it sucks that im taken but there is no way im dumping chris for him i like chris a lot!! 

yesterday my gma came over to go to my brothers base ball game. while they were at the baseball game i took an old long sleeve chirt and made the cutest tank top out of it and a pair of jeans that were getting too short and made capries out of then that r soo cute. they're LEI and they have 3 buttons up the front and 2 fake pockets in the front and no pockets in the back and omgosh they're just really cute. they're dark blue. ok anyway joe just called so im gonna talk to him for a while im out ppl Hugz~n~Kissez"

Usually I would just say screw this ur to quiet but i like him to much to do that. I don't know what to do to make him more u know. 

I just got back from my brothers baptism. I think a lot about God and being a Christian and I don't understand a lot of it.  I feel like it's something I want but I'm not the kind of person to get it.

AH! this sucks! ok well i keep worrying about some of my friends. one of them i dont even know personally!! gosh! i feel like sucha hypocrite sayin this but im really worried about them. The ppl they hand around with then person one of them is turning into, she's not the girl i remember. she used to be so happy and dare i say perky and now somethings changed so much in her. she's a completely different person. I'm just getting into this stuff with the Bible and God and i havent ever felt so secure its so awesome! I was talkin to one of my friends and he said he had given up on God because He had screwed him over to many times. That really disterbed me. I know somethings not right about that.  One of my other friends who i don't really know to well but he's cool. His profile says he hates Christians and i don't understand y. I mean uh! it just frusterates me I don't know what to do about them! I almost think they're scared of something, maybe they're scared to find out they may be wrong i dunno.  I want all 4 of you to know I'm praying for you and i love you!!

OK EMILEY!! U R NOT FAT!! OK!?!?! Gosh! If i hear that from you again im gonna have to hurt someone!! I look up to u and admire you so much! Emiley u r so pretty! Your so much fun to be with!! If it weren't for you i wouldnt be who i am today. so seriously girl look in the mirrior!!! whats not to love about u!!

O gosh about this war. I don't get it! I don't like the idea of fighting like this. People are going to Die and somehow this will resolve everything. I don't understand.

I need all of my friends and i want you all to know if you need me u can come to me about anything. I'll listen and I cant garentee i'll understand but i'll try and i'll help you as best i can. I want you all to know I'm praying for you and if you could do me a favor pray for me. thanx guys i love ya!!!

I have mono! YAY! omgosh! this bites!!! im not gonna be in school for a while and i have to cancel all my plans this weekend! i don't get to see Chris! :( gosh! anyway Joe called me from school like right after the doctor called. He had the results of the horse judging contest. I got 1st! YES! our team got 2nd out of 6 teams and we have 20th overall! how cool is that? we get a plack and stuff .x. YES! 
I've been think of some stuff and i came up with two very true quotes
~Love everyone, but be careful who you fall in love with.
~Don't dry your tears unless your done crying.

Church Sunday was good. It was about love and it made a lot of sence. It was over 1 Corintians 13 i want to type out some of the things i liked best but u should read the whole thing its really good.
1 Corinthians 13 4Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envey, it does not boast, it is not proud.  5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easliy angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  6Love does not delight in evel but rejoices with truth.  7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perservers.

That's perfect love.  How awesome is that? i'm so blown away that there is something like that. I dunno i really like thoes verses. read the rest of it it's just as good"

"event","gosh i havent written for so long! i dunno whats goin on with me. everyone knows that i totally like chris! i mean chris totally got me off of brandon and i know if he did that its obvious i like him a lot! dont i? i mean i think i do. but tonight i made the mistake of actually thinking about whats goin on. i can't see how chris and i fit together. we're completely oposite. im really affraid im just gonna end up board with him. i dont want another guy to go out with for a few weeks then him totally be outa my life, expecially not someone i like as much as chris. and as much as i like chris i think im getting to like someone else too, but i cant really. or rather i shouldnt. mainly cuz if ppl find out i could screw a lot of stuff up. anyway he doesnt like me so i can just forget about it. i dunno i think if chris was more comfortable around me i'd feel a lot better about this. i don't know him very well and i dunno how this whole things gonan turn out. so im thinking if chris doesn't ask me out im going to stop pushing it and try to get to know him better. i know he likes me but i dont do a lot of stuff around him and with him thati normally would with a bf, cuz i dunn owhat his reaction is gonna be. anyway i gotta get up for church in the morning, oh Ha look it is morning. lol chris's b-day too. dout he'll read this but Happy B-day babe! luv ya lots!!"

Sunday
Wow! The last 2 days have been absolutly awesome! Yesterday I was up at 3 AM. Preperation is one of the most overwhelming parts of vacation. We left the house around 3:30 AM and drove in 6 in. of snow to the airport.I thought dad was gonna kill us a few times. lol! After waiting for awhile to get our bags chacked (freezing our butts off in the process) we stood in line to get our carry ons checked(omgosh way to much hurry up and wait).
Flying is one of the awesomest things ever! I thought i was gonna be really freaked out, but no im seriously considering being a piolet. Watching the sunrise out the window of the plane was awesome. On our second plane I had a clear view out the window. The clouds looked like puffy piles of whipped cream(I love whipped cream!!), I just wanted to reach out and grab a handful!
It was really weird ariving in Florida. Only a few hours earlier we were fighting snow drifts, now we were stripping sweatshirts like crazy! There is nothing about Florida i don't like, but one of the coolest things was watching out the window as we flew overhead. You could see boats on the boats on the water and streams and trees and even a few birds. The water was gorgeous, changing colors from a teal green to a deep blue.
After changing into our bathing suits(my really cute cherry bikini!) we grabbed lunch and hung out on the beach. We walked on the shore with the waves barely lapping our feet looking for sea shells. There's tons of them! They are all so pretty! We found 3 live conks. They were so cool! There were a couple jelly fish washed up on shore, they're really weird looking. I totallu see where they got their name. There was a horseshoe crab washed up too, I almost felt sorry for him. 
Dad and I watched the sunset over the water. It was so incredible! The sun was so clear and there wasnt much color, it just looked like the waves washed it away.
Today was so nice. I am truely on vacation! After breakfast we went down and walked on the beach somemore. Some shells have tiny holes in them and we decided to colletc thoes and make jewlery. The water is so refreshing.Its totally smooth. We layed out today while dad read to us, I think im getting tan!! When we got really hott we jumper in the pool, that water is warmer then out side. It's crazy! It still felt good though. The pool water is salty! Like instead of chlorine they just pump and filter ther ocean water.
Andy, Dad, and I threw the baseball around on the beach. For hardley ever doing that im pretty good. Mom cheered for me ever time i actually caught the ball! I thought andy broke my thumb at one point! We had an euker tournement, dad won (i think he cheats)
And didn't feel good so he didn't go out to eat with us tonight, I think he just wanted to have privacy while he called Lauren. During dinner mom commented that he probably missed her so i siad that i missed Emiley! (dont u feel loved now em?) lol. I had ribs so i brought some home for Andy, aren't i a good sister?
It's raining and Im sitting out on the porch in front of our hotel room. It's a little chilly but there's a warms breeze. I miss cala a lot but im going to totally love this vacation.!

Wednesday.
     The last few days of vacation have been as great as the first 2! This whole thing has gone by so fast im almost sad its over. I still can't wait to get home and see all my friends, expecially Chris and Emiley!
We start and end almost every day with a walk on the beach. Monday we mostly hung around the pool and layed in the sun. Dad started reading us a book but we all agreed it wasnt the greatest. On our evening walk we found a lot of conk shells. Most were occupied by hermit crabs but we found a lot of really pretty emty ones. We also found a few that had a long spiral on the end, I'll have to look up what they are called later. After we were back at our hotel room we took a while to relax and get out of the sun. I was sitting out side the room when moom made a lond sort of yelp. I went inside to see what was going on, and as I opened the door i ran right into dad. He was carring one of our conks, and i could tell what mom was making the fuss about. A long dark pincher was creeping out of the shell. I couldnt help it i busted out laughing! since there's an $85 fee for taking live animals off the beash dad brought it back to the shore.
Tuesday was again another ""normal"" *Florida Vacation Day*! we collected ting shells called caquinos. They are connected and look like butterflied we found about a hundred of them, ok maybe only 20 or so but its still a lot. We talked to a lot of really nice people today and found out a lot about Florida. Today was so fun! Just like every other day . On our morning walk I made the mistake of splashing Andy, next thing i knew he had tackeled me and thrown min into the water. It was so funny! I hit the sand pretty hard and i have a scrape on my side but its ok, it doesnt bother me.
      We went shopping today!! Florida traffic is awful! I got a keychain and a post card. Im giving the post card to shauna because I told her i'd give her one. I got emiley a really cute necklace! I funally got to call emiley today! YAY!! We only got to toalk for 10 minutes but it was so good to talk to her. I miss her so much!
btw, have you ever seen an old guy in a speedo? O-M-GOSH!! lol. there's this one guy here who wears a different speedo everyday. The firsty day he had a metallic one on! lol! I'll try to get a picture tomorrow.
Im sorta sad that tomorrow's my last day. I miss every1, but this has been so awesome! I don't know if i'll ever see the outrigger again. I dout it. It's sad to think about but im so glad i got this chance"

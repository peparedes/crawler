"event","Hello everyone.  Just wanted to see how everyone's summer has been going.  Mine has been absolutely awesome.  I've made good money and gotten to spend time with my peoples.  I wanted to thank everyone that left me messages on the computer for my birthday.  I had a wonderful day.  I'm perfectly happy and content right now.  Everything just seems to be falling into place at just the right time.  I'm getting things together to move out and into my new place August 1st, band camp is coming up, and Eric and I are doing wonderfully.  I just wanted to leave a short little entry just to inform you guys of what's been up.  With me working as much as I have that's why I'm hardly ever on anymore.  I miss you guys so much and I'll talk to you all soon.

"event","Well as most of you guys know, I'm back at school again for the spring semester.  Feels SO GOOD to be back.  It's been great seeing everybody again.  I never thought I'd being saying that I missed school so much.  This semester should be a good one.  I've got to stay really focused though and I'm getting some support from Eric.  We're both helping each other stay focused this semester b/c both of us really need to buckle down.  To me, it'll seem like a big help to have him there cheering me on and me being able to do the same in return.  I know I'm a goofball, but that's just me...lol.  (Ask Laura if you don't believe me...lol...she'll be the first to tell ya I'm a goof ball.)  Unfortunately tomorrow my friend Manda's boyfriend Justin is being deployed over to Iraq for 7-14 months.  I ask all those you read this to keep him in your prayers and wish him a safe return home.  Manda's really worried and she'll appreciate the thoughts and prayers.  

But on a happier note, I'm extremely happy with everything in my life right now.  I may be switching to a job that is less stressful, my school work is going well so far, and I have wonderful friends and family to support me, and a very loving boyfriends which I love very much.  Ok, enough of the mushy stuff.  I just wanted to make sure that I try to keep this as up-to-date as possible.  For those of you who attend CCU, please come and support the Chants on Saturday for the basketball game.  Be ""pep-a-rific"" and come support pep band as well as our hard working athletes.  Catch you guys later and have a good night.

"event","Well hello again everyone.  I never thought I would say this but I miss school.  I miss hanging out with everyone.  It'll be great to go back and find out how everyone's vacation went.  Not much has happened here recently.  I've just been working my tail off and getting stuff ready to go back.  I've been spending a lot of time with family and spending time with Eric as much as I can.  I've never been happier with my life as I am right now.  It feels so wonderful to actually be happy again.  

I've had a little bit of drama over break but nothing to post up here and make it seem like I'm a drama queen.  Just old issues from the past have decided to rear it's ugly head and try to cause problems.  Nothing I can't handle :).  But anyway, I hope that everything is going well for everyone else and I look forward to seeing all of my peeps at CCU again real soon.

"event","Hello everyone.  Hope you all had a wonderful Christmas.  Mine was great.  I spent time with my family and got a lot of great gifts.  This break from CCU has been a long one, but at least I've been able to earn some cash and spend some time with Eric.  He's so sweet and so wonderful.  We've been taking turns traveling to each others houses and we exchanged gifts with each other b/c we knew Christmas Day would be hectic for the both of us.  He got me beautiful necklaces and a pair of earrings.  We gave our parents their gifts from us as well.  

I apologize for not keeping up with this journal as much as I use to.  I've been working a lot and usually whenever I get home from work I'm tired and usually crash.  I've just been keeping busy and working to earn some money.  

Tonight was a strange night.  It's amazing that people from your past will decide for no apparent reason to call you out of nowhere and want to talk to you like nothing ever went wrong.  Maybe I should back track a little.  My ex called me tonight...I wouldn't have talked to him if I didn't know for a fact that he is over in Iraq fighting for our country.  We had a pretty bitter break-up and he's now married.  He called me tonight to wish me a Merry Christmas since I wasn't home to answer his call on Christmas Day.  We haven't been together in over 2 years, now all of a sudden he cares about what I'm doing and how school is going.  I still hate what he did to me and what he put me through and at the same time my heart wants to forgive him since he is after all fighting for the freedom of the country in which we live in.  It's just hard to not want to forgive someone you were with for 4 yrs, but it's still hard to stay friends with someone who made you feel like nothing and who told you no one would ever love you b/c they never really loved you to begin with.  

No matter what though, there's no way I could ever feel the way I felt about him.  Eric and taken over that place in my heart and then some.  It's amazing that it took me almost 2 yrs to find someone like Eric.  Someone who makes me feel special, makes me feel loved, makes me feel wanted and needed.  Someone who doesn't put me down, but lifts me up.  I never thought that in a million years that I would ever find anyone to fill this void that I have kept in my heart for these years.  I would never do anything to jeopardize that happiness and that love. I may be able to forgive my ex but I can never forget all the pain and agony he put me through.  Well, I'm off for now.  I'll try to keep this updated more often then I have lately.  

Have a Happy New Year Everyone!!!! It's almost 2005!!! WOOHOO!!!!

"event","Today we had our ""symphonic band final""...it was LONG AND BORING....especially the main speaker, but after that it went pretty quick.  Afterward, I went and spent time with Eric and his family, and met his bro and his girlfriend.  We all had dinner together and just enjoyed ourselves.  We didn't get the decorations done, but I think we had as much fun just being all together.  Eric and I finished his shopping for his parents for Christmas.  It was just a good day all around.  I honestly can't remember ever being this happy with someone.  Not in a very long time.  

I have a full schedule tomorrow, from going to work til 8 to going down to my dad's and my step-sister's to go and see my nieces and nephew.  My newphew's birthday party is tomorrow...he's growing up so fast.  I'll probably end up waking up early Monday morning to see the kids off to school.  And sometime between tomorrow and Monday I have to make plans for Tuesday.  With Tuesday being the 14th Eric and I wanted to spend some time together since we will have been together for 3 months then.  More than likely I'll end up cooking lasagna for him since it's his favorite.  

Well folks, I better get off of this journal entry and try to get some sleep tonight.  After all, I've been running on 4 hours sleep today and I have a LONG day ahead of me tomorrow.  I'll have to catch up on my lost sleep from this semester sometime during break.  Maybe I'll get lucky and not have my mom wake me up early to do some stuff with her...lol.  Have a good night guys.  Keep in touch, and stay safe.

Happy Holidays :)

"event","Well, I finally had my jury today.  It went SO much better then I thought it would be.  I've been stressing out so bad lately and now I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.  I was afraid that I wouldn't have anyone there to tell me it would be ok, because I was so worried.  Thanks to Eric, Lauren, Dessy, and Rex...I didn't feel so worried.  Thanks you guys for helping me get through today.  With my challenging finals over with I can finally relax.  **breaths in deeply and releases slowly* Today was torture on my nerves but I got through.  Now I look forward to this weekend.  Decorating with Eric's family and getting to spend time with them.  I never imagined that I would be so liked by them.  I'm a lucky girl I guess.  In a way I guess my Christmas wish that I made a while back is finally coming true.  

*happy sigh* Unfortunately I have nothing else more that I can write on.  I'm just trying to now get my holiday baking done with mom and finishing up with wrapping presents.  I love Christmas time! To all my friends going home for the holidays....be careful and be safe.  See you guys next semester.

Happy Holidays everyone!!!!

"event","Why is it that people try to get in the way of things sometimes? I mean, I've never done anything to anyone and the only one that has beef with me is my ex because I caught him cheating.  I just want to be left to be happy with my boyfriend.  I don't ask for much...just peace.  This is the first time in literally YEARS that I've been truly happy, and I wish that some people (including my ex) could just leave me and my boyfriend be.  There are lyrics to a song by Nivea that explain exactly how I feel at the moment:

[Nivea]
It was hard to find a brotha that was down for me 
So I'm tellin everybody let him be
Cause he's mine and I can't take no pigeons tryna take my baby
So I thought I had to let you know
Find someone that you can call your own
Cause now you're walkin in the danger zone
And if I touch you I'll be wrong

If you mess with my man, I'ma be the one to break it to ya
Got my girls, got my man, so find your own and leave mine alone
Don't mess with my man, I'ma be the one to break it to ya
Here's a little advice for you, find your own man


Today has just not been a good day and the thoughts running through my head have not exactly been happy thoughts.  I've put on the happy face and tried to pretend nothing has been bothering me, but someone can only wear a mask for so long.  Like I said before I just want a chance to be happy and I wish people could accept that.  Well, now that I'm finished for the time being I guess it's time to go to bed and dream about my baby and the wonderful weekend we have ahead of us.  Take care everyone and have a good night.

"event","Well, my day didn't start out too great.  I woke up and read my email and then I had a Music Theory exam.  At least I only had one exam and I THINK I did good on it.  I'll have to wait and see.  I'm dreading my jury tomorrow.  I'm so worried about not doing well.  More than likely Eric will reassure me that everything will go fine.  He's so sweet.  He really cares about me and I really care about him.  I don't think there's nothing in this world we wouldn't do for each other.  
   Thank goodness Christmas break is almost here.  I really need it.  I've been stressing out so bad lately about classes that I just need a mental break.  My last ""final"" isn't until Saturday with the symphonic band.  After that I plan on spending the day with Eric.  We'll probably finish up our Christmas shopping and do something fun together.  Then I'll finally be able to relax and enjoy break.
   I'm going to miss all of my friends at CCU during break.  We'll have to all keep in touch and maybe all get together and do something.  Well, I'm done for the time being.  I need to get off and practice for juries tomorrow.  Wish me luck guys (I'm going to need it).

"event","This is a poem that I wrote shortly after my dumby of an ex contacted me after not speaking to me for over a year.  This was one of my moments where I had to sit down and write out my thoughts and feelings on paper.  Note that this is an OLD poem and that I no longer feel this way anymore.  If you'd like you may leave comments on your opinions of the poem.

Why Have You Come Back

You left me so long ago I didn't know what I had done,
I spend so much time loving you that now I didn't know what to do.
You use to make me feel special you told me that you loved me,
You up and disappeared one day, why I'm not so sure.
When I first tried to forget about you I couldn't think of anything else,
Now after all this time the memories of us were placed in the dark corners of my mind.
What has made you come back now so suddenly back into my life?

You've released the memories that I had locked up deep inside.
My heart is telling me it's okay, my head says not to listen,
I'd feel better knowing the reason for your presence.
I had moved on and started to feel like I could love and trust again,
But now you've reappeared and the gates to my emotions are jammed.
Jammed between allowing myself to trust and closing my emotions up tight,
Sealing them away forever, never to be felt again.
Should I be scared, should I even be second guessing myself?
Please answer me this single question,
Why have you come back?"

"event","Well...this is my first stab at keeping an online journal.  Hopefully I'll be able to keep it updated for you guys.  This week has been a busy week.  I can't wait til exams are over and I can relax for a whole month!!! YAY!!! This semester has been a good one.  I've made several wonderful friends and met the most wonderful person in the world.  For those of you who attend school with me, you all know who he is.  Words can't describe how happy he makes me.  i can't believe marching band season is over.  I'm really gonna miss the football games and the cutting up we all did.  It was a blast!!! Hopefully next season will be as good if not even BETTER.  If ever I decide to post my poetry that I have hidden somewhere in here please don't be alarmed.  I seem to write better poetry when I'm upset or angry.  I haven't felt that way in a VERY LONG TIME.  I vent through my writing and it's all older stuff, but I wouldn't mind sharing it with you all someday.  Well, I have run out of things to talk about and I really don't want to bore everyone with my nonsense.  I'll see if I can keep this updated for you all in case you ever get bored and want to read it.  I just want to give a shout out to all my friends at CCU and here at home in NC.  I love you all and every single one of you has a special place in my heart!

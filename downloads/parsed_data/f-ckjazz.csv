&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I am a graduate. It took me a while but I did
it, we all did it. The ceremony took forever, I got there at two and we
went through all the practice crap till about 5 when it started. I
actually got nervous when it was actually go time, Josh and i both did.
It was extreme, it's cool though that only last for a few minutes and
then I went to dinner with the Fam. <br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;THE PARTY:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The party was awesome I got there about 10:30
with my Guiness in hand and a tummy aching for it. I do not exactly
recall how much I drank but I know it was enough, enough that I was
booty dancing and doing the robot. It turns out I love to dance and
party! I think in all that people that showed up there was about 80 or
so by the end of the night. So many people I wouldn't expect to show up
did, I was really surprised by Lisa and that girl I work with. I had a
grand old time I can't wait to do it agian like next weekend or
something I am not sure when, I may just go and get drunk on my own. I
think I may be an alcholic, but that's story for a different day and

4) what do you want to do before you go to the navy?<br>
Go bank to New Orleans and just have an opportunity to say good by to everyone.<br>
5) if you could change something that has happened in your life, what would it be?<br>

"event","Well I am done with High School. For the past 13 years, I have had a routine and now it stops it's kind of interesting but it is human nature to adjust, Darwinism could come into play on this one. Evolve and thrive or regress and fail. My last day was this past Friday and I now look forward to Thursday and the  Star Wars premiere. I kinda wish ""She"" was still around I really enjoyed going to the movies with her, oh well such is life. Funny thing we had a talk about a week or so ago I don't know exactly, it was sorta strange that we had the same thing to say to eachother either way it's been said and I don't feel as scattered. After that I have graduation to look forward to. I don't know if I am excited or not, I do not feel excited I just want it to get here so I can get it over with. I need to talk to Patrick about the locale of the Graduation party. Funny story we had one last year and it wasn't even our graduation I guess this mean we can go all out with this one. I am so tired, I think I will take a nap. I think Miss Aliff and I should hang out sometime this week, I dubt that will happen since she has finals and the such. I'll probably just hang out until Thursday. Well I hope to see everyone at the graduation. A lot of this may not make sense but I am very tired and I just wanted to put some thoughts on this."

"event","""Ignorance is bliss and Knowledge is a curse.""
  That's the saying that I go by sometimes. Look at children for years they can be told that Santa Clause is real and that the tooth fairy gives them money in exchange for teeth. That is ignorance, but only because they do not know anything but what is told to them. They then find out that these things aren't real or that they can never be super heroes or anyother dream of their will not come to fruition. There in lies the curse. I never did believe in Santa I knew of him from the TV specials and friends but I could never get myself to believe.
  There are times when I wish I didn't know things, times when I could totally forget things that I learned. Ignorance is truly bliss look at Adam and Eve. They were merry and gay until their fall into temptation. They became knowledgeable of what they had done and became ashamed. Like I said I hate that I know certain things. Knowing certain things really skews your perception of things from what it may have been prior. I know I can never stop knowing things I don't want to know but maybe I will find better ways to deal with them.
  I can't wait till Star Wars Episode III premieres, I am so pumped I'll be there with my lighter sabre spoon from my Corn Pops."

I did buy the Wildboyz Season 2, Jessica expressed interest in coming over and watching it so all i have to do is get a day off when she has one. Speaking of days off I now have Thursday off until July when I leave. I still do not know what is going on this Thursday that is if we are doing Trivia night or ""The Show."" On a totally different note, we had our senior rec day Friday that was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I didn't win anything but that was cool. I did enjoy a tasty burger and tasty beverage. I think I am going to go back to cleaning my room, I started saturday afternoon and at this rate it will be done saturday of next month."

should be asleep the paper said to get plenty of rest, but WildBoyz is
on and I am staying up till 2 to watch both episodes that I have
already seen. I love this show. I bought some orange juice today to
take to school. I have been taking weird stuff to school, Monday and
Friday I had milk and cookies in Human A&amp;P. I can be rather
abstract... Back to the blood drive, they give you juice but probably
just a small cup, I say if a little juice is good than a lot should be
better. That theory is pretty bogus, I just really like orange juice. <br>
&nbsp;The play opens on Thursday and as of the end of Tuesday the set
is still not 100% complete I would say it is closer to 90%. 90% is
still good but 100% needs to be achieved, I like going into the theatre
it's fun not doing anything sometimes. Just so that everyone is aware
this is probably going to be one of those rambling entries. <br>
&nbsp;I think I am one of those people that only want things when one
can't have them, this could be one of those flawed character traits of
mine. HA! me flawed, that is a good one. ""LOL."" Though in all seriousness maybe I do actually want it this time, more so than last time anyway. Perhaps I have grown up since the first time.<br>
&nbsp;I can't wait for the new Halo 2 maps, yes I am a nerd and I play
video games. Most find it kind of endearing. I guess admiring
technology makes me a nerd, I love technology and science. I was
reading Men's Health Monday and I found this nifty little article about
the ""<a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,145754,00.html"">Gay gene</a>""
read this article I would get more into it but I just don't want to
right now. I wish&nbsp; Miss A could come to New Orleans she would love
it, it rocks so freaking much. I think she would probably enjoy the
French Quarter a lot. There are a lot of little shops and stands
selling nifty things, maybe when I go back I will buy people things. I
bet in the summer Vitamin P and I will spend more time there. This is
the end of our story, I think today Wednesday I will come home and play
video games I need to practice that or go and buy a new I think I broke
this one.<br>"

-""Love Song"" By 311 the original Cure song doesn't really do anything
-""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps"" by Doris Day and Cake that song also makes me upset
-""Ten Things I Hate About You"" That movie I have mixed feelings about I like it but I just can't ever sit down and watch it, it is pretty difficult.
-New Years Eve, I am not really a fan of that day it just seems bland. I if I could repeat my favorite one than it would be great.
-Brocolli, only unsalted brocolli any other kind is fine.
-This Bra I find everytime I clean out my drawers.
==My brain, sometimes I wish I could just find the parts that hold this information and wipe them our and replace them with other thoughts like of me skydiving or something==

Fourth period I had a test that I didn't even attempt, I think I did one question. I have just lost my desire to do anything, like you all read in the previous post I even lost my will to live. Sometimes I just want to go to some mountain and set up camp there and never come back like that book, ""My side of the Mountain.""

  I started getting sick Wednesday and I just got better yesterday. I was in bed all Wednesday, Thursday I went back to school and felt like crap. Friday I felt a lot better I took some meds with me to school in my pocket and I felt better. That night I was going to go to The Chariot show but I just wasn't up for it. I was up for killing myself that night though, not because I really wanted to but I think all the medicines in me caused the reaction. I kept saying to myself I should go down stairs and get that gun there to do it, it would be easy but luckily I was to exhausted to do so. The medicine eventually wore off and then I was back to normal, so don't think that I am some basket case that wants attention for killing myself. I even had a note written out in my head, I was going to type it here and then save another to my computer incase I no one ever read it on here. There was a message for just about everyone. I hate being sick, I talked to my uncle he brought the movie SAW over to watch. We watched it and then i asked him have you ever been so sick that you just want to shoot yourself not even with the cure for what you have but with something greater that will just take ALL of the pain away. I think he thinks I am physcho or something along the lines I don't blame him I would too.
  Will, Dayne, Jeremy, and I went to go see ""Cursed."" That is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies I would rather watch ""Maid in Manhatten"" than that crap fest wait never mind I would rather see ""Cursed."" I didn't really take into account how bad that movie was, okay so it wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen. 
  I just realized that I really have no reason to write in this. The person helped start this never reads it and I never talk to her anymore. The person who I used to communicate through comments doesn't comment anymore.(BAD SENTENCE) She was the main reason I would write in this just to keep her updated on what was going on but like I said she doesn't comment anymore so there really isn't any reason for me to keep writing in this, so I guess what I am trying to say is that this is probably my last post."

   Today was pretty interesting well not really, I did get to finish the ""The Bridge"" after about 10 changes had to be made from the original contract. I get to build the models now, there is something to rub in Andrea's face. Second period we just had busy work I only did half of it I wasn't in the mood for busy work especially graphs on supply and demand. In Human A&P we continued with our notes and worksheets I on the other hand decided to do my Alegebra III work instead, it turns out if I don't do that much work my grades tend to rise. Let me explain: Michael has been doing his work and getting pretty good grades on assignments I on the other hand rarely do homework much less turn it in, I do ""okay"" on the tests and such and my grade has gone up two points I know not a lot but more than Michael's his hasn't moved. Lisa and I are friends again we fixed our little rift today in Algebra. I am done talking about school.

   On a different note, I have been having thoughts about this girl (not Lisa) let's call her ""A."" I have known ""A"" for a while. I think I have feelings for her I don't know why I would, her and I don't really talk that often, I only see her on occasion and when I do talk to her it is only a few words and then we go our ways and that's that. I am always left with these feelings telling me that I should tell her that I at least have an interest in her but like I said her and I aren't really that close so I am afraid that will just freak her out and push her away even further. I do not really have a plan on what I want to do about this, I probably won't do anything but who knows.

   I am debating on whether I should enter that Halo 2 tourney, I would like I to. I know I am no where near  Ace of 5pades level. I probably will just to meet some people and have some fun. It is only like 7 dollars on a saturday afternoon or night I am not really that sure but I'll ponder that a little longer."

build a model of it and test after which I should be done and
construction can begin early next week or sometime at the end of this
week.<br>

"event","The Aliffs are a fun bunch, I was there this past Sunday and I rather enjoyed their company. I should be going over there tomorrow so hopefully the same level of fun will be present. The party this weekend Danni's and the other one. I'll probably end up going to the other one just because I'll know more people there I don't think they have decided whether it's going to be a Toga party or what. Did someone say king of the mountain...mountain...mountain. Well I am probably off to go and work on that fun Econ homework, that is the worst class I have ever been in. I fell asleep twice in that class so did Amanda and I for sure bombed the test we had today. I know nothing about Demand elasticity or the what not. I got a another bomb today, it turns out I will be responsible for the design of the bridge that will be used for the upcoming play Les Miserable. I have a mere 10 days to design, test, and contract a build team. I can do it, if I can design a house and a an air boat I think I can build a working bridge. Like stated earlier I am off to do that wonderful econ homework and just remembered I have that Algerbra III work to that shouldn't be too difficult.

6 months this friday."

This part of post is for my part. It turns out I really like my hair, I
didn't used to like my hair but I do now. Anyway I had a pretty
eventful weekend. I went to Athens (THE A TOWN) on Friday I got back on
Sunday afternoon around 2. We were on the sleds and shot fireworks and
I was drunk for about 30 hours, amazing. I never thought I could drink
that much but when the guy down the way has a keg in his front lawn
it's hard not to. A bunch of stuff happend not just sledding, booze,
fireworks, and pot but I won't bore anyone with all this stuff. I like
the carpet at the Aliff's and I hate Subway because they didn't have
meatballs. Damnit!<br>"

"event","It's around 1:10 in the a.m. I just finished watching a movie on IFC. This is just to set a scene for why I am writing in this so late. I am not strung out on coke or anything I just happened to take a nap this evening and I am full of energy. I just realized I have a test in my Human A&P class tomorrow, I'll do well I have to it's one of my favorite classes that and Algebra III who ever thought that math would be one of my favorite courses.

This is what I really want to talk about, I walked into my mother's bedroom and she was folding socks while my little brother walked around the bed. He's almost got the walking thing down. He walks around the bed and he crawls around the house, he is beginning to worry I have to worry about him falling down the stairs. I see him smile everyday. I see his little teeth poking out and it brings me so much joy, joy like I haven't felt in a long time. My mother said, ""he smiles everytime he sees you."" I just responded to that with a smile of my own, yes I can smile it's not impossible for me to I do a have a heart. (YOU KNOW THAT)
I don't really have much to say I was just thinking about that throughout the whole movie. I thought about my brother, that still sounds a little strange I have a brother I never thought I would ever have one. I want to go to sleep so I will even though I want to talk about this some more it is really not all that important. My feet are getting cold and I want to curl up in my warm bed and sleep for a few hours before school starts. Ahh school back to school I go. School School School.

Miss Aliff you happen to read I hope you feel well enough to call me later when I get home around 5 or 6ish I don't know whenever."

"event","Your birthday was almost two weeks ago, why are you bringing it up now. I did not forget we talked about during that whole talk about New Years. I just didn't want to call and then get the whole, ""hey, can I call you back later"" response. Either way Happy Birthday and sorry I wasn't there, I promise I will wish you a happy birthday until I can wish no more. :)

Just found out like two days ago that Mom is sending me to Europe this summer before I leave for the Navy. It's freakin' awesome and my uncle asked me to go the the dunes this summer also. It's going to be weird not being around everyone, this is all really surreal, but that's what ""Leave"" is for. It is still hard to believe back in ninth grade I would not have been able to imagine all the things that have happened to me, both good and bad. I always wanted a life in the military ever since I was eleven years old, but then I wanted a ""keg cooler"" but we all know how that one worked out so now I am back to the military life. I have a feeling this is going to be a great opportunity for me and hopefully I can set a good example for my brother, he's one of the main reason I wanted to do this. I want him to look up to his older brother with pride, I don't want him to fall to the temptations of mediocrity. I know this all sounds sappy and dumb but it is true, I'm not claiming that what I have done or am doing is a great feat, I just want him to surpass me in his achievements. These are just the ramblings of a crazy man, most of these sentences aren't even formatted correctly and who knows how many words I've misspelled. I'm ending this now with a simple:

I don't really care tol tell the truth, that' not what i am going to talk about about. what i am going to talk about tonight is how somethings cost more money than they should. I  was looking at my phone this evening and said to myself, ""self, wouldnt it be cool if you could connect your cell phone to your computer?"" My phone is the Motorola V400 a very nice phone my favorite so far...besides Erica's oh my goodness that is an awesome phone. Back to my dilema Charli has the Motorola V220 which came out after mine but has a lower number which is kinda strange at least it is to me. Her phone has a USB port which probably means you can connect it to your PC which angers me to a great extent, because i have like 4 USB cables i am not using that would fit in it. The money issue comes into play here, i have buy a cable for mine and it comes with software which is nice but i have to pay 59.99 for it and that is reDICKalous. It's makes me mad!! Either way my phone is better than charli's, it has a bigger screen and better battery life. so I rather have that the connectivity issue. AND so i step off my soap box and i am off to retire to my bed."

It's about 2 am right now and I think i am watching Trading Spaces, i think ive seen the same episode like 3 times already. I didnt really feel like doing anything tonight i think i got my computer working the way I want it to now. I shouldnt have to get it to work I just bought it in July so much for the 800 dollars spent aye? While at home i came across this television show that seemed to spark my interest, Radio Free Roscoe. This show is actually pretty good, it's on the N i believe. I think you should set some time and watch it, it is pretty interesting enough of that though i just had a memory. I wonder why they took that FEAR show off of Mtv, you know that one where they would send a bunch of 20 somethings into haunted places and make them do stuf in there, i remember the time they told some guy to bury the other guy in coffin.
  I was in the shower today and realized that I dont really need to do what I have been trying to do or been trying to convince myslef that I wanted to do. So my life is going to start anew.
  Turns out i'm tired now so im going to go and sleep for a few hours. I need someone..."

WE normally argue after about 2 or 3 minutes so the fact that this one lasted a whole 39 minutes and 34 seconds was incredible. Well it was up until the last 36 after that it all went downhill as the song goes. I told her how I felt and why I did somethings, she wanted to ask me something but didn't know what it was. I feel horrible, I dont know why I do i hate this feeling: my stomach aches and my body trembles i hate it. I know why I hurt though and it's not hate. I hurt more tonight than I ever wanted anyone in my life, I dont like hurting people. I dont like talking to her because afterwards I am left questioning my feelings and thoughts about things. I hate be me sometimes, like she said I am a big softy even though it may not look or act like it. She wanted to ask me something and in the course of the conversation she said I answered it, I wish I knew what it was, I won't sleep for days now. Sometimes I wish I could look to the future so i could organize my thoughts better, but that wouldnt be life and if it were like that it would be too easy.

Like i said last night I love watching movies, I dont want to disapoint I don't like disapointing people. People in general are fascinating creatures, we were watching Hamlet (the one with Mal Gibson) we came to the part where Hamlet was mounting Gertrude(Glenn Close) and was apparentling grinding her and I felt a little sick mainly because Gertrude is Hamlet's <b><i>MOTHER</i></b> GROSS. She then went on to plant this kiss on her son, and even though all of us in the class know they arent really related we still cringed when it happened. I found it interesting how we all fell into the reality of the movie we were so enthrawled by the story and characters that we were disgusted by this, odd wouldn't you say. I can't wait to go see Atreyu on Wednesday, i dont really understand the lyrics nor do i care for them i just like they're sound, it's expotastic(new word, it's mine you cant use it.)

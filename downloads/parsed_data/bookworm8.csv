"event","Well, the biggest news of the new year is that my sister, Mallory, suffered a miscarriage, a couple of weeks ago. At first, I was disappointed because I was just getting used to the idea of a niece or nephew . But I know she and her boyfriend are in, no way, ready for a baby. 

Work and school are the same. Life in the apartment is still cool. But right now, we are having a remodeling project going on right now. It involves a leaking pipe and water falling in the bathroom. Right now, the bathroom ceiling is exposed to the beams. It has to dry before they can fix it. 

But life is good.

I can't wait to see what the next two months will bring!"

"event","2005 has been an amazing and life changing year. 

April: first, the discovery that my mom is under investigation for fraud through her old job. Second, acceptance into a new college and the prospect of moving out on my own. Third, my sister, Mallory, moving back home with her fiance, Jason. 

May-July: my brother and I start making plans to move out: finding our apartment and stuff.

August: moving in and getting settled.

September: starting a new job, starting a new school, getting used to living out on my own

October-November: living in a routine, starting to really enjoy my new found freedom and independence. Brandon getting a new job that would bring more money in and we can finally get the big things we need for the apartment: sofa, refrigerator, etc.

December: the Christmas season: always filled with family drama and this year wasn't any different. I found out that my sister, Mallory, is pregnant. The baby's due in June.

All I can say is that I am glad that I am outside the situation this time. This doesn't really affect me directly, at least not day-to-day. I'll be an aunt and a support for my family but I am still outside and it fills me with a great sense of relief. With everything else that is going on, I don't know if I can handle anymore stress in my day-to-day life!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Today was my last day at Bedard Machine. It really didn't hit me until after lunch when I was doing last minute tasks and loading my personal stuff in my car.

It's really happening. I got a great lunch with my coworkers with pizza and a delicious cake! YUM!YUM!

I got a beautifully written card and a potted plant. My first plant for my new apartment. 

After loading my stuff in my car, I went to get my check and my friend, dailybird, mentioned that I looked sick. 

And I felt sick. Maybe it was the combination of the pizza, the sugar from the cake and the enormity of what I am doing finally sunk in.

It's finally happening! There's no going back now.

Saying to goodbye was easier that I thought. Considering that the owners are my aunt and uncle (so I'll eventually see them again) and my bestest, greatest friend is there and I'll definitely see her again. 

One of the machinist insisted of carrying one last box for me. The box with all my personal items. He was really sweet, gave me a hug, wished me luck and told me to visit.

My uncle walked in to my car and gave me one last encouraging advice and told me that if I needed anything to call him. I will, Uncle D, I will. 

Then, I got in my car and drove anyway for one last time. Sitting at the light, the tears came. It's really happening. 

I now must worry about me and living for me. I've been living for others for so long, it's very scary to think that the only person I needed to worry about is me. ME!"

"event","I've been very low for the past week but Thursday and FRiday afternoon brought me higher than I've been in a long time. 

First, Thursday I made a trip to San Bernardino to see my new school. It is such a beautiful area. The mountains are looming in the background and it has a country-middle of nowhere feel. 

Second, Friday afternoon was a day of great surprises. First, one of the apartment complexes I've been looking at, call me back and was very helpful. The apt will be affordable and perfect for me. But, first, I need to see the area that it is in before I make a decision. I was so excited that I started researching utilities, cable, etc. Then, I went and got the mail. I received a letter from the IRS. They had recaluated my taxes with my earned income credit and I got an additional $292 dollars!!!!! That money is going straight to my savings.

Other things still have me worried about these events made me realize that I am not alone and there is someone watching out for me!"

I have three new books and I have no desire to open one up and read. 
No laundry to do because my mom took it to my grandmother's. 
I guess I can get started on the housework. But I need to new belt for the vacuum. 
Homework isn't urgent. 

Its nice after a very full and busy week to have a empty and boring weekend, I guess."

So, I didn't feel like listening to a group of big babies complaining about anything. Besides, the baseball game is on tonight and the Red Soxs could take the World Series (which I hope they do. They are a really good team and deserve to win!).

I know its been a long, long, long time since my last journal, a couple months I think. So, I have time and decided that I could update it. I have nothing of value to say and nothing exciting to say. But for some reason, I'm not sure what people like to read my rabblings. 

Life is good. School is going great, I got a 100% on a Criminal Investigations test!!! Yeah, me! Work was good on Friday, even though someone, and I'm not naming names, was gone. I was basically pulled in every direction, someone needed this, someone needed that, plus my regular duties. It was great but I wouldn't want it to happen all the time. 

Now, it's Saturday, laundry is in the washer and the dryer. All major chores are done... It's going to be a long, nice weekend."

"event","I'm not sure why this is on my mind but...Families are the source of who we are and who we become in life. They can support us or bring us down. They can incite us to excel above and beyond their standards and expectations. I have two families. One family includes my mom, brother, my sister and my closet friends who love me and support me no matter what. They encourage me in my dreams and goals. When I said I wanted to go back to school to major in criminal justice and pursue a Ph.D. They said go for it. Even if it meant leaving them behind to go to school. They would do anything in their power to help me and I for them. It is because of them, I work and slave to be accomplish all that I dream of.
But my second family consists of people whom I am related to by blood or marriage and that is where the connection ends. They do not understand me or my dreams and goals. I'm not sure they even want to. I can hear their doubt in their voices when I discuss my plans. To them, a girl from a divorced family can not be a greater success than their own children. My family history is filled with hurt and betrayal. I know deep in my heart that they will not be a consist part of my life, I will never see some of these people again. To me that is fine. Because families do not intently hurt each other just because someone finally stuck up for themselves after months of verbal abuse and being taken advantage of. It is because of this family that I work and slave to accomplish all that I dream of. To quote one of my favorite authors, Patricia Cornwell, ""Survival was my only hope, success my only revenge."" This simple quote details so clearly my past, present and future. I will prove them all wrong. I've done it so far and I will continue to do so."

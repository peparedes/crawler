"event","When I was young, I used to really love an actor by the name of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000970/"" target=""new"">Jonathan Brandis</a>. At that age, I loved him before I knew what love was and on the simple basis that he was beautiful. Hell, at that age, I thought I'd grow up and marry him or something. I'd seen him in a fair few things on television and always hoped to see more.

Lastnight, someone told me he had commit suicide some time last year. He had died in 2003 at the age of 26, apparently, he'd hung himself. I can't help but feel really sad about this because that's another piece of my childhood/teenage years gone, regardless of whether it's stupid or superficial. And I had been waiting for him to appear in another film all this time. 

Wherever he is now, I hope that he finds the happiness he couldn't find in life.

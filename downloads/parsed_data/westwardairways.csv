"event","i had a dream and everything changed.

i woke up and i was a different man. my head had changed, my heart had changed.

you were there and everything changed. scenes from a movie played out in brief, and i knew this was a chance worth taking. and i had resolved to take more chances.

so now i'm running headlong down a road and i don't know where it leads. that's what chances are, though.

and when i look at you and say a few words about taking that chance, and you say ""you should"", i throw hesitation out the fucking window.

i'm taking a chance, and everything has changed. if this will build me or break me, only time will tell.

all i know is

*i haven't been this happy in __________.
*everything changed."

"event","change is a snowdrift
a wind shift
a handshake
and you and i are pressured
directed
and bound

so open the window to let out the noise
and sleep in to hide from the folks you'll avoid
and then wake for me
i'll wait for you
and open your heart to the noise you let out
let it circle right through you to wash out the doubt
and then stay with me
i'll still wait for you

change is a snowdrift
a season
a wave
and you and i are building
and shifting
and rising

so write me a letter then throw it away
just a way to rehearse everything that you'll say
when you say to me
""i willl wait for you""
this wasn't the plan, but then life never is
and that's half the enjoyment, three-quarters the bliss
on the way with you
worth the wait for you"

"event","i've always had a hard time with resolutions. they seem, by design, to fall flat right out of the gate. but i do want to take a minute and write out, if only for myself, things i have planned for 2009.

i'm currently holding a legal pad with 2 pages of places i have applied to just in the past 3 days or will apply to in the next day or two. the list will grow, more time will be spent filling out ridiculous applications. at least one of these places will call me, and they won't be able to interview me without wanting to hire me. all of this tedious, boring, mind-numbing work will pay off with a new job that will pay my bills and then some.

said job will allow me to save at least 5% of my income while i am paying all of my bills on time. these saved moneys will go into a Roth IRA.

my photography business will become a real, legitimate, recognized by the IRS business. it will have a name and taxes and maybe an employee besides myself within the next couple of years.

i plan on getting back into school this year, probably in the fall, and most likely at SLCC. if a decent amount of my credits will transfer, i'd like to finish my accounting degree. this will help me to get a higher paying job while building my photography business. if my credits will just be laughed at, i might take a look at my other options.

i'm also going to put forth effort to dress less like i'm stll in high school.

not much, just a little.

this is a pretty boring post, i'll admit. so here's a <a href=""http://daytrotter.com/article/1346/kaki-king"">treat for your ears</a>."

<b>+ rp crit</b>

I'm <i>just</i> getting back into fandom rp so crit is appreciated. There are crit posts up in all of my character journals, so you can either bring up any issues you have there or here. If you have a problem with any of my original characters, you bring them up here too.

Alternatively! If you want something like a log or a specific thread/plot, feel free to poke me about one here. I love doing that sort of thing <strike>even if 99% of the time I'm too nervous to ask</strike>. &hearts;

<b>+ personal issues</b>

I like to think I'm a fairly agreeable person, but the way I see myself can be radically different from the way others view me. If you have an issue with me, please tell me here and I'll do my best to correct my behaviour.

"event","RP meme stolen from mc<lj user=""birdzilla"">. Using a lot of the newer characters SO THAT I CAN GET A BETTER FEEL FOR THEM. And also, mainly only characters from the past year because I suck and lost all my old logs. :(

1) Bernard (WHO GETS INTO EVERYTHING, I SWEAR)
2) Henry Patrickson
3) Ella Leroy
4) Helga Louie
5) Tristram Conall
6) Myra Lethe
7) Ry

<lj-cut text=""it gets long"">
<b>What do you do with them?</b>
Roleplaying.

<b>Do you feel close to them?</b>
Yeaaah. I feel for them and sometimes I even feel guilty when I set them up for horrible, horrible falls (...oh Henry/Heritage!firstgen!Myra). And sometimes it feels like their attitudes influence mine - if I play a happy/aspirational character in the morning, I feel happy all day.

<b>Do you believe they're real?</b>
That thought made my eyes water. No.

<b>Are any of them dating each other?</b>
Nope, although Ry and Ella would get on. I-I mean apart from the whole ""ten year age gap"" thing, they'd get on.

<b>Have any of them ever been killed?</b>
No, but I can see it happening.

<b>Have you drawn them?</b>
All the time. I'm a dork, I know.

-

<b>About number one:</b>
Bernard is one of these goofy characters I like to reuse. He goes through a certain amount of personality changes depending upon which rp he is <i>in</i> and what world it <i>is</i> (for instance, he's a lot more likely to be smart-but-a-little-doofie in a modern day game then he is in a fantasy setting) but remains an utter tall dork.

<b>What do they do for a living?</b>
Usually a student - um, a fail!cavalier was his latest job. HE DOESN'T USUALLY WORK.

<b>What do they dress like?</b>
Indie boy chic in the latest modern game - I used <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etcKVXsuk_o"">Jamie T</a> as the PB, so there was lots of SHAGGY HAIR and BAD TEETH and jeans + t-shirts +jackets, oh my! Fantasy, it'll fit whatever his job is at the time - usually it'll be some imitation of a knight's costume.

<b>Who is their best friend?</b>
Recently? Modern? Um, he wanted to look after and take care of Isa but that was because HOLY SHIT PREGNANT GIRL D: and also the negative vibes he got from her put him in a bad mood. So making her happy makes him happy, yes? Recent fantasy game? Um, Alix was his gay bff, really.

<b>How would they respond to abuse?</b>
Fighting back. >:(

<b>Do they have any nicknames?</b>
Bernieeeeee. Bern.

<b>Are they seeing anyone? Married?</b>
HAHAHAAA fuck no.

<b>What species are they?</b>
Always human.

<b>Do they eat meat?</b>
VEGETARIANISM IS FOR THE WEEEEAAAAK

<b>What kind of accent do they have?</b>
Depends.

--

<b>About number two:</b>
Henry is a sweet, idealistic young man who genuinely believes that optimism is the best policy and that people really can do anything if they try. He's serious, and tries hard to do his best with <i>everything, ever</i> to impress people. However, he's full of anxieties and tends to mess things up. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I AM GENERALLY ENJOYING WORKING OUT NEW WAYS TO BREAK HIS SPIRIT.

<b>What's their middle name?</b>
He made up his last name, he might as well make up a middle one. He'd probably pick out a really pretty, feminine one though.

<b>How old are they?</b>
Only just seventeen.

<b>What's their favourite hobby?</b>
""...What's a hobby?"" Henry trains, studies and sometimes writes on the journals. He doesn't make time for a hobby - he's too busy trying to be the best.

<b>What's their sexuality?</b>
AMBIGUOUS. He's very much a child when it comes to these things. He doesn't like physical closeness and boobs scare the hell out of him. However, the idea of having sex with a <i>man</i> also scares him. Maybe he'll work it out one day.

<b>Any special powers?</b>
Magic optimism power make-up. He's...going to attempt to learn magic. And going to attempt to learn swords.

<b>What religion are they?</b>
Funnily enough, despite being Isaacian, he believes in the Lenster doctrine. It could be said it's something to do with preferring his Lenstern mother over his Isaacian father, but really it's just cause he thinks the Lenster creation myth is far more beautiful than the others. One day, he wants to find someone and be the Thesan to their Tiur and ease their loneliness and sorrow. 

...Yeah, we're both dorks, shove it.

<b>Do they get ridiculed?</b>
Often.

<b>What species are they?</b>
Human/Beorc.

<b>Who are their friends?</b>
...Nobody but Helga Louie and that's just 'cause he used to babysit her son, and she's stalking his father. Milk, in future maybe? But he might be a bit too hung-up on the whole ""YOU USED TO TEASE ME WHEN I WAS LITTLE D: D: D:"" thing. 

<b>Have they ever wanted to kill someone?</b>
Nope. And considering he's a soldier...

---

<b>About number three:</b>
Ella Leroy is an angry English Lit student who has the worst superpowers in the universe (I wrote in my notes: ""Anything she sketches she can will to life, but there are limitations. Anything brought to life is the same size as the drawing they were brought to life from and their quality matches her own lack of ability as an artist (so, stick men instead of real people, and lop-sided animals, that sort of thing). Also, her power has a tendency to fluctuate with her stress level, meaning when she is upset she does it with ease and when she is at peace it's almost impossible. This power is a double edged sword which leaves her with severe migraines."" but I think I could probably find a way to explain it better, l-lulz.). She's never been around anyone with powers before, so she's always a little nervous and vulnerable around them.

<b>What color is their hair?</b>
Blonde. 

<b>What is their ethnicity?</b>
White/English.

<b>What is their favorite food?</b>
Salad, yays.

<b>Do they have a nice singing voice?</b>
She does like music, but I somehow doubt it.

<b>Have they ever hurt someone?</b>
Not on purpose. :<

<b>Are they a virgin?</b>
Probably: she's another social retard.

<b>Are they single?</b>
Yep, which led to great hilarity when a giant dragon in human form started mackin' on her.

...Fuck, I miss that game.

----

<b>About number four:</b>
Helga is a cheerful, warm Isaacian. And an awesome mage who will electrocute a bitch if they dare touch either her son or her little sisters (...Mike, Justin, Nathan, Nina). She's booksexual and horribly short-sighted. She's also my favourite Heritage character and I NEED TO PLAY HER.

<b>Are they male or female?</b>
Female, but a little androgynous.

<b>What is their favorite color?</b>
Purple! Or light blue! Or lavender! She likes anything from that range, really.

<b>Who is their worst enemy?</b>
Helga has no enemies. Maybe someone who really hates books? I don't even know if Loputous counts, since she might even join up if she thinks he'll keep her family safe.

<b>What sort of clothes do they wear?</b>
Shirt (unironed), skirt (probably unironed), glasses (probably broken), cloak (probably needs patching). Fuck, Helga you are thirty-five stop dressing like a teenager akasjksa.

<b>Where are they from?</b>
Tilnanogue in Isaac, same as Henry. I LIKE TILNANOGUE OK.

<b>Are they in a relationship?</b>
She's utterly asexual. 

<b>What would they do if they were held at gunpoint?</b>
She would thunderstorm herself a bitch. Simple as that. You really don't want to threaten Helga or her loved ones. :|

-----

<b>Number five:</b>
Tris is a thief who is trying to make enough money for his baby sister to have a good life, while at the same time learning that he needs to let go of her and let her lead her own life at some point. Thanks to this brat, I can no longer listen to ""books from boxes"" again.

<b>Are they magic in any way?</b>
Normal beorc here. :[

<b>What religion are they?</b>
Heeee's aware of the Draconism doctrine but doesn't care too much for religion. He dislikes the holy bloodlines and those in power because of this resentment he has towards anyone in authority. And as far as he's concerned, Draconism is just a way for the holy bloodlines to continue holding onto power HE'S A PRETTY DEEP KID. 

<b>Do they have any kids?</b>
...He's fifteen. 

<b>Has anyone close to them ever died?</b>
His mother and father have both been killed violently. I dunno what happened to Rustam (his teacher) but it's only too possible that he's been killed as well/had a hand chopped off for thieving. As far as Tristram is concerned, Rustam is dead. He has to believe this, even if it hurts, because otherwise he knows he'd go crazy trying to find the man and free him.

<b>If they were an animal, what would they be?</b>
Kitten!

<b>What sort of TV programs do they like?</b>
He'd probably enjoy comedy programs like Mock the Week and Nevermind the Buzzcocks. Maybe the Catherine Tate show.

<b>What is their fondest memory?</b>
Once, when he was really small, he spent an hour teaching his sister how to make perfect snow angels. Then, their father, back from work, came out to play with them, and they had a huge snowball fight which ended with them all wrestling in the snow. Later, they built huge snowmen to ""protect"" their home. When they finally got back in, it was night and their mother had laid on a huge supper for them all. And Tristram could pretend for a while that they were a normal family. And that everything would be all right after all.

------

<b>Number six:</b>
Ex-mage and mage-botherer, Myra has found herself working for the family business - and hating it, no matter how good she is at it. Right now, she's looking for an escape - from her job, from Freege, from her family, from Grandbell. 

<b>What number would represent them?</b>
Four. It's the number of letters in ""Fail"".

<b>Where are they from?</b>
<strike>When a mummy and a daddy love each other very much-</strike> Freege, Grandbell.

<b>Do they consider themselves pretty?</b>
She doesn't really think about her looks. She's always been considered young-looking, and cute in a childish way. No one's ever called her pretty, or beautiful.

<b>How often do they sleep?</b>
lolinsomniac. She doesn't sleep much because she gets nightmares. And also because she has problems lying still for too long. She does <i>get</i> sleep when she really needs it. Usually from collapsing into a chair or napping in one the shop's back rooms um.

<b>Do they daydream?</b>
Daydreams or doodles depending on how bored she is. One day I really need to post the ""five things Myra has doodled into her notebook"" thing I've got.

<b>What is their sexuality?</b>
Straighter than a ruler.

<b>Do they have any hobbies?</b>
<strike>Booze and hookers.</strike> <strike>Making Lions trauma face.</strike> <strike>Mage bothering.</strike> NOPE, NONE AT ALL.

-------

<b>Number seven:</b>
Ry is <i>cute</i> and purely a pacifist. Unless he's being horribly annoyed by <i>someone</i> close to him, in which case he must rain down justice in the form of a healing rod to the fucking head.

<b>Do they like being outdoors?</b>
He doesn't really know anything else. He doesn't really feel anything towards either of the options. A bed's a bed, right?

<b>What's their personality like?</b>
Happy, usually pretty smiley and goofy. A little unsure of himself and his place in the world. All he wants to do is heal the hurt of others.

<b>Do they hate anyone?</b>
It is impossible for him to hate anyone.

<b>Do they have a crush? Who?</b>
...Do you remember what I said above about raining down justice on someone near and dear to him who is an idiot? :D/-\

<b>Are they intelligent?</b>
Average intelligence."

"event","So, I'm putting this back up, and any questions about my role playing can be directed here. 

THERE WERE OTHER RPS HERE BUT THEN THEY DIED. D8 <- me.

In <lj user=""Heritage_rpg"">

<lj-cut text=""My d00ds"">

<b>Patrick:</b>

Alright, I'll admit it. I'm having a bit of a problem finding Paddy's voice and that's why he posts so rarely. I haven't had the chance to interact with many people yet and he just looks like a strange, sort of benevolent, eccentric dude. 

To be honest, I find him a bit boring. I can't think of anything to do with him anymore, but occasionally I do get wild flashes of <strike>stupidity</strike> inspiration and he posts. I don't want to get rid of him because I am rather fond of the dude. I just don't know what to do with him.

I don't know what I'm going to do with the bird he found. I was going to have it be an eagle or a bird of prey like that, but I think I might have it be a chicken instead, or a duck. 

<b>Myra Lethe:</b>

Who am I kidding? Myra is my main character. I like writing her lines, and I love the way somebody as smart as she is can be so moronic. The problem is, she sometimes forgets her place in the food chain and can come close to trouble. However, she can have brilliant flashes of insight. 

I like the little brat the way she is, but it would be awesome if something happened to make her sober up and become more mature. 

She's being a little emo at the moment. She feels like nothing she does will ever be as good as what big brother does, and has the sinking feeling that he'll only really acknowledge her if she can make a name for herself independent of him. So that is what she's trying to do now. 

She comes across as a little sue-ish, doesn't she? 8D

<b>Helga Louie:</b>

I don't have much to write here now. I've only just started to play her. I'm having a little trouble with her voice, but hopefully that'll sort itself out within the next few threads. It's nothing important. I just feel a niggle in the back of my mind when I write her, like ""Am I doing this right?"" ""Is that really what she'd say?"". It was one of the reasons I was taking so long when threading on the entrance post. 

And the user name and the surname make up two little references. Tiny references. Did anybody except me and the two other people I found on teh interwebs ever watch Rune Soldier? 

Well, the main character was a really incompetent mage in training called Louie. See, he's why I gave her that surname. Then there was my favourite quote liek evar from him: ""Ahem. WITH MY AWESOME MAGICAL POWERS-!"" There you go, there's the user name, awesomemagic. 

Yeah, those were rubbish. I know. Shut up.</lj-cut>

So, recently the idea of a second generation game where we play our character's kids was brought up in <lj user=""heritage_ooc"">.

<b>Patrick's kiddy</b>: I've always sort of planned to have Patrick become an author of books about knights and stuff like that when he gets older - and his kids would probably be really geeky readers. They'd probably be mercenaries or something. I can see him wanting them to grow up to be powerful sword fighters. I know that if I did play them, I'd use Gremio from Suikoden as the PB. Mostly because when I was playing it with my youngest brother he leaned over pointed at Gremio and shouted ""That's Patrick!"" and pointed to some pictures of Paddy in my sketchbook.

<b>Helga</b>: Would be an awesome aunt. Fo' rizzle. Or if she did have kids, she'd be a bit over-protective, a bit mother-hen like. After the past I've given her, I doubt she'd want to let the kiddy-winks out of her sight. They'd probably be molly-coddled and wimpy. You know, the ""My MOM thinks I'm cool!"" guys. 

<b>Myra</b>: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I can't imagine anyone being with Myra long enough to grow remotely fond of her, let alone love her. Good thing you don't have to like someone to sleep with them <strike>or she'd never get laid</strike>! I can see her having a drunken one-night stand, getting pregnant then dropping the baby off at the nearest orphanage as soon as possible. The child would grow up to be sweet tempered, mild, modest and perhaps a little insecure. I am, however, sort of horrified at the thought of who'd be the father. 

...Now I want to write out her relationships. They'd be <i>train wrecks.</i> Awesome train wrecks! But still train wrecks."

"event","So I haven't been on in a while but I thought I would say hi.
It has been a busy semester.
Studying hard, working hard.
So it looks like i am going to have 3 A and 2 B's but one of those Bs might be an A
Yeah I love good grades. Just have to make sure that I study super hard for my last
 2 test and I will do okay. 
So I have been working really hard at work and apparently I am outworking everyone else
 so Wendy is talking about slowing stopping working so she can be home with the kids more.
 She said that She will start training me to be manager of the store. Definitly is good for
 the ol resume.
This semester I have made a lot of really good close friends. It is very exciting.
Enrique, little brown Ella, and I doing really well. I love my honey."

For ladies that go to planned parenthood or any public clinic for yearly checkups and that little pill, we call pill. President Bush is trying to shut that down. He is trying to force Abstinence only teaching into schools. Do you know what this could mean. More and more babies born without the proper healthcare. More people having to live off welfare. No place for safe, affordable abortions for pregnant women. Or for that matter, safe affordable prenatal care for woman.

If he really wanted to protect teens, he would fund the kind of comprehensive, age-appropriate and medically accurate sexual health education that is proven to reduce rates of sexually transmitted infection, unintended pregnancy and abortion. The only thing that will decrease with more abstinence-only education is the safety of our teens.""

I believe that a women as a right to choose, obviosly I did not choose abortion but under other circumstances I may have. Every one has that right. Before anyone says "" I would never have an abortion under any circumstance"", don't. You dont know what you would do unless you were in that circumstance. What if you were raped? What if the baby has a terminal illness? What if you were to die if trying to carry it to full term? What if you cannot finacially bring a baby into this world and raise it that you think it should be raised. Before you say adoption,how do you know that that is right for you. I can honestly tell you that is one of the hardest things that you could ever choose. No matter what the decision is it is a hard decision to make. All the options need to be there in order for you to do what you need to do. If abortion is taken away, the procedure s will still be given. They just wont be safe, regulated and they would highly expensive.

For instance last night when I went to chapter I felt kinda like nobody really wanted me there and it was a sad and disheartening. I dont know if that is how people really felt or not but it is just the way i felt. It could have been that I was tired from Canton and I probably shouldnt go anyways. I just came home upset and I kept getting irritated at Enrique for no reason at all. And all those emotions just continued today.
I am also kinda upset by something else. I also have this other friend that was one the greatest friends i ever had.I have loved him dearly ever since we came to school together. Every time I seem to be able to get the chance to talk to him his girlfriend always seems to pop up and be like we need to go here or you need to do this and that. My friendship with this person is fizzling and he is honestly one of the few people that I feel would love me as a friend and as a person no matter what. He is a person who i have always been able to be completly honest with and vice versa. It seems to have been getting a whole lot worse lately.
22 more days till I get to see Autumn. Yeah!"

 Anyways things are going good. I now have more steady hours at work. Good because i have more steady money coming in and i am not hoping and praying that it will be a little bit more than i actually think it is so that i can buy groceries.
 
 It has been an amazing week. I found out that I get to see Autumn for Thanksgiving. Yay! I cant wait to see little autumn and see how much she has grown. They invited us to a resprt in Wisconnsin. I was a little scared to say yes at firstr because I thought I would be meeting all of their family and that is a scaryt thing. A good majority of people think that birthparents are horrible people. It scares me tho think that these people could be smiling in my face and hating me all at the same time. But they said that there wasnt going to be a bunch of relatives. I was also scared that it was going to be lots and lots of money but it turned out not to be as much as i thought it would be. Yeah! I hope that we are able to get all the things that we need done done by then."

"event","Poem for McKenna

When they placed you in my arms
My world changed
from Dark
to light.
I never knew a mother's love
Until I looked into your eyes.
Your smile and laugh heal me now
And i remember your every detail.
Although many criticize and misunderstand
I know your in the best of hands.
I did what I did because I wanted 
you to know laughter and peace,
And never to know futility,
The coldness of a hungry night. 
I loved you enough to give you life
But now I know that was all I could give.
You have a mother, who's so good to you,
Who loves you enough and can give you more.
I wanted so much to give you
That I couldn't take anything less.
For you there should be ribbons and bows
And play and love
And hugs galore.
You came from me 
But now are hers
And always will be a part of them.
Although my thought s are so much with you
I wanted to give you so much more than me.
I hope one day you'll understand it all
And smile at how lucky you are.
There is a God who loves you so
And I thank him everyday
For giving you such a good warm home
And never letting you suffer alone.


Ilove my little Autumn and I will never forget her."

"event","So I got a call from sister earlier tonight. She had some ""exciting"" news. She saw Mrs. Bedo, an ex boyfriend's mother. This is not just any ex but the only ex that i still have postive feeling towards. There was sad news and news that makes me ponder. The first bit of news is that Andrew is being shipped to Iraq at the end of August. How sad and how anguished this makes me feel. This bit of news makes the war seem so much more of a reality to me. I hope and pray that God will keep him safe. The second bit of news is Andrew is married now to a girl that I was good friends with while i was in high school during the period that we were dating. Someone I never would imagine him with. I can't really explain how i feel about that. I am not jealous. It is almost as if i am numb to it and not completely understanding it. It makes me wonder if my relationship with Enrique is going to be taken to the next level. I wish I knew where we were going and maybe i would actually have a true happiness for this couple, but i am so lost and confused about my own life that i don't know how to feel happy for them. can anyone explain this. I sure can't. Please give mesome words of wisdom."

I think i saw John's eyes tear up but i am not to sure because I didn't have my classes. Cathy was a picture perfect Bride. I am so happy for the new Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd. Congrats you guys and I hope you have fun in Vegas."

"event","So I went to my friends bacholorette party, and we had a great time. I meet a few new super cool people. So all this made me wonder -  why don't girls hang out with just one another everyonce in a while. We had so much fun and i just couldnt believe that we dont do it very often at all. I guess it is because we get wrapped up in all of the other little aspects in our lives that we forget about girly time.
   Enrique had his cd player stolen from his car. He said they boke in through the driver side window. Poor Enrique! So many problems with that cd player. I miss my Enrique. I cant wait to see him."

"event","So here's the deal. I had a job interview at the coffee shop yesterday and i thought it went really well. They were suppose to call last night if they decided that they needed me. Well they didnt and i was suppose to work saturday if i did get the job. But Cathy's bachorlette party is on saturday. So when they didnt call on on thursday, I decided to give cathy a call and tell her that i was for sure coming if i could somehow get a ride. Well cowhill called tonight and asked me to come and work all day in canton tomorrow and i told her i couldn't  because of this. I am afraid i lost my chance at this job. I guess i will just go up there and talk to the lady early monday morning and tell her what happened. I really needed this job."

"event","So I finally had a good and productive day. I went to the coffee shop for and interview and hung out with lara. I also went to work. this is the first time in a long time that i haven't cried at least once. I know that sounds sad but it is true. I have so much going on in my life and so many emotions running through me right now that sometimes i cant handle them all. Hopefully things are on there way up."

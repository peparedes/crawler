"event","<p>I've been sitting a number of children lately, and the most recent additions to the rotation have been J (6) and A (4).&nbsp; </p><p>I've been walking to the school to pick them up and take them home. What is a 20 minute walk by myself is, of course, a 45 minute walk with the little ones. Everything fascinates them. We've got to stop and take a look, make up a story about it, and then have a fierce debate about who has the better *insert object or physical attribute* before we can continue the trek home. Factor in the snow that they <em>must </em>walk in, and that one stride of theirs being equal to about two of mine, and we're moving like molasses. I *could* drive, I suppose, but that would also mean that I have to wait in the horrid line that circles around the parking lot in front and spills out into the two lane street. I don't mind the walking too much anyway. It's good to be out and walking, and the cold isn't nearly as piercing when you have chattering and skipping charges to not lose. </p> <p>J. Ah, J. The girl is dramatic and has a wild imagination that my logical side, even as a child, has never been able to fully get behind. She is the firm belief that all her stuffed animals are real. Do not attempt to refer to them as inanimate objects or you will be told what's what with a scowl. I guess I don't blame her, what with not having the option of anything other than a fish for a house pet. I do see little bits of myself peeking through in her, though. As much as I would like to pretend that I was always the way I am now,there are too many home movies depicting a dramatic chatter bug to say that I was anything else.  </p> <p>She said something really funny, or at least something I found funny, on our walk home from school the other day. We were walking back with another little girl that lives in the building, and J was lifting her up and over the little puddles of water that had pooled from the melting snow. Once we parted ways, she looked up at me and said, &quot;Did you see how I was pretending with N that the puddles were lakes? Pretending stuff like that makes their childhood more magical.&quot; The darnedest things, right? I had to keep myself from laughing. I suppose she's right, after a fashion, but it's not quite something I had expect to hear. </p> <p>At the age of six, J knows how to work the system. I get the strong feeling that both children have been rather coddled, but J, she knows how to really work it. The moment that disappointment looms on the horizon, her face starts to crumple, her voice slides a few octaves up the scale into a whine, and the water works are deployed. This act is immediately reversed if the alternative is something that benefits her. To be honest, I enjoy denying her the things she wants. Not because of the impending tantrum and how funny it is, and it really is funny, but because disappointment builds character and appreciation for what you do have.I imagine my parents felt the same way when they did it to me, necessary or not. I may have not been back then, but I'm thankful for it now. My favorite requests that I've denied so far have been to go to Starbucks for chocolate milk, and to have more of my &quot;delicious delicious&quot; cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A is my favorite of the pair. I am sure there are many valid reasons as to why this is the case, but the biggest is probably because he's not nearly as dramatic and temperamental as J. I was lucky to have some one on one time with him, two days in a row, last week. He came over the first day, and searching for activities, we made fresh smoothies and peanut butter cookies. That was the best thing ever.The whole time I was reminded of the a young plucky duck and his desperate need to push the button. After lots and lots of &quot;Now? Can I push it now?&quot;, A was beside himself with excitement and laughter when he got to push the button and the thing whirred to life. The whole scene was pretty fantastic.&nbsp; The day after that he came over and we made smoothies again and my flax bread, which we then ate in peanut butter sandwiches. I don't know how wise it was to make smoothies two days in a row though, as he's been fixated on having more. I'm happy to make the smoothies for us, there isn't anything better that I could possibly give the kid, but I'm running dangerously low on fruit! I started telling him no today. It'll do him good, and I have fruit for breakfast. ;) </p> <p>I also really enjoy having A around because he has really had fun helping me make food goods. Man, can the boy crack an egg! We were making the peanut butter cookies the first night and he asked if he could crack the egg. I figured what the heck, and let him give it a shot. Goodness gracious, I was surprised that we had a beautifully cracked egg! I've let him crack all the eggs since then, and he's a total wiz at it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Both little beings are fun in their own ways, but this sibling equation has me seeing another set of children, two years apart in age. Of course, the roles are switched, but I see myself and my older brother in A and J. It's been simultaneously hard, and therapeutic to be there to act as a mediator. On the one hand, it's hard not to hear the mean words that she says and imagine that my older brother is saying them to me. On the other, perhaps this is my opportunity to help forge a healthier bond between this brother and sister. </p><p>Each child has taken to Souki differently. J, like most girls that age, loves both Souki and Mapetite, who we haven't seen much of incidentally. She will suddenly break out of concentration on whatever she is doing and will beg to go and check on (pet, play with, draw, let out) the dog. I let her. I don't care, and the dog gets attention. I wouldn't mind letting Souki out to walk around and do what she likes per usual, but then there's A. He's about 80% terrified of her. It makes sense really, seeing as how they are about the same size and level. It also doesn't help her case that she <em>really</em> loves little kids, and that she smiles. Souki does this when she gets really excited. The moment that starts, she bares her teeth, which in turn crinkles up her snout. She will lay her ears back and walk towards you like a slinky weasel, tail turning like a windmill. The closer she gets to her target, and the more attention that target gives her in return, the more she will start to prance like a bridled pony. It is a sight to behold. I can certainly see why that would frighten a 4 year old, even if she is a super sweet girl. I usually have to corral the dog into some area with a baby gate so that A can relax. Having Souki couped up simply kills J as she feels that the dog doesn't have enough room to move about. Whenever we need to go into the area that Sou is in, A begs for a piggy back ride and clings to me with a frozen death grip, body ridged and prepared for anything. Giggles, squeals, and shouts of &quot;no&quot; escape him if the dog comes too close in the effort to try to sniff his feet. Hopefully they can become friends soon. </p> <p>Something that kind of concerns me is the television. It is an amazingly powerful thing, and I hadn't fully realized just what a weapon it is. The last few times that J and A have been over, we've watched some Wallace and Gromit shows. The credits start rolling, the music starts playing, and they are lost. I can ask the same question four times before I get an answer. I don't know what else there is to say, other than that I think the t.v. will be something used only when absolutely needed.

"event","A handful of trail mix cannot be simply thrown in the mouth and  eaten. There is a certain mathematical equation to the perfect flavor  combination. These little piles of flavor within a pile of flavor are  each to be savored in their own right. There may be too many almonds in  the handful you just grabbed. Are you going to sit there and resign  yourself to the fact that it's not an amazing combination, one simply  filling the need for something to munch on? Will you take the time to  pair each almond with another nut, a raisin and some kind of chocolate  to achieve the flavor explosion that it was intended to be?<br /><br />Perhaps it all ends up in the same place, but to me, that lends to a  mentality that is dangerous. If you consume your food in a blur without  the slightest enjoyment, stuffing your gullet with an anxiety riddled  mentality that if you don't eat it quickly there will be no more, it  hints that you have the same mentality when approaching life. Eat it  quickly, gorge yourself, and then it's over. Did you even taste it?  Where is the satisfaction and fulfillment in a rushed, and glutinous  existence? One filled with the materialistic desires that we're told  that we want and need for happiness. I don't want to play that game  anymore, always hungering for unimportant goals and possessions. What is  gained by accumulation? By my assessment, using objects to fill the  void will only make you feel more empty, no matter how shiny that new  top of the line computer is. Enrichment of the mind and soul is the key  to fulfillment. I'd wished I'd known that years ago.<br /><br />For now, I will just enjoy my trail mix, one thought out bite at a  time, and we'll see where that takes me. <br /><p>Almond, two peanuts, white chocolate chip, m&amp;m, golden raisin, sunflower seeds<br /><br />Almond, cranberry, sunflower seeds, semi sweet chocolate chip, white chocolate chip. <br /><br />Peanut, sunflower seeds, cranberry, golden raisin, butterscotch chip, m&amp;m. <br /><br />Mmm... delicious. </p>"

"event","When I was, oh, no taller than a grasshoppers knee, I was singing constantly. It was tradition that whenever we would make the trip out to the farm, everyone would gather around and ask me to sing one song in particular that I had memorized well. Somewhere Out There. I'm pretty sure that the place I first heard it was on the movie An American Tail, but Kenny Loggins made it really special for me in his mash up on the album Return to Pooh Corner. What a magical album that is, and it still gives me warm fuzzies and comfort even now. I have been going through pictures of growing up and handed a stack of them to my dad to look at this morning and he started singing the song. For your enjoyment, Neverland Melody:Somewhere Out There/Never Never Land/Pure Imagination


Hold your breath
Make a wish
Count to three...
Come with me
And you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in a world of my creation
what you see
will defy explanation.

Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moon light,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me tonight.
Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
In that great somewhere out there.
And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing
A lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the
Same big sky.
Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then, we'll be together,
Somewhere out there, out where dreams, come true.

I know a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
It's not on any chart
You must find it with your heart
To come home
To never land
It might be miles beyond the moon
Or right here where you stand
Just keep an open mind
And then suddenly you find
Never Never land
Treasure when you stay there
It's precious more than gold
But once you've found your way there
You'll find that you can never, never grow old
And that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your heart will fly on wings forever
To Never, Never Land

If you wanna do Paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to
Do it
You wanna change the world
There's nothing to it
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in a world of my creation
What you see will defy explanation
If you wanna view Paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to 
Do it
You wanna change the world
There's nothing to it
There is no life I know 
To compare with pure imagination
Living there you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then, we'll be together,
Somewhere out there, out where dreams, come true.

"event","Ah shit. Here we are again with another update. You know, I always find myself being faced with the problem of never having anything I'm motivated to write about. I mean, I've got so many different trains of thought, many of which run at the same time, and all the extra bits constantly whirring and spinning around in my head throughout the course of the day, that by the time I get around to sitting down to write about what I had seen as brilliant earlier that day, I'm just so exhausted with the subject that I have no motivation. I blame my over active brain for being the reason that I don't post often. 

So, I've been doing quite a lot of... well, self discovery over the last year or so. Realizing the cause to the effect of why you are who you are is a feeling mixed of both beguilement and melancholy. I guess that was the easy part though. The hard part is figuring out how to deal with what you've got, and finding out how to change it for the better. I've been struggling with the things I've learned about myself. In fact, I feel like the closer I come to understanding myself, the more I am left feeling bereft of any idea as to how to cope. I've considered going to a counselor or some unbiased third party to talk all of this through with, but that's gonna have to wait until next year when the cash flow starts up again. Yeah, I know I've got a few people that would be more than willing to jump at the opportunity to listen ;) but there are some things that you just can't tell anyone else but a stranger. It makes for a more freeing admission without all the judgment when you run into them later. I must admit that this would be the first time that I have actually wanted to go to a counselor of any kind of my own volition. Funny how so much changes with age. 

You know, it's funny to look at one's parents and analyze them a little bit too. Let's take my mother for example. God knows I love her and she means well with most everything she does, but I would have to nominate her for the Denial award. She's tried so hard not to be her mother and has been so vocal about how she hopes to hell that she never becomes her that she won't allow herself to see that she is really closer than she thinks. For the last 5+ years my mother has been of the very strong opinion that my grandmother is a narcissist. While she may be correct in her assessment of my grandmother's consumption with herself, I've come to see it as her subconscious attempt to distract from her own, albeit a different brand, narcissism. She'll never admit it, because 1) she's the stereotypical woman who never admits that they are at fault or have flaws, and 2)... well, the first reason covers the bulk of it really. My mother's flavor is medical narcissism, constantly dwelling and talking about what new issue she's dealing with and then lecturing at length as to what she found in the way of information on the internet. I can understand that she has a reason to be looking for her own information on the internet, considering her constant health problems and the system not really putting it's neck out there to help you all that much these days, but there has to be a line that determines the necessary from the obsessive. Shit, if I even mention that I haven't been feeling well or have a certain symptom, she'll go out and fill my inbox with a hundred different links on the subject, many of which are just playing the broken record. Perhaps she likes finding all this information, but I, for one, find that it does nothing but give me anxiety about shit I may or may not have, with the end result being that I had something totally different. I've gotten to a point where all the other accumulated shit in life has got me so wound up and strung tight that I just can't take anymore stress than is absolutely necessary, so I've just taken to deleting the emails without even reading them. I want to tell her to just bugger off when it comes to this shit, but she always gets so bent out of shape that it's easier just to not say anything. Anyway.

Speaking of my mother, I'm hosting the family Thanksgiving/Christmas gathering this year. It's a step out of the ordinary to have our family Christmas anywhere other than the parent's and at Christmas time, but it's always such a hassle to get everyone together and have a relaxed time, and I am not eager to drive home again any time soon. :P My brother and his wife also adopted a beagle a few months back, and considering my mom's ""no dogs in the house"" policy, it makes sense to have it where the dogs can be indoors. So, early December everyone is coming out this way to have our gathering here. I'm excited yet anxious all at the same time. Considering my mothers sensitivity to anything that smells, it could be a total nightmare. Just about every single attempt at a family vacation has ended up with us hotel hopping to find one that was ""safe"" and not really being able to enjoy anything because there was always the stress and fear that there would be some new problem to deal with just around the corner. I've been painting the walls to cover the old smoke smells in the walls from when Rannell smoked, and it's been working fairly well I guess, although it's going to be necessary to steam clean the carpets and switch over to everything unscented a month before they arrive. Regardless of what happens, no one can say that I didn't give it a damn good effort.

I've felt a bit socially starved lately. Makes sense seeing as how my human interaction has been majorly limited to Rannell and my work family. I've got two friends north of Chitown, but as everyone knows, things have been tight and you don't drive if you don't have to. It's been pretty lonely to be honest. Mathieu has been gone for a year now and at this point it's pretty much indefinite. Without him there, there's a great sense of loss. There's always the feeling like you have something really amusing you want to tell your best friend, and you look over expecting them to be there, because they had been for a long time, and coming to remember that there's nothing there anymore but an empty seat. I'm very sad to see him go but I know he's doing what he needs to and I can't fault him. 

Well, I think that's all I can muster for one evening. It's definitely time to hit the hay."

"event","Man. It's been awhile. I couldn't tell you where the time has gone, except that I don't have a lot to show for it that I can be proud of. Don't get me wrong, I've had my accomplishments like the dog being alive and somewhat trained, I just haven't accomplished what I'd hoped I would. <br /><br />To play a little catch up, I quit the &quot;bakery&quot; job that I had. I won't ever regret that decision, simply because it was the most poisonous environment that I've ever been in, but it's proven to be the harder path to travel. After I left there I decided that I wanted to take a break from pastry, feeling tainted from my previous experience. I went and worked for a vet clinic for awhile, but that was really quite the joke of a job. I went in thinking that I'd be in some kind of secretarial position, but that never ended up happening and I got stuck poking dogs with needles and blah blah blah. Nothing happened the way my employers said it would in regards to my position, and it just ended up being a weird situation. After that there was a brief stint at a t-shirt company here, but due to health issues and it being a seasonal position, they didn't really decide to keep me on after the sale. I can't blame them, it never looks good when you're out sick with the flu for a week, and even worse when the seasonal job only lasts for five-ish weeks. Between each job there's been a period of maybe three months or so where I've been unemployed, and crikey.. it's been no walk in the park. You know, I'd love to have a great and amazing job that would allow me to have three months off at a time to do traveling or whatever, but when it's under the circumstances of unemployment, it's bleak and depressing. Right now I'm on the down swing again and mixed with the weather, and being sick all the damn time, it's really got me down in the dumps. I've had enough money to just make ends meet, but I've gotten to the end of that safe net and it's made everything just that much more daunting. <br /><br />I don't know what to say though about the whole job thing.. I'm kinda lost. Pastry seems to have lost all it's appeal to me as a profession and yet if you asked me what I wanted to really do with my life, I'd probably stand there with my mouth gaping like a fish out of water. Sure, I have things that drive me and that I love doing, but shit... let's look at the possibilities. Most anything requires you to have some education and a degree of some sorts, I mean, at least if you're wanting a career from it. I honestly wouldn't mind going back to school, but learning from my last flop of a life decision, I've not jumped in head first. I'm also hesitant to shell out more money when I've got no direction and a mountain of debt already. I've tried taking those stupid personality tests to see where I would best be suited, and I've tried talking to the career counselors at the college, but no one seems to really have the time for you unless you're plight will put the cash in their pocket. I really an truly want and know that I need a job. I want that sense of usefulness again, a steady schedule, and the start of cash flow again is always wonderful.. it's just a struggle when you are floundering and sick. <br /><br />While my life hasn't necessarily been the busiest one ever, the past year has been a blur. Looking back, I spent just about fifty percent of the time sick. The news has reported that this year has been the worst flu season in American history, and I must have been lucky enough to get hit each time it came round, to then deal with the bronchitis aftermath. Now that I'm finally over the flu for the third time, I find myself back in the doctor's office and having a flash back to junior year of high school. I would have bet anything that I had ulcers, but thanks to modern advancements, we've ruled that out and are still on the road to figuring this shit out. The newest theory is gallstones.  It's been pretty terrible to tell the truth. I've lost over 20 pounds in the last month and a half, I've had no energy to speak of and I can't stand up for any real period of time without being overwhelmingly nauseous. My entire stomach area feels like I've swallowed a super nova and it's trying to find it's way out of the front of my tummy. Pain in my stomach and pelvis area are pretty much the daily norm now. *Sigh* I tell ya.. it's really tiring to always be sick with one thing or another and having all these ridiculous problems when you're only just beginning to explore your twenties. I guess that's the only upside to not having a job at the moment. I don't have an employer to disappoint. <br /><br />**Update** Well, it wasn't gallstones. You know, I don't <i>want</i> to have anything to be wrong with me, but most of me really really wants them to finally find something, if only for the fact that if they find what the problem is, something can be done to treat it so I'm not in pain all the fucking time. Also, due to douche bag doctors the first go around, I've switched to someone else and we're working on a new theory. It's a really nice thing having a doctor that doesn't think you're crazy or making shit up. <br /><br />Considering all circumstances, I honestly don't know how Rannell puts up with me sometimes. I count myself really lucky though. Hell.. he's been more supportive than I could hope anyone to be, and I'm so grateful to him for that. Part of me sometimes feels like he's so good to me that I just don't measure up, although I try my damnedest to show him every day that I love him and that I appreciate what he does for me. I'm so happy with him and what we have together, and let me tell ya kids, this may just be the real McCoy. Rannell and the girls are by far the most positive contributors to my life, and are my reason for getting up in the morning. We've actually been talking about our future together and about our plans to get married. I'm really excited and can't wait. Now, while the large picture perfect wedding is what most woman dream about for their whole lives, I can't help but be attracted to the idea of just having a small intimate wedding and then something more special for the honeymoon. Who knows though, I may end up wanting &quot;every girls dream&quot; after all.<br /><br />Well, I think it's time to wind this up. It's taken me almost a week to write just this and I'm losing all motivation to keep adding. Hey, thanks for stopping by.<br /><br />~J"

"event","So what can I talk about? You know, this writing to motivate.... takes some motivation. ^_^

Rannell bought a Wii a week or so ago and that damn gaming system.... HOLY SHIT SO MUCH FUN! I mean, all you really need is to buy it and play the game that comes with it. WiiSports is fun just by itself. You get to make your own character that looks like a big headed lego dude. The game options are bowling, golfing, tennis, and boxing. Also, playing the games is a little bit of a work out! Tiger balm is totally your friend until you get used to playing it. 

Next random ranting: Why are people so hell bent on making themselves out to be so much older than they are? Society is making 23 sound ancient now-a-days. Psh.. Please. I firmly believe that 24 or the surrounding ages are still so young! Babies even. To me, 50 is the new 30 and 55 is just hitting middle aged. I make it a point to let people know what my view on this subject is but the common response is to repeat the remark 'But I am soooo ooolllldddd.' You know what? From now on I am going to call y'all 'old timers', remind you to wash your damn dentures, and assist you to your walker. We'll see then if you think you're old. :D

Something that has been one of the topics on my mind lately is the dumbing down of society. Guess what people... in three years it's going to be the year 2010. All the t.v. shows, the movies, the books, have 2010 as the future... this high tech world with above normal intelligence and a brighter future for tomorrow. Instead, I feel as if we have hit a standpoint. Have we reached the high point in our bell curve and all we have is to go backwards from here on out? There was this movie that recently came out call Idiocracy. It stars Luke Wilson and it's about how he is an average joe that gets used for this science experiment. He and this chick get put into a frozen hibernation for what they are told will be a year. Due to some scam with the sector, the building gets torn down and they are forgotten about. They wake up for some reason in the year 2550 and the whole fucking world is covered in trash.. The trash piles are like Mt. Everest and everyone is a complete moron. I can't express how much anxiety this movie gave me because I feel like our society is creeping closer and closer to that. Please, dear sweet Jesus, don't let it get that bad. Needless to say, we didn't finish the movie because I literally felt like I was going to vomit. 

I watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning or something. I really think that not only are people becomming idiots, but we are all becoming more and more desensitized to violence. This movie.. I think they have hit a whole new level of 'omg did they really show that??' Want to see a guy get his legs broken into a million pieces with a sledge hammer? Or how about seeing him get his head bashed in with the same sledge hammer as he lays on the floor and begs for his life? Well guess what! You can now see said things happen in this movie! I have to say that I think I have a pretty steady stomach for violence, and that I can take a lot of blood and guts, but this movie was almost too much to  handle.

OH! Let's not forget that the Bears are going to the Superbowl! You know, I honestly can say that I have gained a new appreciation for football and it's... related activities. I do have to laugh about it though.. it's funny timing for me to start liking it at the end of the damn season. I guess there is always next year to get more into it. 

For now though, it's time for me to go make dinner and keep Rannell from throwing the Wii remote into the t.v. because he can't get past this one level. Oh what fun ^_^

"event","Well shit. Today, well... the past week or so really, has been rather... straining. Pardon me if my post is a little more harsh or verbal than it normally is. 

First let me mention that I went to Q101's Twisted 13 featuring none other than the wonderful Guster. Chess (Rannell's roomie) gave us VIP passes to go see it. I was stoked needless to say and they were simply fabulous. However, while there I had some little annoyances that presented themselves. Let me ask this. When, in the existence of time, was it made ok to use your cell phone light in the middle of a dark concert arena instead of a lighter to give 'tribute' or whatever to the band? It makes me ill that people are that dumb. You, Sir or Madam Cell Phone Light User, are a complete douche and should be chased around with a chainsaw. Period. I also came  upon the realization that I dislike music from bands that scream in their songs... like Jet. Jet was the other big name band that played and I have to say that I really didn't enjoy them at all. They were dramatic and the lead singer was like a damn monkey crawlin all over shit on the set. All the little girls seemed to like it though so I guess they were doing something right. 

Today I tried to make candies and everything flopped. I hate myself for letting my skills falter and I hate my boss and my job even more for under-utilizing me and letting my skills be squandered. I hate myself for forgetting all this important information that *makes* my profession. I feel almost like someone should strip me of my chef hat. I don't feel like I deserve my title most days anymore. 

*Shakes her head* I'm tired of things not working out. Jobs, friendships, projects, relationships (romantic or otherwise). Yes, I realize that I'm bein' emo and shit right now but you're here to read it so suck it up. I am also fucking tired of AIM sending me this bloody Active update alert every fucking five minutes. DIE AIM, YOU SON OF A BITCH!

Hmm... Yeah I think that's it for now.

"event","So this morning I got up and went about my business of getting my cereal made and such. I was in the kitchen and I was listening and there was a kinda scratching sound. I really didn't think too much about it because I had heard it before and I guess I thought it was just the flies buzzing around behind the stove. The cats had been chasing them around. Anyway. I got up and went towards the bathroom to wash my face and I heard the shuffling behind the stove. I thought to myself 'damn it one of the cats got back there and must be stuck'. So I look back there and see a little movement. I can't see much because it's dark but I call both cats names and neither one answers. I thought to myself 'they must just be scared' so I got Willow to get her flash light just to make sure the cat was back there because I didn't want to move the stove for no reason. Low and behold, there wasn't a cat back behind the stove, but a fucking squirrel. No idea how it got in the house, and no idea how long it had been back there, but it was. I am going to bet it was for at least a day or two because the cats have been stalking the  stove and that corner of the kitchen for a few days now. And here I thought it was flies. ;) Willow and I went right to work finding boxes and getting the broom and we scared it into the box. It was funny, not because we were screaming or being pansy girls like most would. It was funny because of how calm we were and the conversation we were having while catching the little sneak. Once he was in the box we put a cookie sheet, yes.. a cookie sheet, over the box and took him outside. He wasn't hesitant at all to leap and bound away in the manner that only a squirrel can. It was an interesting morning :D"

I mean, I was slightly disappointed in some aspects but I will get to that in a moment. The kitchen was a great size and really only 5 people are working in it at one time. Super for me who likes space :} The items also seem relatively simple enough to make to. However, what I am not so happy about is the fact that they don't make any of the bread there, and there is little to no chocolate work that they do. They also have no benefits to the setup, which sucks because I could REALLY use the benefits. The trek is also an hour one way. While I am willing to do that for a job that I am passionate about and love, I am not sure this is that job. I guess I will continue to look for a place that screams out to me, and if I don't find it, I'll go to Greek place.

It's that time of year again where you can smell the sewage in the streets and the body odor on the people walking past you. It always amazes me that so many people don't wear deodorant. It's that something you do to keep your fellow human beings alive? *gag* So, along with the weather brings the fact that it's hot as shit inside and outside the house, which reduces me to wearing daisy duke shorts and a sports bra. Shut up, this is not sexy, it's gross. When it gets hotter I am hoping I won't have to get any more skimpy than it is already. Good lord.. it's only 82 and I feel like it's never been hotter. Maybe it's because it was a f'in ice box in my house only a week ago. Even the cats don't know what the hell happened. They are lethargic from the heat and can't do much more than walk 5 feet to find another place to pass out. I feel just terrible for them and sometimes contemplate shaving them down so they can be cooler. However, that would be cruel and unusual punishment and I am sure it would freak them out much more than a lot of other things would.

I was on the train tonight and I saw a beautiful man. He was in his 20's and looked to be of the 'indie' type. It was fun to kind of.. assess him. From the looks of it he had a LOT of tattoos. The ones I found most interesting were the cuffs on his wrists. On the right side were flames starting from the joint and going maybe 3 inches down. On the left, in the same spots and length, was water. Bold colors, very detailed. I was immensely curious and intrigued. Honestly, I've never been a huge fan of tattoos, but as of late I've been somewhat fascinated. I've even contemplated getting one of my own, however, I am still reluctant as hell to put something with that permanence on my body. It will also take great thought and care in the choosing of said hypothetical tat.

I knew there was something else to say but damn if I can remember it..  Oh well. Next update :} It's time for me to go lay on my bed and try to sleep.. maybe. ;)

"event","Ah tonight. My mind is a million places at once and there isn't a steady thought to go on. I will apologies in advance if nothing makes sense. 

My family came out to see me this weekend. It was great to see them. I was truly needing it and I think it did me good. The time I had with them, however, went far too fast. I felt like I had just gotten a grasp on them and then they were gone again. I am looking forward to going home again this summer. 

I have felt... inadequate for just about everything lately. Mainly relationship wise, but that's something for later. It's just, so terribly hard to know where you stand with something when there is little to no communication on the topic. It eats at me and I want to talk about it, but when it comes to verbalizing it, I become speechless. I guess I don't know what to do other than to throw my hands up and surrender to the fact that there just isn't much I can do. All I know is that it aches.

I think that is as far as I am going to get with this post tonight. It's time to shut down.

"event","So there are a few things that I wanted to jot down my thoughts about.

Firstly, it was a down day. I have needed nothing but human contact, and I have gotten some, but it just did not satisfy that thirst. It's definitely one of those days where I just crave the warmth and feeling of someone beside me. I hate being needy. It sucks.

I went to lunch with Kenneth today. It was nice. I have to honestly say that there was a lot about him that I had forgotten. I had forgotten how icy blue his eyes are, how pouty his lips seem, what his hug was like, the sound of his laugh, and how he loves to play the air drums. It was fun to re-learn these things about him. I also forgot that he hardly ever makes eye contact. Maybe it was a bit, I don't know, intimidating to him that I keep eye contact? Anyway. I am honestly proud of him. He's come such a long way from where he was 6 or 7 months ago. I really do think he will go places now that he has his life in check. I don't know what will become of this situation, if we will be buddies again. Only time will tell I guess.

My parents and little brother are coming to Chicago to spend some time with me next week. I am definitely excited. It will be good to see them again. I still don't know what I am going to take them to go see around here, because lets face it, I haven't been anywhere in Chicago, save the Metro, various dining establishments and school. I do want to take them to the Shedd. I think it would be fun. 

School. What to say? It's getting to that time that I really really need to find an externship. What do I want to do you ask? Hell if I know. I would like to work with chocolates or making cakes. I think they both are right up my alley. We will see what I can find here soon. I'm wanting to apply at the school for a work study position as a TA. If I do and it gets off the ground, I would be the first student to kick off this program. I have been a TA for several different classes before and I had really enjoyed it. I also like the interaction with people and being able to help them improve on techniques. I don't know, maybe I will even apply to CHIC, or where ever, to be a TA after graduation. I guess at this point the sky is the limit as what I could really do, it just comes down to the question: Will this job pay enough for me to pay off my loans and survive? I will be the first to say that I am scared shitless in this whole process.

I have been kinda.. bored, to say the least as of late. Not only is school boring but my life outside of it is a bit dull too. The main problem is that 1) all of my friends range from 21-30 something so they are usually out to clubs or bars, which in effect makes me odd man out. 2) People just don't fucking call back. This make me a.. BLUE PANDA BEAR ;D

My camera is now on it's way to the shop to be fixed. I am really chomping at the bit to get it back. It sucks that it had to break now. All the flowers are blooming and dying and it all passes without getting a single picture of it. Two weeks can't pass soon enough.

To Stu:
Now that I know you read this every now and then I will just put my response in the post. It will stick out for you to see. I remember you, don't worry. I do remember that evening in which you mentioned. I remember also having fun touching your buzzed hair. The reason we didn't work Stu, wasn't because you shaved your head. If that had truly been the reason, don't you think I would have stopped talking to you that second day? Yeah, we had some good times together. I honestly have never had a picnic with someone before. That certainly was special. The problem with us though, was that we were never together as a couple. Yes, we dated but it wasn't exclusive. The reason, if you had forgotten, was that I had just gotten out of a almost two year relationship with Don and I was no where near ready for any kind of commitment. I ended our dating because you wanted that commitment from me and I just couldn't handle it. Anyway. It's nice to hear from you every now and again. I went back to my old Xanga site today and realized what I had forgotten in my life before I moved here. I still think of Groovelight every now and then and think of the party you guys took me to. It was great fun. 

Anyway, I think that is all I really need to post about. Talk to you later kids.

"event","So much to say, and well.. enough time to say it. Where to begin?

Let's start off first with the fact that it's going to rain. We have all the windows open so it smells nice in the house and I can hear all the thunder going on. It's nice. It's almost that perfect weather to play in the rain too. It was warmer this morning but the temp dropped a bit so it would prove to be a little chilly. The weather makes me have this feeling like I should bake something. I am not sure what, but something hearty and sweet. We shall see what events unfold. ;) Update: It fucking hailed! How does that work?!

Ok, here is something I need to query about. Why the hell do guys let their nails grow out long? It's just nasty! I guess I can understand if it was a guy from the alternative lifestyle, but come on! It is totally not masculine regardless if it is your coke nail(s) or not. Clip that shit guys. /Shiver

I got a letter in the mail from Adam the other day. I would definitely have to say that it was an unwelcome surprise. It was more of the same things that were said when I stopped talking to him in October. It's... sad. I guess I really don't have much to say other that I do believe he is living in a fantasy world to avoid reality. He still thinks that he is the real life version or something of the Dragon from the Wheel of Time books and that he's a soul older than time. You know, whatever, I guess if you believe in reincarnation it's possible, but I don't. What really makes me angry about this whole thing is that 1) if he wanted friendship, why the fuck does he write that he loves me and that he still thinks we are 'soul mates', 2) that he'd been keeping tabs on me in WoW and that 3) I never gave him my mailing address. How the fuck did he get it? I didn't give him my address for the specific reason that I didn't want him knowing where I was or how to get a hold of me. He was known for showing up at my door at random times when he wasn't welcome. I feel like my privacy has been violated in a sense. I just want to brush it aside and pretend it didn't happen but I know that it doesn't just work that way. Anyway. 

Okay! Anyone else other than me like cake batter? You know, the raw white batter from the cake mixes that you try to furtively sneak when no one is looking or when you get to lick the bowl? Well, I found some ice cream from Cold Stone that tastes JUST like that and I believe it has actual little bits of cake batter in it. Cake batter ice cream ftw!! I felt like a kid in a candy store. Definitely good ^_^

Rannell and I went to see Metric in concert last night. It was an awesome show. The first band, called the Electics, were interesting and more funny than anything. They looked like they had stepped right out of the 70's with the clothes, hair, and cloths covering half of their stuff on stage. The lyrics were really something else. Metric was great. The lead singer chick had a very commanding presence and the rest of the band was really into it too. I think the bass player was the first I have ever seen that looked comfortable  playing his bass and like it just melded with him. The sound was great and I loved the new songs that I heard. I love going to concerts. The music is so loud and the bass so heavy that it just seeps into you and rocks your whole body and touches where nothing else could. Overall, it was f'ing awesome.

Classes have been rocking lately. Psych and Wine class. I have always enjoyed learning about the human psyche and the processes of how people think and function. It's just fascinated me. At one point I wanted to be a psychologist, but I think most of you know that it would be a bad field for me to get into. Well, the clinical part anyway. Wine class is fun too. So far we have had tastings of chocolate, cheese, wine, champagne, and fortified wine. The chocolate was good and fun to compare the different chocolates and the levels of cocoa mass and cocoa liquor each one had. You could detect subtle hints of flavoring from the different plants that the cocoa beans were grown near. The cheese was definitely the most painful of the tastings we have done. Honestly? I can't and really don't like eating cheese by itself and blue cheese is the worst f'ing cheese I have ever had the displeasure of eating. It was painful. Even though were weren't allowed to drink the wine due to the whole drinking age thing, it was very pleasurable. I have to say, I really do enjoy wine and champagne. I have found a wine and champagne that I will classify as my favorite for the time being. The fortified wines were good and I have to say that I am fond of Tawny Ports, but really not so much a fan of the Cognac or the Armagnac. They have far too high an alcohol content to be enjoyable, but if getting drunk is your goal, this is the drink for you. 

The kittens have continued to be funny. I am also the proud owner of cats that have a fetish or two. They are not only really into carrying my socks around the house, but they seem to like to pick my underwear out of my folded clothes while I am not looking and drag that to various places too. I wonder what the hell they think they are doing when they do that. :} Mapetite has become so much more loving and affectionate since I have been back from my spring break jaunt home. Both of my sweet babies have been more vocal too. It's adorable. I will start talking to them and I get little responses when I pause. They smell really good too, especially after they are done sun bathing and they come to curl up with me. Delicious smelling warm kitty fur. ^_^

So Easter is this Sunday. I am not going home for it, which makes me a little sad, but I did get my Easter dinner when I was home for spring break. Erica from school invited me to her mum's Easter dinner so I will probably go to that. It was really sweet of her to invite me. It should be fun. As to all you kids that read this, have a good Easter and eat until you are comfortably stuffed. I am hoping to do so. ;)

I think that is it for now guys. I am sure this will be enough reading material to last you about 2 minutes. Don't you just wish that it too your reader just as long to read something as it took you to write it so it would last longer? For now I continue my spring cleaning. Woot.

Ps. Don't you hate when your socks suck and develop holes in the toe area? I do... It's annoying and makes me feel like a ragamuffin. Socks need to stop sucking.

Pss. Do you know Sonic Youth? If you do and you like them, get excited.  The library of Congress has honored Sonic Youth and their 1988 album ""Daydream Nation"" by adding it to the National Recording Registry. This means it's alongside innauguration speeches by FDR as well as the earliest recordings of sound. Pretty cool right? This is what my music buddy sent me about what was written: ""Pioneer members of New York City's clangorous early 1980s No Wave scene, Sonic Youth are renowned for a glorious form of noise-based chaos. Guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo had previously performed with Glenn Branca's large guitar ensembles, and their alternative guitar tunings and ringing harmonies attest to this apprenticeship. On Daydream Nation, their third album, the group's forays into outright noise always return to melodic songs that employ hypnotic arpeggios, driving punk rock rhythmic figures and furious gales of guitar-based noise. Bassist Kim Gordon's haunting vocals and edgy lyrics add additional depth to the numbers she sings."" Rockin ' :D"

I have officially lost my job (which some of you already know). I guess, because I took off two weekends to go home and see my family as well as because I was only available on the weekends to work, I was not Bittersweet employee material. It was made worse by the fact that I had asked for the weekend of the 1st and 2nd off as well and the dipshit of a manager scheduled me for that weekend. Because I didn't show up for work, it was more to the list of things against me. What grinds my gears is that they took no initiative in calling me when I 'didn't come in for work'. Bittersweets sure cares about their employees.. That's for damn sure. :P I guess I don't have to work with the stupid bitches or the crazy ass bosses anymore. Plus.

Watched Pulp Fiction for the first time on Thursday. It was very agreeable. I had previously made up my mind that I wasn't going to like it and that it was a waste of time. My mind was definitely changed. It's a good and fucked up movie. Definitely some memorable lines in there too.

So Kenneth IMed me the other day. It was a bit of a surprise that he messaged me. I guess I didn't think about who could send me messages when I opened the security on AIM to let everyone im me. It's been at least 3 months since I have thought of him and longer since I talked to him. He seems to have changed a bit. Sure, he's still drinking and hating life, but he seems a bit more sane than before. It was actually not bad talking to him for a bit. He also sent me some of the music he's composed. He's got talent, he just needs to ditch the booze and take a more positive outlook on life and he could really go places. I do, however, think that it's a good idea to keep him at arms length. I can't allow myself to get tangled up with him again. I have had my fill of mind games. 

Oh yes. Last tuesday I went bowling with Rannell and his cool cat friends. I a lot of fun even though I am horrid at bowling. It was definitely a highlight to my week. I found it funny to watch people bowling. There are TONS of people that get so serious about the game and get so damned upset that they don't get a strike. Come on guys, unless you are on a league and in a tournament, this game is supposed to be fun and enjoyed. Anyway, I had a blast. Thanks for dragging me out there Rannell. 

Alright, I guess that covers just about everything that I had in mind to talk about.

"event","Firstly and update on le baby. Cookie came home from the emergency clinic two days ago. He's still super weak and fragile, but doing better. I am sad that I couldn't be there to nurse him back to health. I spoil that cat rotten.  I must say, he continues to surprise and amaze me at how tough he is. What a little trooper. 

Well, I was supposed to hang out with Jay today, but surprise surprise, that fell through yet again. Good lord I feel like I have to fucking pull teeth to hang out with him. I have decided that if he wants to hang out and actually wants to see me then he will fucking call. I am not playing this phone tag shit anymore. Ggthxnore.

So Willow came home today and brought news that she's been sick for her entire trip. I feel horrible for her. Her time to get the hell away from things and she gets sick. While I feel bad for her, I hope to god that she's not contagious. I don't think she should be at this point, but who knows with the two of us. 

School. Tomorrow. Suckage. I just wish that this break would go on for at least another week. Over the whole break I got to sleep in maybe once. Blah. Ah yes, that paper I may or may not have mentioned to a few of you? I wrote it, but the whole thing is me bullshitting it. I also wished, as I told Kora, that I could have slipped some subliminal message in there that told my teacher to sod off and well.. not die but... yeah, just sod off. :D He's the only stupid teacher that gives assignments over breaks or over the weekend before his classes start. I want to kick him.

Oh yes, I also want to make sure that people know that, no, I was not pregnant but talking about my cat Cookie back home. (You silly Draggypoo ;) ) In all honesty, I have seriously been rethinking having kids. Yes yes, save the 'you are too young to be thinking about that' speech. I think I know just what I am talking and would consider myself more mature and know more about where I am going than some people that are 30. I can't see myself wanting to bring a child into the horror that is our world today. It's just beyond me. I don't think I need to get into that much but if you feel that I need to elaborate, you know where to find me. Also, I don't know how well I could really handle a child. Sure, just like any woman, I would want that bond with a life that was born from me, but in the line of work that I am going to go into, there just really isn't time to raise a child. Anyway, enough of this tangent.

Iron and Wine. Damn good. If you have any, send it my way. I form music addictions and this is my newest. Hey, it's better than crack right? Right? ;D

I had breakfast at this kickin' place this morning. It was a retro restaurant that has a very eclectic atmosphere. It's called Kitschn. Yes, that is the correct spelling. Thank you Rannell for showing it to me, and for the damn good waffle. 

Damn, either I am gaining some really dry but hilarious humor or I am just becoming more and more slap happy and have no idea what the hell comes out of my mouth. Either way I have been getting a kick out of myself. It's nice and I get even more tickled when I laugh at the stupid jokes I make.. OMG I AM BECOMING MY MOTHER! Sweet ;D

Crash time. 
~Jess

Ok fuck sleep for now. I am angry and need to get this off of my chest. First of all, my mother comes online and wants me to guess how much it cost to keep Cookie alive. Well gee whizz mom, do I really need to know? Of course I do!! Almost a thousand dollars. Thank you mother. I can see that you are more concerned with telling me just how much it cost to keep him breathing instead of being happy that he's still in this world. If it's going to be a problem for you, just let him fucking die next time ok? What if it was one of your nasty birds? I am sure then you would be willing to pay that pretty penny right? Without hesitation? Sometimes.... RAWR! Sometimes you make my blood boil because you have no understanding of the world or the ways of life. Damn it I love you but you have to open your fucking eyes! Yes, Cookie being alive set you back 1K in the bank, but wouldn't you do anything or spend what it takes to keep someone or something you love alive? Damn you mother for being so cold at times. 

She also has no idea how much my father does for her. GOOD LORD WOMAN!! OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES!!! PLEASE! Yes, he hasn't been completely emotionally there for you through your battle with health, but that does NOT mean that he has never shown you the same care that he just showed the fucking cat. How the hell can you say that?! Who works to support you and the rest of us? Dad. Who pays the goddamn bills? Dad. Who tells you that you can go wherever you need to in order to get help regardless as to if it is covered by insurance and pays out the ass to get you treatment that doesn't work? DAD! Your mate, your husband. He could have dropped you on your ass when you got sick, but instead he stuck with you. Sure he's got communicational problems but if paying the bills for you to be better and supporting you is all he can do to show he cares, BE GRATEFUL! You chose him as your partner. And good lord! He buys and brings you wonderful gifts! I know no one else who's husband buys them the kind of things he does for you. Beautiful jewelry that I will probably never again see unless I inherit them. Yet you treat him like the village idiot. Mother, I love you, but if this goes on any longer, we will have a good and long talk, where it is just me talking and I definately have a few choice words for you. All I can say right now... You fucking hurt my heart.

"event","So what to update you with? Late night musings that have spilled over into the daily thoughts? For now, I believe that will suffice. 

Have you ever looked back at what you have written before and thought to yourself, 'how could something that has thought and insight come from my head when I feel like anything and everything that comes out of it is inane babble'? I have been worn so thin that I feel like I am stumbling over my words, that I lost 50% of my vocabulary, and that I have to think for at least 5 minutes to come up with something half way intelligent. I dislike myself immensely for being an idiot. I hate feeling like my brain has slipped off for a vacation and it didn't tell me that it was leaving or when it would be back. I hope it finds it's way home. I miss having my wits firmly wrapped around me. 

I have been missing something. That certain something that fills voids and brings comfort and consolation. Is it love? Has it been that I haven't created something in 3 or 4 months, or could it be that I haven't painted in almost a year? I don't know what it is but I hope that I find out what it is soon because it has been eating at me. The season hasn't been helping my situation or sanity any either. It's been gloomy and cold and has had me wishing just to curl up and hide from that which wishes to oppress me. The weather has also aided in bringing me down and reminding me of moments in time that have passed. I find myself having moments of wishing that I could go back to them, but immediately I realize what the hell it is that I had just thought and remember why I am not still in those situations. Times like these help in the idolizing and perfecting of situations that were neither perfect nor ideal. Again, sanity needs to come home. I wish it would respond to a dog whistle and come trotting back obediently.

So I am home for Spring Break. It's been, interesting to say the least. My brother is married and gone so it's just the 4 of us. It's been somewhat of a shock to come home. It's so much more spread out and quiet than chicago could ever hope to be. It's good though. I think too much city does something to people. Maybe not everyone, but I am certainly one that is changed. It hardens a person and coats ones skin so that they are impenetrable. It's good to escape the hardness of the city. It's rained while I have been home. The metaphorical cleaning of everything and such. It soothes the aches of the daily grind. It's been a bit hard being home though. I haven't felt like it is still my home, but that I am just a guest here. My parents have also started to show signs of becoming the mirror image of the tedium that is my grandparent's relationship. The bickering, the un-acceptance. I sat them down and voiced my concern, but of course it was taken as a joke by my mother and I could never get a straight answer as to if she would try to not be so damn negative. She's a least 50% of the problem and she's in denial. 

Only 3 months left of school then 3 months of externship. I can hardly believe that time has gone by so fast and that we are almost done. To stay in Chicago or not stay in Chicago, that is the question. We shall certainly see when the time nears eh? I mainly just wish someone would take over and say 'Don't worry about it Jess, we have it all worked out for you'. That would be nice, and one less thing for me to have to deal with. I am glad to be getting out of school. I am tired of being screwed over by my school and having them be none too gentle about it either. Know anyone wanting to go to culinary school? Tell them to NOT come to the Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago. Trust me, the screwing is so hard you can't sit right.

I may have to invest in a new mp3 player soon. Mine has somehow produced a short and will only feed signals to the right side of my headphones. It's somewhat annoying to only hear part of the song that I am trying to listen to. Someone thought it would be neat to only have some of the musical composition come out of one side and part out of the other. Whatever genius that was needs a kick in the pants.

What else to say? I believe that for now, that is it. I have yet again fallen into the ditch that fogs over your brain. I will edit this later if I can think of something, so keep an eye out.

"event","So I have previously posted a list of what I look for and want in a guy. I have updated and added to said list, so here goes:

1) Does Not Smoke
I have dated smokers before and I will not do it again. If you like me enough, the habit has got to go. I am sorry, but I don't want to subject myself to that and if this relationship would ever become a permanent thing, ie marriage, I would NEVER dream of subjecting my children to it. I hated the fact that I was constantly covered in smoke. Also.. it does not make the person attractive in any way shape or form. Blah!

2) Rarely Drinks or Drinks in Moderation
Who likes to deal with drunks? Not me. I can understand wanting to drink, I do. What I am talking about is in moderation. Unless you yourself have been drinking, it is not terribly pleasant to kiss someone who has. I would enjoy sharing a drink now and then, but every other night? Bah.

3) Personality
I am a double sided coin so I need many things in this aspect. I would like someone who is outgoing. I myself am a little bit of an introvert at first meeting, but after that I am very open. I need someone with a bit of energy. Have you ever noticed that if you around people that are gloomy or lethargic, you start to feel that way too? I am a peppy person most the time, so I need someone who can keep up with me. I would like it if they do really crazy things with me sometimes too. It is so much fun to be spontaneous. I am, however, also somewhat of a homebody and have my calm, quiet, mellow moments when I just need to sit and observe. It would be great to have someone that understands this.

4) Shares Passions
With this one, I am not asking that they share ALL my passions but a good amount. I would like to be able to share my deep love for beauty, art, nature, reading, cooking, animals, etc etc with someone I love. A relationship without such a thing is so lonely. I also want someone that is fun and loves to joke around with me but isn't afraid to have a serious conversation or debate.

5) Same Religion
I would really like this to be what happens. I mean, could you really go through life knowing that your loved one will never know God? Could you handle knowing that they are going to go to hell? I will never condemn someone, or put them down for their beliefs, but I can be sad. It also would pose a problem for marriage, and as to what religion to raise children.

6) Respect
I deserve respect, no? I feel that they should respect me, my decisions, my morals, my ideals, treat me as an individual, and treat me as an equal. If I say that I am not going to do something, listen to me. I don't want to be begged, or guilted into it and I WILL end up hating you for it. If they ask me for my opinion, use the information, don't just put it off, then take the advise of some other person that said the exact same thing I did. I am just a little bitter on this subject because I feel that I have been given so little respect in the past.

7) Affection
Like anyone I need love and affection. I need to be cuddled and caressed. I haven't gotten this like I have needed. I am a very touchy feely person and I need more than the occasional touch. And another thing that guys don't realize, or a vast majority of them anyway, that girls LIKE their hair played with. WE LOVE IT.

8) Looks
Now, people are naturally going to want to be with/date someone they are attracted to. Although, this does not mean that I will only date the model/body builder type. This varies greatly on each individual and their preferences. I don't know how to describe what I like guys to look like. I have to say though, that I love eyes, lips, hands, and hair just long enough to run my fingers through.

9) Tenderness
I need someone who can hold me when I cry, and not push me away like I have some unknown plague. I need nothing more than to be held when I cry. Simple holding will do. I don't need the false ""It's going to be ok"" if it really isn't. I need someone who can let down their guard and take me in. Something else that I would really love from this category.. I would really love someone that asks me to dance to slow music. Frank Sinatra would be the perfect choice for that. :} Hell.. I would consider a lot of things tender. 

10) Willing to try new things
Now this category is very very broad. One thing is that I would really like to find a guy that will go and take dancing lessons with me. This could fall under the passions category, but I can't dance well either so it's really not a complete passion ;) 

I think this just about covers everything, and I think I have enough detail to give a good understanding as to what I mean.

"event","So what to tell? I am sure that there really isn't much that I could write here that most of you don't already know. I will try to think of something but if I repeat shit.. I am sorry.

I went home for Christmas break and got to spend a week and a half with my family. In this short amount of time, I was once again reminded of why my brother and I don't get along. He is a fucking prick. Simple as that. His wedding is getting closer and closer and all I can think about is that I hope Nicki knows what the fuck she is getting into with him. I really truly hope that he doesn't turn on her. Anyway, back to my week. I got home and that was nice. I sat next to a guy that looked like a young Hugh Grant and we talked the whole time. He was from Lawrence in KS but I didn't get his info. I guess I thought it best since nothing would have come of it anyway. Funny thing was, he was studying to be a philosopher. Seems like I can't get away from you guys. JK ;D

When I was at home, I rebuilt the ties with Cookie (he was mad at me for just up and leaving), got to see some old friends, and I got to have quality time with my mom and dad. Mom and I did a good amount of cuddling. Seems like neither of us is getting the right amount.. or any at all. Dad and I spent time making truffles together, which was good because at that point I was sick of making them and the batch we were on was the second one that I had made of the coconut ones for him. He needed to do some of the work too. ;D I believe that I ended up making... 6 or 7 batches of truffles. I hate chocolate. ^_^ 

My ulcers, unfortunately, flared up the second or third day that I got there so I was sick pretty much all the time I was at home. It was just shy of being miserable, but it was still not fun. I did, however, eat anything and everything they made because, shit, when am I going to have access to hearty home cooked meals that are free again? Not for awhile. I also got some Panera (omfg yum) and some good ol' BBQ from Zarda. Oh how I miss thy smokey goodness. My Dad also made those heavenly creations of fried tacos. Silly man only made 6 for each of us, but damn, I can eat about 10 of them. I guess it was a good thing because I can and will eat myself sick on those. ^_^ Another thing that I got at home that I don't have access to in Illinois: Artic Shatter Powerade. It's my favorite kind and they don't carry it anywhere in Illinois. Nor do they carry my favorite salad dressing, or chipped beef for the best gravy for biscuits and gravy ever. I swear, they are backwards here. ;D

For Christmas I got an awesome digital camera, more candy that I can eat in a year, some Happy Bunny pjs that say 'I just remembered I don't care' on them. I guess my mom thought it fit me to a T, but I don't know about that. ;) I also got some cds that I had been wanting. Rilo Kiley and a cd of Jacqueline du Pre. My little brother surprised the shit out of me and got me a 'AromaMist Fountain'. I had always thought they were cooler than hell and it was totally awesome that he picked it out all on his own. He's a really good kid. My grandmother got me a thermometer (laugh). I guess now I can know if I have a fever. She did however give me some money and a cool blanket that she made as well. Don gave me a WoW game card which came in handy, and Kora sent me a documentary dvd on Death Cab for Cutie. Parsons gave me a wonderful handmade card. I always am tickled to get a card from him. ;) My mom and I also now have a matching pair of flannel pajamas. Blue with clouds and stars. I picked those out ^_^

When my time was up at home, I was deeply sad to leave. I was, however, missing my little babies and wanted to see them. It feels somewhat odd to go back and forth between houses. It's got me somewhat confused as to where I belong. It also tickles me to know that my dad wants me to move back in when I come back to KC. I imagined that I would get an apartment. He had the idea that I was moving back in. It will be interesting to see what happens in that regard and what becomes of the kittens and what we can work out about that. Don't get me wrong, I am keeping them. My mom is just leery about having 4 cats in the house, how the two guys will react to my girls, and if the kittens will tear shit up. 

Another great christmas present that I got: Someone finally rented my other apartment. I no longer have to pay double rent each month. What a nightmare that was. I now, however, have to deal with the nightmare that is financial aid. I have never felt so lost and alone in my life on something. It has hit me like a huge brick on how much I will owe and how much I will have to earn a year to even live while paying my bills. There is just no way that I will earn as much as they say I will have to in a year. Starting pastry chefs make close to nothing when they start out, and they say I have to make at least 40K a year? HA. Looks like I will have to be working 5 jobs at once. I just need to find me a rich husband. JK! ;D 

Love life? It's been non-existent. I guess I have decided that I am really just tired of looking and hoping and waiting for someone, that perfect someone, to come around. Sure, I still get a pang of envy when I see a couple walking down the street hugging and laughing. Sure, I still would like someone to lay with me and just hold me, loving me, but I guess I am tired of looking for it in all the wrong places. I hope too much and imagine that what I need is right there in front of me, when what is really looking at me is a mess. I guess that I too am just not ready or equipped for anything serious right now. I just don't have the heart or the drive or energy to put into something that should be full of meaning. For right now, my only loves are my kittens. 

I started school back up on the 3rd and let me tell you, my classes suck. I am taking Western Civ. and Food and Beverage Cost Control. I hate Western Civ. In fact, I really just hate all history classes. I can not bring myself to like anything about them at all. I am going to try and see if I can't switch classes to another Western Civ teacher that I hear is good. The one I have now says 'uhm' every other word, and when he teaches, he reads directly from a powerpoint which he gives us all a copy of. I feel that if I am going to pay the idiot $1K to teach me, he could at least do something else other than that. Food and Bev. Cost Control is really very simple. It's all math equations and crap to find the food cost percentage, labor cost percentage, break even points, average guest check and so on. I will have to try super hard to even think about failing this class. 

Something that has been bothering me lately. A week or two ago, I was hit with the question: Do animals have souls? If not, then how do you explain the emotions, the feelings, the consciousness that an animal has? If you pet an animal, does it not feel joy and happiness? If you hit an animal, does it not feel fear, anger, and pain? Just because they are not built to speak our stupid words, does that make them less deserving of a soul or eternal salvation? Are they not God's creatures and there for, in a way, his children? And if so, doesn't it seem logical that they too would be taken at the gates of judgment? These and so many more questions have run through my head. I have checked out 5 books from the library and all they do is contradict themselves. I have asked many people and most can't give me a straight answer. Gah. I want to see if I can't find it in the bible, but, that too was not written by God himself, but by man. Who is to say that what is in the bible, on this regard, is right? I just, have this need to know that increases all the time. 

For now, that's about it. I really can't think of anything else to talk about. Maybe later I will have another update. Have a good rest of the Sunday and I will see you cats later.

"event","So I haven't been a good little poster and kept you all updated on the shit in my life.

Lets start off with my move. I moved into a 3 bedroom apartment with a class mate and a friend of her brothers. Willow is the class mate and Cody is the guy. Willow is great. She is totally opposite my personality though which can prove to be fun. She's rather quite and shy but if you get her talking she really can have some fun. Cody on the other hand is quite the... well.. hand full. He's 23 and is really very loud. He said that he wanted to move in with us because he needed a quiet atmosphere but that has turned out to be something interesting. He is by far the loudest of all of us. 11 pm and he is in she shower screaming Shakespere sonnets at the top of his lungs and when he just plain talks he shouts. He's becoming somewhat like my annoying brother that I love so dearly. >_< We also seem to have a problem with the whole 'I eat your shit and don't replace what I ate'. This will be ending :D. Actually, Cody has been somewhat ignoring me or so I feel like. I am not sure how to feel about this. I am amused but at the same time I want to smack his shit up. ;) So yes. Other than the room mates ordeal, the apartment is great. We have tons of space and for less than I was paying before. The only thing is that we don't have control of the heat so I am a fucking Jessica popsicle all the damn time. I literally have to pull out my hair dryer to thaw my toes. And it fucking snowed today. The heat must be turned up and turned up now!

The cats are getting so much bigger and they are just getting more and more beautiful each day. They are about six months old now and are just about full size. They have the energy of ten energizer bunnies. But Fayle loves to crawl under the covers and sleep curled up near my tummy and Mapetite loves to curl up around my head. Sometimes she will even sleep directly on my head. Thank the lord I am not a baby or else she would be stealing my breath. They also love to sleep in a basket in the living room. I have a picture of it and will post it as soon as ImageShack isn't a jerk and lets me upload it. Update: Here is their pic :} <a href=""http://img297.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dscf05060ia.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/2380/dscf05060ia.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a>

School is going.. well.. slow. It's been some what of a challenge to make myself go to school every morning. I have really not been enjoying the classes we have been taking and literally dread each day. I am also very sick of all the favorites shit that is going on. I feel like I am right back in fucking high school again. That's right boys and girls. It never ends, just like I have said over and over again. It's a never ending cycle of shit. I did however have a class that I enjoyed. It was speech oddly enough. I think it was mainly because our teacher spent most of the time cracking jokes and making the material interesting. I was truly sad when that class ended. Ah well, what can you do?

Thanksgiving is coming up very fast and I am totally excited. I get to go home for a few days. It won't be long enough by any means but I will get to see my family, eat some damn good food and see my fur ball of a little lover boy. I miss Cookie something awful. It will be good to see the little mouser again. I am also looking forward to possibly seeing Don. Aparently he proposed to his girlfriend and they are now engaged. I am quite neutral about the whole thing. If he is happy then great. But yeah. It will be good to see him and his family again. I do miss them. ;D And... seeing as how there are few to no Paneras in the city, that will be a huge part of my diet while home. ^_^ YUMMY IN MY TUMMY! Oh, and I am also taking my mum to see the new Harry Potter movie. I am really excited about it. It looks like it will be awesome.

Lets see. What else? I have a little hunny that I care deeply about but I think I am going to keep the rest to myself. ;) Oh! And we are going to the Death Cab for Cutie concert on the 18th of December. It should totally rock my world!

I think that is about it for now kiddies. I hope this upday will hold you over for a bit. Who knows when the next update will be. ;) As for me, I am off to try and generate enough body heat to heat up my bed so I am not a popsicle in the morning. That should be interesting. :}

Night all you ragamuffins.

Love,

"event","Since I have been in college, I have learned several things. The main thing is that as much as everyone had hoped that graduating would be the end of all that was related to high school, they were wrong. The clicks are still the same and you are still judged just as much. Things never get any easier, and life throws more challenges your way. Yeah, we were all told that it was going to be this way, but who listens to those that have been down the same path before? 

Another thing I learned, is that people should appreciate their parents, and not try so hard to push and shove them farther and farther away. This was one of my mistakes. I was so gung-ho about moving out and being independent, but to be honest, I would much rather move back home than live where I do now. I am not even meaning that I would move back in with my parents, just back to KC so I can be closer to them. I keep telling everyone, take advantage of the time they have with their family because they will miss them once they are not around all the time. I know that now-a-days it is so uncool to be close with your parents... but trust me on this one.

I have also realized, that life will never be simple, and never be the fairy tale dream that stories, movies and everyone wants it to be. Fairy tale romances are also a rarity. Honestly? I wish for nothing more than a life and a romance close to fairy tale. While I care deeply about Adam, the relationship is far from perfect. It is terribly hindered by the fact that his parents don't really like me and don't want him having a girl friend. They seem to be trying to keep us apart and split us up now that he is off to school. And when I was at their house? I was made to feel like a constant fool for my beliefs and feelings.  Also my independence is highly frowned upon by his mother. It is my firm belief that she wants to rule his life until the day she dies. *sigh* I am not sure what to do really. I care about Adam deeply, but his mother is sucking the life out of me. And who wants to be made to feel like shit all the time? Certainly not me. My options are limited all around and none of them I like. Again, I wish for a romance closest to perfect/fairy tale, but in all reality, something is always going to be wrong. 

I think the only things that has really kept me sane have been the kittens. They drive me crazy, but they balance it out quite nicely.
<a href=""http://img383.imageshack.us/my.php?image=0223a64ky.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img383.imageshack.us/img383/5443/0223a64ky.th.jpg"" border=""0"" /></a>
They are so wonderful. They cuddle up with me for naps. They wrestle all the time and I actually feel quite bad for my neighbor down stairs. They are so rough sometimes that they are knocking their heads against the floor and it sound like I am dropping rocks on the floor. They also have some odd eating habits. Just today they went nuts for watermelon and banana. Go figure. I forgot how fast kittens grow. It's been a little over a month that I have had them and they are already doubled in size. They are truly my pride and joy. 

I think that is about all I have for now. There really isn't much else to talk about. My life isn't too exciting.

"event","Alright kids. Here is the update that I have long delayed. 

As you all know I have moved into my little apartment here in Chicago. It's tiny, but it suits me just fine. I actually had an offer from a kid to be a room mate but because I am an ass, I never called him back. I think it's more that my mind is on the fritz and I can't ever remember to do it. Whee ^_^ Anyway. My neighborhood is quaint and quiet except for those random explosions every now and then that started right after the 4th of July and which make me think that I am going to be shot. I have hit the floor a few times just because it freaked me out. Other than that I never EVER see anyone else in my apartment when I come home or leave. Another thing that has freaked me out... the intercom buzzer. It makes me jump every single time it buzzes.

I have been a resident of Illinois for about... One month and one week. But I have actually lived in my apartment for just a week. ;D When I moved here I went out to my friends house and stayed there for a month :D In this time I lived, laughed, loved, cried, and yet did nothing all all the same time. 

I am actually really quite home sick. I miss my mom and dad and that little fur ball that I had to leave at home. I think I miss him most of all. He was definitely my little squeeze toy when I was down or upset. But! I am going to be getting two adorable kittens here at the end of the month and I am so happy. TWO little fur balls to hug and cuddle :D Here are their pics. This one is going to be named Fayle.

What cute little muffin heads ^_^

Anyway. So school. It's been interesting. I am only taking one class right now and it's only for an hour and a half. I was originally supposed to have two classes but they fudged it up and signed me up for a class that I had already taken and that the credit for had transfered. So yay :D Eventually I will have so many classes, or rather, classes that go from 10am to 4pm. I really have to figure out where the train is so I don't have to take the damn bus all the time. What would take me 17 mins in a car, takes me an hour and a half on the bus. Whheeee ^_^ 

The bus, and just living here and riding the bus, subjects you to a whole lot of different people. And the smells that accost you on the bus are something else all together. There are people that smell good and then there are people that just reek. And the different kinds of people from all walks of life. There was this one old lady that was on the bus that I was just kinda fascinated with. I am pretty sure she was homeless. She reminded me of an older gypsy lady. But she was sprawled out over two seats and she was just doubled over herself in sleep. Her glasses would slide down her nose and she would jolt awake every now and then to push them up, then would proceed to fall right back asleep. I saw her again a few days later on the bus. I will probably see her on there a lot more too. The bus and living in this city is really subjecting me to that side of life that I knew about, but maybe didn't really fully understand because of where I lived before. 

I think I also have my computer fixed for the most part. My god what a hellish nightmare. I am so sad that I lost all my pictures and stuff. So! If there are any that you had sent me before, or that I sent you, or just plain ol' wanna send me, please do so. I would greatly appreciate it. 

Well, it's getting to that time where I need to get ready for classes, so I will cut this stream of unbelievably useful information short. Talk to you kiddies later. Mwah.

"event","So my life is about to make the biggest change of all times. I am moving in about.. oh.. 5 hours. I am all packed and ready to shove off at 7am.

My room has never been so clean.. and never been so empty. It feels really weird to stand in it and feel so big. Today was such a hard day. I have been in the same room as my family and already I miss them something fierce. It's really going to take some time to get used to not having my family a few steps away. I guess you really do never realize how much you need someone or something until you are on the verge of losing it. I really didn't spend much time with my family once I got my computer in my room (I wonder why >_^ )and now that I am leaving and trying to spend more time with them, I dunno.. I just guess that I thought they would always be there. That I would always be a kid and never really grow up. This past week I have really just wanted to curl up into a ball and hide from the world because I fear change, and I am terrified of being on my own. But now the day is finally here and time keeps rushing forward like a roller coaster rushing down a hill and I am missing my brakes. 

Today was tiring and hard. I think I had about three break downs and have never been so tired before. Actually, that probably isn't true, but when you get really tired, you seem to feel like you have never experienced it quite like this. My right arm hurts like a bitch. Not the OMG SHARP PAIN, but that really dull ache that is somehow even worse than the sharp pain. I BUILD ZEE MUSCLE!!! ARGGG!!!

Anyway.. this is my update until either I get internet in my apartment or I am over at a friends and decide that I want to update. Wish me luck on my adventure tomorrow and for the next 15 months.

"event","Well kids.. here we are again and another day has passed. 

I just wanted to share a little info with you all. I was accepted to the culinary institute in chicago. They want me to come out and start school July 6th. I would be there for a 15 month period with classes monday through friday from 10:30am to 4:30pm. I would also be getting an apartment. YAY for independence! It has all been such a whirlwind of events, and believe me, I am certainly scared. Thankfully I will have one of my very best friends there to support me (Yeah you know who you are ^_^) and I have made some really cool cat and 1337 friends there. My imagination has run rampant and is taking over every moment of my day with day dreams of how flippin awesome it will be. :D  I also hope to be able to have lots of people visit me. Bring sleeping bags because you ain't sleepin in my bed. ;D  

I am just taking one day at a time and praying to God that everything works out. I know that this will be a great life experience for me and that it will help me grow leaps and bounds. 

that is all for now. :D

Ta Ta!

PS. TERRY UPDATE ON LONDON!! ok.... GO!!! :D"

"event","So I have been racking my brain as to what memories I have to share. I have also realized that my life has been, when I sit and think about it, pretty event-less. It's so hard to think of a memory and find one when you want it.. but when you don't they come easily. I wonder why that is. Anyway. I grew up spending a lot of my time on my grandparent's farm in Alton. You could say I almost lived there for awhile. That was before I grew up and realized that Grandma wasn't a saint and really bugged the shit out of me. Don't get me wrong, I love her, but I don't love her trying to run my life. I am a big girl and can take care of myself. So, direct from my childhood, my memories:

I can remember a summer when I was there helping with Harvest. That was what I was always there for.. to help with Harvest. Actually.. the only thing I really succeeded in helping with was making the lunches for the guys in the field, getting dirty, riding in the truck to take the wheat into town while getting handfuls of gum from the COOP. But yeah. One day it was really super hot. Not the horrid heat like in Mexico, but the dry heat that comes from being in the prairie. I asked my grandma to take me to the pool, but she didn't want to drive all the way to Osborn, which was about 45 mins away from the farm. Yes, they are in the boonies. So instead of going to the pool, my granddad pulled out this blue barrel and filled it up with water. This my friends.. was not a good alternative. If I remember correctly, I couldn't even get my whole body in it. *shrug* I was so hot I took anything they offered. They still bring it up sometimes.. laughing at me. Hey, it wasn't my fault grandma didn't want to drive. 

I don't like growing up. Or rather, I don't like the side effects. It changes people too much. I mean, I am glad I am older and wiser, but I miss a lot of things. Like my cousin Craig. I miss hanging out with him. We used to get along really well and we would have fun during harvest. I miss the old days. I don't miss them enough to go back though. 

I am done with my memory trip.. I got stuck. ^_^

"event","So today I was encountered with someone that lost their pet. She told me about it and I was amazed at how well she was handling it. I don't accept loss well. I am the kind of person that finds a sick bunny and tries to do something for it. If it is lost, then it breaks my heart and I cry. Yeah, I cry for some creature that I didn't even know for more than an hour. I am and have always been one of those kids who has little burials for them too. It just feels right that way. I have lost so many things in my life time and have super glued my heart back together with each loss. I am amazed each time I mend it because the shards get smalled and smaller each time. Is it possible to just.. I don't know.. sweep it up into a pile of dust and roll it up in a ball of Duct-tape? I mean.. they say that fixes everything right?

One of my losses that I grieve most, other than the loss of the best person in the entire world (my Grandma Great), was my pet lamb named Violet. Let me begin by telling you why the hell I would have a lamb at my house. 

My dad grew up on a farm, and being the farmboy that he is/was and seeing how he is a vet, we had animals. Yeah, sheep and cows and wonderful crap like that. He rented out farm space from some lady so he could keep them. It was winter time and a ewe had given birth to a lamb. Just so happens that there was a goat that had two kids too. So he brought them home so they could sit under a heat lamp on the patio. I was instantly attached to those animals. I would spend hours sitting there with them.. just talking to them, because that's what little girls do, and I would much rather have a live animal versus the stupid plastic barbies. I would take them out into the back yard and 
run around with them, but Violet.. she was different. You know the song 'Mary had a little lamb'? That was me and Violet. I think that because I spent so much time with them they thought I was their mom. She would follow me everywhere. I can't remember why, but I would walk around with one of those plastic rods that you see on window blinds.. the one that makes them shut and open. I think I would pretend it was my walking stick or something. Anyway. I was tickled pink at the prospect that I had such a cute little lamb that would follow me. I even walked over to the neighbors house with her in tow just to show them how happy I was. 

Finally the day came that they were strong enough to go back to the farm and be introduced back into the herd. I was really sad when that happened, but the fact that my dad was always taking us out there to train, so I was content with seeing her there. Eventually she was sent to another farm so my dad's friends could work with her.

One night I was sitting on the couch and talking with my mom and helping her with my little brother when my brother walks in the door. He runs up to me, puts his face in mine and yells 'YOUR LAMB IS DEAD!! YOUR LAMB IS DEAD!!' I thought it was all a joke.My brother has always been cruel so it wouldn't have been anything new from him. I looked at my dad waiting for him to calm my fears and tell me that Matt was just being mean. But what I saw in his face was not reassurance.. but truth. It was real. Every word of it. I cried and cried and could barely hear what my dad said. She has broken her leg and it got really infected. She died from it. I was so utterly heart broken for something so sweet and gentle. I have hated my brother for doing what he did. He took the chance I had of getting it broken to me in a easier way. He stole that from me. 

Like I said.. we all lose things.. some of great importance, and others of lesser. They still all hurt and it still takes time to heal. I know what loss is. I have stared it in the face, and I have over come the pain each time. I wonder if there will ever be a day when it defeats me.

"event","I have always been somewhat of a social outcast. In my family and in the real world so to speak. I have never really had any true friends and the ones I did know as school buddies, you could never tell if they really gave a damn. I wasn't accepted into the popular group, and I wasn't really even excepted by the other outcasts.

I can remember the day I walked into the new school here in Kansas City. It was fourth grade and we had just moved here from Fort Dodge Iowa where we had lived for six months. I had on a maroon shirt, the kind that your mother thinks looks cute on you and you can do nothing but wear it even though it makes you get sick in the stomach thinking about how all the other kids will think it's dumb. I had a heart necklace on too. It was one of those that was clear plastic with the water and glitter and other confetti in it that would swirl around when you move. Looking back I can't do anything but sigh and shake my head at how I must have looked like a complete fool. As I walked into the school computer room the back row turned to look at me.. and by the time the excited whispers had reached the front everyone was staring at me. I wanted nothing more than to sink into the wall and dissapear just to escape all the eyes. I can't remember much past sitting down in the back row and trying not to move in my seat. They never really liked me and the boys always teased me. The fact that I was always sick too didn't help my friends situation. 

Middle school and high school were pretty much the same thing. Except for one person. Mark. This kid is something else. He's just as quirky as I am and we have a blast together. I met him my freshman year in our English class. We never really talked much because we were both shy, but eventually by the end of the year, we were friends. Sophmore year was awesome because we had Biology class together and we were always in the same group. He sat right behind me so he would lean forward and I would lean back and we would fall asleep on eachother. Our Biology teacher must have liked us or never noticed, but she never said anything.. but she yelled at two kids for 'holding hands'. He was really just trying to warm up his friends hand but hey.. it's ok. :}He and I did so much together.. I wish there were more people like him out there. More people that want to be with me rather. :}

There must be something in the water because I am wanted everywhere else but here.

"event","I am sitting here at 3 in the morning wondering why I am not in bed so I am rested for work tomorrow. For some reason I can't seem to care. I have had more than enough to make me happy, and I have been that.. really happy. It's a wonderful thing.

I have been listening to the most wonderful music lately. The Garden State soundtrack is awesome. The only way I can describe how great it is, is by telling you the feeling I get when I listen to it. 

When I put it on, I imagine that I am in a convertible car with the top down. It's night time and the air is warm and soft and caresses my skin like a silken hand. The only sounds are the music playing, the soft rush of wind as we cut through the night on an empty road, and the gentle purr of the engine. The smell of sweet rain that the patchy clouds promise would hang in the air with that soft rich smell of earth. The moon shines in all it's glory among the stars that swim in it's wake. 

This is the feeling I get when I listen to it. And this is not the only music that I get vivid images with. Another one is called Teardrop. With this song I am taken back to childhood. This is what I see.

I am back in my mothers lap, surrounded by her arms. She is rocking me while I have my ear pressed to her chest. I can hear the beat of her heart and the creek of the rocking chair as she rocks back and forth, along with the soft rustle while she slowly runs her hand over my ear and through my hair. The heat of her body calms me and lets me relax as I settle into her. She hums the tune of 'Edelweiss', which was and is my favorite song she would sing to me. I can smell the softness of her skin and the warmth of her makes it so much sweeter. The complete feeling of trust and safety is the only thing that I feel there in her lap, being held.

Thank you to that special someone that introduced me to these songs. You know who you are. Thank you for helping to give me such vivid images that I could almost swear I was there.

"event","I got a very wonderful compliment today.

I have been sick for the last few days, and haven't had any drive to put make up on or even to look nice. 

So I was working out and I looked like total crap. There was this gentleman there, 19 yrs old, who was working out too. He didn't say anything to me the whole time, but after wards he came up to me and introduced himself. He then went on to say that he didn't say anything before because he was a little afraid to talk to me. Upon asking him why, he said because I was pretty. It just made me feel really good. I know people tell me I am beautiful and such, but on one of your worst days, and when you are sick it just really does something. 

Anyway. I just thought that was really sweet."

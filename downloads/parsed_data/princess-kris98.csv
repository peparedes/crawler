"event","I definately was not planning another baby and I am very careful about watching my cycles, so I am still in shock.  I had a miscarriage when i fisrt moved to Alaska, so I am a little nervous.  Military hospital here works a lot differently than civilian hospitals.  They don't believe in doing blood tests for pregnancy tests, and I got really upset about that.  I am hoping someone can get something worked out so I can make sure everything is moving along tomorrow if I can..
Thank you Janet and Ange for your well wishes!

"event","I suck at posting.   Actually I tried posting the other day and my entry would not post, or attach a picture so I gave up.
Two weeks ago on Tuesday, after much stress on my end, I discovered I was late, like LATE.  I never have gone a whole month with no cycle.  I did not feel pregnant, been there three times, and I definately felt normal.   But I tested three times over the week(not the last but before) all came back with two lines.
I can't sleep but grab what little I can at night, and wake up at 2-4am, and want to get sick.  I never do which is nice because with my youngest one, I was sick 24-7 for 4 months and it was hell.   Due date is in June, early.  We're moving in June.  Nothing like added stress with the military life.  I only told three out of four of my siblings.  I don't like my older sister much, so I don't talk to her.  I don't think anyone would like a gloating narsistic person who brags about themselves all the time.  I would post a picture but I can't figure out how :("

I wrote my mother's psych dr back home.  I don't feel bad about doing it, because my mother, is not a normal person, at least not in the eyes of me, my younger brother and sister.  My mother is borderline personality, bipolar, and a few other things I am not aware of.  My older sister who used to work at the mental health ward at Madig@n hospital, on Fort Lewis, uses what little knowledge she has and her narcisstic personality and has ultimality screwed people over and their lives as well.  My sister is not aware she has narcissistic personality, but believe me, she has it.  My sister M, thinks she is perfect, thinks everyone LOVES her, she should be worshipped, thinks everyone else is trash, but her.  She has all of these traits:

has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements) 
is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love 
believes that he or she is ""special"" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions) 
requires excessive admiration 
has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations 
is interpersonally exploitative, i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends 
lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others 
is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her 
shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.


She has done some almost unforgivable things and it has totally ruined my relationship with my mother, and is reaping the benefits.
I think this bothers me far more than I let on....."

"event","Well today I went ans registered Andrew for school and we should know who his teacher is next Wednesday. Yesterday we went and bought his school clothes, and $350 dollars, here we are.  And we got him a pair of KSwiss shoes.  I love KSwiss shoes, they are so comfy and light on your feet. I still have to get his school supplies and another pair of shoes.   I rally don't like how his school does school supplies.  They work on a shared supply system.  In other words ever single child has to bring like a zillion things in and they all share it.  It's kind of a pain because it adds up fast and when you get to April. well, that's 100$ in under a year for school supplies.  We never did anything like that in school, so naturally I don't care for how they do it here.   But it's our last year might as well keep my mouth quiet about it.

My older sister, who I am not close to at all, and never will be, emailed me, just to rub my nose in that she got approved for the VA disability.  And they are giving her a check for $16,000.00 in back pay and she will get $2000 a month for school PLUS $1400 a month for the rest of her life.  Well, it would not mean anything except one she claimed she has IC which is a painful bladder condition, I have it as well, and I did not get it from anyone or by doing anything, she has a slightly curved spine, so she claimed that and frostbite.My sister was never Active Duty military.  She was in the Reserves, did her basic training and the like, used her GI Bill for school and when she was only in the military 1 year, she got pregnant and got out.  Then signed back in, got her choice of duty station to Fort Lewis, worked at Madigan(hospital) for a little bit, two years and then decided just last year to claim disability and get as much money from Uncle Sam.  I have a problem with this because there are other military people, retired or not who have way bigger problems medical wise than my sister does and they don't get money like that.  It makes me mad because I know my sister and she is the most greediest person alive, and I know other military people who could use that money more than someone like my sister.  
My sister has a few good qualities, but they are so limited.  She is one of those people who always wants to be better than everyone else.  If I were in college trying to get my degree, she would say' Well I am getting my degree in social work and will make so much more momeny and be more sucessful than you.'  I am serious, that is how she is.  She likes keeping up with the Jone's.  I am not like that, and I don't have the heart to rub someone's nose in my good news for bragging rights.  It's different than telling someone, but I know my sister and she was bragging.
It just made me a little irritated and realize that I have done so little with my life since I graduated from high school.  I graduated, met the wrong guy, got pregnant, guy fled the scene after I refused an abortion. I got married when Andrew was 10 and half months old, almost 7 years ago.  In Novemeber 2001, I had Matthew, then unexpectated(but a happy surprise) Luke came along in 2003 of September.  And like I said, here I am.  I love my children, I do with all of my being.  But there are many times, I just want to get out and do more with my life, go to school so I can have a degree that my children and myself can benefit from.  Everyone knows how expensive it is for daycare these days, and that's probably where I am stuck at.  Luke is 6 weeks way from being 3 years old, by time we leave here he will be 3 months shy of being 4.  All my children were born after September 1st and all schools want children who turn 5 on or before September 1st.  I just feel like I will never get my feet off the ground for another three years. And it's very much a downer on my end.
I want to be a nurse.  I know the pay is not that great, but I really want to help people, after Matthew was in the hospital for a month and right at the pearly gates knocking, it made me realize that because we had wonderful nurses and they took care of so many children, including my 14 month old, made me want to get in that same career.  My only problem aside from the daycare, is my math skills, suck.  I can do the basic math.  I never took algebra in high school, no pre-algebra.  Just basic math.  I am learning disabled in math so badly that I was in General Math right up to my 11th grade year.  My teacher tried to get me started in pre-algebra and there I sat, looking at the problem for 90 minutes and crying.  Because I oculd not even try to figure out how to work the problem.  And that's when the teacher realized, my math was low.  I am smart but I am not intelligent. I did alright in school, I stayed on honor roll for about 2 years.  My GPA is most likely around C average due to the whole math ordeal. I know here you can get your LPN after only 11 months, granted you need your CNA first which is only 6 weeks here.  
I just wish things would be a little easier and I could do this without much doubt on my part....."

"event","It surely does not feel like summer here.  It's been in the mid 60's around here almost all summer long.  Last summer was nothing like this and we did not get that much rain.  But this summer, we are getting plenty of rain.
Andrew starts school in about 3 weeks.  I am sure he is very anxious and excited to go back and see his friends and he loves to learn.  His teacher that he had last year, got married and moved to Washington state.  She is such a wonderful teacher and Andrew misses her terribly.  She was always very upbeat and positive, and that attitude got through the students.  I noticed a difference in Andrew and his desire to learn and read as much as possible.  
I was hoping if we stayed here that Matthew would have Miss Holland for his first grade teacher.  But of course we are definately not staying here past next June. It's been nice but I am ready to get back to the real world that has civilization.  I think I have said that a million times since I moved here!

I am hoping we will go down to see Exit Glacier and maybe spend the weekend near Seward.  It is a 3-4 hour drive from home, so we might as well.

I have to go put the boys to bed, and hopefully I will be able to post tomorrow.
Have a good night everyone!"

I hope everyone is having a wonderful summer and staying cool.  Here in Alaska, it was pretty hot the first two summers I was here and now it's the most cold summer I have had here. The temps range around 65-71 degrees and it's not even that warm to wear shorts.
This is my last summer here, thank goodness! Alaska has been an experiance, and it was fun the first couple days I was here, but it has worn out it's welcome and I am ready to leave.
I just hope we get a good base, at least some place better than this.  I am still pulling for Texas or South Carolina, but we shall see come January 9th 2007.

Andrew is in scholl all day so that leaves Matthew and Luke and Matthew is the one that keeps me busy around the clock.  It's gettinga  lot colder here, and was very windy today, it was not like that last year.  It's colder now.
Greg is at work today so it's all three boys for me to watch, although that's nothing new, I get more of a break when he is home.
I found out last weekend my little sister is pregnant, no one is taking it very well it seems.

I am happy for her but wish she would have waited another year.

so far, nothing has really gone on today. Andrew got really sick at school so he came home and was told he can not come back till he is better. He got sick last Thursday, has not fever, nothing but it's coming out both ends. No one else is sick in the house so I am wondering if he got food poisoning?
We are big on the whole hand washing thing too.
Last week I saw a grand total of 5 moose and I saw 3 more yesterday! Woo Hoo! I know big whoopie for some, but they are HUGE! You don't see those every day where I come from!
I was a good 300 feet away from the one I saw yesterday but I got all slap happy seeing it too. I don't know why because they are mean and pretty ugly but so facinating because they just HUGE!
I called Hope and told her about the dress.
She said ""Its too big huh?"" Ya think? She said the lady that sold it to her MIL just said well "" well you will need bigger sizes for dresses"" What she meant was "" I need to make a profit off this dress and even though you really need a size 8, I will give you a NONRETURNABLE size 14 dress."" Nice huh?
To alter it is going to be a fortune so I asked Hope to just get me something she would like and in the colors of her wedding.
Sounded fair.
So all is well and I got a tad too excited but it's going to be hard getting a dress in 8 weeks.
I am going to post some pictures of the moose I saw yesterday."

Well as I wrote before, I am going to be in my sister's wedding, I am her maid of honor. Her husbands mom picked out the dresses, some would think they are pretty and maybe I am overreacting, I just do think they are that spectacular. I told Hope 'NO HALTER type dresses' as some of women know when you have a baby, gain weight, lose weight and have a lovely sight of loose skin near your arms up near your breasts. So around about 3 weeks ago, what happens? Hope could not go to New Jersey because she had to work so her husband(they are renewing their vows) went without her and his mom and sister picked out the dresses. Well Jeremy called my older sister to find out what my size is, she told him a size 6, maybe a 7. I got the dress today. Imagine my surprise or rather shock when I pulled out to see not only a halter type dress, BUT a SIZE 14 dress! Now I know women come in all shapes and sizes and honestly it does not matter what size you are as long as you are happy with yourself.
I used to wear a size 14 in jeans, and those jeans are so big on my hips and waist they fal off but I wear them when I am cleaning. Now I do not know if Jeremy's mom was not listening or he was not listening. 
It felt like he implied or his mom and sister implied I wore that size.
Yes, I have my mommy hips, we all do.
Let me tell you why this bothers me so.
I had Andrew November 1st 1998. Within a month of his birth, I weighed 150 pounds and it stayed there. The doctor asked if I liked sweets and I do! OMG! I eat somethng sweet daily! I do for real.
Well during the first year of Andrew's life my mom and stepdad Kenny at the time, told people how fat I was and next time they saw me, I would be over 200 pounds. My mom kept saying in FRONT OF ME, no less, how big and fat I was. This was Summer of 1999. I figured I must not look too bad or Greg would not want to marry me.
Before I knew it by time Andrew turned one, I weighed 175 pounds. I lost 25 pounds and stayed there till January 2001. I got pregnant with Matthew and within a month of having him started dieting carefully, and got to 142 by May 2002. Greg left to go to the desert and I dropped down to 125 pounds n JUly 2002 and stayed there till I got pregnant with Luke. Luke was born September 23rd 2003, and I started to diet, crash diet the day after I came home from the hospital.  Less than 10 weeks later, I was at 132 pounds. I had to look good cause Greg was in Korea for 6 months, ya know? *wink wink*
I gained about 10 pounds in a month while he was home because he eats a lot of junk food. By end of January 2004, I was at 128 pounds and was happy there and had my goal of 115 pounds by May 2004. I thought that sounded resonable.
Well in late March 2004, my world crashed or at least it felt that way. I had suspicions my husband was messing around on me while he was back in Korea. And I would hack his email account at least 4-6 times a day, just to make sure. I found an email that just about did me in, and called him up, long distance, of course he denied it and said a terroist did it, or someone else did it. Hmmmm funny how they know your Hawaiian saying that I only seen you use ove letters to me, and your name was signed Greg. He automatically deleted it(he had DSL) so he did this while talking to me. I was so hurt I could not see straight. I hit rock bottom. One minute I thought I made a big deal out of it and pushed it too far, and then I knew in my own heart I was right. My sister saw this email as well and told him to just tell the truth.
I felt so sick to my stomach that I could not phyiscally eat, or drink anything. I was so heartbroken, that I stayed up from early Friday morning of the 19th till Monday morning the 22nd and fell asleep. I lost so much weight that by time my dad came to see me in April, I was down to 115 pounds, and still losing. My dad barely reconized me because he said I was too small. To me, I did not look that small, but thought I looked alright. But I changed my looks obviously only after my mother and stepfather's comment to me over the years. In fact my mom told her new husband, Roger that I was a big fat cow when I was pregnant with Andrew just a couple months ago while we did a 3 way call. I was pretty content being a size 14 back then, so their comments definately changed my view and in a negative way. To me, fat, skinny, black or white, everyone is beautiful in their own right, if they think they are beautiful and have a positive attitude about it, that's good. I didn't and so for the rest of my life I will always have a struggle with food and my weight.
My point is after hearing my own family tell me how fat I was, I vowed to never go there again. I struggle with my weight every single day. Some would pass me off as being anorexic. I don't look like a bag of bones, but when I get emotionally traumatized its hard to function, much less think about eating.
I weigh 125 pounds now and seeing that size 14, almost set me into a fit of a weightloss meltdown. Don't worry it didn't!
I thought well I can get it altered, it's going to cost $100 maybe more, and decided to just wear it anyway.
There were holes, missing beads and major rust spots on the inside of the bodice as well. So I emailed Hope and told her it needs to excahngeed or just get me a different dress. I sound so snobby but I am not.
Hope did not pick out the dress, so its not her fault. It just seemed someone disregarded her input and paid no mind to what size I wear.
So!
I saw 3 moose yesterday!! Woo HOO! Hey you have no idea how big those things are! Stay away from baby calves, because Hell hath no furry like a mad momma moose. They are very protective of their babies.
I will let you all know what Hope decides on the dress issue!
I hope no one got upset by what I said. I will not deny I have a self image problem, and I do not go around pointing and bad mouthing those that do not wear a size 7 or a size 2.
As long as we are happy with how we look, that's all that really matters."

"event","Yippie Skippy! Although it always feels like Monday here! My days all run together, and most moms will say the same.
I have laundry I need to finish and put away, which is always FUN! LOL And see how bare my walls in my house are. I love and I mean really LOVE to decorate. My sister thought it was all great too and I did not see what the big deal was till I got into it myself.
I live in military quarters so I am very limited on what I can do, such as painting walls and what not. I am really in country decor and primitive stuff and I just have no clue where to put stuff, so the walls will be bare for awhile.
Since there is not too much to do in Alaska, I will prefer to shop and decorate. Mind you all the stuff I want, I have to order online. Did I mention how expensive it is for shipping out here? I ordered 1 shirt from Victoria Secret online, the shipping was $23, for ONE FREAKIN SHIRT. Another good reason why I do not wish to stay here longer than need be.
I have no idea where we will go next, Hawaii would be ok, but aside from tourist attraction, it has little to offer. But it is my husband's home and his mom won't be around forever.
I would not mind the Carolina's, they seem nice, there is a base in Arkanas that is really nice but Greg says no because he will be gone all the time. Not that it would bother me because he's gone all the time anyway.
Or my base of preferance is anywhere in Washington State. I don't know why, but I loved living there, it was short lived but the area I lived in was big and there were malls for miles around. Not in Alaska do you have that luxury.
Got two more years almost to the nose to be here. I think we are supposed to find out where we go next once we hit the last 6 months or so of this tour. So roughly, a year and a half till we know. Greg keeps coming home with what would be open for his rank and MOS (his job) I keep telling him stop showing me the overseas ones because I am not living overseas anymore. Like I siad before, you want solitude, Alaska is the place to be.  If you lived here your whole life, you would not mind it so much. But seeing as I have not, and its so cut off from the world, I do mind. 
We have sad looking Walmarts, a blog that I read, has a Walmart that has nice wooden floors, our Walmart looks like its ghetto, just sad looking and we have 3 and they are all sad looking.
I do not know what my point of this entry is, with being a big talker its hard to say what a point is with me when I am talking.
My brother's girlfriend pissed me off earlier this week. She is a travel agent and said that C* (Andrew's dad) is PCSing to Hawaii. I asked her to clarify and she said she has a travel reservation for him and his wife, one way. I told her the Child Support office in Tacoma has a verified address for C* in El Paso, I even heard from C* just shortly after Mother's Day and he told me he is there. I know big surprise, I rarely hear from C* anyway but I am deciding if I want to test waters and let Andrew see him next spring. My brother Danny is stationed about 2 hours from El Paso, so we will see.
Anyway, I wanted to smack her because she is so blind when it comes to military issues.
I know people who can access unit addresses for military and it is proven C* is in Texas. He has not been there long enough for him to be stationed elsewhere, he has been there, 6 weeks. 
My brother's girlfriend also decided, that my mom has 5 children and my mom wavers back and forth on favoring any of us. She shunned me, Danny and Hope and basically only speaks to Mark and Meri Ann. I was saying how this hurt me because I have heard from my mom 4-6 times in two years. Yes I do call but she screens her calls and only talks when my older sister calls, so I stopped calling. why waste .14 cents a minute waiting to see if she will pick up? ANYWAYS, brothers girlfriend says "" Well your mom has depression, she can't help it."" Ok lets backup, so that means because of her mental health that gives her the authority to favor 2 out of her 5 kids? Don't think so. Can we all say brown noser? That would be Andrea.
My mom is bi-polar and her moods are all over but that does not clarify her actions. She is aware of her actions and Miss Brown Noser will not get in my good graces by defending my mom like that.
But the whole military thing with the said above, pissed me off because Alaska is costly to live, and she knows(because I told her) I was taking C* for a upward modification in child support, upward meaning to increase because as of now, its below guidelines and what I get is not enough for Andrew. I am not out to make him broke, but to get the child support up to comply with state guidelines. That is all. So by her opening her mouth and talking about something she knows little to nothing about, made me a tad irked to say the least.
My sister sent the dress she picked out for me to wear in her wedding in July. She got in a size 6, and I do not know if I can wear a size 6 dress. I don't think it will fit especially with my mother bearing hips. SO I have dieting to drop about 10-12 more pounds to make sure it will fit by late July.
This is my little sister, Hope. And Hope just kicks butt, no other person like her. She is a legend in her own right and just overall the greatest person I know. 
And because of Hope she helped lessen the wounded heart my mother caused me over the course of the past couple years. 
We talk weekly and email a lot and she made me her maid of honor, which is well, an honor. I just love her.
I am going to close here and think of something else to write about and hopefully my thoughts won't fly all over the place."

"event","I know I have not updated in quite some time. We just moved into the house on May 10th and so far it's not too bad but I am a but pissed as the movers got black dirt all OVER the carpet,upstairs and downstairs. I called Housing who said the moving company is liable for it and it will cost $160 to clean the whole house, not bad, or we pay for it and TRY to get the moving company to reimburse us. The guy who is like a supervisor came over yesterday and tried telling me that the spots were already there and his guys say they didn't do it and blah blah blah. Let me add that housing had the carpet cleaned the day before we moved in and I saw what it looked like before the movers ruined it.
I have had it with housing and the moving company and I am calling TMO on Tuesday to tell them, and something better be done because I am going to report it to public affairs and I am heading up with a congressional and reporting it to the BBB. This is BS. And housing just drags their feet. Some would say I am being anal but the carpet is beige and looked almost brandnew after it was cleaned and now it looks like someone has had a tea party all over the floor, EVERYWHERE that we have used our own rugs to cover it up.
This base sucks!
I am still going through some child support stuff, it's confusing me and stressing me out at the same time.
Which is no fun.
My sisters wedding is in 8 weeks and I have no idea how I can afford $530 roundtrip ticket.
Maria, do you know why Shana deleted her livejournal? I emailed her and have not heard back from her. I was just curious if she had another one or why she deleted her other one.
I betterget going, got a lot of cleaning to do!"

"event","I had no intention son neglecting this journal. Really. We went and looked at the house we are moving into next Monday. It's ok but the rooms are so small, it'll be interesting to see how our 3 piece pine bedroom set will fit into a 13x10 room, and that is the master bedroom! Lovely huh?
I have a big grip, rant whatever you want to call it. It's about this girl I met in high school when I was living in Indiana. She seemed ok at first, but seemed like she made things up for attention. Let me give you a prime example. She said her mom was dating and pregnant with Troy Aikman, now if you all don't know him, he played or plays for the Dallas Cowboys, and I only know that because my stepdad LOVES those Cowboys. I knew it was a big bunch of bull back then but felt maybe her homelife was that bad she had to make shit up to get attention so I paid little to no mind to it.
This gal was married back in 2000, cheated on her husband with another active duty military member(her husband was navy) and brushed it off like it was ok to live a seperate life behind your spouse's back. I might add she 'claims' she got pregnant with this guy's kid (not spouse) about 6-8 times in less than a year, while it may be possible, it seemed she always had miscarriages. Which in itself is very sad. Then she got divorced and got married again, got pregnant again twice with #2 and lost both. 
Moves on to another guy, he dumps her, moves on to another guy, he dumps her. Moves onto this Army guy who is a recruiter, she says he makes a lot of money blah blah, met him one week and whatdoya know? She got pregnant the next week. She claims she will get half his paycheck for child support. Umm I am here to clarify there are state and federal regulations and especially with DFAS, they allow with federal guidelines up to 65% of the pay, but state guidelines run differently and I told her so and she won't get jack. This guy really is not that seriously into her but she is latching herself onto him and claiming she is his family too because she is pregnant with his kid, and his mom has terminal cancer and is dying, she thinks she has every right to be there when this pooor woman passes off to the next world. Thinks this guy needs and has to tell his family she is pregnant and all that jazz, like NOW.
I tried telling her no one likes force and no one likes it when you assume a position in others life like that. It's not right and I would kick her to the curb.
This guy she is 'claiming' to be with, is rather good looking, she on the other hand, acts like she is hot to trot, and she is so far from that! She is major liar which diteiates her physical appearance, but she is not a beauty to behold to begin with, is always talking about wanting to lose weight but does so little to achieve this, she is about 200 pounds. Granted I have had kids and most moms will tell you, that small pouch will never be a six pack, but we earned them proudly!
I am not jealous, so far from it because I know I am not ugly, I have a good looking family. I just do not like the fact she is taking advantage of people and is a HUGE liar.
To top it off she obviously has no direction in life. She has dropped out of college, three times. She had a good scholarship to UofW, for nursing. Oh sweet Jesus, school is just too much of a hassle and once again, she dropped out. I am thinking she must be really stupid or something. I would have completed it and got that degree. She only finishes things half way.
I don't care if she comes across this, she is a big liar and while I do not wish ill will on her, I do hope someone finds out how decietful and unworthy she really is. I can not see her as a mother because of this constant lying and whatnot.
If she really is pregnant I hope she can get things in order and get her head on straight and do the best she can for this baby. Because right now I see a train wreck coming......"

I am tired for one, and then the added stress of moving is a pain too. I have Wallies in the kids room so I have to remove them and everything else this weekend. I figure whatever is small enough, we can put in the van and in the house verses waiting for movers to do it. They take forever and I don't want them in the house longer than need be.
It just sucks because I am too used to this house and now we have to move to another house. Andrew has to be driven to school for a month too. Which sucks because after June 3rd we will be screwed on Andrew getting to school without a vehicle and Greg being gone for the week, I have no idea how Andrew will get to school. The new house and his school are a good 20 minutes apart verses the 5 minute walk being here. So I don't know what to do!
In regard to Andrew's dad, well I feel like I did all the searching and paperwork for nothing. TX was saying they would not enforce, modify or anything unless I came to TX for legal proceedings. I don't have money dripping out my ears so I am going to have to work something out.
WA says if TX declines to take on the case, they can't do anything. TX says to register in Alaska but I don't know. Because we are leaving in 2 years and this will take a good 9 months at best it's very complicated.
So I am trying to get as much info as I can.

"event","Wanna hear something bad? I don't have a normal family. I am one of five children. I am the middle child and have always been sensitive and compassionate towards others, and I get hurt very easily. And it does not take much to make me cry.
My mom and I used to be close, it seems every year she picks a favorite and I got the lucky slot one year.
It all began May 2003. Over my dogs AKC papers. Got over that hump, and moved into May 2004. My brother, Daniel was going to loan my mom $2000 for closing costs on her house, given that she pay it back in full. Danny happened to mention to my mom that she never calls him to see how he is, only when she wanted something. He did not want to loan her the money but knew if he did not she would outcast him like she did Kristin(me)
Well he go the information for the money to be wired, and headed off to Korea that same day. My mom would be every so mean to me every time she talked to me on the phone and on the computer, truth came out she never got the money and chose to blame me, her and my older sister Meri Ann said I talked Danny out of it. Which I didn't say anything to him about loaning her the money except I wish I had money to loan her as well. This stirred up major problems between my sister, my mom and myself. My mom never sent my kids a birthday card, or myself for that matter after this blew up. Hope and Danny told her I had nothing to do with it and what it boiled down to was my mother gave Danny the wrong information to her bank.
I never got an apology from Mere or my mom, and to this day, they treat me very cruely.
I have prayed that they would change their ways but a year later and things are worse. Hope calls me today and tells me that my mom said that I run hot and cold and that I said Hope was mad at Meri Ann and I never said that. Hope was not sure on who to believe, seeing how I will cover for others and whatnot but she came around and decided I was telling the truth. This all happened an hour ago.
My mom has bi-polar and gets worse every year. Mere is just a backstabbing witch who will do anything to gain my mom's approval.
I am not going to go to my sisters wedding in July because my mom has hurt me enough and if I saw her I would come unglued and kick her ass. I am a pretty nice person, I am, and I would not hurt someone, but I can honestly say I hate my older sister and I hate my mother.
It's not all peaches living out here in Alaska and quite honestly, I would like some support from my so called family, having that would make it bearable to live here.
I spoke to Danny tonight and he said he knows I am not the type to stir trouble up, my mom is good at that. At least I have him in my court.
I am sorry this is a downer, I am just at a loss right now."

Right now it has been hard getting anything done because Luke is sick with who knows what, it looks like a cold, but it could be allergies. He is not totally out of it but is miserable and I don't blame him.
I am going to start taking down my stuff off my walls downstairs and in my bathroom next weekend or so, and start stripping off the Wallies I have in the boy's rooms. I told Greg whatever is small enough we can just put in the van and haul it over to the new house whether than wait on the movers to pack it all up.
Speaking of the van, we are on the lookout for a new van. Nothing is wrong with our Dodge, but Greg is into his Honda vehicles because they are good quality made and last a good long time. So we are looking to get a 2006 Honda Odesesy around Christmas. We have no debt anymore, well ok, we do, but it's Victoria Secret and Zales and my two massive dental bills.
One is from 2002 and I am still paying on it. But it's for my wisdom teeth and the dentist that did it does not care if I pay only a $1, as long as I pay monthly, they won't care or tack interest charge on it. I think it's at $275 now. It was about $800. And the one from, excuse my words here, Dr. Dumb F^&%, who misdiagnosed my problem, is at $513. I figure at this rate it'll be January before everything is done and paid for.
In other news, good news, I found C*! Well I didn't but some very good hearted prior military, has access to the World Wide Locator tracked him down!! And C* ain't in VA, just like I thought. So now I have to close my case there and reregister where he is. I hope it goes smoothly and does not take eternity but I know it could be a good 6 months before anything goes into place. I had my congressman's assistaint call me yesterday and if I provide them with enough information they will get every stinking detail I need on him.
Other than that, nothing is going on!!!
I better get going I need to get busy cleaning pretty soon!!

I got to make this quick cause Greg is going to be home in about 45 minutes and I have some major picking up to do. Thank you Matthew and Andrew.
Greg came home late Wednesday and had to go to a housing meeting the next night. We moved in our on base housing last July and our neighbor informed us in 2006 everyone would have to move. Well guess what? It must be 2006. We all have to move. And everyone is all moving to different housing areas on base. Andrew will start school at another school in the fall and since the bus for the current school he attends does not go out to our new area, Greg has to bring Andrew to school and pick him up too till June 9th.
We are moving May 9th. I am so thrilled I could just scream!
Gotta love military life!
The only plus is we get a attached garage.
I don't think I mentioned, but I will anyway, the dentists in Anchorage, all pretty much suck.
Let me tell you why about this one in particular.
Summer 2003, I started having off minor discomfort in my lower right canine, well my dentist at the time, did not know what to think. I had my root planning( a good cleaning) and was fine till I got here. I saw this one dentist in Anchorage and he kept saying the discomfort I felt wasa referred pain coming from tooth 30 which is my lower back right molar. Said to let him do a repeat root canal and it would go away.
So I let him. In October 2004. Within maybe an hour of the novacaine wearing off tooth 31, was throbbing so bad. I was reduced to tears and bawling my eyes out. It was bad and far worse then labor. I call the stupid dentist back and let him know what was up. He says come in right away. I do and he says I need a root canal because he must have killed the nerve while doing the repeat root canal in the tooth in the front of it. 
Well, a repeat root canal here is like $1200-1300, a regular one is like $1100. Tricare gives you a $1200 a year cap and I tossed down $550 thus far.
Well after the root canals, I was still having discomfort, this time it had radiated all on my lower bottom teeth. I see a different dentist, who informs me all I needed was a cleaning to remove the tarter and whatnot, not root canals and that the bad dentist took me for a ride and knew what he was doing, as I was so desperate to fix my problem.
I contact United Concordia, who say they will look into it. In other words, he gets off with ripping the insurance and me off.
I decided heck, if he was going to misdiagnose me, I ain't paying the bill, as he messed up not I.
So what happens next? They send me straight to collections! Yippie! And I have them calling me everyday at 9AM.
The bill was $413 and they tacked on about $150 more. I ain't paying over $550 for his screwup. Nor do I have the cash flow to pay it all at once.
I am paying them $50 a month, take it or leave it. 
I can not afford a lawyer and I highly doubt JAG will handle this. Sorry that was a vent, a worthless one at that.
Still can't find C at all.
Now I don't care. But that debt just jumped up another $241, so it's getting bigger every month.
I have no idea what is going on there.
I better get going so I can have stuff taken care of by time Greg comes home.

Which means I still have plenty of time to get all my cleaning done, I am almost done with the laundry. I need to take trash out, mop, vac, pick up toys and straighten out under all the sinks and I am done. Yeah for me!!!
As much as I would love to loaf around, I can't or I get in bad moods. Plus this is Alaska, nothing else to do!
Maria, you and I will have to meet up sometime this summer, Fairbanks is only I think 2 hours away from Anchorage?
I have to agree with you, living here definately makes you want to go home again. I am from a small town in Michigan, and I just want to be elsewhere where there is civilization. Yes, it's beautiful here, but isolated and boring. If you are into that, move here, if not steer clear.
I would rather go back to NORTH DAKOTA then be here. Hey we had a SuperTarget and Victoria Secret. They don't have either of those in Alaska, anywhere. We have Walmarts, but they are pretty ghetto looking.
The 5th Avenue Mall is pretty nice, the Dimond Mall, sucks, and is falling apart and gross looking all over.
I am waiting ever so patiently, 8 more months till we find out what bases are open stateside, cause I ain't doing this overseas thing anymore.  8 months seems like an eternity, but the summer will fly by and by time Thanksgiving rolls around we should be knowing something, what our options are, then we wait some more! I think 3-5 months before we leave we will know where we go next.
I have my heart set on McChord AFB, I lived on Fort Lewis and it's like maybe 2-5 miles from McChord and I love Washington state. So much to do! 
Little Rock AFB seems pretty nice but Greg says no. Well I say no to any overseas assignments, no Europe, no Asia, no Guam, no Spain. Some are ok living their lives overseas, but it's not my cup of tea.
I have done this for too long and I long to be near my family more.
In other news, I still have not found out where C* is but I am determined to find him. If he is deployed I willl feel totally stupid for getting my panties in a wad, but it's highly unlikely that he is deployed. I am determined to find him in the next couple of weeks and if push comes to shove, I am contacting the IG. I hate to do it, but ya know that court order says to keep the state notified when he moves, within 10 days I believe. 
WA state said they are sending him some paperwork, hopefully it will come back with his forwarding address. I hope they have better luck than I, cause I did that about 3 weeks ago and still nothing.
I better get going because Matthew is up to no good!"

"event","Well its almost noon and I still have so much to do yet. Lots of cleaning. It's hard to get everything done when I am usually braeking up fights between Andrew and Matthew. Luke on the other hand is so low maintence, he can amuse himself if need be. He is such a good baby.
I called the CSE (Child Support Enforcement) in Washington State and had to give them a heads up that C* has fled again, tried asking them to contact his company in the hospital, they can't do it saying the Army can't give them that information on where he is. What a bunch of hogwash! But the caseworker did say she is sending him a letter and hopefully that will show his new address.
I have an Interstate case, and I have never dealt with this before. 
Everything is still showing up that C* is still attached to Walter Reed, so I have no idea what is going on. His phone is disconnected, his coworkers say he no longer works at the hospital, but yet he is still attached. Makes little sense to me unless someone knows I am looking for him and they are doing a CYA for him. 
C* does pay support because it is garnished out of his check every month, and this has only been going on for about 3 and half years, Andrew is almost 6 1/2 years old. So I feel I got every right doing a search on him, he likes to run and hide.
The amount he pays is BELOW Washington and Virginia guidelines, and it's been about 4 years since the order went effective, so it's time to bring it up to guidelines, if I can find his sorry self.
He does not pay for Andrew's medical, even though he was court ordered to enroll him in TriCare and DEERS, he never did. Quite honestly I can't sit around and wait for him to do so, beause it would not ever happen and Greg would have to disenroll Andrew first and wait for C* to get him in TriCare.
So I figure I am being quite fair because C* could get into trouble for not honoring a court order.
I am not some ex bashing person, truthfully. I have tried like mad to be on good terms with C*. When I say that, I have kept him informed about Andrew constantly. I mail pictures, and have since the day Andrew was born, little updates, I even sent them to his brother, mother and uncle. I never even get a thank you, nothing. Big whoopie to some, but Andrew is the only grandson, the only nephew on C*'s side, the only boy aside from C*'s older brother.
C* flutters in Andrew's life as well as my own, like nothing changed in the 7 years that past, and he flutters out just as fast as he flutters in. Makes me feel horrible for Andrew.
Andrew looks like a carbon copy of his father, except C* has brown eyes, Andrew has hazel eyes like my older brother.
It makes me wonder how C* can go about his day to day life, knowing he has a son, one that he does not even know at all, aside from the few phone calls we get every 2 years, one that he makes NO EFFORT in knowing about, by his own choice.
I guess it bothers me, because I always kept telling myself, he would come around and he will be full of regret. 
My brother, Mark told me, 'Kris, you can't force the guy to do something he don't want to do. Leave him be for a while and he will end up hunting you down, wanting to see Andrew. When that happens, it's Andrew's choice. And Andrew will slam the door in his face, wanting to know where he has been his whole life. He will know that you tried everything in your power for him to have a relationship with his dad.'
I thought about calling his brother to see what the real deal is, but I am too chicken to follow through with it.
I don't know about C* and his crew, but I will feel pretty bad pushing my own aside like that.
I would even forgo the support just so he would have a relationship with Andrew.
Let the sleeping dog lay I guess.
I thought about going out to Maryland to see Mark. I went almost 5 years without seeing him, and he is by far, my favorite person in the world. He looks a lot like Tom Cruise and I laugh a lot around him and I get terribly sentimental and cry very easily around him. I have two brother, Mark is almost 30, Danny is 26, he is in the Air Force and out in Kunsan AB, Korea, says its a hellhole and he hates it, and is staying another year. I have two sisters, Meri Ann is almost 29, she lives in Olympia, WA, she is prior Army, got out and is getting a degree in something. I forget what. She's cool but you don't want to make her mad, you know what they say about redheads right? It holds true in her case.
Hope is the baby of our clan, she is 25, just got married in August( In fact all 3 of us girls got married in August, all have the same cut of stone in our engagement rings too, being the Princess cut) she lives on Fort Belvior with her husband, who is Army. I love Hope, I do but she assumes certain things that make me want to smack her around a bit! I don't and won't but I don't know where she comes up with stuff.
I think my siblings are pretty cool and I love them all, they each helped shape and mold the person I am today.
I named my kids after my brothers, so you know they rank high on my list.
I have a Andrew Mark Ryan W**
I have a Matthew Daniel Kainoa C****
I have a Luke Gregory Kaipo C****

My mom loved the name Andrew, so she called the shots on that, Mark, is after my brother, Ryan is after a cousin of mine that had accidently(so they say) shot himself when we were both 17 years old. I still have not gotten over that. Partially because he had a alot going for him, graduation was around the corner, had a free ride to CMU, and partially because my dad's house is a good 10-12 feet away from Ryan's house and I was home when this happened. I will have to explain that later.
Matthew is a name a chose because I was trying to keep with the Bible thing. But Matthew is the Bible was also a tax collector, also known as Levi, like the jeans. My stepdad, Roger, that's his nickname Levi because that's all he wears, Daniel after Danny, Kainoa is Hawaiian meaning ""Mischievious"", little did we know that is Matthew in a nutshell and he is the biggest Hellraiser known to man. The boy has NO FEAR, I swear.
Luke is after my grandma, my grandpa used to call her 'Luke The Drifter' cause she was always on the go. I never heard him say this, but its a story in the family, and Luke is a biblical name, Gregory is after Greg, Kaipo is Hawaiian for ""Sweetheart"" and that he is!

With saying that I have to go cause the house is not going to get cleaned just by doing nothing."

"event","Well, I got almost everything I needed to get done today, cleaning wise. I just need to pick up the living room(vac) and mop the dining room. I need to hurry up and do it because I have to go get Andrew at school at 330PM and it's not too grand at 335 because there are hoards of people and their vehicles so it's overly crowded. And the sidewalks are NEVER plowed so I walk in the road off to the side, of course with the stroller.
I am not really going to divorce Greg, I say things out of anger especially when he thinks it's ok to get mad at me for nothing.
I left him alone for a couple days and everything is back to normal!
I got about 8 calls from this company in town for an interview. I so want to take it but I don't have anyone to watch the boys till next Wednesday. They must be desperate or they would not keep calling!
I still do not know where Andrew's dad is. All systems show he is still attached to Walter Reed, but him and his wife moved out of the area of Alexandria, VA, so I do not know what to think.
I had to do a congressional, I know bad Kristin, but no one was giving me answers and this guy has dodged child support for 3 years before and I am not about to let him do it again. And this is an officer people.  I am so glad he is setting a good example for the Army. LOL
Greg comes home in 6 more days, YEAH!!! 
I better get back to cleaning!! Yippie Yeah!"

I figured since I was hitting a dead end find Andrew's father, I just went an tossed a congressional on the table. I think I have waited too long and no one is really helping that can, so I just did it as a last resort deal.
And me and Greg are fighting. He is all the way in Oklahoma and is mad because the Dell bill was not paid. Well if I had access to your checkbook I could have taken care of it. Plus I had the flu last week so it's not my fault! He begs to differ. So it got pretty ugly. He hung up on me, that started war there! I called him back and left a nasty message, something with the word DIVORCE in it. I sound mean but his anal attitude gets old and I have about had it up to my ears.
He knows when the bills are due and all that jazz because they ARE HIS BILLS. Not mine and so since he knows Dell is due on the 29th of every month, but failed to make checks out to all these credit cards, it ain't my fault.
It sounds dumb and I sound mean but he was not being none too pleasant to me either. I just evened the score some. :O)
In other words, don't make me mad because I am vengeful. :O)
I gotta go put the boys to bed and pick up a little bit!"

"event","I was getting all geared up for Spring and the past couple days, we have gotten dumped on with snow. How lovely. I am guessing but I think there is like 8-12 inches or more outside. It was getting warmer and so much nicer and then we get snow. The joys of living in Alaska.
It's pretty here and an ok place to vacation, but not to live. It's a culture shock and hard to adjust to being in this place.
In 9 more months we get the list that has the bases we can go to. I won't go overseas, that is out of the question, this is as far as I go! Hawaii would not be too bad, Greg is from Oahu, so he will be in familiar surroundings and can teach the boys of his culture and such. The carolinas sound nice too.
I am still on the hunt for Andrew's dad. I have no idea where he is. It seems everyone has lost him. No one knows where he is.
The child support debt with Virginia gets bigger every month and he is going to be in a world of hurt soon. I am just trying to be nice and cut him some slack but if no one wants to talk, what good am I to him?
Anyone know how to track down Active Duty military, leave a message/comment, I just got to find this guy. I am not his ex wife, just ex girlfriend.
Greg is still gone, 9 more days.
He's been to Korea for a year, left me very pregnant, with two kids, and I handled it pretty well and wanted him gone more often, but we had a TARGET and cool stores in North Dakota. Here in Alaska, there is nothing so this trip he is on, has me very worn down.
9 more months, just 9 more. Did you all know I don't like it here? :O)"

"event","Well I am into Day 4 of Greg being gone. It's not going too smoothly though. I caught some sort of bug, so I am sick. Being sick and taking care of everyone else alone is not fun. I have loads of cleaning to do and I have not gotten past the bathroom. Kinda impossible when Andrew and Matthew are always raising cain upstairs and having to stop fights and make sure they not getting into stuff they are not supposed to.
But I am determined to get everything out of the way by 5pm.
I am also looking into getting a job in town. Being a SAHM for almost 7 years, and I would like to venture out into the world and make a contibution to the household. Now I am not saying being a SAHM mom is not making a contribution, it is a HUGE one and it is difficult but rewarding at the same time.
Some think SAHM are lazy and do nothing, I have yet to meet a lazy SAHM.
I am not sure if this place will hold onto to me till Greg gets back. I hope they do, it would be nice, but if not, oh well, I guess.
My big mission is trying to locate Andrew's father. If I have not mentioned already, he is in the Army, is a nurse and was working at Walter Reed and then PCSed within the past two months and I have no idea where he went. Why do I care you ask? Because he is supposed to be covering Andrew under TriCare, and has failed to do so, and because it's been almost 4 years since the child support order was modified, and it needs to be done again. If I can find him.
Anyone that is military and has computer access at work through a gov or mil domain could find him, so I have a couple people on the outlook for me.
I think he might be in Washington State or Texas, but I won't know for sure for a couple days.
This guy, we will call him C* is a Captain in the military and has dodged the state and anything else that deals with Andrew. I do get support, its court ordered. He is not a horrible guy, but not someone I would be proud to even know. 
If you look up DEADBEAT DAD, in the dictionary, his name should be right next to it.
This is the guy that heckled me into having an abortion because a baby would mess up his life plans. He still moved on, nothing held him back.
I have over the course of the past 6 and half years sent pictures to him and his family, and kept them updated on Andrew. But I am done with that and will not pursue it any more. None of them have ever sent Andrew a birthday card, ever said thank you for the pictures, nothing.
I know somewhere down the road C* will regret what he did to his son, no doubt in my mind. How he looks himself and others in the face daily, is beyond me. I myself would feel awful, knowing I have a son who I don't even know because I do not want to be in his life or have him in mind.
C* is married, and has claimed in past conversations, that his wife has tried talking to him about having a relationship with Andrew. I for one just don't buy that. If it wre true, I think she would have called me or touched base somehow and said 'hey how can we do this for C* and Andrew?' I have no bad blood with either of them, his wife is actually pretty nice from what I recall from only speaking to her once.

I thought about calling his brother to see where this all stands, but I would feel awkward. I thought about just mailing them a note telling them I will not send pictures or updates, I will leave them be, it's pretty obvious they don't want to know this little boy at all.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
I better get back to cleaning! Oh yippie!"

"event","I know I have been slacking again, but I haven't in truth though. I have tried updating every other day, only for it not to post because of LJ maintence. Is it just me or is everyone having this problem too?
Right now, I am kinda stressed out. Greg is gone for a lovely three weeks and Andrew's dad has PCSed, and it messes up the chld support case I had registered in Virginia, so as usual, I have got to track him down and get this situated.
I don't mind Greg being gone, I have done it so often, it really does not bother me. But I am no where near my family and I have no friends here, I must be a loser! No a lot of it is its winter and most people keep to themselves out here during that time frame. Alaska is nice but I am not one for pure solitude 24-7. If I could, I would have Greg move us out the state.
I just don't like it here, at all.
Too isolated.
Just two more years, blah!
I can't post pictures on here for some reason so I am going to find a website that I can and post the link on here.
I gotta get going cause the boys need dinner and need to go to bed!"

"event","I just got back from visiting my sister in Virginia. I left for 7 days and my flight from Newark to Seattle left just as my flight from DC to Newark landed. I get in touch was pretty livid because the airline did not even give a waiver for hotel accomodations or anything. A word to the wise, stay clear of Continental Airlines, they suck.
I also saw my brother, he is 29, almost 30 and I have not seen him in almost 5 years. I also saw my niece who I have not seen since she was 6 weeks old, and she is almost 5 years old. Long story, another entry for another day.
My son Andrew's father lives in Alexandria just minutes from my sister and I was trying to get in touch with him so Andrew could finally meet his father, but to no avail. I will have to tell the story later, because it's almost like a soap opera. But his father basically cut ties because I refused to have an abortion.
He is in the Army, and is a Captain at Walter Reed Medical Center in DC. My brother works there too.
I am not the greatest at writing so if I go a few days with no entry, it's no laziness that is plagueing me, it's my three boys.
I need to get Andrew up and write his note for school.

My name is Kristin, I just turned 27 years old, happily married to Greg, who is 28 and is in the Air Force, for 10 years now. We have been together since July 1998. We have three little boys. Andrew is not Greg's biological son, however he is the only father Andrew has known, I will get that later. Andrew is 6 years old, he was born November 1st 1998, he is in Kindergarten now. Matthew is 3 years old, he was born November 2nd 2001, he loves finding trouble and creating it. Luke is 16 months old and he was born September 23rd 2003.
We moved to Alaska last June from North Dakota. I am a former Army brat so I am used to moving every couple of years. This is our first move together and as a married couple. I myself prefer North Dakota, although cold, the state had Victoria Secret and a Super Target!
We are only here for two years so that is good, I don't think I could stand it longer than that. It's like being in a different world out here. Very secluded and cut off from the rest of the world, but it is beautiful. 
That is about all for now 'cause my two younger ones are being wild!"

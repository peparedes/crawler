"event","Ok, me and Ben....still together. But not for long. He has changed, and so have I. I just don't think he understands that he is hurting me. I mean, a few days ago we didn't have any school, so we were going to spend the whole day together...well he spent it with Allyson and John (just a few people I don't really like). John has been talking bad behind my back to Ben. Him and I used to be really good friends, then he just started hating me. I don't know why, and he won't tell me. Allyson really likes Ben, but I wouldn't say that I hate her for it. She is nice and all, but I don't know. I just have a bad vibe with her. 

I don't know if I informed you all about Ben's little night out a few months ago. He cheated on me with my two best friends. (well, they are no longer my friends) I forgave Ben because he talked to me about it, and they have yet to call me. Now Melanie doesn't really have any friends right now because Danielle and Rachel are mad at her. Rachel is a slut. (seriously) She doesn't treat anyone as good as they deserve. Whenever I talk about her, Danielle gets mad at me. She took their side over mine. (I thought she was my best friend, but whatever) We still talk, but it isn't the same. She knew about it too, and she still didn't tell me. WHAT A FRIEND! 

Ben is coming over today to help me with my homework. I don't know how well me and him are going to be today. Yesterday was a bit messed up. 

So maybe I'll try updating a little more.

"event","So today me and Ben are supposed to go to Flossmoor and go to the caboose thinger. I don't know about that though because it looks like rain. OH, well. I think he is still sleeping and it is like 2:00!! haha. I need to go over there and wake him up. Sigh. 

Danielle's little brother is being an asshole. I was on the phone with her, and he kept picking it up and talking to us and being an annoying fag! I hate him. And keep in mind this is a 7th grader, not a 3rd grader. 

My mom won't be home all day because she has to go to this practice work thinger. She works at a medical place, filling out forms, and talking on the phone. They said that they'd give her 6 months to learn the job, but her boss Patty is about to fire her. (It has only been 3 months) My mom isn't even making big mistakes. They are just stupid little minor ones. So like I said she is at a new place today so they can catch her up a little more. They said that she shouldn't be fired for those things, but it isn't up to them. Ben's mom is the real boss, so she has to fire my mom if Patty complains again. Blah. I know that is confusing.

I am going to take a shower and call Ben, so Buh-bye!

"event","Right now I am on the phone with Ben. It is sooo cool except he is depressing me. I am trying to be supportive about him and his problems, but it is getting very difficult. URG!! I am kind of bored at the moment. I wish someone would talk to me. well, I am talking to Ethan and Ben, but whatever. BLAH!!!!! I am soooo fucking bored. LEAVE ME COMMENTS. haha!! Ben is singing Ashlee Simpson. It is soooo funny. Well, sorry I am not very interesting..but you can get over it.

My mom just made an appointment for a physical for me:( I hate getting shots! Damn this sucks. I need to take a nap until Ben calls me. (sigh of boredom) Someone please leave a comment so it looks like I have friends.

"event","WOW! I didn't know it was possible to be this bored. I just finished editing my xanga..so now I am going to edit my livejournal. Go me! lol. Me and Ben never went to the thrift store! :( I am sad about that, but  maybe we'll go tomorrow. He came over today at about 7:00 and we just hung out. We didn't do anything spectacular...but then again I do love spending all my time with him. He is soooo sweet. He was telling all the things he liked about me...sigh. I loved it. I have always wanted a guy like Ben, and now that I have him,I am afraid that I will lose all of this. I want to be with him forever, and I hope that things work out for me and him. I said this about my last boyfriend, but he obviously had different plans. I just wish I knew what I did to make him break up with me. He is a loser any ways. I am glad that me and him are over, so I can be with Ben. Seriously, he is the perfect guy. He loves going to see chick flicks with me, listens to my kind of music, and I know this shouldn't be a big thing...but he gets me whatever I want. hehe. That sounds like I am using him, but I would never do that. He is my everything. I just wish today he was more happy. He made me kind of depressed with all his problems. I am going to try my best to solve them...but I don't know if I can do all of that. Well, I think I am out of things to say except....GO BUY THE ASHLEE SIMPSON CD!! haha.

"event","Well, this is my first entry. So I am just going to talk...I am that cool. Today me and Ben are supposed to go to the thrift store. I am not that poor to where I have to shop there, I just like the low, low prices. haha. And I really don't have money to shop like the rich. So whatever. I can't even find Ben right now. I think he is out with Bonnie and John. I hate it when he does that. He tells me that he is going to do something with me and then he goes out with his sister. I guess that is cool though. I just feel sooo damn lazy, like I should be doing something. I haven't done anything this summer. Well, I got two of my poems published. It is awesome to have that. I don't know. I think I am going to take a shower....haha. I need to cleanse. wow. That sounds really dirty. So I'll up-date later I guess.

love ya,

neenokingkompwa: i'm usually over at his house 
kimmistephens: where does he live? 
neenokingkompwa: green run 
kimmistephens: oh 
kimmistephens: is he working today? 
neenokingkompwa: yeah 
neenokingkompwa: he's working now 
neenokingkompwa: 8:30-5, i think 
kimmistephens: ok, i figured 
kimmistephens: so what have u been up to? 
kimmistephens: besides matt 
kimmistephens: is he nice? 
neenokingkompwa: yeah, he's nice 
neenokingkompwa: i don't think i'd stick around for 6 months if he wasn't nice 
neenokingkompwa: but other than that i've been working 
neenokingkompwa: and going to grammy's 
neenokingkompwa: and avoiding mom's as much as possible 
kimmistephens: why going to grammy's 
kimmistephens: you didn't used to go over there 
kimmistephens: why avoid mom 
neenokingkompwa: would you want to be here with mom? 
kimmistephens: no, but that's why i didn't move back in with her 
neenokingkompwa: well i don't have anywhere else to go 
kimmistephens: have you been saving up for an apt? 
neenokingkompwa: i can't 
kimmistephens: i certainly wouldn't reccommend moving with grammy, she'll kick you out quicker than anything 
neenokingkompwa: i'm lucky if i get a hundres dollars at the end of the month 
kimmistephens: why not 
neenokingkompwa: i wouldn't give her a reason to kick me out 
kimmistephens: what's wrong? 
neenokingkompwa: but she won't let me move in anyway 
kimmistephens: and what reason did i give her? 
neenokingkompwa: well, from what i understand, you yelled at her after you locked your dog in a room and he got your candy 
neenokingkompwa: but i only know her side of the story 
kimmistephens: well, if you know her daughter at all, you know she probably not one that's all that trustworthy 
kimmistephens: i found that out the hard way 
neenokingkompwa: so she's right, then? 
kimmistephens: not according to what i just said 
neenokingkompwa: but you didn't say anything otherwise 
kimmistephens: i just said you can't trust her 
neenokingkompwa: alright then 
kimmistephens: i didn't lock my dog up that day 
neenokingkompwa: so tell me what happened 
kimmistephens: i started doing that after that day because she let him get sick 
kimmistephens: i bought him a crate that cost like $100 and she would let him out every time i used it 
kimmistephens: then she got pissed and through him out with me one day and told him to chase after me 
kimmistephens: down the street in my car 
kimmistephens: she didn't tell u that did she? 
kimmistephens: i ended up taking the crate back a few days later and taking him to the spca 
kimmistephens: because of what she was doing 
kimmistephens: so don't sit there at tell me you believe the shit that comes out of her mouth, b/c i don't not anymore 
kimmistephens: not after what she did to me and more importantly, my dog 
neenokingkompwa: she wanted to keep that dog 
kimmistephens: no she didn't 
kimmistephens: that's why she threw him out 
kimmistephens: if she told you otherwise she's a liar 
neenokingkompwa: after you left her neighbors went looking for him for him 
neenokingkompwa: for her* 
kimmistephens: that's ok, i know he got a good home with people who really care 
kimmistephens: if she wanted a dog she should have said so, but it doesn't matter b/c she couldn't take care of one anyway 
kimmistephens: she was just about incapasitated when i saw her last anyway 
kimmistephens: i'm not even trying to be mean 
kimmistephens: she could barely take care of hersefl 
neenokingkompwa: she takes care of herself just fine 
kimmistephens: ok 
neenokingkompwa: so how are you and james? 
kimmistephens: that's not what i saw, but then again i was only living there 
neenokingkompwa: and why can't you two have kids 
kimmistephens: fine 
kimmistephens: thanks 
kimmistephens: who knows 
neenokingkompwa: what were you talking about when you said ""it's all the other fucking retards here that say they are my friends and then stab me in the back. "" 
kimmistephens: idk what the context was 
kimmistephens: pretty much everyone i've met here are retards 
kimmistephens: at least they just suck really bad 
neenokingkompwa: ""it seems that pregnancy changes people, for both better and worse. why is that?"" 
kimmistephens: that's a bulletin i posted 
kimmistephens: a while ago 
neenokingkompwa: right 
neenokingkompwa: but what was that all about 
kimmistephens: and it was good b/c i found out who my real friends are 
kimmistephens: and there's none of those here 
kimmistephens: actually, only a couple 
kimmistephens: it just happens that the people the suck the most are the ones that say they're pregnant 
kimmistephens: as soon as they found out, they turned into crazy bitches 
Last message received at 08/16/2007 09:27 AM 
kimmistephens: ok, so i barely ever talk to you 
kimmistephens: where did you go 
neenokingkompwa: i'm right here 
kimmistephens: but you quit talking 
neenokingkompwa: so did you 
kimmistephens: and ur taking ur grandmother's side of things when u weren't even there 
kimmistephens: i said a lot 
neenokingkompwa: i'm just ssaying i have more of a tendency to believe her 
kimmistephens: and why is that? 
neenokingkompwa: because most of the time you say things out of anger 
kimmistephens: like? 
neenokingkompwa: because i can remember soooooooo many of the times when you would go off to me about our father or grammy 
neenokingkompwa: and i would just have to sit there and let you have your say 
neenokingkompwa: most of the time i just tuned you out 
kimmistephens: ok, well that's nice 
neenokingkompwa: and even if i did say something 
neenokingkompwa: then i would get yelled at 
kimmistephens: you do know that ur mother got her pyscho tendencies from somewhere 
kimmistephens: right? 
neenokingkompwa: yeah 
kimmistephens: so like i said before, i figured ur grandmother out the hard way 
kimmistephens: she's a liar just like mom 
kimmistephens: she told you her ""version"" of the truth 
neenokingkompwa: i guess i'll never figure that out 
kimmistephens: she was pissed at me long before my dog ate chocolate 
neenokingkompwa: since she never did anything to me 
kimmistephens: and she never told me why 
kimmistephens: she clammed up the same way mom used to and then huffed about it just like mom did 
kimmistephens: you told me sooooooo many times how much you couldn't stand to go over there anymore b/c she was mean to you 
kimmistephens: too judgemental 
kimmistephens: and forceful 
neenokingkompwa: when was she mean to me? 
kimmistephens: idk 
kimmistephens: you said it 
neenokingkompwa: i don't remember ever saying that 
kimmistephens: but i guess you have the tendency to go back to people that treat you poorly 
neenokingkompwa: much less having a reason to say that 
kimmistephens: if that's what you keep doing that's all you'll ever get out of people 
neenokingkompwa: i don't go back to people that treat me poorly 
kimmistephens: you live with mom now 
neenokingkompwa: ehhh 
kimmistephens: and you still go to ur grandmother 
neenokingkompwa: not really 
neenokingkompwa: i store my things here 
neenokingkompwa: grammy never treated me poorly 
neenokingkompwa: how many times do i have to say that 
kimmistephens: and from what you told me about brad, you went back to him several times 
neenokingkompwa: no 
kimmistephens: well, i can see that you have chosen who you want to be family with and apparently i'm not on that list 
kimmistephens: and neither is dad 
kimmistephens: or john 
neenokingkompwa: i never said that 
kimmistephens: so, i guess you're better off listening to the crap your grandmother and mom feed you 
neenokingkompwa: what the hell is your problem 
kimmistephens: you just said you tend not to believe antyhing i say 
kimmistephens: b/c i'm so mean to you 
neenokingkompwa: not when your acting like this 
neenokingkompwa: tell me your not angry right now 
neenokingkompwa: you've always been mean to me 
kimmistephens: i don't have a problem except dealing with people that treat me poorly and i don't trust that 
neenokingkompwa: up until a few years ago, really 
neenokingkompwa: you've always treated me like i'm lower than you 
kimmistephens: i'm not mad just upset that you have made such a choice 
neenokingkompwa: okay 
kimmistephens: well, i'll let you think about this and go be with your new family i guess, i have to go to bed 
neenokingkompwa: it's no secret that i can't stand our father 
neenokingkompwa: but i've got no problem with john 
neenokingkompwa: or with you 
neenokingkompwa: i'm not sure where you got those ideas from 
kimmistephens: not according to what you just told me you decided 
neenokingkompwa: so i still have a relationship with grammy 
kimmistephens: you never talk to me until you hear crap from your grandmother like this 
neenokingkompwa: i never said i decided anythign! 
neenokingkompwa: no 
kimmistephens: you said you tend to believe her over me 
neenokingkompwa: we've been talking on and off for a while 
kimmistephens: that's agravating 
neenokingkompwa: without mention of her 
kimmistephens: b/c she's a liar 
neenokingkompwa: i'm sorry that there's such a time difference between us 
kimmistephens: it has nothing to do with the time difference 
kimmistephens: you never wanted to see me before 
neenokingkompwa: and that even without the time difference it's hard to catch each other in passing 
kimmistephens: ok, well i'm going to bed 
kimmistephens: good night 
neenokingkompwa: good night

I don't even feel like I should be paying the $200 a month that I do to 'live' here.&nbsp; I mean, I sleep here 3 night a week at most.&nbsp; and I don't do much more here than that. I pretty much use this place as a storage unit.....

Why don't I get a real storage unit, then? I'm sure it would be less than 200 dollars a month.&nbsp;"

"event","I've never heard of putting coffee in the fucking fridge.

Maybe it's because I'm not actually a coffee drinker, and don't personally know anyone who is.&nbsp; Aside from Matt.

Normally if he gets up before me, he'll ask if I want some hot chocolate.&nbsp; And nine times out of ten, I'll get the hot chocolate.&nbsp; 
So I decide to be the thoughtful girlfriend and, knowing he was gonna get up shortly after I left for work around 9:40ish, start his coffee before i left.&nbsp; So I paid really close attention to where everythig was the last time he made his coffee, and figured&nbsp; ""not a problem.""&nbsp; Right?

So I got up yesterday morning to get ready for work and let the pug outside, and asked Matt, who was still pretty sleepy, if he wanted me to start his coffee.&nbsp; He nodded and kissed me, and I went into the kitchen.&nbsp; I only had a problem when I went to actually put the coffee in.&nbsp; 
I looked everyewhere for it.&nbsp; EVERYWHERE. Except for, apparently, the refridgerator.&nbsp; So after I had gone in the kitchen thinking I was gonna get big girlfriend points for doing this for him and I been looking around for about ten minutes, I felt deflated as I went back into his room, kissed his cheek and said ""I would've started your coffee, but I couldn't find it.""&nbsp; 

""it's in the fridge""

.....WHAT??&nbsp; 

""to keep it fresher longer""

""But you guys go through it so freakin' fast around here, putting it in the fridge is obsolete!""

So after that I got my things together and&nbsp; was about the leave, detoured to the kitchen, again, and got the fuckin' coffee goin'.
Wow I'm and idiot.

So I went back into his room, kissed him again and told him I'd see him at work.

Lately, if i'm not at Matt's house,&nbsp; I'm at work.&nbsp; And today I'm working at 12 instead of 1.&nbsp; Til 8.&nbsp; Melissa asked if i wanted to come in early to help out more.&nbsp; Apparently Company is gonna be there.

My room is still a mess.&nbsp; 

I haven't really had that much time off work without having something planned ahead of time.&nbsp; We a had a Bloom meeting two weeks ago, and then the following week I had to go to store 391 on Shore Drive and grea Neck Road. I had to go there so that those workers could go to their own Bloom meeting.&nbsp; And then on Saturday, my mom, Matt, and I all went to Busch Gardens.&nbsp; Matt got a fun card, so as long as he's with me, he can get in without parking.

.....and all of the sudden it was time for me get ready to go to work.&nbsp; I don't think I'll be staying at Matt's tonight, so Maybe I can post more later."

"event","Neeno Kingkompwa (9:07:02 AM): hello
Stajia Was Taken (9:07:33 AM): hi, dear
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:07:46 AM): do you think i'm crazy?
Stajia Was Taken (9:08:20 AM): noooo
Stajia Was Taken (9:08:22 AM): why?
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:09:04 AM): for saying that you and brad should've gotten together
Stajia Was Taken (9:10:08 AM): ohh, no, a lot of people have asked that question, but we're just completely platonic and always have been, idk, those feeling were just not ever there
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:11:12 AM): it makes sense, though
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:11:17 AM): you two do
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:12:07 AM): you're already really good friends
Stajia Was Taken (9:12:30 AM): nah, i'm good to my friends, but when it comes to anything romantic, i'm an emotionally vapid, self-serving bitch who sneaks out before he wakes up in the morning
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:13:13 AM): he's a really light sleeper
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:13:21 AM): so you wouldn't have the chance
Stajia Was Taken (9:14:08 AM): just curious, why did all this come up?
Stajia Was Taken (9:14:21 AM): i know that you two love each other very much
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:14:25 AM): we've been fighting alot lately
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:14:56 AM): he thinks it's because of his smoking
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:15:18 AM): but it's not
Stajia Was Taken (9:15:19 AM): ya he told me he was quitting b/c you wanted him to
Stajia Was Taken (9:15:25 AM): what is it?
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:15:31 AM): well, that's a lie
Stajia Was Taken (9:15:33 AM): unless you don't feel comfortable
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:15:35 AM): because he's not quitting
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:16:23 AM): see, when he's barely making $300 in two weeks
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:16:42 AM): and then spending $100 of that on pot
Stajia Was Taken (9:17:11 AM): oh, so it's not just that it's pot
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:17:16 AM): and then probably half of what's left over on gas
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:17:30 AM): there's not much left over for saving
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:17:42 AM): and he doesn't want to open a savings account
Stajia Was Taken (9:17:44 AM): the money thing is completely understandable, and girlfriend guidance is needed in that realm
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:18:00 AM): that's the thing, though
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:18:09 AM): it's been like pulling teeth
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:18:24 AM): and do you remember when he came down here for my brother's wedding?
Stajia Was Taken (9:18:43 AM): ya
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:18:56 AM): he still hasn't paid his mom back for that
Stajia Was Taken (9:19:23 AM): wow
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:19:28 AM): i'm not sure why
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:19:29 AM): i know
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:19:36 AM): he never gave me a reason for it
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:19:54 AM): he said he doesn't want to grow up, because being an adult sucks
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:20:15 AM): and i said ""okay, peter pan, then you can be a little kid all by yourself""
Stajia Was Taken (9:21:07 AM): i know, i've seen him not grow up for years, the job and the lisence are all that's chabged since i first met him, and he was 15 then
Stajia Was Taken (9:21:32 AM): so was that it, are you guys still together
Stajia Was Taken (9:21:48 AM): was this just an argument that later got resolved
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:22:03 AM): we're together
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:22:10 AM): but i'm not sure if it's resolved
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:22:28 AM): he's just been too sick to yell at me lately, i think
Stajia Was Taken (9:23:46 AM): idk what to say, i do know exactly where you're coming from, and i wish i could help, i can try to talk tohim about it, but only if you want that, and i think he listens to you more, anyway, believe it or not
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:24:49 AM): it's like he won't listen to me until i've been crying for 15 minutes straight
Stajia Was Taken (9:26:30 AM): oh i've been there with boys, i wish there was some kind of magic word to get them to listen
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:27:29 AM): it's really frustrating
Stajia Was Taken (9:28:01 AM): i know
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:28:38 AM): and yeah, i wanted him to cut his hair
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:28:45 AM): but just to his shoulders
Stajia Was Taken (9:28:53 AM): have you tried just like, having the first thing you say to him (calmly) be "" i'm really upset over something, i need to talk about it and i'd like you to really listen""
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:28:57 AM): i never said to get it cut as short as he did
Stajia Was Taken (9:29:13 AM): that way he feel like a guilty asshole if he doesn't
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:29:15 AM): i've tried that
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:29:19 AM): and he thinks i'm kidding
Stajia Was Taken (9:29:31 AM): jeez
Stajia Was Taken (9:29:32 AM): brb
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:29:34 AM): ok
Stajia Was Taken (9:38:30 AM): well, if you wanted me to say something to him, i will, i'll just say that i talked to you and it seems like you really need his support and understanding right now
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:39:40 AM): i do
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:41:35 AM): maybe he'll listen to you since you're there
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:41:42 AM): or at least alot closer than i am
Stajia Was Taken (9:42:55 AM): i don't think that's it
Stajia Was Taken (9:43:08 AM): i just think it's strength in numbers
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:43:14 AM): maybe
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:43:18 AM): i don't know
Stajia Was Taken (9:44:07 AM): me either, but i will try for you, i was his friend first but i'm also a girl, and i do understand what you're saying to me
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:44:18 AM): okay
Stajia Was Taken (9:44:43 AM): i have to work at 10, do you know if he's working today, if he isn't i'll call him when i get out
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:44:55 AM): no he's off today
Stajia Was Taken (9:45:52 AM): ok, i'll try and kinda help relate for you, like i know you've probably said all this stuff to him, but i'll try and get back to you when i do
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:46:05 AM): okay thanks
Stajia Was Taken (9:46:16 AM): i'm glad you don't hate me though, i thought you did for awhile there
Stajia Was Taken (9:46:21 AM): it's no problem
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:46:37 AM): no i don't hate you i have no reason to
Stajia Was Taken (9:47:22 AM): well, some girls feel threatened by a female friend, i'm glad you aren't like that and that that isn't the case
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:47:36 AM): yeah
Stajia Was Taken (9:48:22 AM): ok, but i have to run to work right now, i hope i could help a little
Stajia Was Taken (9:48:28 AM): i'll talk to you soon
Neeno Kingkompwa (9:48:32 AM): alright

~I did get a kitty.&nbsp; I don't call her Tabitha much, though. Noth that it would matter.&nbsp; She's a cat, and cats are dumb.

~My boobs are pretty much healed up now, and i bought my first two new bras. I'm now a 40D.&nbsp; =)

~I have two credit cards...no trouble with those yet, though. 

~I really want to see Brad again...I've even offered to fly him down here for a few weeks...realisticaly, though, I probably won't get to see him again until October or so, when I can possibly ask for a week off to go up there....

~I'm getting a raise at work, and being promoted to full time as soon as Bernice leaves in September. 
&nbsp;I got my evaluation last week. A 94 out of 100.&nbsp; Melissa says the only thing i need to improve on is memorizing the codes and prices for everything on the floor. And that she and kristy want to have me start doing the bake in the morning! Excitment!"

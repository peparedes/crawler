"event","&nbsp;So a lot's been happening in the life of Kristin. Let's try to keep shit organized...<br /><br />Work sucks, but manageably so. Tensions are running really high between the management staff and me, but whatever, I still have a job so I guess I can't technically complain. Bills are getting a bit harder to pay and I'm pretty much living month to month, without having the financial freedom to really go out and enjoy myself....ever. But as long as when the first of the month comes around (or the 4th, heh) and I have rent, I'm still happy.<br /><br /><p>Had to break up with my boyfriend, Oz. It sucks because I really did love him, and in many ways, I still do. But I'm not at a point in my life where I can handle a relationship. I guess I got so swept up in his, well, his all-around awesomeness and thought that I could handle dating again. Cleeeeearly this was not the case and I am continuously kicking myself in the ass for letting myself get into this, and for hurting him. I should have known it was going to happen, and should have done more to prevent it, but what's done is done and I just have to try to stop looking back. If we're &quot;meant&quot; to be together, our paths will either continue to cross or cross again at a more opportune time for both of us. And no, this has nothing to do with any...*cough* &quot;ex&quot; drama, I'm 100% over that by now. I know, took me long enough right? The past is the past and I'm just trying to get back to myself. I think it took me dating Oz to realize that I -need- to be single for a while. To figure out what I want to do with my life, and get myself to a point where I can take care of myself. I don't want to be one of those girls that leaches off their boyfriends for everything. Or the type that gets too serious, too quick. And unfortunately, that's my worst tendency. So, yeah, staying single for sometime. And I'm okay with it :-)<br /><br />And now for the more...dramatic part: my family situation. As a few of you know, my sister has been going through some very rough times. She has been struggling with a trifecta from hell; bulimia, anorexia, and depression. My family has been doing the best they can to help her through this, but I'm afraid the damage is too much done. This has apparently been going on for a few years, and we are tapped financially now. There's nothing more we can do for her professionally, so it's all on us. And I'm 200 miles away. Pretty much every phone call I make to my mom checking up on things is riddled with talk about how horribly she's doing. I can't remember the last phone call I had with her that didn't end up with my poor mom crying. It sucks, and I feel completely helpless. And even more so now....<br /><br />When I went home for Thanksgiving, I told my dad that my car was in desperate need of an oil change. He normally changes it for me, so I figured it would be no big deal. Huuuuuuge mistake. Had a good few days with them and was planning on leaving the morning after Thanksgiving because I had a shift in Orlando to get back to. So I woke up that morning and looked around for my keys. Mom told me Dad had my car. &quot;Ohhhhhhhh...um....not good...&quot; My mom was trying to assure me that it'd be fine, but I was fairly certain he'd find something to yell at me about, like it being dirty, or waiting to long for the oil change. Something fucking retardedly pointless. Well I was in for a fucking shocker. Turns out, he found an empty pack of cigarettes laying in my cupholder. Not good. I told everyone else in my family that I smoke, but told them not to tell Dad because I was certain he would overreact. BINGO he flipped a shit. And decided to search my car apparently for anything else he could pin me with. And he struck gold. Or rather, green :-/ he found my pipe. Now, when I say &quot;found&quot; I mean he had to DIG for that shit. When I got home and realized it was still in my car,&nbsp;&nbsp;I put it in a glove, under layers of random things, in my center console (which has a top). So he screamed at me for about an hour until I finally just ran out of the damn house and shot back to Orlando. We haven't spoken since, but my mom and I are still on good terms, so I guess that's something. I don't really know what to do about that situation yet. I know you only one chance at a family, so I should want to fix this. But right now, I'm just ready to write him out of my life. The shit he said to me, and has already done in the past, I'm just so over it. So that shit is getting postponed...<br /><br />In other news....I MISS NOBRA. I barely ever get to see that crew anymore. Mostly because of distance, and my complete inability to spend money. It sucks, and I wanna be a bigger part of the group, but I'm pretty much stranded at my apartment, or working my ass off just trying to break even. SOOO if anyone wants to chill, drop me a line because I'm always down to hang out, and it's not like any of us can really afford to do much anyways lol.&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>&nbsp;Through a long story filled of my own stupidity, I now have a wonderful little pipe, which I've named Phoenix. She's red and white striped with a great spiral design on the bowl. Very pretty :-)</p><p>Come smoke with me!!!</p><p>Also, really am kicking myself in the butt over not getting to give that guy my number at the concert. I've never met someone without having the chance to exchange info! It sucks, can't get him off my mind. If only his name wasn't so common! I don't even know if he was from Orlando, fuck my life haha&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>It was AMAZING. I forgot how much I loved big concerts like that. I had a huge blast, get ready for story time, pop some corn.</p><p>Worked an early out shift in the AM, and naturally they kept me as long as fucking possible because they could sense that I had better shit to do lol. So once I&nbsp;was out, I texted Nicole (concert buddy :) ) &nbsp;and told her that I'd be there soon. I hadn't gotten a ticket yet cuz I was too short on online funds to buy one. So I was crossing my fingers all day that they wouldn't sell out. So I&nbsp;stuffed my wallet with (what I thought was going to be) beer money and jetted over to Tinker field. Got there around 5. Parking was $10 and the damn ticket was $63...fuck that shit no drinking for me!</p><p>Met up with Nicole in the stands because Cold was playing and really, who cares? We did enjoy Candlebox, even if like 3/5ths of their set was covers lol. The last 3 bands to play were Static-X, Chevelle and then 311 to close it off. We were stoked for all three so we went into the pit starting at Static-X. It was amazing! Damn I didn't realize that I loved moshing that much. I love the thrill of being in that crown. I love being crushed between so many other fans, all of us just rocking out to the music we love. The energy of the crowd was amazing, There were like thousands of people there, fucking love it. So I got shoved into a pit (that I wasn't ready for) during Bled for Days (Fucking yessssss) and actually got thrown down and got a cut on my leg. That's right bitches, I bled for Static-X during Bled for Days. Hah I love it. So that was awesome.<br /><br />Now here's where my night gets fan-fucking-tastic. We went to the bathroom while Chevelle set up, so when we came back, we were on the opposite side of the stage and much closer. Met up with my Applebuddy Tonya and a girl I had met the previous night. We were like 10 feet from the stage, so great! Chevelle put on an awesome set. And then came sexy awesome metal boy (whose name turned out to be Chris, but I like that description better) who came up behind me randomly and pretty much stayed there the whole show. Out of all the skanky ass guys rubbing up and touching me all night, definitely didn't mind this one haha. After Chavelle finished he moved over a bit and met up with his friends I guess, smoking joints and shit as 311 set up. They wheeled out so many more speakers, I got very excited lol. But my &quot;concert buddy&quot; Nicole and her friend were complaining that their feet hurt. Fuck that! I told them to go ahead back to the stands cuz I didn't wanna move. So I made new friends. And Chris gravitated back towards me which made 311 that much more amazing. <br /><br />If you haven't seen 311 live, I highly suggest that you do. I didn't consider myself a huge fan, but last night certainly changed that. Their drummer is AMAZING. And they put on an incredible show. I was rocking out the whole time, dancin' up on Chris, passing joints around, fuckin people up in the pit with him and his friends. I love being a tall bitch who can handle herself. They were trying to run protection from me I guess but I didn't really need it. So eventually it was time for 311 to stop playing, and we were all bummed. I asked him if we'd get an encore (none of the other bands did one so I didn't know what to expect) then the crowd stated chanting and I figured we would. He had his hands on my hips still, and before the encore he spun me around and started kissing me until they came back on stage, awesome! I miss making out lol, freaking month and a half of nothing. So that was fucking awesome. They started playing, we rocked out some more. Then the damn crowd pulled us apart at the end! So all I know of sexy awesome metal boy is that his name is Chris, the most common boy name ever lol. <br /><br />Why must God hate me!!!!<br /><br />But yeah, kick ass show. I have two bruised and swollen ankles, a cut on my leg, had a puffy eye and lip from being kicked in the face a few times by crowd surfers, my neck is killing me, and my back is throbbing in pain. And it was totally fucking worth it. When's the next show! I fucking love that shit. &nbsp;</p>"

"event","I just worked back to back doubles totaling 24 hours within 2 days...ah. Today, my night shift started rocky. This table of ghetto ass white boys came in and I ended up taking them, first table. Got them their drinks, and the next thing I&nbsp;know, one of them had gone up to my manager and told him that I was rude and condescending. They requested a new server! How dumb I really can't think of what I would have done/said to make them feel that way, but whatever. Maybe my grasp on the English language was too much for their ebonic asses. Screw 'em

So the night progressed well, just slow and boring, But my last table of the night was an 11 top, two hispanic family. They were very nice, I took pretty good care of them seeing as they were my only table at the time. But once I&nbsp;got them cashed out, one of the dads asked for my full name so that he could e-mail corporate about what a wonderful job I did.

So I started the night with a guest complaint, and ended with a super awesome compliment? Weird, but cool I guess :-)&nbsp;"

"event","So I went up to a table today, nice country folks. We talked for a sec, got the guy's order. Then he randomly asks me if I know Carson Griffin. &quot;Oh I miss him so much!&quot; Well apparently this guy was his army recruiter! How freaking random is that, that he came to my table. He said that he wanted to get Carson's address and bring it to the store for us. Seriously we gotta write him. I&nbsp;know he's not really taking the away time well, and it's not just Gina that he misses. 

So, when/if I get his address (he already has mine) I'll let everyone know so that we can flood his mailbox with happiness!

Rally up friends, Carson needs some lovin :-)&nbsp;"

"event","<p>&nbsp;So many stupid things have happened recently and I'm tracing them back to two key suck parts of my dumb life right now. Yes I&nbsp;know I actually have a great life, but I'm acting dumb lately.&nbsp;</p><p>1) I really miss Carson! I mean, we didn't start actually being friends until very recently, but he was there for me through some key times and just the thought that the only communication I can have with him for the next twoooooooo whole years will be via snail mail? Suuuuck. It sucks like just getting to know someone, and then they leave. Bleh</p><p>2) My sister attempted again, and my Mom wants to put her in a hospital over the summer and maybe even for her next year of high school. That's just something that I have noooo idea how to handle, and there's like no one I&nbsp;can turn to for help in that situation.&nbsp;</p><p>So, two sucky things are effecting my mood to the point where I lose my shit over something as small as someone telling me that I don't know about Halo...which was probably true at the time. Ugh I wish I could undo things!&nbsp;</p><p>But it's cool, because this class will be over in 15 minutes, and I'll be able to go home, pop some corn and watch new episodes of Top Model and Scrubs. Exciting, I know.</p><p>Can't wait to see what I do next....</p>"

"event","So I've beaten Metallica on Medium guitar, next up will be Hard bass. But I recently learned that I can use the XBox headset as a microphone and THAT is exciting :-). More achievements, hooray! So I'll be doing that all day. Gonna be planning Carson's party a bit too, so let me know if anyone wants to help! I gotta organize my whole damn garage by myself, maybe with Lee's help (crosses fingers). 

That whole situation is really angering. My garage currently has 4 couches, 3 mattresses, and countless other small things. And like 80% of it is Greg's, my roommate's boyfriend. Sooo I'm going to be organizing HIS shit, because he won't fuckin' do it himself. Ugh. But I'd like to get it back to somewhat of a hang out spot for when the party happens. 

Who's excited. Woo.&nbsp;"

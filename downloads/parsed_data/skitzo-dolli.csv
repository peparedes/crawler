Today was the third time I went but it's so not as horrible as Carousel. I keep messing up codes and crap but hopefully that'll be embedded in my brain soon.

I'm dying my hair as soon as I get the cash and getting a bit of a trim.

I'm finally getting a little bit happier now :)"

"event","I'm currently eating a yogo. Chocolate flavour. It's not very nice.

I'm making these pants right and they're almost finished but silly shit keeps happening. And NOW the wasitband has decided to be too short so I have to alter it. *Sigh* Annoying.
I'm using my mum's sewing machine in prefrence to the shitty one the junkie left at my house. It's a lot quieter I have found out!

*sigh* Bored..... Yesterday was my Granddads Birthday and today is Jenniekins birthday.

I do my training on Monday 9 am til 12 pm so that should be good. I think I get paid for it so I will hopefully be getting enough to go get a PS2 or something. 

Anyways I better go finish my pants."

"event","<p>Last night I saw Marilyn Manson LIVE!<br /><br />It's was so awesome. My sister dropped my brother-in-law and I off at about 8-ish and then we went straight in and he bought a bottle of water and we went to go in to get our seats and they wouldn't let us in with a bottle! Because of that other thing that happened. Anyways after we got in we found out we had awesome seats, not too close, but not too far from the stage. <br />The opening band was the Spazzy's. They are shit. Like good on them for getting such a big gig but they were fucking irritating and rude to the audience. Eventually their time was up and then it we waited for about half an hour for Mansons stuff to get set up. They dropped down this big curtain with the MM thing but in the Eat me, Drink me style writing which looked kool.<br />Then they turned the lights off and they turned on a red spot-light from behind the stage through the curtain and it showed the band members getting into position and then Manson stood directly infront of it. Was really kool but my picture of it didn't show up.<br />He played a number of songs and then before one (For some reason I don't remember which!) he said something like ""I'd like to share something with you Perth. I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY SCHOOL SHOOTING!"" The crowd went nuts for that.<br />He kept throwing his microphone stand onto the floor, and there was this kid who's job was to just run on and off stage making sure the stand was up. After a while I think Manson started to mess around with the kid and every like few second he passed it he'd push it down. Funny shit.<br />When Manson went to play ""The Fight song"" they set up the front of the stage with the red rope things they get from cinemas and made a tiny little Boxing ring corner for him and he had one of those boxer robes and was punching the air and shit. Was hilarious.<br /><br />Only members of Marilyn Manson that I knew were Manson himself and Tim Skold and Ginger Fish. Oh yeah and when they first came out some skank too her top off. It was so cliche it was funny.<br /><br />All in all the Manson concert was awesome and so worth the money! I'm so&nbsp; glad I can finally say I've seen Marilyn Manson live!<br /><u><font color=""#0000ff""><br /></font></u><br />On another note I have a job now. It's fucking good finally to be distracted.</p>"

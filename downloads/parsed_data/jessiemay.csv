"event","so, my cat is officially trying to murder me. yes its sad but true. he latched on to my arm and wouldn't get off, i tried prying him off, but it didn't work. I had to call calen in to get him off of me, and in that amount of time i literally have a good 30 scratches on my arm. not just whimpy ones either, people are starting to ask questions. lol.
i really should enlist in some type of cat behavioralist or something. 
in other news, i am currently broke as all hell, what's new though. but this time i am REALLY broke, not just like oh, i don't have any extra money. flat out broke. Don't think me and calen are going to even try to find new roomates at this point. We are just going to live on our own...we like it that way anyways. Plus, i don't really currently know anyone that wants to move out or anything, and the only ones that do i don't particularly want as roomates. 
I kinda want to move, but i move, i really want to just get out of florida. I would LOVE to move to tennessee, but I have to wait for my scholarship to run out first. 
I definitly think I am going to go for a ANRP(nurse practitioner), although i might as well just attempt to be a doctor at that point. We'll just have to see what happens.

I do really want to go on vacation though..... but, there's that whole obstacle of being broke.  hmm.
I also would really like to eat some lasagna right about now, but its a little late to start cooking....... sooo hungry though.
alright...done rambling now."

"event","hmm...been a while since i needed to vent a little...so here goes.
well, first off...My dad moved all of his stuff outta denise's apartment which is AWESOME...but, he won't actually break up with her because she is a manipulative psycho bitch and keeps making him feel guilty about stupid shit. Its really pissing me off because he continuously complains about how much of a pain in the ass she is 90% of the time, but he won't get enough balls to do anything about it. Last night we sat down and he made a list of the pro's and con's of denise (he can't seem to remember all of them, so i recommended that he write them down) 
The pro's list consist of 8 things, most of which you could recieve from a pet dog, aka, companionship ect. And my favorite, she will make him food occasionally. The con's list went on to #60...and then he had to go. We weren't even done with the damn thing.
 WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH HIS HEAD.
I swear that he is being brainwashed. I am like 2 days away from just giving up. I should have done so a long time ago, but i prefer to keep my father. Tonight he is having yet another discussion with her, and Marvin(his friend) is joining them. He supposedly is on my dad's side, but he is such a gossip queen, that could easily change in the presence of Denise. 

Ok...sorry bout the drama fest.

On another note, I think I am really going to try this phamacist thing, but I am going to have to learn how to do math first. The school is a little scary looking, but I think if I put my mind to it I could do it.
Calen  worked a double today....i have been sitting around the house bored outta my mind. Although it is nice to sit around and not do anything once and a while. Yea yea, i know i am usually a lazy person anyway..but still, i've been working alot lately.I worked about 50 hours last week, and in such a hectic place like that, it'll take a lot out of a person.

Well,guess i should make some food. Chili sounds good."

"event","hmm...sooooo calen can't seem to go a whole 4 hours with out smoking...that's wonderful. I need to do the dishes...hmm...did like 5 loads of laundry and it still isn't done. If the piles of clothes stay at bey for at least a few days I would be amazed, calen's favorite phrase is "" oh, i'm wearing that tommorrow, so i won't put it away"" and then there isn't a clean space in the room. wish i had a walk in closet...that would help. I also wish that the sponges wouldn't magically disapear. I bought a pack of four,  and now i don't have any...except for the one i found under the sink, which was ran through the dish washer because i am not sure what it was used for in the past. I think i am going to take a semester off after this one so that i can train for a job that might actually pay more than minimum wage. Shooting for the pharmacy tech thing still, they called me today again...i have to go up there for an interveiw. I need to vaccuum in here...don't know when the last time that was done, prolly when i did it last, considering my vaccuum sucks ass it won't help much. I need some curtains out here....tried to use a sheet  and get all ghetto, but the cat can't seem to allow that to happen, so guess i will have to wait until i have enough money to buy some. I hope my father realizes that i am taking all that with me.
So I guess if/when miranda leaves I technically will have to take a semester off b/c my father seems to think that i will be able to cover everything making 6.50 an hour. yea right. not doin to hot right now as it is. I will mostly likely have to work days at the pharmacy (praying that i get that) and then nights as a server...cause i don't think calen is going to be making much more money either, plus i feel like I am the one who wanted to do this, so i should pick up the weight. I can't find anyone who wants to either move out of their parents house or is planning to leave where they are living now...anyone who does owns dogs and such, which my dad won't allow...in which case i feel like saying, well i have someone to cover it and you won't let them so you are going to have to help me...but he is off doing his own shit with denise, so that doesn't seem to be registering with him. My only really option is doug and dannielle, whom i don't trust, and if miranda leaves in December, which she seems to be planning on, they can't move in anyway b/c they have a lease until like May '06. 
arg....well...my bitch fest is over...getting kinda sleepy...kinda wish there was something to do though, ah, but nothing...."

"event","I am bored...
Calen is working a double today. I have today off.
Miranda is at work...most everyone else is at school.
I'm starting to get a little un-nerved by the fact that Calen doesn't want to do anything but work and hang out with Doug. I don't like the fact that doug is up to some pretty shady dealings and yet Calen is still overthere EVERY day. He keeps saying "" I don't like what is going on over there, so I don't think I am going to hang out over there that much""...and then only hours later, doug calls and calen leaves. I guess my point is that, if he wants to hang out with his friends that's fine, I just wish he had some friends that weren't into doing certain things. I guess a part of me just doesn't trust his friends, and that partly makes me not trust him sometimes.
I dunno. I mean, if he wasn't doing something that I ""disapproved"" of, then he wouldn't just go straight overthere when he got off of work, knowing I am sitting at home waiting to go eat.He almost sneaks around sometimes.
I really really do love him, but I just feel like he is keeping things from me sometimes, obviously because he thinks I am going to get mad at him.
And knowing that makes me want to just stop caring about what he is getting into and do my own thing. I'm not saying I want to leave or anything at all... I just think I will start giving him his space, and if he wants to get involved with that shit, then I just don't have to worry about what I don't know. (I guess I will just stick with what I don't know won't hurt me)
But then I am just afraid that something will happen between us.
Its not like we get to see eachother outside of school, sleeping, and the occasional meal together all that much. I feel like if I stopped trying to do go out and do stuff with him, he would just take all of his free time to do whatever, and maybe once a week he would decide to do something with me. If I stop trying, I think he would just do his own thing anyway. But , I guess the only way to know is to just see what happens.
This much sound like a bunch of jibberish if anyone is actually reading it. lol.
oh well, if you do read it and understand it...feel free to give advice.

I guess every relationship does this...you're completely full of eachother, and then someone starts pulling away a little. It really doesn't mean the realationship is falling apart or anything, it just means you don't feel like you have to try to spend every second that your not at work or school with eachother. But to me, there is so little of that time anyway...  I dunno. I guess if I had more to do myself it wouldn't be such a big deal. I don't like going to ybor... too many people and the only night that I can actually go out and don't have to be up at 7 am is Sunday...in which case no one is doing anything. I guess I should try not to ""blow people off"" so much...but I am a homebody because of the fact that I only get time to myself like 5% of the time in a week. I work almost 40 hours a week and then take 3 classes. If I actually studied(which I have yet to do) I would have like 2 hours a week, that I wasn't sleeping,to actually do something. 
this sucks.
I have to stop second guessing things so much and just go with the flow.
okay..my ramble fest is over...guess I will attempt to study today...since there is nothing else to do.

Adios"

"event","Well damn, I just can't seem to write in this thing on a consistant basis.
oh well...
I have been thinking alot lately about the past few years of my life...
How things might have turned out different if I would have stayed in one place at any given time. If I haden't listened to the drama so much and been so gullable, I might still have some of my long lost friends that were truely worth keeping. Its just so hard in high school to discern against the crazy people and the decent people, ecspecially at countryside. I regret letting a lot of things get to me so much, and not standing up for my real friends.
I wish Melanie would have NEVER have entered my life, because honestly the reason I don't have some of my most trust worthy friendships(at least I think) is because of her backstabbing/pathlogical liar ass. I would probably still be friends with Megan P. and Jenna, and who knows what different path I would have went down if melanie hadn't drug my through so much shit. Still wish my dad would break up with that dumb bitch.
I don't miss some of the high school drama, of course...but it was high school, and what else do you have to do but be entertained with other people's drama?
Although, if I would have stayed in clearwater I would have had to live with my disoriented mother, and probably would have never met Calen.

I guess you can't worry about the past too much, it will drive you nuts.
All you can do is hope that things turn out good in the end, and that maybe you can fix your mistakes...

ahh. I miss dashboard.....  : -(    I think i will listen to it for a bit tonight...

Me and Calen drove up here on Sunday. I wonder what my dad is going to be doing. My mom, great grandma, my uncle and cousins are coming tommorow... don't know where we are all going to sleep.
It's our one year anniversary on sunday. That's pretty cool. It doesn't feel like it's been a year. We got in a fight on the way up here though, kinda. well, i don't know,we don't really fight. It's weird. Probably because i hate fighting. I can't stand it. I've been a real ""homebody"" lately and i know it pisses everyone off. Calen wants me to hang out with his friends, and my friends want me to hang out with them. It's weird though, this is the first time in my life for a very long time that things have been stable, and i kinda just want to take some time to sit back and enjoy it. I like just sitting at home watching tv or reading a book. I like having nothing to do except homework. It's not that i don't want to have fun, its just that i want to get everything else grounded first. I've been sorting out relationships and chaos for a while, and i feel like i am almost happy with my relationships in my family. So that makes me so much more relieved. This trip kinda makes me feel like i can re-connect with my family. Its hard to balance everything, but i am working on it. Like i said, i've never had stable life, so i am ajusting it accordingly. 
I missed my doggies and kitties. I want to take them with me!

I've been really stressed out lately and I am so ready to be done with school. I love how on my progress report I have 2 B's and a C, even though I never come. That just shows how retarded all my classes are. English could use a little help, but our 600 point research paper will pretty much be my grade anyways. So that's probably going to be another C.
People act like I am unaware of what I am doing. I think I have it under control. I am more worried about my mom having liver cancer right now than anything else, and as long as I find a way to keep all my grades above a D,(which I am, and plan on keeping them that way) I could really care less. At work they put more and more shit on me everyday, and my family seems to be doing the same.
So I guess that's all i really have to say . . . and I know everyone thinks I am fucking everything up. But I guess what I am saying is, I know what I am doing, so let it go. Please.

really...swear it. I am hungry...I am tired. I have been studying for, hummm 3-4 hours...and have accomplished nothing. I have to read 2 books by friday, and barnes and noble has NONE of the books on my list. At least my articles are done. 
Oh, and I have a huge test, that will pretty much determine my grade...and then exams....tear tear.
Oh, and some how, i have to do something with my mom, my grandmother and grandfather, start work/go to training, study for exams, and by some miracle the teachers have all decided they need to cram just one more test down our throats before exams. YAY. I can hardly contain myself.
Well, this is sapping up my PRECIOUS time, so gotta get on that one.

How fun, you'll never know.

Painted the WHOLE house in 2 days.

Car died for the 18th time.

Rearranged entire bedrooms.

Peeled Wallpaper.

Went to walmart, lowes, homedepot, and publix no less than 20 times.

Had no contact with any of my friends because, oh yea...racked up a 200 dollar bill...

Hope you all had a grand time.

That's pretty much it. Everything is going nuts....really. My mother is just confusing me. My grandmother hates me...
Everything at my  dad's house is just pure insanity. Shove 5 people into a 2 bedroom house and there you go, you have a new MTV hit show on tuesday nights at 10. And then throw in all the legal problems ect, and you have me wanting somewhere else to live.  But I am solely responsible for getting some ish done, and I can't leave. I can't seem to get anything to go right or even remotely the way I want it to. By October 1st, I am supposed to have a job. So that I can pay for my expenses. But remember, things were supposed to be easier...we were supposed to have more money. Not really working out that way. I don't even have 1 dollar to my name, and I can't even put enough gas in my car to get to clearwater. Ask me how I plan on making it to school tomarow... because i really don't know. My dad has made me feel so guilty ever time I ask for any money, I don't even try anymore. what's the point?? 
I am not really up for anything anymore, and I don't know why....things are just tooo different now... and there is so much stuff I have to get done....that I just don't want to do at all. I don't know.....just venting a little.......

Definitly got my ass fried at the beach yesterday. Don't really feel up to moving at all right now. 
I hope we do some more crazzy mission impossible moves this weekend. But i can't see it happening for some reason. I have to make some muffins. I don't have a muffin pan. Screw this crap.

I am not in such a bad mood today. 
Just kinda stopped thinking about everything for just a bit. 
**Hopefully that feeling sticks around for a while**
Ran into an old friend today. Makes me really think. I realized that I knew her before my parents got divorced. That's caaaarrazzay.
She's really cool though. I wonder what she's been up to for the past like 3 years. Its kinda weird to think about knowing someone for so long, losing touch forever, and then just all the sudden talking again. 
Ah, who knew.
I am really thristy. Just a random thought.
I really do enjoy being back at chs. I know that no one else really gets it, but after being shuffled around so much, it really feels good to, for once, go back to a school that I actually know.I miss all the people that I didn't get to talk to and see that much. Its pretty cool to be back.
Even if we are turning into a ghetto school, and the crew isn't around anymore, and even if the damn freshmen think they're some kinda hot shit. But that's cool.

Saw all kinds of people that I haven't seen in ages. It was pretty cool.
I have just been wandering around in a daze all day. I have no clue what the hell is going on. I don't have anywhere to live, I don't have my car..my grandpa is pissed at me because I messed it up by not telepathically knowing that you have to get the oil changed once evey like few months. So now I am going to hear that for the next seven hundred years. YAY.
This whole no lunch shit is going to kill me. I love leaving at 1:19, but they need to at least give us a 15 minute break up in there. This is just insane. My eating schedual is all outta wack now. Screw this. I am going to become an anorexic and blame it on the school.
Bastards!
Called some of my friends from Tarpon today, They had 400 kids at their school that weren't supposed to be there. Sucks.
umm,not to sure what's going on with the dad and gf, last i have been updated, Denise is barganing with the ex-husband in order for Melanie to stay up there. Whatever makes them happy.
I just wonder what is going to happen in the world of my dad in the coming months.

Cut the hair. Looks pretty good. I opted out of hacking it to peices, and I just took a little off the length and got it super star style layered. Its interesting. Everyone who has seen it likes it soo far. I hope it works for me. I love susie. 
Me and Melanie and Laurin went to la playa yesterday, definitly thought that I got fried, but its not as bad as I thought.Then we went out and had dinner, because Melanie tells me that she isn't going to come back to Florida for the rest of the summer. This makes me sad. She wants me to come visit her in SC, but I have to find someone to come with me. DO you  wanna come??
fun stuff kids, 
these animals I have to take care of are killing me. I can't remember half the crud I have to do, and then I leave them all day and arg. I have to just sit there and give them attention the rest of the week because I left them all weekend. I have no gas in my car, and I don't get paid untill friday. Amanda and Jenna want me to come party like a rock star, but, I don't have any money for gas or food or any of that stuff,and then I have to wake up at 8 o'clock if I stay up there to go to work,and I can't be partying untill all hours of the night like the cool kids do. 
I gotta job darn it. And I have to take care of 4 cats, 2 dogs, and Birdies for the rest of the week. So take a chill pill kids, I will make my way back into the party scene, when my ""responsibilities"" are cut in half, and my grandma stops being crazy, and Melanie and Laurin go home (which is either today or tommorow, I think).

My dad is going looney. miss Denise has to go to court about the whole her cousin wrote bad checks and signed denise's name to it crapola. He can't think about anything else. I feel bad, I want to be there for him. 
I haven't seen my mother in weeeeks. Like forever and ever. I miss her. She hates me. Like she really really hates me. no kidding kids. She wants me to go jump off a bridge. She won't talk to me, she's gone p-sycho. I have done nothing to her. I haven't even been there. I don't know what to do. When i go there, I end up leaving as fast as possible and calling amanda in absolute hysterics while driving over the bayside bridge in the pooring rain. I don't know what to do about anything in my life right now. I went to new orleans. Had a great time, but i knew that everything that i left here would just snow ball when i came back. And man did it. I have an Avalanche now. I am so lost and confused. I feel like I can't do the things I want to do. Amanda and Jenna probably think I hate them. I don't. I love them. But I can't be in 70 places at once. I feel so horrible because everyone expects so much out of me. And I can't say no to anyone, so I end up juggling seven million things at once. I don't know what to do anymore. Jenna got in a big accident and  I wasn't there. Amanda broke up with terry and aparently is having a hard time dealing with it and I am not there. I want to be there. I am soorrrry. 
I feel so crappy, and i find my self crying for no apparent reason because i just don't know how to deal with it all. 
I am taking my senior pictures on thursday next week. 
I don't wanna be a senior.
Damn it.
Does anyone know what the names of the books we have to read for honors are??
I wish countryside high school would pretend that i was a  student and would send me that stupid information that everyone else is getting. damn it.
arg.

                Counting the days that past me by

            I've been searching deep down in my soul
         Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
             Looks like I'm starting all over again
         The last three years were just pretend and I say

                          Goodbye to you
             Goodbye to everything I thought I knew

but, other wise its all good.
Guys suck more than words can ever describe. I am giving up all hope. I may decide to join the opinion of fuck them over before they fuck you over. My new game plan, but , we all know that I am way to nice, and I let people walk all over me way to much, so that plan will never work out for me. Guess I will just have to build a tolerence to being screwed over. I am almost there.

Man, school is like raping me of a life. F c u  k school. they need to make that a shirt. ha.
All my teachers have decided that we are slacking too much, and I have seniors in almost all my classes, and they have some huge plan to combat senioritis. Damn them all. I have a report to do for every damn class, Labs out the ears, chem homework like crazy , but thats just cause my teacher is a p- sycho.... ahh, but in espanol we are so watching ""a neverending story"" in spanish...ha, and I thought E.T. was scary in spanish, can't wait to see this one. ahhh.

Everyone hates me now. Why?

I think that I should move back to saint pete or something. I feel outta place now. No one seems to be acting the same around me , and I don't know why or what to do about it. 
If you have any ideas, feel free to share them with me.
God knows, this is probably just one of those lovely mood swings that i go through..."

"event","I feel like I've been to a lot of events lately. Starting with the ICOTY Awards in January, I've kept myself busy by attending all of these great events/formal parties around MSU. Also, lately when I go somewhere lately and find myself dancing, I'm being photographed.

For Valentine's Day, I went to the ISA Ball. Shereen went with her boyfriend and I went with Sarah. Haha. There was a photographer there taking pictures and since Shereen, Jon, and I were the only ones dancing, the photographer took lots of pictures of us, and that is how I got the lovely facebook picture that I have now! :)

On Tuesday, Shereen and I went to Mac's to dance like we usually do, and also kind of check out this dude who'd been scoping me and I him. The guy turned out to be a fuddy-duddy (just another dude I made out with at a club...ugh, sounds so bad) but the dancing was freaking amazing, and there happened to be another photographer taking shit tons of pictures of us.

Thursday, I went to ACS's annual hafla (Arabic dance party) where I found myself dancing my ass off...again. I learned dabke (which is like a traditional arab line dance) and got to freestyle dance also. No professional photographers at the event, but Shereen, Sarah, and Madhath sure took a shit ton for themselves.

I guess I will always be a dancing woman."

"event","Was today gorgeous or what? People went a little nuts around here, wearing tee shirts and short shorts and flip flops and what not, but still, it was ab fab.

This morning, I had a yummy-nummy breakfast of scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, and the best biscuits and honey ever, with some crazy fruit. The fruit was SO TASTY. It tasted just like what fresh cut pineapple, strawberries, and melon should taste like. Just so rich in flavor for things that aren't even in season. How do they do it?!

So I left to go to class and the weather is gorge. I had to stop and smell the fucking air. It just smelled like water and mud and grass and I seriously wanted to flop down and roll in the muddiness, but I figured I should go to PoliSci.

After that I went running, my iPod ran ou of batteries, but that was a-okay! Shereen and I got our confirmation that we have our super exclusive on-campus apartment next year! Van Hoosen is so fucking hard to get into for some reason. You have to apply butt-shit early (we applied the week after Labor Day and still were in danger of not getting a room) and have to have good grades. THE HELL! But after we received the e-mail that we have our apartment, we went to the housing office to secure it. We will be living in 208. Corner, lots of room, faces the woods, only one neighbor, kick ass deal.

We decided to celebrate by taking a stroll along Grand River. I squealed in delight a lot. Then we met with the Seb-ster, who has a gorgeous haircut, and we all went for din-din and met up with Sebba's former boytoy-thing-type-person Levi. Levi's a creep. First he tried to get with Shereen, but that didn't work. Then he tried getting with me, and that didn't work. And he went through the whole group until he got to Sebba, who gave in. Now she's chasing better looking dudes now that she took off the hijab. Levi was into the whole hijab thing, thought it made Sebba ""mysteriously sexy"" which kind of defeats the purpose of it. Levi, ah, what a horndog.

I capped the evening off by going to a documentary shown on campus which I detail <a href=http://zevolution.wordpress.com>here</a>. Just in case you didn't know, I've been cheating on this blog with another one. :)"

Last year, I gave up [or attempted to give up] sex for Lent. We all know a certain trip to Baltimore kind of fucked that one up (no pun intended). So, instead, I've decided to do something much easier.

I'm not going to straighten my hair! 

So, it's not that big of a deal like you know, like fasting (like my mom does/used to do), or even giving up pleasures of the flesh, but it's something that I do and sometimes I wonder, WHY THE HECK AM I DOING IT? It's like a weird force of habit. I've already got a bit of a head start on it because I stopped straightening it last month, so I guess my goal for lent is to CONTINUE not straightening my hair. That's fair game, right Jesus?

Also, has anyone else noticed that there are always a few days in February where the weather gets like 40-50 degrees?! I've noticed this since I was like 9 or 10 living in Ohio, but the general weather pattern for NE Ohio is pretty much the same here (except we got a LOT more snow due to stupid Lake Erie)."

"event","So, Ls & Gs:

I'm going to Guatemala over Spring Break! :D

MSU is offering a trip to Guatemala over Spring Break, where you volunteer in a small town. We'll be working in a coffee factory, cutting and making bamboo items with local artisans, teaching children, working on an eco-friendly hotel, playing soccer with the kids, things like that. We have a day where we learn traditional Guatemalan cooking methods (YES). Then we go to Lake Atitlan, Volcan Pacaya and visit some Mayan ruins (I'm not sure if it's Tikal or not).

We're staying in Antigua, a former Spanish colonial town which seems pretty much amazing. 

I am so fucking psyched about this.

I really am really glad about the opportunities Michigan State has given me. Honestly, I don't know how much of this I would've gotten at Western. On top of my depression and the people in general kind of being annoyingly two-dimensional, Western didn't offer that great of opportunities for me as a student or journalist. The Western Herald wasn't respected by most students, had shitty writing (AP errors on the FRONT PAGE), and had nerve to be elitist on top of all of that. I'd heard of volunteer abroad things through Dr. Chad, but they were always through bigger schools like MSU. Like Anuj said to me last night, ""Western is pretty much the Michigan school for dummies. You so didn't belong there.""

MSU has given me so much; I'm thrilled to be going to college at this big, gorgeous amazing school, working at an online magazine, and now-- going to Guatemala.

"event","The International Car of the Year Awards show was last night and it was amazing. Like, crazy. I started off SUPER stressed out because I thought I'd bought a boring dress and my hair wasn't curling and my makeup wasn't agreeing with me, and due to the whole snowstorm, I couldn't go out and buy new, colorful shoes or a purse or anything. So I wore black on top of black on top of black. (Ana Banana in Ann Arbor is closed for good, btw. :( )

After I'm done, my mother insists that she wants to take pictures of me and chases me around with my camera and I'm FULLY annoyed. I hate taking pictures just because I'm dressed up. I hated the idea of Prom or Homecoming pictures, because my mother acts like such a FUCKING dork and goes on and on about how BEAAAUUU-TI-FUL I am. It really gets on my fucking nerves. EUGH.

I'm about to leave into the huge snowstorm when my dad thinks he needs to be his two-cents in and is costing me time because he's so fucking long-winded. He ended up driving me and I got there LATE.

So, I started checking people in. Ken Cockrell (interim Mayor of Detroit) IS A HUUUUUGE ASSHOLE. He walks in late, ignores the check-in, and threatens to leave if Courtney didn't announce his presence at the show. Turns out, Courtney already had but he was SO LATE that he missed it. Courtney announced him anyway, and the dickhead left anyway. WHAT A SHIT.

But the rest of the show was amazing, and I have never been hit on by so many old men. Actually, the young assistant to the Attourney General tried to hit on me and Sam, but he wasn't cute at all. But I kept getting winked at and spouting of, ""you're gorgeous"" and ""oh wow"" and one middle aged guy trying hard for my attention by staring at me and walking in my line of sight. Hahaha.

At the afterparty, I munched on yummy papaya (like dear Michelle), dates, brie with honey, marinated mozzerella blobs. Then Dan Weise of the St. Louis Dispatch got on the piano and played Bohemian Rhapsody. I run over and sing along. He starts playing more songs, I keep singing. I sang all night. It was amazing. Afterward, Sam, Jessica (who used to work for RTM), Trever and I chatted for an hour before I headed back to my gorgeous room.

The atmosphere was gorgeous and sexy and amazing. I felt great. Though my dress was black and strapless it fit me perfectly. Because I felt so great and comfortable, I ended up telling jokes and being charming. :)

This was so great, and a perfect way to kick off my year!"

But today was fun. I realized I was PMSing and had a weird day. Spent the afternoon drinking tea with Shereen and making kandy for our electric dance party/rave thingy that we went to at Mac's.

When we got there, NO one was dancing. Not a soul. Shereen and I being the fearless women we were, went out there and got our groove on. Sarah, not wanting to be a spoil sport, got out there and danced too. She's a good dancer, but worries that she looks silly. People were pretty much watching us the whole time. As they became more drunk, more and more started to dance. There was a guy with some weird glowing subwoofer shirt, and a relentless guy who bared a creepy resemblance to Kobe Bryant, but shorter. The last DJ was by far the best. Ugh, it was amazing. I think Sarah's going to want to go back every Tuesday night.

It was just so lovely to see that so many people were so happy for someone to be elected? Has that ever happened before?

Think about it.

It's absolutely amazing. We have a president that we are proud of and we can love after eight years of embarrassment. The whole country wants Obama, he turned red states blue for Christ's sake! I'm so glad that our country has chosen someone that we love enough to pull a landslide victory for. Obama was a great choice. He's young and fresh on a platform that will benefit most of America and is articulate enough to speak to Americans and foreigners well. Good job, America!

Did you notice how amazing the weather was for Election Day? It's supposed to snow on Saturday (at least here) but the sun seriously came up and warmed us up to 70+ degrees, which is UNHEARD of for Michigan. I would say divine intervention, but...maybe that's pushing it. Hahaha.

I'm just so incredibly happy. Here's a photo of Shereen, Sarah and I from the MSU explosion at East Complex:

"event","Shereen told me that she wanted us to go to a party with Jon Waller (the good-looking hookah guy from WAY in the beginning of the year), Grant, his elfin-looking loveable tool-ish friend, and Chad and Aaron (quite the stoner twosome). No problem! But not even an hour before we leave, she finds out that it a costume party, as it is an early Halloween party.

I hadn't finished putting together all of the pieces of my Storm costume together, but I figured I had enough. I had the white wig, shiny, leather-esque pants, close fitting black shirt, my biker-looking fake leather jacket. Problem is, I couldn't wear the knee-high boots I was planning on wearing, because though my ankle is MUCH improved and I can walk, dance, and even run on it somewhat normally, I wasn't sure if I was quite ready to take on the world of high heels quite yet (but I was sure I'd be ready by October 31). So I wore my silver flats.

Shereen puts on a low cut black top, black pants, and a hip scarf and goes as a bellydancer. Works for us!

We get to their house. Chad and Aaron are dressed as Mario and Luigi (and noting their use of shrooms, it was a little too perfect), and Jon was dressed as Toad. Grant went as Rambo. He would've been a better Peach.

So we get to the party, and Shereen has about two beers before she is completely plastered. She'd initially rejected Jon earlier in the year, but she decided that she's going to make out with him (while she's sitting in the sink?!) while he's playing beer pong. Their makeout antics were everywhere and getting a wee bit annoying. (Especially on the way back when we are all cramped in the car and Shereen and Jon are making out in my ear pretty much).

But I meet Allison. She doesn't like chocolate or ice-cream like me, and is a LoZ nut. She wants to have a Star Wars wedding. She LARPS and plays WoW. She is also a Go Go dancer at a club in Lansing. She loves sushi. She's friendly and hyper-confident. I'm in LOVE. :)

So after we leave the party, Shereen and Jon go off to do other things and I take off with Chad, Aaron and Grant to some dude's house. Allison calls a little later and we go to Dennys. Then we retreat back to Chad and Aaron's. Didn't get to sleep until 11:30. AM. Only slept a couple of hours. 

The night before this I'd stayed up until 4.

5. Your attitude has actually gotten worse since high school. Grow up for all of our sakes! 

6. Your complete disregard for others and selfishness is one of the scariest things I've ever seen. 
7. I'm so glad you're such a wonderful person. You always bring a smile to my face!

8. I'm glad that I was able to have an actual decent conversation with you. I'm still afraid of you to a point, but I hope we can work back up to being normal again.

"event","So, I sprained my ankle this morning.

I woke up, decided to cross the street to go get some food. Make it down the stairs, and I see the curb. My right leg makes it over, but when I go to put my left leg over, I hear CRUNCH, and look to see that my ankle is in a position that it shouldn't be.

I hobble over to the nearest bench and start to calm myself down, because I could feel myself starting to have a panic attack. I was getting really warm and dizzy, my ears were ringing, the nerves in my head were firing off like crazy and I'd left my medication at home so I was really upset. Then I remembered what the guys at the Obama rally did to me to unfreeze my limbs, so I took off my jacket, and did the breathing exercise. I cleared up and dragged myself inside.

I roll back into bed and call my dad. After describing my symptoms to him, he concludes that it is most likely just sprained, that's a relief, because you know, after hearing my ankle CRUNCH like that...you never know. I take a rest while icing my ankle before calling Shereen to ask her what the hell am I going to do about my classes.

Shereen was an angel all day. She was my crutch and she showed me the bus routes. And to help me feel better, as we left Math, she serenaded me with ""old time-y"" tunes such as Frankie Valli's ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" and ""The Way You Look Tonight"" by Frank Sinatra, and ""LOVE"" by Nat King Cole. Of course, I was singing along while holding onto her and we hobbled and cried [sang] wee wee wee all the way to the CATA station.

She took me to the Union so she could run to CVS to buy an ace bandage for me before she had to go work. She also gave me some of her malt that she got from the Dairy Store. She came back, wrapped my ankle, and dropped me off over by the bus, told me to get on the 31 to get home. And it worked.

I really like Shereen. She's the only reason I'm glad they stuck me in ANOTHER math class, or I probably wouldn't have met her. I want to do something special for her once I get better. No idea what though. And for Renuka, because I know you're wondering, she's a Cancer/Leo cusp."

I slept with him because he looks like Julie. And in the weird and scary department...he's 17. EEEUGH. I knew he was a freshman, but I didn't know he was 17! Eesh. I feel like a cougar or Mary Kay Letourneau or something.

Not only that-- but I was not indentified by name or picture because of the class I was in. I was a helmet. SPARTANBLOGGER108. JUST LIKE THE OTHER 12.

Too bad that didn't happen.

I knew that it'd be tough to find a spot. See, the rally was/is being held at Adam's Field (which is extremely small. Spartan Stadium would've been a smarter choice (to accommodate all those people, if it HAD to be outside...I would've chosen the Breslin Center). Bah, point is-- the doors opened at 11:30 and I had an exam at 12:40. The class and Adam's Field are nowhere near each other. PROBLEM.

So, Shereen asks me in class if I just wanted to bypass the whole thing and watch it on television somewhere warm. I agree. When we finish out exam, we head out, and then she decides that she wants to brave it outside so we can at least hear him speak. Fine. So we walk toward the field, and we see the line...Shereen keeps walking next to the line...I follow her...we get to the front clearing where the press boxes and such are and she makes it clear that she's going to bypass all the people (the line is NOT short) and just walk in. 

Right around now, some old guy walks up to me and tells me that he had a class with me at Western. I do not remember this old guy AT ALL, but he's talking to me and introducing me to his friends like we're old chums. He's getting on my nerves and Shereen just leaves. I call her to see where the hell she went, and she stole someone's ticket off the ground and waltzed right in, and suggested I do the same. I told her to call me when she was done.

I just can't cut people in line, especially long ones like that. It brought me back to the rally in June, when we waited SO long before the doors even opened, and how people were yelling and screaming at me that I got in before them even when I was having a panic attack, going through temporary paralysis and needed medical attention. I just think it's disrespectful to all the people who did wait so long just to have the opportunity to see him. And Shereen saw him on Labor Day, so this wouldn't have been her first Obama rally either.

Maybe I'm old-fashioned. Would you have cut?"

I was worried about hurting him and making him feel awkward. NOPE. That apparently wasn't the problem. He wanted to go out with me again today and I'm like...two nights until the wee hours of the morning is ENOUGH thank you very much.

He wants to see me again tomorrow, and it's just...BLEUGH. TOO MUCH. I guess I should be glad that he really likes me (and he really, really likes me) but I feel awkward because I'm wondering why and I barely know him. He doesn't know that much about me. He really hasn't been introduced to my bubbly/silly side that a lot of people find annoying. He hasn't had any indication of my stubbornness. But he's already wanting to act like we're doing this boyfriend/girlfriend thing, but I am just not comfortable with that quite yet.

I need a breather.

I'd write more to sum up my weekend, but hahaha, unfortunately, THAT'S IT."

"event","My math professor is Ukranian. She started learning English at 50 and she may be in her late 50s now. She's got an extremely thick accent, and drones. It's hard to understand her and she doesn't answer questions very well, no matter how you try to describe the concept to her. So, no one ever goes to class. I'm talking...out of approx. 100 students that are supposed to be in the lecture, 20-30 show up every day.

Today was the day of our lab and we have an assignment due on Thursday. Shereen and I were doing the assignment Monday, and decided we're going to ask Dan, our TA some questions about it. So we bring up the question in class and suddenly we here Irina Kadyrova (the professor) bitching about how Dan is not supposed to solve the equations in class.

(1) Dan was not solving the equation. He was explaining to the whole class about the part of the question that confused me and Shereen.

(2) If Kadyrova had such a huge problem with Dan telling us the answers, she should've waited to tell him, after the lab instead of embarrassing him in class like that.

(3) Shereen and I kept trying to explain the situation, but Kadyrova kept cutting us off to verbally assault Dan.

So Kadyrova leaves as suddenly she appeared in the classroom and the whole class was like, ""Dan, you didn't deserve that."" ""Dan, you didn't do anything wrong."" ""Dan, don't worry about it."" and we actually applauded him. 

Turns out, Kadyrova was lingering outside and called Dan out of the classroom to verbally assault him...again. So we're all freaking out, hoping we didn't get Dan into trouble. And decided if he did get into any trouble, we'd write to the Math dept., because Kadyrova's got to go. Period.

Dan walks back into the classroom and laughs a little under his breath, which triggers giggles across the classroom until I shush everyone because WHO KNOWS WHO MAY BE LURKING OUTSIDE.

She's probably just jealous that people actually go to the labs and not to her lectures to hear her drone on in broken English about a subject that hard to take for most people taking the class. Yeesh!"

I love this school, it's beautiful, beautiful and even more beautiful. It's just so nice to look at.

Yesterday was fun, but it wore me the hell out-- no joke.

I had an emergency drive home on Friday because (1)my computer wasn't working after getting the hard drive replaced a month ago and (2) my mother's eyes were bleeding, my dad was in Chicago, and she wanted to go to the hospital.

My computer was fixed and my father returned Friday night, leaving me open to head back to EL Saturday morning SO I COULD GO TO THE GAME. (Mom's doing just fine, btw. She had some kind of infection, antibiotics cure it all). Problem is, everyone was trying to get to MSU because of the Notre Dame game. So I SPED like a demon on 96 (I seriously went 90 most of the way) and got to Okemos in record time. But I guess I got there when everyone else did and there was a line to get off the freeway. *Sigh*

So I drive home, talk to Rachel, change clothes quickly, and we head out to Old Horticulture & Grand River for a lovely tailgate. After that, I head over to Case to meet up with Andy and his frat friends (apparently he rushed a frat) who were generally gross and skeezy, but friendly enough. 

MSU's student section is amazing. It's fun and loud and vulgar and shit-talkin' and just...I LOVE IT. I was seriously giggle-city during the whole game because of the cheers and the loud, drunk guys screaming, ""ASSHOLE!"" and ""JIMMY CLAUSEN IS A PUSSY!."" However, the student section is a rather rhythmless crowd, as they were never on beat with the band for the fight song or any of the other cheers. Sparty was dressed as a matador; I love Sparty.

MSU won the game and I was working my way through the crowd when I received a call from one Justin Petro. He said he was in East Lansing and the Burning Cacti will be playing a show and Stax Hungry is breaking up because KEWPIE IS MOVING TO ENGLAND (so sad). He gave me Caryn Tegtmeyer's contact and we jaunted over to Lansing to hear the band. It was so fun, and I was giggle-city again: BABY SHARK.

But this past month at State has been amazingly fun. Why didn't I come here sooner?"

"event","Today is Thursday, meaning that I have a really, really, really long walk from Human Ecology home.

Why not take the bus? It would make more sense, right? 

Well, I am too lazy to get a bus pass, and honestly, I enjoy the walk--I get to commune with nature and what not. And I mean, it's what, a 35-minute walk? It's not so bad. Come winter, I will be on the bus though.

I was fully entertained when I saw the ground. MSU has little spray painted images on the ground of people. I was delighted to see Amelie Poulain's smiling face by the Human Ecology building. So I started on my long trek home.

It was a fully lovely day. A good temperature, the sun was out, just nice.

So I'm about to cross Farm Lane road and this guy on his bike says to me, ""You're gorgeous. Cheer up.""

Thing is, I wasn't sad at all. But lots of people have told me that I look really sad or angry when I'm walking. That's my neutral face. I just it's kind of sad-looking. I've got a pouty mouth. I remember some guy at Western said something similar and really got up in my face and told me that I ""should smile because I was just too pretty to be frowning."" However, that guy really got on my nerves because he felt like he needed to say it about an inch from my face, and blocking my way. 

Not two seconds after that I was almost killed.

I'm crossing Farm Lane and I have the little white-you-can-walk-now man signal, so I'm heading along. I hear a LONG and LOUD horn honk, and a crazy woman comes careening around the corner and shouts, ""WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!""

I scream after her, ""IT'S MY FUCKING RIGHT OF WAY, STUPID BITCH!""

...

Yeah, a little vulgar. But okay, here's how it works. MY LITTLE WALK GUY WAS ILLUMINATED. MEANING I CAN WALK. Her light was green, meaning yes, she can turn right, but a-ha. I am a pedestrian. MEANING I ALWAYS HAVE RIGHT AWAY! Even if I was walking in the middle of oncoming traffic. I have right away, because I'm walking, you stupid piece of shit.

Guuh.

But that didn't spoil my long journey. Along the way, I saw a bright yellow butterfly by some construction they were doing on Bogue. It made me smile. It's amazing to see the brightly colored bugs and birds we get around here. I'm assuming they come around here because of the botanical gardens, but I guess they just end up in East Lansing in general, because the Beal Gardens are kind of far from Bogue street. :)

I've got two stories lined up for The Big Green, and I'm on for my Thursday-night dinner-chat with Miss Liz Mundy. 

What a delightful school! :)"

So my friend Shereen and I decide midway through math that we already know the formula for a slope of a line (middle school stuff, right?). So we blow math off and go shopping. We discovered the Meridian Mall in Okemos and looked for warmer clothing and what not.

Yesterday, Shereen asked me if I wanted to go to this party today, er, well, Friday, and I was like sure why not. This party happened to be located at a nightclub in Lansing, and not only that, my roommate Erica, wanted to attend too. No big deal.

So we pick up Shereen's friend Iriana, and we head over to the club. There is a line wrapping around the street for it. We wait an hour and a half in line (this is especially bad because we were set up to pay $1 per half hour for parking (WHOOSH STEEP LANSING!). We get about 15 people from the front of the line when someone shouts that the club is closed and a RIOT breaks out. The bouncer and some dude starts fighting and were closing the doors on each others heads and people were screaming bloody murder (OH HELL!). So we booked it out of there.

Iriana was feeling tired and headache-y, so I dropped her off and Shereen and I headed to the hookah place I went with Andy. We sat down and saw this guy making smoke bubbles from the hookah smoke and bubble solution. It was the coolest thing ever, plus, the guy was kind of cute (in the Lenny Kravitz sort of way). He offers how to teach us how to do it, and soon enough Shereen and I are blowing smoke bubbles too. Then we're chatting with their whole group, playing Candyland. Yes. Candyland. We stayed with these guys until the hookah place shut down at three. Lenny Kravitz guy (Jon) and his elfin-looking troublemaker friend (Grant) decide that they want to hang out with Shereen and I further and the four of us head for Denny's.

Which is where we stayed until dawn.

Yes.

Until the sun came up.

Shereen and I just giggled and recapped our whole day and night together. Like, we're both stumbling around in our 4-inch heels at dawn around Michigan State's campus, yelling and singing and giggling, so I'm sure people thought we were drunk. Nah. Just happy."

So two dudes decide to walk in and I start calling for Rachel and Kaitlyn to see if they know these two weird dudes. They introduced themselves as Joe from Jersey and Courtney from Cali. They were...strange, and odd-looking, and definitey looking to get laid. Erica returned while the two cornballs were here, and she pretty much took care of them. She's funny. I like Erica.

In other news, I saw a girl wearing these today:

<img src=""http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a160/shadowparty/footshoes.jpg"">

I asked her if they were comfortable, she said they were, and they were supposed to be great for your posture (?) and felt like you were walking with bare feet. I asked her if she could wiggle her toes, and she could, and she did! It was so freaky! I actually saw someone wearing foot shoe thingies!

I'm pretty much addicted to the State News crossword ever since I finished one on Friday. I was so proud and so psyched to see the answers (but a little pissed that I had to wait until today to see them). I started today's and it was even harder than Fridays, but I figure this is a great way to pass that annoying long hour and a half block between Mass Media and Math, and at the same time, learn clever vocab words to pepper in my conversations."

So, I saw the price of the ticket and I was like, there is no effing way that I am going to buy 7 tickets for that price! I'd die! So I sat looking at the list of games, trying to decide which I really wanted to go to. 

Then, I called my grandfather, the wealthy MSU alumnus. I asked him which games did he plan on attending and he said, ""ALL OF THEM!"" Great! My grandfather has amazing seats at Spartan Stadium, the same seats every year: they are right on the 50 yard line and really close to the field.

SO--

I am going to the Eastern Michigan game with him next Saturday. My dad is coming up too, because he went to Eastern and wants to see them play. I think my sister plans to come up for Homecoming, so I can attend the Iowa game with her and my grandfather, I suppose. But that is also the weekend of my neurologist appointment. If I can't get it moved up, I won't be going to that one.

I did buy one student section ticket and I plan on buying another. Any other games I want to go to I can tag along with Gramps.

"event","Today, I realized I'm going to hate Tuesdays and Thursdays. Not because the classes are awful, it's because I have weird time gaps AND 30 minute walks! I'm going to have to learn the CATA system before winter hits...or my toes fall off. I also have ECON at 8:30 in the flipping morning.

My ECON teacher looks like Jennifer Garner...a lot. If she were on ratemyprofessors, she'd definitely have the little chili pepper next to her. She also randomly asked if anyone was of Bengali decent at the end of class. Which is odd and specific.

I have one small class, and it's a math lab. Which is made all the more worse by the sheepish TA. I mean, you can tell he means well, but isn't a great communicator at all. I mean, AT ALL. A girl in class asked what my name was, and I told her, and he overheard and repeated it like it was familiar to him, but I'd never seen this guy before ever in my life.

Though it's fucking huge, I really like my PLS class so far. We didn't really study anything but I really like the vibe my prof and his TA give off. Good positive people. It's also nice to be in a class with upperclassmen.

But I noticed that I am a lot bouncier here. My walk definitely shows it. I'll be bouncing around and smiling and dancing a little to my music and no one stares at me like I grew an extra head, they just let me be. So I wiggled to Raspberry Beret all the way home.
I hadn't thought about my mosquitos bites in 2 days and they just started weeping and itching like mad. UUUUGH. Why does it feel so orgasmically good to scratch them? Even more uuuugh."

Since Liz was busy, I got my car and Andy gave me a bit of a tour around MSU/East Lansing. This is where most of the insults occured, on his part about my driving, accented speech, and my Ohio statriotism, and on my part, his uber-sensitivity and emo-ness.

I also seriously needed to gag/retch in the middle of the grand tour. Don't know. Weird sudden wave of nausea. But EL has basically everything they have in Ann Arbor, except it's along one street. 

And though I have had many opportunities to hookah, I never really took one until today. I don't know why. But it was pretty fun. I mean, black lights kind of freak me out, and this place was full of them, but the whole process was pretty cool, and enjoyable. So, I can cross ""smoke a hookah"" off of my list of things to do.

I have to take a few prereqs that Western's system didn't really match up to. The downside is, these classes are filled overwhelmingly with freshmen. Not that I have a problem with freshmen so much, it's just...I'd really like to interact with someone my own age. Hence, why I'm not going to wait until next semester to apply to the publications around State (while still working on my own baby of course). So I'm putting together an online portfolio, filled with clips from years previous and my blogging from RTM. THANK GOD FOR THE BLOGGING FOR RTM! I'm just trying to decide on a look for it. I don't want it to be boring, but I kind of want to keep the air of professionalism. I'm thinking an offwhite col-- you guys don't care about this. Hahaha. I'll show you when I'm done if you want to see.

I'm liking my living situation so far. I live with a few cool gals. Kaitlyn is my primary roommate and is from a farm in Buckley. She's 6 foot tall and likes to work out. YES. Her boyfriend lives at home, so she plans on going back very often to see him to which I refuse to judge her because I hated it when people looked down on me for going home. Erica and Rachel live on the other side of the wall and they're pretty cool too. Plus, Rachel has a 21-year-old brother. Most people see that as, ""OOOH ALCOHOL!"" I see it as, ""OOOH POSSIBLE SEX!"" that is, if he's remotely attractive.

State is so much different than the images I had of it as a kid. I mean, I guess I always thought it was huge, and it is, but I don't know. It's homier than I remember, and is straight up beautiful, no doubt about that. Only issue is, I had a few issues with time. I have a class in the Communication Arts Building and the next class I have is in Vet Med. The classes are an hour and a half apart, and it would be pretty pointless to walk here and walk back, considering it's a little less than a half hour walk back here. So I thought I'd purposely try to get lost and explore some of campus. Nope. That didn't work. I did not get lost. Apparently, I know my way around campus [innately] already. Not surprised, I'm really good with directions, but I ended up being really early. Wah.

But all is lovely so far. I'm supposed to grab DIN with Liz tonight. I really don't want to leave for Labor Day, but I want to see if I can squeeze in a Doctor's Appointment because the vision in my left eye is getting a little wonky."

They also did lab work, and stabbed me half to death because I have extremely small, rolling veins. So my right inner arm is a big bloody bruisy mess. But who knows, I healed fast from that hickey from hell, so maybe if I just keep up on my spinach and raisins, I'll be fine. The neuralgia is a little scary, on the other hand, but I think I'll be okay when I see the neurologist.

I also have the best friends in the world, and its so interesting that we're all moving on to different places very soon. Was that a well timed exit for us? I hope it is, because I see that as a good sign that we will move on and be happy. Julie will have a lovely time in Munich, Renuka will get her learnin' on in Chicago, and Rachael will meet the Viktor Krum/Ron to her Hermione. And as for me? Fresh start is kind of written all everywhere! Hello, MSU!


As for less sentimental things, I cannot believe I found an eyeliner that doesn't smudge. At all. I went a little nuts with the makeup buying last night. It was also nice seeing Julie Wallace fresh from her NYC summer. Since I'm starting the social science magazine (IM or facebook me if I haven't told you about it and you're interested, maybe in helping me out with it), I decided to keep in the loop I need to blog about something. I think a slutty adventures one that we thought up for Julie would be nice, but I or maybe all of us, should do it too. I kept saying that yesterday, but I don't know if anyone heard me because of our tendency to talk over each other or you guys thought it was a boring idea.

The snark of the office is Trever. The dude is absolutely hilarious. He's kind of like Oscar the Grouch (kind of even looks like him, except for...not green) who just sits by his computer and pops out every so often to delightfully rain on everyone's parade. I think that all of the bitterness comes from that his name is spelled with an 'er' and not an 'or' And of course, when he gets upset with something he shouts, ""GOD BLESS IT!""

Courtney had a meeting with the Discovery Channel this morning (trying to get a plug on Planet Green because she's planning two new car awards based on green, hybrid, and eco-friendly capabilities). So, she shows up to the office late. She says that she stopped by the grocery store on the way back to the office and thought she was losing her mind because she thought she tried to get into the wrong car.

Trever responded with this anecdote:

""I was down the street the other day and I saw this guy trying to get into his car. He was getting so frustrated and turning red and screaming and huffing and he finally realizes he was trying to get into the wrong car. When he walks over to his car, I honk my horn and point and laugh.""

Courtney ribs him and says we should throw him in a cage. She announces that she bought more goodies for the office. Little chewy granola bar things, one of which is Curves (the gym apparently has a food brand?) with an excited jumping woman on the box. Trever responds to this (in his girliest voice):

""WOW! Look at me! I'm skinny! And now, I can have a boyfriend. AND FAIL.""

Later Courtney gets a stomachache. I hear Trever shout something about a ""CURVES BAR"".

And this was just today. Trever's face makes me uncomfortable. He always looks like someone just farted and the smell is constantly up his nose. Except when he opens the door in the morning, then his smile makes me uncomfortable. 

I like Rebecca. She's a sweet, nice girl who likes to wear high heels too. But she's a Joss Whedon-addicted fashion nut who loves to cook and is moving to Chicago (Did they just mash me, Julie, and Renuka into one person?). If she weren't my boss, we'd be good friends. But I think we're going to be friends anyway. Especially if Facebook has anything to do with it."

"event","I've made the most enticing, intoxicating absolutely sexy scent ever.

I was worried about the peach and jasmine going together, but they are amazing.

It's got notes of vanilla, cinnamon, jasmine and peach. I have no idea what to call it!

It's sweet, but has a really yummy undertone, and has just a wee bit of floral to break it up.

Now the question is...eau de parfum or eau de toilette?


I also went and looked at some notable fragrances and broke found out what their notes were. I'm not too crazy about Chanel No. 5, but it's you know, the classic woman smell. It also debuted on my birthday in 1921. It's got notes of ylang ylang and neroli, may rose, jasmine, sandalwood, vetiver and vanilla. It smells a little old-lady like to me, I think it's the rose.

When Britney Spears' first perfume came out, I remember a lot of people, particularly Ruba Nsheiwat saying that the fragrance smelled really good, but they didn't want to admit it because they were too keen on Britney herself. I was totally in that camp. Curious has notes of magnolia, pear, lotus, rose, jasmine, cyclamen, vanilla musk, sandalwood and blonde woods.

Calvin Klein's Obsession is another guilty pleasure of mine. It smells really good. Notes are: mandarin, bergamot, vanilla, jasmine, orange blossom, coriander, and amber. Mmmm..


Mine seems really simple next to these, but it seriously doesn't need hyper-blended notes. I love its sweetness, maybe i'll throw cloves in maybe for an extra RAWR.

I love this."

"event","Okay, so Julie and I went to see the Dark Knight tonight, and we started to discuss the other movies that came out during the 90s, trying to keep the characters straight, so I decided to put together a little Batman map before bed:

(1)Batman (1989)
Batman: Michael Keaton
Joker: Jack Nicholson
Harvey Dent: Billy Dee Williams
Vicki Vale (main girl): Kim Basinger

(2)Batman Returns
Batman: Michael Keaton
Penguin: Danny DeVito
Catwoman: Michelle Pfeiffer
Max Schreck: Christopher Walken

(3)Batman Forever (The one with the really sexy soundtrack):
Batman: Val Kilmer
Robin: Chris O'Donnell
Harvey Dent: Tommy Lee Jones
Riddler: Jim Carrey
Chase Meridian: Nicole Kidman

(4)Batman & Robin
Batman: George Clooney
Robin: Chris O'Donnell
Mr. Freeze: Arnold Schwarzenegger
Poison Ivy: Uma Thurman
Batgirl: Alicia Silverstone

I'm sure you guys are familiar with the newest Batman movies. Weirdly enough, the same people played Alfred and Gordon up until the recent movies, Michael Gough and Pat Hingle respectively.

Also, Riddler for the next movie...

Jim Carrey was perfect, but anyone else?
STEVE BUSCEMI, anybody? Or Giovanni Ribisi?"

That whole thing about the older men kind of creeped me out, but I mean, I guess it's true. I honesty don't mind older guys as long as their aren't lying about it (even by omission). So I've gone from random to deliberate, and from a sex dreamer to a sex master (but I think this past year has EVERYTHING to do with that)."

I am so happy with my choice to switch schools I feel like a real dickwad for not doing it last year. State is beautiful (and HUGE) and I met some really cool people right off the bat. I even saw Lily Franklin, who I hadn't seen since high school. It was really nice to talk to her again.

I have a weird burning rash on my shoulder. I have no idea where it came from but it feels just awful, yuck!

Also in the yuck department: The first pub rejected my story. Oh well, NEXT! 

I have been exhausted as hell since Yasaswi's party. We didn't crash until 4:30 that night, and woke up at 7:30. I took a nap that next day, but (foolishly) went to bed at 12, knowing that I had to get up a 5 and drive to State for orientation. I conked out at around 9 last night because I was just so exhausted. I slept until 8:30, this morning, so almost a full 12 hours of sleep. I'm still tired. Yuck.

I can't get with the crazy sleep schedules some people have. I love sleep, and I obviously need it."

"event","What a days!

Yasaswi had such a fun birthday party! :D

I managed to get all dolled up (very pretty-like), pick up Beth and Julie, and we all made it out to Yasaswi's party, where the birthday girl was a vision in butter yellow. It was very classy and swingy and bossa nova, and mmmm...it was nice. At midnight, we did a countdown for Yasaswi's day of birth (New Year). Then the dance music came on. 

So after going crazy dancing with Julie, we migrated out front to the porch swing where I get a call from Andy saying that him and Scott were in Ann Arbor and close to our location. As a surprise, Andy and Scott come over and I bring Yasaswi out because she hadn't seen either of them since high school. Lauren Fowler and Mike Furton (I kept messing up his last name. He had Legend of Zelda sounds on his phone, which was most important) joined later and it was a big P-CEP reunion! 

I later wandered inside with Julie and Beth, and apparently the cops came? Apparently they gave a warning. I didn't know, I saw some guy with a flashy arm bandy-thingy around the side of the house, but I wasn't sure if he was a cop. 

After, we just sat around in the dark, where I was educated on flirting, and talked about statriotism and languages with some dude named Dave, who had a super cool sister Allison. I learned my chatterboxiness paired with my giggly nature can come off as flirting, and I learned that flirting with me is all about intention because I come off as flirtatious! HOW COOL!

Julie was a funny bunny. :)

Woke up this morning, went to Zack's with J&B, realized I left my phone at Yasaswi's, went back to Julie's, cuddled and did some yoga stuff with my Julie-bean and realize how much I love and going to miss her, went back home, played LoZ, and got my phone from Yasaswi's.

I have my MSU orientation tomorrow! I have to get up insanely early and paired with my lack of sleep tonight, I should probably head to bed around...now. But I think I'll watch Bridezillas with Dad."

SO a few things:

I solved the mystery of who crapped on my mom's car. We had no idea what was going on, and the sight of my mother sadly looking at her car with a hose was just...ugh. 

So when I came home from work, I decided to act on my hunch to see if I could find any evidence of what was going on. I see a plastic bag over by the scene (which was covered in pink stuff, toilet paper, white stuff (which was not paint, but glue) and eggshells. I looked in the bag to see if there was a receipt of any kind. No such luck, only wood chips. I look at the eggshells and notice something was written on one of the eggs: ""Taylor egg."" Taylor is the name of our subdivision's bad seed. He's always obnoxiously saying rude things to people, playing hockey in the cal-de-sac and refuses to move when you're driving out, just to give you a hard time. 

I walk over to the Baker's backyard and notice that the wood chips in the bag match the wood chips in their backyard. BUSTED. What a MORONIC KID.

I call my mother and tell her everything I found. When she gets home from work, she goes to confront stupid little Taylor Baker. She comes home in a pissy mood saying that he vehemently denies that he had ANYTHING to do with the car.

A little later, the doorbell rings and Taylor and some other kid are there, asking if they can talk to my mom and creepily call her ""Miss Catherine"". They offer to clean my mother's car and the space that in was vandalized in because they feel ""so bad."" 

Later, June and Ward, er, Taylor's parents, come over and talk to my mom about what the Beav had done. Despite the evidence, they decided that they think that Taylor didn't do it, and suggested my mother call the police. My mom didn't think it was so important that the police get involved, but my dad suggested doing it for shits and giggles, considering the police in Canton probably don't have much else to do.

This was true, because 5 minutes later, there was a cop at our house, schmoozing with my mom. The next morning, super early, there were cops patroling our court.

Uuuhhh...yeah. So my mom's car is clean, and I guess so is the moronic kid's conscience."

"event","Oh holy Shit, whatta day.

I rise early to head over to Julie's so we can see can go to her Contemporary art class and head on over to the Barack Obama rally. Hell yes.

So the plan is that while we were in class, Vikram and Adam would go down and find us spaces in line. Anuj called me midway between class, and told me that he'd tag along. Wicked awesome.

So after some discussion of little pigs, elephant dung, and quite literal playboy bunnies, we head  over to the Joe for the Barack Obama-RAMA. HELLLL YESSSSS.

<lj-cut text=""the reason my hands were palsied..."">
So we were waiting out there, me, Julie, Anuj, Vikram, and Adam (5th in line!). And I noticed that I had to pee. Julie and I started looking for the portable (yet stinky) toilets that they had. They were locked. THE HELL?! So we went up by the people mover station and asked a cop if there were any bathrooms around. The closest was at Cobo. We were not headed over to Cobo, because we didn't want to lose our place in line.

So we decide to go back to our place in line, and while arguing with a bitchy and gruff volunteer, we made it through the front.  My need to pee only got worse and worse, and I started to notice that my hands were feeling numb. I thought I'd just breathe through the numbness in my hands, and that'd calm me down. But the harder I breathed, the more I had to me.

I was getting extremely tense over this,and when an old woman asked if she could go to the bathrooms, I asked also. The guy told me no, so I started to SCREAM at him telling him the only bathrooms they had were locked up for some stupid reason and I can't walk to Cobo and NOT lose my place in line. I was shaking hard by this point and my hands, my face, and my arms were going numb.

Someone escorted me in and that's when I notice I can barely walk and my hands hand completely tensed up. I couldn't move them at all. They were crinkled up and frozen. I kept screaming, ""I CAN'T MOVE MY HANDS! I CAN'T MOVE MY HANDS!"" and they took me to the bathroom. The woman had to sit me on the toilet because my muscles had stiffened SO much that I just couldn't move. After I'd gone to the bathroom, I kept screaming, ""I CAN'T MOVE MY HANDS!"", and was finding it really hard to breathe. They got the EMT, put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me down to the infirmary. They guys talk me through it, help me through breathing exercises and help me unfreeze my hands. They told me that I'd hyperventilated and had an anxiety attack, and that's why my muscles had locked up.

After I was unfrozen, they sent me off to find the rest of my crew. Unfortunately, by this point, I was almost sure that everyone else had made it into the arena (considering we were so far ahead in line). So I found an official looking gentleman (which I later deduced was a secret service agent because he was walking around and dressed like the rest of them) who kindly escorted me to the arena. I eventually found everyone.

The rally itself was amazing. There was a weird lady sitting next to me and Anuj, asking us the time periodically and saying overall weird shit. There were SEVERAL false starts and false hopes of Barack Obama coming out. And then I remembered somthing I heard in the infirmary, so I let it slip to Anuj...

""I think Al Gore is here.""

So we chat along about Al Gore and who should be Barack's veep and what not, and I go to the bathroom (again, yeah, I know, but I was stressed out!) and I hear the crowd go wild. I duck my head back in to see that it's only Chauncey Billups. I return and then, Jennifer Granholm introduces AL GORE AND BARACK OBAMA.

OH MY GOD.

Our seats were really kick ass, so I was within breathing distance of Barack Obama and Al Gore. OH MY GOD. MY GOD. I'd met Jennifer Granholm before, but it was exciting to see her again.

After it was all over, I was kind of left speechless and giggly. Vikram insisted we all get a picture together with a sign. None of us had any swag. I did manage to get a ""Divided We Fail"" button from a AARP petition guy.

Me and Julie went to Zack's where we shivered and awaited Adam's arrival, as Anuj went off with Tom and Vikram decided not to go along. After he arrived and Julie was pretty much done with her food, I decided that I want ""Black Hole Sun"" played at my funeral...as invitations.

Won't you come?

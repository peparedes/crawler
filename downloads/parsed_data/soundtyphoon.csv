"event","well that was fun. what a wonderful trip, I enjoyed myself compleatly as far as numbers went it was a record turnout 115,000 pepole made there voices heard and they were.
hear are some of what i thought were the best slogans from today:

""you will not silence my message,
you will not stop my march,
you will stop killing my brothers and sisters!""

""it seems to me that all those in favor of abortion
have already been born""

every time a child is born, the goddess rejoices,
every time a child is killed the goddess weeps""

""we will be a voice for those who can not yet speak for themselves,
we will be a vote for those who can not yet vote,
we make sure that ourmessage is heard by all""

And thats just a few of them i chose that i thought were the most moving, my father suprised me by coming this year.
but i kinda ignored him once we got off the bus, i fell in with wiccans for life and had a great time talking to others like me from all over the country it was just an amazing expierance one i shall not soon forget
 peace for now, blessed be

Boom, its all over, your life is all over these times are all over. Just cuz you hadda prove you a real soldier. You went out to fight your heart pumping strong, came back in a box your heart had finished its song.
Itwasnt that long just 2 dozen years who knows were youd be with all your ideas your dreams hidden or not a 6-foot box all's ya got now, what could you have now?
Before the end ya hadda try and cope with all the faces you watched die through your scope one more face forever in your brain you took a life it's pain now your pain, yet the love of your wife saved you kept you from going insane, it brought you home, she at your side now, but she all alone crying tears of true love for all the things you said because you cant say 'em now cuz now you dead.all the things you wanted to say, the chances youd have, shit a bullet took em all away.
A bullet ended your song before it had even begun, just a flat crack and a jolt in a terrorist's gun. But you feel no hate for the guy he did what had to be done, hell who knows? he could be just like you : young, scared, with a young wife too. Following commands he just dont understand this war isnt his but it will be remembered long after hes gone who knows? his heart might be next to finish it's song.
So we you left behind sit and cry, and for this we pray that we'll all be toughther one day, comforted by the fact that thers one thing you knew that no matter what happend we love you.


feeling kinda sad had to write this again, matty was the first one to teach me how to fight and how to stand for what i believe in...............................................................................cuz that win was for you i miss you and i love you i will talk to lucria tonight k? dats all for now

I was 15 years old this guy that worked for my uncle was shootin off his mouth now the boss said this would never do. So he called me he says to me ""kid,its time for you to make your bones, you gotta make good by the family,go with uncle branco and take care of biddness, so me and uncle branco go out to staten island where this bum lived we went to his aprtment like 8 pm and branc he kicked the door open and grabed the guy while i watched he through this guy a beatin you wouldnt belive,the dude is screamin for mercy,his mother,or god to help him but branco didnt stop till the bum could barly stand he looks at me an says go ahead kid do what you gotta do. So i pull the ice pick outta my pocket and i pops this guy wit and im popin him with the ice pick blood every where when all of a sudden BAM! the ice pick breaks! the guy is lying at my feat crying to die and im standin there with a peice of would in my hand! i dont know what the hell to do so i ask branco:what the fuck do i do?? he looks at me an says wait for him to melt, OR, break his neck(at this point the kaiser is looking kinda funny and keeps glanceing around john on the other hand is fighting tears of laughter cuz hes italian, and he usta live in the bronx) so i breaks this guys neck as me and branco are walking out i looks at him and i says ""I did good huh unc?"" he looks at me and says yeah kid but if you ever tell anyone about this you gotta kill 'em or else"" right unc no problem. at this point i look at the kaiser and say:are you okay mark? you look kinda pale, you aint gonna die on me yet, are you?he mumbled somthing about having to help his wife and ran off home leaving me and john roaring with laughter in his wake


            three thing never to insult an italian about:

             1. his country of orgin(Italy)
             2.any female within 100 miles
             3.his biddness.      

 other wise the goombah gonna look at you and say: badda boom an punch you inna nose

Twenty-Five Ways We're Different This Christmas! 

1. Last Christmas we were thinking about all the things we didn't 
have; this Christmas we are thinking about all the things we do 
have. 

2. Last Christmas we were placing wreaths on the doors of our 
homes; this Christmas we are placing wreaths on the graves of our 
heros. 

3. Last Christmas we were letting our sons play with toy guns; 
this Christmas we are teaching them that guns are not toys. 

4. Last Christmas we were counting our money; this Christmas we 
are counting! our blessings. 

5. Last Christmas we were lighting candles to decorate; this 
Christmas we are lighting candles to commemorate. 

6.Last Christmas we paid lip service to the real meaning of the 
holidays; this Christmas we are paying homage to it. 

7. Last Christmas we were digging deep into our bank accounts to 
find money to fly home for the holidays; this Christmas we are 
digging deep into our souls to find the courage to do so. 

8. Last Christmas we were trying not to let annoying relatives get 
the best of us; thisChristmas we are trying to give the best of 
ourselves to them. 

9. Last Christmas we thought it was enough to celebrate the 
holidays; this Christmas we know we must also find ways to 
consecrate them. 

10. Last Christmas we thought a man who could rush down a football 
field was a hero; this Christmas we know a man who rushes into a 
burning building is the real one. 

11. Last Christmas we were thinking about the madness of the 
holidays; this Christmas we are thinking about the meaning of 
them. 

12. Last Christmas we were getting on one another's nerves; this 
Christmas we are getting on our knees. 

13. Last Christmas we giving thanks for gifts from stores; this 
Christmas we are giving thanks for gifts from GOD. 

14. Last Christmas we were wondering how to give our children all 
the things that money can buy; this Christmas we are wondering how 
to give them all the things money can't (peace, security). 

15. Last Christmas we were thinking about all the pressure we are 
under at the office; this Christmas we are thinking about all the 
people who no longer have an office to go to. 

16. Last Christmas we were singing carols; this Christmas we are 
singing anthems. 

17. Last Christmas we were thinking how good it would feel to be 
affluent; this Christmas we are thinking how good it feels to be 
alive. 

18. Last Christmas we thought angels were in heaven; this 
Christmas we know they are right here on earth. 

19. Last Christmas we were contemplating all the changes we wanted 
to make in the new year; this Christmas we are contemplating all 
the changes we will have to make in this new reality. 

20. Last Christmas we believed in the power of the pocketbook; 
this Christmas we believe in the power of prayer. 

21. Last Christmas we were sharing / spreading / listening to 
gossip; this Christmas we are sharing / spreading and listening to 
the Gospel. 

22. Last Christmas we were complaining about how much of our 
earnings went to taxes; this Christmas we comprehend that freedom 
isn't free. 

23. Last Christmas we valued things that were costly; this 
Christmas we value things that are holy. 

24. Last Christmas the people we idolized wore sports uniforms; 
this Christmas the people we idolize wear police, firefighter and 
military uniforms. 

25. Last Christmas peace on earth is something we prayed for on 
Sunday morning; now it's something we pray for every day. 



Guarded Joy""

A bearded man (not Santa)
is in the news today.
A broken man with sad brown eyes
was bound and hauled away.

The tyrant has been captured.
The terror king's been caught.
Iraqis cheered because they know
that justice will be sought.

The one who lived in splendor
lay crouching in a hole
when U. S. Forces got their man
like fishing with a pole.

And yet our joy is guarded.
We fear what some may do.
It's likely many more will die
before this thing is through.

Come, Prince of Peace and save us.
Immanuel, we've learned
the joy we long for in our world
won't come till you return.

I firmly believe that it is not for us but for god to judge osama bi laden, however it is mos def up to us to arange the meeting!!!



to all who feel bad for the terrorist cause: GO TO HELL!!!!"

Moshe wants to buy a parrot and goes to his local pet shop to see 
what they have. The assistant shows him a parrot and explains that 
this one is really quite special -- it can speak most languages. 
So Moshe decides to test this out: ""Do you speak English?"" asks 
Moshe.
 
""Yes,"" replies the parrot.
 
""Hablas Espanol?"" asks Moshe.
""Si,"" replies the parrot.
 
""Parlez-vouz Fransais?"" asks Moshe.
""Oui,"" replies the parrot.
 
""Sprechen sie Deutsch?"" asks Moshe.
""Jawohl,"" replies the parrot.
 
""Falas Portugues?"" asks Moshe.
""Sim,"" replies the parrot.
 
Moshe pauses for a while, then asks the parrot,
""Do you speak Yiddish?""
 
The parrot shrugs its shoulders and says,
""Nu? Vis a nose like dis, vot you tink?""

"event","my father being the arrogant jackass that he is, has once again TOTALY FUCKING DESTROYED christmas again for the 3 year in a row he just dont grasp the idea that we dont love the same things he does and that he cant force us to love them
example:big family diner on the eve, simple right? WRONG!!!
has to a certain menu the same one he has had every christmas eve since 1957 no subsitions, or changes of any kind by penalty of haveing to go through a half hour guilt trip
I am the only one this dont work on nemore cuz i talked to granma and she told me he was a little bitch when he was a kid to, noone else remembers her well enough to know that but i do and i learned italian before i learned english so we used to talk all the time. (if you can see this nanan, i love you and i miss u) the other thing that ruins family diners for me is my dad and my brothers have THE WORST TABLE MANNERS IN THE WORLD!!! the chew with their mouths open, they smack their food,talk with their mouths full, hell dad screams with his mouth full,even the to middle ones do this and wont stop no matter whoo tells them, i hate eating with my family just because of this i know retarded children with more concern for the apitites of the others at the table and if i hear one more christmas song that was recorded before 1940 i swear i am gonna kill sombody!!!!!!!!!! 









well thats all about my shitty life sorry for ruining your christmas hope you can still enjoy it merry christmas

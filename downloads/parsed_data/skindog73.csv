"event","""I can get shitfaced, and it'll only cost five dollars?""  How could this night possibly end badly?  It all started when Rabbit and I went across the hall into Howard's room, and said for five bucks each we could share a gallon of Carlo Rossi wine, which was promised to fuck us up.  We get the bottle and pour ourselves a couple cups, but we have to hurry because the college basketball game we were going to was starting in less than an hour.  So I start pounding back a few cups, but decide that I can't feel anything yet and should start drinking faster.  So I funnel a good amount of wine, fill up a poland springs bottle, and head off to the game with everyone.  We get seated in the second level, and we take our seats in the uppermost part, where we could drink in peace.  Then we see security taking out a bunch of people for drinking, so I chug my bottle of wine.  I was beginning to think that wine was a pussy drink and that Mr. Rossi was letting me down.  However, I learned that night that wine is like a fat girl at a party...it'll sneak up on you slowly, and before you know it, it makes you do things that emotionally scar you for life.  It began as a good drunken stupor, with me jumping a few rows in front of our seats to hit on a girl who I affectionately called for the rest of the night ""Martha Sinclair.""

However, creepilly hitting on girls wasn't enough for me that night.  I decided that I'd seen enough of the basketball game for one night.  Despite the reasonable requests of my friends to return to my seat, I obviously had more important things to do that night and started walking over the rows of seats, stepping on movie-theater styled seats, almost falling each time the seats fell down.  I almost got to the end, but my reflexes weren't up to par that night, and before I knew it I was falling over three rows of seats, nailing my chest on the bar of the balcony.  Now some of my friends may say that had the three guys around me not grabbed me and pulled me back from the ledge, I would have surely kept falling onto the crowd below.  But in my current state, all I cared about was that my hat fell below and I needed it immediately, because it's almost impossible to find a new URI hat around here.

(quick note, this part of the story onward was supplied from my roommates, as to this is where I started to blackout)

I got my hat and we all headed back to the dorm.  I'm quite adament about funnelling more wine, so my roommates fill up a few funnels worth and I take it like water...or gatorade, because that's what they really put in it, thinking it was easier to just give me gatorade than to try explaining there's no more wine.  After this I climb up onto my roommate's top bunk and pass out.  ""Well at least he won't be causing any more trouble tonight,"" thought my roommates.  You'd think a normal passed out person couldn't possibly cause any more damage, but I'm not any average person.  They leave me alone and hang out across the hall with our other friends.  They come back to get another movie and I'm woken up.  I decide to frog jump across the room from Rabbit's top bunk to the futon, and commando roll across it.  At this point Rabbit reallizes that his bed is soaken wet, along with the futon.  I would have stayed to explain, but speedy trip to the bathroom was all that was on my mind at that point.  While in the bathroom, my roommates and friends all come to the conclusion that yes, I had pissed all over Rabbit's bed, then jumped on the futon, and pissed on the futon while all of them were in the room.  So they all go into the bathroom and yell at me for pissing everywhere, and I'm screaming back at them.  However, it's hard for me to yell seeing as I'm sitting on the toilet, shitting, and throwing up into the toilet at the same time.  The cost of half a bottle of Carlo Rossi:  $5.  The cost of doing laundry the next day: $20.  Having a fractured sternum or rib(still not really sure what I fucked up but it still hurts): priceless"

"event","So around mid 1st semester I still had yet to pop my Providence cherry. Going to a bar didnt sound to appetizing to me up until I remembered Skindog was gonna be there and was going to be drunk, I couldnt pass that up). So we get to the bar and things are goin pretty well hanging out, having a few drinks...only the type of situation Skindog could ruin. But before I get to Skindog's escapades in the bar let's talk about Jeff. Now Jeff is not the biggest, nor toughest, but he is pretty damn pale...I dont really know where I was going with that one...but anyway, the main bulletpoint of my presentation is that Jeff should not be picking fights at bars. But that didnt start our wee lil' friend from starting shit with the sleaziest looking guidos in the bar. I walk over and see Kate, another tiny person, hiding behind Jeff saying ""You're a Tool"" to the greasy dicks. I stepped in and saved Jeff's life...again. 

Now one would ask ""Where's Skindog in this whole situation"", ""Shouldnt he be backing Jeff up to"" well my friends i'll tell you where Skindog was, he was at the other end of the bar...sleeping, yes sleeping with his pitcher of beer...Too goddamn cute. I went over and of course showed everyone that he was sleeping, thats just my style. After a quick 15 minute nap on the bar in a very noisy room, Sunshine decided, It was Time to show this bar the art of Dance. Now Skindog showed everyone in the bar who the real lord of the Dance was. Well actually Skindog's method of busting a groove involved finding someone with breasts then humping the shit out of them, Regardless of if some other guy was with her. After being denied by almost every girl in the bar Skindog  had finally found a girl to dance with, who to his credit wasnt bad looking, no the real beast was waiting in the wings. Let me explain, I had been following Skindog around making sure he didnt do anything that would get him kicked out. Once he found the poor girl who he danced with i figured I'd leave him alone. But what i didnt know was this girl had a very scary big friend who saw that i was with Skindog and pounced. She grabbed me and latched on, she made me the woman. Up until that night i laughed when health teachers told me rape could go both ways...i laugh no longer. So after 2 songs she relinquished her kung fu grip on me and said ""I need another drink, I'll be right back, dont go anywhere"" lets just say i was in stealth mode the rest of the night. I was a phantom of the bar. This meant i had to leave Skindog, a regretable decision, we'll get to that later. 

Now I thought the situation with Jeff and the greasequeers was over but all of a sudden i walk over to my friends and we're in a stand off with the guidos. Normal shit talking is exchanged, and then some kid lunged at howard and gave him quite the shove, the bouncers immediatley interveined and dragged the tough guy away. So we have another stand off and once again Skindog is absent, where was he this time? He had been put in timeout. Thats right bars apparently have timeout, and jay did something to be put there. To this day we still do not know why the 4 bouncers grabbed Skindog and dragged him to the couch near the door and made him wait til close, all we know is these men were not happy with him. So after this we leave the bar and make our way to our cars...Of course Skindog takes a nosedive off the street into the sidewalk. We decide to grab some pizza at this great place Antonios. Skindog felt it necessary to sleep in the car while we went and got some food, apparently i was the only one who thought it was a good idea to leave Skindog alone in a car, at night, in the winter, in a city he doesnt know, but we did anyway. So after the pizza Howard, Videira and I are on our way back to our car when we see a party goin on in a building near the pizza place. We were in. We walk up the stairs and find out it was a Brown party, we explain how we're all on the football team for Brown...they actually bought it. We hang around for 15 minuntes and then decided to leave. Howard decided to take a souvenier from the party, a handle of Bacardi. So we leave and get back to the car, Skindog was still asleep, dreaming of Meredith. We make our way back to URI and Skindog still wanted to stay in the car. So of course we left him there. The next morning he came up to the room at 7 in the morning and explains that he did indeed sleep in JT's car still thinking we were in Providence. It was a good night."

"event","I'm sure most of the contenental United States has heard this beauty of a story, but I'll try to give you the full, unadulterated, story.

To tell the full story I have to begin the night before. Skindog had wandered down to the other end of the hall and stumbled in on some kids drinking. Naturally Jay went in the room and to his amazement a girl immediatley was all over him. I came across Jay as I was on my way to the bathroom when an obviously torn Skinner came up to me. ""Tommy, this girl is all over me and she's wicked drunk. Should I tap that."" Now I'm a good person but I decided that itd be funny to entice him, because I love a good embarassing story for Skindog. To my amazement Skindog decided to stay away from the girl. I thought to myself ""Where did this new sense of values and standards come from? Where is my lovable Skindog? These questions were answered the next day...

The next night Jay figured it was OK to go after the piss-ass drunk girl as long as he had had a few drinks himself...phew he's back...he asks me to join him in this girl's room...hmmm should I go watch Skindog make an ass out of himself in front of a bunch of girls, or sit in my room and study...We all know the answer to that one. What followed was awkward dancing and even more awkward making out between Skindog and his lady friend from the night before. Ahhh college. I had a few shots and decided to sit down and just watch this disaster happen. After about 5 minutes of making out with the girl(Which he later told me he didn't think anyone saw...Skindog, you were making out with a girl in a tiny room with 5 people there) the two love-birds left the room. (Note: Skindog was indeed nodding his head towards me when he left the room as if to say ""That's right Tommy she's mine, Royal Flush..."") After about 30-45 minutes of waiting and laughing about what they could be doing in that room, Skindog and the girl came back to the room, Skindog awkwardly told me it was ok to go into the room if I wanted. So I went back in and lied in bed. While i was lying there I heard some curious slurping noise, being the slooth that I am I casually rolled over and saw...I shit you not Skindog and the girl spooning and Skinner slurping on her ear, whilst she was sleeping...one of the more deeply disturbing things I've witnessed. 

The next morning Skindog came over and told the story of what happened for those 45 minutes with the girl once and only once. He explained that they came back to the room and began some heavy petting naturally clothes then came off and they were off. Skindog was giving it to her as hard as 3 inch pecker could give it. He flipped her over and it was time for the two to do it like they do it on the discovery channel. So after some good ol' fashioned doggy style the girl turned around ripped the condom off, (which landed across the room next to my boot) and began some oral pleasure for the Skinnmeister. As Skindog was about to come to fruition, he explained the situation the the dirty girl,(or so he told me, frankly I'm a lil' skeptical as to how loud he gave this warning, but anyway i digress...) She took and swallowed his load as Skindog told me ""Like a Champ"" Now one would think this was degrading enough because she had also received some of his seed in her hair, but thats not where Jay stopped. As they were getting dressed The cumguzzler noticed Skindog had found some minty Tic-Tacs. She politely asked Jay a question...heres the convo

CumGuzzler - ""Do you Think I could possibly have one of those...or maybe two?""
Skindog - ""Alllright...you've earned it.""

I shit you not, these were the words Skindog said...

Skindog only told this story once and only once and only to me. I took some heavy pride in the fact that nearly everyone at URI and Marshfield knows this story."

"event","Another first semester story.  I'd spent the past couple weeks in a drunken haze, mostly involving hookups with many women whose bmi's were higher than their IQ's, and the entire 4th floor of my dorm seeing my penis.  So, call me a pussy but I didnt feel like drinking that particular friday night.  I was resolute in my decision no to drink.  However, what I wasn't prepared for was the persuasive power of my neighbor Howard.  It just seems like ""Oh God, don't be such a pussy"" is more convincing of an argument than I had previously thought.  Howard had been drinking the half-filled handle of bacardi he had stolen from the Brown party the other night, and by midnight, he got me to take a shot...then another, and another, and another, and on and on.  Around 1 we go downstairs and watch these kids eat some shrooms and one of them plays the best rendition of Sublime on the guitar I had ever heard in my life.  They invite us to join them for a bonfire in the woods next to the freshman parking lot, but say that they won't be there for a couple hours and to call them then.  So we go back to his room and finish off what was left of the handle.  We decide that still being able to stand isn't acceptable, so we invite our neighbor in to drink with her, her boyfriend, and the other girls down the hall they were drinking with.  As soon as we are left alone with their alcohol, Howard and I pour most of it into a poland springs bottle and leave.  We procede to drink the rest and move on to our destination: the bonfire in the woods.  We get to the end of the freshman parking lot and cut through the thin layer of trees at the edge.  Past that is wide open land, covered with dirt.  We start sprinting across the open land to get to the far-away forest.  However, half-way there we get to a steep cliff, at the bottom of which are two GIANT dumptrucks.  We immediately give up our pursuit of the bonfire and climb up the ladder to one of them.  We get in, and BINGO, keys in the ignition.  We turn it on, and start it up.  After about 10 minutes of pushing buttons and lifting levers, it starts to move and we're crusing.  Then Howard takes a turn and 2 seconds later it's stuck.  So, we take the keys out of the dumptruck, climb into the other one, and my goal is clear:  drive the truck up the hill, across the field, through the trees and pull up right up to our dorm and park it outside, only to procede to go to bed.  However, howard wants another turn and it is immediately stuck.  We are forced to walk back to the dorm with only the keys to the trucks to prove it.  

You'd think this would be the end of the story, but I forgot to mention that I had to do a community service project the next morning at 8 a.m. in order to pass one of my classes.  Since I didnt start drinking till midnight, I was shitfaced at 8 a.m.  On the busride to the place, I took my pants off, ate half a box of munchkins, and hit on every single girl on the bus.  Once we got to the community service project, I proceded to flash the shocker sign everytime our teacher went around to take pictures of us helping out.  At lunch, my teacher freaked out on me in front of everyone for my horrible behavior, but I didnt think I'd done anything wrong.  Maybe it was because I showed up drunk for a school-sponsored volunteer program, maybe it was because I hit on the TA, but most likely it was because I was flashing the shocker and making inappropriate jokes at a volunteer project working with kids...at a home for sexually abused kids.  Yea, that last one was probably the straw that broke the camel's back."

"event","This is Tommy Hughes, Skindog's roommate, friend and sex-slave. I was recently asked to recap the many mis-adventures of Skindog. Let's start from the beginning. His year started out with the best intentions. I was under the impression that my roommate was a smart, upstanding member of society, not a sexual deviant...I was wrong. I had heard rumors of some of skindog's more unfortuante encounters with questionable women, but i didnt think it over too much. Well The first week went by without a hitch, until the first Thirsty Thursday of the year came around, when we were introduced to the more colorful side of Skindog. Skindog had decided to go out to Providence with the girls we knew from our town. Seemed like a reasonable idea...right? right??? wrong. Rhino and I were watchin a movie around 2:38 when we lost our skindog innocence. All of a sudden the silence was broken and Skinsack burst in the door, piss ass drunk. He, natuarally, began yelling and dancing around. The two, obviously very patient women, decided that Skindog needed to lay down. He layed down, but not before he made the girls tuck him in and kiss him goodnight...He then professed his love for one of the girls as she was walking out, whispering ""Good Luck"" to me. This is where the fun started. Well, embarassment for Skinner, awesomeness for us. He stands up with a glazed look in his eye, and begins explaining how amazing the club was and how he hooked up with a girl (not impressing us, for we knew who she was). At this point, like any warm-blooded college boy would do, decided to take off his pants and underpants. Well this seemed like the oppertune time to start taking pictures, and ohhhh the pictures we took. Let's just say self fellatio seems reasonable for our roommate...One of these days we're gonna catch him with his legs in the air...one of these days."

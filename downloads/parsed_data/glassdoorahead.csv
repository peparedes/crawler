"event","so i never really talked about the reno trip...in the beginning when we first got to the airport i was sooo excited and thought it would be LOADS of fun but once we got there...it wasnt...

first day: we basically did nothing but sit around and walked everywhere and fell asleep to all these bands that either sucked hardcore or were good college bands. either way it was boring. so when we got back everyone was complaining that we should do something so we just randomly started a pillow fight (i think that was that night) and then stopped like 5 mins later. then basically nothing. but it was a late night cuz i went out of my room when we were suppose to be sleeping to go talk and then went to bed.

second day: that was our performance day and we were all pretty confident having heard the bands the last day cuz they sucked. we played well except for our last song where we just went off not thinking. and our pictures were taken. i think the silly one will be funny. but anyways we went back to change and hang out and eat. like 10 of us were all jammed in sydneys moms car to get food, it was pretty awesome. then me tatsuro justin and kevin went to get pizza instead of subs and ended up waiting for like 45 mins. yeah then we found out our scores and later found out we placed 2nd.

the prank...so on our way home (still on second day) me justin and margaret decided to have a little funn and get some laxidives and put it in someones drink. well me and justin were looking for a while and margaret had left with taylor. then ah ha! we found it, ,only took 15-1hr to work. so we bought it and made our way back. we decided the lucky victim would be kevin but somehow got switched and bi began to drink it. we were all cracking up (the poeple who knew). then finally showed bi what was so funny. well about 5 mins later we realized it was suppose to be anally inserted which made it even more funny. until we found out if u swwallow it u should contact a doctor RIGHT AWAY!...so we were all freaking out but in the end after other stuff happened it was all ok and we all (me justin and margaret and a couple others who laughed) were like worshiping bi. then that night me taylor margaret and janelle did face masks things woot!

third day: woke up way early and ate/packed then left for the airport. plane ride home consisted of a lot of seat switching. then once we got seated me thomas kevin david and bi just played cards and listened to music a little. then we were home

so yeah that was basically it. after the first day it got a lot better and im sure i left  A LOT of stuff out but thats ok. alright im done"

SOCCER/BBALL: im always torn between the two! grr why cant they just take what they can get...but whatev, theyre coaches,  what do u expect?

FRIENDS: mm k so everyone, if ur gonna change for the better, DO NOT do it for me or anyone else...do it for URSELF! its too easy to get tempted when ur ""being good"" err whatever for someone else and its definatly too easy to get mad at the person and do the ""bad stuff""  so yeah it might be good to stop doin bad things for someone, but its a hell of a lot more reliable/longer lasting if u stop for urself...and thats my advice of the day

yeah that was kinda weird but whatever...mm k so basically my life is goin pretty well except i  have gangca hw to do! mm k well ill get started on that...im done"

"event","ok so yeah i prolly shouldnt have called them ignorant or hypocritical cuz i guess u could say that every religion is hypocritical towards other religions or whatever. but that was the first time ive ever been exposed to that kind of stuff so it was sort of shocking.  but yeah i just didnt feel comfortable there especially since i didnt agree with a lot of the things that they were saying. i mean i like the people there when they arent talking about the election or how other religions r silly but idk. ill try to get more information on the church and see if thats how everyone acts or if theyre actually respectful towards other people. i guess i care about this so much cuz my brother is in that church and i dont want to think of my brother as this mean guy thats not acceptant of people with different beliefs. idk maybe ill just go join joans youth group lol. w/e ill just talk to david about it so i wont be so grrr anymore. mmmmm k im done"

"event","ok my brothers church seriously bugs the crap outa me. heres the story about my day at his church...

there was this i think guest preacher who was black and was tellin us a story about how there was big racial issues up at monroe and how he went to talk to a couple kids. well the administraters were telling him its more of a tolerence for other races rather then a respect thing which i agreed with him in the fact that that was messed up. so anyways then he said he visited skyline but he wasnt a llowed to be introduced as a paster or whatever and everyone was like ""gasp!"" and yeah. then he called up a few people to tell them something they remember opr whatever and he said ""there was this girl who came up and read something out of the book of mormon"" and everyone startted to laugh which pissed me off. then he said ""and some other girl that was a catholic or whatever"" and yeah. then he said ""then there was a girl whos friend died of anorexia and read her favorite book, ,the bible"" and everyone was like yeah! so i was felling kind of awkward but then like whatever...then after those stories we all came together in prayer and someone was like ""bla bla bla elections bla bla and crush the democrats"" and everyone laughed and i was thiunking ""ok racism isnt just about color u idiots!"" then they started to pray about the marriage thing and all of it was just such BS i couldnt believe it. they r the biggest hypocrites ive ever seen.  if they wanna hlp to change all these racial issues, then theyre gonna hafta also respect the values, opinions and beliefs of other people. and that doesnt mean they hafta agree with them, but at least be respectful that its there choice just like it was there (my brothers church's choice) to become the type of christians they are. theyre just so ignorant and hypocritical!

and yeah thats about it...im done..."

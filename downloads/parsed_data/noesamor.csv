"event","WHEN WE GIRLS DRINK TOO MUCH............ 
1. WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHERE OUR PURSE IS. 
2. WE BELIEVE THAT DANCING WITH OUR ARMS OVERHEAD AND WIGGLING OUR 
BUTT WHILE YELLING ""WOO-HOO!"" IS TRULY THE SEXIEST DANCE MOVE AROUND. 
3. WE'VE SUDDENLY DECIDED THAT WE WANT TO KICK SOMEONE'S ASS AND HONESTLY BELIEVE WE COULD DO IT TOO. 
4. IN OUR LAST TRIP TO PEE, WE REALIZE THAT WE NOW LOOK MORE LIKE A HOMELESS HOOKER THAN THE GODDESS WE WERE JUST FOUR HOURS AGO. 
5. WE DROP OUR 3:00 A.M. SUBMARINE SANDWICH ON THE FLOOR (WHICH WE'RE 
EATING EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT THE LEAST BIT HUNGRY), PICK IT UP AND CARRY ON EATING IT 
6.WE START CRYING AND TELLING EVERYONE WE SEE THAT WE LOVE THEM SOOOOO MUCH. 
7. WE GET EXTREMELY EXCITED AND JUMP UP AND DOWN EVERY TIME A NEW SONG PLAYS BECAUSE ""OH MY GOD! I LOVE THIS SONG!"" 
8. WE'VE FOUND A DEEPER/SPIRITUAL SIDE TO THE GEEK SITTING NEXT TO US. 
9. THE MAN WE'RE FLIRTING WITH USED TO BE OUR 5TH GRADE TEACHER. 
10. THE URGE TO TAKE OFF ARTICLES OF CLOTHING, STAND ON A TABLE AND 
SING OR DANCE BECOMES STRANGELY OVERWHELMING TO US. 
11. OUR EYES JUST DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO STAY OPEN ON THEIR OWN SO WE KEEP THEM HALF CLOSED AND THINK IT LOOKS EXOTICALLY SEXY. 
12. WE'VE SUDDENLY TAKEN UP SMOKING AND BECOME REALLY GOOD AT IT. 
13. WE YELL AT THE BARTENDER, WHO WE BELIEVE CHEATED US BY GIVING US JUST LEMONADE, BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE WE CAN NO LONGER TASTE THE 
GIN. 
14. WE THINK WE ARE IN BED, BUT OUR PILLOW FEELS STRANGELY LIKE THE 
KITCHEN FLOOR (er, or, the mop?) 
15. WE START EVERY CONVERSATION WITH A BOOMING, ""DON'T TAKE THIS THE 
WRONG WAY BUT..."" 
16. WE FAIL TO NOTICE THAT THE TOILET LID'S DOWN WHEN WE SIT ON IT. 
17. OUR HUGS BEGIN TO RESEMBLE WRESTLING TAKE-DOWN MOVES. 
18. WE ARE TIRED SO WE JUST SIT ON THE FLOOR (WHEREVER WE HAPPEN TO 
BE STANDING) AND TAKE A QUICK NAP. (OR AT A FOOTBALL STADIUM) 
19. WE BEGIN LEAVING THE BUTTONS OPEN ON OUR BUTTON FLY PANTS TO CUT DOWN ON THE TIME WE'RE IN THE BATHROOM AWAY FROM OUR DRINK. 
20. WE TAKE OUR SHOES OFF BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT'S THEIR FAULT THAT 
WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WALKING STRAIGHT. 
SEND THIS ALONG TO ALL THE GIRLS YOU KNOW WHO LIKE TO HAVE FUN. MAKE 
THEM LAUGH AT THEMSELVES LIKE YOU PROBABLY DID..."

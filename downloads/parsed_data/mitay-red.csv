"event","i am so bad with money. right now i have 250 in my bank account, and hopefully thats accurate cause i have not been writing anything down in my register.  oh well.  i think, although im not sure that 150 of that goes to my mom for insurance and the rest i need to pay on my credit card with.  too bad, cause it would be nice just to spend it.  

im somewhat tired and fat today.  i ate really good till dinner when my mom made blt's and fries and brownies.  i had no choice, i had to eat a lot.  we have my grandpa over for dinner once a week and i always feel so fat afterwards.  im going to go and hang out with ken in like 20 minutes, but its rather chilly out.  im going to wear scruffy clothes.  

so i think i really will change my major.  i know thats weird and badly timed but i think i want to major in sociology, and then just minor in english cause im only 2 classes away from getting my minor.  i was also thinking that since i hate my job so much, that i should take some time away from my normal classes and take some medical transcription classes.  i already work at a hospital and that pays better, plus often times they have you working at home.  i would really, really, really, like that.  then i would no longer have to deal with the annoying wenches i work with.  it's too bad cause some days they can be really pleasent if they werent so too faced.  i actually wouldn't care that much except my mother gets really worked up about it, to the extent that her blood pressure actually went up yesterday. 

well, im going to go.  everyone have a good night!"

"event","so i skipped biology again today so i could type my paper thats due tonight.  i only have a page a half left and i'm actually really liking it.  this is the first paper i've written all semester that i've put enough effort in to like.  well, maybe there was one more.  

last night sucked so much. i had to present this bio of some poet who i cant even remember the name of and i had all my notes ready and i could completely do it, but for whatever reasin i just blanked out and got really nervous. i felt like such a goon, my professor probably thinks im a huge slacker.  that class scares me so much cause she's a really tough grader and she always knows when your slacking and the class has only ten people in it. it sucked, i though i was going to cry.  that was at the beginning of class, its three hrs long.  by the end i thought i was going to have a nervous breakdown.  the whole time i was begging for her not to call on me ( in my head of course:) because i could not think straight and i was stressing out about the paper im writing now.  then ken called to say he was having some crisis and couldnt hang out cuase he had his son, because his son's mother was in the hospital or something like that, which just added to my already shitty night.  cause naturally i'm screwed up and ken could be the greatest guy in the entire world, but i just don't down right trust people, anyone. that sounds cliche and whiney i know, but it's like innate or something.  i blame my father and rob:)  just kidding, although maybe i'm not.  did i mention i think i may have issues with sex?  

then i broke down in my car in the parking lot crying, eventually got on the free way to drive home and dan called.  and i love him and all, but i just wanted to cry at that point, so i did:)  im sure he wont even remember it.  dan's one of those people you can converse with without conversing cause like he just talks and talks, you dont have to ask him anything cause he makes sure you know everything.  i went to sharlee's though and sat on her bed and talked and laughed about gross people and felt better. I'm much better today cause i got to sleep and i'll see ken on his lunch break and we can talk.  i just refuse to let myself ever be as exposed to someone as i was rob.  

im doing the ""great weight race"" at work.  im on a team with the new girl, amanda-the singing girl i used to hate but now can get along with, and tonya. is we're the team that loses the most total we win money.  fun stuff.  I just want to lose ten pounds and maybe the five pounds i swear i have gained but have yet to show up on the scale.

well, i should finish my paper now.  

oh, oh, i think i want to change my major."

"event","hello.

sorry its been so long.  i just forget to do these things.  i seemed to be just fine about keeping a journal when nothing's going on in my life, but then when you would think i would actually have stuff to write about i don't.  

lets' see updates:
-dropped my math class, which was really nice, although i did study my butt off for the first test and i got a B on it.  i was proud, but then when it came time for the second test i was way behind and realized i didnt even need the class, so droped it the night of the last day to drop.
-i may have cervical cancer.  actually that's me being melodramatic. there's a small chance i could have it.  i have pre cancerous cells.  we are going to do this thing to determine if it's cancer or not, and if its not then i believe they burn the pre cancerous cells off and then they wait to see if that works and if it doesnt they may go away on their own or they could develop into cancer, and if it is cancer i believe they can just remove it. i don't know all of it though, i have a doc appointment on tuesday, so i'm sure she'll explain it all to me.  it's not that big of a  deal, cause you rarely die from it but it still sucks.  at least its not like ovarian cancer or something, cause then i would die.
-i met a boy-guy-man, whatever you want to call those things:)and he's really great, and i like him a lot, as in i actually have real, genuine feelings for him. it's somewhat refreshing and he's really good to me and cute and sweet and i don't ever want another guy again:)  i know i sound completely childish, but i don't really know how to explain in brief any other way, expcept i care for him a lot and he makes me really happy. 

well, i should go now.  i have to drive all the way into boise unfortunately  to go to the library at the college.  i have so much to do tonight, it sucks and i feel really fat today."

"event","my guitar teacher is 35!  i have the biggest crush on him and he's 35!  he could be married for all i know, although he doesn't wear a ring.  he's not even someone who i would normally be attracted too, and yet, somehow i have a crush on him.  i'm fairly sure it's the music thing, and the way he talks to me, or the way he laughs, or just he fact that he's really tender in the way he teaches me.  it's too bad i didn't practice anything this last week cause i've been so busy with school.  

i love my two night classes, which are 19th century poetry and poetics and then my intro to education.  my biology class isn't actually that bad when i pay attention, but i hate my math lab.  it's horrible.  first all of the homework is online, but you have to come to the weekly class, although no one teaches at the weekly class, the teacher's just there if you need any help, and yet attendence counts as part of your grade.  then, if you actually do want a lecture, you have to come back that night ( i have the class at 2:30) at 7.  is that not the crappiest set up on the world, not to mention i am so bad at math.  im not even supposed to be in that class cause i didn't take the math class prior to it. sharlee signed up too, only they sent her an email saying they removed her because she failed to meet the prerequisite, so i have no idea why they didn't send that to me, but they didn't. which is good cause i need the 4 credits, if i pass that is. 

somehow i need to be able to go to work or school for most of the day, practice my guitar for an hr, go to the gym for an hr, do homework, and sleep on average 6 hrs a night every day.  that would be the ideal.  i don't know if it will happen though.  

i miss will and grace.  i love that show, and now my station is all fuzzy.  the guy who teaches me guitar, his name is rick, was saying that music wa his release, which made me think that i'm unsure that i have a release, and if not i should get one, cause i imagine i would be a whole lot healthier.  now that i'm over the realization of my massive crush on my guitar teacher, i'm slightly embarrassed about my first paragraph, but that's ok. i will keep it.  maybe its not as big as i though.  he is probably married and i am so weird.  

i met a random girl at the college the other day.  this guy was playing at the sub, so went to listen and i shared a table with this girl and we talked for like an hr and listened to the guy play and then went and bought his cd together. it was fun and random and she was really nice, and normally i'm not comfortable with girls i don't know, but she was great.  i should meet random people more often.

well, im gonna go and try and do everything i want to do now, so wish me luck."

"event","John is gone and classes started yesterday, so everything is back into full swing.  Last night I had 19th century poetry and poetics.  I really, really, really like it. I've had the professor before, and she's really hard (I got a B in her class the last time, I scored an 89 on everything!  It was very frustrating), but she's also really good.  It's a three class, from 6 to 9, which might prove to be really long, but last night wasn't bad, although she did cut it short by 45 minutes.  It's a small class, only 17 people?-I think.  The annoying woman with the long, really pretty black hair and pale skin, who has no job because she has a hundred kids is in my class.  This is the third one in a row,  it's a good thing that she's actually beginning to grow me. The best part would be at 7:30 when all of a sudden Joe walks in.  I love Joe soooo much.  We had a poetry writing class together last year and he is amazing.  He's great and he's a really great writer, and not in that cliche ""I'm a writer, I think I'm really deep, I make my own clothes and cloth bag"" sort of way.  He's really good, and very attractive too.  Then I had biology today, which sucks, cause I hate biology and the girl sitting next to me was really nice, but far to enthusiastic...  damn have to run, finish later:)"

"event","I was bad and since Sharlee and I decided that the food you eat after midnight doesn't count, I went through Jack in the Box and got taco's and jalepeno poppers. I actually only wanted taco's, but they're 2 for a dollar and I felt dumb ordering just that and then using my debit card to pay for it.  I'm a geek and tomorrow when I feel fat I will know why.  I only ate one meal today, so I would say that it should be O.K., only the one meal I ate was huge.  John and Sharlee and I went out to eat at Cafe Ole and I ate so so so so so much.  It was really good though.  I need to start eating healthy.  I'm actually somewhat excited about shopping for good for you food.  I don't think I will be to psychotic about it though.  Sharlee and I were so good last summer about it, but I don't think I have that in me, and I'm not as fat as I was last year.  I'm actually somewhat O.K. with my body.  My goal is to lose ten pounds by my birthday.  I want to be more toned too.  I think I wil just keep my calorie intake at 1200 a day and then make sure to eat both fruit and some sort of vegetable at some point in the day and then I'll have to hit he gym.  There's no way I can make it five days a week though.  If I could just work out with Rob twice a week and do toning things, or do yoga on my own and then do hr long cardio's three times a week I think I should be able to do it.  Hopefully, even five pounds would be nice. 

I'm so poor and yet I bought Ryan Cabrera today.  I'm really bad about that. I need to at some point be good about my budget.  It's a pretty good c.d. though.  I have yet to listen to it all.  

I did a lot of writing today, or at least I did a lot of writing in the last 30 minutes.  Ahhh, I also saw Ryan today- talk about very akward.  My goodness.  I thought I would die.  John wanted pop so we all stopped at the store on the way home and of course he was working, and for whatever reason sharlee and I were laughing so hard.  It was so akward though.  He really hates me, and I understand why and then I don't.  I do feel bad cause he spent a lot of money taking me out and he bought me roses, but I honestly did not like him, and I was really standoffish most of the time, and he grossed me out.  Plus he liked me before he knew me, which bothers me.  It's like he had this preconcieved notion of me, and he already liked the person that he thought I was, and even if I may have been that person, he didn't know it first hand.  I can't quite describe it.  I hate the fact that he thought he knew me, and I hate the fact that he looked at me the way he did and it was like he though I would be really taken and swept away by that, but it's too bad that it just creeped me out.   blah, now I'm all flustered and grossed out.  Hopefully I don't see him too much on campus.  Remind me never to date again.  

Rob and I went to ""The Library"" last night (coffee house).  It was fun and I beat him at chess, and this lady kept talking to us the whole time.  At one point Rob was sitting down on the couch beside me and I was like ""I really like your butt Rob."" and so then he said something about doing squatts and then he went into this whole schpeil, and all of a sudden she's asking him if he's a personal trainer and how huge and masculine her calves are and then some story about it.  She was nice, but we were talking really quietly and I hope she didn't hear a good portion of our conversation, because if taken out of context I'm sure came across really funny, especially because earlier I was checking out guys on this picture board that was up and Rob was commenting on them and then we checked out girls, then we're on the couch together being somewhat touchy.  We worked out last night too, and I did not try very hard.   Next time I will though.  Shao lin- that's what its called.  I've been trying to remember.  Then he does this push hands thing, and you have to put a blind fold on and you push each other back and forth, but try and keep your balance, and he looks like a geek, but really sexy at the same time.  I left jewelry there, that he brought to his work for me to get today. I'm actually all Rob-ed out for a while.  

Well, I'm sleepy and I want to watch Paul Mccartnely one more time, so I should go.  One more day and classes start:(  Everyone have a wonderful night/day."

"event","I'm so tired and I shouldn't be cause I just woke up from a nap.  My hair's a huge mess and I have to try and figure out how to tame it before I can go out.  It's stringy now and I hate it.  I would wash it again, but I am too lazy.  

We drove up to St Chappelle's and around the snake river and ate a really fattening lunch at some ""world famous potato"" restaraunt.  It was good though and I don't feel as fat after drinking a ton of water and taking a nap.  

Rob's not dead!  We watched friend Paul on dvd last night and then hung out till like 4.  I only slept for 4 hrs last night and then 2 this afternoon- henceforth  being really tired.  He gets off early today so we're going to go and get coffee, although he'll probably be hungry, so I should be nice and let us go get food instead.  I'm sure he's not too terrible excited about the coffee shop, it's just that they usually have someone playing there on friday and saturday nights and I wanted to see who it was.  

Well, I think I'll go make my hair look normal and practice my guitar so I don't look like a complete goon at my lesson Wedensday:)  Night"

"event","John is here.  He's actually already in bed.  We picked him up at the airport at 7 and we got home like 50 minutes ago and he's already in bed.  I forget that he goes to bed early and then gets up early.  It's too bad I've been waiting all week for today cause I can stay up as late as I want guilt free and then sleep in.  With my luck they will wake me up at like 7 and make me go somewhere.  They mentioned something about Snake River Canyon and wanting me to find out where it was exactly.  It's weird to have John here.  I'm happy about it and he looks really good and I think my mother's happy.  But it's weird, just to see his arm around her.  I haven't been around that since I was thirteen.  If I ever have problems showing affection it's because I've lacked seeing it for so long:) I'm fairly sure they want ME to go to bed too.  But instead I'm in the kitchen with the t.v. on so they can feel free to do whatever.  I would seriously leave so they can have alone time, but Sharlee's out with her Aunt tonight and Rob is sick and has to work at 6 in the monring till Saturday.  I actually haven't heard from him in a while, I hope he hasn't died.  Not that I we talk that often, cause we don't;  but today at work Carrie was talking about her sister's husband's friend's cousin who went into the e.r. and had some odd strain of strep and then a week later died.  Rob has had a sore throat since last tuesday, and when I talked to him on Sunday he sounded horrible, so hopefully Carrie's sister's husband's cousin's friend is not Rob:)  That was a really long run on sentence.  More than kissing Rob (which believe me is nice) I rather enjoy just joking with Rob. It's the way we get, where it's this high, happy, flighty feeling and we go back and forth between the two of us and the whole time I'm laughing or smiling and his eyes get all happy and lifelike and he's looking at me that way he does.  That's what I like the best. I'm not in love with him.  I could most definately never spend the rest of my life with him.  But I do love that feeling I get that I only get from him.  It's not a crush feeling or an in love feeling or even an extremely happy feeling, it's more like a comfortable- don't want to be anywhere else, safe feeling.  I would trade never kissing him again just to have that every time I was with him.  

It's so hot in my house right now and my dog is being so funny and whining at my mother's door.  She'll be fin as soon as I'm off the computer and sitting with her somewhere.  

I was watching Paul Mccartney again today and I cried when he sang ""Hey Jude"".  I cried because he's up there singing this song- and the entire audience is singing along, from 70 yr old men to 7 little girls and for whatever reason that completely takes my breath away (sorry for the cliche:)  It just makes me happy.  That's why I love music so much, that's why I love concerts. It's the whole concept of a stadium full of people with different backgrounds and beliefs all singing the same lines, feeling nearly the same things despite the many differences between them, because at that moment you're all in the same place and all that matter's is what's going on right there at that time.  I love Paul Mccartney.  I should be an art activist:)  

I think when I have my own classroom I will hang my John Lennon poster up.  It's just a profile of his face and then the song lyrics to ""Imagine"".  

John was funny about my tattoo.  I love hearing that I will regret it later.  Because in all honestly I don't think that I will.  I guess we'll see, but I'm pretty confident in it.  He talks to Wendall the same way that he did Pepper, although I have yet to here the classic ""I know you're a dog. I know.  I know that you're a dog.""  But we have till Tuesday, so I'm sure it will come up.  

Well, I should go read or go to bed or something. Have a wondeful weekend everyone!"

i cleaned my room today, so it's clean when john gets here.  it took me forever to get started.  i came home and lolly gagged forever and then i made dinner and watched part of the paul mccartney ""back in the u.s."" concert and then finally, after napping for a bit, i had the energy to clean. it looks nice, hopefully it will stay that way through the weekend.  i haven't watched all of the concert. i rented it.  i watched the last quarter of it when it was aired on tv and it made me happy cause he cried after singing ""the long and winding road"".  althoug i never quit know how to take him, not that it matters. i've read so much of john lennon that i'm bias or something.

this thing that I consider my only art of fucking people over</b>
My boss just quit the job says he's goin' out to find blind

The 3rd Planet is sure that they're being watched by an
eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promise land your gonna shake that

Your heart felt good it was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees felt cold and wet on the grass to me
Outside naked, shiverin' looking blue, from the cold
sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby cum angels fly around you reminding you we used
to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
A 3rd had just been made and we were swimming in the
water, didn't know then was it a son was it a daughter
When it occurred to me that the animals are swimming

another had been found another ocean on the planet
given that our blood is just like the Atlantic
And how

"event","Why have i found two stupid lists in 5 min haha its okay they made me laugh..


How To Raise A Greek Daughter...

<b>1. Never let your daughters spend the night anywhere, except at a fellow Greek's house.</b>

2. Spend their whole life trying to find them a husband and disapproving of every one they find on their own.

3. Spoil them rotten, but make them feel guilty for it when they ask for something.

4. Fathers - tell them their just like their mothers when you're mad. Mothers- tell them they have their father's head when you're mad.

<b>5. Always compare them to other greek girls (preferably those they can't stand) when trying to make them do something.</b>

6. Complain that their clothes are too short, too tight, too low cut, too black, too cheap, or not right for church.

7. Brag to your friends about how beautiful and smart they are, but tell them to make their sons to stay away.

8. Press for them to marry a greek man, but then ward them off any Greek man you see them with. ""He's okay, but his mother is crazy."" ""His father cleans up goat shit."" ""I heard his has a big house but he locks his yiayia downstairs, do you want to marry someone like that?"" ""No policemen.""

9. Tell them they eat too much or not enough, depending on the situation. 

10. Let them run around naked as children, but make them dress like nuns as adults.

11. Complain they spend too much money shopping, and then go out and blow $1000 on a poker game or gambling.

12. Tell them they never keep their car clean enough, even if your vehicle is covered in dust, reeks of smoke, and has empty coffee cups and food crumbs covering the inside.

13. Force them to be nice to people they can't stand, while you talk about those same people like they are dogs. 

<b>14. Have a fit when they use the word 'malaka', but use it yourself as if it were going out of style.</b>

<b>15. Let their brothers get away with murder.</b>

16. Embarass them by getting drunk at name days, Easter, festivals, etc, and then dancing the zembekeiko.

<b>17. Assign a name to all their friends, and use them at inappropriate occasions (i.e. the mavro, the fat one, the ugly one, the dumb one, the slut, the chinese one)</b>

<b>18. Never let them leave the house after 10 O'clock.</b>

<b>19. Force them to go to church, join GOYA, dance in the festival.</b>

20. Tell them ""good greek girls don't behave that way"" as many times as possible within a lifetime.

21. Buy them gold jewelry even when you know they only wear silver.

22. Fathers - always leave your shirt unbuttoned at least 3 buttons, exposing chest hair and gold cross, when going anywhere with your daughters.

23. Expect them to know all of the Greek dances - except for the tsiftetelli. 

24. Make them believe that Greek women never have sex.

<b>they forgot to mention malaka/vlaka for name calling friends i.e. Vic lol...don't worry they secretly love you..well maybe not but me and anna do!</b>"

"event","New Jersey Driving Tips 

1. Turn signals will give away your next move. A confident New Jersey Driver avoids using them. 

2. Under no circumstance should you maintain a safe distance between you and the car in front of you, because the space will be filled in by somebody else, putting you in an even more dangerous situation.

3. The faster you drive through a red light, the less chance you have of getting hit. 

4. WARNING! Never come to a complete stop at a stop sign. No one expects it and it will result in your being rear-ended. 

5. Never get in the way of an older car that needs extensive bodywork, especially with PA, NY or Del plates. With no insurance, the other operator probably has nothing to lose. 

6. Braking is to be done as hard and late as possible to ensure that your ABS kicks in, giving a vigorous, foot massage as the brake pedal violently pulsates. For those of you without ABS, it's a chance to strengthen your leg muscles. 

7. Never pass on the left when you can pass on the right. It's a good way to prepare other drivers entering the highway. 

8. Speed limits are arbitrary figures; given only as a suggestion and are not enforceable in New Jersey during rush hour. 

9. Just because you're in the left lane and have no room to speed up or move over doesn't mean that a New York driver flashing his high beams behind you doesn't think he can go faster in your spot. 

10. Always brake and rubberneck when you see an accident or even someone changing a tire. This is seen as a sign of respect for the victim. 

11. Learn to swerve abruptly without signaling. New Jersey is the home of high-speed slalom-driving thanks to the Department of Public Works, which puts potholes in key locations to test drivers' reflexes and keep them alert. 

12. It is tradition in New Jersey to honk your horn at cars in front of you that do not move three milliseconds after the light turns green. 

13. To avoid injury in the event of a collision or rollover, it is important to exit your vehicle thru the windshield right away. Wearing your seat belt will only impede your hi-velocity escape from danger. 

14. Remember that the goal of every New Jersey driver is to get ahead of the pack by whatever means necessary. 

15. In New Jersey, 'flipping the bird' is considered a polite salute. This gesture should always be returned. 

Thank You, The New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles"

<b>Friday:</b> Went into the city with berkley college...ehh the only fun part was going to glamour magazine and getting to shop for 30min. It was okay...i dunno if it was worth $65 though..
Later that night I went to Hooters with everyone from work, after that we headed back to the mall at around 11:30 and started working lol. I was there till around 2.

<b>Saturday:</b> Me Vic and Anna all went into the city. It was a lot of running around at first but we eventually got there. Our first stop was urban outfitters, Vic bought a sweater and I bought a t-shirt. It was very hectic in there. We walked around in the west village for a little bit then we realized we had nothing to do there so we headed towards Times Square. Walked around there jeez its insane there. Grabbed some food at T.G.I. Fridays and headed back home. It was a good time. Popped Vic's cherry lol. 

<b>Sunday:</b> Got all ready to go to red white and blue..it was closed lol so me anna and vic decided to go to quiznos instead. MmmMmm. After that we went to Maywood bakery. And then home. Went to sam's club with the family and bought everything possible lol. Finally I'm home. I finally got to respond to Rob's emails. Ate Dinner. Did some Laundry. Shower. Tv. Sleep. Wake up. Work. School. ???

I don't think I've stopped to breathe these last 2 weeks.

<b>For Your Information:</b> the MTV store SUCKS.   Quiksilver in Times Square, not as cool as the one i work at.   Viva La Bam might be my new favorite show.

I cant even begin...i came home tonight and this is what I read as my horoscope for today. ugh. Im so tired right now you have no clue..and Im way to stoned to be typing right now. I have to get up early tomorrow for that berkley thing again. fuck im too tired i just wanna drop out of school and work in retail ::gasps:: did i just say that?! lol omg time for me to a-go-go hah i need to stop now.

"event","Me and Vic discovered the yellow brick road tonight. I couldn't have found it with anyone else lol.

Im bored and had a capuccino hours ago and i still can't sleep.

I eat a lot really late at night.

Me and Vic decided we hate being smothered by the opposite sex. Rob keeps saying I'm gonna dump him. And I'm not going to, I told him to stop saying it today. I like him a lot I just don't like being in people's faces about it. 

Daniela's birthday is in a week! Mine's next Tuesday...I just want to get it over with. We're going out Saturday...I still have no clue what's going on with that. I just don't want to drive that night.

I'm so broke it's not funny, my capitol one bill is late. I lost the envelope and I don't know what to do...I have to figure that out tomorrow...

I have a psych test tomorrow...thats gonna suck. I also have a 20 page paper due Thursday that I have yet to start. It sucks cause when the tests and the papers start rolling around so does my procrastination, hopefully I can get past it this year. Pray for me.

My lips are starting to get really chapped..it hurts.

It's cold tonight

&hearts;goodnight."

"event","and all our sins come back to haunt us in the end
to hang around and tap us on the shoulder
and smile
silent
it's all implied
""you'll die trying to live this down. you might as well forget it.""
still, i'm convinced that wondering what if is the worst thing there is
so we bottled and shelved all our regrets
let them ferment and came back to our senses
drove back home and slept a few days
woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be
all these lines fall short of what i had in mind
a failed attempt to capsulize a feeling
so i just try fail and try and try again
someday i swear i'm going to get it
because i'm convinced that giving in is the worst thing there is
we'll get over it
sad, strong, safe and sober
we'll move forward
and know where we went wrong
but ""you can't go home again."""

"event","So I didn't want to post about this but I have so much damn time on my hands I might as well.

Yesterday we went to the city, Me, Rob, Trisch, Daniela, and Ilya. We went to China Town. Got some chinese food and plugs. Saw Danny from Real World New Orleans. Trischa got a ticket fucking sucks.

Went and got my paychecks, yes multiple (2). Me and Rob parted ways and discussed later tonight.

Came home blah blah blah. Decided to go see Shaun Of The Dead with Vic and Daniela. My mom came home told me not to go, but I convinced her to let me go.

Went and got Vic. ((should have stopped to get gas here)) Proceeded to pick up Daniela. There was a huge accident right off 208 that just happened. Picked up Daniela. The I finally decided to get gas. We We pass the accident again on the way to get gas, we're all looking. Everyone was going slow looking at the stupid accident. I wasn't paying attention (due to the fact that I was looking at what happened) next thing I know the guy in front of me stops and I was ready to go, so I went to go hit the gas before I fully turned around (STUPID!) and the guy stopped and then I stopped but it was too late and I hit him. I was going maybe 10mph. So nothing big. The cops were already there so they saw what happened. Basically to make a long story short nothing too bad happened to the other guy's car. I don't know what the reports gonna look like though. I just got my car back today there's no front bumper on it cause they have to order a new one. But they fixed the lights. I don't have any air condioner right now cause the way the car got hit, it hit the ac radiator. So i have to get a new one and a new bumper. We had to put down $350...it's gonna take to get the parts cause new parts are expensive so he's gonna go find used ones...

This blows. Everything was all nice and good and all I wanted to do was go to the movies. And I've been thinking so much into it. Like what if I got gas earlier..or what if I listened to my parents and just didn't go out. ARG. But whatever like Rob says shit happens. I had to get into an accident I never have before it was bound to happen sooner or later I'm just glad it wasn't worse than it was and no one got hurt. And thank goodness I wasn't there a little bit earlier cause maybe that could have been my car in the other accident.

So it's all said and done now. And I have a lot of spare time now since I will not be going out. My parents didn't say anything to me, but I'm taking it upon myself to just stay home for a while. So I will be making many mixes and I'm sure my room will be very organized and clean lol.

I know for sure I would have never made through the night without Rob yesterday. He's the best boyfriend ever. Oh and Vic was a good friend too lol. You and your damn myspace pictures..I still can't believe you said that.

p.s. Me and Andy hung out way too much today. Played video games, Ate some pizza, Went skateboarding (well I took the easy way out and took the longboard). Good times.

Oh it'll be some time till we get 405 going strong again with this accident now and all. Donations will be appreciated lol.

Love,
Sophia"

I have a guidance appointment on Monday to figure this all out. I'd like to see myself going by next Fall. This is finally something I really wanna do and I'm excited for. I'll probably major in Fashion Merchandising Manager...and then go around the world and shop. HA. awesome. It's what I do. Shop, I'm good at it and I can help others shop so why the fuck not do it for a living?! okay enough.

i took the 405 and drilled a stake down into your center, and stated that it's never ever been better than this. i hung my favorite shirt on the floorbaord, wrinkled up from pulling pushing tasting.
you keep twisting the truth that keeps me thrown askew.
misguided by the 405 'cause it lead me to an alcoholic summer. i missed the exit to your parents' house hours ago. red wine and the cigarettes: hide your bad habits underneath the patio.</b>"

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES
""Modern Day Emma Goldman""

we were two girls who had it all
made a team together
left a trail of heartbreak in every town

we had it all planned out
every face another name on the list
they'd know about us from miles around

1,2,3,4...
watch your back now!
there's a larger threat than what's implied
our time is now!
and i gotta have faith to win the fight

be my strength, i'll be your backbone
always danger of the unknown
our battle has no end
we keep on going, keep on going now

back pocket filled with matches baby
we're ready to set the fire
like the burning, burning in our hearts
of revolution plus desire

go!
watch your back now!
yeah the old rules no longer apply
gave us the roles to fit in
we told you where to stick them
and i gotta have faith to win the fight

Last night .
Marissa, Sophia and I went to Toys R Us .  And explored .
And we bought <b>Tamagotchi's</b> .  
Because we're awesome like that .

Sophia got a girl .  She named it Joey .  Although she calls it bitch, rather than use it's real name .
I got a boy .  His name is Elliott .

We hope to have them mate .  And make little Tamagotchi babies .

Here are some pretty fun-filled pictures from last evening .

i went to warped tout lol...

i saw some bands we got there at like 6 so here's who i saw:

<b>Bad Religion</b> they were okay they didnt seem to put too much effort into their set.

<b>Anti-Flag</b> i like anti falg im not crazy about them like anna but they put on such a good show they were really good they tore bush apart lol they were all about the elction coming up

<b>NOFX</b> 5 years waiting and i finally see nofx lol...they were okay...funny...they were just being silly but would do you expect they played a lot of slow songs which i enjoy...they all look the same too its crazy fat mike el hefe and the two eriks all look like they did like 4 years ago lol...i enjoyed them it was worth the wait

<b>sugarcult</b>when NOFX was finishing up nofx and sugarcult did a song together it was cute...sugarcult..what to say i wasnt excited to see them cause theyre so trendy but i gotta give them credit for putting on a good show

<b>Story Of The Year</b> ....::sigh:: so good hehe i was so happy to see them i wanted to see a bunch of other bands too but ive seen like every other band before but them...they were amazing i was so happy jumping throwing their guitars...crowd surfing..so punk rock lol jk...yea it was good i dont know what else i can say about them

okay that was warped tour...me and andy were at the main stage the whole time cause it was rainging and gross so we just stayed there...there were mud people that just looked gross...we got there so late that i didnt buy anything even though i didnt have money anyway since i payed for andys ticket to i spent $75 at warped tour fucking rideculous $37.50 for tickets WTF!?!!! oh well its said and done...

"event","so im back officialy...worked today....i remember why i didnt miss it but then i remembered why i sort of did... ;)

so i have to save money like crazy...and here are the reasons why:

+im going to greece summer '05
+i want a labtop mmm
+a new camera which i dont actually have to spend that much on cause mines broken and i get to pick out any camera i want at best buy for $230 and all i have to do is buy the warranty YAY!

so thats pretty much my big expenses...greece is most of the saving...the laptop i can maybe get away with getting that for christmas or paying for half or something like that... the camera is nothing...so im figuring if i put aside like $100 for each paycheck i'll be good..depending how much im getting paid hopefully ill get my fucking raise soon...we'll see...

okay im tired now i think its time for a nap

"event","Here is the setlist from the recent magnetic fields show at the annie russell theatre in winter park. It was pretty much an acoustic set with live banjo, cello, acoustic guitar, piano, and ukulele. A lot of the songs sounded different from the album versions, especially with the live strings replacing synths and such. Very nice.

i was born
i don't believe in the sun
a chicken with its head cut off
i looked all over town
come back from san francisco
i don't really love you anymore
all the umbrellas in london
if you don't cry
born on a train
i wish i had an evil twin
i don't believe you
all my little words
i thought you were my boyfriend
a pretty girl is like
swinging london
smoke and mirrors
the book of love
reno dakota
if there's such a thing as love
papa was a rodeo
all i want to know
it's only time

yeah! oh yeah!"

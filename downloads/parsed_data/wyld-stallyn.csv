"event","Ted didn't really have a lot of stuff to take with him. Sure, there was his guitar, his amplifier, some more music equipment, clothes, albums, video camera, recorded tapes of Fandom Radio and some photos, but it all seemed to pack up pretty nicely into a few bags.

Everything was out on the lawn waiting when the familiar crackle of the time travelling phone booth could be heard. Ted turned around and sure enough there it was, complete with Bill S. Preston Esq.

Ted blinked and looked at his wristwatch. ""Dude, you're early!""

""I know!"" Bill grinned. ""I wanna stop by Kahuna Burger before we go to the 28th century.""

""Oh,"" Ted replied. ""I'm not ready.""

""But dude, all your stuff's here.""

""Well, yeah,"" Ted said, ""But I didn't say goodbye to Earl.""

""Who's Earl?""

""My giraffe, dude.""

Bill narrowed his eyes. ""You're not talking about your...you know,"" he waved in the general direction of Ted's crotch. ""Are you?""

""What?"" Ted looked down, then back up at Bill. ""No! I mean a *real* giraffe. Wait here.""

Ted disappeared into the house and returned with Earl. ""Bill, this is Earl. Earl, this is Bill.""

""Hey little giraffe dude!"" Bill said, waving.

Earl blinked.

""Dude,"" Bill whispered. ""He's kind of short for a giraffe.""

""That's because he's a *miniature* giraffe.""

""Oh."" Bill grinned. ""Okay. I'll start loading up your stuff."" Bill grabbed the amp and headed back to the booth, leaving Ted and Earl to talk.

Ted stroked Earl's neck while Earl nibbled on Ted's hair. ""Now Earl dude, we talked about this. I have to go away. Maybe you can come and visit, but Fandom's your home, dude. I don't want you getting eaten by dinosaurs or aliens or anything, so you can't come with me. But..."" He was a little choked up. ""Those little dudes that found you are gonna take good care of you, okay dude? Especially that emo kid, Hamlet. He'll feed you all the bread sandwiches you want and if you ask nice-like, I'm sure he'll take you on a trip to Terre Haute or Hotlanta."" Ted scratched behind Earl's ears. Earl nudged him. ""You take care, dude. I'll send you postcards.""

""Professor Logan?""

Ted turned to see Kawalsky standing on the road. Earl trotted over to say hello. Ted looked forlorn. ""Hey dude. Thanks for picking him up.""

Kawalsky nodded. ""I'll make sure he gets home."" Kawalsky lured Earl away with a piece of bread, but as they walked away up Apocalypse Avenue, Earl stopped and looked back. Ted was still standing there, watching them leave. Earl blinked at him emphatically. Ted raised a hand to wave goodbye while Kawalsky and Earl both turned and disappeared into the night.

""Ready to go, dude?""

Ted looked around at Fandom. ""I'm gonna miss this place, dude.""

""Maybe they'll ask us to play a gig again and we can come back.""

Nodding, Ted shrugged. ""Maybe.""

""Let's go. We've got babes to save.""

""Babes?""

""Rufus did tell you that the future was full of most bodacious babes that need us to save them, right?""

There was silence for a few moments. The sounds of two air guitars came out of nowhere. Bill and Ted grinned at each other. ""Excellent!"" Bill entered the phone booth and dialled the number.

Ted took one last look around and stepped into the phone booth. The door closed behind him and and he nodded at Bill. The phone slammed down into the cradle and electricity crackled around the phone booth.

A second later the booth and its occupants were gone.

"event","Ted's trips to the mainland were few and far between these days. After all, who needed to leave when there was a Kwik Stop within walking distance? But sometimes a dude had to do what a dude had to do. Cravings for burritos counted as one of those times.

A long time ago, Ted would have thought you weren't sharing the good stuff if you told him that a phone box would appear out of the sky out front of a Circle K. But he'd been there, done that and got the A+ on the history assignment. So when the phone box appeared out of the sky outside of the Krazy Taco, Ted kept eating without a care in the world until he saw who stepped out of the box.

""Rufus!"" Ted exclaimed with a mouthful of burrito. Chewed refried beans sprayed over the parking lot ground. ""How's it going, dude?""

""I'm afraid it's not going well, Theodore,"" Rufus replied. ""Or it won't be in about a week.""

Ted frowned and swallowed his mouthful of burrito. ""Well, why not?""

""In a week's time, something big is going to happen. I can't tell you what, but I can tell you that on Sunday morning, William will be arriving in Fandom to pick you up. For good.""

""For good? Like, forever?""

""Nothing is forever, Theodore, but for a long time. The fate of the future depends on you.""

Ted was distinctly feeling a sense of woe. He had to leave Fandom. He had to pack up, say goodbye to his student dudes, sell the house and go. That was bogus. He knew it had to happen one day, but not at such short notice. There was one thing he had to ask though.

""Can I bring my giraffe?""

""Somehow, I don't think Earl would appreciate the close confines of time travel in a phone box.""

Ted's shoulders sagged. He eventually nodded in acceptance. ""Okay Rufus.""

""One week,"" Rufus said. ""Theodore, relax. The fate of the future rests in your hands, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun. You'll return to Fandom some day. If you need me, you know which number to dial.""

Seemingly calmed by the knowledge that he wasn't leaving forever, Ted waved. ""Later Rufus!""

He wolfed down his burrito and headed back to the causeway.

"event","<lj-cut text=""OOC background for Ted 'Theodore' Logan"">

Professor Ted is Ted 'Theodore' Logan (Keanu Reeves) from <i>Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure</i> and <i>Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey</i> and <i>Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures (cartoon series)</i>.

Short premise of those movies is:
Excellent Adventure - Bill & Ted are actually rock gods in the future because of their band, Wyld Stallyns. But for now they're members of Wyld Stallyns and high school students in San Dimas, California in 1988, and they're about to fail their final history test. If they do, Ted's dad (Captain Logan, police chief) will ship him off to military school and the band will never reach rock god status. Thus, the peaceful future brought about by Wyld Stallyns music will never exist. So this guy from the future Rufus (George Carlin) gives them a time travelling phone booth and they collect persons of historical significance (and meet some medieval babes that later come to the future and become their girlfriends and band members), bring them to Bill & Ted's present and have one kick-ass presentation that helps them to get an A.

Bogus Journey - Bill & Ted have graduated, but they still aren't good at playing music, but they need to enter a Battle of the Bands to become noticed and famous. Only thing is that a bad dude from the future sends evil robot copies of Bill & Ted back to kill present Bill & Ted. They do, and Bill & Ted go to Hell while evil robot Bill & Ted ruin their lives on Earth. Bill & Ted get out of Hell by beating Death/The Grim Reaper at Battleship, Twister and assorted other games. They go to Heaven and get in by mugging some people and quoting song lyrics at the gates. Then they get to talk to God, who sends them back to life. Bill & Ted, with the help of a weirdass alien genius named Station, beat the evil robot Bill & Ted, get their girlfriends back, use time travel to learn their music in time for the Battle of the Bands, totally kick ass and become rock gods.

The first movie was better, but the second was still neat. The cartoon series followed Bill & Ted on more time travelling adventures. The only thing I'm acknowledging from here is that the San Dimas Elementary School Library is after Ted for keeping Little Red Riding Hood out since he was 5 years old, and that the dudes went on more time travelling adventures. Because really, that's all I remember and I can't find the episodes anywhere.

Anyway, I'm taking Ted from after Bogus Journey, only he's not married. He's sorta on a long-term 'break' from his relationship with one of the medieval babes. After the Wyld Stallyns' first world tour, Rufus decided it was a good idea for Bill & Ted to get some life experience. Bill's off doing his own thing and Ted ended up teaching music at Fandom High.

<b>Ted in Fandom</b>
He's a music teacher. He says 'dude' a lot and will call persons of the female persuasion 'babe' or 'dudette'. He's definitely a child of the 80s. You know the turtle dude in Finding Nemo? Totally based off Bill & Ted.

Ted lives at 18 Apocalypse Avenue in the house with the green roof. His current roomies are Tommy Oliver, Josh Lyman (gone for the summer) and Elle Woods. His former roomies were Autolycus and Rita Skeeter. He's also the caregiver for Earl the miniature giraffe, who lives in the back yard in a specially made giraffe house next to the artichoke garden.

Personality-wise, Ted is very dopey and dense. He's usually cheerful and LOVES Twinkies for the excellent sugar rush they provide. Sometimes he eats a little too much sugar and ends up with a sugar hangover. He's fun-loving, music-loving and completely oblivious.

And he looks like Keanu Reeves with a shaggy hair cut.

"event","Ted was sitting on the front lawn in a deck chair. He wasn't up early so much as he hadn't been to bed yet. There was still plenty of time to nap and then get up to go and teach class this afternoon. Ted wasn't doing anything in particular. This was attributable to the countless Twinkie wrappers strewn across the grass. He'd spent the entire night and early morning getting over a sugar overdose.

Remember kids, don't OD on sugar. It turns your brain into a lumpy, foaming mass that looks a lot like Dr Phil. It's not pretty.

When he saw the miniature giraffe standing in front of him wearing Secret Disguise Sunglasses (TM), a Secret Diguise Hawaiian Shirt (TM) and a Secret Disguise Lei (TM).

Ted blinked.

There was a Secret Disguise Suitcase on the ground beside the miniature giraffe.

Ted blinked again, then leapt out of his chair.

""EARL!""

Earl blinked back at Ted.

""Dude! I thought you ran away!""

Earl blinked.

""And then I got this message from the Giraffe Mafia telling me to stop looking for you or they'd hurt you! It came with a bread sandwich with a knife through it dude.""

Earl blinked and flared his nostrils.

""Dude. Weak. It was all a hoax? Just so you could go to Hawaii for a holiday?""

Earl blinked, as miniature giraffes do.

""I was worried about you."" He rushed forward and hugged his giraffe pal. ""I'm totally glad you're back, dude! Come inside and I'll make you a bread sandwich. It's fresh!""

Earl leaned down picked up his Secret Disguise Suitcase (TM) in his mouth, then casually followed Ted inside.

It was good to be home."

Ted wasn't going to give up, but wandering aimlessly would do no good. He had other plans. And, well, he had classes to teach too. So Ted was back for now. He reached the house and <a href=""http://imanaturalblond.livejournal.com/4792.html"">headed inside</a>.

"event","Ted was sad. He was in despair, morose, glum, forlorn like a someone broken, woeful and lacking in the serotonin his body would normally use to make him cheerful. He needed a twinkie, but even the normally delightful sugary treat couldn't cheer him up. That was saying a lot. Twinkies cured everything except the loss of best friends. This was almost as bad as the time Ted thought Bill had been killed by the medieval dickweed. Almost bad because there was no medieval dickweed, and Earl wasn't dead (that he knew of). But he'd still lost a friend.

It was his fault that Earl was gone.

He guessed the best way to make the guilt go away was to go and find him.

It may have been hard to make out.

I didn't wanna walk through snow
I know I made you cry
But Earl-dude

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back the stuff I did that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd stay here, stay here
Like you used to do
If I could turn back...

My world was snowing, I was torn apart
Cause I had a warm office
And I didn't want to depart
But I walked out that door
I swore that I would find you
But I got attacked by snowmen with Bridge-dude
Too dumb to tell you I was sorry
Too dumb to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was dumb, and Earl-dude

D: Student comes to classes and fully completes 1 out of 4 projects.
F: Student failed to participate or complete projects.

<u>Project grading:</u>
A: Project kicked ass. It was role-played, completed, done with pizzazz and handed in on time (or with an extension).
B: Project was great. It was completed and handed in on time (or with an extension).
C: Project was decent. It was said to be handed in, but no actual work done.
D: Project was done. It was handed in late and/or unacceptable.
F: Project was not submitted during acceptable time frame.

Pretty much what happens is that I decide that a project is worth a set amount of marks. I'll then go through the project and grade it based on how good it is.

<u>How the Class Works</u>

Classes

1. Ted (or a guest lecturer) gives a lecture on the topic of the week. This will involve a somewhat ridiculous discussion about the music of a particular area of the multiverse (OOCly a particular fandom and its instrumental/incidental music soundtrack or something I made up).
2. Ted will pose a discussion topic or in-class discussion-based assignment.
3. Students sign in and participate in the discussion as much as they want. The funnier the better in this class.

Sometimes there will be small homework pieces. Usually it will just require you to come to class the next week and answer a question or do 'show and tell' with an item related to the topic. It just gives your character a week of ICness to sort it out.

Projects will be given every 3 weeks or so, depending on my availability (ie: it will be approximately 3 weeks, give or take a week if I'm particularly busy one time). Depending on the size of the project you'll have 1-2 weeks to complete it. Don't worry. The projects are going to be something weird and wacky based on whatever I come up with at the time.

Ted was rugged up in a heavy jacket, gloves and a beanie. Earl was wearing a Secret Diguise Beanie (TM), a Secret Disguise Scarf (TM) and Secret Disguise Giraffe Hoof Mittens (TM) specially knitted by Rufus. Rufus sure was a man of many talents.

The <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/fandomhigh/408604.html"">post</a> will be open until Wednesday night if you want to jump in.

The following people need to hand in their ""Your Life As A Movie"" project:
Thomasina Coverly
<s>Jonathan Crane</s>
Lily Evans
Lane Kim
Rose Tyler
Sharon Valerii

Details are on the post linked above. If you hand it in during that post, you'll be graded as if you handed it in on time. If you wait until Thursday's class to hand it in, you won't be getting an A. Woe! If you don't hand it in this week, you fail. Double woe!

I know everyone has been busy, so this is just a reminder in case you've forgotten. It's the last music assignment before the exam (which will be given in class)."

"event","Yep, doing the poll thing. By answering, you are NOT committed to joining the class. I'm just looking for interest.

Notes:
1. If you have already taken Band you cannot take it again.
2. The Band class will have a new syllabus and more structure.
3. The Band class will be more about forming a proper, working contemporary band rather than just 'go practice'.
4. Music 201 has no prerequisites. (You did not have to take Music 101 to take this class)
5. If you did take Music 101, you can still take Music 201 because it's a different class altogether.

"event","After returning from his weekly shopping visit into town, Ted decided that tonight.. or today.. or whenever it was was going to be a good day. He'd lost track of time about three days ago when he overindulged in an excellent combination of Pop Rocks, Pepsi and Twinkies - all at once.

The procedure was a tricky one, but he managed to do some Twinkie surgery to cut the offending cake bar open, pour the pop rocks into the cream and mix it and then drop the entire thing into a big glass of Pepsi.

Ten Twinkie-Pepsi-Rocks later and there was nothing but a hyperactive sugar haze for Ted 'Theodore' Logan.

As a result, he needed a new guitar. Who knew that hyperactivity due to sugar could make you wear a guitar out in such a short period of time? Well, maybe not everyone could manage it, but Ted was a WYLD STALLYN and these things seemed to happen to Bill and Ted.

He made a mental note to check out and see if there was a place in town that sold musical instruments. Maybe the good folks at Championship Vinyl would know. He also made a mental note to check out one of the local bars. These days he was legal, and didn't have to travel back to the 1800s to get a beer without getting carded, but it was a good excuse to visit Billy the Kid.

By the time he reached the front door of his house, he'd completely forgotten all of his mental notes. No matter though, things always seemed to get done in the end.

Ted checked his mailbox and gasped in a most dramatic manner. ""Candy store!"" he exclaimed at the flyer. ""Opening! EXCELLENT!""

There was nothing as sacred as the relationship between a man and his sugar addiction.

Ted entered the house and closed the door behind him, safe and sound tucked away inside his house away from the sun. Man he hated that big glowy thing. Its brightness gave him a headache. But then, no one ever told Ted that it was a bad idea to look directly at the sun, and he really hadn't caught on to that fact yet."

Hi! You've reached the most triumphant voice mail of Ted 'Theodore' Logan. If you need to contact me, I'm probably at the Circle K or time travelling with my excellent friend Bill. So, uh, leave your name and your message after the tone and I'll get right back to you. Party on, dudes!

"event","This place is bogus, but, uh, in a good way. I wasn't too sure if Rufus was high when he said for me to come and do this teaching gig, but now I'm totally glad I did. I miss Bill, but he said he had to return Napoleon's Piggy Wiggy badge which he left behind. I wasn't too into Napoleon's France anyway.

I have a most triumphant music class ahead this week. Really Short Dude (<lj user=""bloody_rockgod"">) signed up to be my teaching assistant and Other Medieval Babe (<lj user=""___lily_evans_"">) called me 'Professor'. *grins* It was excellent.

But class is a few days away, so I found myself a bachelor pad off-campus. Totally awesome having my own place, and there's room for Bill if he decides to visit or stay a while. There's even a convenience store (sadly not a Circle K) down the road run by some guys in hockey jerseys. I was in there buying supplies for the week (Twinkies, soda, Cap'n Crunch and milk duds) and they warned me to keep an eye out for some drug dealers who hang outside the store. One of them doesn't talk and the other talks too much. Who knows? Maybe they'll be up for a party.

I wonder if there's, like, some rule for inviting students to parties or going to student parties. The teachers here don't seem like the partying type, but some of the little dudes and dudettes are awesome. I'll ask one of the teacher-type dudes tomorrow.


This is Ted 'Theodore' Logan, signing off.

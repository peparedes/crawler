"event","Comet came back. He fell off the wing of the Harpoon a few days ago and was still sore, so we sat on a bench this time. I realise dragging him round the grounds last week wasn't a great thing to do.

So we tried to talk and everything I said just made it worse. Every time I tried to be sympathetic it looked like I was prodding at him. Instead of being honest about wanting to go out with Sylvia because I thought he'd be upset I pretended the hospital wanted me to go with her because she was more responsible, being almost a member of staff, and that just made him feel bad so I had to admit I'd lied and that made things even worse. No wonder we fall out all the time if this is how we act around each other. It's the Albion incident all over again.

He said they all really miss me at Spirit and they want me home soon, and they can't run things as well without me. That's something, I suppose. No, it is, really.  I don't think I realised before that they really needed me there, whatever I wrote in here.

I asked if we understand each other now, and he said if we go on talking like this we're bound to catch up. So I pointed out that he's the one who needs to talk more. I mean he's admitted that his background was very military and you don't talk about things or have too many emotions if you can help it. I think Sutherland kind of had fun with him when they talked.

So in the end I admitted how much I actually care about the guys and espcially him. And I was worried I'd said too much and was embarrased but it was obviously okay because he put his arm around me. Then he had to go home but he's coming again next week."

"event","Saw Sutherland today. He wanted to talk about Sylvia, and about Comet of course. I feel bad now for being so hard on Comet. It's not really about him at all. He makes me feel inferior all the time by being so cheerful and well balanced despite all the accidents he keeps having. I don't want to think what state I'd be in if I'd lost a leg, as it is I haven't and I'm still in more of a mess than he is. What excuse to I have? 

So they're all right, I have been mean to him. I can see now I've often made him do the things he found hard, so I could see what a mess he was and now imperfect he was with the leg. I didn't even realised it at the time. 

And we mentioned him and Gail, I started wondering whether he talks to her about things he doesn't let the rest of us see ever. And I realised that most of the women I've been with were the ones who looked after me in some way. It always looked casual, but it wasn't really, not to me anyway. That's why I was hit so hard by Julia. That's another thing, I remember being sort of upset when Comet brought Gail along. Jealousy again I suppose, because it was just us men together and when one of you pairs off with a woman everyone starts to think they won't be the same guy anymore. But partly maybe I envied Comet, that he managed to settle down happily with a girl despite only having one leg, and so many scars and burns everywhere. I mean I don't even know if he can still perform. But I can't seem to have a normal relationship with a girl at all.

Sutherland asked me if I wanted a day away from the hospital sometime soon. Sylvia or someone can take me out for the day as long as they bring me back again.  I'll ask her on saturday. I should go with Comet, I know he'd want to, but I'd really like to spend a day with Sylvia away from here. If she'd be willing to take me that is."

"event","Comet came. He and Sutherland sure have it in for me. Comet's joining in with me exploiting the poor cripple and now I'm not sympathetic to him, boo hoo. He used to want not to be treated any differently than anyone else so now yhe's changed his story to go with what Sutherland said. We shouted and he stormed off. I was trying to show him round the grounds too, we went for a walk. I'm not sure I want to work with him anymore. He's more trouble than he's worth. He can damn well do air traffic control or something.  I don't want to think what him and Gail are saying behind my back.

Other than that? Boredom. I'm sick of this place and the crazies and having that stupid treatment. But I have another two weeks of it to go and they're not going to let me out before then. And can I still go back to Spirit if Comet and I aren't speaking? It's my company but it's partly his as well and I don't know if I can fire him. And Dex wouldn't like that and he's the only proper backer we've got now. I wonder if he's still going to come back next week."

"event","It was nice to see Sylvia again today. She couldn't stay long because she has so much to do at home, what with the store, and this stupid wedding coming up that she has to sew dresses for. She told me that although robot damage affected them in the first war, the years after the wars were the worst for her family. Her father got sick and the medical bill built up and they almost lost the store. She said it felt as though they were going through the struggle just when everyone else was finding their feet again. I said I knew exactly what she meant.

I told her what Sutherland had said and I said I was sorry again for being so mean to her when we first met. She said she didn't know me at home so she couldn't comment. But that If she was honest it had upset her a bit, because she never meant to be patronize anyone.

Then we went for a walk around the grounds and we held hands. She said Sutherland had told her there used to be a farm here when the hospital was first built. In those days they thought it was good for the patients to work on it and produce all thier own food. But ideas changed about about 20 years ago the state took the farmland back to build on. I said it would beat being locked up any day. He also told her that when it was built the patients all had their own rooms, actually rooms not just cells. She repeated the usual stuff about him being a good guy really and just having too many patients to deal with. I said he must get them confused sometimes and that's why he spouts some rubbish that doesn't seem to be about me at all.

I hope Comet comes to see me next week. I need to talk to him about it."

Look at the way I'm treating other people he said. So now it's all my fault. I know I was mean to Sylvia the first time she was here, maybe she said something. So now it's all my fault and nothing to do what happened in the wars at all. So much for coming here being the right thing to do."

"event","Suddenly I want to look at all the things I took from the house in Moravia. Everything's still in a chest at the base. I remember there being quite a few photos there. There was one of my parents before they were married that Sylvia would love. People still wore traditional dress for special occasions then in the smaller towns. A lot of them were taken after we moved into that house, though, after my father's buisness took off. 

I'd forgotten how much things changed for my parents, that they started a buisness too. I say they because although it was technically my dad's buisness, he couldn't have done it without my mother and she put in so much work herself. In that picture she looks so young, so old fashioned - sweet, I suppose someone here might say who didn't understand that type of life. But later on, once we had the money, she was always quite sophisticated. I remember once we were at some kind of event, my father was wearing a suit and my mother and older sisters had their best outfits on, and I was in my Air Force cadet uniform, even the younger ones looked so smart. And it was such a joke because a few years before we'd been living in that tiny little house and were always desperate for money, never had new anythings or even, decent second hand. And it meant even more to my parents and the older ones because they still remembered the old times before the great war, when we weren't an independant country. I don't remember it, I just always remember everyone talking about it. Like everything was bright and shiny and new, but there was always this shadow lurking in the background out of sight.

But that was what they did after the great war. It almost makes me ashamed when I look at what I did, but then I still have Spirit and there's still time to make it work. It makes me more impatient to get out of here. Everyone keeps telling me to take it slowly but it's hard being stuck here not doing anything. I owe it to everyone to make a success of Spirit, not just the others but my family as well. Marie always had a buisness mind, she'd make suggestions to father sometimes. She would have been really good at this. And probably could have done too, there were oppotunities for women in the new republic, before everything started to wrong.

Sometimes I start to wonder what they all think of me if they can see me like this. I know everyone would tell me that's not a healthy thought so I'm trying not to think about it."

I'd been trying not to think about it but it's true. After he'd gone I had to talk to Sutherland so as soon as I'd had dinner I made my way to his office.  Nobody tried to stop me for some reason, I doubt anyone noticed. I banged on the door but he had another patient in there, but he said he'd see me afterwards for a few minutes if it was really important. When I was in there I told him about what Comet said and he just smiled. He sat there smiling. Because we were coming to that next week, aparrently, but it looks like Comet did the job for him. I suppose that's a good thing. I'm so tired, I asked if I could sleep in a cell tonight as the corridor gets so noisy, but he said they're all full up. I can't even think of any of it properly now, I'm going to sleep (or try to)"

"event","Sylvia was here again and we sat outside together. For some reason I told her what Sutherland said and she says he's right. She had bags with her, she'd just been to the shop for fabric on her way in. Her sister's getting married to a man who's in the Navy and she's making the dress, and something to wear herself. I don't know, being around all these crazy people, it's nice in a way just hearing about ordinary people doing ordinary things. Reminds me there's a world out there, it's easy to forget sometimes.

And because she mentioned the Navy I told her about Franky Cook and how she introduced me to the Legion. And how I'd had Comet sent there and I thought I was doing the right thing but he thought I was trying to get rid of him. Then she basically repeated what Sutherland had said about that being the same as him sending me here. 

Then she asked me about Moravia. It's funny, I've never really talked about it much, only little snippets here and there. Sylvia said that when her parents talk about thier old country it's always a mix of happy and sad. I suppose it's the same, there are things I miss so much but there are things in America I couldn't do without now. I told her about the trip I made back to Moravia after the Legion broke up, how it should have made me feel better but it didn't. I think when I was there I realised I couldn't live there again. The pace of life is so different. In another situation it would be nice to visit, though. I don't know, when I went I was expecting too much maybe. Like, I thought all I needed to do was go there and everything would feel alright. And the memory of it is clouded because Julia was there with me, although she was so sweet at the time. When we were at war things were different and I always just felt like a guest, like I was only here to fight until things went back to normal, and since it's been over I still haven't been really sure sometimes where I belong. It's amazing how easy it is to talk to Sylvia about things. It's not like it is in Sutherland's office where I feel I'm being interrogated all the time."

"event","Sutherland said that the reason I'm not getting over my family is partly because I'm conflicted and I'm trying to see it in terms of heroes and villians when life isn't like that. He asked me how different it had feel if they had been working for us and Totenkopf had bombed the place. I told him I wished that had been what happened.

He said that in the real world, good people do bad things and bad people do good things and sometimes people end up on the side they don't believe in through no fault of there own and I just have to go on remembering that even if other people can't accept it or don't understand yet. 

It's not like I couldn't have worked it out myself but for some reason it took him to put it into words. I know I have to let go and stop trying to think of it as right or wrong. Nothing's black and white.

It's easier said than done but he said I have to deal with it in order to feel alright again. I suppose he's right, it'll be better in the long term.

I said it feels like letting the RAF boys off. He said that would only be wounding myself in the long run. He told me to put myself in thier place and imagine I had to destroy the factory. I don't want to think about that. that's why it's taken me so long to write this down, or write anything down. I'm getting used to the idea now anyway.

After we'd finished talking I went outside and lay on the grass and looked up at the towers. They remind me so much of the buildings in Moravia. When I went home the whole town was as it had been, apart from a bit of damage around where the factory had been and then an enormous wasteland of rubble and earth. A mass grave. It made me cry a lot thinking about it but nobody came and disturbed me.

I have to think it over a bit more."

I dreamed about them doing the micro needle thing in my tear ducts and I was crying, in the dream I mean, and I realised I was crying blood, and then I just screamed and woke myself up. I'd fallen alseep in the day room, it was really embarrasing. People tried to talk to me but I know why it happened. It's because I have to talk to Sutherland about the factory tomorrow. I don't know what good he thinks he can do. I went back to Moravia and looked at the factory site. I walked all round it and left flowers at the momument the town had stuck up there with the names on, and I went back to our old house and took everything I could. But I never look at the things I took from there. they let me have a leave of absence from Spirit because it was supposed to make me feel better, but it didn't stop it hurting. It's strange, when the treatment makes me forget things it's never the things I want to forget. They're always still there."

"event","The other day I got dragged up to Dr Sutherland's office again. He wanted to talk about my family. He knows about the factory for some reason. He's been trying to talk to me about it since I got here. I didn't  want to talk about it, I didn't need one more person going on about how it's a nesesary evil and how great the RAF are. He said it's alright if I'm not ready to talk about it but I have to deal with it at some time, maybe we could talk about it next week? 

Then he asked what else was bothering me at the moment and I let go about the place, the fact that it reminds me of Totenkopf and that other evil genius we had to deal with. About the fact that I'm always hungry and that the treatments are messing up my memory. I told him about the poem and the do-gooding girl who annoyed me so much. I yelled at him. I was expecting to get carted off in restraints back to the cell but I just didn't care by that time. 

But he didn't do anything. He just sat there and let me yell at him. Then he just repeated what he said last week. So many patients, so little time and money and the state not giving a half a shit or wanting to help, that kind of thing. I'm starting to think he's probably a nice guy really. And he said that Sylvia (the girl) isn't that type at all and if I did ever talk to her I might find I quite liked her. 

So I told him how frustrating it is, that every so often I have these moments where I feel as though I am getting better and that It'll be alright, and then I just go back to feeling as bad as I did before. He said I'm expecting too much too fast and I have another 5 weeks of treatments to go. So that gives me some kind of timeline. He said he'd already told me but I don't remember a lot of what he told me before I started treatments. They do want to help me, he said, and I should take it easy and let them instead of pushing everyone away. Also to spend time outside as it seemes to be doing me good.

Then yesterday, I saw the girl, Sylvia, again and I felt bad that I'd been so rude to her, so I went up to her and said I was sorry.  And she came to sit with me for a while. She finds it interesting coming here, if rather sad sometimes. I asked if she was just into crazy veterans or something, but I was only teasing her and we both laughed. She lives downtown not far from here,  her parents opened a store when they arrived here from Ireland before she was born and she works for them there and comes here when she has a day off. This place always facinated her since she was a little girl, with those towers and things. She has two younger sisters and two younger brothers. 

She wanted to know about me so I told her that I have my own Air Freight company. I didn't want to tell her that the woman I love betrayed me because it seemed like a sob story but somehow I ended up telling her the whole story of why I'm here. She seemed very interested in the Legion and the planes. She really wants to ride in a plane one one day.

It was nice to talk to her. She says she'll see me when she comes again."

Someone said there's a laboratory down there where they wait for people to die so they can mess with their brains. It reminds me of Totenkopf all the time.

"event","Yesterday when I spoke to that doctor he wanted to talk about Comet, so I told him everything, pretty much. I was expecting him to be awful about it and make Comet into the victim but actually he was very nice. He said that what Comet was doing was the same as what I did when I sent him to Albion, that it didn't seem like helping at the time but it would. It's strange because I never thought of it that way, even though I found I'd written earlier that it might be his revenge for Albion. I can't think of it as helping, though, and I said so. But the idea is the same, I can see that. He probably didn't want to hurt me. 

But it was still nice to see Comet and I miss him, and all the guys. He says he'll come again next week. I hope so. He's good to have around. I've been pretty mean to him really, looking at this book. And when I think about things from the past... He didn't deserve some of the things I've done and said, but he's always been a good friend and stuck by me and I've tried to do the same even if sometimes it didn't work out like it was supposed to.

He's always been the one to lighten things up and give me a laugh and cheer me up when I needed him too, and he sailed through everything ...I tend to forget I suppose that he has feelings too and he can be fragile just like the rest of us even if he doesn't show it the same way. I kind of always had a problem with him, that he went through some much and coped with it better than I did. But if he's right and the doctors are right and there is something wrong with me, well we're in the same place. Except that I might even get out of this one one piece and he's always going to be minus a leg. And if I never get back to normal - whatever that is - we're still in the same place. I'm glad we're still friends, because now I don't know what I'd do if he had just dumped me here."

"event","That doctor wanted to talk to me, about my treatment and things. He seems to think it's going well, that I'm calmer now. I suppose you could put it that way. He mentioned my ""agressive"" behavior the other day when someone took my book. I asked what the hell he expected. Then he went off on one of his own. Too many patients being brought in, the state not giving them enough money to handle it. I don't think he's any more sane than the patients are.

He also wanted to talk about the fact that I seemed ""agitated"" when Comet was here. News obviously gets around this place. So I just told him I was thinking about the needles and that after what happened in the last war I'll die if I get micro needles anywhere in my body, especially my brain. I said he could look at my medical record for the Legion if he wanted to know about it. Turns out he's already got it. He knows about what happened and yet he still let me think they might be going to stick micro needles in me again! He asked who told me about it, a member of staff or a patient. He said they only do it in extreme cases. What counts as extreme? He didn't say

He did say though that I'm getting my ground pass tomorrow. The grounds looked quite big from what I remember about arriving (which alright isn't very much) I might be able to write my book in peace again. Maybe next time Comet comes we can go outside. He hated those twitching, muttering people. 

Those treatments make me so hungry, I've been eating everything and then they actually give me seconds and I'm still hungry afterwards. The food here is horrible, but it's better than having to scavenge on the run. I've put on weight since arriving, which is probably a good thing as I didn't have much meat on with all that worry about the company losing money and everything. Maybe if I can go out one of the guys can bring me some supplies from Podzsky's and throw them over the wall to me or something. It's worth a try."

"event","Treatment they call it. I don't believe it at all. It's more like torture, like they want to break us until we behave ourselves. Having to wake up in that ward and find you've messed yourself, right in front of all those doctor's and nurses and a few people who don't even seem to be staff. It's humiliating. I feel sometimes like I'm back in the factory again. Slave labour. Sometimes I think I am there, my mind keeps wandering, sometimes I think I'm back somewhere I was in the past and sometimes I can't even remember how I got here. And then sometimes like now everything's clear. I don't like it. Maybe when they stop doing this to me things will be normal but in the ward I overhear things, people it isn't working on who have to move onto even stronger treatments and things. I can't get a real answer out of anyone. Maybe they think I'm stupid and I don't know what's going on. I didn't crack for Totenkopf and I won't crack for these people either. Maybe when Comet comes I can make him see how bad it is and he'll make them let me out. Though I can't imagine running a buisness somehow. I was fine when I came in and they're turning me into some kind of invalid. I have to find a way to resist it so they'll send me home."

"event","Bangs all over town last night, I thought the roof was coming down and so did everyone else but the sound of it but then I remembered the date and it made sense. I didn't scream this time though, but I did cry a bit. I looked at Comet's letter again, he and Gail seem so happy. I realised that I could get married too, I never really thought of it before with things being so open with Julia. When I get out I could meet a girl and get married too. It's strange to think that. I wonder if women feel different about a man who's been in a nuthouse, though. Maybe some of them wouldn't mind too much. I'm not the same as the others here though, I have my own air freight company. At least I think I have it. Comet sounded so sincere but I won't know until I've seen him. I'll write back and ask him to visit. They might put me back in the corridor soon as I haven't made a fuss, I've had more of those treatments and I just can't be bothered. I wonder if it's working, it's doing something but that can't be what it's meant to do, can it?"

"event","I had awful dreams last night. I was in the warbird trying to crash it again and Comet was down there on the runway and I was coming in towards him, aiming for him. He didn't have time to run and we crashed, it was on fire, and I got out, and Comet was there under the plane. His arms and legs were in funny positions and his good leg was almost off and there was blood everywhere, so much blood. And the smell of flesh burning, I could smell it so clearly. And I didn't feel glad that I'd killed him at all, I felt terrible. And then I remembered how Dex would feel and that Gail would be a widow now and so many other things. And it was too late to change it, he was dead. And the funny thing was that I also felt that I'd miss him so much and that there was no time now to make up for all the things we've done to each other. even after I woke up I thought that was what I had done which was why I was here. I can't describe how I felt when I realised I hadn't done anything of the sort and there was still time."

"event","They woke me up early and took me into a ward in another building and the doctor who was there talked about shock treatments. They weren't going to use electricity on me, he said. I was relieved but I'm not really sure what they did do, stuck a needle in my ass I think and I went out. When I woke up nothing made sense, it was worse than it is when you're really drunk or get hit on the head or something. But I recognised where I was in the end. I was so hungry though, I've never been so hungry even when I was on the run and hunting for scraps. Even now I can't stop thinking about the smoked pork and dumpings from Podzsky's. When I get out the first thing I'm gonna do is go in Podzsky's and order everything on the menu! I hope they're not going to do that to me too many times, it's not that it hurt, it was just horrible. I don't feel well at all."

"event","I can't bear being in this room any longer, I don't know what I'm going to do, it's as if it's closing in on me all the time, as if the walls are going to just come together and crush me so I can't breathe. There hardly seems to be any air in here. There's writing on the wall, real crazy stuff, and a load in other languages too. Just scratched into the paint. Looks like I'm the only one who had a pen. I can't bear what's in my head, without having to live with everyone else's madness all the time as well, I feel sometimes like everyone else who was even in this room is still here watching me. I don't even know why I'm here. Julia's the one who pretended to care and then sold me out, she's the one who should be locked up. I haven't done anything wrong. Nobody in my family supported Totenkopf or wanted him to win and yet they all had to die anyway, it isn't fair. Some of us did our best to fuck things up for him, I made every part defective and what happened? They took me out into the fucking woods to shoot me. And yet because someone doesn't do it or nobody found out if they were doing anything they're somehow evil. And everyone who never had a meglomaniac evil genius take control of thier town gets to sit back and look smug and pretend they would have been so different because they've never ever had to know what it's like. Because it's so easy for them to see whose a hero and who's a villain. None of us did anything wrong and yet we all still died or at least had to be unhappy for the rest of our lives. I bet Julia will just move onto the next man and make some more cash and move on again and wherever she goes she'll hurt people and she'll always get away with it because she can. That's the type she is. I can't bear that she did that after she'd always been so sweet to me, I don't want to believe it. Because it was never just the sex, it was that she believed in me and was willing to help me with the dream, or so I thought. I wonder if the Bomber Command lot ever thought that there were people in that thing. All numbers to them I suppose, never faces. I was thinking last night about the first time I saw a plane, when I didn't know what it was and I made Marie come into the garden and tell me about it. She'd just got married when the factory came, she was so happy. They probably all got medals for that raid, and what happened to the numbers? And what about the people left over? I think about what would have happened if I hadn't run when I did. I got to England, joined the RAF, shot a few robots, I was always so good at that because I knew where to get the tracking systems. Then the factory blew up. They didn't even know where it was until told them about it. Yeah I got away but everyone else died. And then what? I shot down a few more robots. I should have just let them shoot me in the woods there. That's a warning what happenes when you value yourself too highly or something, I don't know....."

"event","That doctor came back yet again, aparrently I start shock treatments soon. Fun! Shouldn't just kept my mouth shut. I fucking hate it when I think I'm alone and it turns out someone's watching me through that damn peephole like I'm an animal in a zoo or something. I tried to cover it over with the blanket but there was nothing to fix it with. I wonder what Julia's doing now. I'm still stunned in a way, I just don't understand it, I mean I knew she was corrupt but I always thought I was different, I never thought she'd do that to me. She supported the company all the way through, gave us money and she had a stake in it, why would she try and ruin it like that? I still keep half hoping it was all a mistake, but it wasn't because I heard it from her. It was probably my own fault, probably nobody else would have ever trusted her with their company. The signs were there, someone leaking things from the inside and I let myself suspect everyone except her. I wonder if she knows where I am or if she even cares. I almost wish she'd come here and explain and there'd turn out to be some explanation, but there won't be."

"event","Stupid bitch came in and took my pen. What did she think I was gonna do, stab her with it? I made a lot of noise which was probably wrong, but later the doctor who saw me the first day came and asked me questions, and I was calmer then so he gave it back. He had a look at the book too but he didn't understand any of it. Probably thought writing in this book keeps me quiet and out of trouble. So now it's like I'm a murderer as well. I'd love to know how that one works, I didn't even manage to kill myself so I'd hardly be much good at killing anyone else. Especially not with a PEN. Better be good or they'll take it away again. What's next, shoving an ice pick in my eye? I just hope the people who come to visit here are happy with themselves when they look around and see how their family or friends are being treated. I wonder if Comet and Joe and the rest have a clue what it's actually like in here. And he moaned about being sent to Albion for a while! When that doctor came in with the pen he mentioned that my ""friend"" Mr Haley had asked about me. Probably wanting to know when he can get the company turned over to him or something. I wonder what they said to him, probably that I'm doing ""fine"" or something. He should come and have a look for himself if he really cares that much, it would be a nice little field trip for him and Joe."

"event","There was a big storm last night. It needed it because it's been so hot but when it started I thought the building was being bombed. Crashes and flashes of light, and everyone seemed to be screaming. I realised I was screaming and yelling too, that I was soaked with sweat. All those planes and robots coming down on fire and you don't even think about it at the time. And the factory, I can see it so well even though I wasn't there, the machines were so huge, towering above the workers. There's no way anyone wouldn't just be crushed. But I think the raid happened at night so they'd be in the sleeping quarters. It was as cramped as this place, even if they'd had time to get out they would've crushed each other. I think sometime during the storm I was sick, because someone took me out and cleaned me up and when they took me back the sheet and blanket had been changed.  it's funny, I always hated storms in the Legion but I don't remember ever screaming or crying. But there was always another war to win or food to be shipped somewhere or something, in here there's nothing to distract myself with. It's all around me all the time. I can't hide anymore from the fact that I told the RAF where the factory was. I had to or they wouldn't have believed my story or let me fly with them. I'd already spent a week in prison while they made sure I wasn't a spy or something. I never really thought of them blowing it up, I don't know why, I was only thinking of the fighters and how I'd be flying with them soon. And then it was just hiding behind duty, like those shits at Bomber Command did. Trying to make out it's better to kill your own family if it helps you win. It doesn't matter if you kill hundreds of people on your own side who are victims of the enemy. It does matter. I'm sick of saying it was nesesary, maybe it was, it doesn't just make it magially alright or mean that nobody was hurt. The Brits just didn't understand that. I couldn't bear being there after it happened, with everyone knowing and acting so embarrased as if they didn't know what to say or weren't sure if I was an enemy now. Everything is so clear cut or black and white for them, just because they're an island and can't just be invaded across thier borders and don't know what it feels like to have the enemy living with them. Captain Franky can call me an over-emotional foriegner all she wants but they never had to fight for thier independance and then have it taken away and work 12 hours a day in some factory. And the Yanks are just as bad, the ones that are born here I mean. Just come to this country and everything will be alright. Don't they know that it just isn't that easy, how do you put something like that behind you and start again as if it never happened? How do you live with that? It's not like living with one leg or a few burn marks, where everyone can say your a hero and you got it for the cause. Nobody thinks you're crazy or shuts you in a room the size of a cupboard where you have nothing to do but remember it all the time. So Comet thinks I'm the same as him, that he can shove me into a hospital and get me fixed up and everything will be alright. Fuck him and everyone else."

"event","As soon as I get out of here I'm going to kill Comet, kill him! I mean it. He tricked me into coming here pretending he wanted to help me and that It'd do me good and by the time I saw what was happening it was too late, I tried to discharge myself but they weren't having it so I ended up in this room, or cell or whatever it's called. Though after the bed in the corridor it's a relief to be here, it's too dark but at least it's quieter. Hospital? they shouldn't be allowed to call it that. You come in perfectly sane and then go so mad you can never come out again. I bet half these loonys running around in here had nothing wrong when they came in. Everything's painted this sickly green colour that just makes me want to scream. So I get stuck in here maybe for the rest of my life and he gets the company. Not that it'll do him much good the shape it's in, and anyway he couldn't control a buisness if it was sitting at his feet and begging. I don't know why he'd do that, first he didn't want to have anything to do with it or fly with us, and now he's trying to blame me for Julia. Stupid bitch! I couldn't have known what she was doing, nobody ever expects someone who they love and who helped them will do something like that. Suddenly he wants the buisness to succeed and he wants to be in control when it does. It's funny that when I tried to help him he accused me of only doing it for my career. Then he decided I had been helping him after all and it all went back to normal. But maybe it didn't, maybe this is his way of getting back at me for having him join Franky. The ungrateful bastard even met his wife there! It just makes me so angry! After the meeting we shouted, of course, but then he was so calm and it really seemed like he cared. I let him convince me there was something wrong with me. I hate the bastard being so cheery and joking all the time despite having only one leg and more other injuried than I can remember. Why can't he just be messed up like everybody else? I hate these people who have to try and be heroic and happy all the time just so they can make the rest of us look bad. Good old brave Comet, losing a leg and only thinking about when he could fly again. Everyone else must be a coward or a whiner or be lacking in moral fibre or something. And then there's Joe, he probably thinks putting me away is the best thing Comet's ever done. Probably they're best buddies now. Joe's always been an asshole, the base was his own little country and he was the supreme ruler who couldn't stop trying to control anyone even for a minute to let them use their own judgment, which is what makes a hero a hero. Everything had to be his way and of course he could never ever be weak like us mortals, he always had to find someone to blame it on, it was always me or Comet or Polly or someone else who was spoiling his precious little plans, never his fault, ever. Maybe he's hoping to get a proper cut at the company now I'm not there. Dex pulled him into it but he obviously couldn't bear to be part of anything where he wasn't in charge, he couldn't just accept that he didn't have the legion anymore and it was time for him to take a back seat and a lower role. Maybe they planned all this, they might just have been looking for an excuse to get rid of me. Why did I end up with those three, all I wanted was to be successful and find somewhere I belonged. Maybe this is the place. I should have blown that warbird into the runway as hard as I could and let it burn."

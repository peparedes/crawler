"event","Tues, Read the Bible in Isaiah 35, 
    a scripture God has given me, I was truly 
    blessed by it. It has been a good day that the
    Lord has given me today.

         I praise the Lord, He has been so faithful
    and patient with me, I have been in a wilderness 
    for a while spiritualy, I am so thirsty for God
    to renew me and refill me with new and fresh
    annoiting. so i can carry the candlestick and
    shine for Jesus Christ, and be a witness for him.

        He has promised us, that those who hunger and
    thirst after righteousness, that we shall be 
    filled and refilled. sometimes God will test us 
    and see how much we long for him, when we can't 
    feel anything, like he is far off from us, but 
    really he has not left us at all, he is testing
    us to see how we want to feel his presence. He 
    will never leave or forsake us, by he will get 
    our attention, when we are being distracted from
    prayer and devotion time with Him. We must always
    make sure that God comes first in our life, and
    daily routine, So, when we start our day out, let
    us give him our devotion first and invite him 
    along to walk with you through the day.

         He will go before us and prepare the way.
    our path, and guide our steps. Have you invited 
    Jesus this morning ?   Is he riding along with
    where ever you go?  and did you ask him to take 
    the steering wheel to lead the way, He will 
    protect and give you the right directions 
    and wisdom too. :: Read The Holy Bible he
    has the manual to everything that you need,
    Proverbs 3: 5-9---Proverbs 2:1-13, Isaiah-
    66:5, Luke 8:1,  1st Timothy 2:1-4, 
    1st Timothy 4:8-16,Titus 1:9, Titus 2:1,
    Hebrews 4:12-16 and 1st Peter 1:21-23

        Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the
    Life....Seek Him ! 

       Thank you Lord, for teaching me, that i need 
     to keep my eyes on you, don't allow myself
     to become distracted from prayer and devotion
     time. I thirst for You Jesus.... I hunger for 
     You Jesus, and I want a closer walk with You..

        I am Blessed, I am Blessed, May i always 
      count my blessings one by one and see what the
      Lord has done. Psalms 103:

        If you don't know Jesus as your personal 
      Savior, Read John 3:16 and seek him NOW!
      He will come and save you, and bless your life
      too.... Joy unspeakable and full of Glory!!!
      I promise you, You can have this peace too.
      Invite Him in your heart and life today.

"event","TODAY:   We had a beauitiful sunny day, and we
         had refreshing cool breeze, I started 
         out the day, with a devotion from
         crosswalk, and asked the Lord to let me
         Be a blessing to the students, at 
         our christian school, 
         
         The students started their day, with 
         a devotion and prayer, as we began the
         ministry of teaching the students
         everyday,with every subject they are
         given scriptures, to learn and memorize.

         
         
         
             Students are finishing all  their tests of school
             year.It is a honor in helping them 
             to have a true relationship with God
             Teaching them how to serve God in truth.
             This is my third year, in ministry of
             helping with the school...

         What a blessing to do a work in the 
         harvest, of God's vineyard.
         I pray that everyone of those students
         relize how blessed they are to be in
         a christian school, with teachers who
         care about their future.  
         And that they have the seed planted 
         in their hearts. When these students go
         out and become fruitful and produce faithful
         commitments that bless their life.

         No, matter what challenges that may face they
         are equipped for what ever comes..
         
         
         For those student who cannot return
         next year, because that they have 
         move or go to another school, My prayer
         Is that someday, they will allow those
         things which they have been taught,will
         stay planted in their hearts and that they
         will be a sower themselves someday, in
         God's vineyard.. This is what I pray.....
                 
              Thank God our Lord Jesus Christ,

         When trials arrive
         The winds will surely blow.
         But, be strong in the Lord
         Then your faith will grow.

         In Jesus we can stand tall
         Above all the rest.
         Let him walk you through the valley
         And guide all your steps.

         When you are in the valley of dispair
         Always know and understand this
         Jesus knows and he cares. 
         This place called valleys
         don't always have to cause fear
         When it's cold darkness fills the air
         He knows where you are 
         Because,he loves you,and cares.

         Blessings beyond measure
         That this world can't hold
         He lays up many treasures
         Worth more than silver or gold.

         He will give you peace
         And make you whole
         I came to know him
         He saved my soul..."

But in my searching I came across the most hilarious blog debate on the show. I've had similar discussions the show in the recent past.  
I just can't get that damn song outta my head! I think it speaks to my present state of mind.

 I've always been in love in the fall. it smells good. Makes me reminisent.  
  
I just wanna lay in the sun naked and, let my body feel the ocean, and rain forest scented breezes kiss my skin. I wanna let my body feel alive with the cold air and warm sun. That's when you can truly feel lifes energy."

I love it! it's so me! 
It was my first internet purchase. I bought it on a whim and I definitely don't regret it!

This pic was taken while flying the kite and, waiting for Orcas, on whale sex beach A.K.A. Beautiful beach near Sointula on Malcolm Island!

This a pic taken of the view of Vancouver Island from the trail leading to the beach! Sointula is finnish for utopia and I can see the beauty and the hope that the first settlers must have seen and felt when they first founded this place.

Wow I can't beleive that its  been almost a full year since I last posted an entry!  Wow time flys.  Its also crazy how much has changed and how much is the same since I last posted. 

I can't beleive I'm still working at this job.  I must say that I think this job is one of the most interesting, dangerous and boring jobs all at the same once ... Man the stuff I've seen!  It's changed me! and I'm not sure if its for the better.  I've started smoking again and I can't quit the dirty habit, I drink way too much, and I'm getting plumper by the minute.
 The food we eat out there is soo rich and soo much of it it's like Christmas day every day! bacon eggs, toast, potatoes and pancakes etc. for breakfast and usually a huge roast with all the fixins for dinner well I guess the guys need it with no sleep and tons of manual labour, they have to replenish some how. I shouldn't eat all that cause I'm usually only counting fish,and doing paperwork. I love it when the weathers nice and I actualy feel as though I can truly work the deck. Its the only time you feel apart of the team.

 I can't wait till the summer, the winter is a terrible mistress she's been kicking the daylights out of us. It's been blowing non stop it; feels like. I haven't been getting much work between the weather and the three flu's I've suffered through.  BAH!   Its hard not to get sick when your on a 60foot boat, at sea for seven days with guys who are sick! YUCK!


I really have been trying hard to stay at this job but I feel at the end of my rope. Having only worked for a year and a half and already I don't have many people with more seniority above me as far as observers go. Maybe 10...tops!  Most people don't make it past there first trip especially if they get sea sick (which I do almost every trip! but I'm tough)Yeah the turn over rate in this job is huge; outta the last class there were 11 newbies, and now only four are left. The class only came out in January... bad time to start if you ask me! weather sucks!

Its a hard life, your gone for days if not weeks at sea with no way of really contacting anyone you know or love.(hell I spent 25 days in November without touching land!) The crews are allowed to use the SAT. phone, but there is no internet. The boats don't let us loley observers; the scourge of the earth as some put it, use the phones unless its and extreme emergency. That part of the job is hard; the boats harbour a lot of animosity towards us because we essentially are spys, reporting them if they step outta line; plus they have to live with us, find a bunk for us and feed us. You can see it almost kills some of them to even be nice to you.  though I must say that most of them understand that its a job  and someone has to do it. But its hard living with that. Every boat has something bad to say about us, the program, DFO, or our peers. You always feel like an outsider or stranger. lots of the guys don't even bother to learn your name so you'll go a week without hearing your name, I never realized how beautiful it could be to hear someone say your name. After my first trip like that, where no one used my name I almost cryed when I heard it ... I'm serious. I didn't think being called by your name was a big thing till now.

I've been on 23 different boats in the last year and a half. Crazy!  The boat I spent five weeks (not back to back) The Ocean Selector; It burnt and sunk in harbour in Vancouver about a month ago!  I have to admit I cheered ... The weird part is the night before it burned I was trash talking the boat to a few of the new observers ... saying I thought it belonged at the bottom and that they should have left it there last time it sank etc.  I wake up and voila the boat is burning ..... I wish I was there with some marshmallows!  It's starting to get scary though with the burning of that boat... those guys were lucky they were in harbour and not at sea, they would have all died. I could have been out on that hog at sea when it caught fire ... I don't even like to think about that. Than two weeks ago a girlfriend and fellow observer was at sea, asleep at 5am and all of a sudden the engine room was on fire! Smoke billowing throught the whole boat. I'm glad they got back safe. Shes pretty shook up about that. I guess almost dying can do that to you.  Than last week another Observer friend of mine was at sea and the stabalizer beam broke right off the boat. they were lucky they didn't roll.  That boat is bad for stuff breaking, I almost died twice on that bitch!  first time was when the double broke and I almost kissed 60lbs of steel and than I was on there and both bridels broke.  I felt a peice of wire fly past my lip.  I just can't help thinking that something is going to go wrong out there to me or one of my friends. A boat hasn't gone down in while, all the fishermen say it coming time for another one.  On this last trip one of the guys heard on the radio that his Brother in law and Nephews were in some trouble up off the Charoletts, a wave hit and blew out all the window's in the boat and killed all there navigational devices. Scary!  he was worried cause you don't know whats really going on till its all over.

 The men out where I live are all associated with fishing, logging, or tree planting.  All transient lifestyles and all lifesytles where your the master of your own fate, it seems to make people a little werid/wild and selfserving. All the men want is a one night stand; And if you actually commit she better be hot if she's your girlfriend.. ( I use the term ""commit"" loosly because I can't think of one fisherman who is loyal to his wife!) its worse than highschool.  than theres the gossip, fishermen are worse than 15 year old girls.  Trust me I know I've worked with both *rolls eyes* 
I've had a lover for the past 9 months but thats weird too, gotta keep it a secret and we see other people ... It makes sense that we see other people we usually don't see each other for months and when we do its only for a coulple of days than were back to sea again and as far as keeeping it a secret I understand that to because we work together; well we do the same job. But I don't think thats what I want, but thats all I have for now.  I keep getting hurt and I can't seem to walk away. I know I care more about him than he does me ... and he lies.  I don't know whats wrong with me that I can't just walk I guess it that I'm just soo lonely!
I think the worst part of the job is the lonelyness. I've been single now since October or November of 2005.  Its getting to the point where the lonelyness is almost painfull I can actually feel it in my chest... Its awful."

I have never ever felt loneliness like this, ever! I think it's the worst part of the job. I've been single now since October or November of 2005. Even Shannon hasn't been able to find anyone. With my job and the type of people we usually meet up here it seems almost impossible to meet a decent guy who's gunna be around and who's going to understand the nature of my job! Hell I meet tons of guys; but it's like the advertisement for that new Anne Haysh(I don't know how to spell her name!) Show ""Men in Trees"", ""The pickings are good but the pickings are odd.""  I find that funny cause that show is filmed out here and its sooo true.  Its getting to the point where the loneliness is almost painful I can actually feel it in my chest... Its awful."

 The men out where I live are all associated with fishing, logging, or tree planting.  All transient lifestyles and all lifestyles where your the master of your own fate, it seems to make people a little weird/wild and self-serving. All the men want is a one night stand; And if you actually commit she better be hot if she's your girlfriend.. ( I use the term ""commit"" loosely because I can't think of one fisherman who is loyal to his wife!) its worse than high-school.  Than there's the gossip, fishermen are worse than 15 year old girls.  Trust me I know I've worked with both *rolls eyes* 

I've had a lover for the past 9 months but that's weird too, gotta keep it a secret and we see other people ... It makes sense that we see other people we usually don't see each other for months and when we do its only for a couple of days than were back to sea again and as far as keeping it a secret I understand that to because we work together; well we do the same job. But I don't think that's what I want, but thats all I have for now. He's quite a bit older than me, 12years and he's been doing this job for 8 ... so he's crazy! It's like he has some macho player rep he must live up to or the guys at sea won't think he's as cool or someting ... I don't know!  All I know is that I keep getting hurt and I can't seem to walk away. I know I care more about him than he does me ... and he lies.  I don't know whats wrong with me that I can't just walk! I'm just soo lonely!

I have never ever felt loneliness like this, ever! I think it's the worst part of the job. I've been single now since October or November of 2005. Even Shannon hasn't been able to find anyone. With my job and the type of people we usually meet up here it seems almost impossible to meet a decent guy who's gunna be around and who's going to understand the nature of my job! Hell I meet tons of guys; but it's like the advertisement for that new Anne Haysh(I don't know how to spell her name!) Show ""Men in Trees"", ""The pickings are good but the pickings are odd.""  I find that funny cause that show is filmed out here and its sooo true.  

Its getting to the point where the loneliness is  painful I can actually feel it in my chest... Its awful."

I think the last entry on here was a little seasonally depressive things are deffinately looking up I'm traveling more and getting out on my days off experiencing the island not just hiding from the unrelenting rain.  Im in Prince Rupert working out of this port for a while.  I like it although The police did come and visit the night before last about a noise complaint... It was only me and the Polish guys (aka the polish fish mafia LOL all jokes!) we were just on the deck having a smoke now and than throught the evening and volia la'policia!

"event","The last few weeks have been the shits!
first I have to take the week before the fisheries year ends off because I had to move Shannon and I ... Alone!!!! (she got a sweet 12 day trip and I only got 4 day... bad for the pocket book)Bad news is I'm now fourth on the list and started at 8th and the week after April first no boats go out till they figure out what they're doing with the trips for the year, so I've been sitting on land for two weeks... lucky I've been able to work a few days tagging Halibut which brings in some cash! 
On top of everything I got sick before I had to move and I also had a problem shelling out all the cash for the first months rent moving expenses and sheer work of moving all that stuff. Plus I had no one to help and no truck. Man its amazing what we've accumulated in the four months since we moved in! To be honest Shannon had the most stuff it was so frustrating. 

But on the positive side of things I really learned how great people I've meet are!  My friend Billy helped me sooo much he stayed an extra two days when he could have gone home, just to help me move ... he even got into trouble because he stayed( ... so much drama lately!) he also took care of me the whole week because I had 0 dollars due to shelling out my very last dime plus borrowing just so I could get into the apartment so I could move while I had someone to help.  The job is so unpredictable and you neve know when your going to be going out or who you will see when sometimes you see someone for months and than you may never see them again its really weird that way! 
So the move was sucessful and Shannon landed on April 1st at 3pm just in time to collect the security deposit and clean the stove :) Which was awesome! It was really lonely moving by myself after Billy left.  I was also partying a lot while trying to move which left me with a MASIVE hangovers and after last friday a still lingering feeling of embarrassment and fatigue. So one triumph accomplished Yahoo!

two days ago my car got hit in the parking lot at the new apartment.  I didn't realize that it got hit till yesterday because I'm not really driving it right now because the plates  expired in December and the brakes need to be done plus I have to change it over under BC! *takes deep breath*
anyways so the worst part is that we think we actually saw it happen!  Shannon was sitting in the living room watching TV when we both heard a crunch, she looked out the window and she saw someone peeling out of the parking space next to mine she said she thought someone hit my car but we looked from the balcony and everything looked fine STUPID!!!!! So now I can't even open my gas tank up and its scratched from the just before the gas tank all the way up the drivers side door to the mirror!  just what I needed when I have no cash and am getting pretty bitter about that too!

and on top of everything that drunken friday night I ended up making out with one of my colleagues on the dance floor at the ""club"" out here and it was nothing we were just dancing and having fun,  TOOOO DRUNK!  and this guy is awesome really good looking, very smart, hot, tall, etc dall dark and dreamy around my age... really everything you could want in a ""friend"" but I just wasn't into him ... I thought I could be but I have a bigger problem than that. 

 I think I may have more than just friendly feelings towards a good friend out here. That's bad .... really bad!  

firstly he's 42! has a kid, he's a colleague, and to be honest not my usual type; he's very skinny and to be honest he's like a big kid.  he drinks a lot and there is suspicion he likes his drugs. He has a rep of being full of shit and even  promiscuous. I know he's been with unsavory women and is most likely unreliable that way; But we get along soo well and there is a definite connection there.  There has been talk about me bunking with him (well an invite and a hint or two)  But he sends out such mixed signals... he flirts and says dirty things but never makes a move.  Than sometimes he says things to make me think he likes me ...Than he says something to casterate the relationship ... right down to calling be one of his kids/sister(that was when I was hanging out with other guys... he seemed a little peeved that I was giving them as much attention as I was) But if I try to neuter the relationship he almost gets sad!  I enjoy the sexual tension between us and the fun of flirting but now I think about him when he's not here and I wanna talk to him and mostly I want to kiss him. 
perhaps i'm not liking him the way I think I do! it's probably that we just get along well and like to flirt.  I don't want to make any moves to give him any ego boosts or for fear of ruining the friendship we have .... because honestly I don't want a relationship with him I really just want to sleep with him and continue to be his friend.  Man I'm soo messed up with relationships/lust/friendships!"

I made $1000 dollars in January *OUCH* and due to complications with my last job and my failing memeory I was unable to get EI as of yet... its in the works and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
  So I've learned what real friends are and what a great socal net work I've established up here.  Food and drink are never an issue as my friends and I all get together and combine the ingredients from our often sparse cubbards, and pool all of our food and drink together to have an incrediable nights...We drink a lot. Meat is often not an issue as you can catch fresh crab, fish and clams right off the docks/beaches. 

I have to admit that my lifestyle since coming to the coast has not been the healthiest!  before hitting the road in August I was ""near Vegan"" an avid juicer, neve drank beer and had finally gotten ahold of my cursing issue due to my job. Now I'm an avid curser and enjoyer of meat and beer and I have no juicer!  I'm soo happy though, freedom rocks. The scenery out here is amazing... I just looked over my shoulder right now and I'm surrounded by the snow capped mountians from the main land, I'm watching boats coming in and dropping off their product .... Its amazing.  I guess I've hit the end of my road right now ...LOL!!  Literaly they call Port Hardy the end of the Road because the major highway ends in the Ocean right in downtown(well main street) but I think that it's more beautiful than most of the Island up here Victoria is nice but the further north you go on the island the more beautiful it gets.

 This is the bay that I'm looking out at right now!!!

 The last two weeks of February were awesome. Diane came down and Shannon and I, made the seven hour drive to Victoria to pick her up from the airport.  I love driving down Island, it was so nice to see cities and people! not to mention the scenery it was crazy beautiful.

 We partied and pa-roused the city of Victoria for a couple of days;  I think Shannon and I needed the time outta the sticks more than we had imagined.  We introduced Diane to some west coast staples while in Victoria, like Oyster bars and fresh caught fish (The kind that were actually caught on some of the boats that I was/have been on) and of course Noodle Box (Mmmmm how I love thee Noodle Box!) Oh Yeah and FLOYDS the undisputed ""BREAKFAST CHAMPIONS"" I've traveled a bit and I've eaten out for breakfast a bit more, and I tell you FLOYDS is the best EVER!!!! (I'm making myself hungry I have to stop talking about it!)  

We eventually made out way back to beautiful Port Hardy by way of the west coast stopping along the way in Tofino and Uclulet visiting friends and co-workers, sightseeing and drinking and laughing our way up the coast. Once we got to Hardy we introduced Diane to Lucky Beer, Fresh Sushi( better than anything back home)Indian candy, smoked salmon, sablefish, clams, beach combing.  We tried to go clam digging but my crazy friend Paul gave us these wild directions that looked as if we were to at some turn off exit to another galaxy. Needless to say we didn't even get to bury our tongs into the beach. 

The trip was everything I needed, I spent cash I didn't really have but it was all worth while. Here are some pictures of my trip .

Just can't wait till I get on a boat again!!!!

Well I've been on land since my last post!  Yepers a pretty long Christmas holiday thats for sure!  Well Actually I went out last Thurs. to collect some brood stock for a native aquaculture; but alas the trip fell short. By the time we got to the fishing grounds we had to turn around and come home the waters were going to be too rough to bring the ""babies"" home. The guys on the boat were all native and they were by far one of the best crews yet! The worst part of this is that I was sooo sea sick the entire time! I think it was the worst I've been sick yet; and I don't know why!!!  ahhh well it's probably because I haven't been out for a long time!  Soooo I'm supposed to head out again on this boat tonight and fish tomorrow it will only be a one day trip but I must admit I'm scared I feel like I haven't been out for soo long!!   

I'm going a little stir crazy this town! This town is smaller than Lindsay. It makes Lindsay feel like a metropolis... Though we do have an A$W (where you wait 20min for you dinner!)

As well living in this small little town isn't doing anything for my social and/or romantic life!! ArGGG!!  I have of this week decided to give up completely on the thought of finding a romantic partner (.) I was thinking a lover would be grrreat but alas I don't think its what I want anymore!  never amounts to much more that some good experiences ...  and I think I wanna settle down and possibly breed (LOL yes breed *I crack myself UP!!*)  
Ahh well I'm going to spend this time building on myself more!  I'm becoming very well read and I have mastered my new and super snazzy phone!

Yesterday was fun! Except that my boat landed at aobut 1:30am just as the power in Hardy went out, and on the night when both the cab companies were shut down due to not having enough drivers. So alas I had to stay on the stinkin boat Bah!!!  I spent my birthday on the blasted boat and was sea sick the entire three days YUCK!  Not that I don't usually puke on my birthday but usually cause I'm having too much fun...Ahhh well.  
When I got to the port house in the morning my friend Isabelle was still here and we hung out all day and yicked about everything wilst trying to stay warm. Damn electric heat and no electricity.  Jen and Nathan dropped by and all of a sudden there was a bunch of us with nothing better to do than eat all the icecream and other perishables outta the fidge. It was fun.  
This year is weird, it didn't feel like my birthday even happened and it really doesn't feel like Christmas is coming either ahhh well I'm not a big christmas fan, but I really am trying this year. You see my friends Jen and Nathan are huge Christmas people and there both a little down this year cause they can't go home and there broke and Nathan hates living in Port Hardy!!!  So my mission today is to get them a tree!  or something I don't know how I'm going to do it but I need to bring them some christmas cheer.  well I bid you adeau I'm off to spread holliday cheer!

Or at least showed me that I'm not really in the party mode these days.  I'm fighting the overwhelming urge to head to the bush, with all the beautiful landscapes to see, I can barely sit here long enough to get on the next boat. I'm sending my family home real ""West Island"" staples LOL! I'm going  to send them some of the clams, we I so laboriously dug and had a friend can (well there really in a jar; there great for soup) than I'm having my neighbor get some indian candy made out of a salmon that was given to me, and the drink of the west coast LUCKY!  LUCKY seems to be the brew of choice out here on the island.
As far as LUCKY goes, I don't really know if its a good beer and frankly I don't care. I haven't drank beer since I was about 18, I hated it! would not drink it.... yeah things change; I'm loving it right now LUCKY and I had a fun night last night; though the majhitos may have had a hand in it.  I noticed last night that the drunken stupidity of people really drives me crazy I no longer have the patience to deal.  Especially when I'm seeing all these people who live to get drunk and hang out at bars, pouring out their life stories.  It makes me sad and I guess I equate that with the party lifestyles. Seems lonely.

I'm supposed to head out tomorrow on a boat that I've already been on and was sick the whole time, partially weather partially the damn boat.  The crew was cool last time so lets hope history repeats itself.  The seas are rough and a lot of fishermen are coming in and closing down shop for Christmas.  Which kinda sucks because between the bad weather and the season its hard to get work and your happy when it comes whenever that may be.  I'm a representative for my colleagues observing and I was supposed to attend a meeting in Victoria this week but I held out for a boat instead.  I feel bad because I wanted to go to the meeting but I had to make sure I had work starting over costs a lot :) I'll just have to work more on this end to improve communications between the office and the observers from this end.  I have a few wicked ideas that I'm putting into the works.  Its weird some of my ideas are a direct result of my last job ... I definately gained some tools from that experience.

 I have a great group of friends out here both from work and outside now Its wonderful.  The people I'm meeting seem to be real quality people who would do anything for you its amazing. I still haven't met anybody that I would like to date its weird, maybe I'm getting to picky in my old age LOL!  Its just to hard with this job anyway.  I'd never see my mate unless he lived in Hardy or if he was an observer.  An observer ... I think that could be worse. I'm content right now to just make friends and adventures, but I guess that eternal need to find someone is always nagging at the back of everybody's head no matter whats going on in your life,  if you don't have a mate your always kinda looking or yearning for one.  I guess being single for over a year now probably has something to do with this preoccupation with finding a relationship.

Ahhhhh my rambling fingers.... I haven't been sleeping much lately and I've had a lot of time to think..... I can't wait to get back on a boat and be sooooo freaking tired I don't have time to think."

I still can't get over how nice the people out here, We've made some great friends had some good experiences and some bad but man is it ever making me.

Why am I not even an option.  I kinda dig this guy and i know he's not into me that way because it appears that he's into the little girls (short thin) but we get along so well.

Ahhh I think that I've just had too much time the think about everything!   I""m feeling very second rate.  The old fishermen out here dig me but they dig anything!!!  I've been told I'm like a good friend or like a sister to them it sucks its like high school.  
ahh well I'll wine more latter LOL</b>"

I think the after glow is starting to wear off and reality is setting in. I'm both happy and sad that the shine is coming off the newness of this experience.   My face was really starting to hurt from all the smiling :P.   

I'm starting to feel the presure of finding a place, I really need somewhere to lay my head on a consistant basis.  Not to mention I would really like to stop living outta my car .. though there are some perks to having all of your worldly belongings with you all the time. I just can't find anything.

There are sooo many things I wanna write about.  I just worry about confidentiality of it all.  For the risk of my own actions as well as with what goes on on the boats.   

I really have to say that I do miss being close to a city center,  I'm pretty bored today and I just wanna do something fun ... It rains all the time in Port Hardy which is cool but man it just exasterbates the bordom. On a positve note I'm gettin more well read by the day!  I'm probably soo bored cause I was supposed to be on a boat last night at 20:00 but it got delayed( not that the skipper called to tell me that) than they wanted me to board this morning at 6am which means that I was there at 5:30am (did I mention that no one on bored was awake)  only to sit around till 7am to be told that they were delaying due to weather( well due to me telling my dozy skipper that no other boats were leaving....  Knock Knock I don't know shit about weather or boats ) anyhow I""m on stand by till tomorrow than who knows the weather is really bad on the water.  I was out in 5meter waves the other day... kinda thought it was cool.  I should go to sleep I went to bed at 1am and was awake at 4:30 soo I'm starting to feel a little beat.

anyway I'm off to find SOMETHING!!!!  to do!   I'm stuck in port with grandma so partying is out of the question lol sorry G-ma.</b>"

I hear there a gruff bunch and I'm excited for the challenge.  

Trying to figure out where we're going to live has been a huge challenge for us but I think we have it figured out!!!  Small town living is just not going to work for Shannon and I as our personalities are too big and our will to do all things we shouldn't may effect us negatively...LOL *shakes head*

I'll be on land again in seven days (the 11th) at which point I'll be landing in Ucluelet(which is a far way way from my car and all my worldly belongings) I'll than be heading back to Hardy to pick up my vehicle and than heading to Nanimo to rent a place ... I'm really excited!!!   I'll be glad to have a place to put all my stuff and relax and perhaps check out the night life....  I sniker to myself cause I know that for a while our place will look like a flop house cause we have NOTHING to put in it ... I'm going to have to buy an air mattress LOL!!  I LOVE IT!   Ghetto styles!!!

I just wanted to put out there that my cell number has not changed so if anybody would like to call me thats the way to do it! 905-809-3550  I'll probably be changing it over to a BC number soon but I don't know when that could happen.  

Mr Matt I hear you may be around the area at that time, feel free to call or drop a line I'd love to see yah!!"

"event","<b>So I have a chance now to actually update my Journal Yah!!!
After induring a intense three week course in Victoria I was shipped off to a little place called Port Hardy, which is about seven hours north of Victoria. Anyway my experience is barely setting in. 

It took seven days across canada only to arrive in Victoria late Sunday evening to have to start class at eight the next day.  So three gruling and awsome weeks later I graduated, my class and in true graduating form went out to celebrate ""STUPID"" what I negated to mention is that I was booked to leave for Hardy the next day!!!!!   I'll tell you that when you drink your ass off with the bosses till six AM and than attempt to drive seven hours with a killer headache let me tell you I thought I was going to die... seriously!  
Arrive in Hardy,  the next morning I get the hail that I have my first boat .... it leaves at 4pm!!! AHHHHHH I've barely been breifed and all my worldly possesions are stowed in my car in the fashion of anyperson who has packed quickly and half drunk still, I didn't know where anything was ""CRAZY""  
My first boat was called the Carmanah No.1    
I must take this time to say that the crew were not all too friendly I'll tell you, well except for one guy he was new too and hasn't yet developed the rest of the crew's hatred of ""spies"" or the enemy as they refer to us.  So my entire trip I was known as ""Observer girl"".  Well as far as first days/weeks on the job goes this has to be the worst.... I was sea sick the entire first day, the second day I had yet to develop my sea leggs and fell into the stove which was a desiel stove so it's never really off and I aquired third degree burns across my knuckles.  Well that was just the start of it all on top of this being a pretty overwhelming job to start with most of the guys not really happy to have one of us on board and than the work and the hours etc... well you get the point it was rough.  My second day mother nature decided to suprise me with and unexpected friend for which I was not prepared (sorry boys but Its all apart of my horrible experience!!) and on top of that the crew wern't really talking to me too much.... welll except for this young guy he was my saving grace.  By the third day I was ready to scream and than .... they used my name.  Weird eh!  perked my whole day up!!  it was like hearing music.  Than I slipped in a load of turbut and landed in a sampling basket and almost killed myself LOL!  

I found out later that this my first boat was on one of the more/most undesirable mySkipper is rumored to be a bit pshycho and the crew are known to be jerks  LOL figures!  well Idid it and by the time the trip was done I was loving it!!!!    I love adversity, challenge and confrontation!!!   :)

Luckly my last trip was amazing... besides the fact that my burns got infected ....  The crew rocked more about that next entry  :)


I tried to write this fast so I'm not respoonsible for any spelling mistakes :)  </b>"

Lisa and Anne-Marie galloped into Oshawa on Friday night like two beautuful ladies on a silver focus. They rescued me from my pouty fate, and wisked me off to North Bay.Lisa's cottage was soo freaking Beautiful!!! I couldn't stop smiling the whole time. My cheeks hurt.  I can honestly say that this is one of the best times I've had alllll summer! and for who knows before that!

"event","<b> Crazy day!
Well whats crazy is that I woke up at 4am BAH!  I had to go to one of those sleep clinic thingy's where people watch you sleep whilst you are hooked up to a hundred electrodes that are attached to every part of your head + your hands and legs. Not a comfy experience.  I wake up lately at 5am, but usually go back to sleep.  No chance of that happening last night! I think I pissed the tech off though ... guess I move a lot in my sleep. LOL!
Than it was off to another Dr. appt at 8am to have a biopsy done on a suspicious mole Ewwww!  The Dr. dermal punched my hand... I got mine though it really weirded him out when I watched almost the whole procedure... why is that weird I wanted to see what it all looked like! *shrugs*
I feel as though I'm chained to my computer as of late thought cause I spent the rest of this beautiful day completeing resume's.  I found a few jobs that I suit.  One job is as a cook at the Algonquin Eco-Lodge as chef. Sounds like fun but it only runs from july 24 till mid October!!! ah well I need something new!  and I think I would love it.  
Thursday I'm going to go out for the whole day and enjoy the sun. Maybe even tan this milk white body of mine.  Necked sun bathing by the pool may be the plan.  I miss hanging out naked... what ever happened to that? </b>"

- Okay, so I missed EIP, but I read somewhere that the gaang was staying at Zuko's old house on Ember Island, so thanks for your concern, but I do understand what's going on. XD
- Zuko telling Aang to ""roar"" while they were training. XD
- Katara: What's going on?!
  Sokka: It's Zuko! He's gone crazy. He destroyed my sculpture!...oh, and he's attacking Aang.
- I love how Sokka addresses the gaang. ""Air! (Aang) Water! (Katara) Earth! (Toph) Fire! (Zuko) Sword and fan! (himself and Suki)"" Hmm, Sword and Fan would make a nice nickname for Sokki, dontcha think?
- Zuko was included in a gaang hug! HIP HIP, HOORAY!
- Is it me, or does Toph have a crush on a certain firebender? ;D C'mon, y'all were thinking it. TOKO FTW!
- Katara: Guys, guess what?
  Toph: I knew it! You have something with Haru, don't you?

I love the gaang's reactions to that. XD

- I loved it when Sokka thought Appa ate Momo and he climbed in Appa's mouth.
  Zuko: Sokka, get out of that bison's mouth!
- JUN IS BACK! And she made yet another Zutara reference! 8D
- Quoteth <lj user=wohitzi>: ""Sokka and Suki sleep side-by-side, Zuko and Katara sleep side-by-side... I think I'm looking into these things too much. xD"" 
- The White Lotus Society is made up of awesome mentors from before: Iroh, Bumi, Piandao, Jeong-Jeong, and Pakku!
- Speaking of which, Pakku/Kana is canon, baby! So that makes two ships for me. 
- It was awesome how Bumi took back his city. I love this guy. :'D
- We also get to see the past Avatars again. I really love 'em.
- C'mon, guys, admit y'all got emotional when Iroh and Zuko hugged. Seeing them cry got me. ;_;
- How come you picked Katara to help attack Azula, Zuko? *winkwinknudgenudge*
- Azula and her insanity. I felt so bad for her...I mean, we've seen her as a power-hungry beeyotch before, but you still just wanna hug her. It was sad when she cried after Katara tied her up. But that fight with Zuko was awesome.
- Speaking of which, I loved it when Zuko took that bolt for Katara. I know, I know, he did that 'cause she's a friend, and, of course, he doesn't want her to get hurt. Let this fangirl dream, plz~
- The fight we have all been waiting for: Aang vs. Ozai! Even if Aang spirit-bended, I'm loving this. It was pretty epic. Sorry I can't be more coherent than that. -_-
- I love Ty Lee as a Kyoshi warrior. I really do. <3
- The Maiko! Normally, I don't care for this ship, but I thought it was pretty sweet. (Many people must hate me now. :|) I forgot what she said after the kiss, but I thought it was funny.
- So, did Ty Lee and Toph let go of their Sokka crushing? Just wondering....
- I love how Zuko was helping Iroh out at the tea shop.
- LOL at that painting Sokka made. I think I love Katara the best out of that that. 
  Katara: What are those on my head?
  Sokka: They're you hair loopies!
Anyone else miss them? D:
- Mai: ""I look like a man.""
I'm sure everyone at <lj user=maisaman> is happy right now. XD
- The Kataang kiss? I'm okay with it. Really. It was pretty sweet, and after all the suffering they went through, as least Aang got his wish.

But I do take GreenifyME's ""Revealing Destiny"" as canon in my mind. Maybe this is why I'm so calm. XD</lj-cut>"

Thanks to this video tutorial about inking with Pigma Micron pens, I understand what I'm doing ""wrong"" whilst doing my linearts. First off, the pen I got, an 005 .2 fineliner, is too freakin' THIN. It's usually used for stuff like detailing eyes and hair. Also, I always press hard on the pen and ink slowly; it doesn't give off the effect I want it to give.  Third, I barely give my lines definition, which I should do; it'd make it look less flat and more three-dimensional. 

So yeah, thank you so much Steven Sanchez! (That's the guy who created the video.)"

"event","Today on Ovation TV (a channel for the arts), I saw an animated film entitled <i>The Triplets of Belleville</i>. It was pretty good. There's almost no dialouge except for a few scenes, and even then, some of it was in French -- without English subtitles or anything. I thought that was pretty cool. <3

The animation has the appearance of some of those retro cartoons from the '30's, which was also pretty cool. The plot? From wikipedia:

""Following a 1930s-style cartoon parody featuring the singing Triplettes of the title (Violette, Blanche, and Rose, whose names are loosely patterned on the colours of the French flag) in their heyday, as well as caricatures of Django Reinhardt, Glenn Gould, Josephine Baker, Yvette Horner, Charles de Gaulle and Fred Astaire, the story focuses on Madame Souza, an elderly woman raising her orphaned grandson Champion.

Seeking to pull him out of his funk, she buys the child a tricycle, and as the years pass he achieves such excellence as a cyclist that he enters the Tour de France. Unfortunately he and two other riders are kidnapped and brought to a fictional metropolis called Belleville (the inhabitants of Belleville represent caricatured 1950s-era American stereotypes, but the city itself is portrayed as a cross between Paris, Montreal and New York City) where a gangster forces them to pedal all day on a bicycle-based gambling machine located in the bowels of the Belleville French Wine Center. With the aid of the family dog Bruno, Madame Souza sets off on a paddle boat journey to the city of Belleville. There she meets the Triplettes, now aged and decrepit but still performing, and the four women set out to rescue Madame Souza's grandson.""

Definitely worth a watch. :D

I also saw Spirited Away, which I hadn't seen in a looong time (2004 or something?). It's a week full of animation, and tomorrow they're going to give Tokyo Godfathers, a film I've heard a lot of praise for. On Wednesday, they're giving a documentary on one of Mickey Mouse's artists, and on Thursday, they're giving an odd adaption of Dante's Inferno, which seems interesting. Can't wait to see all this stuff."

Anyways, they feel like crayons. They blend well, and the colors are bold and bright...but it's the good kind of bright, not the kind that looks like you colored with a highlighter. (?)

I'm using it to color a piccy of Misa I'm drawing (a character from Death Note). The next thing on my list of art things to buy is a scanner, so I hope I'll get to show you it soon, 'cause a digital camera (a <i>cheap</i> digital camera) can only get you so far.

My summer, to those who are concerned, is kinda boring. But at least I've been drawing more! I'm working on my coloring and shading. I really have improved. :D

And I finally joined Drunkduck.com (a webcomics hosting site). I don't know when I'll finally submit this story I've been thinking of for months; it needs to be when I improve both drawing-wise and writing-wise. So, maybe in a year or so? I also hope to get one of those programs that'll help with screentoning. Maybe the Letraset Digitone project.

Speaking of Dad, I'm worried. He and Mom went to the clinic to check to see if he's got a problem, because he has said over and over again that he's been having lots and lots of pain. Mom said that he may even have to go to the hospital. I hope he'll be all right. He may be a douche, but he's still my dad, and I love him. Plus, he's not ALL that bad. I mean, there are times he's friendly with us and everything. I just wish there was a way to make his bad side go away...

But back to Gravi! If I said Shuichi was cute, then Ryuichi is 100x cuter! I loved when he was drawing his picture in episode 13. ""Car goes ZOOOOM!"" X3 I love his rabbit costume and plush. (Why's it called Mr. Bear? I hear that's just a dub thing, but I'm still curious.)

I'm happy about the anime ending. Now I have to read the manga and the manga's sequel. How will I do all this? The world may never know.

I'm sad that Ozai, Azula, and Iroh didn't die. Well, okay, I guess I'm happy the last one was saved, but still, I wanted some epic death scenes! Then again, they do get punished badly, so whatev.

Man, I really am a lonely loser. Well, I guess it's like that cause of the selective mutism and all. Gotta deal with it, Mirta.

But anyways, there was something really sweet during first period. There's this boy in my class who's disliked by nearly all the students, for reasons I can't understand. He's actually okay; he's not a meanie or anything. So I heard in sixth grade, he had a crush on me. Although I did feel bad for him, I wasn't interested, so I didn't do anything.

Then this new girl transferred to our class a few weeks back. Due to some circumstances, she became a pariah too. The two outcasts started hanging out together. They played ball and chattered with each other. An idea was stirring in my mind. <i>'Those two would make such a cute couple....</i>

And whaddya know. When we were returning to class, they were walking in front of me, HOLDING HANDS. I about squealed. Ah, the hell with it: SQUEEEE~!

I seriously thought of some my favorite pairings playing that out. Like Katara seeing Aang and Toph holding hands, or Sakura seeing Naruto and Hinata together. Hmm, I should use that in a fanfic....

I can't travel alone, and I don't have friends that I'd hang out with...unless they'd let me. Let's see what happens.

I'm just sad I'm done with it.

But I still have to check out the anime. Rats.

I tried to check New Moon (the book that comes after Twilight), but it wasn't available in our school library. So I've got to either check the regular ol' one in town, or buy it. And I know I'll never achieve the latter, so if that's the only option...well, rats again.

I'm writing fanfics! But don't think too much about them. I bet I'll just disappoint people. I'm what you call...a procrastinator, so if I say I'll do something, it may take months, days if you're lucky.

Sokka: My first girlfriend turned into the moon.

Zuko: That's rough, buddy.

Zuko: I'm never happy.

And that whole ""silver sandwich"" thing. XD My, Zuko's really changed. Recently, I rewatched ""Siege of the North"" (both parts) and was annoyed at Zuko's...villain-ness. XD But look at him now, trying to be optimistic and trying to be like Iroh--failing miserably at the latter. XP

Suki (to Zuko): Actually, we've met. You, uh, tried to burn down my village.
Zuko: Oh yeah...Well, it's nice to see you again.

I feel kinda sad, though. See, a few days ago,  a closed box was on the yard of the church next door. (Yes, there's a church right next to us. O_O) The owner of the church was going to drive right over it, but curiosity drove that desire out; instead, he decided to check what was even in it. So he opened it a crack and out popped...a puppy!

Yes, a young puppy, a female pitbull, just abandoned in a box. There was a Ziploc bag full of puppy chow that came with it, so I know this was all planned. She was probably left out and lonely. Makes me wanna cry.

Anyway, we let her stay with us overnight until we can hand her over to Mom's friend, who wanted her. We nicknamed her ""Mimi"". She had such pretty green eyes, and I think she may have grown attached to me. (Which always happens with me and dogs for some reason.) She also smelled like fried chicken, which was kinda disturbing; made me think someone was trying to cook her or something. O_O

Anyway, it was when I was in school the next day that they gave her to Vanessa. I know she'll take good care of her; she took a lone dog she found on the beach to her home, and she still lives with him. I just miss little Mimi. I hope I can see her again. ;3;

In other news, there's gonna be an art show soon. We have to submit our pieces by next Wednesday for it. I hope I can make a purdy picture, one that'll actually make it into the show AND will impress anyone. ^^ 

Speaking of art, today (as well as yesterday) we were watching this inspiring documentary entitled ""Highwaymen"", describing the careers of these African American painters in the late 1950's. Since they wouldn't allow non-Whites to showcase their art in a gallery at the time, they had to sell their's on the street (hence being called ""highwaymen""). They did all this to help support their family, not to mention they just loved painting. They had beautiful ones, too, with serene scenes and big, bold skies, with pretty colors. They make me feel like working on a project right now. ^^

Tomorrow, we'll start painting again, this time on landscapes. Most of the other times we've painted, I never really worked hard, always using the ""I hate painting!"" excuse. But now, I can't wait to do it again. I'm gonna try to work hard too, and not give up so easily."

"event","Ahh. It's thanksgiving. The only thing i like about it is that we have no school. All i get to do is sit around and watch people eat thier faces off with some dead bird. On top of that. This is the one day of the year my grand parents get thier way and we have to say grace. For the gods sake, if the thing's&nbsp;all powerfull, can't you say it to yourself, later? It can hear you anyway, right. And why would it care. Your eating. You do that every day. If whatever god realy does exist listend to every freakin one they couldn't be all powerful because their scedual is being controlled by people yapping thier mouths about why thier thankful to god because the people went out and got a job, and worked hard for the money. To buy food, and gas, to drive all the way to a relitives house. But of course it was all because of god, not because the worked thier asses off for it. And by the way, Anna, and Paige. I can cuss if i want to. It's my life, not yours. I can say what i want, it's a free country. Sorry but thats the way i feel right now anyway. *sigh* ok now that thats all out, i'm feeling less irate. Sorry for snapping at you guys. ok. i'm gonna go back to bed. There's nothing for me to do today anyway. And i'm slightly happy at the length of this journal. Wow, i must have realy been venting."

"event","Crap. I was certainly going to write a long entry. Don't yell at me, but it was going to be rambling about why i'm mad at some people. Unfortunately I procrastinated too long and now I have no bad feelings twards them any more. Sucks to be one of you huh? Hahahahahaha. Ahh that was nice. Ok whatever. So i'm afraid you'll all have to wait for another time. Or get me pissed. Whatever. I'm feeling realy tired right now so i'm crashing. I know it's only 9:18 but these drugs get be soooooooo tired. Hey what do you know. This is my longest entry to date. Well you got your wish. Bye."

Ahh the blood that we'll show, somehow the teacher loves it. We're going to include a lot of iraq too. I think this will be my own persional way of getting back at bush for being such an ass hole."

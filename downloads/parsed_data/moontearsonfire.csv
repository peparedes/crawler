"event","well i told kephin that me and david are talking again. kephin started to get all mad because i will change and become a different person. what the hell? i have no intentions on trying to change who i am for david. ugh hes so angry at me because i talk to david. get the fuck over it there really isnt much u can say to make me not talk to him so quit trying shit head. ugh he pisses me off. me and david have an understanding about things and kephin just doesnt believe that. ugh it makes me so mad. 

i told stephen i liked him, and he told me he liked me to but we've only hung out once so nothing is going to become of it and im still not over kephin i liked him alot and its gunna take like a month to actually stop since i've liked him practically since may. lately i have talked to kephin about stephen and i've told him i like him alot more then i like stephen and hes said he liked that. but what i dont like is that he said he still has feelings for me but he isnt doing nething with them. hes like sitting there letting them rot. 

now i know i told him i'd take him back in a heartbeat if he realized he wanted to be with me to be happy, but lately i have been thinking about what it would be like if he did want me back. i duhno i dont wanna go back to what i had before with his mind. i want him to be completely shure on what he wants insted of just going with the flow. i dont want to get with him and then in  a month like usual he wants to be alone again. it would be to much for me to deal with. and ugh i duhno so many thoughts are going through my head about this. i need to stop spillin them out."

"event","after reading what kephin had written, it upsets me because when we talked last night he basically said ""lets not touch/talk to each other for a few days and then i should be better"" but now hes saying hes gunna use that time to see if he really wants to break up with me? thats cheap. he said hes afraid to lose the amy he has now, the one where he hugs and kisses and can sleep next to at night and talk to about personal problems and hit and what not, he wants to lose 4/5 stuff cause he wants to be alone cause he is more upbeat alone. why do i even bother putting up with this? i told him yesturday i saw in him a confused little boy who doesnt know what he wants out of a relationship and thats why he changes himself all the damn time. he said i was right. i duhno if its just me thinking to much but it seems like if he really wanted me, then he wouldn't want to change to figure out what he really wants. im holding back what i say because although i have some really good points to help him figure out if he wants to break up with me, i do not want to be the one to persue him. 

all i know is yesturday he was saying one thing, and then in his blog hes saying something different. well kephin, if ur gunna pull this shit and say one thing to me and then another thing later, fuck it, i dont want to be with u either."

"event","so yea, today i heard some kinda disturbing news from melanie. but i mean its not like i was expecting this, and like i was thinking about it for a while now, just havent taken the chance. well, kephin was thinking about breaking up with me because i duhno i guess he wanted to be alone...? i knew he was thinking this and im prob boreing him again. egh oh well, i was thinking the same thing because he wants things that i dont outta a relationship, like he doesnt like the thought of talking to each other alot and spending time with each other alot, he likes the space-ness. i duhno i love to cuddle and love every second i can take, and he just doesnt, he has to be in the mood to do that. i duhno i think its kinda retarted, i've tried my best to try and give him the things hes wanted, like i've even told my self to not be all lovey dovey in school because he doesnt like it. i duhno i just wish we would compromise more then what we had. he is/was one of the best things that ever happened to me. im not sad, but im bummbed that now im losing one of the best things i have had in like years. he syas he wants to leave me because he wants to be ""alone"" and not ""reliable"" to neone. when buzzell was telling me that he said he was so happy to be with me just yesturday and now he changes his mind like this? i duhno, my reason for wanting to end this can be fixed, his on the other hand can not. and he doesnt want to dump me because he thinks im not going to talk to him, and he still wants to be close and have a good relationship and tell me things as he did before. dammnit! why do i always have to be right? i knew this was going to happen and yet i still let it procceed w/out caution. now all i can think about is the other girl he had a thing for. and it was just monday night that he told me not to worry because it was a small crush and that if it ever turned into a big attraction like what we had then he'd tell me. how can that change in two days? oh i know! maybe he l...i...e...d! 

kephin i need to tell u this, if u wanna dump me go to it. i dont want u to lead me on thinking u want to be with me when u really dont because u wanna be ""single"" and prob flirt with that fucking chick u said u didnt fucking like as much as me. what the fuck ever. i will talk to you, and i will still be ur friend, but if u screw me over and have told me shit not fucking true then i will not, and the last time this came up and i told u i will not fucking talk to you is because i still believe/and thought that u were going to dump me for a fucked up reason that shouldn't have been toyed with in the first fucking place..can u tell im kinda mad? im not as mad as i have been in the past, but decently annoyed i should say..yessss annoyed would be the perfect thing to say. 

i wanna stay together and make this work, i really do, but i have no say in what u feel so if ur gunna dump me do it today, dont waste another day please."

"event","so this weekend was eventful for the most part. amanda, melanie, kephin, koski, shauna, and christine slept over. we did a ouiji board that katie had brought over earlier. that shit is weird. it didnt really interest me that much at the beginning, but i duhno if i see peolpe having fun---then i get the craveing to do it also and i want to jump in, which i did. we got around 10 people to respond to us, some of them are foregin and we didnt talk to them really after we asked if they speaked english (cause they didnt lol). then there was this one guy and we were like is there neone there? and then they went to ""good bye"" lol it was funny. we got this ten year old black boy that was a slave and was killed. we feel bad, and we want to be his friend and he seems to take a liking to kephin because he hugged him lol. theres this guy terrance (who we used to call edgar) that wants melanie and buzzell...but mostly melanie and will only do things if melanie is there, like she was partcipating in it this one tme we were talking to him and he was coperating with us so melanie put her hand on it and was like ""cut the shit!"" and then he spelt out ""yay"". lol it was so funny. he hates kephin also and hes a dick...shyep..he hates me too, no idea why but he does. YAY steve likes to sleep with me, kephin, and koski at night, awww its so cute...

neways, we later did the card fortunes i know how to do, i did them to kephin and buzzell. buzzell was kinda happy with the results, and ya know we were all having a good time and then after kephin does his first one it comes up saying there are problems and then the next one he did he said he choose someone else and it said that it was a perfect relationship. i duhno after that he started acting shitty and we knoe something is wrong and we make him come back up and play more with us. then i did some more ones and everything was fine again. i duhno theres something hes hiding from me. i wonder if he likes someone else? and wants to be with someone else? i duhno if the second is a no and the first one is a yes i wish he would just tell me so i won't get suspicious. and hmm i think i have an idea of who...what ever. im not getting my hopes up for us lasting a long time neways, because i know him and i know what he does and i know what he thinks and he doesnt stay iwth people for long because he gets bored, i just hope that doesnt happen with me again and what not. egh oh well."

"event","so yep, i think im jumping into things. i think im jumping to conclusions. 

have u ever thought that maybe sumone would love you so much to never wanna leave ur side? yea i thought that once and then everything fell apart. after i surronded my world around him it fell apart. i duhno i guess im afraid of that happening again. 

but it is also hard when i know what and how kephin thinks. but im glad i do. i dont want to get into that foolish thought of everything is perfect in my little world and nothing can go wrong yet. well i knoe thats not true. and i dont want to be the same girlfriend i was when i was with my old boyfriends, i've learned from that and i want to try to be one of the best girlfriends kephin has ever had.

there is something else that has been urking me. 
kephin i know how u think ur only ni high school and u wont be with the same girl through the whole thing, so ur like hey i like u, u like me, lets get together and have some fun. yes dont try to say taht its not true because i remember u telling me that on the phone. u know i dont believe you when u say ""luv ya"". cause its a common thing to say and u dont mean it the way i want u to mean it. like i duhno, theres just something about the words ""luv ya"" that has only a friendship meaning behind it, it doesnt make me actually think that u really do love me and want to be with me for as long as possible. u said so urself u didnt know how long we would last. ""i love you""...its just something about it that makes me like man he truelly means it and really does love me. now i know ur not useing me for sexual things, trust me i know. and i must admit there are times when i actually do think u really mean it, but what u have said in the past just haunts me and gets me to stop thinking that interelly (spelling?). i duhno. im sorry if this made u mad at all. but i know that im still not trying to get attached to you in fear of this all ending."

im still mad at my cousin tara for giving my old journals out to my mom. egh i hate her so much for it. i know shes trying to look out for my mom, but thats NO REASON what so ever to go through my shit and my thoughts to try and get dirt on me about her. and now my mom hates me for telling lies about her in there, when in reality none of it is lies, but shes to trapped in her little world to understand it at all. and she wants to be known as the good gal, well mom i hate to break it to you but ur not."

We had this really cool lesson and I learned a lot which was good, I just didnt have the answers to any of the questions. So my new goal is to become less of a squasher and more of an uplifter!! I need help so yall keep me accountable cus i am quite the squasher- haha sorry lizzie you know i love you tons!! Oh and something else fun happened tonight: I got this top secret thing that Jason made me!! hahahaha it was really funny when i opened it cus there was this hot hot picture of me and shelbey where we looked totally messed up. And thanks to Jason, I will be reminded of that all the time!! YAY...so anyway i hope everyone had a good day and we can make it through two more long days of school ughh!!

"event","I hate when you know you should cry but no tears come out, there is no emotion to show the hurt you feel inside. That is exactly how i feel right now and it is depressing. I have had to face family issues this week- and the saddest part is it has happened to another family this week. It is really making me think about stuff. I cant even decide how i feel: relieved, angry, sad, depressed, indifferent, numb...I cant decide whether to cry or yell, hit someone or lay there helpless and hopeless. Im just so confused and it makes it worse that every time i come home my mom and my sister have a talk about my parents. Why cant our family be like it was 6 years ago, why am i finally realizing the gist of what happened 6 months ago, and why am i in this family? is there an answer or reason to any of those? Maybe i am here to help others who are going through the same thing? i dont know...what i do know is i want to thank shelbey and harris and any others for listening to me bitch for hours.

In Him,
taylor

"event","This weekend was quite fun! It was a bonding experience with Shelbey- she and I are crazy when we get together...

So Friday night she came over and we watched ""Garden State"". Great movie but i swear the director was on drugs. There were some parts that were sooo freakin random but it was hilarious and so cute at the end. Awwww. Haha it was really funny. There is this scene where she does something random in a spot- haha we def. did it and shelbs broke it down in the living room. It was awesome! Yah so then we also got our chick flick for the night when we watched ""The Prince and Me"". SOOO cute. I love it even though i have seen it many times. Best line: "" i dont know if Denmark is ready for a princess like me.... well theyre going to have to be because i am!!!!"" Aww. good times. And then we made out with the pillow- haha not really....or maybe! Girl talk til 2 AM, it was wonderful!!

So saturday was fun. I forgot what i did. huh. Oh, that night i went to go see ""In Good Company"" with some people. That movie is sooo cute. Everyone should see it.

Church was fun today. Just me and Shelbs basically in the service which was fun when we had to sing. We both suck and cant read- its sad. After church Shelbey and I went to Qdoba and other stores. Yum yum- good food except i could seriously do weights with my burrito. Crazy! Im tired of typing so Im going to stop but i had an awesome weekend with you shelbs!! repeat sooon...more family and boy talk!! haha we can start planning the trip! YES!!

Peace and Love,

The exam wasnt bad and i got an A but then we got ready to leave and I took out my cell phone and the security lady took it. OMG i am sooo mad. I didnt even realize she was right there and it was just so stupid of me. Ughh. So anyway I think I get it back in a week supposedly but she didnt even write down my name so who knows. The only redeeming thing about this AM was when my sister realized the gates to school were shut so she rode over the sidewalk to leave- it was really funny. It will be soo weird without a cell phone- so sad to say but its true for me!

I hope everyone had a good day,

"event","hello everyone! i havent really updated in a while because nothing fun has really happened to me except for the past few days... 

On Friday night i went to hang out with paige and shelbey (the hottest man alive) and we watched Wimbledon! that is such a cute movie. I think i am becoming obsessed with chick flix though. now all i need is a mark darcy and a peter colt mixed together haha. We also did other fun- but not the least bit dorky things- like playing word whiz. that is the reason shlebs is going to go to duke or UNC- she plays nerd games like that. haha u know im kidding. 

So Saturday night was freakin AWESOME. Songs for Sudan rocked my sox off and we had the best time ever. Shelbs and i pretended we were at the headbangers ball- which is the reason my neck is sore today. so sad. I also got a pic (guitar thing but not too sure how you spell it) from this guy in 100 Yorktown! I was soo pumped. it was a blast. oh and i forgot to mention that i got the best news i have ever received in my life!! well close at least...

Then this AM was the feast of lights. It was really funny to see Mike as Joseph and Shelbs as a man. I couldnt stop laughing. And props to lizzie on a wonderful job pretending to be an angel-it was quite a stretch for her as we all know. haha. 

until next time- love to everyone!!

"event","Wow. What a ski trip. I hate to say it, but it was a lot less awkward and a lot more fun than i imagined. Leigh, my dad's gf was really funny and nice-and reminded me of my mom. I hate to say that though because in a way i feel as though i am betraying my mom. On the ride up Ans and i were debating how we should act- sort of as a joke- and we thought Parent Trap behavior would be funny, but that didnt really happen. The skii trip ended up being quite fun: here's a briefing...

On the ride up, i was the ""Navigator""- a noble title my mom gave me to insure that i stay awake. So, navigation isnt quite a forte of mine and we got lost- and hour and a half detour is what i affectionally call it. Surprisingly, Ans wasnt too pissed- compared to the normal beating i would receive for such an act. The total time for the ride up: 8 hours. Ride back: 7 hours. Thats 15 freakin hours of driving. Whoo!

My skiing was quite humorous. Ans found it entertaining and would go to the bottom first and then laugh at me as i went down the slopes at the pace of a turtle. I wouldnt consider myself a ""skilled"" skiier, I am merely skilled at getting down the mountain in one piece. So Leighs daughter was in ski school, and the rest of the talented skiiers were left to ski together. My family loves the blacks and blues, while i am quite content sticking to the greens and an occational blue. But i was soo proud of myself: I skiied down four blacks- well i skiied down three, tumbled down the other one on my ass. But nevertheless, i felt quite accomplished. 

I never knew skiing was such a workout though. I woke up this AM after getting back around 1:30 and am feeling some serious soreness. Huh- thats sad. So anyway i hope everyone has a wonderful and safe New Years Eve!!! Dont get too crazy ;)

lots of love- tay

ps. lizzie congrats on dumping hector- finally!! now you can move on to better someones...;). also- be proud of me-i remembered The BOOK and did it nightly. HAHa- YES!!!!!!!!"

The grandparents were here, my mom's of course. My grandma(Mimi also called Mimes) is quite a character. It always is fun to have her in the house but she can get soo irritating so more than once I have shut myself in my room and just sat there to get away! I had a fun Christmas Eve- we always go to church and then have like 10 families from church over for a party...a fun tradition. Christmas day was good- just got a lot of stuff.

But now I am going to bed so I will be able to wake up at the crack of dawn- 8 AM- to go skiing with an interesting crew: my dad, his gf, her daughter, my brother,sister, and me. hmmm- that will make for an interesting entry!

"event","Last night was sooo much fun. Lizzie, Paige, Shelbey, Blair and I decided to have a Bridget Jones night where we would watch the first one and then go and see the second one. So on the ride over there at like 5, my mom was giving me this very momish lecture on how ""not all girls are like that and i dont have to sleep with anyone to get a guy like Colin (Darcy is MINE shelbey...hands OFF)"". So i got the lecture and as i started watching the movie i realized how much i am like her. I mean i consume the same amount of alcohol units, sleep with my boss... im kidding for those who dont know me too well. But it really was weird, we had a LOT of stuf in common. So the movie at Liz's got us soo hiper and we were running around playing Karote and Down by the Banks- a fun camp game. ""its bulldocks blair""...""NO, its not. Its bulldogs"" haha i love you blair. So then we went in the Pimpstress mobile down to arboretum to see the second one. It was wonderful. Extremely good movies if you havent seen them. There are awesome lines such as ""Quite pervy really"" and ""daft cow"" and ""i was laboring under a false apprehension"". 

Here's the thing, they are such date movies though. We were all so in need of someone after the movies it was absolutley insane. I was out of my mind but we arent going to go there (mating calls: but i do have standards!hahaha). So we went back home (good thing tommy was already asleep- haha im joking) and made hot chocolate. Shelbey and i discussed our sexual frustration for a LONG time- there was lots to be said. We had a nice talk- love you shelbs. At like 12 we went upstairs and Shelbs and I did the model walk- i am soo good. We had so much fun- who cares if the neighbors saw us dancing!! So me and shelbs snuggled in Liz's bed which was fun. Then they started scaring me with this movie preview we saw and i was seriously spassing out. It scared the crap out of me. So all four girls, since blair left, were snuggled in lizzies double bed. It was crazy- but what happens in the bed stays in the bed. Great times with all of you- i love you so much.

"event","Lets start with Friday...I went to an awesome lockin- it was SSOOOOOOOOOO much fun. We just had a blast singing and playing and gazing at stars! It was funny, when i got there i was bouncing off the walls i was soo excited then by like 5 in the AM i was pooped. It was soo much fun seeing Aaron and getting to hang out with Shelbey, Blair, Hoppe, Sam, Goober, Paige, and others... 

So Saturday was a little rough. Although I wasnt a member of the ""insomniac club""- 5 was plenty late for me. So i came home slept three hours, went to bake pies at Urban Ministries which was quite fun, and then came home and slept three more hours. That night i went to a ""Panther's Party"" only to watch them lose. Sad. 

So sunday morning I was a bum. I skipped church which i havent done in forever and slept until like 12:30. It was wonderful but i felt bad that i didnt go to church- a little guilty. Then at like 12 i went Xmas shopping with my dad and brother...not too fun. Too much testosterone and my brother kept farting. That wasnt too fun considering my dad and brother are like obsessed with each other and i was just like standing there uncomfortably. Oh well. So i got my mom a little present and got Ans hers. She is so picky and i finally found the necklace she was talking about and paid way too much for her present. I love her, but that hunkin necklace was an investment. If she doesnt let me wear it i will be really pissed. So tonight i am going  babysiting- i need money desperately after today. But gues what was so exciting: i looked in one of my jackets and found $53!!!!! how cool is that? 

Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend and for those loosers up in Gboro and Raleigh- have fun at school this week. Aha aaron!!

And then today was just as pointless at school but I was so happy to get out I could scream!!

So tonight my sister got home from cheerleading and there was an envelope from her dream school regarding her admissions. Princeton is her #1 choice and she doesn't even have a #2. She's really smart but everyone knows it is nearly impossible to get in there. So, anyway, the letter was thin and it was so sad. All hell broke loose in our hose. Even though she only got deferred she was soo upset and started bawling really loudly. I hate those situations when you have no idea what to say so you're just like ""its ok, everything will work out. Its not as bad as it could be."" I felt like shit for her. Our house was loud and crazy so I was soo excited to leave.

So Brian and Nacy's mom had planned this get together for all the Happening people at Christ Church and Saint Johns. It was such a blast. We went and had ice cream at South Park and hung out. It only ended up being like 6 of us -which was cool- since loosers like Blair didnt come. Lizzie and I found this awesome store in the mall entitled Club Libby Lu. WOW!! I have never seen so much pink, fur, and glitter. It was a little girls dream and it was soo cool to explore. I felt like I was five again and in Limited Too, but it was much cooler. There were stations to make body glitter, fur pink chairs, pink phones and many more fun stuff. Lizzie and I had a ball while Shelbey looked embarrassed for us. What can I say, I wish I was a five year old girl again. Anyway, it was soooo much fun. Especailly when it was freezing outside and it took me and Lizzie and Shelbey a year to find her car....brrr

Random thought: Christmas is the only time of year when I actually REALLY want a boyfriend. Its sort of depressing when you see so many happy couples. I wish I could be one of them...Any takers? haha im kidding...

Anyway, i hope everyone has a blessed Christmas and can make it through their last week of school!!

"event","So I was in a good mood Sunday morning when I typed my last entry....and then stuff happened. The following four things made me so frusturated and angry:
 1.) my mom threw away my advent wreath. although it was slightly dead and shedding leaves all over the table, it had sentimental meaning. I put in lots of work to make that- my finger even bled from picking the holly:( Plus, she threw everything away but the candles and just left them on the table to rub it in. poop.
 2.) I was really excited about youth group because NO ONE was at church that morning and so i wanted to see everyone. So i was babysitting for this family and they said that they would be home at like 7 so i would only be like 15 minutes late- they didnt get home til 8:25 so i couldnt go. poop. one redeeming thing about the babysitting job besides getting paid- their two year old and i were watching the Grinch and he fell asleep when he was laying on me. It was so cute and made me smile. Also, we listened to that Faith Hill song ""where are you Xmas"" like 437 times- i am obsessed!
 3.) Around like ten last night my mom and sister got in a huge screaming rampage around the house. Ugghh. I swear it is a ritual for them now. My sister is going off to college next year and she and my mom argue all the time about where she should go and why. Here is the sequence of events: Elias (her bf) comes home, she tells my mom how much she wants to go to Princeton, mom gets frusterated, Ans (sister) get pissed, they bring up random reasons why they are mad at one another, they yell and then they cry. What a peaceful enviournment right? No. So if anyone is looking for a sister that is usually in a good mood- despite the depressing entry- give me a call i would be quite appreciative. 
 4.) last thing and then i am done with my own rampage. its monday. that means four more frieking days til friday. poop.

So then today wasnt that bad...my spanish class is in a state of anarchy. all we do is sit there and talk while the teacher knits. thats public school for you. lets see what else happened today...hmm- oh i ate peppermint bark or whatever that stuff is called?! yummy. Oh- and i got 6th place in the debate tourn. darn i was hoping for first so i could have a plastic debate trophy. But i am really excited about tonight!! All the Happening team and candidates from our church are going to magiano's for dessert- YUM!! I am so sad that Blair cant come. oh well we still love her and will have to serenade her at church with my rendition of ""now we gather in this place""- lizzie and i make a wonderful duet and sound that far surpasses that of the talented Natalie! haha- not... 

Sorry about the depressing entry- i am really not always this pissed- i promise. Hope everyone had a wonderful day at school and i wish everyone a merry merry christmas!!

"event","Good morning everyone! These last few days have been very interesting...
  On Friday, I left school early because I had what I refer to as coughgitus- I dont think there is a real name for it. Then on Friday night I had to go to a cotillion dance even though I felt like crap. The dance was fun, but it kind of sucks to be the ONLY sober person there! It was humorous to watch extremely drunk girls make fools of themselves on the dance floor- you probably had to be there...not going to describe in datail;). I left early because the next morning I had to wake up at 7:30 for a debate tournament. WOW- that was an experiment. There were some extreme debators- I felt soo out of place. I did congress, in which you give prepared speeches on Congress. I don't really know who won becasue I didnt feel like staying at North Meck any longer...but I can assure you that the Indians won. Indians are amazing debators and I think I saw half of their country at North Meck on Saturday. When I got home I was exhausted and passed out at 8- the earliest I have been to bed since 3rd grade. It was amazingly wonderful. So...i hope my goober that wasnt there at church is doing OK, i hope you feel better aaron, and natalie i hope you are doing well-heard a rumor about surgery and i want you to know you are in my thoughts and prayers!! Jealous of everyone that went to Kiawa Island at church-hope it was a blast. By the way, is Brian getting the Hummer?!?!hope soo...

Lets see whats happened since sunday morning... i went and babysat and did nothing but watch the panthers game! i hate when they call you to babysit and the parents are there- i was hanging out at their house! whatever- i got paid. Then that afternoon i went to walmart which was absolutrly crazy!! i have never seen so many people all looking for the same thing- crazy soccer moms fighting over candy canes!? it was barbaric. So after that i went to EYC which was soo much fun. everyone was in such a good mood, brian was being a krunkoholic and we were all having a grand time...especially when i attacked mrs. konen in musical chairs- whoops! i am so violent- gees. by the way, awesome game liz. At the end of youth group, we sang a happening song which made me so happy- but it definately was a little off! haha- we still love the talents of blair and lizzie.    
 So this morning was a little rough. I hate going back to school on Monday- especially when it doesnt feel like you should be going. I spent half the night last night with Aaron and Lizzie talking on a chat room thing- hilarious conversations that will not be disclosed ;). haha. At school today, it was really boring. have you ever half fell asleep and your head was like bobbing around? yeah so that was me- and i woke up and everyone was laughing- felt a little silly but i remember i had a good dream, just cant remember it now! This week is crazy- tonight i have vball training so i can be a ref in spandex(no laughing), and the training lasts for 4 hours- i am bringing a buffet and a pillow. I also have to write like 10 speeches for this debate tourn. on sat.- all day hanging out with debate nerds(i have a sweatshirt so i include myself). well it has been a wonderful day but unfortunatly i must go do homework...talk to yall soon!!tay"

The sermon today was awesome: it was about love for others and learning to love God. It was cool- the whole time I was thinking about Happening and how much love was felt there. I LOVE ALL MY HAPPENING BUDS!! After the sermon, Shelbey and I just looked at each other and knew what the other one was thinking, that was neat. The Elizabeth got honored with this big award- i felt like her mom, i was so proud i just started to cry. Then we went to Sunday School, and ate and ate and ate. Shelbey and I concentrated more on the food( yummy nannas and grapes) then the discussion i think. whoops. But it was all good and we laughed lots which is always fun to do. So I came home after a great morning to the family. UGHH. Thats why I am blah instead of happy. So as soon as I walk in the door my brother is screaming at my mom because she doesnt know where his poster about the ""pyramid of success"" is, which my brother needs to read ironically.

"event","Hello everyone!! After an hour of figuring out how to start one of these things via the phone with lizzie, I have come to write my first live journal entry- this will be interesting! So since I dont really know where to begin, I guess my fun-filled day would be oh so titilating to read about. I woke up at 8 and went to church to assist in delivering trees. Eric and Brooke and I went around Charlotte in a beast of a white truck(shout out to Aaron:it wasnt quite as pimp as yours!haha)to deliver 6 massive Xmas trees. I would have never thought of that as a workout, but it was. So then we came back to the church in style and hung out with the other volunteers. Lizzie, Shelby, Leah, others, and I had wonderfully random converstations: where we would live if the world ran out of room(we decided an underground tunnel was the best option), how we should build a dome under the sea, and other topics that seemed hilarious at the time. Then, one of the highlights, we played frisbee with wood circles and jousted with Xmas tree branches. Thats when Shelbey fell over a Xmas tree when she was jousting me- one of the funniest things ever but im thinking you had to be there. Then we went to Qdoba- a first visit for me- and ate yummy food while being entertained by a drunk dancer getting his groove on to 80s pop rock stuff- much like Brian! The car ride home was scary- i was molested by 8th grade boys! A first I might add...After a complete and elaborate description of my day I think i am through!! hope everyone has a wonderful weekend and i will talk to you soon if i can figure out how to do it a second time! until then... 
god bless- taylor"

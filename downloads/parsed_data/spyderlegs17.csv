"event","Well Campus life isn't sooo bad right now.  I guess that's probably because it's just begun!  I can tell already though in some of my classes that there will be more work involved than with some of my other classes.  For example, My music class, we're pretty much restarting all the music theory we've done in grade seven.  Like last week on out first class, we learned how to write staff lines and draw out a piano keyboard.  Oh oh and yesterday, we learned how to count in beats of four!  I guess it was all news to the people who have no knowledge of music theory what so ever, but all I could do was sit back and enjoy how easy the course is so far, and apparenlty, it's not going to get much harder than some of the hings we covered last year in grade 12 band!  So I'm pretty stoked! Then there's my sociology class, where today i took 4 pages of notes during a lecture.  So yeah, it's a given on what I'll be concentrating on more.  Anyways, hope all is well with everyone else."

"event","So... never have I ever felt so upset about something I was totally prepared to give up last year.  This is my first summer in over 7 years where I have not been involved with camp, and it's actually torturing me.

I've written about 7 letter already to camp to some current CIT's and of course miss Janet Young to try and ease the sadness a little, and of course because they are my friends and I like to keep in touch.  But really, even though I really enjoy writting to my friends, it doesn't make me feel any better, knowing that I am stuck in this hot polluted city when I could be on an island actually enjoying life.  I'm literally surrounded by people and friends all the time here... but it still feels empty knowing that I am not out there.  I'm the exact person who I want to be out at camp, and it's the kind of person who i can't be in the city.  So I think that's another reason that I'm upset, my body is so used to this time of year, and where i normally am at this time of here is not the city.  I don't know if that makes any sense, but that's how i feel, and i couldn't feel any worse...."

I called the next morning at like 8:20am because the lines opened at 8:30 and i was like  "" there is now way I'm listening to that fucking hold music again"" so i wanted to be first hence why i called to stay on the line 10 minutes early.  It took 2 hours to fix the problm and yes I am registered for all my courses thank the Lord!!!  Apparently there were a lot of people with the same problem as me and a whole bunch of people couldn't sign up for the same french course as me, so yeah... it's over and I'm happy:).

First my course list deletes it's self three times on me, forcing me to start over.  Now I'm sitting waiting, for the second time for the u1 registration office to pick up, becusae apparently, i don't have the prerequisites for my music class and my french class, which i do because the prerequisite in my start book for french is french 40S, and  that i needed a consent form for  one of my music classe, which i also filled out and handed in..  This is BULLSHIT!!!  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH EASIER OVER THE PHONE OR IN PERSON.  It's going on 3 o'clock now and I work  @ 4.

"event","What a weekend.  I was there from last wednesday to this monday and it actually kicked ass.  Listenened to some awesome music, ate some kick ass food, Jordan and Paul came out for the day on friday, saw some people from school or  people who I haven't seen in a very long time.  I think the best part was that I was a volunteer again this year, and since i wasn't one crutched i could really come to appreciate the benefits of volunteering.  Like the free pass to the festival,  free meals,  access backstage any time you want... like who wouldn't want that.  And volunteering wasn't a big deal at all.  It was kind of fun actually.  I got to work backstage in the Green room (Where all the artists go before they play the main stage), back stage in the kitchen, and i also painted faces for about four hours in the family area.  Like seriously, you may think you may not be interested in folk music and all that jazz, but you might be surprised, because there is music from all over the world coming to this festival.  So i think everyone should go next year.  (everyone who is not working at camp....)Ok I'm out!"

The day we had all bought fancy dresses/tuxes to wear, jewlery, gotten expensive hairdo's and manicures.  It was the day all highschool graduated dream of from their first day of grade nine.  And now it's over.  I'm not trying to be super depressing, but it was  well worth the wait, and I can't think of a more fulfilling way to end off  the best four years of my scholastic years.  Everyone looked amazing, good food, great times dancing, playing some roulete and blackjack, winning some great prizes.  And i think only one person threw up! The point is...It was a fantastic night that i think most of us will remember for a  long time.

And I'm not just saying that to be sappy, I'm actually seriouse.  They say highschool is supposed to be the best days of your life, and i coulnd't have agreed more.  It's offered me so much, contributed by putting me on my career path, everything has happened to me in that school.  I think I'm also worrying about the future, and university, and all the pressures and the stresses.  Cause truly. I don't think i've grown up enough yet to accept that life is starting now.  It hasn't hit me at all yet.   Am I ever in for a wake up call...It's sad, but i guess all good things must come to an end...but why so soon??"

WE played  really well at all of the locations we performed at,  I spent lots in Mall of America (Probably not so much compared to some people).  Good times at Valley Fair suckh as the Sky Scrapper and..wait for it..... some thing kind of like   BUNGEE JUMPING WITH MA GIRL ASHLEY!!  WooHoo, I actually still can't believe i did that...It made you feel weightless and like you were flying.  It was so amazing and now i definately have something to cross off my life list!!!  It was definately so much fun.  WE went to this concert the last night of our trip to this jazz orchestra and  a famous Jazz singer by the name of Patti Austin was there and she was pro!  My mom happens to love her, so  just in time for mother's day I bought her a CD ang had it autographed for her! (WHICH SHE SOO LOVED BY THE WAY), and then she ended up coming on the bus after me and Danielle ha our CD's signed and she told us to pretty much keep playing music.  Which I definately don't wanna lose at all.  I honestly feel so lucky to have this advantage that so many other people don't have available for them, or just aren't interested in, because it's amazing.  K anyways, I really need to catch up on homework....PEACE!"

I<ve been working a lot lately, i guess i can't complain.  It's not as if it's hard cause it's really not at all, it's just time consuming.

"event","Well.. had my audition today.  I went in there scared out of my mind, but was pleasant just like Bobbi told me too, but i couldn't stop freaking shaking while i was playing, i was shaking so much it made me screw up a few times, but i think over all it could have been worse.

He asked me to play D major 2 octaves, and i when i tried I stopped because I was like, wait, I don't know this scale so i offered to play B flat 2 octaves and he said sure and i did that fine.  I had to sing, and sight read and read rythmes and then we had an interview.  Where they asked me stuff about school and what i  planned on doing with a degree in music and whe i said teach they sounded rather intrigued.  Apparenlty they have more pitty on the people who want to go into education then performance because of the demand and because you don't need to be a rock star to teach.

I realise that my chances of entering the music faculty are slim. VERY SLIM.  Because the amount of space that's left, i still want this sooooo badly though.  And there were like 10 other saxophones auditioning:(:(:(:(:(:(. Then i had my exam at like 1:30...OH MY GOODNESS!  they gave us a sample exam as part of the application and they weren't kidding when they said samples..instead of having to write maybe 2 scales, the was like 16!   they gave you demos for like every question, it took me longer using the ACOCA chart but it was really the only way i knew how to do it so i think i did ok..  This girl next to me was writting HUGE and  everytime i would look at the cloack to see how much time i had left, i would notice that she had the same answers as me, so i was like phew!  took a load of my chest!(and no i wasn't cheating.)  Anyways, i guess this was just a learning experience beause I'm almost positive i won't be accepted, but if i take lessons with the sax proffessor Allen, he'll take me the next time.

There were people waiting across the street who were waiting for the same bus except going in the opposite direction, and once that bus goes there to pick them up, the driver yells from across the street that we might as well walk because he was the only 76 bus running becuase the other ones got stuck and he was already an hour late.  So we started walking back towards my house thinking maybe we could catch the 14 on st. Mary's, which came in 6 minutes.  

FIRST OF ALL.  It took us such a longer than 6 minutes to walk in a foot of snow down our street to the bus, let alone walk down a few streets to get to another one that probably wouldn't accept any more passengers.  So we called up mommy and she let us stay home.  But we still had to do a shat load of shovellin' for us and our neighbours.

I didn`t go this year because i had a lot ofhomework and my mom need me to stay home and hand out candy while she was with nick at volleyball.  Anyways.  Now we have christmas to think about. You always know because the stores bring out all their christmas stuff suuuuuuuper early.  Anyways, peace!"

Like i have no time to do anything like constructive during my week, forcing me to wait until the weekend to get things that really need to get done.  And when i do hav e time during the week, I`m too tired to do it, so i sleep.  BAH!  It`s getting annoying, and i have so much English to do to fuck.  Sheesh!  WAs kinda funny how many people last night were under the influence of something yesterday.  It`s funny that Poirier had absolutely no clue.  Perhaps i should do english or something... Anyways, peace!"

"event","Well Well well.   As most of you know i had my very first car accident about a week and a half ago, and this morning around 7:30 i went to have it looked at and to get an estimate on the damage.  Now in my mind, the damage wasn`t bad at all.  It was the back of my car and some paint was missing and a little chip on the bottom part of my light.  So the guy is examining the car,  and then he finally tells me the price.  I was expecting him to say something along the lines of maybe, oh let`s say 120$.  HELL NO! FUGGER IS GONNA COST 1345$!!!!  I couldn`t believe it.  My eyes like bigged out of my head and i was like..`for a chip of fiber glass and some missing paint`?  Apparent;y they have to replace the whole bumper for God knows why, and the light ( which is way more understandable than the bumper).

So iunno, i freaked out at first, but then my mom and the lady explained that i only had to pay the deductible plus the 200$ sur charge, making a grande total of 400$.  I  was like phew!!  Did i tell you guys how it happened?  K it`s like this.

I was going down Kim`s street (Handyside) and it`s a pretty narrow road.  And I wanted to park infront of her house, so i would have to turn around somewhere because i was driving east and you had to park facing west. So i pull into this guys driveway, to turn around, and there`s this van parked on the side of the road that`s prolly not as close as it should be to the curb, and i like just tapped it.  There was more damage on there car then mine,  there was like a dent and paint missing from the side of their car ( it was a van).  so yeah, i was pretty pissed, but whatever.  According to my mom, it`s a `learning experience`.  whatever, I`m defintaly more catious now. It`s funny, because aftert i got home from kim`s, my mom told me to go pick my brother up from a party."

Anyways, not much more going on. Well, kinda, but it`s hard to say what really is going on.  So i just won`t talk about it because it`s too complicated.

I actually hate school right now.  Like I`m so tired all the time and I don`t get enough sleep and english is a loser.  Bah!  REally, teacher`s don`t understand, they say they do but they don`t.  And when they think they really understand, they think the remedy is more homework.  Like wtf??  First of all, what kind of teacher expect every student in his class to rea a book completely.  omg...."

Also, me and one of my friends just had a huge misunderstanding about the way things were going in our lives and this summer.  And we just got over that, and now,I`m very puzzled actually.  Because all of a sudden, one of my other friends is mad at me.

Yeah weird eh?  I'm actually supposed to be an Aide for this one kid who has impulse.  So like, he's look at a huge jumping rock, and wanna go jump immediately, but fortunately, he hasn'tshown any signs of his impulse.  He's actually just the same as the rest of the kids, i honeslty don't know why he needs an aide, or why I'm there.  There are other kids in that cabin who need more attention than he does.  So yeah, I'm pretty much a counsellor instead of an aid.  I actually come home this sunday coming up, It qwould have been friday but i decided to stay for staff banquet, which is just gonna be a huge end of summer party, shoudl be good times.  Anyways, i should go, I'm actually really tired.  Have a good one and i can't wait to see everyone in a couple of weeks."

"event","k well i was in for this weekend but I'm leaving today to go back in like half an hour.

I guess my first session was good, had senior girls.  Trail  sucked sooo much though.  My girls were all PMS'ing and they hated trail, plus i waited in the Kenora hospital for 5 BLOODY HOURS on monday cause one of my campers couldn't breath properly, and then the next day one of my other campers was having a freak panic attack making her have an asthma attack so, then i had to take her back to camp so she could go to the hospital too.

My birthday sucked ass actually.  I was soooooo sick with an ear and throat infection, and plus, it was the same day that we left for trail.  Oh well, my birthday has never really been a big deal though.  Although i did like how some people sent me presents and cards and stuff!:>:> That was so nice.  Anyways, i should get ready to give'er, have a good one, c u guys in 2 weeks.

<font face=""tahoma""><font size=2>This will be the first time i'm sleeping alone in three days. Well really five days if you count the fact that Dan stayed on the phone with me until five in the morning before that. I slept over his house three nights ago. We stayed up all night and watched movies and i comforted him by making him really funny signs for his bedroom. I woke up at twenty to ten in the morning because his mom turned off the air conditioning and i couldnt breathe. then i hung out with his mom for three hours because he wouldnt wake up. then my mom and i went and spent over a thousand dollars for dorm room shopping, buying things i dont even need.

Then that night, Dan and I both slept over Paul and Lauren's house. It was so much fun, we dressed up in all the different lingerie that i own and played twister and truth or dare. I dared paul to allow me to call him Paul Adam for two whole days. Pretty funny. Lauren passed out at four, and me, dan and paul hung out until seven. Then dan fell asleep. so paul and i kept talking for like an hour or two and then he was like 'okay time to go to bed' and i went and slept in laurens room.

So then yesterday i went with lauren and dan to this cd store, and i bought my mom thirteen lou reed records and a lou reed poster. then i went the bernacchio family and dan and kristen to a family graduation party. then to pat's house. and then lauren slept over. we went through my closet and she took all my sweaters because i wont need them for florida.

Today i hung out with john, and went to friendlys. THE ONE IN MASSAPEQUA. and then played pool at billiards with paul and kristen. then the three of us went gallavanting around town. and bellmore. and massapequa. and then found a picture of llamas humping each other online. and then i came home at two in the morning. and now im in a lynn university chat with people who will be going there with me. i'm excited, not gunna lie.

tomorrow im going to the gym because i feel gross since ihavent been there in two or three days.

then yea. going to guam to emotionally support angela because i love her.
even though she never has time for me. she will always be my true love. my angie bear.

goodnight everyone. im tired. i had a long past five days and nights. so im going to go talk to dan and then go to sleep alone. shocker. lol.

Today is... um. Sunday.
Wednesday and Thursday i was with my parents in Connecticut. We were staying at Mohegan Sun. It was kind of awesome. I decided to fight the urge of spending time at the casino. But the hotel was beautiful.
I spent most of my time working out and hanging out with my mom. The fitness center there is really nice.
And so is the pool that i jumped into to cool off lol.

The only sad part was that in order to go, i missed spending the last two nights with John before he left for his annual boat trip. But it's okay. I'll see him again in about five or six days. And then i'll have two weeks to spend with him and my loves until i leave for Florida.
Another reason i was debating whether or not i should go with my parents was because if i hadn't gone, i would have slept over Danny's house. And both of us have been dying to have a sleepover.
We'd end up in separate rooms, but i love spending time with Dan.

<center>ThE FirE DepartmenT Couldn'T DrowN ThE CitY<font color=#9900ff>
((they didn't even try to wash it clean))</center>


<font color=#ff0000>Speaking of Dan, i just got home from his house. We watched Shawn of the Dead. What a crazy fuckin movie lol.
Brad was with us for a bit. But then Karen called Dan, and he went into the other room. So Brad goes, ""I'm going home. Don't tell Dan. Let him look around the house for me."" And he left.
<center>[<B>P</B>uT <I>m</I><B>E</B> <U>out</U> cuz i'm on <B>F</B>u<U>c<I>K</U>i</I>n<B>G</B> fire]</center>
And Dan came in and looked under the covers, figuring i'd be hiding Brad there??? lol. Then in the closet. Then Dan's mom walked in and said, ""Are you looking for Brad? He left. He told me not to tell you, he thought it would be funny."" And Dan STILL searched the house for him. It was kind of hilarious, but i was trying to watch the movie.
So he called Brad and realized he was actually on his way home.

Man Brad is the GREATEST. haha.

((The most that i can do for you is keep on lying.))
((It's not a lie if you can let it sing.))

So i guess i should start packing soon. But i'm kind of very busy lately. Working on John's bday present. Oh i bought him today one of the things i'm giving him. I can't say what it is incase he reads this. But i got him something from one of the gift shops at Mohegan Sun. The place was like a fucking mall. But yea, i got him this stupid little thing but it's adorable. It's a 'Glasses Holder' for..  you know.. eyeglasses. And it's a soccer ball (because he plays soccer...) and it has a nose on it, so that the glasses will stay up. Oh it's hilarious. Here:

But right now i should get back to the chatroom i'm in with pat and dan. Because right now theyre talking about like bashing each other's heads in with their miniscule penises and skull fucking people. Yea really scary. Time to separate them and put them into time out.

"event","Last night John took me into the city, to take me out to dinner, as my graduation/'mal's leaving soon' gift. lol. He told me to pick out any restaurant in the world, without regarding the prices (because i always take that into consideration. if he had left out that detail, i would have chosen like Taco Bell or something. Seriously.). So i chose Carmine's. It's a restaurant in the city, on a street right off of Time Square. I love it it's my favorite place ever. It's family style dining and really expensive, but the food is SO good. John and i are absolutely in love with this dessert they have. it's called a chocolate torte, and it's like heavenly. It's really, really rich chocolate. and thats it. with like strawberries and whipped cream.

So we went into the city and we were supposed to leave around one or two, and ended up catching the 4:o0 train. We got there promptly at 5:o1. So we got to Carmine's, and they weren't taking any people on the waiting list. Which was so weird - that <I>never</I> happens. So we went two blocks over and went to another place called Tony's. The calamari was pretty awesome, the dinner was okay, and the dessert was amazing. Perfect.
Then we went to Toys R Us and rode the ferris wheel lol. And we bought the picture. 
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y116/Switch127/ferriswheel.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
(I know it's fuzzy. I took a picture OF the picture with my digital camera bc i was too lazy to scan it. It'll be up soon enoug in my picture log.)

So then we took a cab down to central park, and we took a carraige ride around the park. It was pretty late, and at ten, someone started shooting fireworks off of the main lawn. It was a little foggy out, so the sky starting turning different colors. It was kind of beautiful.

Then i took a picture in front of this huge elephant in a diaper. lol. Here it is:
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y116/Switch127/elephant.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
(Once again, crappy bc i took a picture of the picture with my digital. I promise itll be way better when i get the real one up.)

So yea.Kind of awesome. John's so good to me. :)"

long time no post :)
life is good.
i have been spending lots of time with john and kristen, and more time than usual with danny.
it's nice.
Everybody has been quite happy. i'm pretty sure kristen and paul are going good, and john and i have been quite fine, and i'm extremely happy for dan and ally because they make each other happy as well.

i have a friend to go to college with, im so very excited. i was so nervous, having to meet so many new people, going to a new school in a new state, on my own, meeting a roomate. now at least i'll have somebody i know to experience everything with me. we're going to hang out soon. i'm very very excited.

i should really be leaving to pick john up from work right now. so i guess i can't leave a very long post.

it was nice to check back in though.

yea things have been okay with people lately.
i fougt a little bit with john last night, but no big deal. just some misunderstandings, and i fell asleep. lol.
i cant wait to give him his christmas presents. im so excited. i didnt get him that many great things this year. last year may have been better than this year will be but oh well. im short on cash. so i cant get anything else fantastic. i already spent a fortune on him.
i cant wait to see what he got me :)
i have a pretty good idea of one of the things he got me ::grins evilly:: of course, aside from the tshirt and the headband i made him get me.
cmon he HAD to get me the shirt. i could have bought it myself but it just wouldnt mean as much.

today was such a bad day.
it wasnt horrible, just really bad. i woke up late, i was supposed to pick up money at kristens on the way to school and accidentally passed and i had to go back. ugh. that just ruined my morning. but my peanut butter and fluff sandwich made that a little bit better :) fuckin love them.

i was showering before, and realized that i needed a pack of refill razors for my.. razor.. lol. and i thought back to over the summer when my mom realized that i seriously do cut myself - when she stopped taking it as a joke, she asked me what she was supposed to do when i asked her for razors.
i mean, besides the fact that the razors i shave with have safety guards on them (you think thats by accident?) i refuse to use disposable razors to shave my legs because they trigger me.

so anyway, thinking about that made me think back and i realized how long it has been since i've cut myself. its not like i was trying to stop, but for the period of time that i havent forced scars onto my flesh, i'm really happy. i dont know what it is. i have been so happy since me and john got back together.

i remember way back, when john used to try to 'kiss my scars away.' and dan used to also. dan always took care of my cuts when i gashed myself up.

dan really is awesome. he can be really mean sometimes but he really is a caring person if he wants to be.

[and dan... im really glad that you called me tonight even though we only talked for like two minutes. i'm glad you know that you can come to me even just to have the comfort of confiding in someone. feel better. x3 ]

ahh john.
i fucking love him.

i'm glad things are back to the way they used to be, because i think that's where i went wrong, and that's where i lost myself.

things can be better now.
i'm actually happy. i can't believe that i remember how to be, but somehow i do. for the time being at least. i hate myself in so many ways, being happy or content in anyway seems like such an accomplishment.

and me and laura are seeing return to neverland this saturday no matter what! damnit! WOOO im excited. elphie and gaaalinda are off to see johnny depp <33

this year is going to be amazing. i won't let it disappoint me, it's my last year here. i want everyone to know how much they mean to me.

<B>i'm not holding grudges</B>
and i accept people...generally...
...excluding like cory ellis.
sorry but i just cant ever NOT hold a grudge against him.

everyone else though.. i love you all.

Nothing will <I>ever</I> turn out the way that you want it to.

And sometimes, after a year or so, you get tired of the phone ringing, and you'll ignore that call every now and then.

And i would like to thank YOU for that.

Love always,
x Mal x




B.T.W. i would greatly appreciate it if nobody made any comments on this entry. No good ones, no bad ones, no nothing. Just please, i beg of you all, i don't care about your thoughts on the matter, any comments will be deleted unless if they're written by john himself, because the fact of the matter happens to be that i need to get this out there, because john deserves to know what i think of him, and that he really is truly amazing. And if any of you have a problem with that, you can talk to me all you fucking want, just don't leave a comment. We all need to grow up a little bit anyway. Well here's your chance everybody. x3"

im really sick of living my life predicting bad things that could happen.
i always have a feeling when something bad is going to happen.

today i thought it was going to be something in school for some reason, and i told laura. i thought it may have been something dealing with this whole situation with dan. but nothing happened. everything was quite calm with no wake. and i was surprised. so i thought that all of the bad things that could possibly happen would have subsided by the time school ended.
fucking WRONG.

we ended up going to calv, and okay so i think now that the world knows whats going on between me and dan because i only um wrote about it?
but yea so dan had called kristen and asked for a ride, but she was getting a ride from me. so i offered him a ride too, to be nice. he wasnt expecting it, but i figured it would be nice this way he could see a particular someone he has been waiting to see. well that someone wasnt there tonight, but thats besides the point and he came with us anyway. i thought it was going to be awkward but it really wasn't much.
dan and i bought presents for tim before we went to kristens to get her and john, and then we were off and on our way to surprise paul :)

so we get to calv at 7:30 and its fucking jam packed, there were fifty ppl outside waiting to get in, and it was already max cap downstairs, so they werent letting anyone in. so for like two hours we stood outside freezing our balls off [except for me and kristen, bc we dont have balls] and then we went to burger king, and kristen licked peanut butter off of my tongue while paul watched thinking in his head 'shes mine bitch' lol.

but yea so then we got into calv thru the back entrance, caught pat. pen. last few songs, and operator operator. it was fun. i saw people. i came, i saw, i conquered. and i thought the night was good but life sucks. and it wasnt good. because blah.

but dillon made me feel loved :)

emily and kristen are over now, we're supposed to go to HorseBarnFarm! in the morning, but kristen and i may skip out because of certain reasons. and yea.

life blows.
what the fuck.
im not even complaining for myself this time.
but what the fuck.

damnit.

okay update.
yea dan decided that we should still be friends, and that hed put in more effort. That was his decision completely, and i put no say in the matter.
He decided this the other day. On... Tuesday, after school, while i was over his house.
And then um. He took advantage of me again, like he always does, because i'm a retard and i let him walk all over me. I brought him home to get his house key during my lunch period even though i had to meet with Mrs. Turner to go over my college essay. But i figured i'd bring him home, since he would appreciate that. And he didn't. And my fucking college essay should be the only important thing right now because if i don't get it done i won't get into the college i want and if i do get in i won't get dibs on the dorm i want. ugh. fucking sucks.
But yea so anyway.

I brought him home during lunch, and then he said hed do something for me.
And i knew he wouldn't.
So i told him if he didn't want to, just tell me.
And he said he would. And so i didn't believe him, and he didn't come through with his word, so i freaked out on him.

I felt bad at first, after i freaked out.

When i get really angry i yell and scream and everything, but then i get really emotional over it and always fall into hysterics, crying my eyes out. So i was crying, and then i saw laura in the hallway, and she was supposed to have done something for me, and she hadn't so i kind of freaked out on her too, though i didn't mean to. She was just kinda like 'wtf did i do NOW' lol.

so then we went outside for a cigarette and had a chat, it was a nice chat. but it was really cold outside.

So dan found out about a few things after school, but as always he doesnt know how to fend for himself or to just BE PLAIN FUCKING HONEST WITH ANYONE, so he left.

i went to extra help for statistics and laura waited for me, but then she wanted to flip a shit on dan, so i brought her to find him. and she freaked, kind of.
So i talked to mike while she talked to dan. and i asked him for my american pie 2 dvd, but he cant find it and that made me sad lol.

So um. Dan told laura that he hates my guts. and i find it funny.

And i knew the end was coming so im not really all to surprised. its sort of a relief to get everything off my shoulders now, one less thing to be burdened with.

its just that, i really thought dan was somebody who i could rely on. and he told me that he loved me way more than once, i guess im just gullible enough to fall for that everytime.
but dan wasn't looking for the same thing i was.
he was looking for a trophy.
and i was looking for a companion who wouldn't betray me.

<B> Well im not willing to be a trophy.
And i guess he wasn't willing to be somebody to rely on</B>

and the fact is, he lost two really great friends. he lost me and laura.
and no matter how much he says he doesnt care i know he really does.
and i hope he fucking cries his eyes out over it every fucking lonely night.

because i won't be the one to cry over him.

believe it or not, im stronger than that. and i know i show a lot of weakness, but i only show weakness to people whom i care about. i care about dan, i cant help that, but he wont ever see a sign of weakness from me again. and i wont have a sign of weakness for him. because it makes me feel better that i dont have to deal with a lying, manipulative, arrogant asshole anymore.

i dont need to cry.

i have friends who i know WILL be there for me. and i love them with all of me, and theres none of me left to go around for faggots who only want to care when they have time to.

i think that im just about having the worst week ever, and its just gotten started. last week i had strept, so ive been taking amoxicillon [you kno.. the pink stuff?] and my body had a reverse reaction to it, not quite an allergic reaction, but w.e, and i have a rash over my entire body and the itchiest parts of my body are the palms of my hands and the bottom of my feet. agh. so torturous.

itchy and scratchy to the literal term. lmao lau.

okay so im rashy.

im also sick and tired of life. like really i just want to fucking dig a hole and fall asleep in it, and never wake up ever again. i've been incredibly depressed lately, and most people i know havent been helping.

speaking of people. ugh. im in a big stupid fight with dan, and id really rather not be friends with him. but i was fucking stupid and i left the decision up to him, so obviously im not getting an answer anytime soon. because people like him never change. and they always pretend to care but realistically theyre so predictable. and dan knows that i know him better than the back of my hand. well thats just dandy, i fucking hate it.

i want a real friend for once. just for a little while i suppose. just to see what it feels like.

well dans on the phone now so i must be going

im gunna miss him a lot. hes the only sane wantagh person.
or maybe the only wantagh person as <I>insane</I> as me..
because i relate to him a lot.. excluding the fact that hes a guy lol.
but hes very sweet and i *heart* him a lot.
we talked about everything from the origins of earth and mankind to wrestling to sex and relationships. we walked around town as his 'farewell to wantagh' and sat behind the elementary school bc he hasnt been back there since b4 it was added on to... and then he walked me home and bought cigarettes on the way because hes a bad boy lol.

well there goes the last respectable wantagh-ian.

"event","I am sorry for everything I have ever done! May, I am sorry I have been so hard on you, but the truth is, you are great, and I am so glad Margery has found someone so great. You have your flaws, like everyone else, and I am sorry that I was so mean! Margery, I don't know what I said that made you so mad at me, I am sorry. If you think I am two faced, then it must be true, because you know me very well, and may and john told me that as well! I know I am not always right, and I have stopped trying to be ever since you brought it up that one time a while back. I am sorry for the pain I have caused you as well. To Sarah, thanks for always being there, and never taking thinkgs I saw to heart...it makes it alot easier to know that you know I don't mean it. Amy, same to you, you are one of those people who have always been there. I hadn't talked to you since the middle of school, but choose you to call out of everyone, because I knew you'd be there, you always are. To reed, I am sorry for screwing you over, and what ever made you mad at me..I am truely sorry for! I know I have been a bitch, but I want to change...whether you want to be there to watch me is your choice. I know I have made some bad decisions in the past but I am really sorry for the pain I have caused! I know a simple sorry doesn't make up for a lot but, I hope someday you will let me show you, let me prove to you that I love you, always have, and always will! I hope everyone wont stay mad at me, because of what I have done! I don't mean to hurt anyone...as most of you know..I just try to help! I messed up real bad this time..and I am sorry to everyone I brought down in the process! Thank you to everyone for listening!"

I got  on and my name was for margery, who ever wrote that shit about john, and some people from my past. None of that had to do with you, and you got mad! You weren't the only one accused. So was Reed, Bishop, and even sarah. Infact, I think John might have even thought I did it. I didn't do shit..you just got all pissed off! I don't know why...i didn't strait up accuse you...i just asked if reed thought it was you! That is it...nothin wrong in that!"

What is up ya'lls! Dude, someone keeps getting on Johns shit and being gay! Damn, I only know of one person who uses FAG and BUHLER BITCHES in the same sentences...and I think everyone can agree on who we think it is! My god, that is so gay that someone can say that, what the hell is the point! But, what ever floats your boat!

"event","OK, I have some more to say! I am so confused! Why are all of us fighting with Amy? We all have been friends for at least 3 or 4 years and all the sudden a little fight has us talkin shit and stuff! Amy, you were all talkin shit, and I did go tell John and Margery and the reason I didn't say anything is because I am trying to teach my self to keep my mouth shut! You know I need to do that! But yeah, we have been friends for ever and now we act like we hate each other over some guy shit! We all have promised not to do that...and this shit is stupid. I don't even know why we are fighting. We sat there and tried to help her by telling her so she wouldn't waste anymore of her life, and then she gets mad when we didn't do shit except relay on the message we had heard to help a friend! Where is the wrong in that! I don't know! But if someone could please tell my why we are all fighting!"

That's just not something you don't take personal. And how John was just trying to act cool! Number one, no one was around, and two, if he was just trying to be cool, then the rest of us were too! We just try to be cool for each other...yeah, thats right. And how do you not take something personal when they say your name. Amy your stupid, but don't take it personal!"

"event","I am in a good mood today and I don't know why. It has been a horrible day. I woke up to my mom screeming at me telling me to clean the basement. Then she said I could help chloie move tonight (justin's mom) and I was mad. I was trying to get out of the house and forgot all kinds of things. My belt, my bookbag, underwear, lol, and I didn't brush my teeth. I got to school and rememberd I had to read 3 chaps in english, I had a worksheet and an assignment in Geometry with a quiz and a biology test. I didn't get to study or do any of my home work in the 3 most important classes. Grr. Then in english I was sitting there and got THREE pink slips. One for leaving my disc man on the bus and needed to come and get it. One for having 7 tardies, and one for getting an eighth on. But, I am still in a good mood.

I have been really moody latly and that is because everyday I am either sick of everyone or it seems like everyone is sick of me. I have been trying to avoid people and shit. But today I am just really happy. Sorry I have been snappy, I guess I can't help it. Latly if someone is mean to me, I am mean to them for like a week. Margery, If your track meet is at home on friday, I will come! Since I have a friday I will be able to come when I get out. Maybe I can get reed to come and pick me up and maybe you too! 

This weekend is my birthday and I have to spend friday night at school in a class room, then I have to stay at home on satuday because I am grounded. Reed promised me that I would have a good ""sweet sixteen"" but that was a lie! Oh well, I knew it wasn't going to happen anyways. I guess that is what me and Margery have in commom, no one care enough to do somthing special for us. But, hey! That is ok, I didn't do anything for anyone else.

This last weekend really stunk. I went out of town to KC with Reed and it totally blew. He pissed me off. I took him up there to get him away from his house, and to spend some time with him. I just wanted to cuddle the whole way up there, and it seemed all he wanted to do was anything but that. When we got there, he decided to make buddy buddy with landon. Everytime I would ask if he wanted to go do something he would stay in the house with landon or sit there and play on his damn cell phone. That night at the bond fire I would try to say somehting and he intrupted me twice with ok? or anyways! I was pissed. Then the next day he laughed at me when I said that I had to stay home on my birthday. He swears he didn't laugh, but I don't know. I guess I won't be able to take another guy on a family trip again. I thought he would make it better, but he made it that much worse. He asked me that night if I wanted to take a break and I just sat there. I don't because I will miss him, but I do because I don't want him to think that I will just forgve him for everything anymore. 

Yesterday at lunch jeff pissed me off really bad. He asked if me and reed would come over to some house to take pictures before rex and rossi left and I said reed would but I didn't know if I would. He automatically made the assumption that it was because I didn't want to be around those people, but that is wrong. I don't ahve a problem with any one of them...they are all tight no matter how much shit they talk. I didn't know if I would be there because I didn't know if me and reed would be tight on that day. But I think we will. 

Well, this is my week so far. and the rest of the week looks good, grounded, have my birthday, and that is about it. Oh, and how my mom bought my brother his firt two cars...well she says she didn't and it was monty. I said fine, even though she was lieing, and said I would buy it my self and she wouldn't be able to touch it, but she swears she can. If her name isn't on it, she can't touch it. From now on, I am going to get a job, get everything myself, and save some money, so I can move out. I don't know where I would go, but that is ok. I am planning on emancipation sometime in the next year to year in a half. Maybe reed and I could get somthing together! 

Ight, lata beaners!

Today is 11 months. Can you imagin being with someone that long...I used to not be able to believe it now I can't imagin my self without him. It is weird. My life at home sucks but when I leave that door it seems to be better, exspecially when I am leaving to see him! lol! That is enough of that sappy shit!

I talked to Stafford today..and he never said any of that shit. About sarah dancing. He said it the next day, but it was just a joke. I don't know who said he said that but now it is all cleared up, he didn't! So sarah, you gotta love him still! Well, you know what I mean! At least now you don't have a reason to hate him! So you can at least talk to him as a friend! Yeah! lol!

Then we went straight to reed's and I was really mad..I don't know why! I was sitting there shaking and crying for like 30 mins. It was sad. He took me inside and I sat there...and I ended up crying myself to sleep..funny way to end prom. I woke up the next morning at like 8:30, and we started our day of moving mary out of the house. She is almost completly out, thank god! lol! I guess Sarah had a pretty good time at prom. Alot of shit was said by stafford..and I spent an hour last night defending him to sarah saying he didn't say it, he didn't mean it..and I don't know why I defended him. I guess because I hope he really didn't say that, because that would be jacked up. I think everyone had fun at one point or another. I don't know if I want to go next year, I think the prom will suck but I will want to go to after prom because BUHLERS is better than HUTCH's! ha ha! 

Today is me and Reeds 11 month and this saturday is his 18th birthday. I really don't want him to be 18 because then he will want to go do things that I can't do. It is going to suck some serious ass! He will stay out and I will have to go home! Grr.. But I am going to be 16...that will be cool! I will be able to drive legaly...I don't know what I will drive but yeha...if they opportunity arrises...I will have a lisens. This weekend my family is going out of town. They said they didn't have enough room for me to go...and they are taking 4 vehicals. I don't get it. There is only 8 people going. Two trailers, two trucks...two cars. that is two spots to sit for only 8 people...I don't know. It is weird...but that is ok! I am going to try to make reed's birthday good...I think he will like it. I am taking him out to eat at Carlo's O Kelly's...nothing special, but I think he will like it. THen I guess we will prolly just go somewhere...and do nothing. I wish I had money and lived in a different town so I could make it special. I wish I could do more for him. He has done so much for me!

"event","Damn this is some pshyco shiznit up in her! Margery and Sarah are fighting because they took each others shit wrong. Yeah, Margery said some shit but she was expressing her opinion, and I agree it needed to be said. Then Sarah got mad because she expressed her opinion back and margery got mad. Margery gave an opinion not expecting to get one back. So they went off on each other. Sarah called me, I told her what I thought about it all and we both came to the conclusion that we can all figure this out some other time after prom. We both think that it is Reed, May, and Staffords choice on who goes with who. If may wants to go with stafford then he should have the right to go with out us girl friends buting in. It is THIER senior prom. Sarah said she would keep her mouth shut the whole time, that Sarah and Margery could get along for that night and then figure it out or never talk again after that. I think that would be best, to get over all the personal problems to make their prom the best. Now if May has a personal problem with sarah or somthing..then that is fine. But I think they should make up their own minds on it! 

Man, I was supposed to go up to hutch to see reed, after the last couple days with school and family I really needed someone, but the thing I was going up there for got canceled so I am stuck at home with my mom. Great! I can't wait to get out of her! 

I guess I choose Reed instead of Wynoka. I told me mom infront of Cy and Dustin that I might be going and margery would go with me...and Cy and Dustin go no, we don't want you to go, and my mom goes yeah, we already planed on you not going. Then dustin is like even if we did want you to go we don't want Margery going. So I got pissed. Then later that night when I got out of the shower I heard my mom and Dustin talking and he goes man, we made it the weekend of the 8th for a reason and now Cegan wants to go. I was like OMG! It is so messed up. My brother is taking his girl and dustin is taking his bestfriend but no, I am family, and I can't go! I don't know what to do anymore! I used to be able to go to school and escape all the bad shit, now I can't even do that. Amy has a lot of shit going on at home, and I am sure that is why she hates drama so much. I really hope prom goes ok, that will be the only time I can away for a while!

I don't know...I will choose later! He can go do somthing with his friends and all, I just don't like that fact I am ditching somthing that I love for him to ditch me..um no, don't think so! lol!

All that shiznit between Sarah and Amy is weird, it is none of my buisness and when I started to make it mine, Amy made sure I knew not to. Opps, I was just trying to help. Oh well! 

I wish people would apoligize when they do things wrong, and they know it. People get in bad moods and take it out on other people. But it is all goodyfull! 

I think my mommy might be getting me a car. I am going to be cruzin, and that will be tight. I saw it in her little note pad she keeps, but I am not quite sure. She is also looking for a four wheeler so we can go to wynoka again, that will be tight. I think she is looking for a camper so we can go camping...Yeah margery! That will be tizight! 

Prom is going to be so scary...I think post prom will be cool though, if it is like buhlers then it will be. REED, there is summa-wrestling! Yeah, bring it on bia! I am getting this spray on tan thing, and I guess if you don't do this one thing you get bloches...you don't turn orange but yeah! I am scared that I am going to look like a dork at Reeds only senior prom. I got a really cool dress though, I don't realy like it but everyone says it looks ""ok"" so hopefully they are right. Sarah is going with Stafford. I wish Sarah would just give him a chance instead of going off of physical. He is so freakin tight but that is her choice. I think we all will have a really good time at prom. I think we might double date. I don't know if May and Margery are going to too, they might do there own thing. I just don't know. It would be cool to get a limo but that is way way way to expensive and they margery and may would definatly not go. I would like them to come but yeah, I don't know. Me and margery agree that we better make the plans or they won't be made, and they really havn't been made yet, we don't even know where we are going to eat. They are dorks!

Well, we started going&nbsp;and the car infront of us completly slammed on there breaks infront of us for no reason..and flipped us off so we flipped them off back. Well we started going again just cruisin and we got to my road about to pull in and then they did...so we went on by, they flipped around and followed us and we drove through town to office max and were going in circles just singing and making fun. well they got sick of circles and cut us off and were like do you have a problem...we were like uh uh uh NNNO...lol..they were kinda scary...I would have got my ass beat...but me knowing this still open my mouth...I was like yeah...thank god they didn't hear me! Whew...I need to work on keeping my mouth shut! AHH&gt;.I am going to die some day! LOL</P>
<P>In a bit I am supposed to go to the movies with my mommy her boyfriend and his kid and reed is supposed to go..I guess if he doesn't call I won't be able to pick him up..then he will be pissed for sure! I don't know what i am supposed to do though! I guess just pray he calls!</P>

"event","Ight...first of all! Last night was purty tizight...I played basketball and now have two swollen arms, a scrap down my left arm and bruses's on my hip and leg! I love it..I can make REED feel bad for it! It tis great! Um...this morning was cool! Dude, I am seriously getting sick of people thinking they know more then me...yeah, you might...but try to show it because then you look stupid and you piss me off! Um, I was told to drop everything with everything so I did! I saw vern and just kept on my way. Then he said that he wanted to do some shit to me and sarah! I was like ha ha ..do sumptin! Don't tell me to drop this shit now..Ace and Brian don't have themselves in it..but when they say somthing about me..I am going to keep it going..this is my fun...I am not going to drop it so don't try to get me too! Um...I saw Andy after school..he is soo nice but I wish he wasn't so stuckup and would come and hang out some time! Oh well, maybe someday he will come around! That is about how my day went..pretty gay but I was in a good mood! Oh...this morning! I forgot! May was being pissy and I was in a good mood so I was messing around making jokes about Margery and him and he got mad and hung up on margery. It was stupid...if someone hung up on my for no apprent reason they would be dead..well, I would not call them back! I understand why Margery did because she doesn't liek people being mad...but he hung up on her again and was like call me back when your friends arn't around...SHE IS AT SCHOOL...she can at least talk to her friends at school since she is with you all night! DAMN! I understand why you guys hang out because I want to hang out with Reed alot..because I have a blast with him and I don't feel like people are making fun of me and he always has time for me...just like how may and margery feel..but May got mad for somthing stupid..hung up on her...and then said to call back when her friends were gone..I thought it was hella stupid but hey, I could be wrong..that is just my opinion. Oh well, I am not mad...just feeling gay! lol! Ight, I am done with this thing! lata love ya! Peace

Yeah, I know he might have taken his girls side instead of his friend but no one knows if that is true. I will always take James's side over someone else's, no matter who! I don't think he did anything wrong and Sarah getting him in trouble for what his chicky did was mean but I can see where she was coming from. It is all good though, James is tight and will get over it! lol! After school I went and saw Ace and Brian, that was cool! I fell down the steps! I was embarrases then I got home and did it again. I had just said yesterday...one of these days I am going to fly down these steps..and sure enough..I fell down my own and someone I verily know's. It was cool...Justin and Vern almost got beat up...kinda funny if you ask me! I just hope Andy don't get caught up in that shit...I know I don't talk to him anymore but he's still the tightest!

"event","Howdy Hoe Futher Muckers! Damn, I am in a really good mood. My spring break has been pretty awesome. Hmm...lets see...I went to witchita to the arena x, and went shopping! It was a blast. Then uh everybody became friends who hated everybody else, that was pretty exciting. I spent a lot of time with Reedster! It was great! Um, then Wednesday I went to the lake, that was a blast! I was really tired at the end of the night, and extremly pissy! Like usual of course! Go me! Yeha,! Um, then I woke up on Thursday and I didn't want to do anything...so I didn't. I stayed in my P.J.s all night! I was so happy! I even took a napster! I got up went and road my horsey, well, my grandma's! But I had to check my panties when I got off because it decided to run off with me and almost ran to the K-61 highway! I was crying! Then I took a shower and went over to Margerys and I hung out with Bishop Reed Margery May and Myself! We just chilled and then they went home and me and margery went to sleep. May came over in the morning and him and Margery went fishing. I waited for a wee bit and Reed came to pick me up...I went to his house and I came home to watch a movie, trying to be sneeky because my mom had a date and I THOUGHT I would have the house to myself...that is where I was wrong...her and her damn date were HERE! blah...i was grossed out! lol! But yeah..me and reed picked up a movie and went back to his house..we planned on him bringing me home after the movie...well, that is where I was wrong AGAIN! His mom asked me to just stay the night! Yeah...! I was like sweet! She was gone until 4:30 in the morning so me and reed had some time to just chill! Nothing happened you sick fucks! lol! I was supposed to go riding again today with John and my grandma's trail riding group but it was raining so she called it off! I was sad but now I am at home...waiting for reed to call! I had a freaking awesome spring break...hell yeah for me! I spent everyday almost with reed..everyday but 1! Goo me! Lata dawgs!"

I don't really know what to think of everything going on anymore. I tell Sarah just about everything and yeah, I have never said anything about you. I know I have said shit about you when you weren't there but that is just because I was pissed and the thingss said were the things that needed to be said. Now, I am not saying sorry for everything we have written and shit because I truly believe it needed to be said. I know you may not realize it now but hopfully you will realize it someday. I lost a best friend too. Everytime me and Sarah went running, we usually ended up talking about you and Dustin and how I wish you guys would take a break. I miss my best friend. Well, I thought you were still cool with me until you decided to write that stuff. That was just messed up. I know you feel like everyone hates you, I feel like that two most of the time but you can't just say stuff like that when ever you please because you have to think about the people who read it and their feelings. I know when you say it you really don't care what other people think but you hurt people when you say shit. You prolly don't care because of all the shit that has been said on this thing but that is fine because I think it was needed to be said. I don't hate you and I would care if you moved but I don't think somthing is going to happen with you and Dustin. That is just me though. I just thought you should know that, so yeah. I don't know what would happen if you moved, but I wouldn't suggest it. I would miss you, but it really wouldn't be any different then now. You never talk to me, call me or anything. You are at work, track, or with Dustin. It is cool, I will except that you arn't going to change just because we want you to. I dont know where I am going with all this, but you know me pretty damn well so hopfully you can make since out of my none since."

"event","It's my second night sleeping in my dorm and it feels kinda weird without Jasmine! i miss her so much. i'm used to seeing her everyday even if i don't sleep with her. so not sleeping with her and not seeing her is a little much right now. tomorrow starts the fist day of classes and i'm kinda anxious. i'm happy being at school but a part of me is not complete because i just wish Jasmine could be here with me! she's my best friend and i'm a little lost without her! i can't even call if i wanted to cause my cell is off for the moment and i can't call her from my room phone, so i've talked to her twice today! she says she even misses me harassing her and calling her off the hook! well i'm bout to get some sleep cause class will be starting before i know it!"

"event","Yo i finally started school! J&W in Prov. is real straight! i like my roommates. i miss my girls. i can't even talk to them cause my phone got shut off cause of my cousin can't pay a bill. that's the only thing that sucks. it should be turned back on when i go home this weekend. Me and my girl are doing so good. She finally is stepping the fuck up and she's handling her business. I love her so fucking much, I don't know what i would do without her. She's my Everything and now she's proving to me that i'm her Everything. 
    My mom could not stop crying yesterday after she left me up at school She kept saying how proud she was of me and i'm glad that i made her this happy by making this decision to come to school after not coming right after i graduated. I really can't believe I've been out of school for 2 years. I don't know why i waited so long i wish i would of made this choice so long ago. If i wasn't in school right now i probably would either be with my girlfriend or i would be at my best friend Jaysin's house. Ohh i miss Jaysin right now i can't wait to see her on Friday. The gay club I be going to is literally down the street from my dorm. If i wanted to walk there it would take me about 10-15 min. That's crazy it's bugging me out that i'm really living in Prov. right now. This was definitely one of the best moves I've made my whole life and i'm very happy i did it. Even though Prov. is only a half an hour away it doesn't feel like it. I'm so glad to be away from my hood and all the drama that surrounds my old lifestyle. I'm also gassed my girl will be getting away from there also cause she can come up here on the reg. an chill with me and i already know she's gonna be up here a lot. That's for damn sure. Well i gots thangs to do!

"event","YEAH I KNOW IT'S BEEN A WHILE BUT I'VE BEEN M.I.A UNTIL RECENTLY. MY BOO DID THE DIP SET ON ME AND ME AND MY EX ARE A WRAP LIKE NEVER BEFORE. I GUESS ME AND MY EX SHOULD OF BEEN OVER A WHILE AGO BUT IT'S HAPPENING NOW. MATTER OF FACT IT HAPPENED TODAY. I GOT CAUGHT UP IN A LIE AND NOW SHE'S GOOD WITH ME BUT SHE ACTS LIKE SHE HASN'T EVER LIED TO ME BUT IT'S ALL GOOD CAUSE I'VE BEEN PREPARING MYSELF FOR LEAVING HER FOR A WHILE AND WHEN SHE CAME AT ME TODAY WITH ""I'M GOOD, U LIED"" I THOUGHT YEAH BUT SO HAVE U AND I STILL BEEN HERE WITH U THROUGH ALL UR BULLSHIT. BUT LIKE I SAID IT'S ALL GOOD CAUSE THIS NEEDED TO HAPPEN OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS  BEEN BAD FOR A WHILE NOW. BUT OF COURSE I'M ALWAYS GONNA LOVE HER, I MEAN SHE WAS MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND. SHE IS THE ONLY GIRL I'VE EVER BEEN WITH AND NOT BEING WITH HER IS GONNA TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO BUT I KNOW WHAT I'M WORKING WITH AND I KNOW I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN MAKE MYSELF HAPPY AND BEST BELIEVE I WILL BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BEING SINGLE. THE SAD THIGN IS, IS I'M NOT UPSET. I'M OKAY WITH THE BREAKUP. WHAT'S MEANT TO BE WILL BE. AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. WHO KNOWS MAYBE WHEN WE ARE OLDER AND READY FOR WHAT WE PUT OURSELVES INTO MAYBE WE'LL GET BACK TOGETHER. BUT THE SCARY THING IS, IS MAYBE WE'LL NEVER SEE EACHOTHER AGAIN. MAYBE IT'S REALLY OVER! UP UNTIL RECENTLY I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF MYSELF WITHOUT HER. I EVEN CHANGED SCHOOLS FOR HER! I WAS GONNA GO TO MIAMI TO JOHNSON AND WALES AND THEN BECAUSE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP I TRANSFERRED TO PROVIDENCE J&W. NOW I AM QUESTIONING WHY I TRANSFERRED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I DON'T KNOW WHY I WOULD HOLD MYSELF BACK! I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M BOUT TO BOUNCE!!

"event","Yeah i know i haven't updated in a while but that's because i've been busy! Me and my ex girl are on bad terms right now because i don't wanna be with her cause actions speak louder than words and her actions are showing that she don'y wanna be with me! she does a lot of things out of revenge and she likes hurting me and i just can't deal with it anymore and she's finally getting on my last nerves and i don't wanna be around her! It got to the point where she said she's gonna start seeing other people and i honestly don't give a fuck because i need to move on with my life and THAT part of my life needs to finally needs to end because i can honestly say that being with her has been the worst part of my life because she is the most selfish person i've ever met and it has been very painful for the most part for the both of us cause i'm not tryin to say everything is her fault but she had a lot of power to change each and every situation but she didn't. She made it very hard for me to stay in love with her. Our relationship was so difficult and it really didn't have to be like that and like i wrote a lot of the situations good of gone good or bad but she almost always chose for it to go bad! I don't even know why she's tryin anymore because i've moved on and i've been happy with her being otu of sight out of mind. Being with her for 4 years, we have so much history and honestly that will probably be the hardest... STARTING ALL OVER!! Fuck it i'll say it ""I'm so scared to be without her"", I don't know anything else. Since i've been 16 she's all i know, she's the only girl i've been with and i'm gonna take evrything that i've learned from this relationship and become a better person for the next!"

"event","i mean i know i said me and my girl are gonna be together forever and nothing  wil break us up but u know when there is something questionable that happens and u just fucking hate them and wanna kill them? well that was what last night felt like! since we got together i have not thought of myself without her but she be pushing it! there would be no me without her! that was how i used to think but now it seems like i'm tryin to let go more than i'm tryin to stay. but i guess u can say i'm scared to let go cause she's all i've known for 4 years. and to tell u the truth i really deep down inside don't wanna be without her she's been my everything for so fucking long i don't know nothing else. she's my baby. i just have to learn to put myself first. plus my girl is the flyest nigga in MA. i'm serious, no joke!!"

"event","What's good this ur girl Angeleena 
  Yo this weekend was very hactic. Can a chic go to the club and not have a headache by the end of the night? Hell nah it aint happening!! And i was feeling nice and my own nigga had to start shit so i had to handle her real quick and almost got thrown out the club by some bouncer. But i don't know bout going to the gay club anymore cause bitches be real corny. 
  But off that. I hate gettin all crazy. Not being able to control my anger is a bad thing. I have to work on that. 
  Me and my wife(Jasmine) have been together for 4 years. There has been ups and downs like every relationship, but we're soulmates and we ain't leaving eachother for nothing."

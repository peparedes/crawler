After much deliberation, I've decided it's probably in my best interest to get rid of Livejournal.  I discovered last night I've had it since 2003, and it's just time to let it go.  I only keep it because of one person, and I'm just not really caring anymore.

I will delete this within the next few days, so I guess if you want to keep in touch with me, let me know."

"event","I've pretty much concluded that I'm not going to like this summer as much as I thought I was going to.

The camp that Craig is working for seems to be taking over his life.  He might have to drop his online summer class because of it, which is crap.  It screws up his schedule for next year (fall and possibly spring), and yeah.  I don't know.  I guess he's right when he says that it took over his life last summer... the only difference was I wasn't here in the middle of it all.  Hopefully it gets better as the summer progresses, but we'll see.

As for me, I'm doing alright.  For those of you who didn't know, I got a job on the newspaper here at SIUC, the Daily Egyptian, as the Asst. Editor of the city desk.  Today was my first day, but this entire week is basically just a boot camp, so to speak.  Like today, for instance, I listened to four of the ""uppers"" talk for 3ish hours about libel, how to be an editor, the editing process, ledes, etc... nothing too exciting.  Kind of boring, actually, but needless to say, informative.  I learned that only 9 campuses in the US have their own printing press, and SIUC is one of them.  I knew we had one on campus, but I didn't know we were one of 9... cool, huh?

I start my first summer class next Monday, and then I don't start my second one until July.  In the meantime, I believe Nancy is going to try and come visit me some weekend, and Jessica and Kim are going to come down another.  Hopefully all of that works out, because I really miss my friends...

Anyway, I think my stomach has finally calmed down, so I'm going to bed..."

The move into the apartment went rather smoothly.  It was kind of rough at first getting all of the incredibly massive stuff in, but after that part was over it worked out well.  I love my apartment, and I love being here.  It's actually fun living with Craig too.  I figured that it would be weird, but it's not.  I love seeing him every day!  :) It's going to be great.  I know it!

The semester is finally over, and it went well.  My grades ended up how I figured they would, so I'm very pleased.  I start summer school in like 3 weeks, so in that time, I'm going to go home for a week or so and see my friends that are mad at me since I'm staying in Carbondale all summer *:(*, but it'll be a fun week. :)

Anyway, Verizon Wireless is calling my name... in other words, I have to go see them to up my minutes and such.  Maybe if more of my friends got Verizon, I wouldn't be having this issue... haha!  Just kidding, it's my own fault."

"event","So I last updated this over a month ago, so I guess it's time to let everyone know what's been up...

I've been working hella all summer at the pool and at Claires.  Other than that, I've been hangin' out with my friends (okay, mostly Kim, Kelly, and Jessica, but still.)  A lot of time has been spent at Tj's or Jessica's drinking.  On Saturday night, it was Margarita night, so me, Kim, Jess, Tj, Zane, Rob, Clint, and Tyler all went to Tj's, had some beer and margaritas, and swam.  It was great fun.

As for other things that have went on... Craig came home for a night in July, and then the next weekend I went down to Carbondale for the weekend and came back on a Monday.  I got to see Craig (of course), Naci, Cynthia, Justin and Ara.  And I also saw a lot of people from church, and I made a couple new friends.  Yay!

This saturday, I'm going to a Cubs game with Janet and her family.  Then, on the 12th of August, I'm going to a Rascal Flatts concert with Kim and Kelly at the State Fair, and then the next day Craig and I are leaving for South Dakota from the 13th-18th, and then on the 20th I move back down to school.  I am soooo excited, I can't wait!  I actually have a single this year, so it'll be fun.  Kaitlin and Jill are in the single suites right above me, and then on the floor under them there's Craig, Justin, Justin, Richia, and lots more people.  I've got friends on the 10th floor and I have one or two on the 9th floor, and then yeah.  COULDN'T BE MORE THRILLED!!!

Oh, Craig officially comes home for the summer on August 8th.  I am SO EXCITED!  He won't get to see Jessica again before she leaves for Kentucky, but hopefully we'll get to go down and visit her during the school year so it'll be all good.  :)

Okay, I have some lunch waiting for me and then I have to get a shower (since I just got off work at the pool) and get ready to go work at Claires... great fun, I know.

Oh, PS, my name was pulled in the on-campus parking lottery... meaning I get to park on campus again.  Friggin' yay!!!!!!"

Not a whole lot's been goin' on lately.  Just gettin' back into the ""swing of things"" here in Decatur... working two jobs (Sun N fun for the 4th summer and Claires for the 2nd summer)... yeah, fun times, I know.  Oh, and hanging out with Kim, Kelly and Craig.  Sad thing is that Craig leaves for Carbondale for the summer this weekend, and I won't get to see him again until the weekend of July 8th when I go down there to visit him and my friends Justin, Cynthia, Teresa, Naci, and everyone else that's cool enough to go to school during the summer... oh wait, that's going to be me next year.  OoOoops... :)

That's really about it...

Oh, I'm going to a Cubs game on July 30th with Janet... and I'm going to see Rascal Flatts (for the second time) on August 12th at the state fair with Kim and Kelly... yes yes, I am super excited.  Rascal Flatts with my two best friends... what's better than that?! Oh, and when Craig comes back for a week and a half in August, he's staying with me... why, you ask?  Well, mostly because I guess he can't really stay with his grandparents in Heyworth, he doesn't want to rent, and his parents are going to be in their new home of South Dakota.  So yeah, I'm looking forward to that as well.  Chances are he'll end up going to the concert in August with us too since he'll be here, but who knows.  Only time will tell.

Well, I promised Craig I'd basically go right to bed since I was so exhausted, so I'm going to follow through with that... goodnight everyone.

There's no more air
Trippin' over myself
Goin' nowhere
Waiting
Suffocating
No direction
And I took a dive

And on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

I've been wondering why
It's only me
Have you always been inside
Waiting to breathe
It's alright
Sunlight
On my face
I wake up and yeah, I'm alive

'cause on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

I was so afraid
Of going under
But now
The weight of the world
Feels like nothing, no, nothing

Down, down, down
You're all I wanted
Down, down, down
You're all I needed
Down, down, down
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed

And I won't forget the way you loved me

All that I wanted
All that I needed

On the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget

"event","Somewhat eventful weekend...

Friday didn't really do much.  The boys and I went to Sonic's, then went to Walmart and bought ""Scene It"" Disney... and played it... and it was actually really fun, and funny because you'd think it was easy because it's Disney trivia basically, but some of the stuff was actually like wtf?!  haha

Saturday, I was just around the dorms until about 4 when the boys and I headed off to Fairview Heights to go to Gordmans and just do whatever other shopping we felt compelled to do... I only bought a sweatshirt from Old Navy and some perfume from Gordmans... blah... then we came back here and basically just crashed... OH, I got popcorn shrimp when we got back... haha

Today was homework and laziness... our church from 8:30-9:30, Denny's for breakfast, then Craig RA's church from 10:45-12... watched ""Little Black Book"" with Craig like waaaaaaay later... and then we talked for about 2 hours....

Bedtime..."

Tim called and woke me up around 10... then I was up until around noon while watching ""Without a Paddle""... paused it, though, because I knew I was going to fall asleep... woke up again a little before 3, and around 5:30 I decided to get dressed and do SOMETHING...

My mom made me cheese soup for dinner tonight... yummies!....and after that, me and Kelsey went to JoAnn Fabrics to get... well, fabric... to make me another blanket, then we went to Blockbuster to take videos back and then I got ""Jersey Girl"" and ""Along Came Polly""... then we went to DQ to get some ice cream...

Now it's storming, so that's about it.

Tomorrow... erm... today is not going to prove to be terribly eventful.  I have to go shopping for Cynthia's birthday party at 6, and pray that the weather isn't bad between 5-10 so that I can get to Champaign and back safely... and also, that I don't get lost... yeep... other than that... well, there is nothing else.

Eventually this week I need to go to the bank and finally deposit all this money that I have left over from Christmas, and I also need to go to the courthouse to pay my speeding ticket that I got the first freaking night I was home... damn those Maroa cops... I knew I shouldn't have went to Clinton that night, haha!  jk!

I sent an email to a lady that works in the Area Office for the towers to see when the absolute earliest was that I could go back to school... home... whatever you wanna call it.  Hopefully the answer is Friday or Saturday because I fear I will go nuts if I stay here until next Monday... bah... granted, I love being home, but there's only SO MUCH a person can do in this god-forsaken town.  I mean, let's look at it this way.  Over break, I've basically hung out with 5 people:  Craig, Craig RA, Tim, Kelly, and Kim.  Craig is already gone; he's in Monterrey, Mexico on a missions trip.  Craig RA is, well, an RA, so he's gotta be back Wednesday... Kelly is in high school still and so I can only really hang out with her on the weekends since she works practically every day of the week... Kim is going back on Wednesday to rush sororities... and Tim has to work, but he's also been really busy lately so I really haven't gotten a chance to hang out with him much... hopefully I'll get to see him again before I go back to school... I'm sure I will, though.

Anyway, I'm going to finish talking to my nocternal buddy, Scott, online and then I think I'm going to try to go to sleep... I'm actually feeling a bit... sleepy?"

Amanda came down to visit me over the weekend, and we had an awesome time.  We were mostly with Craig #4 (aka my old man) and Craig RA (aka mentor, haha).... it was just a lot of fun.

I'll be home for Thanksgiving on Friday sometime between 3-6.  Don't really know when, it depends if Craig decides to stop off in Greenville to see one of his friends.  Bah.

Not really much to say, actually.

Oh, I have to study for a test tonight.  And I get to eat Thanksgiving dinner at Trueblood.  Yay. :)

Okay I need to dry and straighten my hair... go me.

Love ya'll!"

"event","I looked in the mirror today
And I saw a reflection
Unfamiliar to those seen before
I realize now
I'm growing up
And becoming who I really am
I'm growing my wings
I'm learning to fly
I don't need your hand anymore
All I need is encouragement
To go where the wind
And where God
Choose to take me
Because I'll end up where
I'm supposed to be
With or without your help
I need to fly away
To my comfort zone
For a little while...
I will come back.
Have faith."

So here's my life as I know it...having a lot of regrets if I died right now.I keep thinking I don't have any regrets, but honestly, there is so many things I want to do before I die, like staying in contact with my best friends even if they are 3,000 miles away, loving your family no matter what, and living my life fully even if you don't have everything you've ever wanted. I have been realizing a lot about myself lately..things that I have never noticed before. I just started realizing that I am a very conservative person. Most things like abortion,homosexuality or racism  I am not against, but over all I think life should bery very old-fashioned like it was before. For one thing, I think todays singers are absolutely horrible compared to the 60s or 70s when being a singer didn't matter on money, but on talent. Those people could sing a note without having to be re-touched by are new high technology. Don't get me wrong, I love some groups and singers, but I think that whole industry should really change. I also think the fashion styles should be like how they were back then. They weren't showing off stomachs and wearing low-cut jeans and short shorts or mini skirts. I think we need to dress without showing a lot of skin because, I don't know exactly why, but I think it's more polite and I think it's just something that should happen because it's one of those things that is turning the US into a corrupt universe. People can dress the way they want to, but that is just what I think. I have even been driving lately! How exciting! I am going to take the test to get my permit next week! YAY! I am actually excited about this, That's why it's so weird. I think I needed to trust myself before I could drive. I think 15 and 16 is way to young to drive, and It's not like I am so much older than that, but you actually change a lot between 16 and 17...you grow up and I think people should wait longer because then it's not just the thrill of having freedom when you get your liscense, you learn to have respect for it and it will be less likely for car accidents if they are older and take more time to learn. My sister's always told me that I would eventually grow into wanting to drive and I never thought I would because it was never exciting to me, but it finally is now. And I'm good at it! Now I feel like I've taken a step to grow a little bit more. Learning to drive, I can get a car, drive myself to work, move out, go to college, and before you know it..we will all be grown up and living our own lives. I can not wait!"

Pride can stand a thousand trials
The strong will never fall
But watching stars without you
My Soul cries
Heaving heart is full of pain
The Aching,
Cause I'm kissing you,
I'm kissing you
Touch me deep, pure and true
Give to me forever
Cause I'm kissing you

There is this guy that I am falling for like crazy, and have been for the last few weeks. But how do you know if its real love, or just another crush? I mean i dont think im in love with him, but i know i like him a lot. But when does it get to the point where u can say that you more than like him. Everyone says that when you fall in love, you'll know because you get these feelings in the pit of ur stomach or you'll just know because hes your soulmate. Thats a little far-fetched. I mean when I like a guy i ALWAYS get that happy feeling in my stomach and i cant wait to see them the next day. They always make me smile and laugh. And i dont think there is one person that is perfect and is waiting for you. I think that any person can make you happy you just have to be able to make yourself happy to see it.It does make me feel better at times when im lonely to think that one special person is longing to hold me or something, but its not true.There's so many people in the world, and everyone is so different from each other, they can all make u happy in different ways.I guess im just love-struck or something. I mean this guy i like he makes me smile and laugh and i love flirting with him, but i think hes just a normal crush, but i want it to be more than that because i really really like him. Iono this is a confusing subject for me.I just wish we didnt have to search for love...so it would just come straight to us and none of this dramatic stuff would be going on, such as, he loves me, or he loves me not??

Today was restless. I found out I have some serious thinking to do about myself. I found out that one of the biggest problems i have in my life...is me. I can never deal with it, but i am my own bully. There r so many thoughts that went inside my head today that its hard to sort them out. I thought i got over this ""self-acceptance"" thing a long time ago, but it just comes back to haunt  me. I hate dealing with my own problems because it makes me sound arrogant and selfish. The worst word someone could ever call my is conseided, and i dont think i can even spell it! When i went to this class in las vegas last year which was a self acceptance class, i learned a lot of things, but nothing about myself, nothing about my problems, just what had made me mad growing up. It's hard to be this care free girl when i have no idea what i want, i dont know anything about myself. Which is really sad. I swear I'm not conceided I'm just hurt because one of the worst people i hate in the world- is me. I'm the only person who judges everyone and says all these things, i judge myself at everything i do, i control everything that is in this stupid head of mine, and I am the only person who can't tell anyone my secrets. I don't know why, but i can never have a conversation about me. I runaway anytime something gets serious because inside of me, its just this little girl who is trapped inside this Bitch's head. I would ask for help, but no one can give me anything or talk to me, cuz i wont. I am trapped inside this head and i might as well make it work. God, don't take this as an insult or anything like that, but i really need you to help me. I need to be healed by the angels...
P.S. to anyone who reads this- this is a personal letter, please don't say anything to anyone, if you have enough patience to read my journal, u have enough patience to keep it to yourself"

Wow there is just too many things to say in this journal entry and I dont wana bore people, so I will try not to give too many details. Boys, Boys, Boys, Boys, everyone knows me as boycrazy becasue u kno im in love with boys! But there r some things that seperate me from each of them. And well i met this guy who is so perfect to me in every single way. And even tho we had some past experiences, i still care about him no matter what. And i miss him more than anything.It's so hard to talk to anyone here because no one knows me as well as Chantal, and every one in vacaville. I feel so out of place here and when i say something funny, i feel so stupid because everyone that knows me would laugh just cuz knowing me, im pretty dumb and i make pretty careless jokes and im just a retard, but i guess that is just what is not exactly popular here, lol. Its ok tho because i like being original and different than every person in the school. I feel like im obligated to be attracted to guys here because im so far away from a ""certain"" person. But the more guys i think i would like here, the less i like them because its like i dont need any guy except that ""certain"" guy. But anyways back to the other things going on- yea, my dad, well what can i say except he is really making me mad. I mean my whole life is kind of a blur with him. And he's hurt me a lot i dont really know how to talk about my dad in way thats not offensive but not all daddys girl either u kno? I wish he could just see my life for one day and judge it from there, if he doesnt like the things i do then he has to deal with it and if he does, he can at least pretend to be a father for at least once in my life. Ok that was harsh...anyways
So herre is the 411 on the summer, if i go back to vacaville i will probably have an awesome time, but i just wont be able to say bye. I feel like everyone there has forgotten about me so if i go there hows that going to mean anything to them? I mean i dont want to go there and then end up spending all that time at Markus' house watching TV all day u kno? I want to stay allll summer, but i have to get a life here too or how else am i going to get thru senior year here in Virginia? It's been so hard here and i ahve to close in my feelings because there is no one who can even understand or even looks like they want to. That's why i wanted to start swimming. I can get my feelings out when im in the water, it makes me go faster. I feel like i can go on and on again except until i hypervenalate, and they call 911, lmao. Lol it was a weird thing to go thru. I was kind of elsewhere and i couldnt concentrate on breathing. BUt yea, thats over with!
I have to tell you my dreams, but I dont think i should talk for much longer sooo I will tell them next time. OMG finals r this week im gonna fail, its scary..eek! lol I guess thats it yall ill catch ya later!! Love u!

Today I went to Marine World as my goodbye party, and it was the funnest time I have ever had. It was so perfect and so fun and it is freaky how perfect it was. Now, I'm the type of girl that knows the difference between reality and dreams, but tonight, it was like my fairy-tale before i leave. I'll never forget any of it, and I'll never forget these people. They all mean so much to me and I wish I didn't have to leave.I found my Prince Charming tonight, lol, and he was even more charming than the fairy-tale one. It was like a dream and I'm so happy everyone could come. I'm glad I have these as memories especially all the roller coasters i rode! I'm so proud, I rode Medusa, Boomerang, Roar, Kiddie Coaster, Voodoo, Jambo, and even the fright fest!!! AHHH. And i wouldnt have worked up the guts to any of that without eric and dan. Thanx for making me do it! and I hope all of u had as much fun as I did! Have a spantabular night! and GoD Bless AMerica!

Wow it has been awhile since I have written escpecially since all the drama that is going on!!! Let's put it this way...I'm moving to Virginia...in like less than 1 week!!! And it's so horrible to say goodbye to all my friends I'm gonna miss soooo much here!!! Since that is the case, I haven't been doing ANY of my homework, and now this weekend I have to catch alllll up because they are gonna transfer the latest updated grades! this sux! And tomorrow I am going to Marine Worl with a few friends becasue i got some free tickets. And please oh please guys that i didn't invite...I am so sorry, but please don't be mad because i ran out of tickets and even though i didnt pick u doesnt mean i dont love u! I still love everyone and i hate it when these things come up because people always get mad at me, but i also know its my fault because i started telling everyone that we were going to the skating rink and i know i shouldnt hvae, but my mom said i could, and then she called me after school and said she got free tickets instead. So please guys dont ignore me or be mad becasue u can still come....just not free... but anyways, I'm writing a few people goodbye letters, unfourtuenetly I cant write everyone a goodbye because my hands dont work that well, sorry. I gave one to joanna already and..dan...but anyways. I hope everyone has a great life here, and even though it will probably be awhile before i see any of u again, i love u all, and god bless!!! GOODBYE

This is so hard to write back on this thing, I'm not very good at writing down my feelings because most of the time I never know what they are. School is getting so much better, I don't come home everyday saying it sucked and crying myself to sleep, but I actually smile and I'm thankful for everything. I know a lot of my friends and family don't believe there is a God or that christians suck and everything, but I pray everyday for every single person to be saved and feel like I do. I hate to think anyone I know would go to hell, I want everyone with me in Heaven where we can have a reunion for enternal life.    My mom is in Arizona today for another interview! And we find out this weekend where or if we are even moving. It's so weird to just think that in 1 week I could never see my best friends again. Sometimes I think moving will be good, but I'm just fooling myself, I hate the thought of moving. I wonder who my Prince Charming is? Just thinking about it makes me smile. Could it be Superman? or even Batman? or what about Mr. Snuggles, lol. I think that's the hardest part about moving.....forgetting about everyone here. I've had to move every single year in high school, when I moved here I thought my family would finally be happy, but, yet again, they aren't. I pary every night for every single person to be happy. I pray that every person has these amazing dreams that make them smile and make every person realize that their dreams can come true. I just want to shout out to my closest friends!

God Bless Alicia!
I'm sooo happy I finally finished all of my homework for once! I have my persuasive essay finished, but its a weekk and a half late..hehe..silly me. I can't help it if A LOT has been on my mind! You know I really wish teachers would go easy on us teenagers, I know they all thing were drama queens and all that...and we are, all this gossip and stupid stuff, but some of it is serious, and I just wish school could be easier for me right now..it's really wearing me out! I Love You! Remember everyone, GOD LOVES YOU!

I made a new screename today because I felt like I needed to be invisible to a few people that I know. I know that it's not very nice to ignore people, but at this point I don't really know what else to do. I'm moving. To either Virginia or Arizona and knowing that I have to move away from the only place I ever fit in makes me very sad. There is so much stress going on in my family...I just want OUT! The thing that makes me happy is that I have finally found God. And he is showing me where to go. Boys are confusing right now. I'm trying to think of my perfect boyfriend that I will be with in the future, but I can't stop thinking about the boys right now. I'm so jealous of one of my friends, she has everything, everything I've always wanted, and now she has the guy I've always wanted. And the sucky part about this is that it's making me feel like crap. Everyone is telling me to control my emotions and get over him, but I never can, he is on my thoughts every second and it's making me crazy. He has hurt me too many times, and I can't believe I'm right back at the place I started. SO that's why I changed my screename on AIM, so I can forget about this guy cause all he is gonna do is hurt me again. I'm not going to school for like this whole week, I'm going to concentrate on God and family, and as much as it hurts me to forget about this amazing person, I have to because if I don't I'll get hurt again. This guy is so perfect you have no idea. He is so nice, and sweet, and just so perfect for me, but the thing I will never forget is that If I do ever end up with him, I will never be able to make him feel the way he does for this other girl, who is one of my good friends. Maybe this place isn't a good palce for me anyways..nobody cares I'm mocing, nobody ever listens to me, and I've never felt so alone, that's why I need God. He is the only perrson I have to comfort me and If yesterday was the last day I saw any of my friends before I moved, as much as it hurts, I might just leave without a goodbye. I hate this, I hate it, I can't think about anything and when I do, I cry. I wish I could go to the past and act like I never even met this guy so he can be happier and I can be happier without me. This is all my fault he likes her, and I just wish I could have realized then how much my heart is broke now. Goodnight and sweet dreams to everyone and may God bless you so you can be so happy! I know that would make me happy!

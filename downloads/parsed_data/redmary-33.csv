( this is a pat on the back for me ). :) :) :) :) :)......i just want to sit and think all these stuff over and correct where i went wrong.......i haven't talked to kenneth yet. he called me&nbsp;but missed his call. he just left me a message. i want to talk to him but i don't know if he wants to talk to me. i feel as if i should keep myself away from him for a while because maybe he need the time. i don't know maybe its just my head messin with me.................</FONT></STRONG>"

"event","<P><U><FONT color=#339999>last night was a weird night. everything was planned out too soon. kenneth upset me but its ok because i understand he has skool. :(&nbsp; i saw paoje and it was weird too. he still makes me cry only when i'm with him. its ok though, i'm fine now. i hate how he try to keep me away from everything else. i was talking to one of my friend on the phone and he got mad or upset or whatever. he's too obssess and i just wish he was more open. first time in my life i kinda feel like i can't trust or turn to anyone because they won't know exactly how i feel. i feel like my family is mad at me because i haven't really been home and my friends are too busy with their boyfriends. i took a shower at frances house today i just feel like crying it all out. i feel so low all i want to do is just do nothing or get high and crash out so then i'll forget about everything. i feel lost inside and i don't know where to start or go. i guess i'm just confused. i think i'm havin too much fun that i'm forgetting about all the things that are really important to me as my family. i think i'm gonna stay home and spend more time with my family and stay out of trouble stuff. i'm gonna go hide away from everything and maybe the good things will come out....</FONT></U></P>"

"event","<P><EM>somehow i feel as if kenneth is tired of me. i don't know why but i feel like that. i saw him yesterday and he doesn't paid as much attention to me as when we are together by ourselves. yesterday we hung out at frances because it was steve's b day. kenneth was there and it was kool. i smoke infront of him which right now i wish i hadn't. i was hella high though, i mean HELLA HIGH! then i started to had the munchies and then i became very sleepy around 1am almost 2 and i crashed out on the couch. while i was sleeping all i remember was kenneth coming to me later and slept next to me. then i remember him getting up then gave me a kiss on the forehead telling me he had to go. then i crashed out deadly. next thing i remember it was 7:15am and bum was sitting by my feet. lol he fell asleep sitting down. it was kool last night. i had fun. my head kinda hurts but i'm ok. :)</EM></P>"

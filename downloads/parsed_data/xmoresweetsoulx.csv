Only to say -

EVERYONE COME TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY! 

When: Friday, October 21st.
Where: My/Jamie's apartment.
Why: MY 20TH BIRTHDAY! 

So my actual birthday is Thursday the 20th but...Friday will do.
It is in fact my golden birthday and I expect everyone to be there...
As long as you're invited. 
If I forgot you and you'd like to come...just let me know. 

Please bring yourself only...or let me know who you're bringing. 
We have a pretty small apartment to work with...so careful planning is necessary. Ha.

I'd imagine my co-workers can't wait until my birthday is over. It's written on every calendar in our office...and I mention it everyday. What can I say? I like my birthday.
2 days. 
Don't forget.
I certainly won't...

The week was entirely too long. 
Last night was fun. Jamie and I went shopping...and I bought a new piece! She's pretty...and remains nameless at the moment, but that will come with time. There was a party at Henry's, which turned out to be lots of fun. Quite a few fun people were there. Tonight...I'm not sure what's going on. The fify million people that currently live at my house...are ALL GONE! (until tomorrow) My sister is in Utah until the 1st...and my Dad and the rest are in College Station. Yay for the one quiet night at my house. I will be accompanied by my <i>lovely</i> Jamie, and possibly a few others. We'll see.

I finally got a raise!!! Which is really awesome...because now I don't have to find  new job. I've officially had this one for over a year now. :) I'm proud of that. 

Jamie's on her way :)"

Friday:
~Left work early.
~Met Bill for lunch and some hangin out.
~Had dinner with Jamie :) ...and proceeded to go to Brad's for another fun filled evening. 

Saturday: 
~Woke up hella early to follow my Dad to Burleson to get his car.
~Sat around...until Jamie came over. :) Once again...we proceeded to go to Brad's for an even <i><b>funner</i></b>...yes funner, night. Living Room Baseball. Illegal substances. Tony Hawk...all great.
We decided to head over to Janelle's around 12...which, after all the excitement I'd had, wasn't so fun. I was a little drained. We didn't stay long...and ended up going back to Brad's...and left there shortly after. We decided to go to my house to hang out for a little longer...and there was nobody home. My dad and his g/f arrived shortly after we did...so we watched Clueless! ...kinda. We were both pretty tired (me more so than Jamie) and I started falling asleep. Ultimately, she ended up staying overnight and it was all greatness. 

Now...I need to shower. I feel icky. 

I hope everyone's weekend was as good as mine! :)"

cradling the softest, warmest part of you in my hand
feels like a little baby bird fallen from the nest
i think that your body is something i understand
i think that i'm happy, i think that i'm blessed

i've got a lack of inhibition
i've got a loss of perspective
i've had a little bit to drink
and it's making me think
that i can jump ship and swim
that the ocean will hold me
that there's got to be more
than this boat i'm in

'cuz they can call me crazy if i fail
all the chance that i need
is one-in-a-million
and they can call me brilliant
if i succeed
gravity is nothing to me, moving at the speed of sound
i'm just going to get my feet wet
until i drown

and i teeter between tired
and really, really tired
im wiped and im wired but i guess its just as well
because i built my own empire
out of car tires and chicken wire
and i'm queen of my own compost heap
and i'm getting used to the smell

and i've got a lack of information
but i got a little revelation
and i'm climbing up on the railing
trying not to look down
i'm going to do my best swan dive
into shark-infested waters
i'm gonna pull out my tampon 
and start splashing around

'cuz i don't care if they eat me alive
i've got better things to do than survive
i've got a memory of your warm skin in my hand
and i've got a vision of blue sky and dry land

i'm cradling the hardest, heaviest part of me in my hand
the ship is pitching and heaving, my limbs are bobbing and weaving
and i think this is something i understand
i just need a couple vaccinations for my far-away vacation
i'm going to go ahead and go boldly because a little bird told me
that jumping is easy, that falling is fun
up until you hit the sidewalk, shivering and stunned

and they can call me crazy if i fail
all the chance that i need
is one-in-a-million
and they can call me brilliant
if i succeed
gravity is nothing to me
moving at the speed of sound
i'm just gonna get my feet wet
until i drown...</c>"

I found it to be uplifting in every way possible.

<c>BEAUTY 

For attractive lips, speak words of kindness. 
For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people. 
For beautiful hair, let a child run their fingers through it once a day. 
For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone. 
People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed,revived, reclaimed, and redeemed; never throw out anyone. Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of each of your arms. As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands; one for helping yourself, and the other for helping others. 
Beauty comes with time, age and wisdom.

Work was slow, so I finished and came to pick her up...I decided that she should have her first driving lesson with me. (The couple with my dad didn't go so well.) She drove from our house to our old neighborhood and did well! :) 

I did something over the weekend that made me feel 100% better about a certain situation. *High Five* to myself for that. :)

The weekend was good...

Friday~ Saw Corey's <b>awesome</b> play with Jamie and Kristy! Yay for fun people. :) 
Saturday~ I slept until 3. Did a few things. Went to Coffee Haus and then to Jeff's party! The party was...interesting, to say the least...but definitely fun. 
Sunday~ Sunday's are always horribly uneventful for me...meh.

As for today...

I think I'm going to:

~Do a few things around the house.
~Smoke and listen to some rockin' music.
~Spend another lovely evening at Coffee Haus with wonderful people...and my guitar. 
~Maybe get Chinese food with Jamie? MOTUMBO, YOU SHOULD GO TOO! It's more fun that way, I promise. :)

I get paid tomorrow, rather than Friday, and I'm SO excited. In addition to that, I get a bonus. A bonus that I found very amusing, in terms of the amount. I'm not complaining by any means. Money is money and I sure as hell need it...

I got my tragus pierced!! both ears :) That makes 18 holes, officially. I think I'm really done with piercings this time. This one was definitely a little on the painful side. I was only gonna do one...because I didn't think I could handle both in one night, and then there's the sleeping issue. But my buddy in College Station always gives me good deals :) so I couldn't resist. $35 each...or both for $50. Duh. 

Josh and Alan weren't at Coffee Haus tonight. I was horribly disappointed. However, Bill took it a little harder than I did. Pull out of that depression yet, kid?
I love my life. 

Here's the deal...I need some advice...

There's this boy...that I've known for quite a while. He used to live in Hurst and is currently in the Marines, so he's in Japan. He calls me on a regular basis and totally has a thing for me. I wouldn't consider the feeling mutual, primarily because he's there...and I'm here, obviously. Be that as it may...it's not what I need the advice on, but I thought I'd present the situation. Anyway...The other day he called me just to chat, I suppose. He asked me if I liked music boxes and I told him that I loved them. He explained that he was out the other day and saw this music box and for some reason...he just had to get it for me because it reminded him of me...or something. He also wanted to get me something authentic from Japan..and this is, so it works. He told me he would send it shortly after Christmas because apparently it's hard to send shit out around Christmas. I talked to him again today and he mentioned the fact that his grandparents sent him this big box full of stuff for Christmas...and now he had a box to put my music box in...however, the box was too big for just that...so now he's going to fill it up and then send it. <b> WHAT THE HELL DO I GET THIS BOY?? </b> I seriously don't have the slightest clue...help, please?

Yay for my mini music theory lesson tonight :) I'm determined to learn it thoroughly. I didn't get a chance to ask my dad for the book for christmas...so I think I might just buy it tomorrow.

I'm extremely bored. I can't really think of anything to do...that I actually wanna do.

Meh.

I applied for a job at Sally's. I reeeally reeally reeeally wanna work there. That and my other job would be great! I could move out...<b> soon! </b> Jerry(my current boss) is my number one reference and I know he would say nothing but good things about me. :) I have cash register skills from Super Cuts...that's a plus. I wasn't sure how relevant it was but they had a question about software I was familiar with and I got to put Quickbooks on there! I was excited. Bill is probably the only person who understands that. heh. I've also had my current job for 7 months...so that's a fairly good amount of time. Cross your fingers...or something.

I might not get to go see Josh tomorrow night at Coffee Haus. :( My dad's g/f asked if I would drive her to College Station and take Monday off...meaning we leave Sunday afternoon. Josh plays at 8. I might cry. I think I'm just gonna tell her that I don't have the money to be going out there. And I need an oil change before we go...and I certainly don't have the money for that. I might still take monday off :D

Band practice was eh. We don't get anything done...it's more fun now, but we still get nothing done. How are we supposed to play a show when we can't finish writing our songs? or people can't practice 2 days in a row?

I had a bad memory of how dumb we(people my age..i guess) used to act around boys when we were younger.
It was kinda funny. heh.

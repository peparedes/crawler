"event","i feel like i can never do anything right and i cant find the right guy but you can and you don't need to die just go back with bud and you'll be happy again but me i'm going to be that loser that just goes on the dates with their friends or stays at home and never gets asked out by a really cute guy who is nice and will die alone and depress and will always have time to them self and can always go out with there friends thats what i'm going to end up like no that's not what that was all about that's just why i really hate my life and we still have to sit down and talk about that face to face you know i mean i wouldn't mine but i really just need time to be me with out a b/f not saying that all guys should go fuck themselves or anything like that im just going though a lot and found out that this guy who was all over me never really wanted anything to do with me so now i feel like a slut and i just hate myself and i just realizes that who im really am is a slut so i really im myself so what am i talking about i am the biggest slut you have ever known 
  
I used to think I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always go my way
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize

CHORUS

I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

CHORUS - repeat

But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way

CHORUS

(I'm not a girl) I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman) I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time) Oh, all I need is time
(A moment that is mine) That's mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl, not yet a woman, no no
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl, ooh
Not yet a woman"

"event","Jross, you said Christianity was like a cult because:

""Four main reasons:

dependence on leader

Compliance with group's dress/jargon/ rituals

avoiding thoughts which contradict the cult

and a de-vauluing of the opinions of non-believers...

christianity does all of these..

not to mention it was referred to as a cult when it first began""

We depend on God because he made us, he is all knowing and all powerful, why wouldnt we depend on him? We dont have rituals, If you love someone you dont consider it a ritual to show your love to them or take intrest in them. I love God and I dont read my Bible cause someone stands over me and comands me to, I pray to God all the time, If you love someone you would want to talk to them all the time too. I believe God created me and sent his son Jesus to die on the cross for me, wanting to have a personal relationship with someone who did all that for me is not considered being in a cult. I don't de-valuate the opinions of others, and other christians shouldnt either. I value everyones opinion, doesnt mean I agree with it or I believe it for myself, but I definatly dont think less of someone for what they believe. Christianity doesnt do all of these, you say it does but you yourself dont take the time to listen then to what we have to say. For one I know you believe that homosexualtiy is not a sin, and although I do believe it is a sin, its not right for you do say I'm de-valuing your opinion when I have alot of Gay/bi-sexual friends who share the same opinion as you. I don't agree with it, but I dont think less of you as a person because you do. I don't stop hanging out with people who don't dress the same as me, or act the same as me. I'm friends with alot of different types of people, with different styles, opinions, and ideas, and I respect them all, and I get respect from them even if they don't share the same beliefs as me. Being a Christian doesn't just mean im ""religious"" it means I have a personal relationship with God. Its not fair to judge all Christians the same and say we are all a part of a cult."

"event","wow some people are just plain GAY . . . beyond belief. I dont understand it, I thought I wanted this, but now I don't. I can never make up my mind, but whats done is done and I cant take it back. I don't feel mad about it, just regret it a bit. GAY all of it, some times I actually feel sick, not with an emotion of jelousy, anger, sadness, hate, being annoyed or any other negative emotion, it's just GAY to the max where I feel sick from all the GAY wow anyways onto something better . . . 
I love holly, she is amazing and she is the only one who makes me love life so much. Shes such a happy person ""Holly why are you so happy?"" ""ahh I love my mom"" haha apparently I don't have to know how to sew because I'm such a good poet I'm going to write book for a living. And she knows how I find things Gay and so I will take her advice, ""to relieve your anger, run around naked"" sounds good . . . 
I hope I get to see B!lly one day soon, hes always busy with homework now that exams are here, and he works every school night {except wednesday} so that is the only day he can do it and thats when we hang out :( GAY, wow see everything and everyone is GAY today
PEOPLE are lyers, they say things and try to convince themselves of it but everyone knows they are lying . . . Like when someone says they love you, and you tell them they don't and then in a few weeks they are over you {clearly it wasnt love} or when you say you are still someones best friend and you know your not, but you still use the title, or when you say you care about someone but your actions show differently then your words, or when you only show you care when you are with someone but as soon as you are away things all seem so differnt . . . yea thats GAY
GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY
ok im done

"event","So me and drummer boy talk alot now, well not alot alot but more then before. Kinda funny cause i hard core stalked him before i had a b/f and i liked him soo much, then when i got put on placement for leadership, i ended up in his english class. thats how i found out he was in grade 9 and not grade 12 like i thought haha ahh well its all good. hes super cool. today at lunch was GAY, Mike, a random guy that came outa no where and started hanging out with my friends started to molest me. EWWW hes one of those guys that no matter what just gives you the creeps, and he wouldnt stop touching me, gah it was annoying and disturbing all at once. . .  AGH im scarred for life. 
anyways nothing too exciting happened today . . . im quite angry, see i went out with this guy and after we broke he moved up north and we decided to be best friends in the whole world,  And i have an amazing friend who i love so dearly named stevie, i introduced them together and THEY ARE FREEKIN IN LOVE NOW, and hes going to kidnap her and shes gunna move away with him, so not only did my best friend move away on me, but now hes taking another close friend of mine with him!!!!! PFT whatev. they can have each other and ill move on, make new friends while they are happy together. OR ill kidnap stevie before he gets to her and ill lock her in a box and he will have no stevie and she wont get her fairy tale ending lol ill just let her read books about it and that should be good enough
So i found myself a new person to stalk, not cause i like him in that sorta way just cause i think hes adorable, once again in grade nine lol my little drummer boy franny {francis} im commin for ya . . ."

So after they got stoned I learned from Kyle that Bob Marley is gunna be dug up and his body is gunna be shipped to Ethiopia. so i says to kyle i says 'but kyle Bob didnt speak in clicks, he wasnt born in Ethiopia' so he says to me he says 'ETHIOPIANS DONT SPEAK IN CLICKS!!! its a combination of clicks AND tones' haha i swear we fought him on everyhting he said but he had himself convinced. . . his friend also secretly likes Hilary Duff hes going to the concert but 'he didnt buy the ticket, he got it for free' pft yea ok . . ."

At around 11 we went to the bowling alley to meet up with everyone {Jross, Tosh, Justin, Rory, Jonathan, Emo Adam, Mike, Theo} we stayed there till 2 in the morning bowling, rock climbing, go karting, playing games and riding bumper cars. It was sweet, I've never bowled so much in my life. Me and Kittin had a race rock climbing and i got my butt whipped, i did alright the first time but my arms were so sore from this spinning ride thing we went on, so i kept falling {vanilla this is war} 
At 2:30 we went out for food before going to the church. When we got to the church we played my favourite game ever!!!! MAN HUNT!!!! until 5 in the morning, it was amazing cause we played in the dark and i fell down random stairs that appeared out of no where, and i got rug burn h-core when i got caught and refused to move and then i was brutally dragged up the stairs and down the hall {shakes fist in goodyears direction} hahaha After we played i sat behind a food table with Brittany eating all the food i could lol then i got pretty sick. After all that we watched Pirates of the Caribian. And all the people {which werent too many} that fell asleep got pranks pulled on them. We ate breakfast and then left the building at around 10, it was a pretty decent night hanging out with all my friends and all chillin together. MmMmMmM yes it was a good time. But now im so freakin tired, I've been awake for 35 hours and am ni some need of sleep."

so my birthday was on the 24th, i started the morning by buying all my Christmas gifts for people cuz i hadnt done any shopping. when i came home my family, some relatives and my boyfriend came over and we had cake and i got gifts and the usual birthday routine happened. from Billy i got my 2 favourite DVD's The Labrynth, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. He also got me 3 bags of candy and this sweet braclette. The rents and other fam got me money, more jewelery and an MP3 player. it was excellent. . . and all day i felt special cuz random ppl called me, a few of these people include: Elise, Toshia, Theo/Justin, and Goodyear {who actually sang the FULL OUT happy birthday song to me lol} it was grand. For Christmas we went to my grandparents house, they like us better then the other grandkids so while our cousins got socks, gift cards for the mall, choclate, and some money, we got ALL of that plus they gave me an extra 30$ and an extra $60 gift card for a c.d store, AND a 2 in 1 DVD/VHS player. haha it was awesome. . . Its really Lyndsay they love so if i wasnt her sister i would probably be treated as lower classity as well . . ."

"event","well my weekend was excellent, i went to Stevies house and we watched dogeball {so freegin funny i loved every minute of it} ""i like pumkins too . . . cotton"" and then we went to a church play, then came home and watched some more t.v and just chilled out for a bit, then we went to bed. We woke up and ate tons of ice cream for breakfast and then watched Chris Rock lol i laughed my ass off during that too . . . then we went to the mall and attempted to find silky boxers or a random good dvd but we failed and ended up in the food court lol it was a grand time. 
I went home and then Jordan and Kevin came over with my birthday present {Sally} so awesome. . . and we watched wizard of oz 2, craziness. . . after they left i walked to pcik up my birthday present in the freezing cold, dark night all be my lonesome self. when i got home i was an ice cube its been almost 35 minutes and my hands are still purple. 
So my night got a little crazier, i found out something from a friend. {extremely personal} so it wont be mentioned but i dont know what to do, i want to help her soo much and i will try my best but this is extreme. i made a plan, sortof, i just need to make a few calls, and plan a good time for the both of us . . . i know things are crazy for you now but you helped me soo much an i will do whatever i can to help you.
Speaking of help . . . a big thank you goes out to Laura Killian- you helped me alot and you were there for me when i needed you the most. You didnt care about how others would react to the advice you gave me, you said what needed to be said because you truely care about how i feel and thats more important to you then just trying to please others. I know because of it people said some stuff to you and it made you really upset, i just want to say screw any of those hostile pricks because i love you more then anything and you did so much for me and without you i was pretty damn lost. Thank you."

I'm trying to put myself in everyone's shoes to figure out how they all feel and what its like for them and now for myself im trying to figure out ""how im SUPPOSED to feel"" instead of just lettign myself feel what i really feel. im trying to force certain emotions and its not working and now its totally blocked out all other emotions. i hate emotion. maybe its a good thing i cant feel. 
ok finished with random rambling and i dont think it helped at all . . . but since i cant feel i couldnt tell ya . . . i feel dazed, finally some sort of feeling in me. . ."

well then i get home and suddenly everything changes, i think my best friend hates me, it sucks i dont know why but he cant tell me and it seems like all these negative emotions keep building up, setting walls between us, which makes it even worse then the three hours . . . i dunno he thinks there is something wrong with me too and maybe hes right, i can feel it, sortof, i just dont know what or why and well . . . i dunno. I dont feel mad or angry i just hate knowing im responsible fo someone i care about to feel so upset and angry and all the many other emotions"

NOT! im freegin mental sometimes. whatev no big deal, i dont freak out to other people, just to my online journal, the only safe place to freak out. so today at school i had to bring in my grandma for photography class to do a character portriat, it was so good lol shes grand, and shes so old and cute haha shes like 3 feet tall and she looks like an umpa lumpa. i love it. so i dont know what im gunna do this weekend. probably drop by the mall to see wanda when she goes with phin and nell, and im going to church in port on sundee, should be good. im excited. yea thats about it. . .

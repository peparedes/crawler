"event","Guess what. Live Journals are pretty close to homosexual. Because what a journal is is really a diary. And if a male keeps a diary it's what most people refer to as ""faggotry"". If a female keeps one, then they must be 12 years old. Stop wasting your time with these damned things. Seriously. They're stupid. You all deserve to fucking die. If I ever update this, it will probably be to tell you how worthless you are and/or how much you should just FUCKING DIE."

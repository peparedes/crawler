"event","There's this group on Facebook called ""Liberals, We Hate You."" Normally, I wouldn't give a fuck about such one-sided groups, but I saw that this girl I work with joined it. So I looked at the front page out of curiosity. There's this one brainwashed fuck who keeps posting shit like ""most of the people in this country are in favor of kicking towel-headed asses,"" ""I remember my days of elementary school...nobody talked about boys liking boys because it was and still is wrong,"" ""I can't imagine how shitty it would be to live in another country,"" and other similarly narrowminded, racist, homophobic, ""patriotic"" bullshit. Oh, and the grammar, spelling, and typing was atrocious. Naturally.

At first, I was pretty pissed off, but then the anger subsided into a slight depression. I already knew some fucked up people hold such opinions, but to actually see someone openly say this shit was still disturbing."

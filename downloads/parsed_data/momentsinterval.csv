"event","Ok, as promised...or not promised, but mentioned, in my <a href=""http://onoe.livejournal.com"">journal</a>, I'm making a new entry. Nothing special...just one of those random picture things. I was looking through my summer pictures because I felt like it. Actually it was so I could find a nice picture of a pier to paint. I came across some pretty pictures, so I shall post them. I find, especially right now, that in the winter with all the white everywhere, ground and usually sky, I forget how beautiful the summer is. So colourful. During the summer however, you don't notice it so much. It's real interesting.
I'm more of a sun set photographer, so there's a lot of sun set pictures, but I also love night pictures, so there's some of those too. =D
<lj-cut text=""Pictures"">
I have a couple winter ones for fun. I'll start with them.

I'm facinated with negative mode. I was looking at these two pictures and noticed how the icicle doesn't really change at all. It really wants to be the focal point too..
Enough with the white though...bleh. I've had enough of it anyway...still tons outside. Sigh...
These two were taken at my parents house.
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=S6002254.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6002254.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
It sure is.
Oh hey! I managed to find it!(the below picture)

So over used now. Oh Simpsons..

Sometime's at a certain time of day...usually at a certain time of year too, now that I think of it... Err....the sun hits the Elms in such a way that they turn red like this....or there's some kind of awesome colour effect that I haven't yet managed to capture. I got this one though. I think it's koool. =)
Taken outside my house, a few houses down.

Ok, those were kind of my more random pictures. The next are the ones I was really looking at. The lake ones.
First of all...
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=S6002904.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6002904.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Ahh... The stupid swing ruins it, but this picture...feels like home. Heh....in a few months it <i>will</i> be home. That will be my front yard almost. Actually the yard ends at the bush that tree is coming out of, but... dhsl;sdfl;kl; That's MY park. My pier... Mine.
Taken, obviously, on the front steps of my cottage.

Niiiiiiiiight pictures. My love. I said I was a sun set photographer, but I really think my photography belongs to the night.
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=S6003146.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6003146.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Oh ho ho! I prized this picture the night it was made.
Taken on the pier outside my cottage. August long weekend? I think that's when the guy does them.. A licensed man to the south of us seems to have a party that weekend every year with real fireworks. No dinky roman candles.
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=night.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/night.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Looking at the same spot, just a different night and different light source. I love it when small light makes sillouettes like that...if I speak grammar good. Err...that is, I'm not sure if what I said about sillouettes made sense. I like the picture, there.
Also taken on the pier outside my cottage.
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=S6003143.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6003143.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Another of that same spot. I apparently have fun with lighting on that outcrop of land.
Taken on the pier.
Let's look the other way now.
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=S6003092.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6003092.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Mmmm.... It's a little blurry, but I love how the colour streaks out from behind the land like that It's almost like the land has a light of its own. It's shining.
Taken on the pier outside my cottage. This time facing north..not south like the three above.
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=S6003139.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6003139.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Don't have much to say about this one. It sort of speaks for itself if you listen. Love those clouds. Something about it makes the picture feel like a tunnel or something. Or like you're looking between the slices of bread that make up a sandwich.
Taken on the peir.
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=S6003138.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6003138.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Looking straight out across the lake. You can see the cell tower lights. Cell and radio I guess.. Err...tower lights. Unless it was taken during the first week of July... Then it's likely that the two brighter lights are fireworks. It's a big lake and you often can't see the other side, but on Canada day/July 4th, you can see all kinds of light activity.
Taken on the peir.
This next one I took this past summer, and, though it doesn't look like much, I was and am quite happy with it on an artistic level. Simple, but full of lines and the pier sort of draws your eyes to the center. I'd paint this one if I thought I could get those colours with my paints.
Taken on the beach across the street from my cottage.

Same day, obviously, by the sky. Love the pastels.
Taken in the park across the street from my cottage.

Waaaves. Looks shalow to me...does it look shallow to you? Maybe that's just because I know that it IS shallow. I suppose what I mean is that it looks solid. Maybe I really think that it looks deep but solid enough to walk on? My mind can't make itself up. I ramble.

My camera likes playing tricks where, if I take several pictures of the same thing, and I usually do, it decides to change the colour of what it's seeing. Not sure which one is real, if either..
<a href=""http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/?action=view&amp;current=IM000389.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/IM000389.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Same thing, just a closer veiw of the tip of the point.
All three taken on the pier.

And, this is the last of my randomish picture show.
Taken on the pier, looking towards the beach/park. Well...on the left is the park. The treed area belongs to a guy who was caught growing pot. He's not very social. I'm not sure if anyone in the village really knows him. No doubt the most nosy do. He has a loud dog. Sometimes when it's loose, I throw it sticks.
As for the picture, I love the brightness of the yelow. This picture would be nothing without it.

Whee! I didn't get many of land and none of actual things. I guess this entry was devoted to shapes and colours more than...things. Next time, I'll have objects. It'll be more interesting than birds though. =P
Maybe next time I'll have my painting up here...eh heh.. I don't know about that. We'll see. I've only got two so far. Well...one and a half.
Anyway... Whee, pictures. Hope you liked them. I'm off to bed. Goodnight. =)"

Yes, my new obsession, and finally I've gotten around to posting a bit of what that obsession is. I've been making a collection of bird pictures. Usually if I haven't gotten a picture of a species or maybe I have but I feel like taking another...every bird I see and can, I take a picture of. I don't know where it came from, I just started doing it. I guess it happened when I saw an Oriole in a tree. My mom likes them and we always thought an Oriole sighting was rather rare, so I took a picture of this Oriole...actually there were two, as you will see, and I kept taking pictures of it; following it around. I then started taking pictures of other birds. Well, here's what I have so far. I do get carried away with these entries. ^^;; Enjoy.

The picture that started it all. I know I said it was the Oriole...that was when the serious bird stalking started but this one, a robin(I know it's hard to see), was the first robin of the year so I got excited cause it meant that spring really is here, so I had to take a picture of it. Then I saw the Oriole and the real stalking began.
Of course, this was taken a few weeks ago so I do know that spring is here, but that was my first robin and robins are spring birds. They're also one of my favorite birds for some reason. Hop hop hop. ^^
Hmmm...I guess I should keep the species together... This could get tricky.

It's not the same robin but I think this is where the bird ""stalking"" came from. I saw this robin from my yard though it was across the street in my neighbours yard and started taking pictures of it through the bush. I felt like a stalker, hence ""bird stalking"".

I didn't realize that these are all kind of the same.. I had other pictures that weren't...oh well.

I think this one was actually taken on the road. I had come out of hiding and crossed our bridge for a better picture.
Mmmm.....robins. Hop hop.

Grackles. I think the next few are also grackles but I'm not too sure.

Wow, lots of grackles.This one might be a grackle too and I know it's not a good picture at all but I had to give it recognition because it was the only one of this bird and it felt like it wanted to be shown off. No more ugly grackles. They're actually not that ugly but they remind me too much of crows and crows are noisy. =P

I think this and the following are Killdeer...but there are a few different kinds at the lake that look alike but aren't all Killdeer.

I think this cute little one is some kind of thrush or sparrow. It was very cute and hopped around in the bush.

Not sure what these next three are. The second had a neat looking tail though it didn't show in the picture, and I think the last one is called a water bomber....

Actually I don't know what these ones are either but they're the ones I talked about in my journal a couple of days ago. I think the yellow one is a male and the white ones, though you'll only really notice one cause I never got them all together, are female. There were at least five white ones but only one yellow. They kept jumping up into the air as tough they were catching bugs..so I think they might be some kind of Flycatcher.

Here's my first pelican picture. I was unlucky with this one. Today however, I got the break I needed and took these! =)

Mwaha! I haven't shown my mom yet. I should put them on her computer and make it the desktop wallpaper. She'd flip. She loves pelican's too. Oh yeah! I forgot the last one which is the real first pic of pelicans that I took.

They fly in a v. So smart. So fast too. ;__; This is a majorly zoomed in pic. Actually they all are, which is why they're all such bad quality pictures but...this picture is taken faaaaaaaaaaar away. I'm also just starting my hobby....still learning. =(
Ok...I think the only one left, other than the Great Blue Heron that rarely comes around and so I haven't had a chance to catch yet, is the Oriole. Best for last. Actually I think the Pelican is best but I rambled about the Oriole before...and if it wasn't for the Oriole...none of this could have been made possible. Actually credit should go to the robin but if I hadn't seen the Oriole in all it's ""rare""ness...though I see them all the time now because I know their call, I wouldn't have started taking pictures of all the other birds. Ok, Orioles.

And I think that's it for the Orioles...though I do have a lot more if you want them. >=)
Now for the artsy kinda ones.

I don't know how this is artsy really.. It's one of those birds I don't know what they are but think are flycatchers.. I took it cause I saw the bird standing still on a rock but when I looked at the pick after if was all.. hey, that's kinda koool with the random bush thing so centered and the waves and dlgksdjklas so it's not an artsy pic.
All my art pics are random pics by the way...not planned. As if I could plan an artsy pic...

And this one is my love. It's just perfect...except the main Turn in the pic isn't very focused...maybe that makes it more perfect... I dunno, I love it. I have a couple others like it but this is the best one for positioning. None of the others have the Turn so close and typical V bird look... Yeeeeah... So...birds! Come back for the Great Blue Heron.... I'll get it sometime. I just gotta have the fortune and honor of it's presence? Yeah. It doesn't come around too often. It's fun when it does though. =)
There are still many birds out there I haven't gotten a pic of so I'm sure there will be more pics soon. I just needed to get these out of the way. What shall I post next? I'm thinking Prometheus and the city.

"event","Originally known as the Siamese Fighting Fish. The most well-known and common member of the betta family group is the betta splendens. Other species of betta are harder to find and maintain than the common splendens.

Betta are an easily kept aquarium fish, and average at 2 and 1/2 to 3 inches in body length (tail fin length varies, with some specimens reaching 4 inches in total length). Males are the most common specimens found in pet stores, and are brightly colored with long fins. Females, once nearly impossible to find by non-breeders, have been trickling into pet stores for sale, though at first glance female bettas may be mistaken for a completely different species of fish. Females are the same size as male betta, often lack the same bright colors and never have the large amount of finnage that males have.

Bettas do not require airation in their tanks. The fish posses a ""labyrinth organ"" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice paddies and ditches. 

Bettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high protein diet in order to survive. Special betta food is needed for them to live, but to thrive they *need* to be fed on live foods, such as mosquito larvae, bloodworms, small fruit flies, and fruit fly maggots.

Males of this species are naturally competitive and agressive towards one another. The fish are often fought for money in Siam and Vietnam, in tents set up for the purposes, rather like aquatic cockfighting.

Betta have an average lifespan of 2 years (24 months). From hatching to death."

"event","7:11pm: Yeeha! My first entry. I remember my real first entry. It's full of ugly jealousy. Yay! So this is my art journal where I can feel free to post my art wether it be drawn or taken with my camera or whatever other crazy thing I might think of that's art like in the future. I also plan on rambling about my fish here. So far my only true friend is Skychan but I can see other friends stopping by and peeking in here once in a while so I really do have friends and don't care who adds this journal. It doesn't mean people wont see things. I really don't care anyway. Sky is just hardcore. Sky, you are hardcore...and apparently quite devoted to Onoeness. ^^ I love it.
Ok, pictures. I haven't actually uploaded any yet..or put them on my computer even so...it will be a while. No one reading this will feel the time like me though cause...they're reading, not making. Oh I ramble. That's what this journal is for though...I should add it to the interests. Ramble and babble. Fun.
I'm going away for a bit. I shall finish this with pictures and story later.

9:03pm: Oh dear...I hope photoshop can deal with all these pictures I'm opening so I can resize... There are lots. I feel I can post almost all the ones I take in here now cause it's what the journal is for and no one can get annoyed.
So yes, I've now put the pics on my computer and I'm trying to decide which ones I want to post. Trying not to post to many that are of the same thing..I take many picture of one thing often so I can choose the best pic after from it. Ah, digital cameras.
I think I shall start resizing and finish the selecting later so photoshop doesn't freeze and murder my computer...which could possibly murder me...but I've never had anything like that really happen...obviously...since I'm still here typing. I rule.
10:06pm: Ok, The first few ahem 20...have been uploaded.
These are from the walk I had the other day to Garbage Hill. Some are fuzzy or just might not look like anything but keep in mind that sometimes, though I didn't show any in my Onoe journal, I like things with art where you have to look beyond what you're actually looking at. Or something might be symbolic to me in an inside way...like inside joke inside way. A lot of the time it just has to do with colour and lights like most of the ones will be in this post. Also a lot are about contrast. I like contrasting things. Mmm..
The first few all look fairly the same but I was stalking someone and their dog who were on the hill..so I must show pictures of my stalking....because I'm a stalker.
Hmm...cuts? Yes, I shall still use cuts here.

This one is probably the most different of the ones that look the same. It has train tracks in them and a bit more slope on the hill and sun set light. You can see that by looking at the picture though. ^^;; I just feel like I should talk about it a bit. ^^
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6000587.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
You can see the shaded silhouette of the person in this one.. it's better in the one before actually. I think she was a lady but I couldn't make out from that far down and later I think she passed me when I was up on the hill but it might not have been here. She had a dog with her and it looked like the one I saw from below so... Meh, I dunno. I like the silhouette style whatever. I am so technical in my words.

And another. There are no power lines in this one but there is a star...which is really a planet but I'm unsure which one. I've been stalking it with my telescope on and off for the past few months...I've actually caught it too but it seems I don't know how to actually use the scope cause I can never make out anything more than a big white shiny thing with the insides of my telescopes tube in it... Yes.. Someday I'll figure it out.

Oh no! A train is coming! What am I to do? Ha ha! Onoe is a loooooser. There are often trains left sitting by the hill. Long ago when I was young and stupid I was told that inside a certain one a friend of mine, the one who was telling me, found a heck of a lot of cases of beer or something. I think they were trying to trick me into climbing up on top of the train and jumping down inside. I was tempted and I'm soooo glad I never did. He was an awful friend but I was young.

This one was taken on my way up the steepest side of the hill. Mmmm...contrastish. There's also a star but we get to see better pics of stars later.
Wow, I find I'm actually quite enjoying this. Showing pics and talking about them. It's like I'm going deeper into my life..or more so my interests. I could do that in Onoe I suppose but I always feel like..I dunno. People don't care or get annoyed. What would be the point of reading LJ posts then? If you're reading about someone's life you might as well read about their life..not just their day? Or emotions? I dunno...that's what I'm keeping Onoe for.
Ok, back to pics! the next ones are all about the city lights and sun set coloured sky.

Not much to say about this one. The sky is pretty and the lights bright. I like the darkness that is the hill. It evens out the crazy flow of colours and softens them.
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6000602.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Here is another much like the one above but it has more sharply buildings and slightly more lit sky.

I'm not sure what this is of but I think it might be of Rona...a store. It's not actually of the store...I don't go around taking pictures of stores...unless something about them catches my eye but that's the general direction...or building I use to identify my surroundings with. The picture itself is fun because the land below, the land that is not the hill, is light as if with fire from all the tiny lights on the city. I'm sure I have better pictures of this land of fire look but that's just what pops out at me while looking at this one.

These last two have been a bit blurry but in this one the ground is once again a field of fire and in the distance you can see the stadium. I must point it out because it's a major landmark for me.

Here's some fun with factory smoke that really isn't smoke but steam. There will be a lot more of that later...ok...more like two pictures or something.

Something about this one I really like.. The evenness of the colours I think. And the star watches over the city. If only I had held the camera a little more straight with the horizon. Oh well.
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6000611.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
This one is definitely looking towards Rona. The stadium is in the distance again. I actually took this picture because a plane was coming in to the airport at the moment. That's what that white spec of like in the middle of the picture in the sky is. It's kinda fun to watch them land sometimes. Anyway, more field of fire and the streets close up look golden. Our streets are paved with gold because this is really heaven. Ha. Yeah right.

These pictures aren't really overly good. They all appear to be of the same thing too. they'll get more interesting in other entries I promise. 
There's a plane in this one again I think.
Ah, here we go. This is the same picture but a little clearer.

This is slightly north of the last picture. I think I was focusing more on the building with all the lights shining through it's roof....the one in the middle of the whole picture; sky and ground. The next pic is a close up of it. The air port is a bit farther behind though. The air control tower is sticking up a bit.
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f303/OnoeHoshino/S6000642.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Here, the close up. The building I believe is actually Cost-co and the light shining through is made possible because they have fifty thousand skylights in their roof. It's an odd building but I noticed it that night and liked it so I took pictures of the building...or tried to but most of them turned out blurry. I like how the walls of the buildings around it light up with different colours because of the lights around them in both this picture and the one above.

More ""smoke"" fun. I love the colours and shapes. This is one of those pictures where the picture itself doesn't matter. You have to look beyond. It would look good if it had more detail and less blur, yes, I suppose but I kind of like the way it turned out. Its got its own art to it. It's pretty.

This is what happens when you use flash. It was a mistake picture I think. I turned the camera on and forgot to turn off the flash as I often do and it makes an interesting picture but things lose their...almost everything? I don't like flash much.

A sneak peek into the new Onoe look. I'm such a tease. It's me and it has blurless detail but you really can't see anything. Mwahaha! My bangs look really weird. Um...blame Matt for avoiding me! He's the reason I'm not posting pictures yet. Ha ha ha! Ok, he's not avoiding me I just haven't made many attempts at contacting/seeing him. As soon as he sees me there will be pictures. Anyone interested that is not him however could ask me for some. If you're special enough I'd give them to you...but you might have more fun in waiting. Oh the anticipation. Oh yes, I'm sure people are really anticipating pictures of me.. -_- I have painted quite the picture of hottness though..I hope I haven't done it so much that people are disappointed when they actually see it. Mwahaha! Oh, Onoe...you're so...attention seeking. Not really I just like obsessing.

I looooove the colours in this one and the tree finishes it all.
Oh, goodie. The sun has gone down now so we're getting into more interesting pictures. I love night pictures as opposed to sunset pictures.

My city, my love. I think this week I shall go downtown during the day and take pictures of some of the buildings down there. Some of the buildings there are so interesting they're often used in big movies. ""Shall we dance"" isn't a big one really but it's the only one I can think of off the top of my head. They remade a Chicago look for the movie with the buildings.

Hey look! It's the back half of Cliffton Community Center. I grew up there. Not really but in the winter we would go ice skating and I was often taken there as a kid to play on the play structure/swings.
I love how the street lights look puffy and glow in this picture. They're very cheerful and warm and big like. To the right of the center of the horizon you see three tall buildings standing side by side. On the other side of them is Osborne Village...or Osborne as I call it though that's really the name of the street which goes on for quite a ways beyond those buildings. The village is just behind those buildings though and that is where I got pierced today. See how far it is? It's not that far really but it would take more than an hour to walk there I think.. Probably.. Mmm...you are watching my life. That is so now the title of this entry.

Ah, light pollution. You are pretty yes but you make star gazing ever so hard. Up on the dark hill those lights dazzle your eyes.
In this pic you can really see the stadium. There is much detail. Look at those ugly, weird and scary beak like formations they use to seat people. I wonder if they'll really go through with this strange new stadium plan... It'll be interesting to take pictures of when it's all done. My childhood is being pulled down around me. The hill shall live forever. Until they bulldoze it to make room for some awful factory or parking lot or mall... Sigh..

This one's kinda nice. I like it. The gold from the city lights with the dark ground of the hill and the greenish black sky. The colours go well together and the shape of the tree and bush make it so.. I don't know but it wouldn't be quite so good if they weren't there. Or at least if the tree wasn't. They sort of frame it...or give it something solid to look at.. The lights are too scattered and disordered. It would be too much for the eye if the tree wasn't there. It sort of stabilizes the scene and adds contrast.
More light pollution and the UFOs are back. It's really just some sort of glare on the lens or something.
The more I look at this picture the more I love it. Hott like my hair. ^^;;

Even <I>more</I> ""smoke"" fun. Here you get to see where it's actually coming out of. I seem to like the tree silhouette. It's a contrast thing I think. It's darker than it's surroundings and everything behind it is so orderly with straight lines where as it's so...everywhere. Even the colours of the sky are straight. This is a really good picture too and Cost-co makes its appearance again. You can really see the sky lights in this picture. Mmm..pretty. I marvel at my own work. Oh, also the ""Smoke"" cloud is so soft that it also contrasts with the sharp spiky look of the tree. I love contrast, it is my boyfriend.

These next two are sort of the same as the one above. More ""smoke"". I like this one for the amount of sky that's been allowed in it. And, there's that star again. I like how the colour of the sky almost blends into the city lights.

Here it is again but with less sky and more ground. They're kinda blurry aren't they? >=P

What can I say about this one? I love the orderly disorder of the lights and their puffiness. I looked at this picture for a while earlier and thought about what that line is and then remembered. My night pictures are taken with or without flash. I don't like flash cause it distorts things. I think the pictures are more true when they don't have the artificial light helping them out so.. I take the flash off. Now, because there is no light to help it out the camera needs more time to take in the light that it can get from it's surroundings.. The shutter stays open for a loooong time. I can't hold the camera with night pictures. I have to set it down or things are blurry as hell because I'm not a steady rock. Anyway, the line in the picture is actually a plane coming in to land. Because the picture was taken over time, the light of the plane was taken in as it moved forward and created a line on the picture.. Does that make sense? It's the same as with old cameras. I don't remember what they're called but they take time to take pictures so you can stand in the picture for a few minutes and then step out of them and you'll be half there when the picture is done. You look like a ghost. It's interesting. I like photography.

I don't think I've ever posted a picture anywhere of northern night Winnipeg. This is north Winnipeg and the other side of the hill. I should go to that side sometime and take pictures there. I never do. I just stay to the ""extreme"" end and the ""circle"" which is in the middle and at the highest point of the hill.
So, northern Winnipeg. I like that red or pink or whatever coloured light. It's almost like the tree in other pictures. A focal point. Your eye is sort of drawn to it. You can't resist it, I know you can't. Stare into it's redish depths. Be hypnotized by it's circley goodness.

AAAAHHH! Ok...
Ha ha! This one's awesome. I want to use it as an icon or background or something. My mouth should have been open though. That would have been funny. Eat the city. You eat the things you love the most...like how Siobhan wanted to eat Prometheus last night. Funny.

This is possibly me most favorite picture. I lay in the grass to take it and I kept taking it until I got it perfect. City lights of brilliant lava lighting the sky. There's that tree again. I think it's become my signature. The star that you see is actually my favoritest star, Sirius. The brightest star in the night sky. Behind the tree is the constellation Orion. His belt is just above the top of the tree. Three stars sloping down towards Sirius. Up in the corner but still apart of Orion is the star Bellatrix. It's a great picture. I should name it Harry Potter. I think it deserves a better name than that though.
I love how the lights look like liquid.

This one I took for the shine on the tracks. Train tracks... railroad. Yes, I know words. I don't know why I'm posting it really. I do like the glow of those two lights in the center though. Look at how much space the light touches around it. Light is fun. Yup.

I love them trees. Come to me in the dark and I'll give you my camera, then try and take a picture of a tree. See if it turns out to be anything like my pictures. Oh yes, Onoe is the best.
Craphead is treesexual.

These last three have been on the way back down the hill. this one to me is sort of a painting... Look at the colours flowing together. Then there's that one small star again that sort of draws your attention despite the brightness of the street lights. Awesome.

This one's kinda fun. My camera is resting on the train track itself. I loooove the shinyness. I love anything shiny. It looks so smooth and carries your eye.

This one and the next one are the same but from different heights.

I was in love with this picture for a while too. I wonder if anyone can figure it out. My mom had a hard time.

Here's another version of it. It didn't work out the way I had seen it in my mind but...whatever.</lj-cut>
I can't wait till summer when I go to the lake. Now that I can take good night pics I'll be able to take all those pics I've wanted to take for a looong time. The moon rising, the milky way, different constellations and this image I see when I pass under trees that I can't explain. And when the northern lights come out...ooohhhh baby yeah! I've always wanted to catch some of them. Fun, fun, fun.
So there is my first crazy long art entry. I'm a bit tired so the ending has dragged on a bit I'm sure. Next I shall have pictures of last nights bonfire. There aren't as many but that's probably a good thing. Oh LJ, you love me.
I also need to play with the journal layout and get some icons and change the emoticons. I guess that fits in with layout... heh...
Until next time, keep fit and have fun."

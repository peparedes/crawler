I worked as an extra in a national commercial for ""Toro"" dinner sauces and gravies. So in two to three weeks, you might recognize me as ""the guy pretending to be eating in the background of that gravy commercial"". It earned me 1000 grunker* as well. Sweet!

<B>Lingowise:</B>
I finally took my latest exam in Latin, and I'm currently trying to learn Japanese. Nihongo-o yomimasu. Hai.

<B>Dreamwise:</B>
Last night I dreamt that I jumped ontop of a bridge while holding a towel, and suddenly the wind caught me and I was flying about 1000 m high up in the sky. It was an amazing feeling. Then I realized that I was going to die once I hit ground again. That too was an amazing feeling, accepting that death was coming. Of course, it <B>was</B> a dream, so naturally I made it safely back down. But still... uh... oh well.

Miscalculation: There'll be no hospitalization. Not yet, anyway. I don't know what happened. Them psychophants had me phooled. Shitfags. Ergo, alas, I'm still left over to my overmedicated, whining self, licking my wounds with a poisonous toungue. Keep thinking that the key to salvation is spartan lifestyle combined with childish play. Yarr. Will have to clear out my room and flush away my little satanic henchman, or computer, as some call it. I have too many ""things"". I want to make tings, like cartoons or comics, but I keep failing, and fall into dark mindscapes. My bastard mentors inside me keep carving me up, and shove me into little pink sausages and feed me to horny german leatherclad demons. I gasp and cry out my need for primordial barbarism; I want to run naked and roaring into a forest of grime and explode in a fountain of blood and screams and excrement. Delivery from my cowardice. I have to scratch and tear, gore my filthy sinner-hands into my stomach, through flesh and sinew and feces and rip out my innards and cut them into little pieces of dogfood. Grab my heart and soul, and gorge on all my fears, just lay bare all the sins and filth of my life and my past. Eat it all up and laugh manically while I gargle my spleen and masturbate onto my freshly cut out anus. And at the top of my feast of metaphorical body gook (of course it's all <I>metaphorical</I>; what, you think I'm some kind of sicko?), then I forgive myself. Just tell my constant nerves to go buttrape themselves with at rusty razor. Only then will I have peace...

Anyway, all this scatporn cleared out, however, my life still has no filling. I'm as empty a personality as they come. One idea for provisional means to satisfy this need for ""purpose"", is <B>reading</B>, under the alibi of becoming wiser. Let it be known at this point that I've read very few books; I read very slowly. Nevertheless, I just finished reading ""Good Omens"" by Gaiman and Pratchett. Damn fine reading, but I felt the ending left something to be desired. A few too easy solutions in the hazy roundup. But then again, it's hard to make a perfect apocalypse, and they almost did. Now I'm trying once more for ""Steppenwulf"" by Hesse, seeing as I only managed to get halfways through before the library wanted it back. So, I guess for the record, my ""meaning of life"" is reading. Hm. Deep.

You know... I really wanted to write something <B>nice</B> today."

Not that I update particularly often lately; but then again, if you knew how much annoyingly lardy, whiny bitching I spare you each day by <B>not</B> posting, you'd probably all hug me and give me lots of dollars. Anyway, it is my firm belief that my computer is if not Satan himself, then at least one of his favourite henchmen. And I am his ever obedient slave, as he ejaculates his DOOM all over my wrinkly ass. So, in other words, I need a little time off; a little rebellion, if you like. That, and I'm being shipped off to some asylum in a few weeks or so. Medicine's not working."

My bedroom is full of medicine. Yet still, I'm not better. Psychosis, psychosomatic aggravation, anxiety. Derangements within derangements. I don't know where to look or turn. There's no relief. How I yearn for rest.

I try to sleep, but then come the nightmares. Much too real nightmares. Every night. And thanks to narcolepsy, I never wake up. I'm locked inside my own body, running for my life. Dreads. Horrors. Blunders, even.

And worst of all, I fear, is that <b>this is life</b>. This is as good as it gets.

"event","My body's rebelling lately. I'm freezing and shaking and sweating cold, yet I'm not ""ill"". I can't relax and constantly feel like blacking out and exploding into a pool of salty tears. It may well be my new medicine. It's a heavy anti-psychotic drug. I just finished with my amphetamine-like drug (ritalin) because, well, guess what; it made me sleepy. How can that be? Stupid medicine. Well, fuck me for bitching about my medicine.

I dreamt that I was my own father last night. There were some massive conspirations about, entailing, amongst others, a band of arab nomads who pretended to kill me and my son (me) on camera, in order to save us from the mother. She'd called my son ""Monrose"", something that made me very annoyed. I've slept a lot lately. Of the last 36 hours, somewhere close to 30 of them have been spent in Noddyland. Still, I'm as sleepy now as I was before. It's very hard for me to stay awake on a regular basis, but now I have no control anymore. Fell asleep during class, at my friends place, at dinnertable, at kendo and almost even while driving my motorbike. This is <B>not</B> very good.

Argh, by body's fucking me up again. Have to sleep.

"event","So... Kendo grading in less than a week. I've never been to a martial arts grading before. I only have experience from boxing, where there's no such thing as grading involved. It's all about bag-punching, face-bashing and rope-skipping all from the start. Haven't done that in aeons though. Hm. I kinda miss it.

I always juggle zillions of projects, but I rarely complete any of them. I've therefore agreed with myself to prioritize getting my server and webpages up and running, in order to use them as a base for future experiments. I also promised to host some of <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/fugged/"" target=""_blank"">Maria</A>'s photos and movie projects, so I cant postpone it any longer. I've got the domain and the server, and thanks to the good help of my room-mate Tore, I also got a nameserver. But there's still a bit of work to do in getting the servers online. And the fact that I have no clue whatsoever on how to do that, well, it doesn't actually help. I don't want to exploit poor Tore either. He's working very hard and he just had a bad run-in with the womankind. He looks burnt-out, and that worries me enough already. So if anyone's got a copy of ""the rookies comprehensive guide to apache http server mastery"", I'd be you slave for a week if I could borrow it.

<center><div STYLE=""width: 80%; text-align: left;""> Just for a sense of abundance, here is a short list of other projects:

<B>* Arranged, obscene footage/documentary of myself; ""the naked truth about ole""(?)
* AMV-work for Matt at Slacker Studios; currently working on Noir (anime) to music by Shellyz Raven
* Comic book in latin
* Various ""art"" collections/themes
* Swordsmanship; ""theory, practice and etiquette for the modern swordmaster"" (Hahaha, yes, corny, I know)
* Short stories
* Plastaline film
* Animation; both by hand and in Flash.
* Fight evil, then bring DOOM</B></div></center>

There's plenty more, but who cares? Anyway, if anyone has ideas or suggesteions, please don't hesitate to unravel."

The dizzyness prevails. I faint and wobble about all day. But it has merrits. I don't analyze, because that makes me nauseous. One would think that's a bad thing, but it's not: it makes me spontaneous as hell, and I'm incapable of worrying. It's a new sensation, I think, and even though I'm good for nothing, at least I do new things and have a laugh about it.

Due to this new batch of impulsiveness, I've been to a lot of auditions lately. One for interpretive dance and two for acting. I got a part in a movie. Just a tiny role; three lines and a bit of acting. But I might get some bigger parts if I do well. Filming starts in two hours. Wish me luck!"

<B>Health:</B> First week of constant canabis-like dizzyness was fun, but it's been a few weeks now, and quite frankly, it's beginning to tear on me. Got two more doctors, so now I litterally work with a team of doctors/experts to find the soulutions to certain problems.

<B>Healthy leisure:</B> I adore cartoonist David Firth. He is an unsettling genious of vast proportions. He's the creator of the legendary ""Salad Fingers"" series, but he's made a lot more. In the spirit of laughter and sharing, I showed some friends one of his masterpieces, <A href=""http://www.fat-pie.com/milkman.htm"">Milkman</A>, in hope of making their day a brighter one. Now, I'll admit that the film is a tad morbid, but what shocked me was the surprise of them all yelling at me, saying that ""it wasn't funny at all, you pervert, it was just sick sick sick, just like ole, who just stood there laughing!"" Now they look at me in a funny way. That really put me out. I honestly do not consider this piece bad at all. Just very surprising and god damn funny."

"event","This wednesday I was a father-to-be for a day. It was great, and Ole was smiling like a hysterical maniac. Hanna's pregnant (as far as I'm concerned, I'm not to blame). We were cute, holding hands and hugging and such. In the evening I followed her home and kissed her goodnight. Afterwards I went home and made some more disgustingly obscene filming of a nude Ole. I think maybe I'm, subconsciously, making a concept out of it. Something that might end up as a movie or documentary about myself. All in the nude and perversely ""honest"". But I like it.

Went through more tests. Cerebral scan this time. More blood samples are to be taken tomorrow. Apparently, doc's not sure if I'm a narcoleptic after all, since my medicine didn't work. They're currently checking for multiple sclerosis (MS) - yay for me, I get a rapid lapse of the central nervous system, ultimately winding up in a painful death. Suddenly, incurable narcolepsia doesn't sound like such a bad deal after all. In the end though, a ""lethal"" illness would make all the pieces fit I guess.

So, with the possibly impending doom of mr Ole, I went on a shopping spree that left me 4000 grunker (approx US$ 650) poorer. Bought some movies (<I>Riget I & II</I>, <I>Tokyo Godfathers</I> and <I>Kagemusha - the shadow warrior</I>), loads of candy and a two bags full of painting equipment. Hell, I've better be dying now!

Anyway, I know I'm exaggerating this whole shitty infirmity business, and quite frankly I don't really care. I probably caused this myself, through my lack of caution. I just like to whine."

"event","I am falling drastically apart and am therefore not going to write about me. Well, apart from that I just filmed myself in the nood. That was nice.

In an attempt to get ""Finding Neverland"", a movie with Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, my roommate accidently ended up downloading an obscure underground film called simply ""Neverland"". We, being me, my roommate and his girlfriend, did however not know of this mixup before the whole film was over, and were all quite baffled as the bizarely modified plot of good old ""Peter Pan"" made it's freakish stroll across the screen. Wendy, Michael and John, the ""children"" were all twisted adopted ethnic children. Tink, the fairy, was a burn-out raver girl, giving out her small plastic bags of ""fairy dust"" to make the children ""fly"". Peter Pan himself was a charming but psychotic boy, so locked up in his own delirious dreamworld that he thought he'd never grow old. The most beautifully portrayed character was still ""Captain Hook"", the perversely homoerotic head of maintainance of the ""Neverland"" theme park, obsessed with capturing the squatting ""lost boys"" and hang the by ""the hook"" in his kinky underground dungeon...

... in which we find this lovely excerpted bit of dialogue:

Wendy: Are we to die?
Hook: ... from PLEASURE!

"event","Just made a new friend. Gordon Finck. I made him out of modelling clay. I think he's danish. A manipulative old dickhead, but I like him. Doesn't talk much, and when he does it's usually questions about my childhood. He claims that we're related, but I doubt so. Still, I just call him uncle Gordon, however kinky it sounds. It happens that he tells me stories, wondrous adventures, of fantastic creatures, unearthly landscapes and vibrant characters. They are neat, modest stories, but always have brilliant sarcasm and irony about them. I really enjoy his stories.

Still full of bad bacteriae. Dizzzzy and coughing. Psychotic as hell, thinking my smart hat will save me from the strange powers of... um... I don't know what. My room is full of personalities, and they all want to be present at the same time. They're all talking over eachother. I get headaches and have to sleep in the livingroom. Hanna came to see me last friday. She gave me some ""pills for nothing"" (fun candy) and some late-seventies WWII comic books. She's good (and pregnant too, which is weird). We sat down and just... talked. It was nice. She claims I've gotten much worse since last time she saw me. She had a theory that the bedroom personalities have once manifested out of my cardinal moods, then evolved and thus eventually consumed all my moodstuffs. That might also, she said, explain why I have trouble expressing my mood, since my moods are but gloomy knolls. Anyway, psychosis is not at all a bad thing. Afterall, nobody views the world in the same way. Right? Um... what comes next? Why... honestly, why do I post here? I hardly know where I am. I don't understand. Is this new? Do I do this often or Shit whats going on? Where's everybody? oh god. I have to stop writing. God damn it, my bedroom is flashing in and out of the thing ahm... i feel alone... will I be better? Stop writing! This is probably awful. Don't dare to look. Just end it, ole, nice and easy. mmmm..."

"event","About a week ago, I wrote down three things I like about myself, of which one was ""my kickass immunity to illness"". Naturally, two days later I fell victim to a cold from Hell, one that still shakes me by the gonads like a mix-master on crystal meth. That leaves me with the following two things that I like about Ole:
""that I never seem to have trouble with my economy"", and
""the others""
I do however not have the faintest idea what ""the others"" were supposed to mean, so in effect I'm down to the one about me being rich-ish. Oh well, at least is makes my life a lot simpler.

For some silly reason, we people tend to believe that our lives start from a blank each year. Whatever shitty, self sentered mood we were in on the 31st of december, we always think we'll be clean and fresh as an albino virgin's tit from the second the ""new year"" begins. This is due to our blind idolization of old systems of order, which is also the reason why we think it's of outmost importance to celebrate everything that's divisible by 10 or 5. In sad recognition of being a prime example of these naive superstitions, I present my list of new years resolutions:

* get a job (one that pays in actual currency this time)
* carry out at least two ""creative"" actions each day
* learn seven classical pieces on piano/organ by heart
* get certificate for driving big, wheely things, like lorries
* read more
* be decisive

...and here follows a list of items which, for one reason or another, was removed from my list, or was too hopeless to make it onto the list in the first place:

* get a girlfriend
* stop whining
* dedicate my life to helping others
* travel abroad
* do acid
* kill God
* write a novel

"event","I just wached ""Animal Farm"" on TV, a screen version of George Orwell's classic by the same name. ""A pleasant change form all the sickeningly stupid christmas movies that ravage every TV channel this time of year"", I thought, and let my entire mood rely on this photoplay of one of my favourite books. Had to be good, didn't it? And it was a cute movie. Talking animals, charming british acting and a typical rural setting. I was a smiling happy Ole, as the story allowed me to dwell in old and tattered memories; Old Major and the animalist revolution, development of the farm, the unjust eviction of Snowball, the rise of Napoleon, the building of the mill... I was quite pleased to watch it, and was taken by the broken hopes, the frustrations and the despair. Then suddenly, as the story was entering it's final conclusion, the main point of the whole tale - that no matter the ideal, there will always be powerhungry people exploiting it - they had <B>CHANGED THE FUCKING ENDING!!!!</B> They made a happy ending! I was violently torn apart, all my innards wasted onto the wall. How can they do that?! They let Orwell's masterpiece fall victim to the very thing he was trying to warn us about. Darn it, I give up. As of now, I'm pro Bush and whatever else that can help me rid the universe of moronic humanoids. Fuck you!"

"event","I am the <B>STORK</B>! I work at a hospital. I delivered a baby today, quite literally. Yay! The mother was delighted. Personally, I find babies scary beyond reason, yet strangely fascinating. They look like large, mutated rats. And they keep staring at me with a kind of questioning expression, just as if they can see right through me; they know how hollow and inconsequential I am and they laugh at me.

I can just barely stand babies, because they don't speak. Other than that, I loathe children. They make me nervous. Children are mean, and not cute at all. On top of that, if I against all rationality should have one of my own, I'd have the conscience issue as well. I mean, who in their right set of mind wants to force another poor fuckup to go through ""life"", this drab and wretched waste of time? It's cruel and selfish. 

I truely hate the concept of parents and parenthood. In their defence thay say things like ""Children are the future"". What ignorant fucking lies! Children are only humans, just like you, and you're quite the ""future"", aren't you? ""But it will be a good child! We'll teach her all we know! He will contribute to world peace!"" they might say. Well, so said <B>your</B> parents, and look at you now. Look at the pointless, sinfull lives you're living. Look at your past and bathe in your pains beyond numbers. And while you're looking, look at your surroundings, at all the sick, sick people, at all the pain, poverty and cruelty in our beloved world. Is this what you offer your child, you twisted perverts? If you really want to help the world, then do your part in destroying all traces of humanity. Only then will there be peace etc. Of course, they'll continue: 
""It's our human <I>instinct</I> to have children"". Yes, but so is killing, ravaging, lying, etc. The primitive human kills, rapes, lies and steals, and then fucks like wild fire to keep this wheel of life spinning. Whatever we consider good are all things we have to restrain ourselves to achieve. I for one want to facefuck parents with sticks of lit dynamite. I want to carefully peel them with a dull wooden spoon while they read aloud the compared statistics of good versus bad. I want to buttrape them with spiky iron poles and dance in their intestines. Call it my instinct; if they're allowed to follow theirs, then I should be allowed to follow mine."

My world got a whole lot darker. I do not know why. I dear not guess. Sleeping and wanting to sleep is all I've been good for. Times have been bad before, probably a lot worse, but I can't say I recognize this darkness. A girlfriend said I'm a blind man. Very fitting. I am a blind man.

I kissed a lot of people this week. Or was it last week? 5 girls and 1 boy, at least. Have to admit that the boy kissed best. I regret to not have any feelings for these people. No strong feelings, anyway. I should have a bad conscience as well, as some of these people have true feelings, and others are even pregnant. Ethics have just gone and left me. Next week I'll kiss another handful of people, not really caring for the kissing nor the people. I'm a blind man, through and through.

I've been increasing my standing within the booking organization where i work, through my brilliant secretary-skills and fair affinity for system and bureaucracy. But last thursday was very special for me, work-wise, as I made my debut as ""chief of the main event"". This is normally something left for the older members of the organisation, since the likes of me (rookies) are lacking in both experience and ability. But this particular thursday our event was something called ""Bierstube"", which is basically a head-over-heels beer-orgie, or in other words: Hellnight for whomever carrying a position with any kind of responsibility is concerned. However, I, in my literal twitching for an opportunity to get a hold of some ass-whipping POWER, uregently advertised my interest and without any hesitation from the board, I was given my much desired stature of DOOM. Muhahaha! With a little less than a week of preparations, I spent my time scheming various plans and experiments and praparing for the worst, yet with a relieving contentment. When the day finally came, I was luckily able to manage my stress in a controlled manner, keeping my cool while still getting gallons of blood to my head, despite all the people literally swiming on the floors and dancing on the tables and tossing beer at eachother in between. I eventually ended up handling the arrangement better than anyone other could have, and they all adored me. Adored me, and feared me, as the harsh-but-brilliant ruler that I am. I tell you, this organisation is already well within my grasp! Waaaahahahahaha!

Come to think of it, it may well have been a dream. I can't really remember the specifics, 'cause I've been having a seriously bananas rhythm of sleepong and day and night and it's all been one large 72-hour day, one with great events that may well never have happened... I'm going insane, but at least I'm social... or am I? I got some pot for free that doesn't really smell at all like pot, which probably explains why I got it for free. Or maybe it was I who took some dried leaves from a plant in the livingroom and fabricated the whole charade about the pot. I don't really want to smoke it, but maybe I could put it into a stew. Maybe it's just oregano. Arrgh, these posts all turn out the same. Chaos. I seem to desire both order and chaos at once, though not as order in chaos or chaos in order. I may not be the same person. Chaos. Sudden changes. Yet I put my thoughts of chaos into a system. Order. Peace and quiet. And the unavoidable center of the vortex, my most revered desire, between chaos and order: silence!






I'm... confused... no, I did not smoke the... um... oregano.

Anyway, you're all delicious people. You know I mean you, 'cause nobody else reads this LJ. But you truly are; I dig you all!"

"event","My lungs just exploded or something. All of a sudden, I experience pain when I inhale and a distant taste of blood when I exhale. A bit scary. Apart from that, and my sleeping issues, I'm good as a mountain goat. So I'm not ill, just in pain. But I think I had it coming - I'm an asshole.

When it comes to emotions, I'm quite blunt. I find it very hard to care about people, and have to work like a horse to fool myself and others into thinking I do. There used to be one person I really cared about, and that's my little sister. However, a few weeks ago she was visiting me, and things got rather ugly. She's psychotic and accused me of... various nasty stuffs... which she didn't really mean, but it hurt me real bad anyway, and I basicly told her to go fuck herself. And now I can't stand her. She used to be my only reason to keep any connections with my family. So fuck them all! Not that they're bad people in any way; it's just that I don't care. A sad tale indeed, yet I can't bring myself to feel for them. As mentioned, I'm a coldhearted asshole...

Feelings let aside, I just spoke with my sleeping-advisor-doctor-thingie, and he said that I most likely suffer from narcolepsia (like that guy in Moulin Rouge). I used to laugh like crazy of people and animals with narcolepsia, not knowing all this time I've been a narcoleptic myself. That's life's irony for ya!

Nothing much good has happened in my life lately, but if it's true that good things come to the one who looks for it, then it pretty much figures."

I just got back from work. It's 07.00 am. I've been an active worker, despite the fact that the job is of voluntary nature (i.e. the pub I may have mentioned earlier. Yes). And in less that two hours I have to drive my beloved speed-miracle about 100 kilometres to celebrate my old grandmother's birthday. She's ninety today! Huzzah!
Quite impressive, really.

I'm tired as a donkey's ass, but I can't sleep. Quite tearing. See, in my last post, which was about ten days ago, I mentioned sleep research. It went well. I recieved the raw results of the tests two days ago, but in order to get a diagnosis of any kind, I need to take some more tests tomorrow. Exciting!

"event","I had a twisted dream last night. I dreamt I had a kitten. A gray little kitten. A mean and evil little devil kitten. Whenever I tried to do something nice, this furry satan came to scratch me bloody. He always had to be better off than me: if I was eating, he wanted my food. If I was relaxing in bed, he'd appear in front of me with his shiny, sharp claws, ready to take my bed for himself. If was playing with my friends, he'd manipulate them against me. And he always scratched me, even if I gave him what he wanted.

Then, at one occation, I was going to the toilet. But just before I was able to shut the bathroom door, our ""friend"", the feline demon, slipped through and scratched me, because, naturally, he had to go before me. In an act of frustration and boost of courage, I seek my revenge; while he is peeing, i push the cat equivalent of emperor Nero into his own pool of urine. Laughing an evil laugh, I then urinate on top of him. He's cursing like never before, and like only a kitten form hell can curse. I smile at him, wave goodbye and flush. I hear a dwindling ""NOOOOOoooooo...."", as the cause for my demise disappears down the drain...

I wake up with a smile..."

"event","This thursday I started working at a pub; ""Kvarteret"" in Bergen. It was great! A mix between selling beer and booking bands and stuff. It's voluntary work, so instead of recieving money, I get lots of free concerts and inexpensive beer. And I work less than one day a week. Good enough for me. Yeehaw!

Friday was party night. A get-to-know party for my new job. True to personal history and tradition, I got wasted way beyond reason. Danced a lot. A friend of mine, Aasmund, was trying to hit on a beautiful girl, Sarah. Aasmund has a history of liking girls who fall for one of his friends. Poor bastard. And so, of course, she picks me up and I accidentally end up kissing this quite so beatuiful girl. I honestly didn't really fancy her, but I was too drunk to care. But I apparently don't like kissing; I was bored (And I don't like sex either. Me be eunuch? I tell you, I'm falling. Hard). So, I tell her something lame, like ""I'm bad boyfriend material"", go out, drink some more, dance some more. I space out, and decide it's time to leave. On my way home, I actually walk on a fence and injure my knee. How fucking rediculous is that?! I almost wish I had a video camera myself. Now I've been hobbling around like some gestapo weirdo all day.

So yes, I'm lonely, but this is what I've chosen. I guess I like better being lonely than having to deal with people on a close and personal level. Then again, they're both just different kinds of hell. I can merely choose the general path of my own inevitable doom (why, aren't we in a jolly mood today?). I crank me up..."

"event","Well, what can I say? My motorbike is still at the workshop. Looking back at my journal, I see it's now entering it's 8th week in ""constant repair""... my ass. Darn lazy mechanics! The summer's over now, you screwing monkeys! See, in the bastard lands of Scandinavia (where I live, in my little, but cosy cave), summer is the only season in which we're not freezing our gonads off, and as such, the only time of the year it's at all possible to use any kind of two-wheeler. So, despite all the mosquitos, heat and sweat, we tend to like summers up here. And a fine summer it was too. Oh, how I longed to ride like the biker-ruffian that I am in the warn summer breeze. Hm... I suddenly realized that I haven't named her. The motorbike, that is. Then again, I believe that is a good thing. Myep.

Been to my first more or less proper theatre audition. Dracula. I was one of about twelve boys competing for seven parts. Compaired to the girls, being close to fifty fighting over two parts, I had fairly good chance of getting one (60% vs 4% chance). Of course, I obviosly sucked big time, and have to settle with seeing the whole shebang as a spectator. Or maybe I just might not? Ah, well.

So, university life is back. Linguistics and history. Plus religion and norse literary study. Seems I'm up for a stiff four months. Moany-woany. They're all interresting subjects, but I haven't been tending class. Or lessons. Or whatever. Maybe I should get a job instead? Or do... something? I'm a lazy Ole, yet I don't even bother to sleep. See, the main reason I don't go to bed is not that I'm not tired. It's neither because of the nightmares, nor is it due to the fear of the hideously painful thoughts and feelings that tend to pop up at sleepless nighttimes. It's more so the horror of waking up, of being ripped out of a dream (even the nightmares are pleasant in a way) and once again confronted with this drab, wretched life. Again and again. I'm not saying I have a bad life. No, as far as lives and opportunities go, I'm rather well off. But that's exactly my point. This is, in all it's glory, as good as it gets. Of course, I could always have a more optimistic disposition to it all, but that would only be foolishly naive, right?

Darn. I try to make these entries short, but I fail. Pathetic, boring AND long. Yet still not so long as to be considered an achievement... Sheesh!

I'm lazy. Despite that, I made seven or eight sketches for Trollmannen. It tokk me a while, but I got there eventually. However, I had a bad fit of bottomless despair, and ended up burning all the sketches. Oh, well, just have to make us some new ones. Damn dirty apes!"

I have this tradition of going to the <A href=""http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/index.php?code=1"">Roskilde festival</A> each summer. I've enjoyed the last four festivals and was looking forward to my fifth year as a festivist. Besides, one of the foremost centers of my attention, the all-beautiful Lillian, is also attending this grand party this year, so it would have to be good. Boss-of-Porters has however prevented me from participating this year, as I have to take part in the abovementioned activities this weekend. Breaks my heart and spirit. But then, I don't really believe in broken hearts, and spirits are just plain stupid, so as far as I'm concerned, I'm as fine as a wet piece of baloney.

Lillian and <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/zrb/"">Mentos</A> was there. I was there... I shouldn't have; broke down and started sobbing in the bathroom. I left as soon as the band had finished playing. I got to the car, drove far away and succumbed to self-pity. God, I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be crazy. I want to enjoy life. There is a perfetly fine world right in front of me - I'm just to blind and stoopid to see it. I desperately need changes.

When it comes to women, I'm quite so inept. I say all but the right things and humiliate them when I intend to flatter them. Even in those of my dreams that are supposed to be ""wet dreams"", I'm so tactless and clumsy that I never get to the <I>wet</I> part and have to settle for yet another embarrasing ordeal. It's probably because I'm not fit to be a boyfriend. I'm bad (and not so in the charming, rebellious handsome-boy manner). Too dumb, selfish and bitter. I've had one proper girlfriend, and I expect her to be my last. Even though I too am scarred by the mutually subversive experience, I was so very, very mean to her. Christ, I'm such a thoughtless asshole. We didn't last more than four or five months, but that was more than enough to serve plenty of grief. I treat the good and beautiful girls like the shit I am. And all I do about it is feeling sorry for my self. Jesus, what a wanker.

"event","Muh, this is just insane; Trollmannen (""the Wizard""), a good friend of mine, is a musician. He plays the drums and does so good, and he's got several quite so nice bands. But he's also vocalist in a drunken side-project called <A href=""http://www.trollfest.tk"">Trollfest</A>, which means roughly ""troll party"". Please, check it out and tell me what you think, then show all your friends. The music has roots in norwegian black metal (sorta hardcore) but more lively, and sarcastic to boot. The lyrics are in ""trollish"", a language almost comprehensible if you know some german and norwegian (but that doesn't matter, as they're sung in grim vocal and nobody understands it anyway). Anyhow, Trollfest just got a contract with a german record company, which is pretty a far-fetched idea due to the nature of the band. The age of wonders is obviously still not over. However, I've been asked to do the artwork for their first album; a real assignment! Ooooh! So I'm happy. Wheeeeeeeeeeeee! So, as soon as I've failed my exam on tuesday, I've got some serious arting to do..."

Oh, restrooms. Where the action happens.
What I like best about onesixone's female rooms is the round, comfy seat. Some clever person has recognized the potential of the bathroom to be more than just a urination outlet. Girls like to toilet in groups. And girls like to gossip. And lots of gossip goes on here. Dancing makes some girl's feet sore. Sometime's we're dragged to the bathroom unwillingly by some annoying friend who decided to break the seal early. There are so many reasons why any kind of seat is so appreciated.

At onesixone you're not going to find any graffiti. Maybe it's because people respect the design, but probably it's because the walls are tiled, and brown tiled walls don't scream out ""WRITE ON ME!"". You can try, but it just looks crap. I do admire the lightboxes though in each cubicle. I'm not quite sure I understand them, but they're preferable to use as a rest for one's bag when the floor is covered in bile and who-knows-what-omg filth. (Which did appear to be regularly cleaned I might add. And the staff were prompt in refilling the toilet paper when I committed my karma act for the day by telling them it had run out.)

Although this bathroom isn't unisex, some people like to treat it as if it is. At the end of one night I was trying to recover from my drunkenness and overheard a couple fumbling in the next cubicle. She was telling him to pull up his pants. He was asking for her name.
Earlier on the same night, two of my friends ventured in to find a boy stranger waiting for them. Somehow some kind of orgy ensued... I'm not quite sure of the details. But I'm not sure I really want to be.

Broken glass, spilt champagne, bandaids and vomit, and a small aquarium to oversee the night's activities. The funness outweighs the grottiness, donc c'est pas mal du tout."

I came from living in a larger house with more people where I had a bathroom practically to myself, except when visitors came (cousins at Christmas = 8 people to one shower = not very cool). Now I live in an apartment just bigger than a shoebox, where I am awoken in the mornings to the sound of the shower running. I don't know if it works the same for everyone else, but when I wake up I really need to pee. Hence I try to resist sleeping in the car on long trips (it never works though, damnit). The biggest downside of this bathroom, whilst it looks nice and is pretty with its string of blue tiling, is that it is a combined toilet, bath, shower and laundry. I could handle sharing a bathroom with 8 people that summer, because the toilet was separate. There's nothing worse than really needing to pee, not having access to the bathroom as someone has just begun showering, and that sound of running water driving me crazy as my bladder almost reaches bursting point.

Yes I am lucky that my housemate's parents are loaded and kind enough to have donated a brand new washer and dryer. I cannot complain about that. But our pretty bathroom has had it's share of dramas.

The light-globe died. And it was covered with some crazy cover that we couldn't remove, so we brought in a floor lamp from my bedroom to replace it. This meant I didn't have a lamp in my room, which upset me, and it also freaked out my friends when they had no idea how to turn the light on in the bathroom. And as there is only one powerpoint, one must choose between washing machine, dryer, or some light to pee by.

I flooded the bathroom once, accidentally left the tap on for about 5 minutes. This was when we realised we had plumbing issues, as water overflowed from the basin and covered the whole floor. Apparently in Britain they have little holes in the basin to stop that from happenning. Why aren't we so clever?

Also, you probably can't tell from the photo, but there is a little scrap of loo paper floating in the toilet. It refuses to fully flush! Such insolence! And these days the pipe in the sink clogs up really easily, so we have to spit out our toothpaste into the bath, otherwise the sink becomes full of dirty water and you know that ain't cool.

There's no fan in this bathroom. I don't understand why people do that, some bathroom designers need to be shot. The window doesn't really open, it's one of those wind-out ones, so after a shower the whole room steams up and is probably implanting millions of seeds of mildew, because I'm sure that's how that works.

Lastly, our shower has a only a few temperatures. It goes straight from cold, to luke warm, to fucking hot, to really fucking hot!!! Generously leaving out the bracket I prefer; quite warm to nicely hot and definitely not scalding.

I think my view on this bathroom should be quite clear. It's not great. The pretty tiles aren't even really <i>that</i> pretty, they don't compensate for anything. But at least I've learnt one thing. I can handle living in a shitty bathroom. I was going to say that my criteria when choosing a house with a bathroom has reached higher standards, but really it's not that bad. I'm a survivor. And if I smell and appear grossly unhygienic, no one has ever mentioned it to me, so I'll go along living in blissfully ignorant filth."

This is one of my favourite bathrooms. Simple, decrepit, and old. It's found in the Frank Tate building, a windy and mysterious art deco establishment where music can be heard from behind closed doors, and five dollar salsa classes can be attended.

This is the kind of bathroom where I'm sure one of those legendary college killings was held. I can imagine the half-naked girls in the adjoining changing room letting out terrified shrieks as some crazed salsa student mows everyone down. Disturbing, yes. But cool. History is cool. Just ask my year 7 History teacher Mrs. Miller. She taught us about archaeology using Mars bars.

So, this bathroom is falling apart. It's generally empty. I've only ever come across one person in the building and she assumed I was lost. I pointed out that I wasn't, but she just cackled and muttered incomprehensible things to herself and shuffled off, never to be seen again! Although I must admit, it was only this afternoon. Still, my conclusion - ghost. And my verdict - a ghost is a fucking cool thing for a bathroom to have. Think Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter. Sigh, that's one bathroom I would do anything to visit. 

Frank Tate gets A++ for eeriness and possible inter-realm breakdown."

"event","Loo Review is a very important website indeed. One of the most often committed and important functions of daily human life that goes without thought or mention, is the act of going to the toilet! This is an act that can be found to be either pleasurable, trivial, or uncomfortable, yet each time it is NECESSARY. My goal is to provide a database for the most pleasurable, ambient and fun toilet spots I can find. The toilet has become more than just a hole in which to leave your bodily fluids. Toilets and bathrooms have become message boards, cubicles of solace & gossip, and even convenient rooms to have a good quick fuck.

Here is where I will showcase them."

"event","oh, iron and wine, you make me smile. 

run like a race for family
when you hear like you're alone
the rusty gears of morning
and faceless, busy phones
we gladly run in circles
but the shape we meant to make is gone

and love is a tired symphony
you hum when you're awake
and love is a crying baby
mama warned you not to shake
and love's the best sensation
hiding in the lion's mane

so i'll clear the road, the gravel
and the thornbush in your path
that burns a scented oil
that i'll drip into your bath
the water's there to warm you
and the earth is warmer when you laugh

and love is the scene i render
when you catch me wide awake
and love is the dream you enter
though i shake and shake and shake you
and love's the best endeavor
<b>waiting in the lion's mane<b>

remind you of anyone? *insert hand gesture here*"

"event","It occurs to me how much I have to do this fall...what with trying to get into college and all. I feel moderately accomplished after turning in my paper and getting props on it from my teacher (even though it was a week late). I pulled an all-nighter last night, mainly to see if I still had it in me. I do. Now I'm sitting around trying to organize my life and tackle the five chapters of late calculus work I've been ignoring. I'm in a good mood though- drinking coffee and listening to good music while I pack to go to Boston on Sunday. I should have nothing but delight for about the next week and a half: Boston is one of my favorite places because I get to go to Cambridge (the coolest nerdy city)and to Walden Pond. And then, when I get home, KAYLEIGH AND SUSAN (and Matt???) ARE COMING!!!! I can barely sleep at night with excitement. Oh wait, I don't sleep at night anymore anyway.

I still have this weird and deep longing to be at GSP. I am praying that I'll hold on to all the coolness and confidence I picked up there...I was changed so much by my incredible friends and allll of my experiences so I just don't want to lose any of that. I'm going to be such a pain in the ass back at school because I know all of my stories will be about GSP or GSP people. I don't care.

I'm a bit pissed though because no one from my school enjoyed it nearly as much as I did. Everyone I've talked to from other campuses is either happy to be home or dying to get home. The most common sentiment I hear is ""It was really cool, I'm just glad to be back."" I can't even comprehend that. All of my post-GSP time has been spent either focusing on school,talking to my best friends (hint: not friends from home), or counting the days until I get to see them again. Pathetic? Perhaps. What I need right now? Definitely. 

Well, that was perhaps the least useful update ever. C'est la vie."

"event","I forgot that summer was so...ridiculously lethargic. I mean, I'm in the habit of doing nothing all day, but it was always nothing full of people...c'est la vie. Not much interesting has happened today, I'm still fighting to finish this silly paper of mine.

"event","The coffee refuses to leave my body, yet I still have not developed the urge to write my paper. It grows later and later...watch me get kicked out of my english class. What occurs to me is that since I am so nostalgic about GSP, things that happened literally hours ago now are something to look back on with sadness and joy. Let me analogize the development of my nostalgia to VH1:

Pre-GSP:Like VH1's old signature show ""Behind the Music"" and the newer ""I Love the 70s and 80s"" series, I once only took occasional trips down memory lane after great periods of time had passed, looking back fondly on what used to be.

During GSP: Since the five weeks there were the best of my life, I began (while still at Bellarmine) to reminisce about things that had happened early on in the program. This is kind of ""I Love the 90s"" period in my life, when I was already reliving something before the memories had faded enough to be called long-term.

Post-GSP (Now): Welcome to my life as a ""Best Week Ever"" reminscer. I know mope over things that happened hours ago, things no one even cares about yet, things that by all right should be left to ripen until they have proven they can stand the test of time. Oh well, let's relive them now with... 

Bits of Conversations that Remind Me How Much I Love my GSP Friends:
le satyagraha: how're you holding up
Beckita8: like the leaning tower of pisa
Beckita8: you?
le satyagraha: like the remains of the coliseum
Beckita8: i miss yoga
Beckita8: how can you miss yoga
le satyagraha: i did it today
le satyagraha: i'm not going to lie...i reached that low

skrumdidlyumcias: yeah- it just came to on the back of a flying llama

HoboPeteVII: people dont get gsp
HoboPeteVII: someone was like so u learned about government?
HoboPeteVII: haha
HoboPeteVII: i was like no
HoboPeteVII: i learned to dance
HoboPeteVII: and lose weight

Beckita8: im going to pretend you didn't tell me that and ignore it forever
le satyagraha: i apologize...i just had to share it with someone who would appreciate the gravity of the situation
Beckita8: well im glad to be the chosen one
le satyagraha: of course
le satyagraha: it is a burden...you're like spiderman

HoboPeteVII: wheres ed...oh my god he isnt herrrrre
le satyagraha: my mom got me these turtle earrings
le satyagraha: and i was like ""eddddy!""

skrumdidlyumcias: can i invite people who don't have yahoo accounts?
le satyagraha: i'm not sure
skrumdidlyumcias: we really know nothing about computers

le satyagraha: my blanket is raunchy...like its been in the van and in frazier and in the yoga room
le satyagraha: but when my mom offered to wash it i was like ""hey! that's had paul and becky and brandon on it, dammit!""
Beckita8: hahahah AW
Beckita8: i loved that blanket
Beckita8: dont' wash it
le satyagraha: i won't
Beckita8: or at least cut off a piece of it and leave that piece unwashed
le satyagraha: sweet
le satyagraha: and then i can take it and get paul cloned
Beckita8: with his bear genepool
le satyagraha: and the scientists will be all ""uhhh, it came out with bear features, we might have f-ed it up""

I'm sure you cared about that."

"event","So...I've finally done it. After literally years of bashing LJs and all that they stand for, I made the plunge. GSP sent me into a tailspin of wanting to keep in touch with everyone and let them know what's going on with me and I decided that this might be an easy way to do so. I doubt that I'll post too much, especially once school gets started, but its a nice thought.

Anyway I was supposed to spend all of tonight writing an (increasingly late)aplit paper, but as soon as I signed on i started talking to Paul, Becky, Susan, and Kayleigh and it all went to hell. I then had to update the myspace (another thing I never thought I would get until GSP ended), return my massive load of email correspondence, work on uploading my maniacal amount of pictures, and then since it was already one in the morning I thought...""hell, make a journal."" So as you can see, I was far far too busy to actually do something I was supposed to do. 

In other news, I saw The Island tonight. It was approximately the best movie ever. By best, I mean worst...if Kelsey and I didn't make every situation hilarious, then it would have sucked. It was one of those awkward summer flicks that tries too hard to be political/intellectual and it had this whole pro-life, anti-cloning agenda that freaked me out because at the end I was like ""Free the clones! Don't abort life!"" and then I thought ""Shit...I believe in choice!"" It was also weird because it had all these people with serious indie cred (Ewan, Scarlet, Steve Buscemi, that dude from In America) and it was so, so random. I think it was probably a situation where they thought the script would be good and then someone edited it to hell. C'est la vie. However, since I only went to see Ewan McGregor, it paid off because he played the dual roles of 1)Some rich douche and 2)Said rich guy's clone. It definitely contained an argument between the guy and his clone that was something along the lines of ""I'm the real Tom Lincoln."" ""No I'M the real Tom Lincoln."" Look for it among movies to be nominated for all sorts of accolades when award season rolls around.

I have several, several cups of coffee in me as I'm sure is obvious by the rambling, so I suppose its now time for me to begin my paper. It feels like junior year again, with the all-nighters. I'm just riding out the GSP-induced depression thing for as long as possible before my home friends and family expect me to function in the real world. We'll see."

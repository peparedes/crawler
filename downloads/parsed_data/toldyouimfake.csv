"event","ah yeah two days ago i got to school really early, and my ex boyfriend andrew was there. well we talked for a minute and then he hugged me. It wasn't a normal hug, but one of those ""wow, its so warm and fuzzy"" kind of hugs. Too bad he cheated on me.
Anyway...after school today...i was going to get my daily code red, you know. And he was walking behind me and i kinda turned and he was RIGHT THERE, and he had something in his hand, but i didn't really pay any attention to it...and i kept walking. well i turned my head sideways a little and he was still there and he was holding something in front of my face.
doesn't matter what it was...but he kissed me on the cheek and then just turned around and left.
Interesting.
And i told kara about what exactly is happening to my heart and mind. She saw it coming, it seems. She knew i'd get more serious one day. The time has come.

And..im jealous. jealous of stephanie, jealous of edgar, jealous of rick, jealous of brandon, jealous of kara, jealous of cody.
Katie won't talk to me when she's with stephanie. And thats all the time. 
My best friend...is pretty much gone now.
Don't get me wrong..we still talk everyday. But its not like it was.
Things change. All she talks about now is Stephanie and ...well all the guys who like her. let me pull out the list.
1. nick
2. clayton
3. matt
4. mat
5. edgar
6. rick
7. everything other guy i haven't named.
Everyone thinks she's hot now. And well im not jealous because they don't think i am. Because i couldn't care less. My heart has been taken, but i've lost my best friend, and i think it's for good.
What do i have left now...
and Brandon. Brandon loves incubus now. I let him borrow my morning view sessions dvd and some incubus cds, and ....well, i haven't gotten them back yet and he keeps talking about incubus. Before...he hated them.
Seems to be different now. 
No one likes ""Here In My Room"" like i do, except you, for some reason.
im not really sure why, considering its one of the best songs ever.
I didn't ever sleep last night. I was talking to marcus and drawing pictures with my eyes closed for him. He did the same. it was fun.
as it could get, that is.
If you really pay attention there are so many hidden meanings in what i say.
even what i do.
even where i put my punctuation.
but you'd never notice that would you?
no i think you wouldn't.
Maybe..maybe you won't, but maybe, im not talking to you either.

Onto more...accepted things.

1st: Labs...well i don't feel bad about them anymore. We finished the vector lab, which took us an entire day, and since tina and ben's group didn't have that (it was the hardest lab) and they had two other ones that me and kaela don't have, we decided to cheat a little. Which isn't really cheating because we have permission. now. so collisions lab, and tension labs are fixededed. good.

2nd: Quiz. did terrible.

3rd: Test, ended up writing my critique during lunch AND the class. I finished two minutes before the bell rang for 4th period. damn, im good.

4th: more projects. conceited as it may be...mine was so much better.

Kara left early, so i didn't get to give her what i was going to after school, but katie and rick and stephanie and edgar and someone else were talking after school. I just handed katie our notebook and walked off. she didn't notice. go figure.

So now im sitting here with the two things that make me happy. well...one thing, and im waiting for the other but will probably have to wait til later.
code red, and you.
you could mean anyone by the way.
but i doubt it does.

g'bye."

"event","Law keeps talking to me more and more.
He's so amazingly funny and i never want to stop talking to him once ive started.
You've seen his entry in my ""friends"" on this thing.
You'd never guess how we met. 'twas interesting.
He has better hair than anyone ive ever seen in my life.
You can ask him, he might admit it.  

his AIM profile says:

""P.s. Macey is Teh Hawt""

well bye."

I bet you do *kicks you in the shins and hides you in a ditch for later*
You never will dear, never ever.
*bows* Thanks,

This is the song that describes how i feel.

This party is old and uninviting 
Participants all in black and white 
You enter in full-blown technicolor 
Nothing is the same after tonight 

If the world would fall apart 
In a fiction-worthy wind 
I wouldn't change a thing 
Now that you're here 

Yeah, love is a verb
Here in my room  
Your love is a verb
Here in my room  

You enter and close the door behind you 
Now show me the world seen from the stars 
If only the lights would dim a little 
I'm weary of eyes upon my scars 

If the world would fall apart 
In a fiction-worthy wind 
I wouldn't change a thing 
Now that you're here 

Yeah, love is a verb
Here in my room  
Your love is a verb
Here in my room  

Pink tractorbeam into your incision 
Head spinning as free as dervishs' whirl 
I came here expecting next to nothing 
So thank you for being that kind of girl 
That kind of girl 


and you STILL don't understand me, muahahaha."

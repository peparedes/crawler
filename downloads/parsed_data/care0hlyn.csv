Liz and I went and saw The History Boys. Love love love them. Oh, how I wish there were more boys like them around. Cute, intelligent, sexually-curious boys. Christina came over on Saturday and we spent the whole day together graffiting in my backyard, going to Arik's house, hitting the swap meet and buying dinner at Vons. Did you know you need to be 18 to buy spraypaint? I gave the guy my driver's license in the hope that he wouldn't be able to count, and unfortunately for me the public school system actually does work and he figured out I was 17. In the end, we dragged Arik out of bed and made him buy us spraypaint. 

Christina left for New York City tonight :[. She better remember to bring me back the most  touristy-hideous-I heart NY-Statue of Liberty-mug. 

I am however, excited for break.
Movies I want to see:
Children of Men
Volver (friday with Liz!)
The Queen

Books I want to get:
Little Children

I am so excited to see Children of Men - I've been waiting for this movie for so long. Ya gotta love Alfonso, Y Tu Mama Tambien anyone? Note to self: Must also get Little Miss  Sunshine on dvd : ).

I haven't had a full night's sleep since Wednesday, mostly because I want to get all my shit done and mailed to NYU before the second week of December. I'm making good progress I think, I have about 8 pictures I really like and the rest are mediocre. C'est la vie.
I've been extremely angsty for the past few days, mostly because we've had about 3 blackouts so far and all the electricity in my room completely shuts off - I've had to redo several pictures because of lost work. I basically look like shit and I'm a nervous wreck because I'm scared that at any moment the electricity is going to go out. Stupid Santa Ana winds.
I'm really on edge because I've been working on this stupid portfolio for the past few weeks and haven't had time to write or work on any of my essays.. and they're all due January 1st. ughghghhghgstress; plus on top of that, I just failed another religion test because I didn't have time to skim the info. Flunking religion? What on earth! 
I'm just so tired and I have so many things in such a little timeframe and on top of everything, I just realized that I don't have enough pictures for my portfolio. I guess it's my fault for changing my major at the last minute and having to start an entirely new portfolio. My fickleness will be the death of me. Oy vey!

It took me a total of about four hours to finish. The setting is a house from Newport Beach, Lido Isle. I know it looks like it's poorly edited, I just got extremely lazy by the third hour.

I'm just going to say: good conversation, good music, and a great friend = a nice mini-road trip. She took me to the cutest vintage shop where I took some great pictures and she found me a cute dress and belt which I am going to have to alter so it fits me. Afterwards, we went over to the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and we took in the Skins & Bones exhibit. It was beautiful, who knew architecture and high fashion could mesh so well together? 
L.A. really is beautiful, it's so culturally diverse I love it. Carolyn is happy when she sees skyscrapers :). 
We decided to head back early and pick up Liz and we all went to see a psychic. When I got my palm reading, I'm not going to lie, I was pretty depressed at what she told me. I don't know if I want to believe her or not, but she's been pretty accurate in everything in the past. It's just fucking depressing, and honestly at this point right now, I really don't want to believe it.
Afterwards, we went to Downtown Disney and got some food where I mulled over what the psychic told me. After a giant pizza slice and some chocolate binging we called it a day and drove Liz home through ghetto Santa Ana blasting 80s pop music/spice girls. People looked like/were going to kill us. 
After we dropped Liz back home, we decided to go to South Coast for awhile and see how Black Friday was coming along. People sure get testy when it comes to discounts. 
We went to Book Soup and just sat and looked at some art books. Christina found a book about the Skins & Bones exhibit and we were really happy because we just saw it! We decided we were going to learn how to graffiti over Christmas break, I mean I already know the basics on how to graffiti/make sketches, but I actually want to learn more about it and actually go hardcore. We're going to use the wall behind her house to practice on lol and make tshirts. =) Carolyn is also happy when she's being creative.

This day has been fabulous, Thanksgiving break has been fabulous. I do not wish to return to school on Monday or ever in fact. I took some beautiful pictures today of the skyscrapers in LA and tomorrow I'm going to take even more pictures. 

Do you know what else makes Carolyn happy?

Carolyn is also happy when she's with her best friends who make her smile.
Carolyn is also happy when she speaks in the third person.

I'm completely holed up in my own world right now, and for the most part, it's actually not so bad. I've rediscovered my love for photography. It's been so long since I've actually taken a picture for the hell of it. This Friday, Christina's taking me down to LA to go vintage shopping and to take some pictures. Saturday, me and Katherine are hitting some places to take even more pictures. 

Places we're hitting:
-The Lab
-Artist Village
-Newport Beach/Lido Island/the pier/PCH
-Trinity Church
-St. John the Baptist Church
-South Coast Repertoire
-Edwards Cinema (the run down one that's been closed for a billion years)
-Main St.
-That one apartment complex building that has the hidden fountain inside (we would have to jump the fence for that)
-the old south coast bridge
-the new south coast bridge
-Catholic Worker (it's so rundown but it's beautiful in every possible way)
-Old town orange (if we have time)
-SolArt Gallery Cafe (I'm not even sure if it'll be open on sat.)
-Bower's Museum
-suggestions are welcomed!

Why am I doing this? When I should be working on my homework and applications? Because I'm seriously considering majoring in photography at NYU. I don't know why I'm so fickle about NYU, it's only for NYU that I keep changing my major. Writing or photography? Either way I need a portfolio and I'd like to be prepared. Mrs. Wilson - best teacher, is letting me use the photoshop/illustrator programs so I can alter my pictures aka make em ""professionally artistic"". I like doing mixed media... so I'll probably do some weird shit on the pictures.

I'm so excited you have no idea. I refuse to become a tourist and visit the empire state building, times square, or take pictures of the broadway/wall st. signs etc. I have a whole lifetime to do those things, and right now, I'm just really excited to see the city in the springtime.
P.S. It'll be my first time ever in New York.
P.P.S. I wish to visit the littlest park in the city. 



Oh, how wonderful life is."

"event","I am being inundated with a plethora of shit. Meaningless shit that refuse to be flushed! (lols pun)

Tuesday: Physics test (DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL!!)
Wednesday: Propaganda skit - of course I get stuck in a group that refuses to rehearse
Thursday: AP Gov test (don't even know what the chapter is on; and of course this HAS to be the test that determines if I get to keep my A or not)

I got my report card in the mail, or rather I drove home super fast breaking all the laws of gravity just so I would be able to get to it before my mom does. I have a withstanding 4.0, I could have a 4.1 if physics would just cooperate with my brain. 

Man... first semester is really killing me. I don't have time to work on my applications and study. Plus the holidays are around the corner and I feel so guilty not having enough money to buy my friends presents. I was originally going to get a job, but clearly I won't be able to handle that. I had to miss Marco's birthday today because I just couldn't go, I had to work on my Emerson application. Holy hell, I felt so guilty. It's okay, I will make it up to him!! 


Despite all the stress, I still have things I'm grateful for/looking forward to:

Thanksgiving weekend/dinner:
-vintage shopping with Christina & Katherine in LA
-revisit the psychic w/ Christina... for personal reasons
-FINISH writing portfolio (fuck you writer's block!)
-gain weight

December:
-Stephanie's birthday
-vive la revolution!! 
-Amanda's birthday
-vacation
-no more applications

January:
-fresh start : )
-Corey's birthday


ahhh the holiday spirit is in the air. I like this time of the year, I enjoy the Banana Republic/GAP commercials, buying presents and wrapping them...I'm really excited. Here's to hoping that everything will be great and hopefully I'll stop procrastinating. 


Second semester, you can't come soon enough."

Me: *silence*
Mother: You're crazy to chase after this idea. You honestly think that people will read your ideas? You're Asian, nobody cares what we think.

"event","Last night I went to the Homecoming game, it was interesting I guess. The best parts were in the car when Katherine and I got completely lost and had no clue where to go. We ended up 20 minutes away from the stadium and couldn't find a U-turn anywhere. I honestly didn't give a rat's ass about getting to the game, it was just fun listening to some good music and getting lost with a friend. 
    We finally get to the game - and alas! There are no seats and no parking space, it's literally become like Texas here: buisnesses close down to go to the games and parents and alumni go crazy. I had to park my car illegally on the street. We were then forced to wait outside and stare at the giant jumbotron because they weren't allowing anymore people in at the moment. This year was unfortunately sucky for me, unlike last year, where I watched up from the balcony. I couldn't go up there anymore because there were news crews there. Crazy ass huh?
    We finally got seats during halftime, just in time to see who won Homecoming Queen. Lauren Lee won, which really surprised me because I thought Christina was going to win. Uh, cheers to her? I think that's the right etiquette on congratulating a Homecoming queen. After all the formality was done, and after all the hassle of getting to the game and trying to find a parking space - Mater Dei lost.
    As I struggled to get out of the gdamed crowded parking space, I cranked up the tunes and Katherine and I just started singing along to some of the cheesiest tunes ever. Uh, ""Everlasting Love- Natalie Cole"" anyone?? 

To sum it up:

parking space: $5
water: $3
jack in the box: $4.75
seeing Mater Dei lose it's homecoming game: priceless




Cheers!I'm off to work on college apps and watch ""Running with Scissors"" with Liz.Yeayuh Augusten Borroughs."

"event","Last night was the Senior Masquerade and I didn't go. I do not understand this need to ""do every senior activity because you'll never get another chance to"". I've been to one school dance and that was freshmen year, so I don't see why people keep urging me to go to more. Homecoming is  next weekend and instead of going and being surrounded by people I dislike - I'm going to be studying for the AP Gov midterm. lol, okay.. I just read what I wrote, and even I'm pointing at myself right now and shouting ""loser"". 
I'm beginning to write more and more in this LJ - for purposes unbeknownst to me. Maybe because I'd like to chronicle this hectic time in my life for future reference, or maybe I just plain old like procrastination. I'm doing poorly in school, physics makes my head hurt and everytime I check my grades online I cry at the sight of the C, AP Gov is such a little bitch because I'm so close to an A but can never seem to get it, and Yearbook is actually starting to get hard now. I can no longer ditch and roam the hallways, I actually have to work now. That's what you get for being an editor.
     My english teacher is a screwball. We're reading Catcher in the Rye in english which I've already read years ago and it remains one of my favorite books ever, but this woman makes me want to rip the book up. She acts like she's still 21 and flirts with all the football players and manages to butcher Catcher for me. Oy vey catholic school teachers!

"event","I've been thinking about a lot of things. I'm just going to release it all out in here because not a lot of people know about this livejournal. 
     I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't get into any of the colleges that I want. I'm scared that I'll end up at Cal State Fullerton and have to spend another two years here. I can't do it; this is my window of opportunity and I can't let it close. I'm so goddamn scared about everything. A friend once asked me what I was expecting to find in New York, and I told her everything. Maybe I've overly-romanticized New York to an extent, but that's all I have. The thought, the idea, the dream of me being in that city has loomed at the back of my head for four years now, it's haunted me at night and controlled every action that I've done. 
     I believe in second chances, I just don't believe that God grants them to certain people. The last seventeen years of my life has been waiting for this moment, and all I want is a goddamn acceptance letter to take me somewhere so I can finally start living my life. I have nothing left in California. I've felt lost for a very long time now, I'm not the same person as I used to be 5 years ago. People have told me that I've changed so much, and I wholeheartedly agree. High school has been a waste, my family is a joke, and my lack of personality has slowly faded. I haven't felt anything real in a very long time.


I have no idea how I feel right now. I'm just this mixture of emotions and everything is just shot to hell. It just fucking saddens me so much whenever I rummage through the LJ communities or myspace groups and read all the bulletins about the Eugene Lang or NYU students, because they seem so... content, and all I want is to be one of them and be content. It's just so ironic because I talk about wanting to leave so much and how I can't wait to see fall or snow, but in the back of my mind I can feel my future. My future is community college because my family can't afford anything else. 


Story of my life.



P.S. If you've perhaps clicked on this page and happen to know who I am, don't hold this post against me, I'm just really sad right now."

     Eh, I just finished my college essay, took me about two drafts, several trips to Wikipedia.com, and watching Annie Hall over and over for some witty repertoire. It's about 1,000 words long, so I'm thinking I might want to go back and edit about 500 words out. All this college shit won't even matter in the end, cause lord knows I'll probably end up at OCC to 'save money' or Cal State Fullerton. You know who I really admire? James Frey. Why? Because the guy is scum, told a lie, made six figures a year for writing a crap novel, pissed off Jesus oh whoops I mean Oprah, and that so-called book was even going to be made into a movie (which I'm pretty sure the fat-cats in Hollywood gave it the red light). The guy is my hero. Long live the under-average being that makes money for doing absolutely nothing! 

I will write a book, it will be called ""LIFE SUX"" and in two years it'll be made a made-for-t.v. movie and all the scene kids will make it into an instant cult hit, and I'll be famous amongst the skinny jeans generation! 

How's THAT for a career, Mother?"

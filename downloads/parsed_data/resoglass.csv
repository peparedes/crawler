"event","its allllllll so irrelevent these thoughts that come to my mind but hey 
shit goes way bac an it ALL WAS NOT safe but what is ,one must take
that step to learn an this ""step"" is not just once to happen 
i once had a dream it may sound silly or indirect but  but i dont care listen well i was crossing a endless path of barb wire which
i crossed wiht the assistence of a old women like in her 60s or 70s
an she was telling me were to go AN I TOLD HER HOW DO U NO SO WELL this path of torture an she told me i been threw it all an the women showed me her wounds of crossing it daily an i became so scared an felt sorry for the women but then i started to realize that that crossing was all of what life had to bring it was horrible an this women just smiled an told me just go when u get to the other side we'll meet an drink some coffee an eat cookies an i said again why is life so great i dont no why i said that but i had to as i saw the womens face expression an i stodd toward the large field of barbwire that stood tall hey when i make this i'l have some of the great dark awakeining  of a cup of coffee an the sweet taste of fresh cookies in life an i thought this sweet awakening will come asson as i complete my mission it all may sound very fictional an make belive but its just a represantation of what my dream meant the old women was an angel guideing me who had reached her final point .the mind of all is not quite tuned to the same level thats why we are different an the knowledge of the universe is stored away well but those who see things wrong an need help, is because there falling from the torture of the barbwire .. can someone help them  but wiht care of course cause the blood that seeps from them is bad blood that has come from a cut of this hell, karma comes form all who decide to stand the whole way an those who choose to fall an not go on an the rest u no
but w/e what im trying to say dont hold bac even if whatever ur faced wiht is the hardest thing in the world dont give up on it
cause remember theres fresh coffee an fresh cokkies on the other side
;) its ur choice` there is so much fucking irony ,oh my computer just started talking to me out of nowere right now it sounded like a black women but i could be wronng it was the scariest thing ahh i dont no how an i dont no why im freaked out but w/e im gona go now"

i never see whats right , im  just falling all over the place
look at me becoming just insane,wonder if i'll ever ..ever escape

my eyeballs are in place, but should they really be stuck on my face
i only use them twice ..twice a day..once to face my fears an  to shed my tears...

i'll try to regret an try to forget
cause my life's turning toward..toward space...
sigh.. can somebody buy me a spot on this earth , all to my self an nothing else.
also ""please"" a punch..a punch to my head to forget everything i delt with once before..

An if i live the same forever as today
i'll just cover my face for the rest of my days
but even after ""All"" ..ALL THIS MESS
I'LL STILL HOPE FOR THE BEST
even if i cant rest.....

so im thinking about what to do next..
i'll just lay on down my cold bed
pass away to this dream world ""i love""
maybe i'll find some answers ...today

but you know i think if i dream 1,000 dreams tonight
i still doubt i will......."

cause i noticed i am pretty gullable
when i see someone very trustworthy i think there ideas are perfect an listen
 to theri ideas 100% instead of listening 
to my self but there not at all 100% but who 
doesnt trust someone u care about an always helps u
well u should but  i dont think  completely
cause u never no that person can be stabing 
u in the neck by behind not for sure but could be possible
not being paranoid or maybe i am but im just gona do
stuff on my own from now on

so this is a new thing for me trust myself
an nobody more unless its some guidence or something 
but not fully go by anothers ideas cause they 
could be completely wrong an i have
 bad experiences ,it has done me no good 
an im sure this is another lesson im learning 
in this process .... 
im going to sleep soon thats for sure...

 feelings that'll make u wish u were to fall an die

only if the   pain in ur heart will go away

does this feeling hurt more than loseing  what u once had
its sad cause when it hits u bad
your shot there..theres no way to get help
u'll never win  or be satisfied
so say goodbye an dont cry an hide ur bullet wounds well

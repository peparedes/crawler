"event","doesnt the day sink when my teeth rot from the pleasures of the sweet.  My days now are choked with the stench of betrayal and disappointment.  day in, day out, i live in perpetual agony.  it doesnt seem as good as it used to be. the luster is gone and polish isnt going to bring it back. you often see your dreams smashed by what needs to be done, the things you always wanted to happen never will.  

heaven doesnt exist.  there is no higher sanctum reserved for the likes of me.  weary now, i stumble on, devoid of emotion or fear.  life was said to be so precious, and yet i would take it as if it meant little more than nothing.  it all just seems so pointless when youre always walking but never nearing the end of the road.  you always seem to be waiting for a rest stop, but youre never given the pleasure.  

im not sure what to do now, my love is slipping, my intelligence is getting mauled away, and the dreams that made me run have now only made me stumble and fall.  grace is just a lie to make you believe that there is hope.  hate, greed, punishment, and sin... they are my only friends now, may the devil take my body and waste it as he may.  ive lost my standing in the world and my pedestal has been shattered... the cold runs through me as i wither in the snow.  

it all just seems like a lie, so pointless, so difficult, all for nothing... why cant i find my resolution?...why cant i have my great awakening?... is there no messiah for me?... have i been abandoned for a race that knows no common sense?... drop the ropes, i know you not... for the future, you only know a sense of my terror... greed, hate, pain, sin, shame, bigotry, lies, and fear... pull yourselves to this worthless heap, i will not faulter again....

"event","a pale air amongst your hair, wind brushes as soft as it should.  The signs of the wall grow nearer every moment, the black nears still.  All images have a khaki lens pasted over their usual stream of light.  The smell of nothing slips by your nose as the sound of a silent bird catches your ear.  With your arm thrown over a piece of solid object, you transgress your sighted vision.  You catch their eyes, it's like they know what you feel, they share your pain.  Like they've been with you through every second of agony, the sadness is plain, a stale doughnut, past its prime, with nothing left to do but rot and be tossed aside.  Capture a breath, it'll cast you down.

    Well, im probably gonna be on probation for a year now... starting on november 30th.  I went to court today and, obviously, they denied the alternate punishment... so i go back for a sentencing on the 30th of november... then my advisor said they'll give me 12 months probation minimum...that means, curfew at 7 p.m., i have to check in with my officer at 7 each night, i have to attend school everyday, i cant get any referrals, i have to keep my grades up, i'll probably have about 35 hours community service... and, a bunch more stuff.... this sux..... i wish i had my love with me.... i had to take all my jewelry off (so my dad said) but i still kept on my ring she gave me... i was twirling it around nervously and reading it like a thousand times while i was in the courtroom.... this really sux... i just wish i could see her right now.... i miss her.... well..... im out..."

"event","Sanctum behold, our never-ending sight
bring traces of life back to the surface
you, in my head, trail slept to ending
suffer, smother, capture the light

eyes as a grass blade, dew glistens in the sun
hair like charcoal, powder sweeps off like soot from a fire
your hands, scraping at my chest, clawing your way through
it releases its pain through anger, a single blow to destroy

an empty city, roads all barren
the skyscraper crumbles and falls
pavement breaks under your feet
an immortal whim to your deceit


heaven holds no bars
hell traps not the willing
cadaver you remain
whilst my blood fills your veins

I've tried to make sense of this bullshit being fed to me, but the thoughts just keep their barrage just as strong.  I've stood at the pearly gates and demanded leniency, but i was denied the pleasure.  So it seems that i just have to say fuck it all, who cares what my schizo' mind tells me.  Doesn't mean i have to listen to it.  I guess that from being dropped on my ass by all these other people, now i have a paranoid delusion that everyone now will do the same.  I would never be like them, I'd never abandon them, so why did they have to shun me aside like i was so worthless.  Fuck it, fuck it all, who cares.  I don't have to listen to him anymore, he doesn't tell me what to think anymore.  I'm tired of being a paranoid little psycho, and i'm tired of never saying what i really want to say.  So, i'll damn them to the flaming shit they sent me to so long ago, i've risen from the pit only to throw me assailants to whence i came from.  So, with no further rambling... fuck daryl, fuck ben, fuck nathan, fuck josh, fuck john, fuck anybody that tossed me aside... and most of all, fuck you deadwing, you tell me what to think and do too much, now that's all over... stand aside... i think im gonna drive for awhile <smirks>....there... it's done....  i feel much better now...."

"event","well...yesterday i got to see my beloved, anticipation grew as we travelled down the road, turning a corner, my stomach ached with eagerness.  The sign we passed distracted me only for a moment.  We came to her house, i stepped out, putting on my boots as i exited.  We walked up the walkway to the door, i say to jules, ""hit the door.""  he wraps once, no response.  We wait for about a minute or two, then, about to leave, i spot morgan in the window, relief streams through me.  She opens the door and begins wheezing in a most unhealthy sounding way.  Apparently she had caught something from swimming the day before, although my sympathy was with her, i was still at a blind wonder to where my beloved lay.  I hear morgan call for her, she rushes past me to go change, ""understandable.""  i say to myself.  A few minutes later she came back out, with a short explanation, i find that she too had caught the illness.  A hate for the god that had cursed her at this moment surged through me, but soon that feeling passed.  With short intervals of speech we soon decided to take a walk outside, she led, i followed.  the next hour or so was comprised of embraces and good times.  As we were walking back to the house her friend josh drove into the driveway, they sat an conversed for awhile, i put a word in every so often, he seemed like a likeable enough person.  About 30 minutes later he left, we all packed into julian's car to go to best buy so as to pick up the alice game for morgan.  Before setting off to the sore, we had to stop by julian's house, on the way there i picked up a pack of cigarettes, so that was a plus, unfortunately, my beloved doesnt like the evil cancer sticks.  So with her fairly upset, we set off to his house.  Within 15 minutes she forgave me and fell into my arms..... after that, something changed...

   a fear ran down my spine, i dont know why these thoughts filled my head at that moment, but they shifted my stance severly....  it was almost as if i saw the future, i shut my eyes only for a second, the images surged...  i saw my beloved doing something that made her seperate from me, the feeling of an ackward hate was felt in that split second.  I didnt know what she had done exactally, but she had been taken from me, she was still here, but she wasnt with me.  I felt hurt, destroyed... alone again, in the world with no purpose.  i was now afraid that this would come true, in an attempt to thwart these poisonus images i looked into her eyes...  i felt cold...

   Her eyes didnt have the depth that they possesed before, i felt far away, even though she was in my arms it was like we were oceans away.  when we reached julian's house i exited, going into his house, leaving my beloved to wait outside.  i needed to think, i need to sort this out, explain to myself that the images were bullshit.  i took a quick drink and went back out to the car... i dont remember what happened much after that, i know we talked some in the store, i got a game and a movie, and i was staring alot.

   That night, after me and jules were done playing x-box, i had a dream.  I dreamt that my father had left me for a woman, my beloved was nowhere to be seen, but i knew she was gone, and my mother had expelled me from her sight.  I was alone ... homeless again, i sat beind a store, cold and wet i sat and cried, a quiet anger was in me, but i had too much sorrow to scream... when i woke up, i was confused... i hope this feeling will pass soon, for if it comes to pass, well... i wouldnt be worth my own time... off into the dark i go once again, to meditate on the events that have taken place, perhaps i can decipher the images that i saw that day, or perhaps they are already clear... only time can smooth the ripples..... may the best be on my side....."

Grace had fallen, and she broke my fucking stereo, now im pissed.  is that sarcasim in my tone u ask, why yes, yes it is.  i greet u with a great joy now, for at ten in the fucking morning (this isnt the good part by the way) my obsesive compulsive step-mother was at the door, a shiver ran down my back as i opened the door to that high pitched, gitty voice that she would shreik at me with whenever she spoke... pure joy is felt now for sure u say.  hell no, fuck that, i was still pissed.  but now, i have this crazy bitch wanting to clean my house for no fucking reason, god, if u exist, id like to order one miracle, and make it snappy.  2 1/2 hours later...  a knock at the door, but who could it be, for nobody ever comes to visit me, probably just a damned salesman, i told them already, i dont need termite poison.  Alas, i open the door to find jules, my friend of friends, i figured he wanted help assembling his waterbed or somethin.  Until i opened the door just a bit more,and what do my eyes reveal?  An angel at my door, my beloved.  After shattering my heart only a day before, now she stood at my door, with open arms.  Praise be to whatever gods i worshipped that night, for i always dream of opening that door and seeing her, and on the day i needed her most, there she stood.  My thanks go out greatly to my good friend jules, im so horrible at expressing the way i feel, he helped me alot with it, thx again.  well...after i saw her, i stepped outside, she imiediatly came to put her arms around me, i felt sooo good, Like a homeless, dirty man taking a hot shower, maybe that's not a good comparisoon, but who cares.  the rest of the day was blissful, i saw nothing but her beautiful eyes all day, even after she left i could still see them, and i still see them even now.  o, and my friend tommy got 2 new guns, ill give the specs later when i get em, but i shot em....and they're kick ass, rock on...well..thats it...im out....."

"event","Alas... my tears have been found once again, i've not seen them since my early youth.  My beloved has expelled me.  My presence by her has been thwarted.  To what reason she did this, to what actual reason?  I asked her that, she replied, ""There isn't one, there is no reason.  I just need to straighten some things out, rethink some things.""  I ask myself, if not to help her through times such as this, than what good am i.  Uselessness runs down my back to rest upon my heels.  

  I had planned to surprise her that day, i always dream of her surprising me.  I would run to the door in hearing a noise, hoping it would be her, but it never was.  Perhaps i should do this for her, perhaps it will cheer her up.  When i arrived, she stood in her door... a dead silence, her mouth dropped and the look in her eyes was not happiness, rather, ""what the hell are you doing here?!?!?"" complete shock and disgust.  A good five-minute ackward silence took place, the only sound was her scraping the side of the house with a nail.  With my patience growing thin because i was not used to such a quiet hostility from her, and for no known reason either, she raised and finnally spoke.  She said, ""Joey, we need to talk...""  I knew what was comming, i hoped my preminition was a lie, but it would soon be proved to be far more true than i would ever want.  She said, ""I... I think we need to take a break...""  the look in her eyes was unmistakable, she didn't ever wish to see me again...

  I wanted to go home, but i didn't have a home anymore.  Home wasn't the house i lived in, it was where i felt safe and contet, until those few words were spoken, i thought home was with her, i was blind for making such a mistake.  She turned and left down the street, her friend asked me if i had somewhere i could go, as they were having company soon, and i would need to be leaving.  I said, ""I think i'm gonna take a walk...""  with that i turned, only to see her, ashley, walking up the path followed by two other gentlemen, both at least a year or so older than myself.  As i walked past them they gave me a look as to say that i didn't belong here.... i never shouldv'e left my cave  those years ago... i would trap myself in solitude for eternity if i could release the pain of my suffering.  She said she loved me, she loved me, and after only a month and two weeks, she drops me on the ground.  She lied, she didn't love me, she didn't want to let me in her world.  She just wanted to poke and prod at the scared little boy in the corner, poke him with a stick, see if he twitches, then run..... so that's what im gonna do.....im gonna run....i might be back in an hour or a year....i dont know....but i need to run......"

"event","there's a singular stream of pain that runs down my back.  It feels as if there's an ice-cold razorblade scraping my spine.  The cold shivers take over me.  My eyes take the pins ever piercing, as though they enjoyed such a torture...... w/e... it must be strange to think that someday i will someday cease to exist.  Where would i go?  The lies of religion string me along to belive that there's a heaven, and yet no matter what i hear, it all sounds like the truth doesn't follow the stories.  They are but that, stories.  Well, today there's a fair amount of frustration in me, as my beloved, Ashley, has been unable to be in my presence.  You see, one of her close friends was envolved in a serious car accident.  I wish to be able to help her through this, but she just tells me that she doesn't want to talk about it.  She locks herself in her room for days.  It's been almost 2 weeks since I've ever set an eye upon her.  I grow worried ever more with each passing second.  My thoughts rest soley on her happiness, but i haven't a clue on how to help her regain her joy.  Alas, days will pass, and all pain is healed with time, that seems all i can do to help......"

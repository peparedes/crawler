"event","I don't know why, but I want to let everyone who reads this know that I miss them. (Unless I've never met you. I guess I can't miss you if we've never met.)

Come to think of it, I <i>do</i> know why. I'm getting closer to someone I actually think about and miss every day. Almost every hour of every day, at least when I'm awake. As a result, I'm <i>much</i> more social and kindly disposed. Plus it's spring, so I'm wallowing in bunny sex endorphins.

As a weird corollary to this, I've lost my glasses. Everything looks airbrushed and beautiful. Without the acute feeling of points and hard edges intruding on my vision, my analytical glare just melts away. Cute girls smile at me when I'm not glaring at them. :P

(I'm reluctant to get replacements, as a result. I'm actually <i>happier</i> and a lot easier to get along with when things look airbrushed and soft. This reinforces my idea that my vision problems are psychosomatic. I <i>know</i> I can improve my vision with NLP-style reframing because I've been trying it and succeeding for short periods of time. I'm at a loss as to how the secondary benefits of my myopia should be dealt with, though.)"

I had a good weekend. On Friday I went with a bunch of people to a 1-hour open bar and then we wandered around SoHo looking for interesting places. On Saturday I went to Contempt and met a really attractive, interesting girl. Hopefully I'll be seeing a lot of her.

I also spoke to one of the people responsible for putting the event together, which is always rewarding. I'd like to be behind the scenes at subculture events myself, so learning more about them is useful and interesting. I really wish NYC had more, even for subcultures I'm not personally interested in. My suspicion is that there's more demand than there is supply, and that maybe a bit of inventiveness could easily turn small crowds into big ones and amplify the energy of the event at the same time."

I've been really unsocial lately, so I decided to go out to a club for some loud industrial music on Saturday. I felt like I was being brought back to life, so I might need to do that more often.

School is going really well. I'm finally starting to pick up Ancient Greek at a reasonable pace, after dragging through my first semester because I couldn't remember things.

I switched my major to computer science for a few reasons, mostly because experience with computational modeling will serve my interests better than anything else. I plan to take a hard look at bioinformatics when I'm closer to having a degree.

It's really sad that Robert Anton Wilson died. Like others, I sent the poor guy money when I found out he was struggling to pay rent, which ultimately made his death seem more personal somehow.

My divorced parents took me through the route we used to take to the park when I was 3-4.  The actual terrain was completely bizarre.  We walked next to a swamp with a tree whose roots were enormous and above-ground, stretching completely across the swamp as a natural bridge.  The roots were 6-7 feet in diameter.  As I walked on them, reaching different parts seemed to ""trigger"" events.  Suddenly bubbles would appear next to me and a fish would poke out of the water and say something odd before diving back under.  Once or twice, little pictures of Bugs Bunny suddenly appeared in the sky in front of me and sort of jingled.  We got to some kind of cabin where the same thing kept happening.  I'd walk next to a basket and after a pause, a bunch of apples would pour out.  I'd walk next to a piano and a little tune would play.  I walked next to a little room that branched from the main one and a door pushed me further in, then a bunch of things happened at once.  Bugs Bunny appeared again with that same jingling sound, another piano started to play, things dumped from barrels and baskets, papers in folders swayed back and forth, and I think the window opened and closed a few times.  It was all really strange.  It wasn't like there was a poltergeist, it was like a bunch of invisible children were just showing me what the things could do.  Except for Bugs Bunny - I don't know what was up with that.  Or the fish.  If you've ever played one of those ""shooting games"" like they have at the Mall of America, where you ""shoot"" targets and then something happens (shoot the target next to the beaver and the beaver moves, shoot the target next to the clock and a bird pops out, shoot the guy at the piano and he starts to play it, etc) the whole feeling was a lot like that.  Everything had a mechanical pause before kicking into action.</lj-cut>"

"event","Go see <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>!  It's maybe the most thought-provoking movie I've ever seen.  It reminded me a little of <i>1984</i>.  It's based on the Philip K. Dick novel of the same name.  There's something uncanny about the whole story, it's sort of chilling and electrifying at the same time.  Also incredibly funny, in a way.

My favorite part (taken from the book, but faithfully translated in the film):
<i>""--this guy,"" Luckman was saying, manicuring a box full of grass, hunched over it as Arctor sat across from him, more or less watching, ""appeared on TV claiming to be a world-famous impostor. He had posed at one time or another, he told the interviewer, as a great surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medical College, a theoretical submolecular high-velocity particle-research physicist on a federal grant at Harvard, as a Finnish novelist who'd won the Nobel Prize in literature, as a deposed president of Argentina married to--""
""And he got away with all that?"" Arctor asked. ""He never got caught?""
""The guy never posed as any of those. He never posed as anything but a world-famous impostor. That came out later in the L.A. </i>Times<i>--they checked up. The guy pushed a broom at Disneyland, or had until he read this autobiography about this world-famous impostor--there really was one--and he said, 'Hell, I can pose as all those exotic dudes and get away with it like he did,' and then he decided, 'Hell, why do that; I'll just pose as another impostor.' He made a lot of bread that way, the </i>Times<i> said. Almost as much as the real world-famous impostor. And he said it was a lot easier.""</i>

(I didn't think that story got quite enough emphasis in the film.  It leads into sort of a central concept.  I think he says ""money"" instead of ""bread"" in the film.)"

Hunter College accepted me (so says the admissions hotline - they haven't sent anything yet)

I'm going for anthropology, but I'll <i>really</i> be studying cybernetics, which is completely fascinating.  I want to figure out what cultures and subcultures and little backwaters of civilization are actually <i>doing</i> in the bigger picture.  Plus I want to figure out what it means for cultures to change.

This'll naturally branch out in to studying cults, religions, sex, drugs, pirate enclaves, The Free State of Fiume, and other strange wonders.  And burgeoning tribal structures in the modern US.  I'll promote the idea that tribes are a Good Thing(tm) (unless I honestly can't find any support) and figure out how they work best.

I walked ~11 miles yesterday due to a major issue with Google Maps.  Jones Beach Theatre is *not* at 1542 Wantagh Ave in Wantagh, NY.  It's actually in JONES BEACH (hence the name) roughly 8 miles south.  I power-walked it in less than 2 hours (my legs are still sore) and missed Peaches and the beginning of Bauhaus.

Also, I've realized that a *good concert* for any high-energy group requires a mosh pit.  I really need to be brutally assaulted by a sweating mob of thrashing people who're far more into the music than I am to be properly immersed in the show.

Maybe I'd do better in college if lectures had a mosh pit.  Maybe quantum mechanics needs a thrash metal treatment."

After that and other adventures, I had more fun in Astoria.  (It's a secret, but I did something interesting.)

I consider it likely that my car was intentionally damaged by the mechanic who looked at it and adequate forms of retribution are being taken into consideration.  (I don't know <i>for a fact</i> that the damage was intentional, but the service station was screwing with me and it seems incredibly unlikely that my engine would quietly break apart in the middle of traffic the way it ""apparently"" did.)  Also caught a play, which was nice.  It killed me, because I'm prone to that kind of thing in the right environment.  So in other words, my birthday wasn't a total debacle.  Which is good, because November 19th is generally the one day in a given year when my luck really goes to hell.  Not that it's really that bad - there's just usually one thing that seems to unbalance things in the direction of being unfortunate.  I've also been in the newspaper for having a birthday party at a nature center, and that was pretty cool.

The actual character he's speaking to, I'm fairly certain, doesn't see him again in the movie.  The viewer, however, will see him at least once.  Possibly twice, but if and only if the viewer is paying attention to what's going on in the background during a party scene.  Which, I think, is part of what the whole movie is trying to combat on some level.  The guy behind the dumpster in the beginning is, I think, a warning on that level."

I'd sooner grunt like a pig than answer without meaning it.  I always examine the content of communication.  I wonder, how much is this like 'reading' the entrails of an animal?

This was relayed to me while I was in a business office on the moon, and another history report detailed how we were still living in the wake of the huge lunar cities being built.

""Do you have Civilization IV?""
""let me check... yeah""
""Do you have a lot of them?""
""yeah""
---
So I threw on some chainmail (I've got it for Halloween, thanks Karen, I decided that I might as well get a workout as I wander Manhattan) and stopped in for some home-made rice pudding (and, while I waited, a double-shot of 1800 - Lauren, someday I will introduce you to this!) next to the subway station.  So after the crawl to 34th streeth, I got out and found the place - it's at 33rd & Broadway in case someone wants to lob an egg or two for me.
""Do you have Civilization IV?""
""No, we sold out in like five minutes""
""I called an hour ago and they told me you had lots!""
At this point I think the guy realized he was the one who spoke to me over the phone.
""Oh.  Uh.  My supervisor just said we sold out.""

So I tracked down Firaxis (they apparently *had* an office in Manhattan) which was supposedly at 1841 Broadway and it doesn't exist.  So I muttered and crawled back onto the subway, slightly relieved at being able to sit down.  Chain mail is heavy.  Good workout, though.

And I still want that game."

Also glanced the guy who saluted and <i>shalom</i>ed me the day before Yom Kippur.  I feel bad about that, now.  I assumed it was some jerkoff who wanted a dollar and was hoping I was Jewish and would respond favorably to such a greeting.  I saluted him back and started walking into the store, but then he called out ""no, wait!  how are you?"" and I said ""I'm just fine"" as I kept walking.  He didn't follow me in, but the more I thought about it, the less likely it seemed that he wanted my dollar.  Strangely, today, he came up to the front door - I thought he must be a neighbor.  But he just looked in for a second and then went on his way.  I kind of wanted to say hi.
(I wish I could've recalled what <i>shalom</i> meant, I had no idea it's a standard greeting.  What would've happened if I said it back?  It seems so secret, Hebrew on the streets, idunno.  I guess I just never heard it in real life, it's one of those languages I've only heard in movies.  Welcome to New York.)

I love New York.

(I still find it weird when people make comments at work about October being a Jewish holiday as the reason for there being no work for us to do.  Only there <i>isn't</i> any work for us to do and we're getting emails about law offices being closed and borrowers being on vacation because they're Jewish.  In Minnesota, drawing a correlation like that would've been as bad as using the 'n' word in regular conversation.  Nobody here seems to find it strange.)"

One of the impieties of Tantalus, according to Pindar, was that he offered to his guests the ambrosia of the Deathless Ones, a theft akin to that of Prometheus, Karl Kerenyi noted (in Heroes of the Greeks). Circe mentioned to Odysseus that a flock of doves brought the ambrosia to Olympus.

Derivatively, the word Ambrosia (neuter plural) was given to certain festivals in honour of Dionysus, probably because of the predominance of feasting in connection with them.

""Ambrosia"" is related to the Hindu amrita, a drink which conferred immortality on the gods.

Many modern scholars like Danny Staples relate ambrosia to the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria."

"event","Interesting times.  My appetite is gone - this happens every year.  My lunch costs $2 - just a cup with yogurt & fresh fruit & granola.  On the upside, I'm getting nourishment elsewhere.

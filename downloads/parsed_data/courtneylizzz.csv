the whole thing was pretty weird, actually. i always wanted to be in a car accident, like not even joking. i always wondered what it felt like.. and now i know.
is it weird to say that it was the biggest adrenaline rush i ever got ?

eh, anyways.. all i know is that i definitely would have gotten hurt if i didn't have my seatbelt on. my head would have hit the front of the car really hard, if i wasn't wearing it. all i have, thankfully, is a headache.

yo, people amaze me, really. like, i never thought people could act like this but wowwwww.. was the fuck was i thinking !? people, please get over yourself and realize that you're not a somebody. YOU'RE A NOBODY. lmaoo. 


ughh i hate fucking drama. people are such immature babies. i love when people talk soo much game but i bet when they see me they'll be fucking silent. cool, talk as much shit as your dumb ass wants but ohhh myyy goshhh.. lay a fucking hand on me and it's down. 
i don't even care anymore. drama to me is meaningless. especially when girls start it but won't own up to it. fucking cool, you're a dumb ass and a shit talker. OHH and on top of that, you act as if you're miss perfection. ohhh yeahhh, smoking weed and piling on the makeup is fucking perfection, alright, cool... ughh. omg. if someone ruins a potentially amazing day next week.. i'm gonna be so fucking angry. i just don't wanna be around people who i know don't like me and will do anything to make themselves look cooler. gosh fucking dammit. i didn't wanna go in nfa with drama but fucking take a gander at the losers who ruin everything. GOOD JOB, ASSWIPES, YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY MADE SOMEONE UNHAPPY. :D oh but at the same time, you made yourself look like a fucking dumb joke.  :] soo, thanksss ?"

SOOO i start school on the 6th, which is next thursday; but this thursday is the nfa orientation. soooo that'll be interesting. :/ i hope i know people, hah. 
yesterday was sierra's birthday. i bought hats and tooter-flooters and we partied at her house. she's 15 now and pretty awesome still. 
krysta has been officially moved out for awhile now; idk if i posted that before or not. it's weird not seeing her every day. :[
i haven't seen larissa all summer, i really miss her. i hope we can hang out this weekend. 
amanda is going to hershey park this week which kinda sucks for me 'cause i won't be able to talk to her but it's good taht she's getting out of newburgh for a little while. :]


uhhh i'm tired.
good night.

i'm done babysitting and i successfully spent all my money on clothes and stuff at target.
school starts really soonn.. fucking weird, i'm not ready for this summer to be over with.


blehhh i'm in such a weird mood. i hate thinking about the past.. i was thinking and i realized that, i used to make up stories to get sympathy, because i thought no one cared and i wanted to hear remorse. why ? who knows. i can feel myself starting to do that again.. not that i want to lie or exaggerate but sometimes i just stop thinking and just start acting.
like, the other night i wanted to do a little ""experiment"".. so, i said i was in a bad mood in a bulletin and/or an away message (idr) and i wanted to see who would actually reply and see what's wrong.
guess how many people did !? zeroooooo. really cute, right ? nice to know that i can't fall back on someone when i'm down, but yet i'm always the person other people fall back on. i'm not a back burner bitch. if i help you out, i expect to be helped out in return. only common sense, duh. 
UGHHH i'm so weird; i hate it. 


amanda is coming over tomorrow. that should be fun, because she is one of my few actual friends. fuck everyone else, i really don't need a thousand friends anymore to keep me happy.. as long as i have my 4 best friends, my sister, and my dad.. i'm totally good. 
de'shawn finally came home from vacation. it was nice seeing him again. nice, but awkward. hahah. but he's actually going back to GA again in like a week. fucking lameee.
BUT larissa comes home, i think, monday. :D i miss her. i haven't seen her at all this summer. D: ew gay.
i started talking to *** again (i don't wanna write his name :D). it's weird, i miss him too much. i don't miss us being boyfriend/girlfriend.. but i miss my best friend. :[ i miss it sooo muchhhh. he was such a good friend and i just need someone to confine in again. D: yfjtgigks;h okay whatever.


i'm in a bad mood, so i'm gonna get off now and try to be happy."

"event","change can be a good thing, or it can be a bad thing.
i'm changing, my life is changing, and so are the people around me.

i'm going to nfa next school year. my sister is leaving home. i'm gonna lose friends and, hopefully, gain friends.
my life is gonna be so different than it was. i can already see the changes happening, and it's scaring me half to death.
last year, i wanted change. i begged for it, i cried over it, i needed something different and new. now, i'm gonna get it and i don't want it but i have to have it. all this is being forced upon me and i can't refuse. 
i have to go to nfa, i can't make my sister not leave, and i can't make people talk to me more or less. 

life is scary, the future is fucking terrifying. i'm not ready to grow up yet; i just can't see it happening now. 
am i the only person who is scared of life ?? i feel like i am; i never hear other people saying shit like, ""life is fucking scary, and i hate it.""
only i say that. i hate this, soo much. i never felt like this before. 

i was in a really good mood, then i get into one of my ""weird moods"" and i start thinking negative. but i can't help it, i really can't. i just want this all to be over with.. everything, and i know that if things don't get good next school year, it will be over with.
i'm done trying anymore. this shit is way too hard."

"event","so, yesterday was my science regents. i went to 3 review sessions, and i thought for sure i'd fail. i suck at science and the final was reallyyy hard. BUT today my science teacher called me and told me that i passed with a 71 !! :] it's such a weight off my shoulders because if i didn't pass it, i would have to re-take it during the summer. that would suck sooo badly. BUT I DON'T, SO YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYYYYYYYY.
also, i got a 69 and 72 on my social studies and english finals. :] and i'm pretty sure i passed my math one. i already know i did good on my report card; i'm just excited for it to come. i got like an 82 this quater in science ( which went up from a 60 ! ), an 89+ in english, i think an 82+ in math, and 75+ in social studies. so yayyyyyyy. :] 

this morning was the school's award ceremony. i got an invite a week or two ago and everyone said it's because i won an award. :] and i did !! hahah. i got the ""sterlling silve effort"" award. which would have been really awesome if it wasn't for 29 other kids winning it. ahaha. 

so, i'm offically done with south and i'm really happy about it. i'll miss all my teachers because they're amazing people but i know i'll visit. hah. but i'm really excited for nfa; hopefully it'll be even better. south was good.. jr high made me who i am today. all the bitches who tested my limits, all the friends who screwed me over, and all the boys who broke my heart... THANK YOU. it helped me learn more about people and more about myself. i'm glad it's over though. i need new experiences and i still can learn a lot more in a new school.

blehhh.. on a different noteeeeee. :] monday night i'm sleeping over sierra's house and tuesday we're going to danbury. hah, that's all we do... sleep and walk malls. ahaha. oh ! and i don't think i wrote that next month i'm going to be baby sitting my father's friend, geoff's, twin boys. :] i'm gonna baby sit them likee every week day, 11am-5pm. i'm gettin' mad moneyssssssss. hahah. i'm saving up for a new camera though, so i can't spend all of it. but i'll tap into my savings a littleeee. ahah. what can i say !! i need clothes.. and a manicure. hahah wow, i sound so materialistic; i love it. hahahh sikee. 

okay well, this is a very long update. i didn't think i was going to write so much; i just wanted to write like a little paragraph... but wow, i wrote like 4 ""little"" paragraphs. haha, so i'm gonna get going now. :] i'll update whenever.

AND THEN i have finals in social studies ( thankfully, we'll have review sessions 'cause w/o them i'd fail ) and then i have a science regents but ms.oberle fucking sucks at life so i'll probably fail those.

"event","well, i was right when i said that going over sierra's house would cheer me up. hahah. we had an awesome time. :] if you're reading this sierra, thanks girrl. love yaa <33
but, of course, when i got home my whole day was ruined because my sister was being a serious asshole. she started a stupid argument with me over nothing and it turned into something big and my dad got realllllly pissed at me. i was furious, so absolutely angry. i had a huge break down and ughhhhhhh. hahah. 
it was weird to feel like this again. i always used to get into hugeeee arguments with my mom last year and i was so horrible. i was thinking about it today, after i gotten into that fight, how i don't wanna be like that again. last year everyone was fed up with me. everyone was sick of my attitude and my bullshit. i never believed that i was really acting like that until today. i took a look back at my life and realized that i wasn't a good person last year towards people who were only trying to help me. ( well, some people. others deserved it ) i'm glad i changed; so fucking glad.

have you ever had one of those days when you just stop and take, like, half an hour to look at your life? and then you realize that THIS IS LIFE. we all only have one life to live and it could end at anytime. sometimes i'll be in the middle of a discussion, about anything, and i'll just think about how life doesn't feel real until you really think about it. it sounds weird but that's because it is.
right now i'm watching ""last days of left eye"" on vh1. in the last month of lisa ""left eye"" lopes' life, she took time out to change herself. watching this is really making me think about how i can change myself. it's a shame that such a wonderful and beautiful person, like left eye, died just when she was starting to enjoy life. i need more change. i can change me and i'm the only one who can change me. so, i'm going to use this summer as a life changing time. i'm going to work on my personality flaws and bad habits. this year, already, has changed me a lot. i've learned to live life to the fullest and i learned how to make better decisions. i've become more paranoid and worried because of some things that have happened but i think that last year, i was too carefree. i need to worry sometimes... but i do need to change the paranoia. i'm ODing with it. hahh. anywayss. i have a lot to do with myself this summer. wish me luck with everything!

i can only imagine how he must feel. i'm worried that he might have or will give up. people have actually died from a broken heart before, i don't want that to happen. ugh. i'm scared and i hate this. i hate being freakin' home alone at nights knowing that i have no one to care for; it's weird and no one understands it. 



school has been good though. only like 5 more weeks until the last day of school. :] i'm soo worried about report cards and finals and shit. it's scary to think that i'm actually leaving south. :] scary but awesomeeee.

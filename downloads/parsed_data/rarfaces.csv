"event","So I'm at my brothers. It's been a nice relaxing weekend. I got up at 9 this morning and started all my writing homework and got done at 11. Wooooot. That would have never have happened if I were at home. 

I changed the background and style, how do ya like it?

SO last night my brother taught me how to drive stick. I'm getting better at it. I know first and second gear pretty well. It's actually kinda fun, but I like driving automatic better. 

Elections are this week. Good luck to everyone! :) 

Sheena's birthday is Tuesday. What are we gonna do girlies??

I went to Dominoe's last nite and I told my brother that i would go in and get it. Well when I went to go get it, they told me that two free liters of sodas came with it. Being the smooth one, that I think I am, I thought I could handle it myself.... Well I dropped one of the pizzas all over the floor. I'm a dumby. 

<b>Thought Of The Day: Boys are just stupid, seriously. Like just watching them, I think to myself MORON. Hahaha. Screw boys. </b>

Peace out!

"event","This is really exciting!  Even more exciting, I actually have something mildly amusing to say.  So, if you read my last journal entry (in my journal), you know that I wanted to post some pictures, so I was trying to hook up my scanner.  Anyways, I went searching for my scanner, found it where?  Shoved under my sister's bed.  Stupid sister... Anyways, I couldn't hook it up, because the plug wouldn't fit anywhere, dang.  So, I went searching through this massive box of cords, hoping to find a match for my scanner.  No such luck.  So, I searched for around forty-five minutes, untangling, and wrapping/twistying these cords into an organized pile, but no luck.  Dang, teach me to play mad computer scientist again.  Ok, wasn't so funny, but like I said, mildly amusing...

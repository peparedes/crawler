"event","so in my head i think well lets see 20 yrs old and moved by myself down to south beach for the summer...pretty ballsy i think--ballsy?&nbsp; ne ways still have two more years of school left but seriously considering moving down here. who knows have prly a total of 20 dollars in my bank account left and i have one and half months left.&nbsp; yeah the parents are helping me big time- but im still pretty stressed about it.&nbsp; also im gonna go to some modeling agencies ---my dream right there. and really this summer will really i believe define the next couple years of my life which makes me pretty nervous.&nbsp; i feel as though im split right down the middle.&nbsp; miami one side and my life in michigan the other side.&nbsp; its just so different&nbsp;here than it is there.&nbsp; i like this life, but i would like it more if i had a steady job and income...not just an internship but im sure this internship would help me out--- i don't fucking know...

just thinking out loud."

just came ack from pattaya, the land flowing with beer and whiskey,(who cares about the milk and honey man..) where the camel walks on 2 feet(think about for awhile if you dont get it)...

not going to bother writing anything about it...

y? 
because some, or rather most of the stuff we did over there should not be written on the internet, considering that im still in the army and everything...

"event","hey ho....

watched a few DVDs since i last bloged. yesterday i watched american history X in the mess. its probably the fourth time i watched it and its still good, exept for the fact that among the guys that i was watching with, there was some asshole. pretending to be some sub-culture expert, giving a fucking running commentary on how nazi skinheads originated from germany...i hate watcing movies with louds ass ignorant twats, who think its their job to educate everyone around them about shit that know shit about....
there are no nazi skins in germany... Neo nazis are another stupid american product, just like the sitcom Friends... another fine example of american bullshit...

another show that i was watching was the untouchables.... pretty cool shit.. andy garcia rocks man.
kevin costner really sucks.

third and final movie, tupac resurrection... its a documentary on tupacs life... waht was interesting was that the whole cocumentary was narrated by him, nd it only just came out. now considering some of the things he said on the movie, and that he's been dead for ard 7 years, this is a really smart guy. should watch it for yourselves...


more news... 

ill be handing up my applicaton for an extension tommorow.. 
hopefully i can get more time here.."

"event","it suddenly occured to me that ill be stuck here for only four months more... this is where time starts to speed up a little bit. where you find yourself rushing to do things, and not waiting for the next week, or day...
it was not supposed to end up like that... i was supposed to stay here till i get sick of this place, then beg to be sent back.... looks like its happening too slowly. hopefully things will change in the next 4 months.

im going to miss this place...."

"event","now what the fuck is wrong with you people, do you really need to piss me off this way!!is 41 replies about feet an fucking fingers really neccesary? you all are fucking morons.... you really are...  its not funny anymore.. its not cute... its FUCKING ANNOYING!! i officialy hate you people... you people should just burn in hell for wasting my email space....

fuck you all man.....
the last time i was so pissed off by email was when some mega fucker wrote to the email circle about insurance sales techniqes. and guess fucking what? it was from the sam yahoo group as this one i'm ranting about now...i have never beeen so pissed-off by spam or other shit in my email b4.. i guess its because with spam, at least you dont know these people. you didn't associate with them, they came to find you. now with these guys, i am actualy guilty of knowing these retards at least once in my life... and very stupidly joining the yahoo group....

so here i am admiting my guilt..... and with guilt comes anger, white hot anger... 


on lighter note.... 
if you really need to find something to go on and on about something, and you happen to choose something more interesting then moving your fingers and fucking toes in the opposite direction, you might actualy get my interest, like this joker over here....

http://bacontarian.com/

a bacontarian by his defination is, - a person who supplements an otherwise normal diet with large amounts of pork

now this is cool... this is the real deal man... this fellow vegan hater goes on and on about eating pork.... 
okie its not that interesting but i sure as hell beats fingers and toes..."

if you intend to visit thailand anytime soon, DO NOT GO THERE!!!


something else i would like to say....

i was checking my email just now and guess what i find... 27 fucking replies on an email, something about moveing your damn feet in the opposit direction as your finger or something....
where do people dig this kind of stuff anyways? always thought thought they only did these kinds of experiments on chimps, what the fuck is wrong with these people? 
these people should volunteer themselves for medical testing, so that animal testing can stop, and there will be more animals around for eating...
fucking piss me off"

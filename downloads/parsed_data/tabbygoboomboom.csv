"event","Tab's never surprised when she watches the news and sees some horrible destruction, followed by ""former members of the team X-Force"". But the Civil War bullshit going on has made her at least pay some sort of attention. She knows the details the news has given her on Dom and 'Star's break into the 198. Which, all told, isn't all that much.

She hopes Dom's at her apartment, but she gets the machine. No idea when it'll be checked next. ""Hey Dom, up for good food and movies at my place? And by that, I mean I have three-day old McDonald's and found my neighbor's porn."" Sounds stupid saying it to her somewhat mom figure, but she needs to get her over. Discussing politics while slinging shit in the same direction, what fun."

"event","Since Star left she's been trying to figure out how she's going to press Mojo for answers. The fat bastard isn't anywhere around, or at least nowhere she's been since it happened. Supposedly things were said about Ric and videotaping the wedding. She just needs to find out who said what and who heard, which hasn't been easy with fighting the dragons in purple underpants job and all.

The apartment's a mess. She wonders how Ric's dealing with all this, if at all."

"event","I cannot be any more stressed out than I already am. Knowing I'm at this point is very interesting. Because it is here that men are either made or broken. I cannot be broken, so thusly...I will become made into whatever it is that men are made of. I can only hope that one day, my ineptitude will no longer be a factor in my day to day living. I am in the throes of typical college student-ville...I'm poor as fucking shit. I can't do ANYthing that I want. I have to save my money and pay bills. It's an incredible dose of responsibility and yet, I'm not even the one coming up with the bulk of the fucking money!!! My DAD still pays for things such as rent and, since it was cancelled on the first apparently, insurance. The thing that scares me most, my credit card. It's up to 2,500 bucks, it's going to probably surpass 3 grand tomorrow when I get my insurance back on to covering me. 

Fuck this shit, it's not bringing me down. I can't be brought down. I will rule it all because I'm better than this crap that's bogging me down. I will work in school and whup it's ass, getting straight A's. I will work at work and beat that ass too. 

I have to. 

I'm not being the best boyfriend, but I'm so desperately trying to get up there and it is SO frustrating. I miss her so much. I just want to be next to her. To feel her soft warmth next to me. It imbues me with strength that I find nowhere else. Nothing is too good for her. I just hope that she's able to get down here soon. Because I'm fuckin flipping out people. I hate being this stressed out, it's not in my character. I say that...but apparently it is, because I AM stressing out. I dunno. 

I'm entertaining ideas for making money that I never thought I'd be pondering before...it's actually pretty scary when I stop to think about it. Maybe that's a sign? Can't stop now...

I'm updating. This thing is hard as hell to keep up because it's a lack of caring sometimes. But anyway. I just got back from Bakersfield at about 7:30pm or so. I swear, there's always one thing that happens to my body when I drive; either my legs get all stiff and achy, my lower butt cheek (it's never both) gets all cramped as hell, etc. And I have to say, there are so many stupid-ass slow drivers who don't realize you're supposed to MOVE OVER when somebody is riding your ass waiting for you to fucking move. Seriously. It happens so much in certain cities. You could be bumping the bumper of the car in front of you in Bakersfield and NOBODY WILL EVER MOVE. And I don't even get road rage, yet this stuff pisses me off! It takes a lot of stupidity to piss me off and that's one thing that does.

In Bakersfield it was pretty fun. I got the warm fuzzies seeing my family again. I wish I could see my brother and sister more often, but I can't. That's the thing I dislike most about living here. I can't see my brother's football games, or talk to my sister, stuff like that. OH, on my first night there, I drank a few beers and had a good time talking with dad. HE ACTUALLY CURSED AS A CHILD PEOPLE. This is big fucking news since I've never heard him cuss really. He said bitch when he was pissed a couple times when he was arguing with my former-mom Mary, but that's about it. But that night was pretty cool. :) 

Umm...then while I was down there, I got to see the Bakersfield Condors hockey team rock some ass. I will say that they are the only Bakersfield team I give a rat's ass about. But let me get off on a jag here...there used to be a Phoenix team in the same hockey league as the Condors, but they folded. Which sucks, because now that I'm here, there's no hockey to be seen (at the seats that my dad gets) for less than trading your eternal soul. But anyway, it was so much fun. :) I finally got to wear my Philadelphia Eagles jacket and REPRESENTTTT the future Super Bowl winners baybayyyy. 

I stayed up late pretty much every night playing games and watching Howard Stern. He really is an interesting and funny guy. I saw some weird ass entertaining stuff like this porn star putting an egg between her butt cheeks and getting spanked by an auto-spanking machine. Good stuff. :)

I beat Half-Life 2!!! My brother got it for Christmas and I played the shit out of it. I must say that it is probably the best first person shooter (FPS) ever. It had realistic physics and everything! 

Another thing that happened was the acquisition of computer parts for my animation computer. First off, I HATE being the fucking black hole college kid that dad keeps putting money into not knowing if I'm even going to be a success! Argh, it's just a severe stress adder to me. We got these awesome parts ordered and I should be able to pick them up tomorrow. The only thing missing is the motherboard. It's on back order, which sucks because I want to build this thing and get it set up for my homework and stuff. I need to pirate some software before the semester begins!

I miss Shelby. It seems that I never really get to see her anymore. I saw her for about an hour and a half maybe before I drove to Bako, and that felt really good. I didn't even want to move when I was near her. It just felt good being next to her. :) ALSO, I want to kiss the hell out of her right now because I'm super horny. Yes, HORNY. And holy shit, I wish she was here. Or vice versa with me up there. I thought about us a lot when I was down there. I think that it's hard as hell doing what we're doing, because we never get to be there for each other. Like today for instance, Shelby ROLLED HER CAR ONTO IT'S SIDE. And I can't be there. That is incredibly shitty. I want to be there, but it just can't happen sometimes. Damn, I just wish I could see her. This weekend has the greatest chance of fulfilling that wish, unless the clouds just shit snow everywhere. THEN that will blow and suck at the same time. The feared combination is very frustrating. So, fingers crossed, legs crossed, balls, whatever...they're ALL crossed because I want to see her.

The rest of the stuff in Bakersfield was uneventful. I saw my buddy down there a couple times, we caught up and it was good. I won't see him until next year around this time, which is weird to think about.

I got to see my puppies and kitty!!!!!! I drove over to the whore's house and undid the gate chain, being totally and utterly quiet. I stealthily walked back behind to the backyard to check for people or my puppies...saw nothing. So I crept back to the side door that led into the garage. I opened it up and saw no truck, so I went to the house door and popped that bitch open. Penny and Ginger started barking until their dumbasses realized it was me. Penny and Ginger are so cute. Ginger just wants attention and when you stop, she raises her paw for more. :) And Penny just waggles her butt and flips over on her back so you can pet her belly. lol, I miss my puppies :) I pet them for a bit before I noticed MAX. My bad-ass black and white kitty. I pet that pretty boy and sniffed his fur (a Josh ritual). He always smells so good. I swear, he could be rolling in the dirt and he still smells like a kitty flower or some shit like that. But I was petting the pets and unbeknownst to me, my little bro was there, so he tried to scare me (failed) and we had a good time for a bit. Apparently Mary leaves for her stupid classes at 8 and doesn't get back till 3. So that was a cool window of opportunity. Although surprisingly, I only screwed with her mouthwash. I won't say exactly what because it's gross. Although people have laughed everytime someone tells someone new. I dunno. I'll just leave it at she'll have to rinse with a fresh bottle once she uses the stuff I fucked with. 

So that was that. I'm tired of writing so I'll just stop after this; I went to the puppies the day I thought I was going to leave and said my goodbyes to the Maximus kitty and then I stole a Dr. Pepper from the whore's fridge. And then my radiator self-destructed while I was getting Taco Bell. So I had to pay 300 bucks to get it fixed. Then I came home. The End. lol, there's more, but my hands are literally crying. Whiny ass hands.

Josh + Shelby :)

"event","Ahhhh...well a couple days later and a couple days wiser brings me to the happy conclusion that we are in fact together. Shelby and Josh, Josh and Shelby, Jelby and Shosh. I'm enjoying that. :) We really like each other, so things should work out. 

I talked to her yesterday and she's gotten sick again. But I don't think it's just another sickness, I think it's the same exact thing she's had for a couple months now. I want her to see a doctor, but she doesn't like the doc for some reason. I dunno. I feel like I'm being a retarded parent or something when I bug her to see a doctor. Hopefully she's feeling better today.

Umm, I spent most of today looking through my room and cleaning it, vacuuming it whatever. It looks really nice right now. :) AND I don't have to look for the receipt that I desperately needed to go to court with my jackass ex-friend Sai. 

The Eagles won too! They were pissing me off today, such lackluster play! Haha, but at least they beat Dallas. Right Shelby? :P

Hehe, this week will see me in Bakersfield. I think my dad's gonna forget my b-day again, shocker. The only person that seems to care is Shelby. Which makes me all warm and fuzzy in my chest-al section. My underpants too. I wish I could see her on my b-day. But that'll have to wait I suppose. 

I'm going to Fresno on the 26th to film a few races and some car footage with my buddy from the GS-R Forum. It should be pretty awesome. :) I'll be the fastest car there so I KNOW it'll be good. ;) 

ANYway...I am done here now. I've got work to do this week as well as some car maintenance that needs to be figured out."

"event","School's OUT. That means more slacking off than ever beforeeeeee! Haha. :) I have been so burnt out lately but that's ok. It's over now for the most part. The only thing I have to worry about now is money, or more specifically, my lack of money. Whatever, it'll work itself out.

So this weekend equals no Shelby. Why? I don't know. It's some sort of court thing. But what I don't understand is why I can't see her later that night. Court doesn't go till midnight. It stops at 5, just like everything else. So I'm just confused as usual. It's one of those things where I *think* we're together, but I'm not sure. I've never heard myself referred to as anything more than a friend. I think she's keeping me at arm's length for reasons I think I kinda know. The distance is too much or maybe I'm not especially interesting to her. Either of those I think would work. But then again...she sounded really awesome when I mentioned my birthday last year...hehe, I'm so clueless about relationships.

I'm heading off to a party tomorrow, it should be fun. Dylan's cousin's house is fuckin HUGE. There should be a good amount of people there (I'm hoping). I haven't gotten drunk in a while. I think I might just break that streak tomorrow. :P

I just talked with Shelby...but she logged off without saying goodbye. She's a tough nut to crack. It feels like I'm not really that important to her just yet. Which is weird. I don't really feel anything coming from her. Like either she's numb or I am. 

I work tomorrow, so that'll be good. I need to work as much as possible before I leave for Cali. 

Anyway, I will update sometime soon I think."

I saw Shelby this weekend, and for the little amount of time that I saw her, it was so nice! We saw The Incredibles, and even though I'd already seen it, it was still a great movie. That's the kinda shit that I want to be good at. 

I won't be able to see Shelby this weekend...or the weekend after that...or the weekend after that, etc. etc. etc. I dunno, it sucks that I can't see her. She said that this is the toughest time of year, and by golly, I think she's right. I'm looking forward to seeing her for a full day, hell, maybe more! I've got plans for her...hehehe;

1. get her to be more aggressive
2. want to keep her comfortable -- I think if I get her comfortable, I can release her inner vixen :)--
3. I want her to kiss ME ;) hehe

I'm curious to see how this stuff goes. I'm not going to press anything, but those are the things I'm personally working towards in our relationship. :) She's an awesome girl. *sigh* I just wish I could be with her again soon. But that won't happen for WEEKS. All I can say is, ""BOOOO!!!"" It sucks, but I want to give us a chance. This distance is hard, but I'll push through it. I've always said that distance will not stop me from getting closer to someone. I intend to follow through on that. 

School's been a fucking mess as far as tuition and shit goes. Me and my dad had a nice little argument and all the pressures that have been building up finally got let out. I cried like a wuss. Bah. I dunno. There's just so much stress I had to let it out at that pinnacle of frustration and anger. I just wish Mary was dead. Then I'd be the happiest of all.

This is the Monday of the last week of school. I have so much homework to do...and yet...I'm typing here. It seems that procrastination is my major. I should already have a phD though, so I don't know why I'd still be going to school for that. :)

I talked with Renee again today. I miss talking to her, I know we've been done for a while now, but I still want to hear what's going on. 

That's all I'm going to report tonight."

"event","So things aren't that cool right now. :P 

I had class today and it was regular boring. I skipped my 3d class because the teacher is a douche who sucks at teaching. I can do what I'm assigned now because I figured it out on my own. Typical. The guy never teaches anything useful. Ah well. I'll finish my boat and 'critter' soon enough.

What sucks is that I was informed that my teacher is the only MAYA teacher at the school. Which is incredibly awful. I'll have to get good on my own to even get a job. Yay! Now is where I really wish Mary wasn't such a money grubbing whore. 

But anyway, this weekend Shelby's going out of town so I won't have anything to do. Maybe I'll go to the drag races again or something. I guess it's good to get this break. Hehe, and I think I caught something from her when I kissed her last weekend. :P I feel on the verge of being sick and I've got some nasty congestion. It was worth catching. :)

Now tonight...I plan on getting to sleep earlier than usual and then heading off to work (fucking finally) at 8:30am. I'll get some positive money flow for a change!

I had a pretty amazing talk with Shelby last night. I learned some stuff I didn't know before. Some stuff makes me want to kick some ass. The reason being, Shelby is perhaps the nicest sweetest girl I've met. Yet people still find it ok to be a complete asshole to her. I don't get it. Heh, but if I ever catch anybody doing something like that to her while I'm around...there will be severe issues between myself and that person. 

I'm going to head off to UAT now, hopefully I can play some games before class. :) 

And I'm going to try to use this mood and music thing. It seems to be how people do things."

"event","I just got back a half an hour ago from seeing my baby doll Shelby for a day or so. She was really sick, but she still wanted to see me. :) I wanted to see her too. It seemed that she was feeling better as I was acting like a goofball, and it felt good to see her smile and hear her laugh. We watched tv in the hotel room and just talked about stuff. Even though we didn't do much in the way of a variety of stuff, it didn't matter, I was happy just to be around her. After we had our kick ass KFC food, we hopped into bed and just cuddled. 

And even though certain things didn't go 'perfectly' that night, I don't even worry. :) I know it'll work out eventually. She felt bad, but she shouldn't have. Even *I* have issues. Yes yes, I know it's hard to believe. ;) Hehe.

We woke up in the morning (me after a night of weird ass dreams) and she sounded so bad! I just wanted to hold her and kiss her, so I did. She sounded a little better around the time the annoying housecleaning lady ran us out at about 1pm. 

I hate leaving her after just 1 damn day every week. 

And now...I come home to an Eagles loss, homework, and no Shelby. Bah. 

I hope she gets better soon.

I was just thinking about my dreams. I dreamt that everyone was better at animating than I was. Which is true. Which just sucks. I don't know when I'll ever be good, good enough, whatever. It's all so fucking stressful. The stuff I need, I don't have. The confidence, it ain't here.

"event","This is the journal of Sharky0820, otherwise known as Josh. I've tried keeping shit like this before...and it never panned out. Perhaps this will be different. I actually have incentive this time to keep it going. I've got this girl who's so totally on my ass as far as this journal goes. ;) Hehe, just kidding, she's so amazing and I've actually been going up to see her every weekend since September 18th and I will continue to see her whenever I can (which is basically every weekend). The way I found her was on www.hotornot.com. I was scrolling through these people, just clicking ""NO"" to the phrase ""do you want to meet this person?"" like a madman UNTIL...until I found this gorgeous angel smiling at me from the glow of my computer screen. I immediately clicked yes and hoped for the best. I didn't hear back from her, nor did I expect to, and so life went on. I met one another girl from the same site, became a man in a way that I never wanted to. It was a one-night stand. That girl fell away from me, and though it happened not too long ago, she's a distant memory. And here I was, after having this thing happen to me, trying to find someone to actually be with. I'm not about one night stands or just fucking fooling around. I really enjoy the emotional connection that comes with someone whom you really like and eventually love. But anyway, back to how I met my beautiful girl. I was sorting through my email one day and hotornot had sent me an email saying someone wanted to meet me. I had had my share of mediocrity trying to meet me and I was just waiting for someone of quality, of substance, to write me. It was Shelby. I was immediately taken aback and smiled, knowing that I would finally be able to talk to this gorgeous girl who had written of asshole guys doing her wrong in her profile. I knew I was better than them, and I am. I'm so lucky to have this amazing girl with me. She makes me smile when she yawns for god's sake. The way she treats others around her is so wonderfully different than damn near everybody. Her sweetness is intoxicating and I love being around her smiles and her soft touch. When I wade through the shit I have to do during the week, my mind is on Saturday and Sunday. Those are the days that I get to see her. I cannot wait to see her again. Hmm, let's see, lemme just spout off about other stuff before I get off writing this book that is my first post.

Bush won the election. He fucking won. I have no idea if people weren't paying attention or what, but some voters were not doing their duty by OPENING THEIR GODDAMN EYES to see how big of a douche Bush is. He lies to the American public...and is rewarded. I'm actually scared of what this idiot will do. I cannot wait to see how he fucks up this term. Whatever. I don't even care anymore. Bah, and I just realized I'll have to look at the smirks of this one annoying woman at work who supported Bush because he was better looking that Kerry. See? See who supports Bush? Yeah. Although I'll bet there are quite a few retards who voted for Kerry too, but anyway.

My mother, and I use the term now only for reference as I do not call her that anymore, Mary is in the process of being contacted by UAT's financial aid lady. Why? Because of my school loans. You see, my dad had bad credit last year when he applied for this loan that I need, so I got it. This year, however, dad's credit was substantially improved because he was intentionally repairing it so he can finally get a house once more (Mary had the old one, and didn't make 2 payments, thereby ramming my dad's credit down the shitter) and because of that, I didn't get the loan, because there wasn't any financial stress I suppose. If Mary fails to get the loan, it will allow me to get the money I need without having to go anywhere or do anything. But I doubt that bitch will do anything. Her exact words were, ""He should fend for himself because I had to"" when they had both promised to pay for my college. Pfff, whatever whore, sorry for ruining your cheating parade with my college. Yeah, SORRRRRRRRY. Christ. Ok, I just vented, that felt good. :)

Uhm...actually, right now I'm just waiting for my baby doll Shelby to get back from watching Kill Bill Vol. 1 at the NAU dorms. Conan O'Brien is keeping me company and I've got a frosty cup of RC Cola next to me. I'm set for a while. :) I hope you had fun beautiful. I wish I coulda been there with you. ;)

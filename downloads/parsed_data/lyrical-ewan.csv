"event","The last month has truly been a blur for me.  I was so consumed by my depression that time passing was a secondary thought compared to the all-consuming flow of my despair.  My grades suffered for it and as a result I have an incomplete in 2 of my classes and have been placed on academic probation.  I have the summer term to make up the two classes and maintain a B average or better or I will be expelled.  I will not allow that to happen.  It's my own fault really, for allowing myself to be blinded by my own feelings, for not allowing myself to see what I knew from the beginning... he could never truly love me.  

Somehow, some way, I have managed to dig deep within myself and find the strength to pull myself back together again.  Though I know that I will never be the same.  I have been hurt too deeply for it to be any other way.  I have poured my heart and soul into my writing, the words streaming across the page the only thing that allowed me to maintain a tenuous grip on my sanity.  And so here I remain.  Perhaps a bit more cynical, not quite as naive as before, but me nonetheless.  That will have to be enough."

"event","my life is over 

nothing matters to me anymore

i've not left my room since it happened and i don't intend to either

i feel as though my heart has been ripped out of my chest and yet i still go on living even though i don't want to

i cannot even write

all i can manage are angry scribbles that fill page after page

i want to lay on my bed close my eyes and sleep and sleep and never wake up again

blissful oblivion"

"event","At no other point in my life has all been right with my world the way it is now.  I'm attending a wonderful school, meeting wonderful friends, finding time to write, and most importantly of all I've found Billy.  He is simply the most amazing person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  It still awes me that this vibrant, passionate, warm and sensual person wants to be with me.  He is my sunshine, my muse, my inspiration... more important to me than the very air that I breathe.  He is the first thing I think of in the morning, and the last thing I think of before falling asleep at night.  He is my world."

kiltmanboyd: *I saunter up to your door, my cutest yellow beret on, and knock chipperly*

LyricalEwan: *I put down my pen and look over at the door when I hear the knock.  I close my journal and go over to open the door, the Les MIserables soundtrack playing in the background.*

kiltmanboyd: *I chime in as Eponine starts to sing* I love him, I love him, I love him, but onleh on my owwwwwnnnnnn! Hullo dear *chipper*

LyricalEwan: *cannot help but smile*  Hello, Billeh.

kiltmanboyd: *I throw my arms around you, giving you a peck on the lips* What are ye doin?

LyricalEwan: *My eyes flick over to my closed journal*  Nothing, just a wee bit of writing.  *I look into your eyes and feel my heart melt.  Being with you has become so bittersweet.  Orlando is right, I should talk with you.*

kiltmanboyd: Ah've been worken on a wee writin, but et's nae finished yet *smiling, I hope he likes this song I'm writing* De ye want meh te go? Are ye buseh?

LyricalEwan: *I reach down to take your hand*  No, please stay.  *I give you a soft smile, trying to gather the courage to talk with you, but not wanting to upset you*

kiltmanboyd: *I squeeze your hand and smile up at you* Es everehthing okay, hon?

LyricalEwan: *I force my smile to get wider, I don't want to ruin your good mood*  Aye, Billeh, ah'm fine.

kiltmanboyd: Ah can tell yer nae fine, hon.  *I point up to your eyes, straining to smile* See, yer all wrinkleh from forcen.  What's wrong? *looking concerened*

LyricalEwan: *I sigh and let the small from my face, taking a seat on the bed*  Ah dunnae want te ruin yer good mood, Billeh.

kiltmanboyd: Yer daft! Tell meh! *I pull you over and sit you down on your bed* Please?

LyricalEwan: Do ye want te be with me, Billeh?  *I lace our fingers together and stare down at our joined hands*  

kiltmanboyd: What? How can ye even ask that? *where is this coming from?*

LyricalEwan: *I glance over at you*  Ah see the way ye look at Dom, Billeh.  Especialleh when he's with Elijah.  

kiltmanboyd: *I feel my throat getting a little tight* Ewan, I'd nae be with ye if I dinnae want te be with ye. 

LyricalEwan: *I sigh*  Ah worded that wrong, Billeh.  Ah know ye care about meh, ah do, but ah cannae help but feel like ye've settled for meh because yeh cannae have Dom.

kiltmanboyd: Et's nae like that Ewan.  Nothen is goin on with Dom.  I dunnae see why ye'd think there was.

LyricalEwan: *I shake my head, you obviously aren't willing to admit how you feel*  Forget et, Billeh.  

kiltmanboyd: *I look up at you sadly* No, Ewan.  What?

LyricalEwan: Ah told ye how ah'm feelin', ye obviousleh dunnae think et's an issue, so ah'll just have te get over et.

kiltmanboyd: No .... please.  How yer feelen es important te meh.  I just ..... I dunnae know what's goin on.

LyricalEwan: Ah told ye what ah thought was goin' on, apparentleh ah was wrong.

kiltmanboyd: Ah did ... meybeh ah do 'ave some feelins fer Dom, but et's nae affectin how ah feel about ye, or whether ah want te be with ye.  This is aboot ye en meh, nae Dom.

LyricalEwan: Does that mean that if Dom were free, and ye could be seein' either one of us, ye'd still choose meh?

kiltmanboyd: There's nae a doubt in me mind about that, Ewan *I take your face in my hands and press a kiss to your forehead*

LyricalEwan: Realleh?  *I want to believe you so badly, this has been eating away at me for days*  Ye realleh mean that?  *I look into your eyes, desperately searching for reassurance*

kiltmanboyd: *I look straight into your eyes* Ofcourse ah de, Ewan.  *I smile a little* I've ne'er met anehone as wonderful as ye.

LyricalEwan: *I feel relief surging through me and pull you to me for a passionate kiss, my hands pulling off your beret so my fingers can tangle themselves in your hair*

kiltmanboyd: *I let out a slight whimper, my hands sliding around your waist and pulling you closer, my head spinning slightly from the force of your kiss*

"event","Sometimes, when I stop and look around, I am overwhelmed by the beauty that surrounds me.  Just the simple things in life are so brilliant when you really stop to take the time to think about them.  The blades of grass, the warmth of the sun, the blue of the sky, the soothing breeze...all incredibly simple things and yet so utterly complex.  And all of them are reasons why this life is worth living.

Billy.  Billy has become a reason this life is worth living.  And like the blades of grass, he too is juxtaposition of that which is simple and that which is not.  I know he cares for me, that is easy for me to see, but the degree to which he does remains an elusive mystery that I've not yet been able to solve.  I also know that he is holding back from me.  That too is very easy to see.  But the reasons why, those are a tangled mess that I'm not even sure Billy has yet completely unravelled.  Part of it is his history, of which he has told me some, and another part is his roommate.  Dominic.  Billy hasn't told me much, but I can see something in his eyes whenever he sees Dom and Elijah together, and though I cannot put my finger on what it is, I know it is not happiness.  It is too bittersweet to be merely happiness.  

I just wish he would talk to me.  If Dom is who he wants, and Dom wants him in return, I would let Billy go.  It would probably kill me to do so, but I love him too much to keep him where he does not truly wish to be.

So simple, and yet so utterly complex."

"event","I think I've met my soulmate.  His name is Billy and he is simply the most amazing person I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in my entire life.  He's so full of life and energy, I feel more alive when I'm around him.  I cannot even believe how lucky I am to have found him.  We had this instant connection from the moment we met and I know, down to the depths of my soul, that we were meant to be together.  When we made love it was simply the most incredible experience of my life.  

I've always believed in love at first sight, but didn't think that it could ever happen to me..."

Men Suck! I just have to say it because it's really pissing me off. So
this guy, let's call him Dave because that's his name and I don't feel
like protecting his identity right now. Anyway, months ago... we're
talking back in July... we had one date. Then I was on a trip and he
was and we got back and I called him to see if he wanted to go out
again and he's dating someone else. Ok, right, no big deal really after
one date. So now.... after not speaking for the past two and a half
months he calls and invites me to this party he was having. In the
message he doesn't really say if he is now single, he doesn't say
anything about it being a date, just come, and bring anyone you'd like.
So I'm confused, what does this mean? I eventually called and told his
voice mail I had plans and couldn't go but thanks for inviting me. Most
advice has said to not find out if he wants to date again because he
better do something special if I was his second choice before. Problem
is I really liked him and I haven't had a date in months, so I'm a
little bummed out on the whole guy thing anyway. So now I need advice.

What do you do with the guy that you like but general consensus says
will be no good for you?

"event","My first week of school went really well.  The students are great, the schools are great, even this commuting thing is going fairly well.  We'll see about Wednesday when I have to make it from class at school A to class at school B in 20 minutes and it's a 15 minute drive, but I think it might actually work.  You'll all have to wish me luck on that one.  Kinda scary that I'm officially in charge of 150 young minds for an hour a day.  It's very exciting.  Imagine wanting something for twelve years and then suddenly getting it.  It makes me so happy I almost cried on my way to work this week.  I know I'm a total and complete sap, but really I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life right now.  Hopefully the happy high will last a few more months.  Mainly I wanted to share since in a few weeks I'm sure I'll be posting somewhat funny but tragic stories of what my students did to me that day.

In other news... I am getting a new car, the Honda Civic Hybrid, very excited about that.  Also I might be moving in with one of the other new teachers as prices for a one bedroom in my area are sky high and she happens to have an extra room and a desire to lower her rent price, that and it would cut my commute to school by at least 10 minutes.  That's most of it for now, I'll drop another post when the dust has settled from the start of school.  Leave me notes as there are many I haven't had a chance to call in quite some time.

"event","<blockquote>That's right people.  In ten days I will be a real teacher.</blockquote>
Isn't that scary?  Anyway, I'm totally excited.  I've been spending my time running away as much as possible, my friend Julie even started to notice.  I was in Kansas for about four days, moved on to Colorado for a few, flew back and turned around to Portland for curriculum training, then got back and had orientation for most of last week.  Now I have a few works days to get everything settled, a long weekend and the students arrive.  During that time I have to plan, set up my room, figure out the two schools and my schedules, and Gunter is coming to town.  Yay!  Ok, so I get to spend part of my last weekend dancing, I can't complain too much.  

In other news... I dyed my hair purple and then went and made it all school appropriate again today, so there is a new picture.  Sorry there is no picture of the purple, it just wasn't happening after the color faded a bit.  I'm off to plan and figure out what five nights I'm going to have the six dinners and baseball game I'm promised to go to..... oops.

They don't really count you down on that if it's something your students should know not to do, do they?  Anyway, I find out Monday if I'm in the second round of interviews.  I hope I am, but we'll see if my Rain Man impersonation tipped the scales for me.  That's my story, words of encouragement are welcome.

"event","First off... I went to Brazil.  Some of you know this, some don't.  It was a cruise with my family and I had great fun.  There is so much to tell about it but at the same time it is completely inexplainable.  We spent some days on the beach in Tortolla and Trinidad.  We saw the rain forest in Dominiqa.  Got a taste of local life in Santarem and Boca De Valaria, and then ended with the cultural center of Manaus.  If you want to hear more I will tell stories, but mainly I recommend that you all go there some day.  It's a different life style than I've ever seen and really a different world as well.  I want to go back and explore more, though the heat and humidity was not meant for us northerners.  

In addition to that I've just been working on finding my footing here in Seattle.  I work at Ann Taylor, Seattle Public Schools as a sub, and as a nanny for some friends of my sisters.  It's all going fairly well and I'm getting applications in for permanent teaching next year, so we'll see what happens.  Next step is to start getting out more without spending money... any ideas?  I'm taking a ballet class, but not the easiest way to make new friends.  I'm not worried about it though, I'm sure it will all happen in it's own good time.  For now I'm off to bed, have to be up early to sub and all.  Night."

Now on to more introspective types of things.  I love dancing.  I haven't danced now in months, but I adore it.  I think one of the first things I'm going to do with my paycheck is sign up for a class of some sort.  I need to dance at least once a week.  I don't care what style anymore.  Swing, Latin, Ballroom, Ballet, anything would work.  Just to have that again seems like the most important thing.  I'm not really sure where all this is coming from.  Dancing wasn't so important before.  I loved it, but it was just another thing.  Going to that Latin club though hit some spark.  I looked like a fool I'm sure, I do not have the hips down.  It was just so fun, and no one cares if you're just learning.  They don't care if you're married or single or gay.  All that matters is if you're willing to learn.  It's so free, and anyone can dance.  It really doesn't matter, there is some style of dance that they would do just fine at.  My problem is that I can't seem to pick one.  I like them all.  Well I guess that's it.  That's my random rambling.  If anyone wants to come visit me and go dancing I would love it.  Until then I'll be searching for partners and people to go with.... and dancing in my kitchen while I cook, because I just can't help it.  Maybe I'll get lucky and get to dance again soon."

So far I've set up the apartment, taken lots of walks, gone to the city, and hung out with my sister and brother-in-law a few times.  They are great, just ... much older and at a different part of life.  I do love the apartment though, which you can even look at my view and a few of the pictures I've taken of the city at http://home.comcast.net/~zandera82ole/Main.html.  I think it will be great once I meet some people.  Speaking of I have a few life lessons for the day.

1)  When you take the bus somewhere make sure you know which bus to take home again.
2)  If you are silly and didn't check the bus home, find a cute guy at a coffee shop and get directions.
3)  Stop being a chicken and ask the cute guy for his number rather than walking out after getting your coffee.

There you have it.  Pearls of great wisdom.  I'll write more when I'm not so down about the whole people thing.

"event","Alright... I know I'm a sap, but I was watching Gilmore Girls tonight and Rorie had her first kiss.  It made me really sad because I can't remember mine.  I remember my first french kiss, and coincidentally they were with the same guy.  I just don't remember the first kiss.  I think it was probably at school in the hall, and I know it was very nice, but I wish I remembered more of it.  Sometimes I wish that I could take it all back and have my first kiss over again.  Now that I know how special it was I would remember better, I swear. 

I do remember talking about it with my best friend and her telling me that Patrick (my boyfriend) wanted to kiss me but I wouldn't look up at him when the time was right.  I was dodging because I was so scared of that first kiss.  Then at some point when we were alone I turned my face up to his (he was quite tall, I've always had a thing for tall guys) and he kissed me.  

In this light... I invite you all to relive that special first kiss, cause well, even though it makes me melancholy it also makes me smile."

I practiced clarinet for the first time in.... seven months.  (Yes that was me counting on my fingers)  It makes me happy.  Clarinet and teaching are very similar things to me.  I don't miss them but once I go back to them I realize how much a piece of my life was missing while they were gone.  .... I hope I feel that way about a guy some day... ok, and I hope I miss him in the in-between times.  I just had to share.  Yesterday I was all upset because my parents were pressuring me to move to Seattle, and today I have peace again through music.  Hmm... maybe the sleep deprivation is helping too.  I'm trying to get on a normal schedule so that I can drive to MN on Thursday.  Oh well, either way.. I'm happy.

Alright, I caved, it's kinda cool, and maybe even fiting.  

Christmas is going well for me, I'm still waiting for Jon to call, not really sure he will, or what I'll do if he doesn't.  Hope the holidays are treating you all well also.

Love ya,

"event","Today in the interest of getting off the island, (For those of you that don't know I'm living on Bainbridge Island near Seattle) I went for lunch in the city.  Seattle is really cool.  Sure there are more bums than most people would like, but that doesn't really bother me much, they are pretty happy bums.  One had a sign that just said smile, and then he said have a good weekend when I did.  If I had any change in my pocket at that moment it would have gone to him.  I might make it a tradition from now on to carry a dollar or two with me for the most friendly homeless person I see.  

Anyway, on with the story.  On the ferry I met up with my neighbor and his baby girl.  So I got to spend the ride cooing with her and talking to him.  She's very cute, and I even got to hold her for a bit.  Once in Seattle I walked with them until we went separate directions and then just kinda walked around the major fun areas.  Pike Place Market was the first stop.  It's full of interesting lunch stands, flower stands (which currently have dried flowers but in warmer times have fresh), produce/fish stands, cute hippie shops, and other misc. places.  After a good random stroll I grabbed a chicken kebab (sp?) and started toward Pioneer Square.  

Pioneer Square is really a few blocks in a type of square shape.  One of the best book stores in town happens to rest on one corner, and one of the best coffee shops in town on another.  We can all guess what I was doing there.  I think that this area of the city is one of the nicest, even though most of the benches are occupied by people wrapped in sleeping bags.  There are wide open pedestrian zones with trees and sculptures, and cool old buildings line all the walks.  I still have a lot of Seattle to explore, but I think I'll always like this area, especially the Eliot Bay Book Company.  

After my successful exploration I went back and got on the ferry back to the island.  Now this is by far my favorite part of my new life.  Watching the sky line of the city from the water as I leave is about the best thing ever.  It's really amazing at night.  Someday you must all visit me and I will take you to my sisters on the island just for this view.  Unless I live on the island myself, then you'll have to see it anyway.  I have to say I like the island, I've gotten very used to the quiet life of the house, where most of the noises come from the lot kiddy-corner where they are building something.  My occasional strolls to the beach, where it is very cold, but peaceful and serene, and the slow exploration of the island are a very charming way to live life.  I don't think I'll move here right away, it's not a great place for a single 20 something, but some day I might like to move away from the city.  Alright since my second post has now gotten very long I will move to the point.

Today reminded me of my travels.  Just taking off and seeing something new, or in this case something I've never explored on my own.  I miss it, and am not more convinced than I was yesterday that I need to go to Australia and New Zealand.  After New Years I hope to be off again, I'm just waiting for the right ticket price.  I want to get out and do some more exploring and experience new things again.  I swear I'll settle down soon.  Ok, maybe I'm lying, but I actually really want to have a home again.  In my mind it will be in Seattle so that I can visit my sister for dinners once a week, and have more time to explore this cool city.  We will see what happens in the end.  I guess that'll be the end for now.  I'll write more adventures another day."

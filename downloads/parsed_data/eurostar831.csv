JUst different people.   in each of these groups, the membersd can also represent members in the other greoups as well..    i dont know sometimes we just have to grow up i guess, and turn the page, even if it means having to say goodbye to peoepl you like being around."

Obviously not her I guess. Or so it seems now anyways.  Selfish people are hard for me to deal with. Like i would totally give all my posessions up for someone if it was importnant no questions asked. WHy can't others be like that?
        Tangent, I would just like to say  i love music  alot. ANd song memories i htink are prob. the best ever. LIke when a song comes on  and like everyone thinks it's stupid cuz it's old, but you have like the best memory ever with it, thats hwat i mean.   What made me think of this is andrea  was listening to basement jaxx ""you used to be my romeo"" and she said that song totally reminded her of me.   ANd like that made me remember the party ""alice deejay"" in like may of 2000.   one of the best parties vere and iw as totally overdosing  siting in the back of the main room, and they started their first song, and like everyone just went wild, and all of the sudden i was all better and having the itme of my life.  and then theres like the songs that remind you of your frineds and special moments with them.. those are alot of fun to think about:-)
         ok so i have decided I want lots of acid in my system right now. It has been entirely waaaaaaay to long since i  have fryed my ass off.  So, i think ill go by some. Oh wait iI just rememebred i live in AZ meth heaven but acid hell , once ina greta  while does one actually find really good acid here.  Kind of disappointing.
         I am glad someone was smart enough to invent he dew rag, cuz when you dont feel like doin gyuor hair, they come in hella handy!
          And so im prob. not gona see michelle at all this weekend and im not happy with that at all. IM hoping she might mak a miraculous healing and like feel all better and be able to hang out.
         So hows about my not havoing sex for 9 months.  ITs like im on a sober binge,  just with sex instead of sobriety.  Whats up with that?  I wish i knew.  I have l ot more topics to ramble about so im gona postt his, then compile my thoughts."

SO now im happy cuz i know it will be a lot more fun.    ANd i was also very flattered because one of the boys there liked me.   The muse is a coffee shop by the way  where they have dj's spin on wednesday nights.   
    Umm sarah  gets here tomorrow from chicago  and ia sked her what she was planning on doing while dj was at school, and she slike ""hanging out with this guy name MyKuhl""  and i wa slike oh wow that sme, umm ok!   So now I guess  i have to have to no matter what try my best to hang out with her, which isn't a problem at all cuz i think she's cool, it's just a lot of stress, because she hangs around with people who  sometimes im not cool with.  i dont know  awkward story.....  ummmmm so i have more to write but my friend is here now  so i iwll continue my ramblings when I get home which will prob. be in 2 or 3 hours!

"event","OK so finding a job isn't that hard in all 50 states including puerto rico, but yet it is for me. Why? Must be that whole motivation  nonsense i guess.
      This  is the designated area in which we all clap our hands for moms thats are beasts. -----> (designated area)    ok for reals  I just had to add that because my mom is an all around beast.  It's to the point where she plays the part sao good i wana give her a trophy for it. But enough of mom stories.
      I was very suproised today that my not so best friends anymore, but still really good friends, called me today to go to the state fair with them! I didn't go, but it made me very happy to know that they were thinking of me. Thats always nice to know.
      From the looks of it, it seems as if Indiana people are hte most scandelous people I have ever met in my whole entire life. So I guess that would mean I have no competition here in AZ. I know that sounds really bad, but it seems as if everyone in AZ tries to be noce for some reaosn, even if they don't like you. Kind of makes you wonder.   Oh wait I forgot i live in the land of mormons.  That could play a big part in everyones random niceness.
      Hehehehe this week, since I have been sober I have gained 14 pounds.That would scare most people, but not I cuz I know within a week I lose those 14 poounds, and prob. 5 more  thanks to this Fridays events... ::crosses fingers::
 I  think once again I have reached the legal limit for writing, so im outtie 511

"event","but i don't care theres no other way to type about the situations.   
    First off: There is this boy online who feels the need to im me everytime I sign on, and well I made the mistake of giving him my phone number like a month ago, and calls all day long, and constantly asks me when he can meet me. I dont wana meet him cuz he seems well ""not up to the social par"" but im too nice of a person to say ""later bitch stop calling""  you think after a  month though he would get the picture..  but nooo AZ loves it's idiots I guess.
    Dos problemos:  I have a gya friend and an acquaintence, and they were all abou tnot liking eac other when i lived in chicagol. Then I moved and the next day they porked....   and im not jelaous  i wasn't attracted to eithe rof them, but I was  I don't know madd for some reaosn  cuz I felt like they had to do it behind my back. Ok not that big of a deal anymore im over it, but one of mthe boys, the acquaintence, has a rash on his penis now and on the inside of his mouth, and i know i should't laugh but i do find ot humerous  cuz I always knew that was gona happen to him...
     Number 3: another gay boy story....   I have a frined named joel   who  like we have been firneds for awhile now. Then i moved form az to chicago and like we parted   and left on bad terms, but we still chatted and we grew like an online relationship.  WHen i decided to move back I knew he was gonna wanna hook up.  I have always like him, just not enough for a committment, but  I thought well maybe we will hook up and i'll setle for him. But hwen i moved back here i found that all of AZ had become *KuTe* while i was gone. Then i realized oh wait thats called a sex drive, and like so i showe dup at his un apartmento with another boy, and he took it as if I liked him, and i really didn't   but i thin khe got all buitt hurt./ So he randomly stopped talking to me. and that would be ok  cuz we have our problems all the time,. but it's not ok thats he's telling people things that he really shouldn't. And he was such a good frined beofre that I don't know what to do about it.   Like  he's telling people how i used to do heroin, but he's telling them that im an addict and i haven't done it in like 6 months. SO like i lead an open life and don't care peoepl know i did it, but iI dont   want them to have a falsified opinion of me.
   Cuatro:  seeing as we are laready tlaking baout drugsm ight as well  blurt out that my frined form chicago is comming this weeknd and he wants top purchase 4 ounces of shards... And I am sooo excited cuz if htis works out thats like a 5-700 dollar profit in my pocket, and that makes me happy.  But he was here 2 weeks ago to see another friend and he never got around to buying, so I hope that doesn't happen this time.
    Number 5:  I mis my best friends alot.  I moved back to AZ and was so excited to see my old frineds, but then I realized living in a big coty environment  I grew up a lot an dlike alot of different htigns now, and they are all about staying the same they used ot be. ANd thats not very fun....   And like I barely hang out with them anymore. I mainly hang out with only 1 person here, and thats cuz we are togethe rlike all the time. Then we just randomly visit everyone esle, but don't really hang out with them. But thats ok  because I have a lot more fun with her then I would in a group of peopel anyways, and we are both *SuPeR KuTe* which makes things even better.  
    jesus h christ  im done typing  it should be illegal to type that much in one sitting.   so im done.   and if anyone reads this  can you please tell me if kmy pic shows up  when i post?  thanks
Have a nice day!

I.e. being sober for a whole week!  Proud of that...   Then theres mucho fun car wrecks i can ramble about..... Who would of ever thought that a random dresser in the middle of the freway  could end someones life?   Death by dresser? NOt a way to go, good thing we are all troopers!   I got the scars to prove it now.... But plop plop plop  My stubborn ass wouldn't go to the doctors which I should of. I'm  sure I could of got some vicaden out of it. I think it's mainly cuz I didn't wanna go through any more hassle then I already have.  So hows about ""almost relationships""  those are  almost reassuring...  and hows about all those  friends i had in chicago and then moving back to AZ and having like 3 or 4 at most.  I miss Chicago soo much the best parties, and the most profit from selling drugs. For reals   10-12 bags of k per vile  as opposed to az's like 5-6... plop plop plop on that....   
      How does one not be a flakey friend?  That is the question.  hows about if i stop with all the tangents, compile my thoughts, and type later??  Good plan

"event","So, life took a new turn recently. Back in November I left AT&T due to their 'three year rule' which basically says you can only be at AT&T as a contractor for three years and if you have not taken a permanent position by then you have to leave the company for three months. My time ran out and I took the first position that came through, a contract with Mastercard through the same company who had me at AT&T. 

Mastercard put me on an interesting shift, I worked from 3 pm to 11:30 pm on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. That came to an end last Friday (5/19) when I put in two weeks notice. AT&T had some open positions and had made me an offer on one of them and I had accepted with a tentative start date of June 5th. Mastercard allowed me to work through to the end of my shift, but I was called the next morning and informed not to come back in. Fortunately I was in a good position and when I told AT&T that I was available sooner than expected they were able to move my start date forward a week.

So now I start working back at AT&T on May 30th, just a little over six months since I left. My new schedule will be Monday through Friday days with a six week rotation on the weekend maintenance window. I'm really looking forward to this opportunity as the position sounds like a very interesting new challenge. I'm feeling very fortunate that things were able to work out so well."

"event","Well, I've made it past three months at Mastercard and decided it is time to move on. Well, to be honest, I decided that around the month and a half mark but the interview process has been a bear. Sadly, between my schedule there and my commute times I find I am almost never available for the 'hanging out' things I used to enjoy doing. So I've been doing the interview thing. One company had a three step process, first with the department head, then a quasi-technical interview, and finally a face to face. I have gotten to step three and will be flying up there next week to meet with them. Another company had a job that I withdrew from and then came back to discuss an alternate position. I interviewed for that almost three weeks ago and haven't heard anything since. It is to the point where even the contracting company putting me up for the position is now pessimistic about it. Though they are telling me that the company in question is dragging their feet on a lot of positions and not just mine.

At any rate I am hoping that one of these positions will come through soon and allow me a more functional schedule. No guarantees, but it's a hope. Aside from that I've been watching anime, reading comics, playing MMOGs, and recently started up an anime-feel RP story for my SO. It's going along alright, and is a definite fun thing to do while passing the time. Oh, yeah, I've also been on a diet and exercise program and managed to drop twenty pounds since January 1st. Go me. ;)"

Well in this instance one person, and a posting a friend sent me that I will be answering this weekend.

"event","I'm here, awake, alive, and running on not quite business as usual. Yeah, the update is a day late, but scheduling demanded it.

Since I pulled a shift on Sunday the 11th for a co-worker I was rewarded with Saturday the 17th off. The extra day came in handy as Liz and I traveled to Kansas City to grab one more game session this month. This was pretty fortunate since we're probably going to be on hiatus until roughly December if not longer. The GM's wife's job has decided to pack her fourth quarter with lots of traveling and combined with your usual real life obligations that doesn't leave many (any) weekends for gaming. I'm not complaining, though, I need to use the time to straighten out my own job situation. Nov 17th is my last day at AT&T, and since that's less than two months away it is time for me to put some serious effort towards finding a new job.

So the gaming this weekend was fairly intense. All of the characters wound up going through the emotional wringer for different reasons. My character was left holding the bag on a war his father had planned and had the unexpected joy of being attacked by his own mother while trying to win the battle. Between her interference, several key resources going AWOL, and some unexpected allies on the side of the enemy he was forced to retreat. This next part gets kind of hard to explain...

A little while ago in game my character went through a series of rituals that culminated in his becoming Lord Storm. This has its good points and bad points. The good points include that the title comes with its own kingdom, some interesting items of power, and the ability to control storms. The downside is that his power is consciously controlled and affected by his moods. When he gets really angry people know it. The sky darkens, funnel clouds form, wind and lightning begin to blast the land. It can get pretty apocalyptic. It also works both ways. His resonance with 'storm' makes him more tempestuous.

This bit of exposition was necessary to explain what happened. His mother magically used storms to attack his homeland. The side effect of this was that it kept cranking up the power level of ambient storm which impacted my character's ability to think clearly and focus. By the time he was forced to call the retreat in the battle the power was ratcheted up so high he was feeling physical pain. It had also keyed into his anger, so he was pretty much at a full boil which meant that his Storm energies off the scale. So much so that he was able to use that energy to travel halfway across the universe by 'stepping from storm to storm'. 

Every land he appeared in en route was immediately ravaged and by the time he reached her he was mad enough to kill... Just in case he wasn't, she immediately laid out a no win ultimatum. If he did not stop her she would destroy his homeland but the only way to stop her was to kill her. He did. As she fell to the ground his instinct moved him to catch her which brought him close enough to hear her final thoughts. First she said 'thank you' and then she cursed his father with her dying breath.

It turned out that she had intentionally manipulated him into killing her. She was tired of living and wanted only the peace of death. She got it at the low price of another piece of her son's soul.

Needless to say it was a pretty intense session. Each character had climactic final encounter which, together, the GM summed up with 'and so ends book one'. 

Then I got back into Saint Louis and started off my first day and hours at work by running training sessions for people. It's a great way to begin a work week. Especially when you've had no time to practice your presentation and when you couldn't sleep the night before. So last night wound up being eat early, go for a walk, spend some time with the girlfriend, and get to bed early.

For those who are aware of the rarely updated website I put up for the game, the weekend did cause me to further adjust one of the sarcastic signature quotes of the campaign. What began as 'A dead hero is easier to love' segued into 'A dead mother was easier to love'. After this weekend I admit I was wrong. A dead mother isn't easier to love."

"event","So this weekend was a short one. I invested my Sunday 'today' for my Saturday 'tomorrow'. Aka I took someone's Sunday shift on the 11th so I could get free of work for Saturday the 17th. While this caused me to miss the opening weekend of football it has allowed me to schedule another game session. So I will once again be down in KC this weekend for the further suffering of Prince Garrick.

And while I did not get to watch the game I got to listen to it on the radio and track it online. So I was gleefully aware of my team dishing out six kinds of whup-ass on the Jets. And equally pleased to hear that the Donkeys were treated to a humiliating beatdown by the Dolphins. So I can honestly say my weekend started off on a good note. (Especially since New Orleans managed to pull it out and beat Carolina.) It wound up being less than productive for the most part, though.

I avoided online for almost the entire weekend. I took some time to read, though mostly online news articles. I poked, prodded, and hammered at illuminating my character's mindset after his traumatic last session. I watched a bit of TV, a decent portion of football, and had the joy of visiting my dentist on Monday for a 'cleaning'. I so thoroughly hate having those damned torture implements scraping against my teeth, but not much choice on that one. And apparently I picked up a few cavities so now have to go in and get them filled. :P

There was also a brief bit of time devoted to thumbing through the newest Vampire edition. I am really rather 'enh' about the whole thing. Though I discovered that my hatred of the whole 'humanity' system remains alive and virulent. It was fed most strongly by reading that the new 'sin example' for someone with Humanity 10 is 'hurting someone's feelings'. I really haven't put my finger on quite which Judeo-Christian philosophy defines this game, but I am pretty tired of it. 'Right and Wrong' are in large part defined by the culture you are raised in (or live in) and so it drives me batty how ... unyieldingly 'my way or the highway' the humanity system is designed to be.

Now that my rant is done... I can't say much else about the weekend. We managed to get some laundry and the grocery shopping done. And Liz indulged me in eating out at someplace that has a rather limited menu for her. (Brought on by when she commented when I made hungry longing sounds at a Chili's commercial.)

All in all a rather mundane weekend. But there are worse things to have I suppose."

"event","While I had known that I would have four days for my holiday weekend, I had no way to realize I would get an early start on it. But when a water main broke I was discharged from work a little over two hours early. I could have made good, fruitful use of the time. Instead I decided to relax before Saturday's long drive partly in order to avoid the weekend traffic rush.

Even with leaving Saturday instead of Friday I wound up spotting three separate speed traps on the highway. The drive was pretty decent, though as traffic was pretty light for a weekend let alone a holiday one. Thanks to having Saturday off we were able to leave earlier (and I was not driving after working for ten hours) and so got into town around seven thirty instead of closer to eleven. This meant that after our usual flurry of random conversation we wound up having a bit of gaming that night. Including a slight adjustment to the scene that brought last session to a close.

My character survived the weekend physically intact despite the inclusion of various conflicts, a near mutiny, and a family dinner gone awry. For his efforts he picked up several compliments and a suitcase full of mental/emotional scarring. Oh, and his girlfriend got thrown in the dungeons. But other than that he did well.

A long drive back preceded an evening of playing with music on my computer and then today when I wind up back at work. A bit bleary but decently stress-relieved.

(Yes, that's a pretty thin summation for three days of RP. If anyone wants more detail they can feel free to ask.)"

"event","Another weekend's useless energy spent.

This weekend I almost completely avoided my computer and instead used the time to read a book, take in a movie, and hit the bookstore. 

The book I read was called 'Last Call'. My friend Allan had shipped it to me with a little note that I should read it. I started in only to be poked at by my girlfriend. Seems she talked me into buying it a couple of months back and I never picked it up. So now that I had two copies I started to read.

It was a fun book. A fictional story woven around gambling, Tarot cards, and a combination of various mythologies/mythic figures. It was an engaging read most of the way through though I found the ending to be a bit of a disappointment. Still, I'm fond of books that combine a gambler's instinct with mysticism (Blood by Michael Moorcock) so it was interesting.

Took the SO out to see 'Sky High' the Disney High School with Superpowers flick. It was... well, cheesy in a lot of ways but still fun. Discussion afterward focused around the fact that 'Warren Peace' was the most interesting character in the movie. Though it did include a brief aside regarding coolness of powers 'Technopath' won that list.

Follwing the movie, we went out for Italian, hit Borders to get a Full Metal Alchemist tee-shirt for the SO and some books for me/both of us; a few Aspirin myth books, Submission: A Novel, and Lord of Snow and Shadows.

Then a good night's sleep with weird dreams about vampires which might have been caused by the CSI episode I watched. *shrugs*

And now back to the grind. More work and job-hunting for me."

"event","Well it's another fun Saturday at work which, lately, means there is absolutely nothing going on before 1pm and then a whole mess worth of stuff between 1pm and 5pm when I leave. Thankfully it's my 'friday' so when I leave I get to bail this place until Wednesday rolls back around.

Not much of note for this week. I had expected my recent binge of MMO playing (City of Heroes of late) would come to an end when Madden 2006 came out. And while it has come to an end I'm not playing Madden. Unusually I just don't have much interest in the game this year though that might be part of my 'football hangover'. Between following my own team last year, keeping track of everything for fantasy football, and just generally following the game I'd say football was my major hobby last season. Though about two-thirds of the way through the season it struck me that spending all Sunday every Sunday watching TV was a waste of time. Since then I haven't really given things the attention I used to. 'course I'll still try to watch and keep up with my team. (Go Chiefs!)

I've been finding that my once-beloved computer looks like a torture device when I'm at home in the evenings. This keeps me from doing much online. Thankfully I have a newfound addiction to fantasy (CSI) and real shows about forensic science (yay Discovery channel/Court TV) which is taking up my evenings.

Of other non-breaking news is the job front. AT&T, where I've been for almost three years, has a policy about contractors; hired in three years or out. With all the market foo and the SBC merger they aren't hiring anyone. So I'm out in November. (November 17th to be exact.) This has me cruising the job boards and realizing that most of the jobs are in California. In some ways that's a good thing, I did like California and especially Monterrey, but then again my buddy Allan just moved to Witchita. Now while that's 7 hours or so from where I am, Kansas City is right in the middle. So we can actually manage to run into each other from time to time now. That and I want to spend a bit more time around my grandmother, so I'm more looking for jobs in the Missouri/Kansas area.

Tonight's docket of activities will mainly revolve around Cartoon Network. Teen Titans, Justice League, Inuyasha, One Piece, and S-cry-ed. In between shows I'll be snag some time doing things around the apartment and devising new tortures for my RL game character. I am having fun doing savage things to his psyche. In the past I wasn't as good about making my characters truly suffer and felt that to be a weakness in my writing, but with Garrick I'm actually having fun with it. Might have to actually pick up one of my old stories and see which way it goes now.

Anyway, that's about it for today.

"event","Huh. I'm more than a year older since my last update. I really should pay more attention to this thing. Since it has been a year I suspect anyone still keeping an eye on this will guess that a lot has happened. So let me see if I can sum up.

The Amber game I started playing in a month or two before the last update is actually still going. I am astounded. There are many fun quotes which I won't put up right now. And one scary comment. You know you're in a lot of trouble when your GM is talking about how he feels sorry for your character.

My roommate/girlfriend and I are still doing well. This fascinates me. I can't even stand myself as well as she puts up with my idiosyncracies. Of course given that we spent half an hour before I left for work this morning discussing mythology and the way it was altered was fun. The last detail had to do with how Pre-Iliad Diomedes was killed at the Trojan war by Achilles over the body of Pentheselia...

I have a new car. I like my new car. I miss my old car. But I always have been one to suffer from Nostalgia. New car: Bigger. Faster. More powerful engine. Old car: Got me reliably where I wanted to go.

In November I will have worked for AT&T for three years. Also in November my employment with AT&T will come to an end. Seems that due to the SBC thing they won't be offering any of us contractors jobs. And AT&T rules say that you can only be a contractor for three years without getting hired. It's a very clean circle.

No idea where I'll be living next. My best friend is moving back to the Kansas (though he's going to Wichita (yuck)) and I am pondering trying to stay close to my grandmother for a while.

In December of 2004 my mother died in a house fire.

Despite the fact that I knew I was finally going to post that fact in my live journal, looking at it after I typed it stills my thoughts.

See, my relationship with my mother was not what anyone would call amicable. I have at times felt that I hated my mother, despised my mother, never wanted to see my mother again, and was absolutely apathetic about my mother. My mother was an alcoholic. My mother used drugs. My mother was /always/ a little girl who never grew up in some ways. But despite all of the negative things I can say about her she was still my mother and a part of me always loved her.

And that part of me always thought that there would be more time to eventually straighten everything out. To forgive. To come to some understanding. It is so incredibly cliched but no less true. I thought there would be more time. And then suddenly I found out that all of that time was gone. It was too late.

So I took several months of time to get a handle on my feelings for the situation before talking to anyone outside of a select few. And I thank my girlfriend for being a very positive influence during that time. (And a very tolerant one.)

There is a massive thunderstorm just passed in the last hour and sounding like it might come back for seconds, my roommate is playing Lineage 2, I had chicken, spinach, rice, and feta for dinner, and will be putting in a full day of overtime this week thanks to a training session, but strangely enough I'm feeling pretty good. Thankfully, it will pass.

Lots of creative urges lately, I might even indulge a few. Lots of emails behind in the answering due to general busy-ness and a lack of ability to sit still at a computer for long.

Oh, and I turned 33. Yeah me!

More soon... Maybe."

"event","Well, it's only been about halfway to forever since I last updated this page. So, hmm. What to say. 

A great deal has gone on. Much of it having to do with finally getting my finances relatively straightened out and coming perilously close to accepting a writing project. 

Oh, and by accident of life I wound up with a roommate. A friend who had been visiting got turned back at the Canadian border (she had been staying in Canada) and was forced to return to the airport she had departed from. So she's staying with me at the moment. The good news is she can cook, thankfully, which means I indulge less in going to Wendy's and more eating in the apartment.

The bad news is that my apartment is too small for two bodies to fill for long periods of time. Eh. It will work itself out.

I've taken to actually reading the news again lately. At first it was just a break to distract me while I was waiting on football updates. Now I actually follow it. Which, sadly, gives me reason to be disturbed at the way things are going.

On the plus side it has given me an idea. A Political themed show a la Hardball or Crossfire that is staffed with muppets. I think I'd like to watch puppets yammering on about things they flipflop on rather than grown men who seem to think they're on the playground in grade school.

And I went down to visit my grandmother this past weekend. It had been a while since I went to see her, but I was bringing gifts which balanced. In honor of the DVD player I got her for Xmas a year ago, I got her some more DVDs this year in hopes of getting her to use it. In this case the entire Cadfael series. Of course this is my grandmother who is still mainly using cassette tapes for music, but I have to start somewhere."

"event","The quick run through, lets see. Yesterday was a melancholy mood that was 'repaired' by shopping and a long haul endurance test (2 hours of EQ). The shopping still has me rather gleeful, though. First I hit the game store where I found little of interest to buy but did pick up 6 issues worth of both Dungeon and Dragon magazines as well as a few comics. Those were not the best part, though, as I later went out to Best Buy (you have /NO/ idea how much I miss Fry's) and went on a CD/DVD shopping spree.

I picked up the Sports Night collection, the Mummy collection, Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, and an anime collection called 'Crest of the Stars'. In addition, I got a Nickelback album and the digitally remastered Queensryche: Empire album which added on some b-sides including the cover of Scarborough Fair. All of these things I like or love (with the exception of Crest of the Stars, no idea on that one), and was happy to acquire. Happy enough that while doing chores around the house today I watched 9 or 10 episodes of Sports Night. I really love that show, it never fails to make me laugh. And it did for much of the many hours I watched it.

Aside from that, today was a lazy pre-work day. I went to the grocery store and got a lot of fruit, did the dishes, and started in on the laundry. I really needs some new hobbies as my grandmother suggested. I should start by looking into a gym membership."

Okay, I talked to my grandmother tonight, her response? You're bored. Get off your ass and do something. Get out. Go out and meet people. Get a social hobby. There's nothing wrong with you, you're just bored and not doing enough.

And this doesn't do the conversation justice. My grandmother definitely believes that a point is best emphasized by rote repetition, which she did every few minutes while we talked on the phone.

"event","So the last few days have brought an interesting realization; I'm angry. The funny thing is that I have no idea what is causing me to be angry. I just know that I'm angry, all the time angry at some level, and that it is leaving me touchy about little things in a way that I don't like. 

As with everything I am thinking about, a song lyric or quote always springs to mind. Right now I'm thinking of an old Huey Lewis and the News song. A part of the refrain was 'Walking on a thin line, Angry all the time, Take a look at my face, see what it's doing to me'.

And while I would love to come up with a clean, neat, simple explanation for it, I find I don't have one. I don't even know that I will figure it out. It is like I took a wrong turn somewhere and now I'm trapped in this mood. And everything I do is colored by it."

"event","I once read the biography of Vida Blue, back when I was a big baseball fan as a kid. It noted that the owner of one of the teams Vida played on wanted Vida to change his name to 'Blue Moon Odom' and Vida refused. I guess advertising and showmanship were just as ridiculous back then.

So, let's see what I can put together in the way of an update. I've been in St. Louis for heading onto 9 months now, long enough to have given birth. Frankly, I did not think I would make it this long. And when I look back, I am somewhat amazed to discover I have survived to this point. I never thought that coming back to the midwest would be tough. But it can be a daily struggle to deal with the mass of conservative republican types. Me, a rather moderate liberal who feels George Bush is about as smart as old shoe-leather is stuck working with people who see traits to idolize in the man. And add to that a couple of outspoken creationists and I'm just astounded by the environment change. To say the least, it is incredibly different from any place I worked in California. But I survive, some days less gracefully than others.

Now, on a totally different note, I am discovering that when I have all of my things in a one bedroom apartment, there isn't room for them and me to co-exist peacefully. I feel like I'm living in my great-grandmother's house where every spare inch of space was storing a box of something. I'm starting to consider a new living arrangement, but so far I've stood pat. As I might be having a friend show up next month to couchsurf for a bit, I'll postpone my decision for the moment.

Now, in case this all seems too dreary, there have been a few bright moments in my life. A surprise I set up long ago finally played itself out. I didn't get to see it, but it paid me off in a smile and peace of mind. An old friend recently got back in touch with me, and it's been nice catching up on old times. And, even better, my writing inspirations are creeping back into my head. So I've got several somethings to write about after I make the style and story decisions about where to go with them. 

Course, I've also been bitten by the gambling bug recently, so I'm watching poker two or three nights a week on various channels to get a feeling for Texas Hold'em so I can start playing it online. 

I guess that will do for a quick hit on my life to the moment. Now if I can only bring myself to update my web page I'll be doing great.

Whew. The subject says it all. This is a quick hit update as I am trying to get other things done. I finished my move and now reside in St. Louis at my new job. The apartment is packed with boxes as I don't have anywhere to put my stuff just yet (need to buy some new bookshelves) and something of an obstacle course to traverse. My work shift, at the moment, consists of four weeks of 8 to 4, Monday through Friday followed by a three day weekend, a ten day block of work, and then another three day weekend. I came in 'just' at the right time so Thanksgiving week was the 4th week, meaning that I'm off on Monday and then work 10 days straight from Tuesday through to a future Thursday. 

I did have a quiet thanksgiving complete with turkey, which was kind of cool. But I am having some difficulties with my contracting company, to whit they haven't paid me yet. I tried to deal with it on Friday, but of course no one was in the office in the afternoon and when I called in the morning my rep was out and the payroll guy was at lunch.

I have also developed a new pet peeve... Specifically all of the hospitals and drug companies who are putting those wonderful advertisements on TV and Radio. The ones about various physical conditions or emotional troubles. All about how you might be a clinical depressive or have a chance of injuring your throat from heartburn or... You know, the ones that are presented as being in your best interest but are really about drug companies trying to push their product on everyone they can or hospitals trying to up their profits by bringing in more patients. Those commercials are really torqueing me these days. :)

But I'll save that rant for a longer update. I have two more days of my five day weekend, not counting today, and I need to get a lot done during them."

"event","Just to warn the curious, this is a /large/ update. It's been a while since I last let anything go, so there's a lot to tell.And I will go in order of what strikes my mind.

1. New Job -

     Since last I updated, I recieved a new job offer and accepted it. I'm off to St. Louis now to meet up with some former co-workers and begin work for TEK Systems contracted out to AT&T's backbone group. Since I currently live in Marina, Ca. this has entailed a great deal of work. I've turned in my resignation at CSU-MB (in fact my last day is today) and made moving arrangements. I am working, now, on the where to live arrangements on the far side. And making a decision about what to do with 5 months of CalPers payments. I expect I will opt out of the program at this point, there isn't enough invested to worry about it.

2. Friend Changes

     Been a weird few months as far as my friendships have gone. I'm getting back into the habit of talking to one old friend (who reads this livejournal), but two other friendships have pretty much come to an end. One quite recently. Apparently I betrayed this friend by not spreading gossip/betraying a confidence, so I guess I'll have to live with the consequences. It has definitely left me thinking that I need to stop being so tolerant of women with 'issues' in my life. They're nice, but the little neurotic landmines are just too much for me to want to deal with. 

     A second friendship also seems to have come to an end. But that friend at least got 'parting gifts'. I suppose because she really was a good friend for most of the time. There were a lot of issues I had to get a handle on and she helped me to do that. I suppose we both helped each other a lot, which is why I will miss her. Still, the world goes on.

3. St. Louis
     When I mentioned former co-workers at my new jobs, there are also friends. Several of my friends from college and before are in the St. Louis area. So I'll be renewing old relationships. In fact...

4. Rebirths and Renewals

     Though a lot of things with my relationships have been going south, several of my friendships have been showing they are real. Friends who I have been out of touch with, or who disputes have caused problems with, are showing up in my life again. Who would believe that my first longterm girlfriend would still be my friend after all this time. At this point, we met about 13 years ago. And that isn't even the oldest. A friend of mine from /high school/ and I have been finding our old differences aren't as important as they once seemed. He taught me a lot about friendships. Even when he and I couldn't be in the same room I still considered him a friend. And others are peeking back in. I suppose good friends are forever. They're the people who will be there with you even if it's been months or years since you last spoke. If you need them, they will be there.

5. Travel!

     Doesn't it just figure? No sooner than I'd managed to store up a week's worth of vacation I'm leaving the job and heading out. Fortunately my new job doesn't start until the 18th and I am driving out. This will give me plenty of time to stop off and visit with my friends who are en route. Veronica in Truckee. Morgan and Alix in Denver. David and my grandmother in Kansas City. I'll be seeing a lot of people and having the time to enjoy their company. And at the same time I will be getting several days away from the hectic push. Several days driving through scenic countryside and seeing some very beautiful parts of states. It should be very relaxing and meditative around being frustrating and nerve-wracking as I am stressing about getting everywhere I need to. 

So, to sum up, lots of friend changes and a big life change (a new job) are slamming their way into my consciousness. Being the crotchety Taurus that I am, I never can seem to decide if change scares me or excites me. I suppose it does a bit of both and it always will do so.

In madness, surprise, and hope...

"event","Well, the weekend is over and I'm back at work. It was a mostly uneventful weekend due to my need to take it easy on my legs. One of the exercises I did left my calves aching for several days. Other than that I did a bit of laundry and some housework. Next weekend is a party that I'll be driving up to, hopefully to have a wild and debauched time, more likely to have a tame but enjoyable time.

I did watch some football this weekend, and after having watched a few days worth of games I have to admit the Broncos and the Patriots are both looking very strong thus far in the season. And most of the teams I would chear on appear to be on the wrong side of the whipping stick, alas.

*hmms* Let's see. I've talked to a few people about a response I got to an old personals add I had on an alternative website. The girl was so very young that I was not, at first, particularly interested. But then I saw her photos. Being who I am, I couldn't tell you what her eye color was or even really describe what she looked like, beyond a casual thought that there was too much makeup, but her hair was /lovely/. Dark brown and long past her waist. Mmmm. I admit it, I have a weakness for women with long, dark hair. Hair is so fun to play with. Guess I should adjust the profile to note that I am looking for women with long hair. *grins*

Also tried to get in touch with some friends, failed most of those attempts, but got a call from a friend I used to date a little. We spent about an hour chatting about random topics and that was kind of cool. Also reminded me that I need to start getting out of the apartment more. Maybe find a sports bar to go watch the games at. I suppose I'll see. But for those around who might want to comment, here is a question: Is 21 too young for a 31 year old?"

"event","Well, anyone who knows me knows that I can't be relied upon to update anything with regularity. So I have faith they weren't expecting much. If anyone who doesn't know me has even found this journal, I'd be amazed. That little note aside, here comes today's sporadic update.

Life is... Well, my life never seems to be easy to describe. This week featured a few highlights and amusing moments which will now be listed in stream of consciousness order.

Wednesday is the day that comes to mind. I dealt with the 9/11 anniversary in my own way which I won't go into. But it did have an impact on my day, consciously and not. Wednesday was one of those days where I looked into the mirror and was absolutely jarred out of my socks by the dichotomy between my appearance now and my self-image. And it was /not/ a happy jarring. At one point in college, I had fought my weight down to something like 163 lbs, so standing on the scale and weighing in at 243 just blew my mind in a bad way. It had happened before, and various eating healthy routines/exercise programs had begun, but none of them stuck. This time, though, I'd just had it. So I started exercising again. And have begun researching to set myself up with a good diet/exercise program to get back into the condition I was in as recently as two years ago.

Of course, a new exercise program comes with aches and pains, and I have several of those in my calves right now from working them in ways they are distinctly un-used to. And my diet has definitely been a thing with the occasional stumbles.

Added to this was a weird occurrence on Tuesday. Right around the time I first moved to California (July of '99 for those keeping score), I was doing some 'open-minded sexual explorations'. Or, more succinctly put, I was exploring BDSM. I hadn't had a steady relationship in a while, and finding scene folk to date has always been a difficult thing for me, so I hooked myself up with an account on an online alternative lifestyles personals page, alt.com. For probably the first year I was out here, I was frequently in the chat rooms of the site, and avidly kept track of what went on with my profile. But for a variety of reasons, that settled down to a standstill.

So, anyway, on Tuesday I log into one of my old accounts there for no particular reason and discover that someone had sent me a letter on the site saying they liked my profile and would like me to email. I checked the date, assuming the contact time would be ancient, and found that it had been sent on September 9th. I emailed her as requested, if only to be polite, and got a response in return. I replied to that one as well, and that is where everything has pulled up to a standstill for now. I probably wouldn't even have replied, but the synchronicity of my logging in less than 24 hours after the letter had first been sent amused me. 

The girl who sent the letter is 21, usually placed as too young on my age scale. And sent a picture along with her information. Sadly, one of my big weaknesses is hair, and she has lovely long hair down past her waist. Long hair that, when braided, still hangs down past her waist. So I find myself amenable to talking with her further, should the opportunity arise.

Thursday, another friend from alt.com found me online. A very attractive friend from England who I had not heard from in ages. And we caught up a bit on how each of our lives has been going. At the time I began to mentally wonder if someone had tacked mistletoe over my door or something, the sudden rush of women appearing back in my life having me confused. (If two doesn't seem like a sudden rush, it's because I have neglected to mention two more old friends/flames who have made contact with me again in the past month or so.)

While all of this was going on, my work project made some twitching signs like it was going to come back to life, but the twitchings were a false start so far, and my project remains flat-lined for a while. My second project at work hasn't materialized yet, and may not given some gossip I heard recently, and my third work project had its first meeting. A two hour session talking with Cisco folks about a conversion that is schedule to take place in January. Of these three events only the third was of real interest because it gave me something to do at work this week besides read football updates and chat with folks on mushes.

*glances back over what he's written so far*
Yep, very stream of consciousness. But a pretty good example of how wonderfully ordered (sarcasm *tm) my life and thought process has been lately. 

You know, the real problem with an affinity for trickster gods is that you have to be good at living in a constant state of Chaos. Sadly for me, Taurus is exactly a dynamic astrological sign, so I sit, craving stability amidst a funnel of dynamism.

Having said nothing that made any sense, I think I'll leave off for now, with well wishes for any who are reading this.

"event","Well, life is never stable. The tribulations of the last year seemed to finally be coming to an end, but that was not to last it seems. Just a week ago it seemed like everything has stabilized. There was still chaos, but I had learned how to relax within it and let it sweep around while I stayed in my safe little globe; pushed but trusting. Of course, that was a week ago. Since then the world has taken a few hits.

Some of my former co-workers landed in St.Louis. They've been working there for about six months, if I remember correctly, and are relatively content. Now, it seems, their group is short-handed, so they've been recruiting some of us folks who used to work with them.

I had thought that everything was stable, actually. Or I suppose had hoped. But now I'm once again being faced with the choice to stay or move. And it isn't an easy choice to make. The new job is closer to my family. It's more money in a market where things cost less. It is a chance, really, to get a lot of my debts paid off, and what does it matter if I finish college in California or Missouri?

So needless to say that has been a big focus of thinking. A few of my relationships are also a bit muddled. I don't, in truth, feel comfortable around several of my old friends anymore. So the old relationships are changing. I wonder, occasionally, if I just got into the habit of separating from friends every few years when I was young. I wasn't an army brat, like so many I know, but my step-father was a gunslinger of a sort. He worked for Gilbert-Robinson and was sent from operation to operation to improve their numbers. So with him I moved a lot. Roughly every two years, if my memory serves. And I got to the point where I didn't really pay attention to where I was living other than to go to school.

That's really neither here nor there, though. Just a strange foray into stream of consciousness thinking.

In better news, I am striving to set up a Fantasy Football league with my old PS2 football foe, Morgan. My project at work seems to be moving forward a little bit and may actually see completion before I die. And it seems like the light at the end of the money tunnel is coming and that I am about to have balanced back out some of the debt of my long unemployment. 

*laughs*
Okay, I spoke too soon. The bozo 'project manager' for my project just showed up. Here comes politics and stupidity all wrapped up in one neat little package. *sighs* Well, I'll just try to ignore him, even though my lead isn't here to run interference today. *laughs again* The mad coyote's gambit is ongoing and sometimes I think it will never end."

friday i woke up in a good mood. i havnt felt like that in a while. i got out of bed and turned on rhcp. my day started out really good, but right when first period rolled around it tunrned into a shitty one. it got worst throughout the day. but anyway. i didnt go to the dance. me and jess decided not to go to the movies... but we ended up going anyway. i saw and old friend =] .. so i was happy. and i also saw jake. which was nice. i havnt seen that kid in forever. i miss him =[. so saturday was our so called get together. it wasnt really a get together if u ask me. me jess and sam went to the island. they magically disapeared and i watched the rest of the sun set by myself. it was really pretty. so we finally left. sunday i came home. i still feel like shit. i dont kno what to do. well im gunna leave it at that.

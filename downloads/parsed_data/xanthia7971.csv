"event","Today wasn't that bad of a day. I got home around 4 and we went to jackson. I got my brothers birthday present, i'm sure he'll be excited to receive them. I'm kind of interested in a guy named Tommy right now, but he's a mormon and i'm not sure how that would work out. I'm pretty tolerant of other religions but if he ends up wanting me to convert its not going to happen. I have quite a bit of homework for shakespeare, well not really just reading three acts. We read a little bit of it in class and surprise surprise theater majors dominated the reading. Now i know not all of them are loud but i'm sorry majority of them are. That class would be SOOOO much better with just english majors. I'd have a better chance of getting an A  and yes it will effect my grade, due to the fact that participation counts big in schnapps class and its hard to beat out the 25 theater majors for a part in reading, but alas such is life. I probably should have waited and taken it my senior year, but i think its only offered every so often. Spanish tutoring starts up next week, not looking forward to that. Monday will be a wasted day where i'd rather be at home then sitting in the apartment but nothing i can do about it. Thats pretty much all i have to bitch about so i'd say lifes relatively good right now especially on the romantic front."

"event","So i hate spanish even more than i did yesterday. Today Renato said i needed to be more patient than he is. Ugh! stupid renato. just for not saying si before quiero cantar a la lata. fricken retarded class! lol. Well i got through my wednesday. The education class wasnt that bad, 3 hour classes go okay as long as your doing busy work, makes the time go by more quickly. Turns out i'm going to have to do a ten day lesson plan which should be oh so much fun....not. I already know i'm doing mine on shakespeare. Seems like everything i'm doing that are big projects this year is going to be on shakespeare. I'm in Shakespeare class so maybe that has a part in it lol. I'm going to like that class i think, but i'm not entirely sure yet how its going to pan out with all the theater majors in that class. Today is a pretty full load for me. I had class from 10-10:50 then i have an hour break which i'm wasting away in led lobby on a computer because i don't feel like walking back over to the apartment. Then i have class from 12-1:15 work 1:30-3:30 and class from 4-4:50. Oh well at least that way i dont have to walk back and forth from the apartment and i'll be done with class by 6, maybe my english secondary methods course will get out earlier, who knows. Its with a professor i've never had or heard of before so i don't know what to expect, it'll probably be really boring. My ex boyfriend might come visit me tonight, not sure. I haven't seen chad in forever, at least like 2 years, so that should be interesting. He was one of my favorite people in high school, so entertaining and all that stuff i love in a guy so it'll be fun to get to hang out with him again. As far as james goes he called me last night, made me pretty happy because i hadn't talked to him on the phone for at least two days. He misses me and i think thats sweet :) maybe i'll get to hang out with him during the weekend, it would be nice. I'm a little pissed off that i have to come back to school on sunday just for a meeting when we dont even have school on monday. But i guess thats what someone decided last semester so we have to follow it, i'm contemplating missing the meeting because really thats ridiculous. but thats pretty much all thats going on now."

"event","just a quick little note before i go to spanish, today is my worst day of classes, i have my 3 hour night class tonight and i'm not looking forward to it at all, oh well at least it gets out at 7:45 instead of 8:45 this year, maybe i can actually watch my tv shows now. other than that i have a lunch date with my mom after spanish which should be fun, it'll get me through spanish at least, i hate that class already-3 days in...not looking good. Good thing its only 50 minutes each day. Shakespeare is full of theater majors and i'm not happy about that at all, its an english class but unfortunately the theater majors are required to take it.....bleck, they better not ruin my chances of an A in that class with their loud mouths. Well thats all for now, wish me luck on my worst day of classes :)"

"event","Well i dont really know what i got myself into, but i sure did get myself into something. James has been really sweet the past few weeks and has wanted to talk to me on the phone or face to face for a long time. I was talking to him online today and he asked me if i ever thought about dating, i mistook him for meaning other people and i said yea that i'd date two people and one wouldnt work out and the other only wants me for sex. I asked him what about him and he  said he was thinking about giving it a shot if i wanted to try it because otherwise it doesnt work out. We then went on to have a conversation about how neither of us has really dated since we broke up. James mentioned if we could just date and have it be exclusive but not real serious, no commitment issues, he asked if that'd still be dating i said yea but it's kind of exclusive and he's like yea its like faithfully dating lol. So i guess i'm faithfully dating james now,  not really official but i'm pretty sure thats what we're going to end up doing. weird to be back in this situation so quickly, i pretty much knew we'd be back together sometime but i didn't think it'd be this soon. I have a feeling we're both going to like the dating thing, it'll be whats easiest since i'm in school. We'll probably end up together when he's ready to commit anyways. I definitely won't have sex with him for a long time to make sure he isnt dating me just to have sex, james isnt that type of guy but better safe than sorry they always say. so yay for not having to be lonely all the time anymore, for having someone to call up and say hey wanna go to the movies :) i'm excited."

Other than that my gifts are awesome. I finally got my yellow hoodie i've been wanting for years, its a soft type and mom and dad got some pants to go with it, kind of like a lazy suit lol. I got a new laundry bag and new pillow cases, needed both of those, new tennis shoes, a blanket, new bras, fun socks,new pajamas, some country apple spray, some slippers, a model ship, two amethyst rings, a gift card to bath and body works and one to victorias secret (i'll be going to the mall) a toy airplane, scene it harry potter version, a watch with changable face plates and bands, and thats all i can remember, there was just too much. But yea it was definitely a good christmas. We had some chicken for dinner and afterward we played scene it and i won, of course lol. Hope everyone had as good a christmas as i did."

"event","So all that work i had assigned that i didn't think i'd ever be able to get done while enjoying my break, guess what i did!!! i'm so happy about it. I'm pretty much done with work for the semester so the next week will be studying for exams. Its crazy to think that this semester is almost over. Its pretty much flown by. My break has been wonderful so far. Gavin's been home most of the time and we've bonded. We've played monopoly quite a few times, he kicked my ass the first time, i kicked his the second, and then dad joined in and gavin beat us all. It was nice to win that once though. It'll be nice to enjoy the rest of the weekend without any worries of getting papers and homework done. Right now i'm watching QVC with my mom and trying to get some more ideas on my christmas list. Wednesday gavin and i went shopping and i'm done with my family, yay! go me! So now all thats left is my sorority girls gift and my cousin erica's gift. My stress levels have dropped considerably now that i'm done with my papers and have found a lesson to teach that involves a newspaper. so yup i'm pretty much just happy for once. Yay, i'm hoping it stays this way."

"event","I'm so fucking sick and tired of people. I am sick of dealing with problems, i'm sick of people getting upset about things i say when i wasnt even fucking talking about them. I'm sick of fricken girls! they are so much gosh damn drama its ridiculous. i get rid of one problem and poof here comes another one. Guys get up in your face, solve the problem, and move on. Can girls do that? No! why? because they're stupid. I'm not speaking my mind anymore, seems how everyone just thinks i'm a bitch, instead i will just fume inside and then privately explode with anger like i used to do. Hopefully that fucking works, if not then i just wont give a damn because obviously i cant please everyone and when people think i'm mad for walking fast thats just a tad bit on the ridiculous side. Maybe if you'd get to know me we wouldnt have so many problems. GAHHHHHHHH!!! hate it. in other news i have 4 pages of my 8 page paper done, which is pretty good. It means less work for me on thanksgiving break. Speaking of thanksgiving break i can't fricken wait until it comes. Gavin asked me if i wanted to go shopping on tuesday for christmas. christmas shopping already, man i'll have it done early. That'll be saweet! I think thats pretty much all thats going on in my life right now. Peace out!"

"event","Today was a good day for the most part, i think i'm happier and that i'm making an effort so that people will enjoy being around me more often. Yes that means sometimes i will have to put on a front and pretend that i am happy, but i think it'll be good for me in the long run as long as i dont hold my feelings in all the time and have an outlet. Went to karaoke tonight, kind of upset that i didn't get to sing my Hero song or my duet with jessy, but next week for sure. I really hate the people in my hallway, they're always loud blasting music, dribbling basketballs, and all sorts of other racket that is not necessary. I have a date on saturday as long as everything pulls through and he doesnt have to work. I'm kind of excited about it, i havent seen him in months and i've missed him. I also have a friends going away party that night. He's a friend from high school and is going into the marines. I wish him all the luck and safety that god can afford him. Papers are still stressing me out. I need to get started on three of them like now. I need to read all for love, i need to finish reading pamela, i need to figure out what articles to write for spectra this month, if anyone has any ideas let me know. The end of the semester is so stressful, i cant believe that there is only like a month until finals. I really need to go shopping for food tomorrow, if not i'm going to be in trouble, i'll also have to put some gas in my vehicle as well. I guess i can do that in the time slot of 6-9. Alright its late i need to get to bed. Night loves."

"event","Okay lets talk about how i don't like being at school anymore. I enjoy my time at home 10 times more than i do school usually. I'm sick of all the drama that follows me around, drama that i don't cause yet it somehow comes to attack me. I'm sick of being in a sorority where girls are not considerate of others, they dont ask before they go and do things that directly affect you, and there is no communication. Lets talk about how depending on how tonight goes i might deactivate. I'm not proud of the group i'm in right now. I don't feel like we are representing good things anymore. If it continues this way i want out. Don't worry i wont make the decision without a lot of reflection and thinking. I'm ready for thanksgiving break. I'm ready for christmas break. I also think i'm getting sick, which definitely isnt a good thing. yea i think i have a form of the flu, just fricken great. On top of all these things i'm stressed out about the 4 papers i have to do soon, one being 8-10 pages that i have to read a play for as well, while reading another book on top of that. I hate when professors load you with work to do in the last month. They need to learn to space things out more. I think i'll just be glad when the semester is over."

"event","so due to recent events i will probably not be attending our fall formal. Thats fine though i won't have to pay a 15 dollar ticket price for something i wont enjoy. Kinda sucks though because it would have been fun before everything got ruined. Seems like thats my luck usually. i'm still really pissed off about the whole ordeal, friends dont do that to friends but what the fuck ever i've never really had friends anyway. I'll have to get over it eventually and i will i just dont like being treated like shit with no regards for my feelings. Then again i should have known better than to ask who i asked to go with me. It didnt end well last year so that should have been something that stopped me from asking him. Oh well what can you do right? its not my fault things turned out the way they did, it was totally out of my control. Karaoke was kind of fun last night minus all the bullshit i had to see. I sang 3 songs, didnt do too well on the first one but i think the second two went well. I got an 87 on my journalism paper that i thought i did better on, i'm really disappointed in the grade i got. They published my article in spectra though which was pretty neat. Nothing really happy to report unfortunately. So if you want to cheer me up ask me to do things hang out with me i need friends, i dont really have them."

I've always been one of the convenient friends, the one you go to when all of your other better friends are gone or busy doing things. I dont like being the third wheel, or the back up plan. I'm really sick of it. I'm almost tempted to just stop having these down the line friends at all, maybe revert back to my lonely self i mean when i want to do something there usually isnt anyone there anyways, other than for dinner.

Then i came back to my room and talked to my brother for an hour and helped him set up his myspace. He told me his shift change put him on 1st shift so i'll be seeing a lot more of him than i did when he worked 2nds which is really good. I'm happy about that. Then we went to the pi lams party which kicked ass. I played some blackjack and did pretty damn good. Then i proceeded to get really drunk have a great time singing karaoke with jessy and the girls, cut my hand on a cap and bled a bit, used duck tape as a band aid which let me tell you was pretty damn hot and i asked zac to formal and he said yea so yay i have a date now. Oh and i had my first tequila shot complete with salt and lemon juice, thanks to chad lol. Lots of fun and happy things and i really needed that so yay!

Being busy from 6am to 5pm after a shitty night of sleep isnt really my idea of a good time. The weekend was good. I got to hang out with my family and actually spent some time with my brother for once. We played Xbox of course. MK:Armageddon is a pretty decent game. My mom asked me if any of the guys i knew were prospective husbands and got disappointed when i was like no. I'm 20 years old. I don't need to have so in so in my mind for marriage. Then she asked me if i was planning on being an old spinster because thats the way i was acting, like some guys just going to fall out of the sky whenever i'm ready to get involved. I thought that was really shitty of her considering i just got out of a relationship a little over a month ago. Sorry if guys don't throw themselves at me, i'm not skinny and i'm not pretty i don't know why she's expecting that of me. I don't know i guess i'm bitter over that. On another note i fucking hate construction. Jackson is stock full of it and i almost got lost on the way back from getting my birth control gah!!! not a good day. I'm ready to call it a day. I need to stop touching my face, its a really bad habit that causes me to break out making me even more ugly. I hope this depressing mood i'm in goes away soon. I'm not any fun when i'm sad.

"event","So the worst part of the observation was the fact that i got lost on the way there and on the way back. The actual observation wasnt bad, its a relaxed classroom and the kids swear and stuff, but they aren't dangerous like people were making them sound. I'm really glad i got to figure that out. Friday was pretty much just a movie day because it was the end of the marking period for them. They showed movies i can't even imagine watching in college like fat girls, benchwarmers, and TI something. Lots of swearing and sexual content. The teacher i'm observing for is mr. mclellan and he's really nice, he asked me if i just preferred to observe or if i actually like to interact with the kids and i told him i preferred to just observe and he said that was fine and thats what he used to do and that we were going to get along really well because i'd be easy to deal with. So there goes my fears of urban observation. Once i get a nice route down that i don't get lost in the only bad thing will be the gas. It's actually going to take me less time to get my 60 hours in than i thought because school starts at 7:30 and i leave at 12. That's 4.5 hours when i thought i'd only be getting 4. So instead of 8 hours each week i'll be getting 9. But yea defiinitely glad it wasnt what i was expecting. I'm fricken exhausted though. having to leave to observe at 6:30 in the morning is rough. its going to be even rougher on mondays when i dont have a chance to relax until after dinner. Thats why i absolutely refuse to do it on wednesdays, 6-9 at night will not cut it for me. Today was bid day and it was a lot of fun. I'm only disappointed that we didnt get pam but the girls are really sweet and fun. Not to mention that we went bowling and i got a 193. Woot for me. i miss bowling a lot, i forgot how much fun it could be. But yea thats pretty much life right now, nothing too horrible but also nothing too great."

He should have thought about that before he begged me to date him again. I told him it'd be hard i told him we'd barely see each other and he told me it'd be fine. But now he's going back on his word. He says he's confused and he doesnt think it'll work with me in college. This sucks i hate it. I dont want to be single again. I liked having someone be there for me. I just blah. hate this. I have piano at 4 that should be fun. Not. Blah if he breaks up with me life is going to suck for a long long while. So i really hope this isnt the end for us. I'm kind of just at a loss of what to do.

Kelly offered to take me to get a blood test tonight because they are more accurate and can detect trace amounts of the hormone HCG in the blood stream. Whoo fun times. I really hate this, this worrying is taking a big toll on me, i'll be glad when its over. I just hope i'm not pregnant, if i am i'm going to have to go against my own morals and get an abortion done. I'm praying to god that doesnt happen. I hope its just the change in environment and stuff. Nurse Norma thinks thats a really good possibility. Other than that life is ok. I don't really like my classes at all but i get through them. I got to see James on sunday and it was really nice and he was really sweet to me. I feel really bad because his grandpa is sick. I'm trying to be there for him and let him know i'm there for him but so far he hasnt really needed me for anything. Probably good i'm not real good at situations like this. Man he had his glasses on and a red hoodie, he lookes effing hot lol. I'm glad he actually kissed me like he missed me, it was really good to see him. I'll get to see him on friday because its my birthday. I'm hoping by then i'll know i'm not pregnant. That'd be a really good birthday present for me. I'm wondering if he's going to get me anything for my birthday. I guess it'd be fine if he didnt, i'll be happy just to be able to spend some time with him again.

Its our 2 month anniversary and i get a call at 7 saying that his grandpa was just admitted into the hospital and he's going to go over there for the night. He asked me if that was ok and i said yea and then he actually said i love you first which was nice. he got off the phone i cried for no reason, i've never met his grandpa so it couldnt be because of that. I hope that his grandpa turns out ok he said he'd call me tomorrow and let me know how he was doing. I still havent started my period. I took my second test today and it came out negative again. I think if i havent had it by tuesday i'm going to go to nurse norma and have her give me a pregnancy test which will be embarrassing but oh well. I got a letter in the mail today that said that i get free birth control and clinic visits now. That'll be great if i ever start my period. Birth control isnt cheap afterall. I also finally got my english book in the mail that came from hawaii so that was a good thing. I wish i could just start so i would stop worrying about it. IT'd make my life a lot better right now. This weekend should be fun so maybe it'll take my mind off of it. Then next week is my birthday :) thursday night we're having a party at jayna and danielles at like 7:30 for me jayna and sam. It'll be a ton of fun. Then friday i'm coming home for a birthday dinner with my mom and dad and james and maybe grandma and papa. So i'm kinda looking forward to next week.

"event","So i made it through the first week of school. Having three english classes in one day isnt much fun. Piano is ok but i've never had any kind of music class before and cant read music. Urban education sounds scary, 60 clock hours in a urban classroom observing....yuck. James and i had a really good talk today that was need. He told me what pisses him off that i do and i think that'll be really helpful. He hates when i doubt his feeling for me and worry that he is going to break up with me so i have to stop doing that. It also pissed him off when i told him someone wanted me to cheat on him with them, so i cant say shit like that anymore. I did get an answer on whether or not he still loves me as much as he did when he first started dating me. He said that of course he did and why wouldnt he. He gets so frustrated when i dont believe the stuff he says to me but its so hard for me. I'm not used to someone loving me like that so its hard for me to believe. Other than that the only thing going on in my life is me being scared that i'm pregnant. I really hope that isnt the situation. Tomorrow will be my first day thats absolutely considered late, but my schedule fluctuates so i have no idea. I know the longest cycle thats considered normal is 35 days long and it can be up to 42 i think. I took a pregnancy test already and it came out negative so i hope that it is negative. it'd just be nice if it would start and then i could stop stressing about it. My cat is laying on a blanket thats covering up my legs right now and its really cute. My family is having a camp out for labor day at my house so my relatives will be coming down and staying in campers in the yard which should be weird and kind of fun at the same time. I'm kind of sad that the sorority has gone down so much in numbers. We were at like 18 and we lost kati, irma, jessica, and now jamie. Its a sad thing, but hopefully we'll get our numbers back up during formal recruitment."

"event","Moms are really crazy. You think you know them and you think you know the reaction they will have to things and they react totally different. I told my mom today that james and i had sex and that i had just gone and got on birth control and her expected reaction was anger and yelling her actual reaction was to say that i'm 20 she can't control what i do with my life anymore and she'd rather i wait until i'm married but she's glad i'm being responsible and on birth control. I should  have just told her to begin with. Would have saved a lot of worrying on my part but i'm glad she knows now so if i have any problems with it i can talk to her about it. James came over last night. In my opinion he's acting kind of weird. We barely kissed each other. There were signs of affection but just not what i'm used to i guess. Oh well he still says he loves me so i guess i better stop worrying. I'm just afraid that he's going to break up with me and i really dont want that to happen because i love him a lot. I need to go school shopping. I guess i can do that on sunday. Seems how we have to check in by 1 which in my opinion is kind of retarded. I wish we could check in later because i dont want to be there all day sitting doing nothing when i could have one more day with my boyfriend. He can't even help me move because he has to work. Gah! its going to be hard. He told me that the weekend after i move he probably wont be around and then some month he'll have his fire training on the weekends so he wont see me that whole month. Its just going to be hard. I guess we'll just have to talk a lot on the internet or the phone and hope to god that pulls us through. At least we'll really value the time that we do get to spend together."

"event","Man the past 3 days have pretty much blown. I was disappointed in my boyfriend for not calling me on wednesday to check if everything went alright i felt that he didnt take enough interest in my life and he didnt show he cared. Then yesterday i freezer burnt my ring and middle finger on both hands and today they feel a lot worse and you can see the marks of freezer burn. So i put some salve on some band aids and then put those on my fingers. So then just a few minutes ago today i go outside to give mom her dinner i made her and on the way back inside i step on a piece of fucking glass and start bleeding all over. wooo! lots of fun here. My boyfriend also told me today that it doesnt matter to him what i'm doing and when i'm doing it. It should matter damnit. He should want to know my schedule he should want to know where i am and what i'm doing. He should care whats going on in my life and sometimes i just dont feel like he does. So after yelling at him last night about not calling me i yell at him today for saying that. I'm sick of yelling at him, i want to be good, i want to have things be ok. I feel like i'm losing him and i hate it. He told me today that he thought about me going to college and that its going to be hard. That scares me, usually he's all like it'll be fine. I wish i knew that we'd be okay, i wish i knew that we'd stay together but i dont and i'm scared. I dont know how to make it so that our relationship will survive the 3 years i'm in college. I hate this. I did ask him to break up with me if he thought that we wouldnt make it, i told him i'd rather have it done now then later and he said he can see it working we just might not see each other a lot and i might be disappointed. I dont think it'll be that bad when i'll be busy at school and actually have stuff to do then sit around if we dont end up hanging out. But yea thats life right now. I packed up a bunch of stuff for going back to siena i'm not excited i dont want to come back but i hate packing so i figured i'd get it done. So now its a matter of just throwing it in my vehicle so i wont have to get up as early next sunday which is good.  that is all"

"event","So yesterday turned out fine. Mom did call work but i was there and i got paid and cindy lied for me and it was all just fantastic. After work jayna and i left for planned parenthood and it took FOREVER to get there. I was 20 minutes late for my appointment time but thankfully that didnt really mean any thing. I hate when you go somewhere and you have to fill out like 8 forms of information about you. Its like sure let me just hand you over a transcript of my whole effing life story. But yea the exam was good no problems and i got my nuvaring! I wont be able to start it until like august 29th but still i'm excited. James and i kinda got in a tiff about him not calling me yesterday. In my opinion he should have called me because he knew i was scared of the appointment and he knew that it was a big day for me. He should have called to either wish me good luck or to ask me how it went, but i got neither. He was helping a friend move and ""lost track of time"". Also when i called him it never registered on his phone. Oh well he was apologetic today and he could tell that it really bothered me that he didnt call or anything so hopefully in the future if i have anything big going on he'll call and ask how it went. He did email me at like 12:30 at work and ask me how it went so thats something i guess. I love the guy a lot and i need to stop getting upset over stupid stuff, but i think that it might help us in the long run. its unbelievable that we go back to school in 10 days. Im not ready for it. I dont want to think  about starting to pack and getting clothes around to take with me and all that yucky nonsense. I dont want to think about buying my education books and leaving my boyfriend 40 miles behind. I'm going to miss him like crazy. I just really don't want to go this year. At least monday i only have one class and its at 4 so i can ease my way into going to class. That is all."

"event","so today is my appointment for my birth control. Its turning out to be quite the mess. Cindy from work called yesterday and mom got the message that i didn't have to work. So she wasnt going to let me come to adrian to hang out with Jayna because she said it was a waste of gas and that i should meet jayna half way. So i ended up lying to her telling her that i got an email from work saying that they had found work for me to do so i'd have to be going to adrian anyway. So she thinks i'm lying and is going to call my boss Cindy today to verify that i was supposed to be at work. Good thing she'll lie for me if she has to. So far she hasnt called though. Right after work i'll be heading to ann arbor to get on my birth control. I hope that the appointment goes quickly and painlessly. James is still sick. He's calling a doctor today to set up an appointment. I'm praying for him to get better soon and if you want you can too, it'd help :). I just want him to be healthy and happy and right now he's neither. So i hope god will help james out because he deserves it he's a sweetheart. i go back to school in 11 days. I'm supposed to move in the 24th but i can't because i have to work and it sucks because i'm going to miss quality time with my sisters. But that's pretty much all thats going on with my life. I just had a wrap at subway for lunch, i didn't even know that they had wraps. It was pretty yummy. I also used my higher one card/1st debit card ever to purchase my lunch so that was kinda fun. But yea excited to see jayna tonight, excited to finally not have to worry about getting pregnant...woot!"

"event","So james came over yesterday and spent the night. We were alone for the whole day so that was fun, we really never get a chance to be alone together. I tried to sleep with him, had him spend the night and sleep in my bed with me but yet again i wasnt able to sleep. I dont get why i cant sleep with him. I dont think i can sleep with any guy. i wish i could figure out why i cant. Its not just sleeping with another person in my bed because when we went camping i had to sleep on the same air mattress as kelly. Maybe it was because he kinda slept diagonal and cramped my sleeping space. Yesterday part of the tree we have in our front yard cracked. Two of the limbs split off and it was really weird. Lol i was in bed with james and i was like what was that noise? and he's like it was the bed. Lmao. he's such a dork. I beat him in air hockey. I think he let me win but i'm not sure. I probably would have been pissed off if he beat me because i'm really competitive like that. 3 more days and i have my birth control appointment. I'm really glad that i wont have to worry about getting preganant anymore. I'm not sure when its going to take effect but at the latest it should be september 5th. I just hope it doesnt make me depressed and all that fun stuff. I kind of hate sundays they are really boring and theres never anything to do. I havent even taken a shower and gotten dressed yet. I wish that james and i were hanging out today, but that might be overkill. He's spent a lot of time with me this week. I hope next week is like that because we go back to school in like 2 weeks and then i'll only be seeing him on the weekends. but yea thats my update, wooo"

I helped him put together his bowflex and then we took a drive in his new explorer that i advised him against getting. Oh well its nice it has an all leather interior. After that we went to his room and watched tv and stuff. I love the guy so much. Saturday my parents are going out of town so i'm having him over and he's staying the night. i'm really looking forward to the quality time we'll be spending together. I've seen him a lot this week and i love it. and i love that he's actually seeming to want to hang out now like he misses me as much as i miss him. Its fantastic. I love my life right now. 6 days and i get to go for my appt with jayna. I hope everything goes well. It would be the suck if it didn't. But yea pretty much i'm excited and happy and yay :) I think i'm going to hang out with danielle tomorrow which will be good. I hate just sitting around not doing a damn thing. It'll help pass the time, woot! We'll probably do our usual go get some coffee and then swing in the park. yay for friends and boyfriends and just overall good times"

"event","So i just got my letter from Siena that says what my phone number is and everything. And where it says you can contact your roomie at the following address mine is blank. Last year i had the same thing and ended up in a room alone. That would kick ass. It'd be nice to be able to have my boyfriend come up and stay the weekend with me if he ever wanted to, or at least the night. Speaking of my boyfriend we've been having some minor problems recently which really can be summed up by saying that i'm a bitch lol. Sometimes i feel like i cant talk to him and that he doesnt want to talk to me, that he's more interested in the movie he's already seen and can watch whenever he'd like than hanging out with his girlfriend. Then i thought about it and we dont really have anything to talk about, he's sick and has been for a while, he works too much and has to split his free time between his family and me and it gets frustrating for him sometimes and i really need to stop being selfish about it and appreciate the time i do have with him. I dont know but it seems like he'd want to spend as much time as possible with me before i head off to school and we wont be able to see each other a lot. Other than that we have retreat this weekend. It should be a lot of fun but it'll be stressful as well, especially since i'm one of the main coordinators and people still havent told me who they are riding with. So sisters if your reading this fill me in. Then sunday night when i get back i have to work 3rd shift and monday night i work 3rd shift as well. Yuck. Its going to be a hell of a 5 days. Im going to miss james the 3 days i'm gone and i'll be glad when its tuesday at 4 when i wake up. I think i'll jump around and celebrate. The 3 days of retreat are going to be a lot of fun and i'll enjoy myself and lots of pictures will be taken i just wish i didnt have to work sunday and monday nights. Ok yep thats my update on my life."

"event","So i was supposed to hang out with James today. We specifically made plans. He asked me if i wanted to hang out with him last night and i said only if i would be able to still hang otu with him saturday. He agreed and made a joke about it being the 2 for 1 special. So i was looking forward to hanging out with him today. He gets online and tells me that his brother wants him to take him to an engine show today. So i said i guess i wouldnt be seeing him and he said that i'd see him tomorrow. I told him he was going fricken fishing with his brother and he said not until like 6 and he gets out of work at 11 or 12. As if that made up for him breaking his plans with me today. I dont know maybe i'm being a bitch. Probably am. But thats like one of my pet peeves is when people break their plans with me. I think tonight when he gets online or calls me i'm going to tell him that it obviously isnt important to him when he hangs out with me so it will no longer be important to me. I'm probably blowing this all out of proportion. Its not really a big deal that i'm not seeing him today its just that we made plans. Had we not made plans i'd have been fine with it. So yea that combined with the fact that my jeans zipper is being a bitch and the fact that i need a new ac adaptor cord again is making this one shitty day."

"event","So i'm pretty sure i've decided what birth control method to choose, of course that could all change when i get my exam and hear what the clinician recommends for me. However, i'm thinking strongly that i'll get the nuvaring which i have heard good things about. That'll also fit my lifestyle a lot better than the birth control pills because you have to remember monthly, not daily and like a lot of people said i should just set the alarm on my phone to go off when i need to replace the birth control. As to whether or not i'm going to the health department or planned parenthood i chose planned parenthood and will be going to the one in ann arbor. I'm hoping that i can get in there on a wednesday in the next few weeks because on wednesdays i work in adrian anyway and i'm therefore closer. Jayna is going to go with me when i go which is excellent. Its nice to have good friends. I'm actually kind of excited about this lol. I've been wanting to do this for a while and just havent had the courage or a big reason to do so. Now i have both so hopefully it all works out all right. I get to hang out with Jayna tonight which i'm really excited about. My boyfriends going to look at a house today at 4:30 and i'm hoping everything will go well with that. I know he really wants to get out of his parents house and away from his dad, so i'm praying that the house showing goes good and that the loan he wants to buy the house with gets approved. That boy is amazing. He reads me like no one has ever been able to before. He can look in my eyes and know how i'm feeling which sounds really corny but its true. Yesterday he wouldnt stop bothering me about if i was worrying about something and told me that he could see it in my eyes lol which is true i was worried about something but i lied and said i wasnt. That didnt really work too well lol. Oh well i got a lot of reassurance about how much he loves me and that our relationship is going to work so i guess its cool that he can read me like that lol. I probably wont see him until friday because he's going to the doctor tomorrow. He hasnt been feeling too well has a pretty bad cough and a lot of pressure on his chest. I have to work third shift on thursday which i am not looking forward to at all. Man i cant wait to call and make my appointment. They are open until 8 today, but i'm hoping my boss will head out for lunch and then i can make the phone call to make the appointment. Yay for being protected! Yay for seeing Jayna!! Woot!"

"event","So i have a big decision to make. I wish that i had closer friends that would be with me when i go to doctors or have appointments or have to make important decisions. I need that one friend that i can turn to when i need anything. I need to get on birth control and i cant tell my mom about it because she doesnt know that i'm having sex. I dont know what form to go on i dont think the pill would be good for me because i forget to take them. So i'm thinking either an  IUD or the shot. The shot is good for 3 months and the iud is good for 5-10 years as long as it doesnt fall out or anything. i guess it doesnt matter as long as it works and i can afford it. I dont know which would be cheaper going to planned parenthood or going to the health department. I dont have any insurance so that wont come into play, unless its cheaper at one because i dont. If you're a girl and are reading this and have any helpful suggestions or advice please comment. James said that he'd pay for whatever i couldnt cover which is really sweet of him its good to know that he supports me in whatever i do but i'd never take money from him. He went with me to a family picnic when i know he'd have rather gone with his parents to lansing. The boy is the biggest sweetheart i've ever met. He told me today that i meant the world to him and tells me he loves me everyday. I dont think i could do any better than what i have. I just hope that i dont fuck it up some how like i did the other relationships. I told him that and he said that i was putting it all on myself and i said it had to be my fault since they all dumped me and he said they were all idiots, including himself lol. But yea other than that not much going on. I get to see Jayna on wednesday :) that makes me happy. I love hanging out with friends woot!!"

"event","i think that my boyfriend is going to hate my guts tomorrow. Wednesday night we decided that he'd go to a picnic with me if he didnt have to work or if he got out of work early enough. He told me tonight that he didnt have to work but that his parents wanted him to go to lansing with them. He didnt know for what but he figured that they were going to go to their favorite restaurant. So he told me he didnt know which to do and then ended up choosing to go with the parents. So then my mom gets home and i tell  her that he's not going and she made plans based on the fact that he would be going. She got him a cabelas gift certificate for $50 for watching the house. so then she lays on a big guilt trip and then he feels obligated to go. I feel really bad for doing it to him, but i dont know we had those plans and then he just drops them the minute his family mentions going to lansing, i'm probably being selfish i dont know. But i really hate when people make plans with me and then break them. Its one of my pet peeves. So now i feel kind of bad and i hope that he isnt pissed at me tomorrow morning. i guess that mom will be doing massages tomorrow and dad and i are going to go to church. Thats weird i dont ever remember going to church with just dad. Oh well. I guess i just hope that everything turns out alright tomorrow and that i'm not hated all day."

Then when i went up to my room i found another note on my pillow from him. Lol he's such a sweet boyfriend. Basically the notes said that he loves me a lot and he's so glad that we're together and that we're going to have a wonderful life together in the future. I'm so lucky to have a guy like him. I can't wait to see him tonight. Hopefully i get to see him tonight, i was supposed to he said he had a lot to do and that he'd call me when he got it done. So hopefully he gets done soon and calls soon. If not it'd be because he got sent to a fire which means i'll have to wait and see him tomorrow. It would be a sad thing but i'd make it through it lol. He wants me to come over friday and spend the night with him because he doesnt have to work saturday so i'm going to have to work my mom into agreeing with that. Then sunday we have a family picnic that i'd really like him to go to. I said something about it on the phone the other day and he was funny he asked me if i was mentioning it because i wanted him to go and when i said it'd be nice if he went if he wanted to he told me to be stern and say ""james we have a family picnic to go to sunday and your going."" I thought that was rather comical. He's going to try his best to go sunday but he doesnt know when he'll be getting done with work and we have to leave at 11:45. He said he'd let me know by 11:30 lol thats really short notice but oh well. Then i was talking to him yesterday and he told me he found a house in town for 40,000 and that if he goes and looks at it he wants me to be there with him. Its nice to know that he wants me to be there and be a part of the big decisions in his life. Other than that nothing much is going on in my life right now. Goodbye livejournal friends"

I probably wont get to see him for the next 6 days. He's bailing hay late tonight and saturday i work 1st shift and his parents want him to go to dinner with him later that night. Then sunday i leave for vacation and i come back thursday. Mom wants him to house sit for us while we're on vacation. I think he might actually do it which would score him some major bonus points when it comes to my mom. Hopefully i'll be able to take some pictures while i'm on vacation and they will actually look good. In other good news, i'm losing weight again. I'm hoping i can keep losing it, but a little faster. I want to be skinny! lol. I dont think i've been skinny ever in my life so that would be something totally new and different. I was always a little on the chubby side, even as a little kid. Today is laundry day, which means i will be doing the laundry. I hate that chore. Oh well i like clean clothes so it'll have to be done. I really hope vacation isnt boring. I'm bringing a couple of books to read and gavin my brother and samantha my sister will both be there along with my aunt chris, uncle paul, aunt lisa, uncle terry and their 3 children. I wish the children werent coming because they are loud and like to scream a lot, but hopefully they'll be good for the majority of the trip. Okay thats all that is happening in my life.

I've already went two days without him a 3rd one and then leaving sunday for four days without him would suck major balls. So hopefully i see him tonight. And hopefully i see him tomorrow. Friday is supposed to be our day to hang out with each other. That's our designated day to go out and do something on a date. Hopefully he doesn't back down on something he started. Work went by quickly yesterday. It's amazing how much faster work goes at the university than it does when i'm working at the sheriffs department. I pretty much dread working at the sheriffs department. I don't think it would be so bad if i knew how to do everything that was asked of me. Once i figure out how to do all those things and can keep them in my mind then i should loathe working there less. I wonder whose house james or i will be going to. It's actually james's turn to come over to my house. If he does i'm pretty sure my mother will ask him to take care of the pets while we are gone and i dont want her to ask that of him. Thats a lot of work on top of the work he does too much of right now. Hopefully he'll be comfortable enough with saying no to her. I'm going to try and forewarn the poor guy. I almost wish that i'd have to go over there. We never get very much alone time when we're at my house because my parents are really strict on having him in my bedroom or whatever. His parents definitely are not strict with that. But that's pretty much all that is going on today me sitting  around waiting for james to get out of work so i can have fun. Goodbye livejournal friends :)"

"event","Well today has been an okay day so far. Things are a lot better with my mom and i. She's actually saying i love you again and was really nice to me yesterday so i'm glad for that. I didn't get to see my boyfriend yesterday so i'm hoping that i will get to tonight. I can't remember a time so far that we've gone 2 days without seeing each other so hopefully i'll see him. He was feeling kind of sick last night but he told me he'd be fine by morning that it was just his stomach acting up as it does sometimes from the accident he got in two years ago. He tore his intestines in 3 places, poor guy. Saturday i have to work day shift dispatch and sunday i'm leaving for holland michigan for four days of vacation. I'm going to miss james and all my friends a bunch. Aww man i wont be back until thursday and i made a date with Jayna for wednesday, i'm so stupid. I wonder if i could work next friday instead of on wednesday at the school and then i could hang out with jayna after that...hmmm this is getting complicated lol. Maybe i can just catch a ride up with danielle sometime and blah! lol i dont know. I miss being at college and being to hang out with my friends whenever. But when i go back i wont be able to see my boyfriend whenever. Blah such a sucky situation. Hopefully i'll get to see him on the weekends. If not i'll probably die. I'm hoping that when i go to holland one of the days we'll go to muskegon and go to michigans adventure. I really love their water slides. But yup thats pretty much everything going on in my life"

Ok hopefully this works, if it does this is my boyfriend i cut myself out because i look like crap. I really didn't have a good day. I pretty much cried all morning for only one particular reason that has gotten progressively worse. My mother is pissed off at me. She seems to think that i don't appreciate her enough. 3 days ago she asked me to run some errands which i was fine with doing. However she thinks that i was stomping through the house and being bitchy so for the past 3 days she's been mean to me. I'm glad my boyfriend came over for 3 hours, but i'm sad i didnt call him like i thought about doing when my parents were gone for the 3 hours before hand. Blah sometimes i'm so stupid. Other than that life is pretty much the same. Danielle and her friend Brad who will be attending siena this fall came over to visit. We played a game of cranium my brother and i against her and brad and they beat us by like one. It was crazy. Then gavin killed all of us in halo which i'm pretty sure he thoroughly enjoyed. That was pretty much my day. Hopefully things will get better between my mother and i, i'm praying that they will."

"event","Well good news! I busted two people for selling me liquor. Ha the sheriffs department seriously frowns on selling alcohol to minors. That was the most fun i've ever had at work. I wonder if i'll get to hang out with anyone tonight, if not i guess i could watch some house and keep myself entertained. Man there is so many things i want to do with my boyfriend. I want to go to a romantic dinner, i want to go to the beach, i want to go out and do things just the two of us, i guess i'll have to start suggesting that. He said yesterday that he wants a set day where we go out and do something. Do stuff during the week but have that one day set aside to do something fun with each other, i really like the idea. Maybe we could make it so that we each pick something once a week, like he picks something to do and we do it then the next week its my turn to pick, seems only fair to me. I love compromises. But yea i'm hungry and hyper so i must do something! Goodbye"

He tells me to shut up when i talk like that lol. I forgot to take a picture, i really wanted to remember so i could have a picture of the two of us. We'll probably end up hanging out on sunday so hopefully i'll remember to take one of us then. I wonder if i still have our prom pictures that were taken together, probably not since it was a long time ago. Oh well thats on my list of things to do: Get a picture of Xanthia and James together. :) Goodnight everyone"

"event","So i really want to hang out with my boyfriend tonight and i really hope i get to. It's insane how much i already miss him and i've only not seen him in a day. I should be able to see him after he gets out of work, but hmm maybe he wont want to see me. I hope that isnt the case. I went through my msn archive with him last night. Man i was the biggest bitch in the world to him, i can't imagine why he didn't give up on me. He must really love me. I think he does. He broke up with me in the summer of 04, i said something about married a hypothetical situation he didn't take it that way he was 17 and freaked out. He also liked another girl, very flirty never would have dated him. Took him a year to realize the huge mistake he made. From That point on he tried to get back together with me. I finally gave in about two weeks ago and started dating him. When we went to mackinac with his family i realized i do still love him and when he asked me saturday to be his girlfriend i said yes. Now i hope to god that it works out. We've already talked about marriage, houses, kids and he initiated all the conversations. He talked about getting me a promise ring for christmas or my birthday. So yea i really hope it works out between him and i. If i dont get to see him today i guess i'll see him sunday. Sunday is pretty much our day together. Saturday i'm working from 12-6 pm. We're doing alcohol busts so i'll be spending 6 hours trying to buy some beer. Wooo fun! But yea i need to take a shower and then i'll be watching the first season of house on dvd then i'm hoping when he gets out of work he'll get online and say he wants to hang out, hopefully here but i dont care where just as long as i'm with him. But yep thats my update. hope everyones having a lovely day."

"event","Happy Fourth of July Everyone! Today my family is having a cookout. I really wanted my boyfriend to go with me, but seems how he spent the last 4 days with me i doubted he wanted to go. Good thing my mother has a big mouth and asked him about it. It's nice to actually have a boyfriend that likes spending time with me as much as i like spending time with him. So around 1 i'll be heading down with my mom, james, my brother and his girlfriend to monroe for the family cookout. I really hope its a nice day if its not it'll be a good thing they have a big house. Man i can't remember being this happy in a while. I really wish i hadn't been such a stubborn jackass and just dated him when he asked me like a year ago. Oh well, everyone makes mistakes its part of being human right? Well i better get some breakfast and do a load of laundry. Happy Independence day everyone!

 This weekend was a lot of fun 

Well the weekend went really well. I really enjoyed the trip, but that mainly had to deal with enjoying the time with james. The first day we went to the island and walked the 7 miles it takes to see it. If i ever go there again i'm renting a freaking bike lol. The hotel we stayed at was pretty nice it had a nice big shower and a pool and free breakfast but i didnt use the last two. The second day we were there we went to tequamanon or however you spell it falls. lol. It was kind of pretty but not worth the 200 or so stairs. this trip was full of walking and stairs, i lost weight thats for damn sure. James' family was really nice, his brother is 16 and relatively funny and i get along with him fine. His dad is a little difficult to take at first but you learn and then learn to ignore him. His mom likes me a lot and i like her a lot so i'm good to go there. We also went to the soo locks and went mini golfing. I beat james, but he cheated on a few and said he got 5's when he got 6's so we both ended up with 64's lol. But yea it was a lot of fun and i'm really glad i went. Oh yea I'M NOT SINGLE ANYMORE!!! WOOT! :) it feels so great to finally have someone have feelings for me and me for them. I just hope that this time it works out.

 Happy 
Current mood:  happy 
 I'm leaving my house around 8:30 tomorrow night. I will then be waking up at 4:00 the next morning to head off to mackinaw city, st. ignace, and the island. This should be a wonderful experience for me since i've never really been to the Upper Peninsula. That and the fact that i'm going with the guy i'm dating...not bf and gf just dating and we get to stay in a hotel room just the two of us really fun. It'll also give me a chance to bond with his family which is always a good thing. So thats what i'm doing this weekend. My fourth of july plans are to go to a family cookout where i will get to see my crazy family on my moms side including my favorite aunt in the whole world and my cousin Hayley. I'm looking forward to that. I love my family. I love my life right now. 


 
 
drive in madness 
Current mood:  happy 


So the drive in was kind of nice, we were able to see the screen perfectly and the nice thing was that we could turn the volume up to the volume we preferred, which i really like the movie theaters usually have the volume up too loud. Another thing i enjoyed was the total lack of candy papers rattling or people kicking my seat. Loved that. The only downfall was that a couple of mosquitoes were in the truck attempting to eat us alive. Click was a really good movie it made me cry twice, which i hate doing but it shows that it appealed to the emotions. Anyway i'd recommend that movie to anyone who was thinking about going to see it, but dont think its a comedy when you go because really it isnt. The next movie on the screen was RV. By the time this movie came alone i was already tired since i had gotten up at 8:30 to go work. I think we saw about a half hour of that movie and to be totally honest it blew. I expected more from a movie with robin williams in it, i  guess i can forgive him and blame it on him getting old. Dating my ex boyfriend is turning out a lot better than what i thought it was going to. He isnt annoying at all and he's very considerate and fun to be with, which its pretty much damn hard to find a guy who isnt too clingy who doesnt call you every day who wants to date you but realizes you have a life outside of when you two are together. That could be due to the fact that we arent bf and gf but in an open relationship instead. Whichever is the case i like it a lot and i think i'm back on the road to being a happy person"

"event","Figured since i haven't written in this for months i'd better update. Life is pretty good. I miss all of my friends from siena, especially my sorority sisters. However it is good to be at home and be able to relax without the stress of upcoming papers or having an insane amount of homework to do, but that will be back soon. I started dating my ex bf around a week ago. Just dating not bf and gf i dont want to get serious for a long time, i'm really liking having the freedom to go where i wanna go and do what i wanna do without having to answer to any man. Tonight i'll be hanging out with my ex roommate kelly. My future roommate meghan is no longer my future roommate, so if anyone is looking to share a suite with someone then mine is open. Sunday i'll be going to the movie rv and click at the capri drive in in coldwater with my ex. It should be kind of fun, at least it gives me something to look forward to after work gets out. Well hmm i think thats pretty much all for now. Goodbye livejournal friends"

"event","So its new years eve and i'm slowly being tortured. My cousins are here and one of them who loves to sing is singing in a karaoke machine. She's really not that good, however she seems to think her voice is the most wonderful thing that she could delight the world to hear. I pretty much become anti social when all of my family are around unless my aunt amy and my cousin hayley are there and they didnt make it tonight, they have the flu so they stayed home, which is understandable. The men are in the living room watching football of course, their favorite past time and of course they have a few beers in their hands. i should have gone somewhere other than here. i'd like to kill my aunt for bringing this stupid machine in my house. I wish we would just play games and then people would leave. I dunno maybe i'm a bitch. I have to work on the 3rd midnight shift, should be lots of fun. Then on the 7th i have to do eboard retreat which wont be any fun probably but it will be nice to see my sisters again. I just resent the long ass drive to grass lake. but yea my new years eve sucks, hope yours is better."

"event","Alright, i have one class done and over with four more to go. I have one more big project due in my education class along with two assignments and of course answering the common question. In history i think the final is going to be pretty rough, he's talking about putting stuff in chronological order and stuff like that. That is not my forte. English should be relatively simple. I pretty much have a b in that class no matter what. If you're wondering why i'm up so early it's because i have to do 8 hours of observation at onsted middle, and high school today. I'm really not looking forward to it but will be happy when it's done and over with. My exam for humanities is going to be easy, maybe even possibly fun. I lost my room key, which we have to turn in on the 15th or pay 75 dollars for which is really shitty because right now i have a lot of financial obligations. I do get paid thursday at work so i'll be able to pay it its just a mattter of not being able to buy christmas presents for everyone which really sucks. Then i have to start saving up money for my sorority. I swear its insane i get money and then it's automatically out of my hands. Kelly will be moving in with me very soon, i dont know how that is going to work out, i'm hoping it goes well but who knows. I really enjoyed not having a roommate this first semester. I have a lot of fun things planned for over break and a little before break. On the 7th it's my mom and dad's 25th anniversary which we are going to do a murder mystery dinner for that dad doesnt know about. Mom's really sneaky like that. like  25 of my family members will be there. Then there is the department christmas pary and i thnk thats on the 17th much good food will be had. on the 4th i get positions for the sorority, not really looking forward to that one but at the same time i am. on the 10th i'm getting my christmas tree with the family and on the 11th i'll be decorating it. I'm so excited this semester is almost over. It has been one from hell. Anyways time to go shower. Tata for now."

"event","Well now, what have we been doing? i've been busy with school that is for sure. the sorority is going pretty well, though our exam is either the 30th or november 3rd so it is coming up and i really need to study. Kelly and i are studying from 2-5 today. Then i suppose i have all of friday and saturday to study. The handcuff party is coming up, which for those of you in a sorority or a fraternity will know about, it's going to be exciting. The theme this year is halo's, horns, and handcuffs. One side of the room will be decorated to look like hell and the other obviously will look like heaven, it is going to be fantastic. Anyway yes i have to go shopping friday for a dress and we get paid tomorrow so that is perfect timing, i will be tearing it up at the mall....maybe i'll even see some of you there. If we can't find anything around adrian perhaps we'll go to jackson, i'm sure i'll find something its not like it has to be a prom dress, if it did have to be i'd be all set but nope its homecoming dress style. Here we call it a semi-formal. I'm so excited, can you guys tell? I havent been to the mall shopping for fun stuff in a while. I have to remember to get a slip and probably a white shirt while i'm shopping for initiation. I have to wear my whites on initiation. I kinda like when all the girls dress in their whites they really do look pretty. Halloween is coming up. Last night i gave tours with jayna around the haunted places at school, that was kind of ridiculously boring and stupid. I'm sure those places would be scary with one person there, however with the huge group of people we had it wasnt. I really need to work on my change over time poster for history. I printed off pictures for it yesterday and made them all pretty, now i just need to come up with a thesis about it and write a paper on it. Its only going to have to be like 1 1/2 pages single spaced so it shouldnt be too horribly awful. Lets see anything else i want to say? I miss my cat."

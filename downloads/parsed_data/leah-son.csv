"event","ok. i just need to get this off my chest because its been bugging me and i think its why i cant sleep tonight. 
why should i really care about all of this anyway? she wasnt a good friend to me and she made my life miserable most of the time. why should i really care if she wants to work this out or not. i think my life would be a lot better off without her and she can go and make new friends and be mean to them and treat them like shit like she treats everybody else that she knows and doesnt know. im going to start from where it happend to where it is now. it was the day after the electricity went out and we were all down stairs sitting on the couch. jenny put her arm on my arm and for some reason it hurt really bad. i dont think that i handled the situation that great but i was pissed and i told jenny to move her arm and i probably had an attitude in my voice which probably got her pissed. then she did it again and reached over and i moved her hand off of my arm and she just got really pissed and wouldnt talk to me. i was in a weird mood that day anyway so it probably didnt help the situation. so because jenny was mad at me i got mad at her and i didnt want to talk the rest of the day. so the next day i was still upset because of what happend. but i dont think that what happend that day was the real reason why i was so pissed. it was probably because of what happend last summer. and i didnt apologize to jenny and she didnt apologize to me. so we just started talking again and things got better and we became friends again. but i know now that it is hard to build on a relationship that had a problem in it but never got fixed. it just got worse because here we are agian mad at each other for no real reason and fighting.but this time cassie, kate and i want to work it out. this is the most mature way we have ever handled a problem like this and jenny does not want to coroperate. we wanted to sit down and take turns and talk to each other about our problems so that we could work on them and our friendship would be better. thats never going to happen because jenny thinks that she does nothing wrong and that me and cassie are accusing her of being mean to us. she says she has nothing to say to us. if she thinks she has done nothing wrong then why is she so scared to face us and tell us that? why does she not want to try to fix the problem? because she knows she did something wrong or she really is that dumb and thinks she is the best person in the world, the nicest one and that she is such an east target for people to pick on. she is WRONG. she is the worst person i have ever met in my life. she has problems and i dont mean that in a bad way, i mean that she needs professional help to work out her problems. its so hard to talk to someone like jenny because its like talking to a brick wall. your just talking to yourself. nothing you say she wants to hear because if she doesnt want to hear it, she wont listen. if its not what she wants to hear, she wont listen. kate tried talking to her to try to get her to sit down with everyone and talk but jenny got defensive and started saying that she didnt do anything, she didnt do anything to be treated like this. blah blah blah. shit. jenny said that we are being IMMATURE about this. how is talking and expressing how you feel so you can have a better friendship and make things work immature? i dont see how it is. unless youre going to sit down and yell and scream at each other. but were not. when kate was talking to jenny, she started to bring up my friend jenna. the only reason is because she is jealous. jenna moved away a year ago. she was a really good friend and still is a really good friend. a better friend than jenny EVER was to me. but whenever it was me, jenny and jenna. jenny was so nice to jenny and left me out and tried to make me feel bad. but when jenna wasnt around she talked bad about her. she hated jenna but she didnt act like it around her because she had to make me feel bad for having a friend other than her. last summer i went away for a week with jenna to the beach. i had the best time of my life. apparently i found out today that jenny was really pissed because i went to the beach with someone else. i went away from her. why did she have to be like that. so when i got back from the beach i told her how i felt about her being exactly like me. copying almost everything about me. it had bugged me for a long time but i had never said anything and finally i did. but thats another story. 
one of the main reasons why i wanted to talk to jenny and work things out was because kate and jenny are still friends(i think) and it would be weird and not fair to anyone if kate had to hang out with jenny one day and me and cassie the next. but since jenny is not willing to talk to us in person then i dont really want to waste my time on this. its not that important to me because everything with her is getting old and tyiring. but then it is kind of important because its hard losing a friend that youve had for 6 years. i would really like to talk things out even if we just stopped being friends because stuff like this makes me want to scream and throw up. all this stuff i keep bottled up inside me and i hate this feeling. feeling like your going to explode. its so FRUSTRATING because you cant get anything through to jenny. NOTHING. she doesnt understand anybody but herself. and i dont even know if she understands herself. because if she did then she would probably know the pain she puts on other people and how she makes people feel. why does jenny hangout with people she doesnt even like? is it because she wants us to see her with friends? does she want us to see her having fun without us? does she want us to see that she doesnt care about us? does she want us to be mad and jealous? well if she does, its not working because i know shes just doing it to get back at us. i dont even know how long this will last. util the end of the summer? then when school starts she wont have any friends and come back to us? maybe not. i just wish that we could talk to her. but we cant because its jenny, its the way she is. she will never change. this is from along time ago but this is what she wrote, ""Hm you know what I really hate High School Petty drama. I cannot wait to get out of high school..."" its not the same thing thats happening now but it kind of is. if she thinks that all this shit will stop happening when she gets out of highschool, then she is wrong. most of the time she is the one making these stupid problems for herself. if she wasnt like this, if she thought about other people instead of herself all the time, shit like this wouldnt happen. so jenny, if you think your life is going to get better after highschool, keep wishing. i dont want to sound mean but she is probably going to have these problems all through her life. i mean i dont wish that she has problems. i hope that she has a good life and things get better for her and all of us. why is this whole thing so complicated. why cant we just sit down and talk to jenny and work things out. personally, i think that jenny doesnt even have a real reason to be mad at us right now except for the fact that we are mad at her. me and cassie havent talked to her about anything and she is mad at us.wtf man. it just makes me soo mad. i could go on and on and on forever, just like an aim conversation with jenny. it never ends and never gets anywhere because she is the most stubborn person i know and she is like a brick wall. but i will stop here. this probably didnt make any sence but i just needed to get it all out and i feel a little better but not a lot. i just wish that we could all talk to each other. but at the same time i dont feel like wasting my time on a friendship that isnt good for me. this friendship with jenny isnt good for my friendship with anyone. mrs. maria asked me what would be so bad about loosing jenny as a friend? nothing. 

p.s. i dont care if i spelt anything wrong and its not like anybody is going to read it"

"event","~Yesterday I came home from school and was just sitting on my couch, then i started to get like a stomach cramp and so i got up to get some ibuprofen and i could barely walk and it hurt really bad. Then my mom came upstairs and i was like freaking out cause my stomack hurt, and i quess she didnt believe me cause she was like ""well take some medicine and come help me move some furniture downstairs"".And i was like ""i cant walk!""It took me a while to convince her that my stomach really did hurt and she let me lay down. So i sat down on the couch and this really sharp pain hit the left side of my stomach and it felt like someone took a HUGE, SHARP knife and stabbed me really really really hard and was like cutting and ripping the insides of my stomach.It hurt to breath,  and i was like hypervenalating, and it hurt to cry. So then it got really bad and i couldnt move anything on my body so i started crying and it hurt when i cried. It felt like i was having a freaking baby cause it felt like contraptions!So then my mom called the docotors,scheduled and appointment(i cant spell)for 7.
But i could not get up because it hurt soo bad. So i started to think that i was going to die and that i was going to have to get surgery and my mom started to get mad at me cause i was overreacting.So then she was telling me that if i couldnt get up that she was going to have to call the hospital and have an ambulance pick me up.So finally she gave me more ibuprofen and 45mins later the pain stopped.
 So i didnt go to school today cause i felt like i was going to throw up and i didnt want the pains to come back at school. I went to the doctors and she said that I probably have a stomach virus but i could possibly have a kidney infection or stone.
 And thanks to all this i didnt have time to work on my english project which is due tomorrow and its not fair cause everybody else gets more weeks to do it.GO TO BLOODFIAH MS.FIERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FUCKING E!!!

I was the 1st person to jump off the tree!I almost did a 360 then i flew backwards into the luscious pile of leaves.lol.I think i landed wrong because now my leg all the way up to my butt hurts and i can bairly walk up the stairs.but it was fun.*Good Stuff son*

  Then we got to the appartment and it was really creepy cause the guy that owned the place looked like her was gunna rape us.So then we went down to the boardwalk and meet up with my aunt and uncles and cousins.Then me and Ashley and Sarah went down to rife some rides.Sarah started barking at people so me and Ashley tied her up in her jacket and when we were going to meet up with my mom we saw the guys in the car.The driver(the hot one)was Ray.We finally got back at 12.
  The next morning we got up and got ready and my mom went out to go swimming in the race she was in.Me, Ashley and Sarah went to ride rides and me and Ashley went on the Zipper 3millon times.Then we went to the arkade and we went crazy!We spent like all our money on this 1 game trying to get a minnie cell phone.We wernt supposed to play the game cause you had to be 18, but we did it anyway and we broke the machine.We got like 20 things from there and the staff workers came by and we ran.So then we came back an hour later and got pictures taken at the arkade.OMG!!!We got picture stickers and then we did these pictures where you pick a body and put your head on it.And Sarah got her head on a Tarzan body and OMG!!It is sooooo funny!!!!Me and Ashley laughed for a freakin hour!!And we still laugh!I got my picture on a cave man body and Ashley got hers on a womans body.So then we went up to where my aunt and uncle where staying and we sat on the beach for a little while then we went to some building and rode the elavator up to the 19th floor and the veiw was SEXY!!!!Then we went back down to the beach and i got changed into my bathing suit right on the beach.Then we went into the water and it was a pinkish color because of the sunset.It was reallly pretty.Then we left and we were drivign dwn the road with the music up really loud and we were screaming at people.Then we turned on Bob Marley really loud and these prissy frofro people were getting all mad.But then we met some people and they were like, ""turn it up!!.""So then we went into Ripleys and got on that thing that spins around for hours and we met some kid and he was like, ""this doesnt make me dizzy cause im a skater boy.""But then he became our friend because he followed us and his name was Taylin.Then we were about to leave and we decided to go back and go on the sinny thing.So we went back and he was like, ""what if someone catchesus?"" and i was like, ""were looking for my ring.""Then he was like where do you live and then he ran away cause ""he couldn't handle this!""So then we came out and my mom gave us some bouncy balls that light up.We went into the sunfest tent and got soem food then we were sitting on the benches and sarah went up to this guy with a dinosaur puppet and touched it.Then the guy was like, ""let me show you how he works.""and he made sarah sit on the ground and he made the dinosaur jump at her and she screamed.Then my mom went to give him a tip and he was like making the dinosaur rub up against our legs.He was hitting on us through his puppet.Then we went and rode some rides again.Then we went back to the place and me and Ashley were sitting on the deck and hanging our legs over and pretending to sleep and this woman stopped and started pointing and laughing.It was soo funny.Then we saw soem guy putting a cooler in the trash can and we thought there was a dead body in it.And there was this guy flashing his lights at us and waving in his car and he was there for like a hour.
  The next day we got packed up and rented the tandems things at Mikes Bikes.Me and Ashely kept crashing into each other and  ran into sarahs bike and i think i broke the chain.Then we went swimming for an hour and there was this guy with his butt hanging out of his pants.He wouldn't pull them up!So we got out of the water and went to the little playground things and we decided to make up a new language nad we call it Franish.So we were talking to each other in that language and little kids were staring at us and we were yelling at them.Then we left and we called our friends and made some new ones because of Ashleys pictures.We put them on the car window and all these men were staring at them.So then we made a sign that said ""HONK IF YOU THINK PICTURES ARE SEXY.""We only got 2 people to honk cause we put the sign up to late.Then we got home.Man that was a lot to write!!!"

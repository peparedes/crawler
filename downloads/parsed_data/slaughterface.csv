"event","It's been goin' on for a while now... I must say I'm really quite good at it, too.  ""It"" being the fine art of providing devoted and loyal support and love to those who need it: the romantically crushed, the socially alienated, or the chronically depressed.
I have no problem with doing this, and I don't really expect much in return.  HOWEVER, I do expect one thing.  I expect that once I'm no longer absolutely needed, that I am not to be thrown away like a pair of crutches that have out-lived their utility.  My affections are sincere and my concern is genuine; it kills me to be completely shit on after really fostering a bond with someone.  I can't take being ignored after you get with that special someone, or being slowly excluded after I introduce you to my own closest friends, or being patronized after you're no longer depressed.  I'm done with it.  Completely.
So next time you need a shoulder on which you can cry, a friend on whom you can call, or a warm body with which you can share a bed, CALL SOMEBODY ELSE.  I'll have nothing to do with it.  That ship has sailed.
Thank you.  Goodnight.  And as always, go fuck yourself."

I'm just sick of watching people for whom I have some semblance of respect make complete asses of themselves.  I'm sick of having my free time (what tiny amount of it there is, at least) wasted at parties populated with morons.  Maybe this kind of shit works for some of you, but it doesn't for me.  It kind of makes me sick to my stomach...

So, when I look detached: 
No, I'm not upset.
No, I'm not being weird.
No, I'm not ""down-trodden""

I just want nothing to do with the people around me.  
Well, maybe that's too strong...  I want nothing to do with the games people play nor the transparent acts they put up nor the spineless interactions, etc.

Fuck, I guess an abundance of regrets has aged me beyond my years, and I'm subsequently bitter, judgmental and crotchety....  Either that or YOU ARE ALL ACTING LIKE IDIOTS AND IT MAKES ME FUCKING ASHAMED TO KNOW YOU.
Unfortunately, it needs to be said.

Eat my shit and die.

"event","If there is one thing with which I don't want to deal, it's more anxiety attacks.
Last night, my brain turned to mush- a consequence of my complete inability to control my emotions and to accept facts while I am drunk.  
On the other hand, all of this would be a non-issue if people were just upfront.  (Myself especially)

So, in conclusion, we all eat shit, but sleep cures all."

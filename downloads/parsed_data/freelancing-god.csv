* freelancing since june last year, things are going well. not running out of work, that's for sure.
* attended <a href=""http://www.railscamp08.org"">railscamp</a> #1 outside of Sydney in June last year. it. was. awesome.   50 geeks, no internet, lots of chatter, coding, eating, drinking, relaxing and playing guitar hero and wii.
* ran railscamp #2 in november last year. just as awesome, and we got to celebrate the election.
* heading round the world overseas for four months from the 24th of may. US (Portland, Seattle, New York, Boston, maybe Washington), Canada (Vancouver, Toronto, maybe Calgary, Montreal), UK (London, Edinburgh, Birmingham - for the UK Discworld Con, Cambridge), Germany (Berlin), Turkey (Istanbul), Cambodia (Battambang, Siem Reap, probably Phnom Penh) via Singapore somehow.
* nullus #2 is happening in feb next year
* pondering organising a UK railscamp.
* blogging regularly at http://freelancing-gods.com - and it's not <em>all</em> technical posts
* go visit http://www.pangeaday.org - it's such an awesome idea
* twittering - http://twitter.com/pat
* have applied to talk at RailsConf EU (the visit to Berlin) - won't find out for a while if I get my talk accepted though
* Oh, and I have a beard.

sorry for my silence. feel free to bug me in comments if you wish."

"event","Ok, time for a public service announcement and favour-asking.

As most/all of you on my friends-list know, I'm running <a href=""http://www.ausdwcon.org"">Nullus Anxietas</a>, the Australian Discworld Convention, which is happening from the 9th to 11th of February next year. We've got Terry Pratchett coming over for it, and we'll have Stephen Briggs, Bernard Pearson and Colin Smythe available over the internet for video interviews, as well as plenty of other fun stuff happening.

The reason I'm bringing this up now is because the membership rates are going up at the end of the month - so if you're interested in coming along, now is a good time to pay up.

Also, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could post something to your LJ (like <lj user=""yobbbo""> so wonderfully did <a href=""http://yobbbo.livejournal.com/86445.html"">a few weeks ago</a>), so people who aren't on my friends list are a bit more aware of the price rise and the event. Feel free to direct people to this post, or the website, and I'm more than happy to answer questions people have.

Keep in mind, if you want the current rates but can't afford to pay the entire cost right now, you can sign up for a supporting membership ($25), and that'll mean you can sign up at any point and pay the rates that were current when you got the supporting membership. <strong>BUT</strong>, if you can afford it, please buy a full membership now. More money for us is helpful for things like Venue deposits and Terry's airfare.

Oh, one more thing... if you sign up for a full/concession membership (ie. not a supporting one) before the end of the month, you go into the draw for our competition, where the ten winners get to have coffee and a chat with Terry at some point during the convention."

"event","<p><lj user=""yobbbo""> very kindly posted an entry yesterday on his lj about <a href=""http://www.ausdwcon.org"">Nullus Anxietas</a>, which prompted a bit of discussion - and a lot of it was how it's too expensive.</p>

<p>Obviously, I'm biased, but I just want to point out that it isn't 'expensive' - the price ($160/$140 Concession) is quite normal compared to other such events.</p>
<ul>
<li>The UK Discworld Convention costs something along the line of 60 pounds (I can't confirm, as they've taken prices off their website now that the event is over), which is $150 AUD.</li>
<li>Continuum, which happened in August in Melbourne, was $145 in the months leading up to it, then was $175 at the door.</li>
<li>Conflux 4 (happening in Canberra next year) is $190 in the last few months leading up to the event, then $220 at the door.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in why we have to charge so much (and trust me, if we make a profit, it will be a very very nice surprise - Conventions finish in the red more often than not), here's one of our main costs - Terry's airfare. A flexible business class flight is a bit over $14,000. You could argue he should fly economy - but for health reasons, he actually has to fly first class (and he's covering the upgrade), and as a rule of thumb, Guests of Honour for conventions get business class flights.</p>

<p>Insurance is also a major factor these days - prices are much higher than they were before 9-11.</p>

<p>Just to compare another factor - the UK Convention has very little in the way of venue costs (they're in the middle of nowhere, and so the vast majority of people stay at the hotel, which gives them quite a bit of bargaining power), and their guest costs are dramatically reduced, as all are based in the UK, so flights don't really come into the picture. They also have a geographical advantage - there's a lot more Discworld fans a lot closer to their event.</p>

<p>Conventions don't like charging this much - trust me, we've made every attempt to keep it as cheap as possible - but we also need to break even. I just want to raise awareness that what we're doing isn't expensive, it's just more than first-time convention attendees expect.</p>

<p>I'd welcome comments about any of this...</p>"

"event","<div style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt"">Ok guys, I need to borrow your collective social networks - I'm looking for people to fit two roles: print designer, and web designer. Although, quite happy to have one person who can do both.

I know some of you on my friends list fit those roles, and hey, if you fit the criteria I'm going to list, then let me know.

I need these people for the Convention, to design and create graphics and such for any printed documents and/or web sites. The emphasis is on professional work - I won't be accepting even the most hard-core discworld nut if I don't think they're going to produce the level of work I'm looking for - so I want to see a portfolio of some sort - even if it's a bunch of links pointing to sites you've done.

To make things a little harder, I'd also prefer the work to be done for free. Yes, I know that's a hell of a lot less tempting, but we're a not-for-profit group, and frankly we can't afford to pay people for design. You don't have to be a Discworld fan, though, but I'd imagine most people who might be interested are probably going to like the books anyways.

Now, I'm not expecting this to apply to many people on my friends list - but if anyone knows someone who might fit the bill, I'd massively appreciate you seeing if they'd be interested, or passing me on an email address or url. Also, if any other committee members or other interested parties could link to this post, that'd be awesome.

Just to clarify one thing: the web design will be purely design, not back end code. That said, if you want to code as well, I'm not going to complain - makes life easier for <lj user=""hyperevade""> and myself.

Thanks everyone.<br />&nbsp;</div>"

I have played some Crowded House today, but it does not help my mood.

For something completely different to the above paragraph, I saw Quidam on Thursday afternoon with the family, and it was amazingly awesome. Fun, breath-taking, wonderful music... I know its expensive, but I definitely think its worth it. Cirque Du Soleil are masters of their craft. Screw the traditional circus (which never appealed to me anyways), this is much better.

Also seen was a comedy show on Friday with <lj user=""yobbbo""> while he temporarily escaped the clutches of Canberra, another on Sunday with my younger brother, and yet another tonight, all by myself. I had organised a group of work peoples to see Danny Bhoy, but unfortunately had two more people confirm after I bought the initial round of tickets. It's general admin (no set seats), so I went to pick up two more on Friday, and found it was sold out. Which made me rather pissed off. Well, extremely pissed off. 

Anyways, one of the people was quite happy not to come, and I had already given my ticket to the other to give myself incentive to get more tickets asap. I'm seeing Danny Bhoy next week anyways, so it made sense for me to be the one missing out tonight (albeit that I organised the night), and I tried to find someone with an extra ticket, but no luck. I did find a free ticket for a quite average show that was on around the same time, so I saw that instead, then went out for a drink with a couple of those who went to the work show.

Leaving for Tasmania on Thursday night next week, getting back on the Friday of the following week. Should be fun - although first family holiday in quite some time, so will be interesting to see how we all get along.

Oh, and work is busy.

That's enough of an update for the moment.<br />&nbsp;</div>"

And I'm stuck at work at 7pm, waiting for a blasted cube (multi-dimensional database) to compile. Took an hour last run, after some small tweaks it should be less than that this time. Hopefully. But yeah, plenty of time to aimlessly surf the net instead of being productive on various things.

Anyways, welcome to <lj user=""blithespirit"">, <lj user=""arienmir""> and <lj user=""designadrug"">. I've no idea how long some of you have had me on your friends lists, as I generally read LJ via <a href=""http://www.bloglines.com"">bloglines</a> - with the occasional browse of the friends page for friends-only posts. Which I'm waaaaay behind on at the moment. Does anyone know a way to get friends-only posts on RSS, perhaps through HTTP Authentication?

Super quick update: Work = stressful, Con = a bit stressful, Social Life = surprisingly busy, World of Warcraft = not played enough (or perhaps I'm playing too much as it is). Graduated last week on Wednesday, so that brings a nice feeling of closure to uni, most likely for good. Comedy Festival is almost upon us again, so that should keep the social life kicking. Going to see Cirque Du Soleil's Quidam with the family in two weeks, so looking forward to that (although I miss a staff development afternoon here at work, and they're usually good fun)... Gods, I'm complaining about missing work. Would like to be seeing Ben Folds in early April, but yet to find someone who wants to come and is free on the 6th - so if you do like Ben Folds, and will be in Melbourne on the 6th, please let me know. And after that, there's most likely a trip to Tasmania with the family - altho I'm hesitant to whether the Spirit of Tasmania will already be booked, so it could be postponed yet again (was going to happen in December last year).

That'll do for the moment.

So much to cover, so I'll split it up over a few posts (of varying security levels)...

In no particular order

I got a <a href=""http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=au&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=PHP1_10140&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10140"" title=""Sony Ericsson S700i"">new phone</a> yesterday :D - its on a 24 month plan, which isn't good, but its a damn good phone, so that makes up for it. The reason for getting it is because my old phone decided to only respond to about 1 in 100 key presses (so I'd be lucky to start it up, let alone key my pin in, and there's probably a few sms's on there I wasn't able to read).

I moved out of my place in Abbotsford on the weekend before Christmas, then found a new place on Tuesday, so started moving stuff in the Monday after Christmas. I'm still at my folks at the moment (which is where I've resided since leaving Abbotsford), but I'll prob get everything in my room sorted over the next few days and be in by the start of next week. We've only had the power and phone on since today, and gas isn't officially on until next Wednesday, but it works. My brother is spending his first night there tonight. Yes, for those who didn't know, I'm moving out with my brother. It shall be interesting (as I've said many a time, since I'm using that as my default statement).

Oh, and since it doesn't look like I've mentioned it before on here, the reason I moved out of the Abbotsford place was because one housemate was only planning to stay for a few months, and <lj user=""yobbbo""> is going to Canberra for a year (he chooses to go to Canberra - something ain't right in his head ;). So I ran out of housemates, and about the only person I could find that was interested was my middle brother. The one who is not at all like me.

To jump to another topic completely, I passed all my uni subjects. Granted, the group project mark wasn't nearly as high as I was expecting, but it doesn't matter all that much - except one of our group members failed, and now I've got both him and his father asking me to somehow convince the subject convener to pass him.

Christmas day was spent with the family, nice and relaxed, which is the usual, and its much preferred to going out and visiting relatives like some people do. Tonight was even more quiet, since it seemed everyone else I usually spend new years with are either interstate, or going to a rave, or had other plans. I don't have the money to throw around on a flight, nor do I like drugs and dance/techno/[whatever its called now] music, and I prefer parties where I know more than one person. Yes, I am an introvert.

So I spent the night by a fan, usually playing World of Warcraft, or chatting with my parents. Went up to the nearby park which has a nice hill for viewing fireworks all around the city - we even had a local not-quite-legal display going there. I tried to get some photos with my phone, but I generally mistimed it. If I can be bothered, I might post some of the better pictures.

More posts soon? Maybe.<br />&nbsp;</div>"

Other random LJer comments...

<lj user=""anjil""> - I like your plans for NYE. I must try and be in Germany around the New Year sometime.
<lj user=""hyperevade""> - Thanks for the work on the convention site. One less thing I have to stress about.
<lj user=""mrbehemoth""> - Welcome back. Looking forward to tales of your trip to Europe (or any other tales you write - always enjoyable).
<lj user=""mrs_cake""> - Good to hear you're enjoying your time back in Germany.
<lj user=""psonicblast""> - Hope you're surviving okay without Internet - I think I'll be facing that situation myself over the next two weeks (at least, when I'm at my new place) because I'm not expecting a quick connection for my new dsl account.
<lj user=""yobbbo""> - Have fun in Canberra (sucker!) ;)

And to all - I hope you had a great Christmas, and had/having fun on New Years.<br />&nbsp;</div>"

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;if it was just the two of us, tomorrow, with no itinerary and and no obligations, you know what I'd do?&quot;
&quot;Go on.&quot;
&quot;We'd go swimming in the morning, like I used to do on the last day of &nbsp;a family vacation. I'd get up early,maybe &nbsp;even skip breakfast, and go down to the pool - you know, that slightly grungy outdoor pool that came with every anonymous motel - and go for a swim and try to stretch out every possible moment until check-out time, just to make it seem like that last day was a whole day of vacation, and not a whole day of driving back to where school would start on Monday, with the plaid skirts and the grey cardigans and all that boring routine. It was worth it, even the part about having to take my soggy swimsuit in the car, because it smelled of chlorine and sunshine.&quot;

It's ok for the necessary long hauls.<br />Buses? I've yet to take the Bolt bus, but for the most part, see the above comment about Greyhounds. Even for my daily commute I'll take a train over a bus,<br />Trains are lovely, leisurely and social. They can even be scenic, depending on your definition of scenery.<br />I'm highly ambivalent about cars. Mostly they're a necessary evil, and after doing 11 hours there-and-back for a two night stay, I'm happy that I'm back in my own bed.<br /><br />We had a great time, the comedians and I. The show went off as planned, not without a hitch, but as smoothly as could be expected, and with the bonus that we got to see a comedian who is absolutely at the top of her game. It was a master class for the semi-pros watching in the wings, and a hoot for those in the audience.<br /><br />On the way back, I was already starting to lay plans for - no, not the next trip (that's to Seattle next week) but the trip after that (Montreal in May), and a couple more that are still in the dreamtime.<br /><br />I don't believe that I've been exposed to West Nile virus or the avian flu, but I am now 99% sure that one of those little wee midges that bit my ankle in New Orleans in January of 2012 must have infected me with a rare sub-tropical disease. It made me lose all tolerance for cold weather and dreary grey skies. When I close my eyes sometimes I am back there, walking the uneven streets, or riding the ferry to Algiers with the aroma on the breeze of pralines being made on shore. And always I can hear the music. If you're the type that suffers from malignant earworm, all you need to do in NOLA is walk down the street and listen to the music falling out of every door way. Only other place I've been where the music is so pervasive is Cuba,<br type=""_moz"" />"

I was back to work in December, but am only feeling back to normal this month, as January was a month of rebuilding muscle and stamina - including a joyful visit to Panama, where walking the beach, swimming in the pools, and hiking up and down the hillside for breakfast, lunch, and dinner became their own built-in exercise regime.

The phrase rang a bell again this week (which for a number of reasons is a Week From Heck), when a dear friend - who is still in hospital after seven-ish months - became more disoriented than usual.

I knew, but did not see, that it was now attached to a subway system, and that the reason I was walking there was that LaFashionista and her boyfriend were ahead of me, trying to catch a train, and I needed to catch up with them. <p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Instead of being filled with people, kiosks, planters,  and colourful advertisements, the atrium space was grey bare and sterile. The pillars were of f white in colour, the floor a speckled grey linoleum, and the light was not artificial , but natural , flooding in from the upper stories. There were no shops in the niches around the atrium, only empty archways.</p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">As i neared the place which I presumed to be the entrance to the underground/ subway system, I saw that this part of the mall had debris on the floor &ndash;mostly  broken glass, but also broken bottles of different colours. Still, the place was silent, empty of people, and there was no dirt or other debris &ndash; just  the broken glass. I could not see and areas of damaged or broken glass, so could only conclude they came from above.</p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">I was not alarmed, but somehow I knew that I should not continue to pursue Karen and Tyler, but continued to the opposite corner of the atrium. There was an area that had aluminium cafe tables and chairs, and looked out through glass window-walls to a sunken garden.</p>  <p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">I was sitting at the table when my friend Firestorm the Nuclear Man came by wearing a long coat and carrying a briefcase. He stopped briefly, and apologized that he couldn't stay, saying that he had to get to campus. I noticed that under his coat &ndash; which  at second glance could well have been a dressing gown &ndash; he was wearing brown corduroy slippers and brown-and-yellow plaid pyjama pants.

I've been here for five and a half days now, and I have already enjoyed some lovely warm summery weather, a chilly evening with a hint of November, and am now having a glorious autumn. It maybe that winter will come while I am still here, but I will be prepared for that."

"event","&nbsp;Had one of those nastier migraines last night. The problem with not having migraines all that frequently (but more this year than last, I've noticed) is that I totally missed all the warning signs (lights seem a little too bright, voices are a little too loud) and went right into a full-body sensory rabbit hole.<br />Being hypersensitive to light, sound or odors is bad, I will concede, but being hypersensitive to touch is the worst. I oddly like my body had turned inside out and I wanted to crawl out of my skin. My love, so caring and attentive, brought me water in a familiar glass, which felt much larger and heavier than it should have. Like Alice, I felt as if I had shrunk several sizes smaller.<br />It makes me wonder if Lewis Carroll was a migraineur.<br /><br />=================<br />The episode was brief, and my eyes opened at what will be the right time for the next couple of weeks: 8 AM Central time.<br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;I was out at a dance the other week with (of course) a small group of lovely women, some of whom were out dancing without their wives' company. That did spark a conversation about social expectations in the tight-knit lesbian community. It was one of the women's dances where the &quot;single ladies&quot; are encouraged to buy a glow-stick bracelet to indicate their status - and none of <em>us</em> were buying. I brought my new roomie along even though she is mostly interested in men, because she loves dancing and was hoping for some good music.<br /><br />The tall femme is married to a older butch who also enjoys dancing, but is far less social. I have seen dance together in the past, doing that ballroom thing that seems to appeal to my demographic, and they fit together well. But at other times Tall Femme&nbsp;goes dancing on her own, and is aware of the looks in her direction from others in the community who expect her and her partner to be joined at the hip. They've worked out their own social routine, so no one else should really care - but Tall Femme is aware that she has to be discreet in public, sitting out the slow dances, and not getting too close. It's something she's gotten used to, this compartmentalization of her life. Many of her family are Mormon, and although she enjoys spending time with them (including her seventy-five nieces and nephews), not all of them accept or fully understand that she is gay.<br /><br />She mentioned that they had been together for 12 years, and married when they could. &quot;That's like forty in het years,&quot; she laughed.&nbsp;&quot;Why is that?&quot;, New Roomie asked. Tall Femme explained that gay couples don't get the social support that mixed couples do, and relationships suffer because of that. There's an irony there, that a society that refuses to accept same-sex relationships can also criticize gays for having a short-term, unstable relationships. The flip side (especially I think for lesbians) is the U-Haul syndrome, in which unsuited couples meet, quickly move in together, and stay in the relationship even when it's not working, because it's so difficult being alone, and so difficult to find the right person.<br /><br />It made me remember that actor from &nbsp;Welcome Back Kotter, Ron Pallilo, who was sixty-three (too young, we would say), when he died of a heart attack this year. He was survived by his partner of forty-one years. Now that's an amazing amount of time for any couple to be together, but even more so for a gay couple. I remember thinking how wonderful it must have been for them, to find one's soulmate &nbsp;so early in life. But if &quot;gay years&quot; are worth 3 and 1/3 &quot;het years&quot;, then even a ten-year same-sex relationship is quite an achievement.<br />&nbsp;"

Each of us would wake from time to time, just to open an eye and watch the other sleeping, and once or twice, when we were both half-awake, to kiss and drop off to sleep again.
In between, there were dreams, that felt pleasant at the time, but on waking reflection developed a dark cast. In one, I was homeless for some unspecified reason. I remember asking people if I knew of a place to rent, or even just a place to stay. I started out asking about apartments, then about a room, and then asking if I could share a room, and finally I said I was willing to share a bed. Yet none of this felt unusual or scary at the time.
In my final dream before awaking, I was in a vast banquet hall, surrounded by relatives and friends. The food, all of which looked unusual to me, was being dished out buffet-style but female Asian servers. There were multiple courses(although I don't remember consuming any food) and as the evening wore on, there were fewer people that I knew, the dining area faded away bit by bit, and finally it was just me, standing at a table with two large serving trays, facing two Asian women in burgundy chef's jackets in the middle of an infinite featureless plain. A vision of heaven or hell, I don't know."

"event","&nbsp;Was about surgery, and medical stuff. No surprises there, as that was the topic of much of last night's conversation. The new parts: I was the patient, and the surgeon - who operated on my ears - was the Mormon trickster from our choir. The surgery was more complicated than expected, as he had never operated on anyone with my underlying condition. Again that piece drawn from the context of last night.<br /><br />Lessons? I need to listen more. I need to really<b>&nbsp;really</b>&nbsp;listen more.<br /><br />I also need to hook the trickster up with Estrellada, as they both work in social services in the DTES, for networking purposes. He sometimes has low-cost housing openings that he wants to fill; she sometimes knows people who are in need of low-cost housing.<br /><br />ETA: shouldn't write before coffee, shouldn't write after alcohol. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","My friend in hospital is doing, they say, better day-by-day, but that's only in relation to where she was before the double-lung transplant. <br /><br />It is interesting, sez her wife, to note how many people have fallen off the bandwagon in the week since the initial surgery - a week which my friend spent mostly sedated, undergoing a second surgery, renal dialysis, and really too much pain to endure while fully conscious. Recovery time to release from hospital is usually measured in weeks, but the wife let slip yesterday that it may be months.&nbsp;<br /><br />Meanwhile a number of the people who were in her support group have signed off, satisfied that the goal has been met and all is well, despite the consistent messaging that she's not out of the woods yet, and that, although there is progress day-by-day, it is measured in baby steps, not giant leaps. <br /><br />Modern medicine does work miracles; i have experienced this myself. My personal 9/11 story involves entering hospital by ambulance on September 10th as quite a sick person, and leaving it on September 13th essentially as healthy as I am today, nearly 11 years later. That can't and won't be the case for many, including my friend.<br /> <br />It is heartening to know that there are more people coming on board with offers of assistance, and assurances that they will be in it for the long haul. It has, however, been an experience of winnowing out the true friends from those who for their own needs and reasons, can't be as supportive.<br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;Pride lands with a bang and a thump in the middle of summer. With luck, we get summer weather too. In the jumble of events, what stands out?<br />Watching fireworks from a rooftop over English Bay; it's good to have friends in high places, especially when there is dinner brought up from the 9th floor. Not exactly a Pride event, but when you're sitting a table away from an ex-MLA/current city councillor and his spouse, it might as well be.<br /><br />There was that semi-dreadful lesbian opera in which they tried to break all operatic conventions, but ended up reinforcing quite a few. Having a soprano play the &quot;pants&quot; role (in this case a tux, oh she wore it so well) instead of the mezzo was a great idea. A tragic opera with a happy ending, it was missing a lot - some light comedic moments, a chorus, some <em>melody</em>, for goodness' sake. Shirin Eskandani, as the mezzo at the centre of the boi-girl-boy triangle was luminous, and made the piece worth watching, and worth listening to.<br /><br />I didn't make it to the Dyke March this year for a number of reasons, and well, I really didn't miss it much. If my best memory of last year's Dyke March is the truly excellent Vietnamese sub from Paris Bakery on the drive, then something is probably wrong.<br /><br />However, I did watch the parade - and that was a first for me. In the past I've either avoided the parade, worked the festival site, or marched. None of these prepared me for the visual display, the choreography and the energy of the participants I can remember the no-fun 90's when the Pride Parade was the only parade in town, and everyone went. Despite the occasional nudity and non-stop outrageousness, it still feels like a family-friendly event. I had a great time, and more importantly I had enough energy to go to my favourite dance venue that evening. <br /><br />The Rowing Club has a perfect view of Vancouver Harbour, and I have friends who can be depended to save me a ringside seat on the deck. It's a necessity, because even when the weather is so-so, the dance floor is gets hot real fast. Dancing at the rowing club is like going to a sauna - or perhaps an energetic version of hot yoga. You jump in for a few songs, then grab some liquid and cool off on the deck, as you watch the sky darken, the downtown towers light up, and the moon rise over the water. It's an over-forty scene, but by the end of the evening everyone is pogoing on the dance floor like we were all seventeen. And there are always a few hot 20-somethings who seem to have got the wrong address, but are aiming to misbehave.<br />I had a particularly good time. I brought a woman who had never, in all her years in Vancouver, attended one of this DJ's dances, so she was fresh meat in the eyes of horny lesbians looking to hook up over Pride weekend. I've said that it's no wonder that 90% of lesbian couples seem to have Pride weekend as their anniversary. I exaggerate of course, but I suspect that U-Haul has to bring in extra moving vans for the following week. It was fun to watch my date as various women tried to chat her up - and to watch her flirt right back. A couple of drunk hotties were flashing in exchange for beads, and women dancing in lines, circles, couples, and solo. The best thing of all was knowing that that very hot woman, while revelling in the attention, was going home with me.<br /><br />On Tuesday evening, I travelled through a rare electrical storm to attend Queerotica, a long-standing event that started as a fund-raiser for the Little Sister's Bookstore obscenity case. I suppose someone might point at the thunder and lightning as proof of some angry god, but it made an excellent backdrop for the readings, as light flashed and rain beat against the converted railway roundhouse. Not all of it the readings or the readers were all that good, but there were a few highlights. The only poetry of the evening came from C.E. Gatchalian, who puts words together wonderfully and reads them well. Hiromi Goto was charming, as she posed the twin questions: &quot;How can I say I am a writer when I am not writing?&quot; and &quot;Am I still a lesbian if I'm not having sex?&quot; And Michael V. Smith had the mostly-lesbian audience in the palm of his hand with a coming-of-age story of anonymous outdoor gay sex. There was much laughter throughout the evening, which I think is essential in the world of erotica. There is always a bit of the ridiculous about the act of sex, even when it is done by the most attractive people in the most attractive ways.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is more to look forward to - the Queer Film festival is yet to come, and perhaps, for next year, some projects of my own.<br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;My friend in hospital got a new set of lungs on Saturday. This seems quite miraculous. It wasn't until they had decided to go forward with the surgery that they told her wife exactly how dire it was: they could have kept her alive another month on oxygen - maybe two, but that was unlikely.<br /><br />She's not out of the woods yet - in fact, she's not even awake yet. Last night we were talking about what it would be like to be sedated for that long; this is day five, and they don't expect to bring her out of it until Friday.<br />It's been quite a ride for those closest to her. I've just been cheering on the sidelines for this one, popping into the hospital briefly, making sure her wife got something to eat &nbsp;that wasn't hospital cafeteria food, that sort of thing. And mostly listening, because there's a lot of emotion that gets pushed aside while you're playing the waiting game.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","Fake, because I burned through all my annual vacation halfway through my trip south in June, but I wasn't going to let that stop me from taking the ONLY TWO DAYS AVAILABLE all summer for me to take some time off, paid or unpaid.

First, I asked for time off to spend the second week of August hiking with my HighSchoolGirlfriend, who just had a lumpectomy and is seriously worried about her husband's job stress and mental health.
DENIED.

Then, I ask for time off in the third week of August to go to the Fringe Festival with the BrigadierGeneral, who is somewhat overwhelmed with caregiver stress and is seriously worried about her wife's terminal illness.
DENIED.

Then I just started to ask for random days off just to piss off the boss who denied the first two leave request. I got them, and that relieved some of my stress about my job, for now.

I can say that I had a great weekend in Seattle with SAM and Samantha. If you get a chance in the next month to see the exhibit of Australian First Nations artists, please please do. Just skip the exhibit of Pacific Northwest First Nations art. The curator has managed to make a dead thing of a living tradition."

"event","&nbsp;Escaping from the cool weather and gloomy skies of Vancouver, I hit the road with a pal of mine, and headed for downtown Seattle, in search of Creole food and lesbian bars. Not disappointed on either score: now I know what red beans and rice are really all about (fresh sage in this case), and had a wonderfully relaxing time in the no-hanky-panky bathhouse, followed by girl watching in the bar upstairs. Sadly, there was no pool table, but can't complain. The waiter gave us beads that colour-coordinated with our outfits for a little fun - although later, in the washroom, I noticed that the shade of blue actually matched my bra strap, not my tank top.<br /><br />Sometime during the evening, I started to feel a like an Edmontonian wearing shorts in Vegas in January. Locals were drifting in wearing leather jackets, cardigan sweaters, and hoodies in those muted shades of grey that are so typical of the PNW. There I was sitting comfortably in my tank tops, my companion in a tshirt and shorts, while the Seattleites huddled against the cold. After temperatures in the teens, Seattle at 23 degrees felt like summer to me.<br type=""_moz"" />"

1 case of (item code) 16423&nbsp; (description) G/F MULTIGRAIN CRACK

 Whoah! Gluten-free and multigrain - that's some crack that's better for you in two ways. 

It reminded me of the time another customer wanted to make sure he got a case of The Naam's famous mushroom-flavoured miso gravy, so he wrote down &quot;14073 shit gravy&quot; . Delicious.

But the worst part was when the Operations Manager called the IT guy into her office because her Outlook inbox &quot;didn't look the same&quot; and made him re-set the column fields while she stood over him. A fine use of resources, and pretty much sums up why I want out."

Comfortable seating with cupholders, and the new tent isn&#39;t as stifling on a warm day as the old one (I used to call a matinee at Bard on the Beach &quot;Sweating with the Oldies&quot;, as the audience skews towards the elderly for daytime perfs).

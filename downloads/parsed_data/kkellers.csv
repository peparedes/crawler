I'm just chilling at work until I have to do phone teaching and one of my students asked if I had a blog and I first answered no and then decided why not write something and see if anyone actually still reads it.

Good times, there are so many things I could write about.  I guess I still can't believe I've been in Korea for over 5 months.  It's an experience to say the least.  Well I hope all is well with whoever reads this and if you actually comment- I might end up writting more.

Lots of love from the other side of the world.

"event","I once again will update this thing considering I don't do it that often.  My life is going good- still working on the job situation but I'm sure everything will work itself out in the end.  I guess why I'm really posting to this thing is to talk about a boy....  YOu are prolly thinking- Oh crap, not another bitching post but I pormise you it's not.  I went to Iowa a few weeks back and met a guy who is amazing.  He's funny, cute, and most importantly (well sorta) he made sure I was alright all that night.  I think I drank a little too much.  Since then we've been seeing each other and he will be coming this weekend which is like a 5 hour drive to visit me.  I will meet his Dad on Saturday and I'm pretty sure me, him, mark, and Kelly will go out to eat on Saturday night.  It will be good times had by all.  I don't want to write too much in here but now my friend John is teasing me because this is now the third friend that I have dated- oh well.  Anyways, I miss you guys a lot and I hope I see you before I move to who knows where.  All my love as always~ Kelly"

"event","Well, once again I made my way down to the great city of Ames- or is it more so the bunker in that city that makes it amazing?  All I know for sure is that it was a lot of fun for me.  There are no words to describe it and you sorta have to be there too really understand.  There was lots of alcohol and I had the opportunity again to see John and Brianne.  There were other cool people I met down there but I really don't want to go into details on this.

So yeah, life is good and I don't know what else you guys are looking for and you really need to chit chat some other way then just through this thing.  I hope everything is good for you and yours and I'll catch you guys later."

"event","Ok guys- seeing since I am getting posts on my wknd- I was really bummed about the whole situation and I thought LJ was there so you can posts about things like that.  I am sorry if I offended you but everyone has certain feelings whether they are rational or not.  LJ is there so I am able to get the bitch off my mind and move on.  

Ok- but this is a post in response to a few comments that people make that pisses me off.  I'm sure all of you poeople work very hard at grad school butI do try at school and work my butt off as well.  Just because I don't bitch about all the time I spend on homework, and school, doesn't mean I'm worthless and don't do a good job at it.  I have been on the dean's list last december and got a 3.66 this past semester.  I am not one of those people that never do homework and I'm sorry that I have to bitch before you guys think that I do.  I have pulled all nighters and I work my ass off; so don't give me this crap that no one understands how it is to be in college.  I just don't bitch about it because I don't feel the need to bring it up.  So before you go posting away about how your lives suck and how you are so busy-  Don't undermine the rest of the people.  I'm sorry that you guys are busy; but don't mistake that I am able to do things on a few wknds, as meaning that I have an easy courseload.  For those of you that don't know- I am taking two capstone courses.  All of my classes are at least 300 level.  I have 15 credits and I am doing an internship and tutoring and working a desk shift.  I do try to savor my wknds because I work hard during the week and I have been making sacrifices to see people because in the end- that is what matters to me.  I care about my grades and I am making sure that they are not suffering for this.  Currently I am getting at least three A's in my classes and at least an A- in another-= the last class I am not sure but I should at least have a B or better going.  If you want to bitch about what you all have to do, that is your peragative but do not and I reapeat DO NOT ASSUME WHAT I DO BECAUSE I HAVE NOT COMPLAINED ABOUT IT!"

"event","Hey guys- 
Once again I am going to post an entry about my wknd before Halloween.  Well as some of you may or may have not known- I went to Chris and Jenn's house in Chanhassen.  It's usually the only house I stay at in the cities- probably because it's the only place that I know how to get to and they are the only people that invite me over.  I'm always up for a weekend spent with friends if anyone a.) invites me, b.) I'm not swamped with homework and c.) enough warning time that I can come.  I say that because it really isn't an invite if you go the day before or on the day you want to see me, invite me.  That is not enough time at all.  

What is sad about going to the cities is that I never seem to see anyone else there.  It's not that I don't want to but something always gets in the way or people find some reason to back out of going out.  Wendy- I do understand that you were unable to make it which sucks- but maybe another time?  I'm not trying to be mean here- but you can't expect people to always come to you when you want to hang out.  That is not an equal tradeoff- so if you choose not to come out- you shouldn't complain that you never see anyone on a regular basis.   With that bitch off my back- I'll continue by saying it was an awesome weekend.

We went out to uptown and I dressed up as a belly dancer- you should have seen my costume- it was hott!  Jenn went as a mime and Chris as a fire crotch- no joking.  Jenn's friend- Nikki went out ande I never really figured out what she was going for.  There were a few others in the group that we went out with and they all seemed to be a lot of fun and have fun.  Although I do have to say that drinks in Mpls are much more expensive then in EC.  I had a good time and some people got my costume while others didn't= even after I showed them the moves- Stupid girls that are blonde!  I did get videotapped by a person and had fans of my moves.  They asked if I really bellydanced or if I just had the costume.  I ended up saying that I could and then demonstrated- that was when they videotapped and clapped loudly- it was a group of about ten.  In case you guys didn't know- I am an attention whore so I absolutely loved it.  I also showed a couple of moves to people that asked me.  All in all, it was a blast even though I froze on the walk to the bars.  It was nice having that extra hour of sleep this morning and I really don't know what else to say here.  Good times as always.

On another note, I am dreading Tuesday- I guess I will see if I'm emotional or not?  I hope I'm not but I never really do know.  For those of you who probably don't know- my mom will have been gone for five years on Tuesday.  That's enough of that- and I will hopefully talk to ya all later.  Peace out."

"event","Blah- it's been a long week and I've been studying for exams it seems nonstop.  My mind is swiss cheese!  Ha- my friend got a good laugh out of that when I said it.  On another note- the relationship I was super excited for is seeming to not be working out for the best.  I do care about this person but right now I don't think it's logical to continue when it will be forever until I see him.  So I think we are going to be in an open relationship or just go back to friends until we are able to see each other more.  I wish he was here because it would be different but maybe it is for the best- lots of things change in a short amount of time and I don't want to hinder my other possibilites nor his.  I'm not actively pursuing anyone at the moment but I'm not opposing the idea either- oh hell- I have fun no matter what and I'm pretty sure he is too.  So yeah, that's whats up with me.  

Other than that, this weekend will be another one well spent with Chris and Jenn- it seems as if I am always visiting them but that is probably because I actually am.  They are fun to be around and I haven't had a bad experience or a disappointment yet when I am with them.  Still working on my halloween costume.  Other than that- I'm planning on going to Iowa State again in November which is super exciting- MARINES!= that is all I really need to write.  I hope all of you guys are happy and I support you in whatever decisions you decide to make.  Oh and I finally got my Deluded t-shirt- and yeas I earned it.  

Take care and hit me back if you are ever in the area!"

 Life is good but that's not a big shocker.  My best friend just came this wknd.  It was an amazing time and I had my first and only person of this semester share my bed- it was hott!  I feel as if I'm different when I'm around her.  I'm happier and I enjoy life like no other.  I also can't stop laughing which is a good thing and needed.  At times it feels like we are in a relationship because we buy each other things and go to each other's houses for the family dinner- good times are always had.  I miss her already and she was just here a day ago.  Oh well, I'm sure I will see her soon.

As for other things, some asshole has my ID and will probably use it to get into bars- grrr.  I hope they get busted- other than that- there isn't anything else I feel like writing now.  Peace Out."

It's been awhile and since you may or may have not have talked to me, here's the update of my life.  Homecoming was for the most part good- although there was drama here and there but that sometimes happens.  I took many pictures and I may or may not be willing to share those with you.  I'm really liking that saying, so bear with me.

I am in a relationship which makes me happy although there are a ton of skeptics out there.  What differece does it make to any of you if I am happy.  Can't you guys just be happy for me?  That is not directed at all of you but it is directed at some of you.

Other things happening is my best friend is coming to visit me this wknd- I can't hardly wait.  She completes me and she'll say the same about me.  I'm never as happy without her as I am with her and I'm planning on having her in my life for a long, long time.  I'm still exercising and doing belly dancing.  I do care about what I look like believe it or not and I think I'm more pleasant when I do these things.  I love to get my dance on- Good times.

Other than that, I don't have much else I want to report on here except always make sure it is alright with someone before you do something that could potentially piss them off and back them into a corner they don't want to be in.  If you guys are good which I know you are- you will be able to figure that one out."

"event","Hey people,

Well me life as of lately is beginning to become more busy as I progess through this semester.  I started my internship which so far is just reviewing what other interns did there before I got there.  It isn't that bad but it seems like I'm stuck there forever.  I also started my other job which is tutoring for economics.  I am actually the only econ tutor this year which is kinda scary.  My office hours are actually being utilized this semester as I have had at least one person come in every hour I worked this week.  The most was three girls at once- it was kinda overwhelming because I think a fourth girl wanted to come in at the same time which I was like- omg- this room is not nearly big enough for that.  Other than that, I'm also working Governors Security once again even though I didn't sign up for it  I figure I could use the extra cash and lately there has been a ton of lobby rats until I leave at three in the morning and they are still there- it kinda reminds me of how we used to roll way back when.

On happy notes, I have once again started my workout program to look amazing- not like it's hard for me.  I have went swiming twice in which each time I have swam at least an hour in laps.  It is so amazing the feeling you get when you are done.  Plus I don't think it's one of those workouts that you sweat and just feel disgusting about.  Oh, and me and Reyna are now going to belly dancing lessons- I'm so excited!!!!!  We barely got in and just by mere presence and persistence- we were allowed in.  It was crazy but we were both increadibly happy.

Other then that- I""m going home this weekend to say goodbye for now to Jordan.  He is going back to Korea for a little while and then to Germany for a year.  Me and the family (His and my best friends that is) are celebrating Thanksgiving early this year. I love always being included in another family because at times I view mine as being disfunctional- but that's just me.  I'm happy to be seeing both Jordan and Nicole.  I might also stop off at Wally World to see one of my friends there.  In any case- it will be a good time!  Next weekend I also have plans with Sara(my old roommate) to spend time with her and her family as we float down the river and look at all the leaves changing colors- that should be good times as well.  If you guys have anything coming up- you'll prolly have to give me a few weeks notice because it seems since last semester that the majority of my weekends get planned ahead of time so I'm always doing something with someone or I'm just visiting Chris and Jenn's.  Oh and our Homecoming I'd like to say is the first weekend in October- well that's all it for now.  Take care guys and all my love is being sent to you."

"event","Hey guys and girls,

It's been awhile since I've wrotten in this thing so I decided to do a little update on the hectic thing that I call life.  I just got back from Vegas on September 11th and let me tell you things were hectic at the airport.  We did various things like going to shows, some gambling, shopping and the taste of the world.  I love Vegas but there are so many people spending so much money.  I wish I had more money that I could blow.  Oh, and I sorta went camera happy taking pictures at various casinos.  I actually hit all the big ones and walked the strip.  Good times.  It added to my mood when my friends called me from Wendy's party- that means at least some of you guys think about me when I'm not there.  Oh and before I left I hung out with my best friend.


Other than that.  Class is going well.  At times I think it will be difficult but I always end up managing.  Especially lately now that my personel life isn't crashing every few weeks.  I'll begin my internship on Monday which right now seems overwelming.  I'm in a group of 4 with 3 guys in my mgmt 449 class.  One of them I know because he's an econ major.  A good thing is they are the cutest guys in class- got to love eye candy.  There is another guy in my compensation mgmt class that remembers me from previous classes quite well- for some reason I always think that I'm invisible and nobody notices my presence.  I'll once again be tutoring for economics but at this time I'll be the only one.  That is flattering considering how many people could tutor and the economic department picked me.  I'm smiling inside.  Oh and apparently Jennifer Lee signed me up for shifts which one I can't and won't work (Friday night, Saturday morning) dream on.  I'll end up working monday night security- at least it will get me some money for food.

With all that going on, I'd like to mention I'm planning on being in the cities this wknd and if you guys want to see me- just let me know because I will be in town.  Well take care guys and keep in touch because you guys really do mean the world to me."

"event","Well guys,
It's been awhile and there are a lot of things that have happened in that time.  For one, I am now a year older and had my Golden Birthday.  I absolutely loved that my closest friends were able to attend it with a few exceptions.  It was a night that went better then I could have hoped.  You guys always have a way of making a girl feel like she is the luckiest in the world.  I hope you enjoyed your stay in Tigerton and had a few laughs along the way.

Over summer, I was also able to hang out with my best friend since before kindergarden.  We have many momments that still astonish me.  She is the closest thing to family and it's almost like she is family.  I truly do love this girl although don't be twisting my words here.  There is hardly a time that we don't have fun overall.  It's funny how I'm always at the family events when even girlfriends and boyfriends of the family aren't there.  I don't even know where to start on telling stories about her.  Sad thing is I think we overdo drinking while together because it seems like we are always getting up on the bar.  We also have certain songs that we play over and over again.  Aparently when she went out this weekend she was asked by numerous people where her other half was.  She ends up making comments like ""I complete her"".  I sometimes wonder when we will ever settle down or stop being so out there- prolly in a few years.  Nicole ended up saying that it's best I go back to school because she is having too much fun and not concentrating on her studies enough.  It was also really sad saying goodbye to her for awhile- I almost started crying- but we still have the cell phone I suppose.

Then there is Walmart- I gained a lot of friends over the summer and it was hard to say goodbye to them too.  There was also some psychos but that is probably whereever you go and plus I need some stories to rattle off when I see you people.

Then there is the lovelife- it's complicated but not.  I am very happy that I wasn't attached to anybody from school.  I finally got to juggle guys and go on many different dates.  Although some assholes start rumors that get back to my family- Grrr.  I'd start writting about a couple of different guys- but it really hasn't played out and I don't know how it will go...  There will probably be good times to come and with at least one of them- I suppose I could see future potential- only time will tell.

Other than that- I have two very awesome roommates and I'm very happy with them.  I love all of you guys and I wish you the best.  Keep in touch."

"event","It is so surprising how short life can really be.  We fret and talk about things that in the long run might not ever turn out to be anything.  Yesterday at Walmart a woman drove her truck into the wall and nearly hurt and possibly killed two other workers that I talk to on a regular basis.  It was lucky that they managed not to get hurt but it really makes you stop and think and even re-evaluate your life.  There are so many blessings that are bestowed on me but it could all be over tomorrow and that is quite a terrible thought.

I have been pretty happy all summer but I guess by checking my email today is what really got me down.  Joe Gapko died this July.  It's funny because I swear I just talked to him the friday before finals on what he was looking to do with his life.  Surprisingly we had the same internship lined up- he was doing it this summer and I was going to be doing it in the fall.  I had looked forward to speaking with him about it and he was always an interesting person to talk to but not it appears that that won't be happening and it's just a little bit depressing.  Joe is the first friend in college that has passed on and I just can't help but think how short life really is.  I don't think I can say if I died tomorrow that I have accomplished everything I wanted to do on this earth but then again- can anybody.  Anyways- this is getting super depressing so I should be going.

For those who don't know yet- I'm having my golden birthday party on August 26th.  Call for directions because I would love to see you all!"

I'm keeping in touch with as many of you as possible through the phone because I have limited internet access.  The past couple of summers I think I used it more mostly for one reason or another but mostly in the hopes of talking to a person.  The love life- I'm sorta seeing a few guys- nothing too serious yet.  I'll see if that changes.  Work- is surprisingly not that bad either- I have found a really good friend who when I'm with them- the time flies.  She says the same thing too.  We both usually don't get along with girls but we get along perfectly together.  I'm happy but also very busy so I should get going.

As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't supposed to 
ever let you down probably will. You will have your heart broken probably 
more than once and it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so 
remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight with your best 
friend. You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. You'll cry 
because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you 
love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've 
never been hurt because eve ry sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute 
of happiness you'll never get back.

Don't be afraid that your life will end,
be afraid that it will never begin."

"event","Tonight was another exciting weekend spent with the best friends a girl could ask for.  Ofcourse there was a few people I wish could have made it but that doesn't always happen.  My skydiving didn't take place because of weather conditions which sort of sucked but it did save me a lot of money.  I'm bummed but this too I shall get over.  I for the most part did well in all of my classes- there is only one I'm really nervous about.
Moving on- Ken- if you are reading this- I know we tend to bicker a lot but over the last three years- you have helped with issues such as uni and other things that I personally wanted to cry about.  It is fun to tease you and when you tease me back.  Next year will not be the same without you.  I know I sometimes devoulge too much info but then again I know about you too!  I hope to see you this summer and you are the only one that helped me stop by pinchy when I wanted to kill him.
Mark- It has been fun getting to know you as well.  You have one of the greatest girlfriends in the world and I wish you the best in the future.  Although I don't appreciate you pushing me onto girls.  Ootz.  I will miss you to- make sure to visit.
James- It's been a great time with you too.  You tend to be logical and know what to do even if I don't always follow your advice.  It has been interesting to see how you became less shy as time went by.  I hope you and Ingalls have a blast living together.
Jim- I hope you have an amazing time in Florida.  I'm sure you will do awesome and go onto do bigger and better things.  I guess I won't be seeing Conquest in my future anytime soon.
I think I covered most of the graduates that read this thing.  To everyone else that has graduated already.  It is not the same without you here.  It's like a big chunk of me keeps leaving and I'm stuck here.  However, me, Reyna, and Jack will be graduating in December and Eau Claire will become a memory.  I wish you all the best that life has to offer because you guys are the best and are the reason that helps me get up in the morning.  I know I usually don't say this in person because I don't like getting emotional.  Anywho- I did get a new Screen Name which I'm sure I will be contacting you  on because I love you guys.  It's going to be limited access so I do ask if I tell you it- you don't give it out.  I feel like an asshole blocking people and I'm not too sure who all has my SN already.
On another subject- the thing I learned the most this year was that of love.  The person you tend to love doesnt always share your same feelings.  I have stayed up many of nights crying over this fact- I have tried blocking this person out of my life too.  I just wish the pain would go away.  Maybe it's that I'm dwelling- but it's been 5 months and 11 days and it still feels like I got kicked in the stomach when I think of him which tends to be at this time.  It is his loss but that doesn't really make me feel any better.  I really don't understand how he can go through so many relationships and yet I shy away from them because of distance or the fear of being hurt again.  But what used to be love really turned into hate- I say I want him to find happiness but what I really meant was I wanted him to find happiness with me- if that makes sense.  I'd like to say we will actually be friends in the future but I'm sure you all know that won't happen anytime soon.  I guess the easiest thing to do is say goodbye and not answer emails or anything like that.  I have the opportunity to move on and some really great guys to move onto.  I feel bad for bad mouthing dave so much because you guys don't know him and what I have said will prolly make you never want to meet him.  However, he does have a side- I just dont know what it is and after this summer- I don't think I will care.  The one thing I look forward to is seeing my friend John who is going to set me up with a hot, single marine and it will be good times if I'm not in a relationship over this summer.
Ok- my rant is over- everybody have a great summer and keep in touch and I will be giving you my new SN shortly even though I don't have internet over the summer."

"event","This school year is coming to an end.  This is a time of happiness but also a time of sadness.  Looking back on the last 4 years of my college career makes it seem like it past with a blink of an eye.  I experienced my first boyfriend, had my first heartbreak- not the same person, did my first keg stand and many other things.  Some of you got the chance to see me get up and dance on the bar at Brothers.  You guys have also been there when I told you stories that happened in my life- some more disturbing then others.  I thank you all for opening up and showing me a little bit of your lives as well.  It's surprising on the friendships that I have gained and retained and how first impressions don't always last.  The boys of 407 are graduating this semester along with a few other of my friends.  I thank all of you because you do make everyday a better one for me, by just being there.  We all have our moments and our friendships do get tested but in the end- it brings us closer to some and splits others.  I'll truly miss the people that are graduating along with not being able to see the people that have already graduated nearly enough.  I still have one more semester with the rest of you that are staying.  I'm excited and scared.  Then again- it might all be over for me next wknd because I'm going skydiving.  If this is the case- I have no regrets and I will die a happy person with a guy on my back.  I wish you all the best as always and don't let minor things ruin your mood."

Eating with a guy named Fabio that has my exact birthday.  Only needing an 80 on my final exam to get an A in a course.  Then it comes to tonight or Cinco de Mayo.  I got to see Cops Eau Claire Style.  When I got up to my dorm- some guy was so drunk that he shit his pants and puked all over the guys bathroom.  Just to end up getting a message from a friend that said they aren't able to see me technically today.  I'm kinda bummed but that happens.  I just took a hot shower and I should go to bed and hope tomorrow or technically later today is better.  Chao."

I'd recap it if I could, but it's so hard to put down in words what all happened.  I'm in a state of awe and that's all I can say.  The one regret I have is not making it up the hill in time to spend some time with Brandon.  However, I will sometime make it up to him.

"event","Well, life is still good.  There isn't really that much drama although my best friend had me leave her at the bar again.  That didn't make me feel increadibly good but people will do what they want to do.  I also got to see 1/3 of my class- it was good times because I usually don't get to see them.  I had a lot to drink- I think about the same I did for my 22nd birthday.  I ended up puking which isn't that common with me.  It wasn't the best night but I'm not complaining.  I started taking a lot of shots and I no longer tasted them.  I think I get overly happy when I see classmates and the cool thing is that they can pronounce my name and know some things about me.  The guys in my class are at the same stage as I am- not in a relationship and not really looking to settle down.  I think I have reignited one of my old flames for one of them.  I'm not sure how I feel about that because now I'm fantasizing about him and yeah- I have more erotic dreams that include him- I think I might have just included too much info.

Other than that- it was nice seeing my dad again and ofcourse spending time with my kitties who really miss me.  I was once again treated like the queen I deserve to be treated like and I have found my self to be more honest with my dad.  He was once again hitting me up to know about my love life.  I ended up saying I haven't been in a relationship since the beginning of December.  I was more willing to talk about some of the things that happened then I have been in the past.  It was kinda a relief to actually talk about something I focused on for quite some time.  I think it's showing that I'm willing to accept what happened and move on from the ex.  On another note- Vball is coming up and I'm so excited-  Good times to be had by all and I do have stories that if you guys are interested in, I can tell you because I don't find it appropriate to write everything I do in this."

"event","I had another awesome weekend although there were a few mishaps.  One being I got lost coming back home and it prolly cost me a couple of minutes of my life.  For those of you guys that didn't know- I went to the cities to see chris, jenn, wendy, and andy on friday.  It was good times even though this time we didn't get the cops called on us.  I was impressed and I don't think we were so roudy.  On saturday I ended up hanging out with them until around 6.  We watched full house, ate some food and enjoyed the good times.  Then I made my Long, and emphasize long trip down to Iowa.  Once again it was well worth it by everything I got to experience and enjoy.  It was unfortunate that John passed out so early but I got to spend plenty of time with him today with his girlfriend Christina.  She is the coolest, cutest, person I have ever met and she was just a sweetheart to me.  We went to breakfast, got ice cream and caught a movie before I made the trip back home.  At the party I was complimented on what I was wearing and John said I looked good and he was impressed with how the workout was going.  I got a lot of hugs and took pictures of random people.  It was so fun and I did my first ever keg stand- Go me!  Anyways- there are too many good things that happened and this small post doesn't even come close to covering them all.  Take care readers!"

"event","""As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't supposed to ever let you down probably will. You will have your heart broken probably more than once and it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight with your best friend. You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, LAUGH too much, and LOVE like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back.""- I thought this was a good quote.

On other notes, the other day I guy asked if I could cut hair and then said he wanted a mullet- it was kinda funny so ofcourse I laughed.  On other news- I think my sisters and mine relationship could be on the break of ending.  I'm so upset with what she said, that I don't care to talk to her until she apologizes and if she doesn't, I don't see myself ever talking to her again.  Her birthday is the 27th of this month and if she hasn't said sorry at that point- I'm not buying her anything.  It's going to spiral from there and I know I should be the bigger person but I don't feel like I need to.  Why should I always humble myself.  It means that much to me because she was wrong for saying it and if I don't stand up for myself-I'll be a pushover.  I'm not giving on this one because I don't want to talk to a person who never admits when they are wrong.  She ended up trying to tell Dad that she didn't mean it like it came out and I said what he related to me was nothing like what she actually said and I deserve a damn apology.  I'm so bull headed but it means that much to me."

So here is the backup story, I want to retake one of my classes that I did really poorly on to raise my GPA online this summer.  So I called my dad this morning to see if he could get internet for a few months so I am able to take this couse.  So tonight I got a phone call from the bitchy sister asking about what I was thinking.  First of all, I don't think I should have to justify my decisions in life with her.  Moving on she ended up saying I should rethink this decision because she thinks I'll do poorly again and won't be able to ask anyone for help.  I ended up saying something like you are always there to help me.  To thist she ended up saying ""I'm not going to take the class for you.""  This pissed me off to no end because I have never asked her to do a course for me.  I'm in charge of my own life and I don't think it is appropriate that she thought this because it has never happened in the past.  I will finish this entty by saying ""Fuck you Jill- you are not my mom!"""

"event","Well, this past weekend was fun.  I got to celebrate Becky's birthday and it was everything I was hoping for and so much more.  I especially loved the piggy back ride I got from Shenans to Toco John's- it's a really long distance for a person to carry with another on their back.  It was so cool and I'm sure it looked amazing as well.  Once again I ran into creppy guys- I'm beginning to think that that is the story of my life.  Ingalls also visited this weekend- it's always a good time when my friends come back to visit and I can hang out with them.  I attended a Leadership event this past Saturday and it was really fun and I met some really cool people.  Paul Shepard was there and told interesting stories and he also said ""Leadership is for everyone""  I guess I should have went to more of these events throughout my college career.  I soon will be getting a cool tshirt and cd of pictures taken during this event.

As for saturday night- it was really fun and I really do enjoy spending time with Brandon.  He ordered pizza and we watch King Kong- the movie was kinda long but still really good.  Then we went to get his car followed by getting some food to eat.  Brandon is a really good guy and I'm able to talk to him about my future.  Then again, I'm tending to talk more about it to more people as I begin to figure out what to do with my life.

Now, one of the interesting things brought up at the Leadership day was whether you were in an abussive relationship and that could be emotionally abused.  I found that question to be interesting because I think you answer it according to looking at what has happened with you and other people.  I really think that the answer to that question is ""YES"".  I have noticed that talking to a particular person just ends up with me feeling bad about myself.  I can be really happy and then talk to the person or try to talk to them and end up really upset afterwards.  Heaven knows I have tried cutting this person off numerous times in the past- I just find it so hard or begin to question myself.  After all, I did love this individual for quite some time.  My friend Ken had an interesting point.  He said if all your friends don't like a person or they think that the person is bad for you, they probably have a point.  I just get so blinded and keep thinking that maybe we will become better friends or he'll treat me better.  What does that say about me if I continue to let a person treat me like crap?  I'm not close to that time of the month, so this person can't say I'm emotional.  This guy ended up saying ""You can't make me feel bad... What do you want to guilt me into a relationship?"" a few weeks ago.  I guess that comment hurt me more then words can ever say.  I guess I haven't learned the skill of being incensitive and he has used that against me numerous of times. You guys have read or heard my bitch about Dave numerous times and I don't know if it will ever stop.  He hurt me and yet continues to try to do things that will hurt me and yeah.  Seriously Dave- if you are reading this- just stop- I'm tired of everything and the same shitty excuses.  I'm tired of being a picker upper- You have serious issues and I can't help you and if I try- I just end up broken.  I hope you are happy with your life and don't even bother anymore- I want you gone.

As for the rest of you, I love you guys.  You have been there when shit has happened and picked me up again.  There are some of you that I don't know what I would do if I no longer talked to you.  I love my close friends and you know if you are one of those.  Keep strong and if you ever need me to return the favor- you know the number.  Take care and may God grant you happiness in everything that you do."

"event","Well, I have been working on a project for one of my classes for most of the night but it hasn't come along very well.  I'm frustrated, tired, and just in general upset.  I decided to watch a little tv because there is only so much searching I can do before I go crazy.  Plus- I'm trying to take a step back but I'm not too sure that is working for me.  So ofcourse I end up watching a romantic movie that ends up making me cry my eyes out.  I think lately I am becoming more emotional when I see these movies and someone dies.  I think the movie was ""Message in a Bottle"" with Kevin Costner.  Basically it's a love story and the girl walks away till the guy is over his old love.  He finally decides that he will let the past go and go to her and win her heart.  The twist is he ends up dying trying to save another at see.  I suppose luckily they found the letter and the woman read that he loved as much as the previous person and he was coming to visit her the next day and win her back... I just can't handle emotional movies that well.  Someone dies and it reminds me of what my dad is going through.  I was talking to my friend John the other night and through the conversation I finlly think I have a grasp on why I'm not in a relationship although he says I'm taking the cowards way out.  I don't think I could deal with losing someone that I build my life around.  I'm scared to death of watching someone suffer like my mom had.  You would think I would be over that incident by now but it does keep coming back to that.  I realize people die everyday but not all those deaths are slow and agonizing.  My worst fear besides watching another loved one go that way is me myself experiencing that.  My uncle Howard was diagnosed with cancer and told he was terminal.  He ended up taking a gun to his temple so there would be no more pain and he planned it at a time when his wife had their son there to take care of her.  He knew he only had days left, so he took it into his own hands.  Now all the religious people out there end up saying because of this act, he is going to hell.  If that's true, I don't know if it's fair.  I know this is a fairly depressing entry and I am really surpriesed that you guys have read it thus far.  I'm just so sad and I don't think it's right that good people suffer.  I remember praying that my mom would pass and a day later she did.  I really never told anyone that before but it was crushing to see the person I loved suffer the way she did.  I had hoped that she would wake from the coma that she was in to actually say ""goodbye"". The night of her death- we sat around the bed in the Hospice wing and talked about the good old days and we all saw one tear roll down her face and maybe that was her goodbye.  All I know is that for me I haven't really found the happiness that I once had.  I used to laugh non stop untill I was almost in tears and my stomach hurt.  I don't laugh like that anymore and I'm not sure if I will ever get that back.  I feel like I'm just doing a show so people don't isolate me like they did my whole senior year.  Nobody wants to be around someone that is sad.  Well this is depressing enough for one night."

"event","My last few days have been very interesting if not a bit confusing.  I'm going home and seeing one of my best friends tonight where there will be some drinking and good times had by all.  I love her to peices and vice versa.  On another note, lately I've been considering guys that I have never thought about before.  It's kinda weird on some of the dreams I've been having.  However, it could be that I watched a Walk to Remember right before I went to bed and wanted to talk to them.  But the latest guy I thought about has blew my mind.  He is the closest guy in my graduating class and I've never thought about it before.  I guess my thoughts are going there because I want something spontaneous and out of the ordinary.  I want something.... It's hard to explain but sometimes I feel very predictable and solid but I want to do something unlike me and see how that treats me.  My life is lacking on too much excitement except when I see my amazingly close friends.  I feel like I have to be mature or people will make assumptions.  ON that note- Haneo to Chubs telling me what my dremas can be and what my expectations will end up being.  This really pisses me off to no end.  I don't think anybody has the right to make fun of you for your dreams or say that you can never acheive it.  What, just because you graduated and you have a job now, it makes you an expert?  What an asshole!  It's not like I haven't worked in a factory and I know how the world works.  How can people assume about you when they know little about you and only met you once?  Damn- my entry just became bitter.  I guess what I'm trying to say is don't make fun of people for their aspirations and don't assume stuff you have no knowledge about.  Take care and have an awesome spring break EC people.  Also everybody is Irish today!  Sorry Tim I didn't make it to Vegas, maybe another time?"

"event","Ok- I do realize I don't update this that much.  I usually only end up writting when I'm sad, stressed, or pissed about something.  That doesn't mean that's the only time I'd like to write, but it's the only time I feel I have something worth while to say.  It's crazy to think that next year at this time I should have a job and working some where and I won't be at lovely UW-EC- it's kinda exciting at the same time.  Ok- where to start.  One of my good friends, John turned 22 yesterday- I somewhat wish I was able to visit him.  For those of you who don't know him- he goes to Iowa State and he renews my faith in men daily.  We have deep conversations every now and then and from talking to him- he has made me a better person.  I totally love this guy in a nonsexual manner.  I was also to go out with my old roommate Erica to the Vagina Monologues.  It was a good time full of many laughs.  Looking back now, I can't believe 4 years have past.  Our opinions have changed so much since then- it's crazy.  I was so in love with Jason while living with her that I never really loved this college because I went home every wknd.  Thank god that I didn't end up with him!  I do believe that God has saved me from things that would make me unhappy in the future.  I feel very blessed with all my good friends I have.  Spring break is around the corner and then I will be able to hang out with some of my closest friends that I don't see nearly enough.  I laugh so hard when I'm with my close friends- maybe that's how you can tell with me if I'm close to you or not.  Nicole brings a big smirk on my face when I hear a couple of our songs that we sang.  I miss her so and talking to her makes me laugh- even though we sometimes bitch about things while the other laughs their head off.  We have a funny relationship like that- she also thinks the swords in my room are awesome!  I also miss Cari who is probably really showing her stomach off now.  She gets my dreams and my weird thoughts- I don't feel safe sharing the stuff I share with her with people in Eau Claire- with a few exceptions.  Then there is Megan who can be best described as C-R-A-Z-Y.

So yeah, I'm kinda random now so good luck if you can follow my train of thought.  I am happy, don't get me wrong- but at times I feel so increadibly lonely.  I haven't had anyone near and dear that I saw daily for years.  Matthias is over in Germany and I don't know if he will ever come back besides his promisses and his eloquent words.  What's sad is I'm not completely over Dave- I was so in love with him.  He made me feel something and at one time I could share everything with him- some stuff I wouldn't dare to write in here.  He completed me and made me more of what I am today.  The thing is, that both of us have changed in opposite directions and we've sorta ran out of things to talk about.  This isn't the only person that this has happened with but I do feel a void with him no longer being there.  In my mind, I put Dave on a pedistal and I know I did and he probably could never live up to my expectations but there was something about him.  John the wise guy he is ended up saying ""you have to get over him hun"" and I know it's true.  I love John although he always states the obvious in such a way that I can't get mad at him.  He shows compassion which I don't see in a lot of people.  He is so understanding and patient with me and I can't thank him enough.  Then there is a different friend of John's that I might talk about more when the time comes....That's all I'm saying.

Well- I think that is enough randomness.  I had an away message up yesterday that said something to the fact that you should keep the people that make you smile in your life while avoiding the people that make you cry.  Take it deep and I get to finally be done with being the cordinator for the SEA social tonight!  Woot... Later loves!"

It seems like my dream of a trip for my golden birthday isn't going to be happening and I feel so lousy because of it.  Also the internship that I got and was relieved about turned out to not count for my Capstone so now I have to do some other shit! DAmmit, Dammit, Dammit!  It is so frustrating!  I'm also trying to set up a social that isn't coming along the way it should.  Why the hell do I get dumped on to do everything while other people sit back- what do they think they can get by on their looks?  HA  On a positive note- I'm a tutor for economics and I got paid for two hours with noone coming in and it is pretty decent pay for that.  It also looks good on the resume- dammit resume.  I signed up for a room and they ended making me take another room and surprise, surprise, I'm rooming with Lasley's girlfriend!  That I didn't plan on and it will probably be awkward next year- Oh well- that's enough for now.  Good day..."

"event","I've noticed that the last few days have somewhat been stressful.  The reason for this is that the reality that I'm going to graduate sooner then I think is coming up.  I'm preparing for interviews for internships and trying to get all my shit together.  I'm also applying for a job that will cover my service learning.  Another thing I'm applying for is to become a tutor for economics students.  I think by doing this I will meet new people and go back and cover stuff I forgot about economics.  Did I mention this will look good on the resume?  So anyways, I have two solid amazing people to give me recommendations probably for my future job and maybe past that.  I totally miss having these professors in class and talking to them afterwards.  Talking to them makes me feel knowledgable and it's like they know what I'm going through.  It doesn't really feel like teacher-student with them.  I guess it's all about having equal respect for each other.  Looking at one of them, I realize that is the type of guy I want to be with in the future.  Someone, I can sit and talk about the future with and has a genuine interest in what I'm talking about.  I think this helps explain the whole Matthias thing, plus him being cute doesn't hurt.  Plus it seems like more and more people are starting to talk to me and asking for my advice on things.  It's shocking and it's trully a sign that I am an upper classman and they are looking for some input.  In a way, I wish I could go back to the beggining and try to start over and do things different in my college career.  However, I have learned so much and even the bad stuff has made me a better person.  I'm also more knowledable on relationships then what I was when I came to college.  

I am overall happy with every aspect of my life now.  I'm trying not to repeat the same things I did in the past and at times it feels like I'm just cutting people out of my life who don't get along with me.  It is so easy to ignore people that it is scary.  I'm so tired of considering people close to me who don't consider me close to them.  All I get to hear is how their life sucks- I'm tired of being a counselor and saying it will get better or I understand.  Their foul mood ruins my good one.  People drift apart- it's a part of life- WHY CAN'T PEOPLE DEAL WITH THIS?  I don't really care about the drama in peoples lives like I used to.  My close friends never drag me down and I don't drag them down.  We are able to sit for hours and laugh it up and talk about crazy stuff in the past and in the future.  They don't sit around and whine because they are still living in the past.  Life after college is what you make it and you can't expect it will ever be the same.  Why do I feel I'm one of the few people that is okay with this?  My life will go on and I'm sure theirs will too as soon as they stop living in the past and letting everything get to them.  Now I will admit that I have had drama in my life and bitched but I've been done bitching for some time and I""m finding I don't need someone to make me happy because happiness comes from the inside.  Ok my rant is over- I hope you all are good and everything in your life is amazing- Take care and God Bless YOu!"

"event","Well, I continue on my work for an internship.  I'm not sure if I'll get it but if I do- it will be one less thing on my plate.  It would be fun to live in Eau Claire for the summer but it would be sad at the same time.  My best friends are at home and can't visit that much for various reasons.  I want to be there when Cari has number 2 and I'd like to go out with Nicole on the weekends and do what we do best- Pick up guys!  I miss these ladies because they make me a better person- they understand me, and they love me to death.  Yes, I do have friends that love me and think I'm crazy.

On other news, I'm working on an International Project that is due tomorrow.  I think I'll do okay even though I don't know if I have nearly enough slides- I like winging things- it's fun and exciting.  I also wrote my boy today.  It was a simple email talking about life and all that good stuff.  He's so funny and everytime I get an email from him- my day is made.  I have to wonder if I'm using him as an excuse not to get involved with anyone else.  Someday I'll know that answer.

I also got to go to the movie ""I am Cuba"" which proved to be pretty interesting yesterday.  I went for many reasons, one of which is extra credit in my AIS class.  Plus it helps broaden my horizons and all that jazz.  Then we (me and Erin) stopped by the Cabin and listened to a pretty good band with one pretty hot guy named Sam.  There I ran into Dana, who for the past three weeks- I keep seeing her after not seeing her for the past 1.5 years.  She's fun and a good person if not a little bit crazy too.  Anyways- I should go and all I have to say is Why can't it be warm yet???"

-Good Friends that pick me up when I'm down and always find the right words at the right time.  I got more calls this wknd from lots of different people that just made my heart smile.  I love you guys! :-)
-Good Family.  My Dad does everything he can for me.  He pays for tuition and sends me letters when I'm feeling down.  He would give the world up for me.
-My body.  I'm actually beginning to love it.  Yes Ken, I know I'm tending to take more pictures of me then you have of yourself.
-Good Classes.  Well, I'm dropping one of my headaches to achieve this one but for the most part I love my professors and they always keep me intrigued.
-Excitement- Lately my life has been more exciting as I try new things and explore my options.

Things I want....

I keep thinking of all the things due this week and the next and then thinking about going to La Crosse this Saturday to see Kelly.  I'm nervous about going there because I don't know what kinds of emotion will hit me- last time was a complete disaster to say the least and I don't want a repeat- although it's never bad seeing Kelly!  I'm nervous about possibly running into David because I don't know what to say if I did.  I doubt I will ever know what to say and besides I think everything that needed to be said has been said already...  Idk- enough talk about that.  Matthias sent me another email today and it's surprising how easily reading his emails bring a smile to my face.  He is graduating a couple of months before me and then who knows if he comes back or not.  I hope he does for an extended amount of time because I so enjoy his company and just talking to him- thinking back now I can't help but smile but then after it's done I remember he is gone and I might not see him for a really long time.  We are trying to stay in touch through emails but that only goes so far because you can't get emotions out of lines.  I just want to push fastforward right now and get to where I'm going instead of feeling like I'm stuck.  I want to see how it all turns out and what I'm like when it's all said and done.  But most of all I just want to get through the next three weeks for sure and see how my emotions are then- I have so many projects due that I'm starting to stress.

There was many pictures taken and the cops called on us- it felt like I was back at school when I was actually in the cities.  Today I got back and attended a meeting and got a little upset.  My view is a person should get a position based on their qualifications and not what gender they are.  I was outraged that a person got a position based on that he was a guy and there were already more women then men on a committee and people voted that way for that reason.  I did speak up for this unjustice but I feel my voice was unheard by numerous people.  Oh well, when these people get into the ""real world"" they can get into many lawsuits based on this reason and eventually their beliefs will come back and bite them in their asses!"

Not knowing if I'll  be happy, not knowing if I'll be close to those I hold near and dear.  Another thing that is bothering me more and more is impressions that people have about me.  I got this a little bit while I was at home (not from my close friends) and I get that from people here or there.  The people I call friends and get close to are the ones that aren't judgemental.  One of my friends(?) says nothing I could say would make him feel bad but I don't have that same ability- Some things get under my skin by people that shouldn't matter and I don't know how to brush it off....

He was cute, funny, interesting, and listened to everything I ever said- did I mention he took me out to eat and actually paid!  Idk- I know it's good that he left before anything serious developed but I still miss him and the idea of meeting him in a year again gets me gitty- is that normal??? We talked about traveling the world and places that we've been which put me in awe.  Lately, I've been thinking of getting married more and more which I haven't done that much in my life.  I think my family got suspicious that I'm planning on getting hitched because they asked me about it on vacation and what was up with my love life.  Ofcourse I told them it was none of their buisness which I firmly still stand by.  However, I'm not getting married any time soon because one of my friends is already going through a divorce which is good because the guy wasn't good for her.  I don't want to chance it by not knowing enough about the person I plan on spending the rest of my life with.  

Still on the subject of love- it seems a lot of people have this assumption that dating a person will be perfect and that marriage means no problems.  I would have to disagree on all that.  My limited experience tells me opposite- the first guy, I felt trapped and wanted to shake him sometimes because we were so different.  And the next guy- we only dated for mere hours after more then two years of other things. Neither of these relationships really worked for me and I found myself always being the one giving up while they didn't give up anything.  Both of these guys also ended up doing things with other girls while they were with me.  The one's excuse was that we were never official.  I just get burnt so bad in relationships that I don't think I want one at this time and I'm not sure if I will be with another for the rest of my life.  I guess I don't understand why so many people fret about not being with someone so much because when I've been with my more serious two relationships- I just felt like crap all the time.  Now, I'm doing better in school and am focusing more on self improvement which is better then a guy/girl could ever give me.

"event","Well, I just got back on New Year's Eve from an amazing vacation to a place clost to Cancun.  I was a place called Playa del Carmen.  The resort we stayed in was all inclussive with all you can eat and drink 24-7 so I feel like I over did it a little bit and gained some weight which now I'm trying to work off.  I dont think it will be too long but that's alright.  I was actually in bliss over christmas because it was warm and I could be in a bikinni- really fun times.  We also went to the ruins which is probably the closest things to the pyramids I'll get to in a long time.  There is so much that I can't even begin to write it down but if you want to know- just ask- I like too talk alot.

Well now that I'm back in Tigerton- I'm getting close to my High School friends again or at least having time to talk and see them.  I'm getting to see Nicole- who was another one of my best friends ever on Friday.  I think she is one of the people I miss most when I'm at college.  We've shared so much- like our sister's weddings- our conversation and I can once again laugh and talk for hours with her.  We touched a little on our love lives and where we are and where we were and all that good stuff but it will be more on 
Friday.  Then we'll go out and pick up guys which we tend to do quite well when we are together.

Then there is Cari.  We've had so many good conversations since I've been back.  She is divorcing her piece of crap for a Husband even though she is pregnant with her second kid.  I couldn't be happier even though she will have difficulty in the future.  She tends to get me the most and when I talk to her- she understands my life and what I'm going through.  We have many conversations discussing our love life and what went wrong or what we want different.  I've noticed that increasingly I'm drawn to a couple of different guys and she says the reason for it is not that I'm meant to be with them but I can be in total love with someone someday and not have any doubts.

Then there is Angie who is in my class and has been dating a guy since freshman year and they just broke up on Christmas which has left her completely devastated.  She wants to try to work on it while the guy says its through.  She basically was crying on the phone and I felt her pain and knew somewhat what was going on.  Then there is Aurora who has been dating Scott since our Junior year in High School and she is no longer attracted to him- tough situation.  I don't know- it seems the more I talk to my girl friends back home- the more I realize that not everyone has a happy love life and most of my friends are indeed single or will be shortly so I don't feel quite as bad.  I really do miss my ladies at home and it seems like I don't have enough girl friends in college to talk about girl stuff and all that.

As for my love life.  I really, really like Matthias even though he is currently in Germany.  I can't say for sure we will ever make it work but the idea is what is sustaining me.  What is really sad is that he is more probable then the past guy.  We have similar hopes and dreams and what we want to do with our lives.  We are able to sit down and talk about what we want to be doing and friends that we have for hours and just gaze into each other eyes.  We are planning on keeping in touch through email and possible phone calls for a year before he comes back and he plans on visiting me which is super exciting.  We haven't been physical with each other for obvious reasons even though the physical aspect is in it for both of us.  It's a lot more then I have had in a long time- so far I'm so attracted to him because of the emotional aspect- the conversations on what we'll be doing and right now I'm rambling and jumpinp from subject to subject so I hope you guys are able to read it.  Speaking of which- he wrote me this ""I dont say goodbye because one sees each other at least twice in a lifetime...""  Awe- how cute

As for other news- I'm coming to terms with what I really want and what my future is going to look like.  I'm getting kicked off- update later."

"event","Well- it seems like it's that time of the year for all of us to update and reflect on what has happened this semester or year depending how much you want insight to.  This past year- I've had many blessings and met some really fun people to hang out.  However, I have lost some people that I liked seeing because of graduation and there are a few more that will join that group.  I'd like to send my congrats to the most recent graduates- Minda, Timmy, and Ingalls.  I still miss you Wendy, Lil Wendy, Jess and Jamie.  It also appears that I'm going to be sad over another person leaving my life after a short time knowing him.  That would be Matthias- he's going back to Germany and although I'm not completely head over heals- I will still miss him.  He is so cute, smart, funny, a year older then me, has an accent and hangs on my every word.  He has so many aspirations for his future and wants to travel.  He's like my perfect guy and I know if he would stay one more semester that I would fall head over heels.  He really does seem like he would be up for adventure for his whole life which is really important to me.  Did I mention he rides bikes and if he had one here- he'd give me a ride!  On a positive note, he will be back next year some time and wants to visit me wherever I may be which will probably be in the Twin Cities- so there is still hope and we will keep in contact in the mean time.  Why can't things ever be easy?

On another note- I have another final down and I feel very confident that I did exceptionally well.  That makes me very happy and content- It seems like my life is really pulling together after so much time.  I've come to terms with myself and I stoped caring about what people think of me.  I'm never going to be perfect and I'm tired for apologizing for my imperfections.  Not everyone in this world will like you no matter what you do and I would rather tell it as I see it then take into account what other people want me to act like or say.  As far as David goes- I still get upset over little things with him and it doesn't seem like I let things go with him like I do with others.

This past weekend I took another trip to Minnesota to see Chris and Jenn. It was good times and I wish I could see them more often.  There was some drinking, going out to eat, and watching Narnia which I liked- but I don't think they were extremely happy about.  Oh and it was David's Birthday on Saturday- that younging finally turned 22.  I really do like going into the cities and seeing the big buildings.  I find it to put my life into perspective and it helps me realize that you should have some fun in your life once in awhile.  I'm sorry Wendy for not giving you any warning about me coming to the Cities but I literally didn't decide to go untill after my final got done on Friday at 3 pm and then I called Chris for directions.

As far as what I'm doing for Christmas- I'm going to Cancun with my Dad, sister and brother in law to an all inclussive resort.  So that means I will be in the warmth and getting food 24-7 along with all I could possibly drink-- Good times and I barely can wait to go.  I'm going to be gone for 8 days and it shall be a blast.  It's what is getting me through finals.

I wish you all a Happy Holidays and keep in touch because I truely love you guys for all that you do/have done.  Goodbye for now."

"event","Well, seeing since some of you might be curious about this wknd and I really don't want to repeat it a million times.  My friday was awesome.  I got taken to Harry Potter which was paid for which was very nice.  Then me and david tried going to my favorite restaurante, The outback, but there was a huge line so we ended up going to Perkins.  He got all dressed up for dinner which did bring a smile to my face and I suppose I will remember that for some time  We went shopping for awhile and then went back to the dorms.  He asked me out which was sweet and I was on such a high- I suppose it was what I waited for two years for.  We watched a movie and cuddled and yeah- it was almost the perfect night.  Then life happens and it's gone.  That's all I'm really going to say."

"event","I hope I don't jinx myself, but lately everything is going good for me.  I'm getting everything I want and I'm so not used to it.  I got to go out with German boy to the bars- It was really fun and I had sex on the beach.  To follow that I got some good ole oles and got a lot of one on one talking with him.  That's what I like, one on one time with a person.  That was Monday and I was super psyched about it.  Tuesday I got to go in a hot tub which made my day.  However, lately I've been writing long entries so I'm cutting this one off short.  I hope you all are happy right now and if you want to do something, call me.... Yay- and Chris and Jenn are coming this wknd!"

"event","I tend to think I go for the impossible relationship so that I stay single.  You might think this is a joke but it's true.  I fall for people I have no chance at being with.  I tend to run away from relationship- all a guy has to do is show interest and I start heading for the hills.  I've done this on several occassions.  I guess when a guy shows interest in me, I think it's a joke or they are desperate... I can't really explain my thought process but I think that's what it is.  That or I am so stuck on a guy that I don't even look any more.

Here is my love history so far to date.  Ever since 6 grade, I fell for a guy named Matt Hunt- a guy that totally was all that and so much. He had the greatest body I have ever seen.  Athletic, blonde hair, green eyes, and a freckle on his neck...he tanned pretty easy too.  This crush has continued for a long time and when I see him or talk about him I still get butterflies.  He looked like Justin Timberlake once upon a time and our parents car pooled, and we went to the same church.  The thought of this person is the reason that got me motivated to go to school and I absolutely loved his family- My perfect guy.

Then there was Casey Zynda which was a year older then me.  He had brown hair and brown eyes.  The first guy that ever sang to me and I could tell him all my thoughts and dreams.  When we talked it was so comfortable- he's the first guy that I ever felt special around.  He would eat with me at work and look out to.  He had these cute dimples and was a real charmer.  He also was not happy when I left the job.  I remember various water fights (wet tshirt contest) and laughing constantly around him... Did I mention he was a wrestler?  

Then there was Jason Kersten, the quiet innocent boy.  What attracted me was his innocense.  I was never in a relationship with either Matt or Casey and he had never been with anyone either.  Did I mention he is still single.  However, this is when I began to realize turnoffs in a boy.  He wanted a stay at home mom which is something I could never be.  This guy also made me laugh nonstop.  I loved his family and it was almost as if they took me in after my mom died which helped alot.  He was one of 8 kids and their cousins were numerous as well which is exactly what I was looking for to fill the void.  I ended up going home each wknd first semester to spend time with him and his family my freshman year.  That got old fast....

That brings us to David Nelson.  This boy would light up every time I walked into Math class.  He was so into me and nervous around me that I felt special.  I was at the point that I wanted a lasting relationship so I met most of his close high school friends- the problem is that I fell hard for one of them the first time I met him.  David Nelson ended up I'm sure cheating on me and the boy I had a crush on told me about it- it's sad that this was my first relationship.

Then came David Krantz.  I feel for him the hardest out of them all.  He's funny and we used to talk hours to each other with ease- I really don't know what happened.  I would have done anything for this boy but it never seemed like enough.  It's like he was a combination of all the things I liked in the previous boys.  I did think he was the one but then I totally got fucked over by getting the I'm not ready for a relationship, I visited, and a week later we was dating another chick.  I guess we have too much in common or that's what he says when I don't know what we have in common anymore?  It has been two years and this kid has ripped my heart numerous times but now we are working on being friends again and going to V ball as of now together but nothing will come of it.  I can't wait for this guy my whole life and I don't want to- I just get a broken heart and all we do is bitch at each other which it hasn't always been like.

Now there are two other guys- one which is going away at then end of the Semester to the country he came from.  He is the first guy that I'm going for that is older then me and he is super cute.  Also brown hair and brown eyes, and an awesome accent- I want to smother him but I know I will not because I don't go for people.  Then there is this other guy who lives about 5 hours away.  I don't know- I feel like a princess around him and certain things already have happened between us which I'm not going to disclose but this is another distance thing.  I'm a very needy girl- I would like to see my man every couple of weeks instead of every couple on months which is why me and Krantz have gotten in so many fights because I don't think he tries and I can't be the last thing on his mind all the time.  So right now I have two little flings going on- one which will end at the end of this semester and the other I'm not sure when.  I'm sorry John that the only people I go for are your friends but if you come up to EC- I will try to hook you up with one of my lady friends and see where that takes you.

Now I'm sure that most of you have not made it through this far of my post- but if you do- kudos to you and you know alot more about the past relationships I've had which aren't alot.  A good thing is this guy from Iowa has made me one of his projects so I might get something I never have had before.... which I will tell you people if you ask."

"event","Well, lately it seems like all I do is use my LJ for is to bitch about things that piss me off- so I decided to write things that are making me happy- well sort of.

For those of you that don't know, my car broke down on the interstate in Madison this past wknd.  You might be asking why this makes me happy so here goes.  There was a traffic jam and we were on the far right side so I was able to pull off and not worry about getting hit by traffic.  I once again was shown that my family would do anything for me by coming up the next day and taking my car home even though they desperately wanted to come that night.  My car didn't break down in the middle of no where which if it had happened a week ahead of time- I'd be in Iowa....oye- that would have sucked.  I'm also happy that Matt has delt with enough of cars that he is able to fix it and I don't have to pay anything for his labor- except maybe some beer.  Plus- if I need to get a new car- my dad is there to help me out and will pay for it and have me pay it when I can without any interest!  Sweet...

Other things- I'm happy I am able to take a test and still get an A even though a lot of points got taken off because of one miscalculation that made subsequent answers wrong.  I'm glad Jack is in one of my classes and we usually are able to have breakfast together....Good times!  I'm also happy that I am able to realize I am very fortunate and I don't think I would ask for a different life.  I love all of my friends who are usually there on my bitch fest but still talk to me after I'm over it and not think I'm crazy.  I couldn't ask for a better friend that says something so outrageous when I'm pissed off that I laugh and then post it because it's unbelievable.  I guess I tend to focus so much on what I don't get instead of what I do get.  I had an amazing opportunity to go bowling with brandon this past wknd and puma and two other guys.  I had a chick flick movie time with gail and her roommates.  It just seems like I focus too much on what I don't have instead of what I do.  I probably said that already- who knows- it's late and I'm not very coherant.  I'm also glad that everything on my body is intact.  I'm able to listen to a guy whisper sweet nothings, or see good looking boys on campus and throw myself at them-- haha you guys know me, or do you?

Anyways- I think I've talked enough about all my blessings.... For you my friends- I wish you can find peace within yourselves-- there is always going to be some sort of drama, it just depends if you can take a step back and see it really doesn't matter.  What's the point of bitching about what you don't have when you could be looking at what you do have and realizing it could be a whole heck of a lot worse.  I could be one of my friends who now has a kid and her husband in my opinion doesn't respect her or poor on the street in clothes that are full of dirt.  I guess I just want to be happy.  My ex once said ""You say everything that is going wrong, but you offer no solution to make it better...what do you want from me?""  Something like that you never quite get over.  Well that's it folks..... Take care and remember to call if you need anything that I might be able to help with."

"event","So here we are...2 years, five months and 21 days after a late night meeting over Amityville Horror and Steak 'n Shake. Innumerable pounds lost and obviously gained. Thousands of useless arguments,and hundreds of useful ones. Jobs, cars and money have all come and gone. We've grown together and changed each other. We've struggled and fought and barely scraped by. We've been intoxicated, had sex probably over a thousand times, and have driven hundreds of miles to be together when circumstances have tried again and again to keep us apart. You've made be angry, been impossible to understand and have surprised me countless times.


And I still love you."

"event","The need for this journal has all but diminished since we've moved in together, but on this special occasion I'd like to write you a little note to tell you that all that you do for me is not ignored and that I still appreciate the little things. 

I know I've been pretty hard on you lately. If you haven't noticed I've been pretty damn hard on myslef, too. I don't know what it is. I just always feel like something is wrong. If I can't find something actually wrong (and this is the only time I'll admit that I'm looking for something...) I find it in myself. It could very well be this monster of a period I'm having, but damn. I have been crying like non-stop. Anyway...I apologize for being over critical. 

I noticed that you rubbed my back at Meara's place, and that now when we fight at night you inch toward me and try to make our feet touch. I notice that you ALWAYS think to ask me what I think about things before you agree to them, and that everyone you know knows all about me before we ever meet.

And I still appreciate bad breath in the moring, multiple orgasms and late night dollar menu runs. And I still appreciate cooking and shopping together. And popping your pimples every night.  

And I want you to know that I am proud of you. I know things don't always go the way we want them to, but we are young."

"event","Wow it has been some time, hasn't it?

I am sitting here in Orlando typing away next to you, but you have no idea what I'm writing. 

I have to tell you this. It feels SO GOOD to be in Orlando. To just be with you. I found myself drifting a lot while we were watching Lost today- all 9 hours of it, lol- just thinking about us living together. I am so ready for the future. I want to live in the present and enjoy each moment, and I do on the weekends, but the present is not so nice- so I just escape to my idea of how the future will be. Both the near and far future.

Sometimes I feel like just a little ball of social-injustice-fighting fire. I feel for the first time like I have some kind of calling. Some reason to be on this Earth, except I don't know how to use it.  I guess for now I will just arm myself with every piece of knowledge I can get my hands on and start preparing to write my book about racism in america and it's impact on the socio-economic state of our great nation. I think it bothers me that you aren't as pissed about it as I am. I guess I just feel like it is a battle better fought by those who know...but then again I am the one who faces the racism of the white world, they are too polite to show you, right?
ok, that was a tangent

Either way, the purpose of me writing this in the first place is to tell you how much hearing the words ""I really think you should move in with me next year"" meant to me. I want you to know that I can see and feel and hear your life change in every moment that I spend with you. I can feel it in the way you look at me, stark naked fixing your calender, or in how you touch my body, or how you respond to my moods. I love it. I hope that it isn't a stretch for you...that you aren't having to strain to do it. I guess as much as I love you- I don't want you to have to change who you are fundamentally to make me happy. You have made me happy since day one. And that has not changed. I think that we are just growing into each other. Day by day becoming more one wirth each other so that one day there will be nothing separate about us. Not that we will be the same person- just that your person and my person will be the same life. Such an exciting thought!!!

ok. I'm getting tired and I have to get up EARLY in the moring. Lets get out of here and go get naked and watch the Oscars! 

I LOVE YOU"

"event","RS-TENSTM Plus TENS Unit (T.E.N.S) Device - $75

The RS-TENSTM Plus is a two-channel transcutaneous electrotherapy device designed to stimulate specific sensory nerve fibers and suppress the sensation of pain. It is also great for medical play. It can be as vicious as a violet wand! I hate the thing:)

Physicians integrate the device into treatment plans for relief of chronic and intractable pain and for management of post-surgical pain. Since it's compact and easy-to-use at home, patients can fit TENS therapy into their daily routines. 

Frequency and impulse can be adjusted to patient need.

With the RS-TENS Plus, patients can control the intensity of their own treatments, increasing or decreasing intensity based on their need to relieve pain. For more sensitive patients, setting a higher frequency and lower impulse will gently and gradually relieve pain during a 20 to 30 minute treatment. Patients experiencing mild pain can use a higher frequency and higher impulse to produce a pain-inhibiting effect almost immediately. 

Device is flexible and safe.
The RS-TENS Plus's two independently-controlled channels operate four pads enabling physicians to treat a range of body areas. Patients receive personal instruction and a manual with the device, and its safety features ensure correct operation.

It comes complete with case, four pads, two leads, back pouch and two additional rechargeable batteries and wall charger.

Used 3x for pain therapy. In Like-new Condtion! 

Paypal (pixie.bruner at gmail.com) or cash only. Will meet in person for cash sale.

"event","It happens only once a year- The Mars House party!!!

Time	
Saturday, April 9 at 5:00pm - April 10 at 6:00am

Location	
Mars House
8620 E. Hickory Lane
Lithia Springs, GA

Doc Nebula, Pixelmonster, and Sonny (the humans of Mars House) invite you to come as you are or as you want to be to Mars House and partake in food, snacks, conversation, silliness, good company, fun and libations (underneath the stars, if lucky!).

It is also a celebration of Pixie's 39th tour around Sol so it's the last party before the big 4-0. If you insist/want to give a birthday gift, please make/create/craft/design something by hand, please. Cash is nifty too tho, LOL!

BYOB to add to the collection or personally imbibe and a main and/or a side dish is requested, bring enough to share please!:)

We of Mars House will supply some foodage, the condiments, some bread products, some snackage, yummy CAKE (om nom nom), much music, some soft drinks, the telescopes, and the sacred bean juice (coffee).

Good seating is limited - so please bring a comfy chair. We may play musical chairs, whoever wins, might get a Pixie on their lap!

Crash space is available with advance notice. There is a guest room and floorspace.


Rules-

1. This is Mars House- The cats rule here. Shadow Kitty and PC will be attending. Take your allergy meds. You will be asked to leave before they are :)

2. Do not be an a**hat. Do not bring your drama, your llama, or your drama llamas. Mars House is a DRAMA-FREE ZONE. If you have issues, or so many issues, you have full subscriptions and volumes, leave them at home please. Leave your drama at the door please. Bring only yourself and be prepared to have a good time!

3. We reserve the right to flag you and not let you drive if we do not feel you are capable. The hosts can and will poach your carkeys if you do not drink responsibly. We will also enjoy frisking you for your car keys!! 

4. Dress Code- Costumes welcome, kilts appreciated, togas loved, there are no rules. Time travelers welcome here!

5. If I forgot your significant other, bring them along and feel free to invite them. It was an oversight if I forgot anyone.

5.5 The party is kid-friendly/kid-safe until dark or midnight when the gremlins come out.

6. Have FUN!!! Be KIND! Be excellent to each other and oh yeah, HAVE FUN!!:)

7. Bring a side dish to share or a meat for the sacrificial burning of the meat"

O, Coffee!
By the mighty Name of Power do I invoke thee,
consecrating thee to Service of the Magic of Light.
Let the pulsations of my heart  be strong and regular and slow!
Let my brain be wakeful and active
in its supreme task of self-control!
That my desired end be effected through Thy strength,
Adonai, unto Whom be the Glory forever!
Amen without lie, and Amen,
and Amen of Amen."

"event","I am trying to wrap my brain around some things that bother me or that upset me irrationally and possibly even more than they should. 

Are sins of omission as bad as sins that are committed? 

Another way to phrase the sin of omission would be to say ""He who has the ability to act on an injustice, but who stands idly by, is just as guilty as he who holds the knife."" ~~Dracano Sapien

""In the end we will not remember the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends"" ~~Martin Luther King

Those silences can be deafening and in that silence, a multitude of things can speak.

Sins of omission are a deliberate act of the will, a conscious decision to commit a wrong; sins of omission are much more murky, and usually involve significant elements of denial, ignorance, and self-selected comfortability -- a foreshortening of one's moral vision so as to see a fairly narrow range of personal responsibility when it comes to moral action. 

A person can easily convince himself, with only a minimum of bad faith, that he has done no wrong in many a sin of omission; he can not do so in a sin of commission.

So many omissions. I am troubled not by my sins, but that of others and if the omissions were sinful or if they were deliberate. What is known is that the omissions have caused me pain and duress. It is also compounding. They have compiled. Snowballs into snowmen.

I do wonder how much I can simply ""let go"" at this point. 

My conscience is troubled and the scale can move so easily now.

That is all. I am perhaps cryptic, but wanted to set this down as I work thru important matters and things.

The soul takes flight to the world that is invisible; but there arriving she is sure of bliss and forever dwells in paradise. -Plato"

The hard part is over, the movie is shot, but we need help crossing the finish line.

Hi, my name is Greg Bartlett and I'm the screenwriter and producer of the short film ""Making Friends"". I first read the short story Making Friends in the anthology ""100 Hair-Raising Little Horror Stories"" over two years ago. I was instantly taken by the haunting tale of Denny Grayson, an 8-year-old stutterer who longs to fit in amongst his peers and make new friends. After I read it, I knew I had to adapt the story as a short film.

After a bit of detective work I was able to track down Gary Raisor, the author of the story, and much to my amazement he was super supportive of the idea and encouraged me to write the screenplay. During the fall of this year I sought the help of director Marvin Suarez, who loved the story as much as I did and was on board immediately. Beginning on Halloween; myself, Marvin, our stars Ethan Khusidman and Katie Maguire, along with our crew of ghouls and ghosts went into the night to make our movie.

You can watch the Making Friends trailer at the link above.

We're so thrilled with the footage that we're driven to hire the right composer to give the movie the spine tingling score it's just dying for. An off the shelf, cookie cutter horror soundtrack just won't cut it. Once the movie is edited and scored, our next goal will be to get the movie onto the film festival trail, and screened in front of the biggest audiences possible. Festival fees can add up rather quickly.

Our supporters will not only get a grateful and heartfelt thank you, but some will also receive cool Making Friends gifts like free digital downloads of the movie, autographed posters, DVDs, and actual props and costumes used in the movie!

This project is a labor of love for all involved and it's been an honor for me to work with so many talented artists. On behalf of Gary Raisor, and the cast and crew of Making Friends, thank you so much for reading."

"event","Taken from and changed from <lj user=dr_nebula>

Saturday was a weird/tiring day of traveling fun. Just over 300 miles (301.5) - first off to pickup me, then turn around, and head to North Georgia (Cartersville, GA) for Keith's 10 AM memorial service. After that, back to my house - and then dash off to the other side of the metro for a presentation (joint with Doc) at the Charlie Elliot Wildlife center. 

And at every stop - there was vast quantities of eats to consume. This included full scale luncheon at the Lutheran Church, and a Holiday Buffet at Charlie Elliot. 

The Good, Bad and the Ugly

As for the service - that was an ""experience"". Well over 100 ppl in attendance, and nearly 1/2 were from the astronomy club. The church was 'technically' Lutheran - but this was a weird Creationist offshoot along the lines of the JW's. And now mix in nearly 50 pro-science, rational and mostly agnostic/atheist club members and the 'fun' begins. Missouri Synod Lutherans- JW's in Lutheran clothing. Literalists...fire and brimstone.

Things went pretty typical at first. The music was better than the norm - with Jonn Serrie on the keyboards. The hymns - well, the lyrics were just plain weird - even silly. And sung by Klingons. Make that *drunken Klingons*. It was that bad..

Eulogies were performed by 4 people - his brother, his childhood best friend, a close friend from the astro club and Doc. Doc was the last one - in ""clean-up"" position. The first two went well and weren't too emotionally strained. The one before his started out well, with weird anecdotal stuff, but he totally broke down at the end. Very sad and emotional - so he HAD to pull this off. Doc quietly said the ""Shepard's Prayer"" (Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up. "", my favorite prayer, said before I met Sonny), took up a few notes and did his best ""Dragon*Con"" style - trying for a light and amusing ""eulogy"" of our good friend. 

It worked. And quite a few came after the service up to congratulate the doctor's effort. 

The WTF Sermon

The preacher then did HIS thing. We were a captive audience - and full of NON Believers, evil scientists and other nasty rational thinkers - just ripe for the picking! it was a Fire and Brimstone style sermon - complete with blaming man's downfall and ORIGINAL SIN for ALL the world's woes..

""As before the man's eating the apple, the world like the UNIVERSE was PERFECT. There was NO disease, pestilence, war or predation. Do you think Lions always ate other animals - NO, they didn't. They lived in peace with everything else in heaven. "" 

And so on.. 

Err. riight. Lions have those huge canines so they can suck cow udders. Or that good old T. Rex had 6-inch fangs to gnaw on Cretaceous bananas. 

We sat with my fellow astro ""Stooges"" and other astro club members. There were plenty of side-way glances, rolling of eyes and telegraphed WTF moments. As someone with a major background in geology and paleontology. Doc can cite plenty of examples of disease, predation, parasitism in organisms going back over 600 million years in the fossil record. 


Revelations

And now, you may ask - what really did happen to Keith?

It was suicide. He went off the park to heavily wooded private property and hung himself.

Some things of note..

It was very deliberate and done on his father's b-day.

It came to light after the service (I talked to a member of his diabetic support group) - he did not have good control of his diabetes and among other things - he was slowly going blind. It's called Diabetic retinopathy. 

An astronomer and lover of nature - *going blind*. Damn it all to hell..

Throw in bankruptcy, a failed business, living at home and there you have it. All you need is a trigger (most likely with his father), to set the final act into motion. 

But he had friends - so many of them. We all loved him - and he gave everything and asked for so little in return. 

And I wonder (and many others) - could we have done more..? 

:-(

I loved Kow so much,it still physically hurts me and makes me weep, nearly a month later since his dissapearence and suicide. I really loved him.We all did."

"event","Sonny is verified pre-diabetic. Diet, exercise, meds. Not happy about it at all. Obviously he lost the diabetic genetic lottery (Asian- American and Native American). Am incurring a hypo in him to see if he has true hypoglycemic reactions to rule out reactive hypoglycemia. I love my insulin pump. I have MODY diabetes, a rare genetic form.He is going for Type 2. He knows non-compliance is the dealbreaker in our relationship. I buried my mother for non-compliance and have seen friends have complications due to non-compliance and not having tight control of blood glucose levels, I will not bury him. I love him too much to see him suffer and die a slow, undignified, chosen, painful death and the loss of limbs, sight, and creativity. I cannot watch him endure needless self-imposed punishment. I hope he will comply with diet, exercise and metformin and lose the 60 lbs he needs to lose. Thank gods we cannot breed."

"event","My living room is a funeral parlor. And I can't breathe.

It's the smell of the flowers. 

This all began after I served him with divorce papers. That's when the roses started coming. First it was a dozen, then another, then another. 


Two days after the petition was served, there was a bouquet of hand-cut purple things, wildflowers of some sort. I suppose he thought that I could bought off by FTD, and then wildflowers picked and tied in a raffia bow. 

However, I was never able to be purchased with pretty. I am a botanist and environmental scientist and so is he. We know flowers, we know them well. In fact, we met when he dropped a coconut on my head as we trimmed a tree at an amusement park. I married him because he had damaged my brain. He could only be loved after enduring serious head trauma. That fog has lifted. 

My scrambled cerebellum made me believe in the bill of sale and the happily ever after and postmodern Florida coastal city suburban utopia he sold me. However, he bound my feet, and paralyzed me over the years. It was a slow procedure and I was barely conscious of it at first.

After those three rose bouquets, the flowers kept coming, daisies, common vulgar dandelions even, tiger lilies, violets, irises open to the sun, cactii with stupid googly eyes glued on them, snapdragons, windflowers, even a boston fern, a spider plant and a veritable host of hostas in a plastic window box, mint, chive and basil plants, rosemary and rue like those of Ophelia's remembrance bouquet.

Then came the amaranthus, the tulips, a dried perfect hydrangea arrangement like a translucent periwinkle Japanese paper lantern, hollyhocks, carnations of various hues and frills, their dozens of little crinkled shrunken heads on every possible flat surface in the living room by the end of the first damn week. 

I wanted to turn into one of my origami cranes and fly away.

Soon there were chrysanthemums in ornate pots and cloisonne urns better suited for cremains. Chrysanthemums are the Asian flower representing death and Mum is the word. It makes me giggle a little.

Always there was baby's breath, insidious as poison ivy, and poking its white powder-dry foliate heads from between the flowers of the day. I dreamed of being the old wives tale cat that smothered the breath out of a sleeping baby. Snuffing out the baby's breath.

They became overwhelming as well as unwanted. The perversity of blossoms began to smother and choke me with the perfumes, cloying and aggressive like a pensioners natural musk and dollar store body mist. It kind of smelled like a church. He is Catholic and I am Lutheran but we go to the Catholic Church and his family are so devout they are rehearsing for sainthood.

My feet hurt more as they broke inside the tight wrappings. I grew closer to being an invalid and struggled to even walk through the greenhouse. But it was no greenhouse. The house had become an insidious memorial arboretum.

I told him to stop, but he continued. I begged him to stop, but he continued. I demanded he stop, but he continued. I screamed and screamed and screamed he stop, but he carried on with what had become his obsession. He continued. 

More roses, even the rare green Elphaba variety, more carnations, even more roses on top of those until it looked like a beauty pageant aftermath has puked up in the house. A melee of blooms and blows. More hand-picked bouquets poached from lord knows where and I did not care. 

Dear God, just make the flowers stop! Make them die already! 

The abuse is too much. My eight-year old son was having to rescue mommy too often. I was being forced to flee my house or be kept up all night when I refused to allow him to grunt and sweat on top of me for a couple minutes that lasted an eternity. There was no reward for compliance. I could not even just lie there and think of England. 

I was uppity once. I know well-behaved women never make history. If I refused, the fights would be worse and last for hours, scaring the children, scaring me. He would lay hands upon me, in all sorts of ways, but never did he the children at least, but they saw and heard it all. They were spared nothing of the horror. They heard my screams and tears and tried to protect their mommy. 

No child should ever be placed in such a position. As the petition proceeded, he threatened to take away my children, but he delivered the threat with another dozen fucking goddamn yellow roses.

Make the fucking flowers just stop!

One day, I took my fountain pen from my calligraphy set and a still fresh white rose that had yet spread its wings. I filled the pen with black ink and inserted the pen tip into the base of the petals one by one. Working methodically. Via capillary action, the ink bled upwards from the sepals and filled the receptacle, filling it with pushed ink and wetness. 

The petals grew black and heavy. It was a delicate bulbous paintbrush sopped in ink by now. I could have painted kanji brushstrokes with it. The injection from the pen tib filled each petal with darkness and a perfect black rose was created. I hung it upside down over my lab table at work to dry the ink, shape it perfectly and thus be preserved. 

A silk flower simply would not do.

Just got back from round two with the Catholic Church. Father Gregory acknowledges that I'm hurting, and I have a right to be hurting, but if I just give this time and healing he's sure we could grow together again. My reply? I don't want to try anymore. I don't want to hurt anymore. I want to move on with my life. I don't want to be married anymore.

Now most days, I don't have a problem with Father Gregory, of course, I fly under his radar a lot. I don't think he even knew my name wasn't ""Amy's Mom"" until today.

The flower-bearer then burned my Star Wars collection. He set ablaze my Firefly. Leighton's ""Flaming June"" went up in flames. Libricide was next. He was a dork and not a geek. His cultural and intellectual paradigm was different and he forced his upon me.

I gave up so much that there was merely a ghost in the shell of my body at times, and I sleepwalked through my life, aware of the drain of my identity and personality. 

All this while the binding on my feet growing tighter and tighter and the flowers arriving and now piling up on the doorstep and spreading like a cancer into the kitchen, the foyer, the bathroom, the porch. The flowers continued. He continued.

The flowers metastasized. 

He laughed at my degrees. He hated my family. He hated my friends. He hated who I am. He hated who I could become. He did all he could to own me, but I remained a person, and not property. He could not buy me- not with gifts, not with diamonds, not with camping trips, family vacations, compliments that evolved into criticisms, and he certainly could not purchase me with flowers. 

I may have once enjoyed a colorful beautiful carnivorous sundew, sparkling with organic glue, a pitcher plant, a flowering yellow bladderwort or a mundane Venus fly trap more than the pretty and useless flowers that soon multiplied like some virus in the now-conservatory we shared, though by then we had separate beds. But still the constant begging and fucking flower deliveries continued.

He met me for lunch at one day and asked if after the divorce process was all done if he and I could still date. I asked if he were joking, as I was incredulous at the audacity and naivete of the question. He actually meant the question. I meant the damn answer I stated as well. 

So the ridiculous deluge of flowers came twice a day after that awful lunch of overpriced panini and diet sodas. That exact same day the dupek actually asked me if I had heard about people who remarried each other. I told him plainly ""We are not those people"". He did not believe me and still more bouquets. He continued on. 

More begging and more and more sickly sweet scents mingled and they grew miasmic and foetid in the household. I had to make them stop.


It was a Friday when I finally stood up to him. There was one black rose I dropped in. It is sandwiched between the casket and the warm wet fresh earth above it. I breathe easier now, my lungs expanding freely with air. 

The flowers are all dead. I am happy. I can breathe again."

"event","Sonny and I were handfasted and signed and bound by a Ketubah (Jewish marriage contract) on August 7th. Pics with this post. We are now married by Jewish law and Pagan tradition.

Getting ready for Dragon*Con (Sept 3rd-6th, Labor Day weekend, ATL, GA)as per usual this time of year. Doing a panel on Ancient Innovation and Technology (AINT) for the Space and Science track Monday at 11:30am with <lj user= dr_nebula>, a shoot for Steamy Steampunk, and will be promoting and helping out AnachroCon 2011 at their table in shifts all weekend. I am that cons director of historical (hysterical?) programming and con archivist. Cannot start the archival work until after Dragon*Con tho, not enough hours in the day to work with <lj user=kissmythistle> and <lj user= adrian76> until D*Con is finished eating everyones brains. Con work is like being attacked by zombies, it eats ones brain. Tasty stuff, that grey matter...yummy!

I have named Sonny's and my apartment ""Random House"" as random weird shit and drama llamas happen often. Instead of an Easy button, our house has a Random button and it is triggered often and yes, at fucking random. No two days are identical. It also is a pun as Gary Raisor, the Bram Stoker nominated novelist and short story writer is a roomie and we are both writers. His girlfriend of thirteen lucky years, Kay, is the artist and illustrator Kariann Childs. Much creativity here and much insanity as we have two resident 18 year old high school students, one being Kay's daughter (Amarantha aka Eimi, a cosplayer and cosplay seamstress) and Freckles (a Random) is currently couch surfing here rather than go home to her mothers after a roomate drama llama with the roomies at her household. The level of creativity and the drama that ensues from it makes things nuts and often one looks forward to going to work as it is an out from the domestic crazy sometimes. Mars House is my sanctuary and refuge when I need downtime when Sonny and I have days off. I really do miss Mars House and living with <lj user= dr_nebula> but I love and adore Sonny and our collection of misfit roomies as well.

Have begun composing and writing electronic dance music. I do the drum programming, cymbals, synth lines, some arrangement, VST choosing, composition, input, opine, make changes, and tell Sonny what I hear in my head and he makes it happen musically on computer. Learning to use Reason and Ableton Live and am enamored with the Prophet 5 virtual synth. I have two musical solo projects planned to work on soon, an original remix version of Genesis' ""Follow You, Follow Me"" and ""Home by the Sea/Second Home by the Sea"". Someone was ahem... kind enough to leak the actual original final cut studio recordings in a digital format and leaked the Phil Collins acapella vocal tracks to both songs and we grabbed them before they dissapeared from the interwebs. I only have the vocal tracks so all else will be original. Sonny, the eternal optimist and naive idealistic Buddhist (his idealism is cute but may get him killed one of these days), is working on a breakbeats version of ""Land of Confusion"" as it was also leaked. Some of the best vocal performances captured and no effects or anything n them, just Collin's singing. Many great Genesis hits and rare tracks were leaked as a package. Awesome leak and great acapellas to work from. For music, the house is the Villa Battiatii, as I am as political and clever as Lucretia (from the series Spartacus: Blood and Sand) according to Sonny (who is a Quintus who needs someone to help him swim with the sharks) and working to expose him and get him airplay, gigs and deals.

I was at CoLab in ATL 15 minutes before it got raided by the police two and a half weeks ago. The universe told me to GTFO of there 15 mins before the raid- I listened:) CoLab will be back and Sonny is spinning there September 9th from 5:30am-7am and is the closing DJ in the main room (The Oasis). CoLab will have a license to operate as a niteclub legally by then as well. CoLab is heavily represented on FB. 

Saw Zwerg over the Summer but ex-MIL (fucking evil c*nt!) drove him back to up Cston the weekend before the Handfasting so he could not be there for me, even tho P. had planned on allowing him to be there and had even said he would come down to pick up Zwerg that day and spend that nite at his mothers before heading back up to Cston and that P and I would work something out for Zwerg to be present for the handfasting. Needless to say, ex-MIL is on my kick down a flight of stairs level of Hell shitlist. P. and I get along well enough and have buried the hatchet, he is glad I am happy and mentally healthy and doing well. 

I am at peace with his finding  happiness with others instead of me and don't give a rats ass about what or who he does at all as long as Zwerg is taken good care of and thrives. I just hope he gets back to work full time soon and his life restabilizes since he was fired and lost so much when his life totally derailed in a family and family company business drama pachyderm a few months back. I really do wish him well and am blessed to not be with him anymore and to have found happiness and a better life for myself.

So...my life is good, stable, secure, awesome, sexy, an adventure, funny, and downright absurd at times. I like it:)

"event","As many of you already know on FB and in an earlier post on LJ, the Doctor and Pixie are planning a major Memorial Weekend/House warming party this weekend. (Check link for details). It is a housewarming party - so gifts/donations -etc. would be greatly appreciated.

OK - as of now we have the following for Festivities:

LOTS of hot dogs, hamburgers and some bratwurst.
Plus LOTS of buns to go with them.
A Metric F**Kton of Plastic Cups - do NOT bring anymore!!!

There will be some tasty beer and carbonated drinks also provided.
I also have limited supplies of hard stuff (vodka mostly) for mixed drinks.

We desperately need the following: LARGE folding table(s) and chairs

It would also be nice to have a ""picnic tent"" set up - as there is no big carport to hide under this time around.

Other items to bring:

- other non-hot dog/burger type meat
- other 'main dishes'
- side dishes
- salads (veggie and fruit)
- soft drinks
- desserts
- ICE
- chips/dip
- condiments
- picnic supplies - but NOT PLASTIC CUPS!

This is BYOB - but I will have some limited supplies on hand

OK - it would help GREATLY if those coming RSVP and tell the doctor what they will be bringing! RSVP means ""Respondez Vous S'il Vous Plait"". It means say ""yes"" ""no"" or even ""maybe"". RSVPing is good manners:)

Thanks - and let's have a Great Party! 



Type: 	
Party - Night of Mayhem
Start Time:

Description 
It happens only once a year! It's the Bacchanalia for Mars House!

Rich and Pixie are having a housewarming for Mars House finally and their annual burning of the meat (that means a BBQ for the uninitiated) and annual stargaze (if the skies cooperate). There will be music, astronomical shinies, good company, conversation, serious libations, and lots of good eats. The telescopes will be available if the skies are clear. The party will be child-friendly until midnite. There is ample crash space.

Bring a dish or something to offer to the grill gods (there will be various grillmasters thru out the evening). It's a potluck, but we will provide some basics like buns, hot dogs, ect and the utensils tho food is best eaten with fingers.

Welcome to Mars House and Duck Dodgers Field!

We are a VERY diverse group of folks and the PLUR rule applies to this party- Peace, Love, Unity and Respect!


Some Housewarming Gift Ideas-

An office chair throne for Rich. Plush and Comfy office chair for the Mancave (good used chair is fine).
Twin bed for guest room (a good, mildly used bed will work)
Cash and checks (accepted everywhere:)
Target and Wally World (Walmart) Gift Cards
Home Despot (Depot)or Lowes Gift cards
Amazon or EBay gift cards
Mead and ChocoVine (*giggle* - its Pixie Buzz Juice!)
Waffle Iron (Pixie groks those waffles)
A manly epic-sized tongs for the burnt offerings maker (the BBQ)

**Marvin the Martian and/or Duck Dodgers** - anything goes! (for the observatory and man-cave)"

"event","Yesterday, we ran errands in Alpharetta and we sang in the car. Snow Patrol does not have a single bad song and Sonny can sing along with Snow Patrol perfectly, gorgeous tenor voice. I like when he sings along with the radio or my MP3 player. Yesterday at midnight, I was surprised with a chocolate fudge cake with 38 candles and a question mark candle by Sonny's household. We watched some Spartacus and we all discussed the future. I will not be losing him in 15 months when Kay and Gary move to Louisville, Kentucky at the end of their current lease and after Eimi graduates. Sonny and I stayed up all night and saw the sun rise and it become day before we curled up and fell asleep. Slept until Doc called at 12:30pm and woke us up. I was told to go back to sleep while Sonny got up and did stuff and I awoke to a full breakfast in bed and a mimosa. (I hate orange juice so luckily it was in a very narrow champagne flute and I made him drink all but two sips of it for me) We toasted to us and another year. He fed me our shared breakfast. He gave me the amethyst ring I have had my eye on for two months for my birthday gift. Is not a ring of any significance other than a gift from him. There will likely be significant gifts in the future tho. Watched a couple episodes of The IT Crowd, then I reluctantly packed my backpack and left Roswell to come home for Easter dinner, which was galumpkis and potatoes, traditional polish stuffed cabbage rolls which were pretty damn tasty, and to prepare for Zwergtime this week sometime. Had a very wonderful birthday. It was certainly the most romantic birthday I ever had, tho I will never be able to listen to Hybrid's ""Dissapear Here"" CD without  flashbacks to last nights magical predawn hours."

"event","Party went well. No casualties or fatalities. Sonny was invited to spin a set again in three weeks and I am charged with helping the promoter decide the weekly fashion themes. I do not like the ""breaks"" genre of music however and will forgive Sonny for playing a Run-DMC track in his set just this once. He better not ever do it again tho! His set was good and everyone spoke for him and he now has a regular gig at Mood Lounge once a month. As girlfriend, I got to see club being set up and all and I like club much better when its all candlelit and glowing. 

I did however have my first Long Island Ice tea. Oh so help me gods, just shoot me if I ever get one again. I was sober when I drove  to Sonny's at 1am-ish, but woke an hour later with a blood sugar of 25 and woke up this morning a dessicated husk and dehydrated. Plus I was taking sips off of other peoples drinks while there, which was probably not a good idea, tho Starbursts taste just like the candy they are named for. 

Party survival tips-

No Long Island Ice Teas. I do not know what is in them but they hate me. Give all of them to Sonny. Never accept drinks from strangers either.

Stick with straight Diet Coke at Clubs. I do not like being drunk at all anymore and alcohol dehydrates me.

Always have a backup outfit, I have lost so much weight my Artifice Clothing Suspend corset is the only piece in that outfit that fits me still. Leggings and skirt literally fall off. Wore the corset with lace t-shirt and jeans instead. Not an ideal fashion statement

Find out who the people taking pictures are and post them to FB and LJ. There is a picture of Tyler standing behind me with his arm around my throat, looks like he is choking me, LOL!

Make sure Sonny does not just set the alarm clock but that he turns the damn thing on so we do not have 30 minutes to get dressed and make sure he is on time to work. He forgot to turn alarm on and we woke up when we heard conversation in the house and had to panic this morning. It may be my fault tho as we were awake until Eimi threw something against the shared wall to shut us up, twice.

Never forget you are a goth at a rave scene. Being antisocial is chic:)"

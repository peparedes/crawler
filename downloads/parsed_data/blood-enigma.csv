"event","Also.... I'm much, much to lazy to go get my notebook.
These may be too easy to guess but.... I don't really care. None of them are bad things.

1. I miss you. I can't stand that you left a hole for yourself in me and then just left.... you didn't even say goodbye. It's selfish of me to say I wish you had stayed, but I can't help it.

2. Your arrogance at times amuses me and sometimes disapoints me. I know we're no longer friends, but I read what you think and I want to try to comfort you. No matter what you do or say you'll never completely lose the amazing person you used to be, becase she's still there. The way you are contstantly depressed makes me wonder what buisness you have thinking. Joking. I know you don't care about me, but I will always always be here for you if you need me.
Ps. That one is disgustingly ovbious.

3.I worry about you. You hide so much of yourself from everyone and you neer show your emotions. Your leaving me.... not for forever, but for long enough. I won't dare ask you to stay, because I think you'll be happier where your going.I'm going to miss you.... soo much.

4. I barely know you. Even though this is true, I feel close to you and count you among my most amazing friends. I know you have secrets and I itch to know them.... sorry, that's what I do. I love you and care about you and worry about you.

5. You are my best friend. You haven't been in my life long, but you know more about me then most people do. I'm so grateful you trust me as much as you do. Your my sister, the one I know I can always count on.

6. Fuck you. I love you and I hate you. I can't stand the way you treat me, but your strength and personality leave me awestruck. Everytime I talk to you I might as well have lit myself on fire. I wish I knew more about you.... but I am grateful that I know more than most. You understand me better than most people, but you constantly underestimate me, as well as overestimate me. There isn't one person on this entire planet that I care about as much as you. Which really sucks, cause you ovbiously don't care about me that way.

7. You make me happy. I'm around you and everything seems okay. I know you would never hurt me and I know you care. I love the way you talk and the way you treat other people. Your such an amazing person that I would lve to spend every walking moment with you.


There are so many more people I could do this for, but I don't think I will. Here are two major catagories that most other people fit into.

1. I hate you. You disgust me, you piss me off and I don't even know why I think your worth my time. But I also know, that deep down in every single one of you there is a good person, so that's why I waste my time trying to find that person.

2. You are amazing. We've had our ups and downs,mostly because I'm not the easiest person to get along with. I wish I knew more about you and could be closer to you. 




That's about it. Thanks for reading, comment if you wish, and guess away!

News Flash: My cousin, the one person in my entire family alike to me, is in love and undeniably happy.

Go back to square one, Gen.

For those of you wondering, square one would be me with a horrible family.

On the bright side, my crazy minister uncle convinced my dad to let me get my nose pierced and my aunt lost around 60 pounds. Who knew she was capable of looking that good?

I'm doing alright I guess. My life isn't horrible and I haven't done drugs for 21 days. I've also been drunk for the best three. I love weddings for the reason that my dad gets drunk and buys me ceasars. I think it was around 8 of them.... but I kind-of lost count around 4.

I do realze this entry is completely long and pointless, but my extended family is upstairs drunk as skunks, so I'd rather hide down here listening to music and petting this extremely cute kitten my cousin just got.

<P>They now apparently hate one of the only people I actually care about even though they've never met him. Why you ask? Because hes that ""creep"" who's a bad influence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>If only they had any idea who I was.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>I have a plan that totally doesn't match their plan for me too.</P>
<P>My plan: Move out to Carlie's @ 17/Grad from school as soon as possible/go to college for as short as possible/Get a job I enjoy/Find love/have people around me who make me happy. Main Goal: Just to be happy.</P>
<P>Their plan: Live with them until I'm like, 23./Do every single course in school with amazing grades/go to best university in Canada/become a lawyer/ become rich, marry my best friend, just like they did. Main Goal: Get job that pays a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I need to take control again.</P>
<P>Starting with a little spring cleaning.... out with most of the negative, in with all the positive.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's working so far, in my mind. Whether it works in reality, well, I'll just have to see.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Another <EM>fucking</EM> list.</P>
<P>1- I don't eat. This I know. Does it matter? It doesn't affect me negatively.... I actually like it.</P>
<P>2- Wear colour. This is going to be <EM>very difficult </EM>for me. But whatever, most things are.</P>
<P>3- Get friends that actually make me happy.... that don't bring me down.</P>
<P>4- Get rid of my incredibly shitty attitude.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yeah. I don't understand the first one either. Oh well! :)</P>
<P>For now, I've decided to stop hiding in my house... a new idea, I know.</P>

"event","So.

I'm good at being angry, and sad.

Apparently, Not at being happy.

I think its that whole smiling buisness. Rather disgusting isn't it?

Ok.

There's lots of other stuff I could talk about. I can't seem to put the energy into being anything right now. Including being useful. So, I'll go read and listen to pretty pretty music.

"event","<P>So, I've decided.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1) People should mind their own fucking buisness.</P>
<P>2) They should also keep their mouths shut, if they plan on ruining my good mood.</P>
<P>3) People in general, if their not going to give me my way... should leave me and music the fuck alone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That's my 3 rules for today. I'm thinking the next day. And the day after that. You get my point.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyways, I've also decided that people can be worthless little pieces of shit. I know, you would have thought I would have figured that out by now but no, I still had hope in the human race.</P>

"event","I went to school, it  was semi-good.

At lunch I went to Mcdicks with Katie, Graham and Carlie. 

High-jinxs insued.

Including ice cream, fries and really nasty lard-type sauce.

Then, Kate showed me something very worth seeing during the beginning of SS.... I was late and the teacher didn't even notice. :)

After school, I tried to go watch Improv. Apparently we're not allowed to watch. Damn it.

So I bused home with Carlie.

Then I got home and my stupid fucking cat, Patches, broke my goddamn discman.

So guess what?

My parents are too broke to buy me a new one, so no more music for me.

I'm now in a very bad mood, because my dad yelled at me, as if I did it.

Damn them.
<3-Gen

Ps. I got told I was pretty today. Me? Pretty? I blushed and said thank-you. This world is very weird.

Anyways, I am now inserting me+new short hair.

You appearance and your personality are two opposite things. Even your appearance sends different signals to different people. To some you may look innocent and sweet, to others you look mysterious and intimidating at the same time. No one ever knows what to expect with you. You are a little bit of everything all mixed together. You can be watching the football game with the guys one minute and the next out shopping at the mall. You seem to be almost a different person every time you meet someone, but at the same time you know exactly who you are and there is always that one thing that makes you you.

Every word that came out of your mouth I believe was a lie. 

you think you're all these things, trust me. You're not. 

Think about all this shit literally makes me hate you. 

I don't think I ever mattered the way you said I did. 
I dont think anything ever really does. 

I'm glad I'm done with you. 

I wont ever look back on this, I promise."

"event","even though today it seems like a big deal. 
tomorrow it wont. 

and even though, I will hold on. 
some day, I will let go. 

there's just so much to say, but I can't find the words. 

this hate thats aimed towards you, was along time coming. 

It's not her, or anyone else, its the fact that neither of us took care of the relationship the way it needed. 

she was nothing more than a friend, you were the one I loved. but your insecurites and my bitchyness I guess cost this relationship. 

but don't worry, we'll both find someone else who can fulfill the emptiness neither of us could. 


I'm not going to chase you again. I'm not going to come back for it all to be the same. 

in the end I guess thats all that matters. 

I'll be seeing you. 


<small>Yeah they talk about her
She smiles like shes so tough
She says
""hey can you talk a little louder,
I don't think my heart is broken enough""

But someday we'll all be old
And I'll be so damn beautiful<small>"

"event","RECAP! baby. 

So, this past forever, taylor and I have been fighting like mad, and it sucks cause I guess I could have done something to prevent it, but I'm just so angry, and hurt by him. And I don't know how he feels or if he ever means what he says, because he says one thing and then the next day its a totally different ball game. But anyway, so last night he sits there telling me he loves me and he would stay all weekend just to prove it to me, and I told him I didnt love him anymore <small>[lie]</small> and that I find him annoying <small>[lie]</small> and that I hate him <small>[lie]</small> and then he stood up, and I followed, and I didnt think I would cry, but I just couldn't stop, and he wrote me a note on my pillow that said <small>""I guess love isn't enough""</small> And when I read it I bawled! & that sucks. On the way out the door all he said to me basically was <small>""I've waste a year on you, I don't want to waste one more moment""</small> And that really hurt me, cause I guess its a good thing I left him since he thinks Im just a waste of time. 


Then this morning, I find out jasper might have a live infection or cancer and that the chances of her making it are slim, which makes me so sad, I honestly love her so much, and this sucks. So mom's bringing her tomorrow night for the dinner, just incase it is the last we see her. :(:( I honestly don't want her to die, I just love her so much! 


And then mom and I got into it today cause I told her I hated neyney and that shes going to wreck our family, and leave us for anne, and that I never wanted to talk to her again and stuff <small>[okay, I know, I went overboard]</small> I just know shes going to hurt us. She already did once, I just know she will again. 


I was going to ask taylor to come for dinner tonight, and I guess so we could make up, but I tried to talk to him, and he didnt want to talk to me, so I guess maybe this is just best, like he said ya know, I just was a waste of time. 

I give up on life seriously. I actually want to die right now. and I hate talking like this because only pathetic people talking like that but seriously, I just do. Everything is going bad, and I hate it. 
I don't want japer to leave, I want taylor and I to be crazy about eachother, and I wish anne would just leave us alone. 

ugh.

"event","<b>Recap!</b>

Thursday! I was in musical theater, and taylor shows up totally livid, and I was like ""oh no"" and then so it turns out he found out about sam and I, talking behind his back and such. He kept asking why I wasnt honest from the start, and how I broke his trust. He wanted to know what happened in the bathroom. 
We ended up kind of making up, but, he still wanted me to pick him over sam, and I said I didnt want to lose another friend and stuff, like i lost steve and stuff, and I wasn't really willing to lose another steve and stufff. and he was like, then pick her. and I was like if i have to pick between you two I pick neither and stuff. and I was like I'll sit alone in biology and shit, and if either you actually care about me, or ""us"" then you'll get over this stuff [different wording] And then he said okay, I want you to be friends with sam then. So he sent sam and e-mail. 

Friday! I go to schoool, totally uneventful, till like lunch, taylor pulls me away from tyler, which totally pisses me off. I wish he knew what ""theres a time and a place"" meant. but anyway, so I went, and he was freaking out about me, and us. And he feels like I don't love him anymore, cause I just shrug everything, and fight him over everything. And when he tries to talk to me I shut him out. So, we kind of settled it, but then miss starts screaming at me for being three minutes late, which I know I shouldnt have been late. And then, so sam and I talked in the hall, she asked me if I was okay and stuff, and then she said she wanted to tell me something, and miss yelled at us again, so I went to class. she yelled at me some more. and then we went to the studio! and she told me I wouldnt have to fucking sing at all in this class, and so then, she tries to get me to sing, and I start bawling. lmao. which is so pathetic, and sam hugged me, andwe left class together, lol. I'm glad she left with me kind of, so I didnt really feel alone. Except, she kept wanting to talk, and when Im crying I just like to be mute. We went to the cafe, and I hugged maggie like crazy well I bawled. taylor came over eventually. but there was a fight going on, and I wanted to see, so we wnet outside, but maggie and sam wouldnt walk with us, and Im assuming its cause sam didnt want to walk with taylor. 
after that I dont know I sat with geoff love. 

I don't think sam and I will be friends as long as I'm with taylor [her choice now] and I think that kind of sucks, because I faught and almost lost him to stay friends with her, and she just gave up. But whatever right? Our friendship obviously never mattered so why should Icare anymore? Its lame. I was almot turning into a better person, and Ikind of giv her full credit. haha, but now honestly. Im just not going to give a shit about anyone really besides maggie. [when it comes to friends atleast] and tyler too, I kind of hope he doesnt stop being friends with me just cause of sam. But who knows. 

Taylor and I are supposed to be doing homework and such today, but I think he's not going to show up for some reason. 
I really fucking hate his mom, she calls my house telling my brother she thought she heard I was pregnant, and stuff. and its kind of like you asked taylor if I was:|:| and he said no, so the only reason you heard something is cause you brought it up !? :|
and then shes saying I switched classes illegally, and shes always calling the school to find out if Im not there, but she manipulates it or something..wtf? and she said all this to my brother, left me nasty messages on my phone and stuff. honestly, she fucking pisses me right off. My dads blocking there number, he's totally sick of her shit to now. Finally. 

This week has been my lowest week. Like I was happy, but it had massive ups and downs."

I hate how I cant do anything without being critized. 
I give up on feeling worthless. Like, Anyone who makes me feel like shit, I should just fucking boot out of my life. Don't give them a chance just leave. 
I just want things to go back to normal like last semester. 
I just want us to be happy. 
and to have everyone i lsot back.

I'm excited to go to bed!, and I actually love going to school. 

I have a 12% in english, way to go me. I fucking suck at life. 
I'm really bummed that i threw out my thing, like it actually makes me cry, but all they did was make fun of it. 
When i re draw it, i dont even want to sit with them. 

ugh, I'm lonely. I have no one to talk to about things anymore. 
like having another friend, outside of maggie always off sets the balance, cause I cant talk to her about stuff, cause she has no idea what to say, and taylor gets mad at me. So ugh, this smells.

<small> I really wanna be perfect for you, I want to show you what I got, and what I can give. you mean a lot to me!</small>

awe, I miss this(L)(L)

Crazy neyney. she sure is crusty! :|:|

and then, I got here, and I met anne and angela again, like properly. 
Anne and Ney has such a past, like hearing them talk, you can just kind of tell. 
I dont even know how to explain it really. 
but I feel bad for my mom, this is probably really tough on her. 

I went to taylors after, I brought him mcdonalds!(L) Lucky boy, lol, I ate like 99% of his fries, and sucked back his pop, and chewed his burg! ahah. 

then we watched longest yard? and I actually kind of liked it! I like that he like gained respect and stuff. lol. omg. I love this one part, and it just makes me so happy!

after we just chilledout, and I've now caught his cold, so monday im going to be all ugly ahah. Lucky me eh?

After that, I was like lets watch beauty and the beast, and then he was like ""Okay, but I might fall asleep cause i dont feel so well""

and then he did, and I ended up passing out too. But he was like waking noises, so i would wake up every so often. 

We called the cab, and it took so long to come, but like during that time we talked so much, and i kind of enjoyed it. We're getting more on the same page, like this morning i just wanted to kick his ass! but thats just like every other day aha :]

I'm feeling a lot happier lately though, I havent cried for a day or two, which is now an ultimate record for me. And I'm healing so hopefully i can just put cover up on and no one will see. 

I go home tomorrow, and i almost dont want to, like I'm just so content here. Maybe its because im with my mommy? (L)

idk. but I'm gonna stop writing in this for now, since im basically like rambling. 

<small>I want boobie implants, so i can have like rock hard boobies, so i never have to wear a bra, fo` real yo!

I love that picture.

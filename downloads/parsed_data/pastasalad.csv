Yes! I finished my first exam yesterday, english! It was really easy. My dad was all stressed about me not studying, but honistly what the hell would i have studyed? NOTHING! there is nothing, You read a passage and then answer questions-the end, how difficult is that? Not very. 
Anyway, back to my boring week. I've been to the mall 3 times this week already and im going again with ameria, for the third day in a row. Wow thats really werid. First I went to get my hair cut and my mom bought a few things, then my aunt took me shopping for my birthday, my mom came. Then today Natalie(my cousin) took me shopping with her for clothes. and tommaorw my dearest ameria has asked for my presence tommorw at the mall. So that's four in one week, and three in a row. Wow I really do have no life! 
Im sitting here staring at white out and looking at amerias goeurose butox! 
Just kiddin'!!!
Ameria ate one of my, PERSONAL rice crispies, she just finsihed eating it actually, (i think she likes my favorite food!)Mabye she'll go tell her dad to buy some then i can go their and eat them all, that would be good, because my pack of thiry-30 is runnign low. 
Any ways, my life is boring and you are pointless and have no life because you actually read this article, 
well what ever, we are all NERDS!!!"

"event","sorry about my other entry It got screwed up i wrote it may 6th, dont mind my stupid wording. 
Anyways spent the weekend at the cottage, with my family and amerias family and my cousin natalie. Ameria and natalie and I went for a paddle boat ride and natalie thoguht it would be funny to push alexandra, and being that im not exactly the strongest person I almost fell completly in. My legs went into the frezzing cold water and then she grabbed me and pulled me in. How fun 
Then this morning before we were about to leave the paddle boat and canoe untied and started to float away. My mom told my brother to get into the water and get them but being such a drama queen he won't becuase the water was to cold. anyways as he cryed and winned over getting into the water the boats started to float away even more. And by this time they had floated to sholuder level deepness. So my grandpa gets into the fishing boat and takes christian (my brother) with him and paddles over to the canoe and paddle boat. So when they reach the boats my brother gets out of the fishing boat and some how and for whatever reason i ending uo getting into the frezzing cold water, berrrh it was so cold i almost died. And my brother just kept crying all the way home. 
What a week end alexnadra in the water twice!"

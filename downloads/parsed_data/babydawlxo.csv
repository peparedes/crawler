"event","Adam burned the <i>Are You Afraid Of The Dark?</i>, seasons for me. haha! Anyone remember that? Probably not. I used to LOVE that show. It came on Nickelodeon. LMFAO.

I <b>fuckin'</b> love this song.

I still haven't seen the boy since Saturday. :\ I miss him really bad. He's been working super late, & if he came over after work, I'd just see him for like an hour, 'cause I go to bed early every night for school. I probably won't see him until Friday.
I think we might be going to the movies this weekend. I want to see DATE MOVIE. We haven't been to a movie in about a <i>year</i>. ;O

He burned Devils Rejects last week & we watched it on Saturday. It was good. But really .. gross! Especially this one scene.

I love the way my dad keeps it on like <i>63</i> in here. I just LOVE wearing a jacket inside.

Lately, I've been feeling .. EW.
I <b>hate</b> looking in the mirror every day & seeing the same 'ol, same 'ol. I do not think that I am even a little bit pretty <s>anymore</s>. I have just gotten so used to my face .. and its .. ugh. I don't know! I wish I were like .. pretty all the time. I wonder why I look prettiest whenever I throw on sweats & stuff? What the hell kind of sense does that make?

I've looked through MYSPACE & found some of the people I went to school with in the past. So many people that are YOUNGER than me are engaged or married. WHAT? I feel so .. behind. I mean, maybe I'm not ready to get married. But, I atleast want Adam to <i>mention</i> it to me, so that I can atleast know that he wants to marry me, someday.

Sometimes I look back & I really miss the past. I miss the friends I had right before I met Adam. I miss all the fun times we had. It seriously makes me sad to know that I will probably never see any of them again. They have moved on.

<3 Love ya'll.

"event","- Dr. White [my English teacher I was talking about] told me last week to show up for class the next day. So I did. I guess he's going to pass me or whatever since I've been way nice to him still even when he was a jerk to me. When I went to class the next day he was like, ""I wish you wouldn't have stopped coming to my class in the first place."" [I withdrew from his class last Thursday because of all that shit that happened] Oh well! He was nice to me the last 3 days of our class. I'm guessing he is still passing me. *sigh*

- School is out for 3 weeks! :)  .. well, until Winter Quarter. I am so happy! This quarter has been <b>awful</b>! 
.. I was starting to hate college there for a minute.

- I have a dentist appointment next Friday. I have to get <b>5</b> cavities filled!! Eeek! I just had 5 filled already. hahaha! YES, I brush my teeth.. twice a day! I just have so many because I haven't been to the dentist in <i>forever</i>. 

- Okay. If I see one more girl wearing sunglasses on her head when it is <b>dark</b> out, I will scream!! It ain't cute, at all. 

- These teenagers [well, maybe 19-21 year olds] live next door to Adam at his apartment.. <b>every</b> weekend their friends come over & sit in the hall outside his door talking super loud, drinking, & just being obnoxious as hell. Two guys & one girl lives in the apartment, but they have like 20+ people over on the weekends. Those little teenagers are fuckin' annoying. I swear one day I am going to open the door & just go off on them. They are out there until 4am doing that shit. It's an <b>apartment</b>, have some respect!
Last Saturday, one of the girls went behind ADAM'S APARTMENT and PEED!! OMFG! I didn't know about it until afterwards, Adam told me. Man, I would have walked out there & knocked the bitch out. That shit is so nasty. Girls aren't supposed to do shit like that. That's trashy.

- I got Adam a bottle of the new Polo Black for Christmas yesterday, because he is obsessed with cologne & he smelled it in one of his magazines. It was only like a 1.2 oz. That crap cost me $40. haha! 
Oh well! I wanted to get the new Corduroy cologne [that shit is heaven] for him, but they were sold out! BOO!!
My parents got him other stuff. Pajamas, & stuff like that.

- <b>MEET THE BARKERS ; SEASON 2 is coming on Jan. 3rd!! </b>
Best show, ever! I so can't wait.

- I made peanut butter cookies today. Them shits were good! ;P I gave one to Pepper & Minnie [chihuahuas] too. HA!


<3 Love ya'll, babies.

"event","my weekend has been crazy cool. it was better than yours i promise. kthanx.

friday night i saw jason mraz live. in concert bitches.
for anyone who thinks he sucks i hate you go die.
he's so amazing live. he's sooo awesome.
i can't even begin to describe it.
we weren't right in front which makes me sad.
but we were pretty close up.

standing next to you during all those love songs was kind of hard.
i wanted to just jump out and grab your hand but i contained myself.
because you would think i thought it meant something.
but i wouldn't expect anything. 
sometimes i just need someone to hold on to. i'd just be afraid you'd let go.

then saturday night i went to the mall with some of my babes.
then that sucked so we went downtown to the coffee shop 
and all my other babes were there.
LIKE LOGANPOLKPIE *jizzes* it was spectabulous. we embraced.
then i had to change my underwear.

and now i have a shitload of things to do.
i haven't done laundry since getting back from italy.
NO I HAVEN'T BEEN WEARING DIRTY CLOTHES, silly.

"event","shit's getting hard and complicated again.
and i'm taking the easy way out and missing school so i can make it up later.

i shouldn't do that but oh well.

i had a dream about him last night.
it was a very good dream...
i just wish i was really, truly over him.
because he's moved on fine and found someone else.
and left me here, stuck.

it's rather unfair. but most of life is, right?

the solution is so easy...you're just too lazy.
it's getting annoying. it's been like this for too long.
aren't you tired of it?"

"event","so today was pretty cool. i was tired so i wasn't as peppy as yesterday.
i'm already slacking again and i almost don't give a shit.
almost though. OH YEAH. i guess since i already know where i'll be next year.
they don't have a GPA requirement to get in. which is splendid.

i figured something out. i'm in love with you. k.
i'm sick of shits telling me i don't know what it is.
i just feel bad for you because you don't feel what i do.
i know what i'm fucking feeling so shut your face.

i shouldn't be talking to you again.
i already feel guilty. 
remember what happened last time? we ended the conversation like old times.
then i woke up the next morning wanting to put a bullet through my head.

i'm sick of shit."

"event","i finally made an LJ 
yes i'm now officially way cooler than i was already

italia was amazing, breathtaking, spectacular, etc.
met cool people like mollie, saw neat things.
took a bagillion pictures with disposable cameras
it all went by wayyy fast, yet i'm happy to be home
just sad to be away from italia

i need to get my pictures developed ugghhh
probably cost a bagillion dollars
'cause i used like seven cameras

got into the alabama school of fine arts.
that's only the easy part.
now the hard part is deciding on whether or not i want to go there.


ciao<3"

"event","I don't know about this whole blogging thing.  Am I old fashioned to prefer real email?  I remember the good old days when I would get a message from my friends that was put together for me (or a group of us).  Now it seems we just post crap out there for whomever might care.... from the voyeur looking for a juicy blog to the latest search engine.

Not that I have a choice - either I 'play' along, or I'm out of the loop.

So, here I am, typing essentially irrelevant info to exactly three people.  Now why wouldn't I include that same information in an email message?  Is this easier?  Is 'direct' communication that ineffective as a tool?  If something doesn't appear in my inbox, it doesn't get my attention.  Is that a bad model?  It's a manageable model - at least everything is in the same place.

Is it a little too egotistical?  I mean, you're forcing everyone who cares about you to do their own information filtering.  If your friend Bob doesn't care what you had to eat today, then it is up to Bob to spend his time reading it, decide he doesn't care, and then what?  Forget that he read it?  Get those 30 seconds back?  No.  Bob has to read the whole damn thing.

So, I'm either having a bad day, or I don't like this blogging idea.  Good thing I've posted this drivel for the world to see.  Or, if I'm lucky, the three people that actually look at this site.  Perhaps I should have sent an email message...

Maybe I'm just having a grumpy day.  Lets go with that."

"event","SNOW BALL WAS SOOOO FUN!!! yeah, i had alot of fun last night at the snow ball!!! i didnt really dance...(isnt that weird considering im a dancer?) but i did have fun. i feel bad for ginger rodgers. she had to dance backwards and in heels...i only had to dance in heels, but it was hard as hell. whatever. i found out that nick can dance. isnt that a crazy fuckin surprise. i also found out that ashley cant dance...but she just dosnt try. i made her dance in the end. cory look sooo sharp with his hair like that tho...he should wear it like that all the time *cough-hint-cough*. 

everybody looked so good tho...in their nice black dresses. and then there is me who showed up in a red dress...whatever, i stuck out and people noticed me. 

i had sooo much fun last nite and im tired as hell. i still have rehearsal tho and life goes on.

love always,

its really hard for me to give up on soemthing that i have started, even when i hate it entirely. school has also taken a big turn for me. i finally realized that im never going to b an actress or a dancer or a singer. im just not good enough. i may have the heart, but my skills dont match up. i really need to bring my grades up because i have to get into a good school. grrr...i hate school. but im gonna have to deal and do good in it because i think i might have to turn to interior design after all. well i gotta split and go binge on some food. lets just hope i dont throw up!"

remember not to think of yourself, but to think of others in their time of need. i didnt...and look what happened.

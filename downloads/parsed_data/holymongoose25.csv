school sucks.

english - i have been constantly handing in papers late. i keep on making excuses, like i can't connect to first class or the printer doesn't work, to conceal the fact that my papers is only half-way done and i'm pretty sure mr. hankison is feed up with it, even though he is clueless. his voice is so annoying...he reminds me of a negative and mumburing Albert. grrrrrrrrrrr......
math - math is great to me. i bow down to it. i got a 98% on the 1st test and a 96% on the 2nd test. i get 10's on all of my hw except for the friday sheets...but i got a 10 on the recent one. it's my only easy A and hopefully it will stay that way.
history - mr. hinkley is such a great teacher. he makes up all these funny stories about how the farmers are burying the govn't officials alive and the officials are still stoned and refuse to give up charging taxes even though they're being threaten to death. it's hilarious. he assigns hw assignments and usually doesn't collect or check them. there is reading hw but i don't do it. big boo-boo since i got a D on the last test. yeah.
chem - chem is hard. very hard. i don't like chem. enough said.
spanish - no comprendo mucho porque yo estupido. well, mr. daniel is being very generous to me by giving me  easy vocab quizzes a 90% on my compostion but i need to speak more in class. it's about 50% of my grade, not a good thing if you're the silent type.

and the rest of my life...

i have so many nicknames now. well, not that many but compared to the past, yes since i had only one before. i'm a josie, josy, jose, joseph, lane, michelle...hmmmm that's 5...no, 6 nicknames. yeah, i can count....hahaha. erin needs a nickname...hmmmmm....i have been creating alot of nicknames too, like mongoose and monkey and miguel (hahaha luis). speaking of guys, i have too many crushes on the guys at my school. they get you so distracted. that's a bad thing. but they're so cute....and so fun to flirt with like miguel...hehehe.

my mongoose has been frustrating me. he has been a bit shady with me. i call him but he doesn't wanna talk much. i think his other shady mongoosey friends are luring him away from me. it's sad. i feel we're growing apart. we used to hang out alot but that was in the summer when i was free...kinda.  because of school and my busy schedule, i don't see him much and i miss him a lot. i just known him for only a month and kaos is everywhere...i think about him and worry about him, not because i love him very much but i can't bear to see his life be thrown away with all the stuff he has been doing recently. i just hope he returns to his jolly mongoose self again the next time i see him.

oooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...i'm dying for a quiznos sandwich. mesquite chicken......mmmmm. yum.

anyways...i'm living life day-by-day and every day is one hell-of-a-day, filled with crappy shit (hahaha...i got that phrase from my mongoose) that i rather not deal with and hilarious laugh-til-my belly-burst inside-jokes that my friends will taunt me til my end (muggs...erin...muggs!). well, gotta wrapp this up. hopefully, i will be doing weekly updates like this...what a blast, writing until 12:47 on a friday morning. til our next encounter...tottles

"event","hell-o...these are a few doddlings of a poem that has not quite formed, but just jotting down notes before i forget them. the doddlings are about my long-time middle-school crush that took me forever to get over...i recently heard he moved to the fresno area....oh well...


My super stalker-traits are the cause of my insanity

Visions of prom corsages once forgotten

Classic flashback movies hover ghostly over my eyes

Gossips of deceiving Summer and shady masqueraders

Doodling love notes during exams long-kept burst ranging fury

4 Long years of emotions unwind outside the aging insane asylum

Moments of reunions and honeymoons lacking reality from fantasy

"event","this is cool....writing in an online journal. oh yeah, i'm having a blast....

anyways, i figure i would just post up poems or something of the sort since i'm tired of sorting out the mountains of papers with scribblings. so here it goes...

One Night Stand

                                            One night stand
Unexpectations of first timers
                                            One night stand
Eyes of a strangers forth and back
                                            One night stand
Caress fingers striptease skin
                                            One night stand
Sweat glued along the heat
                                            One night stand
Pleasure attacking each nerve
                                            One night stand
Awaked-drowsy and dazed
                                            One night stand
Comfort in his hands drift away
                                            One night stand
Unbearable awkward silences
                                            One night stand
Manipulating discussions

it's still in the works, but it's coming along. note to erin and casey.....this poem has nothing to do with....you know....
well, til next time...see ya

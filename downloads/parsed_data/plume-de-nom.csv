"event","The astrological omens are pretty odd right now. They seem to be suggesting that your luck will be good and you'll be in maximum alignment with the cosmic rhythms if you watch a lot of daytime TV, eat heaps of junk food, get no more than four hours of sleep a night, and argue with yourself loudly in public. Just kidding, Virgo. I was merely testing to see whether you've become overly gullible towards so-called authorities like me. The truth is that you should free yourself from influences that presume to tell you what to do. Get their voices completely out of your head so you can clearly hear the still, small voice of your fiercely tender intuition.

Virgo Horoscope for week of October 7, 2004
 
The British are not renowned for their fine cuisine. In any ranking of the world's culinary traditions, theirs would be near the bottom. And yet the Brits are responsible for having created and propagated the Western world's single most popular food, the sandwich. In a comparable way, Virgo, I predict that you will soon succeed in an area where you have little credibility or status. Either that, or you will produce some anomalously great thing that you supposedly have no talent for.

""So, i look out my window, and it's 3 o'clock in the morning and there is Mrs. Pour shoveling my driveway...i say 'Mrs. Pour, you don't need to shovel my driveway, i have a snow blower...' and she says:

"event","""Are you strong enough to live without answers: as a flaming inquiry into the truth? 

The following passage is from an essay in praise of asking questions rather than hoarding answers. It was written by A.H. Almaas, and is available in its entirety HERE

from ""The Flame of The Search""
by A.H. Almaas

How do you know that the knowledge you get from others is the truth? How do you know that your teachers, or even the great philosophers, have the answer that is appropriate for you? Christ says to love your neighbor. Do you really know that that is what you need to do? Buddha says that enlightenment is the best thing. How do you know that is what you need?

Some people say you have to learn to be yourself. It sounds good. Some people say you should be free from your personality and develop your Essence. It sounds great. How do you know it will resolve your situation? You don't really know whether any ofthese ideas are relevant or true for you. You can't know with certainty until you have experimented and learned from your own experience. Until then your action is based on faith or belief If you assume unquestioningly that what someone else says is the truth, your inner flame will be extinguished. You will believe that you have answered questions when you haven't answered them; someone else has. And they haven't answered them for you, but for themselves. We comfort ourselves by believing that others know, and that we can use their knowledge. It's a very comforting thought; it encourages us to be lazy. We comfort ourselves by saying to ourselves, ""Somebody knows, and in time I'll get around to studying it. It's already known and always available to me.""

But do you, yourself, really know in your heart what is supposed to happen? Do you ever allow yourself to question, to have a burning question--and not put out the flame quickly with the first answer that you hear? You put out the flame so that you can return to your sense of comfort and security.

Someone tells you that it's good to pay attention, to be aware. When you try it, it helps a little--but you still don't know whether it's the answer. You don't know whether it will actually resolve your situation. And if you believe you know, you're lying to yourself. You need to keep the question alive while you investigate for yourself.""

Don't you look back on a big lost world
Crying out <lj-cut text=""tomorrow"">tomorrow
Don't you look down like the heroes say
Come tell me all about it
Take me to the streets where the bonfires burn
Take me in your arms and I'll fade away
When I hear you say what you got to say
Anywhere you go, you know I'll still be waiting
All the things she said, she said
Little darling close your eyes, there'll be no compromising
Of all the things she said, she said

Throw me to the street where the heartbeats beating
""Beating all around me""
To the peaceful revolution
And the perfect wave, surround me
Tell me 'bout the ocean moving in slow motion
I see it glitter in the sun
Then it's freezing in the moonlight
Never look back, never look back, never look away

If freedom comes and goes, you know I'll still be waiting
All the things she said, she said
You've fought the fight so long, no surrender to temptation
Of all the things she said, she said

Stars will fall out for you
Luck will surrender
I'm calling out to you

Oh to be near you in the first morning light
I'd be with you, I dream about you
If I could leave here, I would leave here tonight
I'd be with you, I'd stay with you tonight
Tonight

Anywhere you go, you know I'll still be waiting
Of all the things she said, she said
When I look into your eyes, I see a new day rising
Oh all the things she said, she said
Through the eyes of love, and to never know what hate is
Of all the things she said, she said
She said, this is our time, she said, this is our place
This is the space my heart wants to be

either everything means something--
or nothing means anything...

i mean, is a cigar ever really <i>just</i> a cigar??
...and in weighing these things out, are you then a ""fence sitter""?
 --or are you ""in balance??""...

...so that got me again, to thinking of David Blaine, 
and how when that woman-- from one of his television specials that i saw many years ago--exclaimed ""How do you <i>do</i> that?!?""
 He blithely remarked...""It's not what you think. The signs are all around you always.""
...and if you look at that film clip-- you can see that he got his answer for her from the spray painted graffiti on the side door of a city taxicab that was ...coincidentally passing by.

Then r and i got to talking about business ownership and my philosophies regarding freedom. And he said something like ""i won't let the monkeys loose."" and i said ""WTF!?! Let them loose!!"" :D

I had to halt the convo at one point to merge in with traffic on Rte. 50. I was thinking how merging is always the most challenging part--but that ultimately it is a matter of making your intention known and then waiting patentiently until it is your time.

3 in a row from the car-- the accompaniment to the conversation...

They pulled in just <lj-cut text=""behind the bridge"">behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
""Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?""
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
CHORUS (SHE)
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries ""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?""
CHORUS (SHE)
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
""We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""
CHORUS (HE)
All night
He wants the young American
Young American, young American, he wants the young American
All right
He wants the young American
Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?
Have you have been an un-American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have
CHORUS (YOU)
All night
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry?
CHORUS (I) (repeat 3 times)
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American

I was on the #32 bus coming back to my hotel in Edgeham from a wonderful day of sightseeing in old town Antwerp. 

I was *so* enjoying the architecture and I was feeling very warm and glowy from my adventure in Antwerp and from the hospitality that I received from the citizens there... 

(i mean, i actually had a <i>map</i> and i kept getting <i>lost</i> on all those twisty little Antwerpian streets! So...every time i would get lost...i would stop into a shop, or ask a person on the street...who would willingly and pleasantly stop their day, and take their time to redirect this lost little girl...)

So, I was on the bus, on my way back, totally <i>in love</i> with Antwerp...
And the bus was <i>full</i>...it was the end of a work day. 

An elderly lady with gray hair and a tiny frame sat next to me-- and said something which i did not catch...so i smiled and said ""I am an American tourist...sightseeing your wonderful city..."" 

And she smiled and said ""Oh yes?... the bus is so full..."" I smiled at her again and nodded in agreement.

After a moment she said ""You are an American? Sightseeing?""...i turned to her and smiled again--looking away for a moment from my window of architectural eyecandy...""Yes. Yes."" i said, ""I am having a lovely time. I love it here. Everyone is so friendly.""

And she told me that she was happy that I was having such a good time...And she rode a bit of the way with me, and at her stop, as she went to get off she said to me ""I wish you happiness for all of your days.""

Now, Who could not <i>love</i> that??"

He said I was in my early 40's with a lot of life before me
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, looking at the X-rays
And talking 'bout the options, and talking <lj-cut text=""'bout sweet time"">'bout sweet time

I asked him when it sank in that this might really be the real end
How's it hit cha when you get the kind of news
Man, what'd ya do ?

I went skydiving, I went rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

He said I was finally the husband that most of the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin wasn't such an imposition
And I went 3 times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then...

I went skydiving, I went rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

Like tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about what you do with it
What should you do with it
What can I do with it
What would I do with it

I went skydiving, I went rocky mountain climbing

To the name of this town in a desk-top globe
Exit wound in a foreign nation
Showing the home of the one this was written for
My apartment looks upside down from there
Water spirals the wrong way out the sink
And her voice is a backwards record
It's like a whirlpool and it never ends

All alone at the '64 World's Fair
Eighty dolls yelling ""Small girl after all""
Who was at the Dupont Pavilion?
Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there?
Or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
To the horn on the pole at the bus depot
And in the back of the edge of hearing
These are the words the voice was repeating:

Where the world goes by like the humid air (world goes by)
And it sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks until it goes away (it goes home)
And the truth is, we don't know anything (don't know)

got a honey jar stuck on his nose...
he came to me asking help and advice
and from here no one knows where to go--

so i sent him to ask the owl if he's there
how to loosen the jar from the nose of the bear...

so help me if you can i've got to get back to the house
by quarter by one
there is so much we've got to get done...
count all the bees in the hive
two three four
chase all the clouds from the sky...

back to the days of Christopher Robbin & Pooh...</i>"

[ mood |  frustrated ] 


As a reviewer whose name is all over the net, I get lots of writers wanting me to read and review their books. I get free books and they get my opinion. Readers may or may not agree with what I write, but I stand behind what I write and that carries some weight.

Last Friday night a writer contacted me to review his book About Nursing Homes. I wanted to know how he found me (it's a good idea to know where and how people find you) and he told me. We got into a discussion and have chatted on AIM from time to time, like this afternoon. 

This man isn't much older than I am and he has had a rough year. He died twice after he was diagnosed with cancer and had a stroke. He was a quadriplegic in January 2004 and got out of a nursing home in June. Five days after he got out of the nursing home he met a woman online and he told her everything bad about him: broke, recovering from rehabilitation, twice married...the whole ugly truth of his life. She told him the ugly truth of her life. They were married less than one month later. 

He has a simple philosophy about marriage and love. He says people are like restaurants. When you meet someone you look at the menu and if you don't want to take everything on the menu you part and go your separate ways. When you find a menu that has everything you want and the other person finds the same in your menu, you've got a match. This is his third time down the aisle and the ugly stuff is out of the way. Nothing was hidden and they like everything on the other's menu. 

I know it sounds simple, but it also sounds and feels right. Too many people settle for less than what they want because they're afraid of being alone. To quote Mike, ""If someone really wants you [s/]he would eat his[/her] way thru a mile of horse shit just to see you. If [s]/he is married, he would say screw [him]/her and be with you now. There are three bad reasons to stay in a bad relationship: money, vows, kids."" 

He also said he was an asshole once upon a time, but he died twice and came out of it knowing what was and wasn't important in life. My hope is that those of you currently in difficult or impossible situations right now don't have to die to figure out what is important to you. Don't settle for less than what you want, need, and deserve. If you're in a bad situation, get out of it. Find a menu that has everything you want on it. And when you find it, get all the ugly stuff out of the way. It will only crop up later. Now is better than later. If the person truly loves you they will accept you in spite of the bad stuff because you're the right person for them, too. Don't waste any more precious time figuring it out. You know what you want; start chowing down and go where you really want to be.

Do you have to die to get it? I hope not.""

"event","There are moments in life when you miss someone
so much that you just want to pick them from
your dreams and hug them for real!

When the door of happiness closes, another opens;
but often times we look so long at the
closed door that we don't see the one,
which has been opened for us.

Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile,
because it takes only a smile to
make a dark day seem bright.
Find the one that makes your heart smile.

Dream what you want to dream;
go where you want to go;
be what you want to be,
because you have only one life
and one chance to do all the things
you want to do.

May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,
enough trials to make you strong ,
enough sorrow to keep you human and
enough hope to make you happy.

The happiest of people don't necessarily
have the best of everything;
they just make the most of
everything that comes along their way.

The brightest future will always
be based on a forgotten past;
you can't go forward in life until
you let go of your past failures and heartaches.

When you were born, you were crying
and everyone around you was smiling.
Live your life so at the end,
you're the one who is smiling and everyone
around you is crying.

Don't count the years-count the memories...


thanks cw."

"event","In Greek mythology, Narcissus was the gorgeous demigod who had no desire for intimate relationships but fell desperately in love with his own reflection. From his name comes the word ""narcissist,"" which refers to a person who is excessively self-involved, has an inflated sense of importance, and compulsively craves admiration. I've always suspected that Virgos are the least narcissistic sign in the zodiac. Many of you underestimate your self-worth and don't treat yourself with enough loving kindness. In fact, I sometimes get a mischievous urge to advise you to be *more* of a narcissist - like now, for instance. Here's an experiment I wish you would do: Spend 20 minutes in front of a mirror telling yourself how beautiful you are.

We Can Change the World

Though your brother's bound and gagged
And they've chained him to a chair
Won't you please come to Chicago
Just to sing
In a land that's known as freedom
How can such a thing be fair
Won't you plaese come to Chicago
For the help we can bring
We can change the world -
Re-arrange the world
It's dying - to get better
Politicians sit yourself down,
There's nothing for you here
Won't you please come to Chicago
For a ride
Don't ask Jack to help you
Cause he'll turn the other ear
Won't you please come to Chicago
Or else join the other side
We can change the world -
Re-arrange the world
It's dying - if you believe in justice
It's dying - and if you believe in freedom
It's dying - let a man live it's own life
It's dying - rules and regulations, who needs them
Open up the door
Somehow people must be free
I hope the day comes soon
Won't you please come to Chicago
Show your face
From the bottom to the ocean
To the mountains of the moon
Won't you please come to Chicago
No one else can take your place
We can change the world -
Re-arrange the world
It's dying - if you believe in justice
It's dying - and if you believe in freedom
It's dying - let a man live it's own life
It's dying - rules and regulations, who needs them
Open up the door
We can change the world

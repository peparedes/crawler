I'm not like greedy or anything it just seems weird is all. Right now we are snowed in at my uncles house in super-northern Maine. Everyone is in a shitty-ass mood, especially my gram.. oh hell especially everyone is more the fuck like it. There is like 2 feet of snow and it is still coming down. I finally got my Smackdown vs Raw 2006 for christmas like I hoped but I can't play it here and who knows how long we will be stuck here. Not that I didn't have a good time but with everyone contastly bitching it kinda ruins the mood. I'm currently using my moms laptop she got for christmas. Its pretty nice :) They are thinking about trying to leave now anyways.. It should be an adventure.. lol a long long adventure :o ... oh shit.. its freezing rain now.. fuck.. Oh well if I don't update when I get home then maybe I died. 

Wish me some fuckin' luck,

"event","I went to visit Meg yesterday.. It was a blast!! Of coarse I wouldn't expect any less from her lol. She introduced me to her new boyfriend Wolf. He has gotta be one of the coolest guys I have ever met.. Don't get me wrong I don't like him the way you are thinking I'm honestly happy for them. I also think they are gonna make it! I don't say that often about couples especially when Meg is involved because she is so unpredicable but it was this awesome vive I can't explain.. I can't wait to be a fucking brides maid at that wedding!! Wolf will you take the vamp for your wife!! 

Anyways they set me up with his friend they call Tuna for a blind date.. It wasn't a bad idea cuz I had openned my big mouth and asked for some men but you know how it is.. I'm not one to be picky about the guys I go out with and I know he was nervous but right off I could tell we just where not a good match.. Not that we fought or anything.. I still can't explain it.. But one things I can say for sure that bothered me that he smokes and I have had awful experiences with smokers.. My grandfather died of lung cancer, my brother smokes, and my dad smokes.. I don't want to see any more people who are close to me smoke.. END OF FUCKING STORY.

But other than the fact I will never go on a blind date again inless I get to ask a lot of questions first we had a really good time. First thing we did was go see a movie and then we went and got some pizza. Both Tuna and Wolf like wrestling so we all talked about that.. Poor Meg had no idea what we where talking about the whole time. I would once in a while stop and let them keep talking and talk to Meg about other things it was pretty funny. I only ate one piece of pizza cuz I had eaten a big lunch before I left the house and it was like 3:30 when we got the food. Luckily I didn't get hungry later so it was all good. Anyways after the pizza and long conversations we had nothing else to do so I piled them all into my car and I drove them back to job corps. 

When we got there Tuna got his guitar and we went to a room in the rec center so he could play for us. This other kid named Sam came and hung out with us.. He started moshing and goofing off like crazy. Before we knew it he found a steal chair and started doing flips onto it. and landing on some mats that I think where used for plays and stuff because we where behind the curtain of the stage. He completely destroyed the chair and the next thing we knew Tuna, Wolf, and Sam started wrestling. They wrestled for a long time and if they got caught they would be so busted considering the steal chair was in at least 3 pieces. They where doing some crazy shit to each other and holy shit wolf started bleading a little from the knee and the back of his hand. He knows Meg likes the smell of blood so he kept waving it in her face and I was suprized they didn't start a wrestling match. It was too funny. Naturally we finally hid the steal chair and ran away after someone hit Sam in the nose with the chair and he started fucking bleeding everywhere! It was pretty late at that point anyway so I left. Tuna asked if he could call me and naturally I didn't want to hurt his feelings cuz I do like him and everything but I would much rather have him as a friend. I told him to email me instead and he said he would try but I'm not so sure thats gonna work.. Damn how do I get myself in this shit? oh well whatever lol.

I did get done what I went to do.. Have a kickass time and check up on Meg. And lets just say shes doing 10 million times better than I am at this point. When I got in my car I told Wolf to take good care of her. I think he liked that cuz he laughed and said he would. And just for your info they call him wolf mostly cuz he looks like a wolf! lol :) I have no idea why they call Tuna, Tuna though.."

I mean I have been telling people I have had no regrets about anything I have done resently but thats not true. I mean I miss having friends who I can trust even if they aren't the worlds greatest friends I still trusted them and enjoyed being around them even though we where a bunch of fighting lunitics. 
Also I thought being surrounded by great musicians would be cool, and it is but I miss being needed like I was in Lisbon. They needed me then and they still need me now.. All they have is Tim, a freshman and some dumbass senior. he is no match for me especially sence he hasn't been in band sence my first year. Anyways I went after school for our first pep band rehearsal and I just lost it after Mr. Taylor pretty much told me I sucked in front of the whole class.. as if that wasn't bad enough right? I couldn't fucking stop crying.. It didn't hurt my feelings that bad but everything sorta hit me at once.. I miss my dead grandfather, I'm sick of being single, my brother has to have kidney surgery.. Hell I could go on forever but I just shoved everything away and pretended I was fine and nothing could ever bother me.. I guess that was a mistake cuz it all came out at once and let me tell you I NEVER EVER want that to happen again.. God that was awful.. I don't want to face anyone tomorrow maybe I will stay home sick.. shit I can't do that then I would have to tell my mom about it and I really don't want to.. Fuck it I will just go get fucked.."

I feel more lonely all the time but I would probably feel the same even if I was still in Lisbon.. I think I'm finally going through puberity..

I really should have asked him why but I didn't. What I really wish I could change was what happened when I left.. I said bye to him and we shook hands.. WTF is wrong with me? A FUCKING HANDSHAKE!!

"event","Luckily I was right about things getting better. I mean one person to talk to is nothing to really brag about but I think we are going to get close pretty fast. Her name is Sarah and she plays bass in the school band. We met the first practice and then the second one we started talking and goofing off.. Get this we where wearing the same pair of pants! lol!! She even said she wanted to join a band for like 4 years! Thats the same as me too haha!! I was talking to her friend who is drummer. She is very goth as well as Sarah and myself of coarse. She seems really nice as well so hopefully I will get to talk to her more too.

I can't say I'm too happy with everyone else though.. This one girl I am forced to spend time with cuz she is at my table in homeroom.. in half my classes and sits next to me in english. She is one of those weird people who at a first glance look like they might be nice but then is a total bitch and whines contantly. She seems to think I'm her friend or something cuz she vents on me like crazy but to be honest she scares me :/ Even though I probably scare her more!! haha!! I didn't plan on getting picky about people to talk to but she gets on my nerves!! She would make anyone want to slit their own wrists after listening to her talk long enough! lol oh well I mean at least she isn't complaining about ME.. Well to my face anyways!! Also the kid I met at camp named Brad is in my band class but he hasn't said anything to me or even made eye contact with me at all! He is an egomaniac asshole and its obvious cuz of his friend the preppy drummer girl and the football player he talks to the whole time. He definitly acts like he has something stuck up his ass.. And if there isn't already something up there I will plan on having it aranged!! lol :D

Also naturally Scotty has been on my mind as always but reality is finally starting to set in. Even though we are perfect for each other it will never happen. Its just plain impossible. But I will probably stay single for the rest of my life trying to find someone half as good as him.. I would be lucky to find that lol!! Oh well at least I have my music :) I emailed my friend Brian and asked him to send me the football game dates so I can drive down and stock him, Gwynne, and Joe. I wonder if Joe is as cute as always.. Ahh who am I kiding of coarse he is! lol :)"

I play my old CDs that I used to be so proud of myself for playing and it just seems lame now.. My CDs I really need to fill this void have already been packed because I didn't think I would reach a level like that. I only have a few challenging CDs and most of them are too challenging. I either get bored after a few songs with my easy ones or frustrated with the hard ones. I finally found one I can try to pull off one song at a time. It my Lamb of God CD. I memorized the tab and I'm listening to it now to get it drilled into my brain. I have pretty much got heavy metal, speed metal, and punk down pact but death metal and nu-metal need work lol. I was also trying to play Staind's faster songs but I have lost interest in that as well. I need to get my Rush CD back.. I need to suck up to Saige so she will let me burn her Led Zepplin CD..

The 27th is my ma's last day of work so that is when I'm leaving this evil town for anyone who wants to know. I have already started saying bye to my friends starting yesterday when I was invited to go to the beach with one of my former best friends Saige. We actually had a lot of fun.. Well at least I know I did. The weather was perfect and her dog was so cute and good! She got away a few times but she didn't even care she just laid down in front of us anyways! I'm like holy shit what kind of dog thats free lays right where her owner can see her? After I was going to play some songs on the drums for Saige then I remember I couldn't with the dog with us so she is supposed to call me today so we can do it. I haven't called Sam and I'm pretty sure Meg is still gone. FUCKIN CALL ME! Damn it I'm lonely.. 

Anyways now that that is off my chest.. I'm finally feeling a little better about the Scotty thing. I have been doing yoga everynight before bed and it still works good but it would work better if it wasn't for the fact I see his face every time I close my eyes to meditate. I bought a bunch of video games again yesterday so I would be entertained for the rest of the summer. I got The Sims, GTA Vice City, Star Wars Jedi Starfighter, and Star Wars Battlefront. Of coarse DDR is always around for very funny entertainment. Dispite the fact that I will probably never hook up with Scotty I at least know in my heart that it is possible for a guy to actually be somewhat perfect for me lol.

I used myspace to get in contact with some of the guys from camp. Only two have them have got back to me but I only cuz I could only find 3. Mike, and Greg are the ones and they are real cool guys. I didn't really get to know Greg at camp but after seeing his profile and stuff he is more than cool in my book. I did know Mike pretty well so I wanted to find him. We both said we where gonna work our asses off and maybe make the better band next year. But naturally I won't be sad if I get concert band with Scotty again!! lol The last guy who hasn't added me yet is a dissapointment currently. He seems like an asshole in his own superfishal way. He is a good drummer named Brad and the one who is from Newport where I am moving, but he pretty much admited he went to camp for the chicks and he said he made out with 12! What a whore.. I guess I can't blame the chicks cuz he is hot but he isn't any hotter then Greg. I assume Greg has a little more desency though. I would date Greg to be totally honest but I'm not in love with him like I am with Scotty."

I know the first week will be the hardest because he is still fresh in my mind but espeicially after we move I will be way to occupied to be depressed. But currently all I can do is try to block him out. Its not just Scotty I miss about camp believe it or not.. I miss the way the MCA looked when we had band practice.. You could see 1000s of red chairs on two levels and was build for music so everything sounds cool in it. I also miss Gwen and the jokes we had together. I miss playing percussion with the cute guys and trying to figure out if Amber is the kind of person I want to assiostate with. Doing yoga with Scotty and afterwards talking to Amanda about our Tuba metal band. I could go on for awhile but I will stop now.

I swear it on my gramps grave we would be perfect together.. his name is Scotty and he is the sexyist guy I have ever seen! I mean.. he doesn't look like Randy Orton but in some ways he is better! He has long black hair and always wears a bandana which is a huge turn on.. An even bigger turn on about him is his eyebrow ring!! *dies*

As you probably guessed he was one of the percussion teachers who is actually is a junior at the college that the camp is at. He likes rock music and is going to major in percussion.. *dies more* He has gotta be the most laid back person I have ever seen.. I must have lost my music a million times and he never freaked out! He even saved my ass by letting me borrow the score so the director wouldn't kill me. I am assuming the reason he is so laid back is cuz he does yoga. Hey don't laugh it is cool! He actually taught a class of it and naturally I think I was destined to take it. Watching him get in those streches was quite entertaining but I also learned a lot as well. I liked it cuz I actually could do some of the easier ones and it felt really good after working my ass off lugging and playing heavy instruments all day.

I had so much fun involving Scotty it was incredible. One time my friend Gwen who talked me into going there with her kept randomly shouting ""DON'T DO IT!"" At people. She did that to him and he gave us the eyebrow (the unpierced one) I about melted and then she kept doing it as he walked away and he kept turning about and his looks got more and more confused everytime. I about pissed my pants! He has the cutest facial expressions I have ever seen.. It doesn't matter what his face says it is always hot!! His confused look is my favorite but his grin when we sound good is a close second.

Now that I have like freaked out over Scotty I totally get what is going on with Meg and Rob. The only difference is she has a chance with her match and she needs to take advantage fast before someone else does first. Cuz having a match like that doesn't happen often at all. Before the last 2 weeks I didn't think there was a man out there for me and now I know different. It doesn't matter that I have to wait a whole year to see him again.. I know I will meet him again and when I do I promise in the name of my dead cat and grandfather I will be ready."

I was so pissed about a week ago my playstation finally kicked the bucket and I was having withdrawals! I was going freakin insane! So I finally gave in and traded it in for a referbashed one.. MY MISTAKE.. I take the damn thing home play it for 5 minutes and then it starts tweaking out! The next day I went back to EB and got the new one. To bad I will be in dept past my birthday :( I think it will be worth it cuz it works great, is mega small, and has the internet thing all ready to go! I can't wait to hook it up online but my dad is always too busy to do it so I just wait.. and wait and wait..

I watched the Star Wars trilogy in the past few days. A movie always seems better if you haven't seen it in a long time. Not to meantion I have it on DVD and at the end they changed Anakins ghost to look like he does in Episode III instead of that random middle aged guy they had before."

But maybe there will be less assholes at my new school.. lol :) Anyway I had to hold back tears because it was happy and yet I do have some important people that will still be here. I know that moving is what is right for me but I kind of feel like I'm giving up with only a year left..

The whole experince of today was pretty cool. I talked to Joe quite a bit and he even called me yesterday to find out what time to show up! My mom seemed more excited about it then I did though :o We went to get ice cream after and poor Joe was lactosintolerent, he got a slushie.. Poor guy.. Anyways when I was talking to him he gave me a cool idea as well, he mentioned me coming to the football games and I liked that plan. I figured that would give me a good excuse to show up and see him and the others. I also plan on stopping by for concerts :) I can't help but be curious about what Joe truely thinks of me. He is a huge sweet heart and doesn't treat anyone that I know of in a negative way. Its kind of hard to know what he truely thinks though.. I'm suprized he isn't a little avoident of me after the note with my email on it the other day.. I pretty much told him to call me if he wanted a date! Funny and yet completely serious.."

I just want to be free and maybe pick up a guy on the way. No one truely understands me anymore and I am definitly walking alone. I'm not totally against that but it does get lonely sometimes. 

This weekend was prom and I didn't have a date so I stayed home and cleaned my room.. I couldn't help but ask Joe if he had a good time and he told me he didn't and it was boring.. I'm not sure what to think of that. Oh well its not like it matters he is moving so I should forget about him. As hard as I try to I just can't.. I mean I'm not like every other chick who just likes him cuz he is cute I like him for other.. deeper reasons, ones I can't explain.. and stupid stuff like that. 

I guess I really should forget about the idea of love because I'm not the kind of person who will truely find it in another human being. The only things I will ever love is my computer, video games, mom and drums. No one will love me that I will like back.. Its just the way life is.. I guess I need to embrace what I have instead of what I don't have.. Kinda hard when I see hot men walking around all the time.. but life goes on I guess. But before my stupid dream ends I think I should put myself out there.. I mean I should like hint at him and see what he says.. If he doesn't like me then I will know I'm right.. and if he does ... SCORE :D lol Like that will ever happen!"

The whole day was just completely awesome! I was talkin' Chris and Dan in music lab and we decided to start meeting after school and play Metallica songs! It should be a blast and a hell of a good way to start a band. I can't say I like Dan very much but Chris is cool with me. If Dan doesn't act like an ass things will be great. I figure he won't be like he is when he's around certian people so it aughta be good.

The concert experince was the coolest thing ever. It was kind of pathetic I had to go to my first rock concert with my mom but it was totally worth it. We found out that the opening act was none other then the awesome band My Chemical Romance! I was totally pumped!! Before we even got to the concert we started goofing off and having fun. We went into this sports bar to eat and we watched pool and two lesbians play a triva game. I got this really weird pizza that was like grilled! It was quite good.
 
To put it lightly MCR was SO FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!! They where pretty bad ass concidering they are a punk band and I expected to see all the preps I saw in line run away! None of them did to my suprize and disappointment. When Green Day came on the place went completely crazy and I couldn't believe how great they sounded live. They sounded just like the album! Billie-Joe (lead singer/ guitarist) did this thing where he picked musicians out of the audience and let them play there instruments. When they asked for drummers I jumped up and down and yelled like crazy but I was so far back he didn't see me! I would have loved to have played Tre Cool's kit!! I also could have done way better then the dude who did it.. Anyway it was still amazing and I got a kick ass MCR tie!! I freakin' rock!!"

Not only did I stay awake in all my classes but I used a study hall I got in math for a homework assignment and then for like 50 minutes I continued writing a story. I also was like the only life form in my class to read the book for english! :o It was quite funny to be honest.

Whats even funnier is what happened to my buddy over vacation.. It wasn't a what did she do question.. It was a ""who"" did she do.. You can take a random guess and I will even help you his name begins with ""R"". She beat me to getting laid.. Damn you!! Lol I'm kidding I new she would!! I don't mind. I wanna get laid at ""Champain"" college ;) Anyways obviously a lot of goals have been set and accomplished with in the past few day and I personally think thats great.. But me and my best friend are totally going in opposite directions.. She's getting laid and I'm working my ass off. Hopefully it will all pay off in the end and in a few years I will be ""Paid, Laid, and Made!"" Just like Evolution used to be!!

One last thing to add.. Joe actually remembered I asked him to go to the Green Day concert!! I couldn't freakin' believe it!! He told me he was sorry he couldn't go but inside I was so happy!! I mean just knowing that after all this time he still remembered me made me feel like I wasn't invisable even to that sexy man!"

Free from all the b.s. school brings and all the drama and pain.. It will end and the friendships that go along with them. I'm sick of looking at the present.

Gramp is in heaven ""playing cards with the Pope"", I suffered though the wake and funeral and went to school for 4 days and then visited gram and my aunt and uncle this weekend. I think things will finally start to slow down now.. Its a huge relief but once things get less hectic this just might hit me hard.. But for now I'm keeping myself busy and my mind away from such depressing subjects.

An army recruiter came and talked to my band class on Friday. It was mega cool cuz I found out you can actually get a contract so you can't be thrown into battle whenever and get paid really good money to travel around and play music for a living. The only catches are you have to go to boot camp for 9 weeks and stay in really good shape or you get fired. I'm not so sure I can do that but maybe if I work out over the summer I could pull it off.. I guess I will have to think on that more.

Today is my moms bday and I actually had forgoten it! :o I need to get her something but I'm not sure what yet.. I don't know what I'm gonna do but I will probably think of something tomorrow during school."

In a way it is a relief to know that he is in a better place and is no longer suffering. I skipped school the last two days and I will skip Monday cuz of the funeral. I actually am getting over it I am just generally brought down cuz seeing my gramp die made me lose my untouchable feeling that I used to have.

I knew I knew I wasn't actually untouchable but I always felt that fate would protect me. I am no longer so sure of that. To get over it all I played video games for hours and hours on end. Being lost in the world of Final Fantasy X-2 made everything seem ok. One of my favorite characters called Paine says a lot of cool things. I wrote down lots of her quotes but one I like the best and remember the best is.. ""The hardest person to know is yourself"" Its true, ya?

I would actually be in good spirts but the fact that NONE of my friends called me to make sure I didn't die is bringing me down. I NEVER miss school and I did two days in a row! I even skipped a white day which I always tell people I would have to be dying in order to stay home from them cuz it is so hard to make up those classes.

But FUCK them! Cuz something like this really does show WHO your real friends are.. And the only true friend I have is myself.."

He caught namonia and he is in the hosbital now. My mom has been gone all the time taking care of him.

I did find out some good news.. I found out for sure Joe and Kristina broke up! That makes Joe a single man! He actually asked Kelley Curtis to the prom but she had to turn him down cuz she already has a bf. I thought about asking him myself but I'm not much of a dance person and I don't know if my friends are going to go or not.. But I did take my moms offer of asking him if he wanted to go to the Green Day concert with me. He told me he would ask his parents. If he says he can I am going to be so freaked! It will be awesome though..

According to Meg he kept looking at me in band today.. I think it was just a conwinadence or something but damn.. If it is true.. HELL YEAH :D !!!!!!!!! lol seriously though I don't think he was checking ME out.. It has always been the other way around!

Thinking about Randy didn't make me feel better and neither did venting on here. But I figure I should write just cuz I can. Lets see... My life is shit right now. Meg is being a psycho.. Gramps is in rough shape to put it lightly and my grades are slipping beause of the other two problems. All I want to do is hide from it all and pretend it doesn't exzist. With gramps I just can't.. and with Meg.. I think avoiding her will make it worse. She is being totally evil and taking everything out on me! I mean come on! I understand she is having issues but that gives her no right to push me around. I have enough of my own problems right now you know? Ugh I swear if she says anything else that ticks me off I WILL explode at her! I mean I know why she is doing it but she could at least.. I dunno TRY to control it.. Or maybe take it out on someone she doesn't like? Or on second thought maybe I am the person she doesn't like.. Hell if I know!"

You know being away from all the bullshit that comes along with comunication and stuff like that. I was pissed when I got there because there was this really hot dude there and then I found out he was my 3rd cousin.. DAMN IT ALL!!! He was fucking hot! Why did he have to be related to me?! Then he started talking about video games! I almost cried! I also brought Meg along with us for the trip. I don't think she had a very good time to put it lightly.. I probably shouldn't say this on here but I must say she didn't exzactly make the trip more fun for me.. Oh well whats done is done I guess. Its vacation and I'm mega happy about that. Hopefully everything will calm down now and stuff like that.

Weirdly enough I have felt really lonely lately. I have no idea why but I do. Its not just because of Ben my hot cousin but I have been just in general. Oh well I'm sure I will get it sooner or later."

I'm like a total psycho lately because of my anti-social tendencies. I still have been like hanging out with people and stuff but I dunno I just haven't been quite as happy about it. Why? I have no fucking idea! ...Creepy.. Oh well whatever. All I really want to do is curl up in a ball and play video games by myself for a really long time. Its just might be because of the fact that its Febuary and I really, really HATE Febuary.. Naturally because its valinties day soon and if there is one thing I hate its valentines day. I have NEVER EVER had a bf on valenties day and I have always been all lonely and sad. Its really stupid and childish but thats how I am."

I'm also kind of sad that I didn't make districts but I'm not like really pissed or anything because Joe didn't make it either so it doesn't matter. My mom said that if it was just us who made it she would volenter to drive us and make me sit in the back of my VW beetle with him! ;) Shes such a bad influence! Its great!

I figure its the best move for me at this point. I'm just trying to look out for myself instead of everyone else like I used to. I'm not saying I'm not there for my friends I'm just saying that I'm not sticking my nose in. I know I have probably been though all of this before but I really have nothing I feel the need to write at the moment. Yes bad things are happening with my grandfather and my friends and all kinds of other shit but like I said before I don't feel like thinking about it."

I mean everything bad is still going on but I decided that I'm going to stay bored and not get involved. I'm sick of all the B.S. going on around me especially when I try to help it will just spit in my face. I had district tryouts today and as I expected Aaron and Tim didn't show up! So my only competition is 2 other drummers! I did as well as I expected I would so I'm satified with it. The only thing that will deturmine weither I make it or not is the abilty of the other two drummers. Joe, Britney, and Ashely went also. We had a lot of fun on the bus rides because the bus needed new shocks and it was the bumpiest ride I have ever been on. On the way over they all looked like they were going to puke after but on the way back we were all so wound up after the audtions we all sat in the back and rode though the bumps and pretended it was a rollercoaster. They all laughed when I said ""This is just like a rollercoaster ride, just more painfull!"" Poor Joe kept landing on his nuts everytime and he finally started grabbing himself it was quite enjoyable :) What was also very enjoyable was before the bus left the school Joe bent over to put the guitar in the seat beside him and I saw his boxers! They had Snoopy on them and said ""Joe Cool"" I thought that was to perfect and funny! (Sexy too) Anyways I really hope Joe and I make it then I have a great excuse to spend time with him. I have actually got much more comfortable around him. I know it shouldn't matter because he has had the same girlfriend forever but damn it I want him!"

Joe got in trouble for lying which is really stupid because what kind of older brother would he be if he ratted him and Richard out! He got his guitairs taken away :( Poor guy *gives him a hug* And poor Richard to according to Joe he is grounded until fucking June! *Gives him a hug too* And now I'm out of a gig. Now all I have left is the bullshit I was hiding from all this time. I told everyone about it and how excited I was and now it was taken away from me just like that.. It was still great while it lasted but it still fucking sucks I lost it all."

"event","As my subject says even though my entries have been really happy and high sprited it isn't exzatly the whole truth. I mean yeah I'm in a generally good mood but thats because I'm hiding from my problems. Like my grandfather for instance is going to have radiation and I'm just trying to ignore it.. I know worrying won't fix anything anyways so I am just pretending its not happening. Also I think Meg is going though some problems but once again I know worrying about her isn't going to help none. I started thinking about it and honestly I don't think I can help her at all at this point. She doesn't believe I understand her but I think she is kind of overlooking me as far as that goes. I mean I don't know everything because I'm not a fucking mindreader but other then that I think I get her pretty well. I have tried to help her so many times in the past and everytime it just spits in my face. So as far as that goes I'm not going to be my normal self and stick my nose where it doesn't belong. I will just wait and see if she comes to me for help because I'm not sure if she really wants me bugging her about shit.

Joe didn't call me yesterday which kind of sucked because we were supposed to practice this weekend. He might call today but if he doesn't I think I know why anyways. I remembered yesterday that Richards amp is still broken and we wouldn't be able to do much with just me and Joe. (music anyway lol)"

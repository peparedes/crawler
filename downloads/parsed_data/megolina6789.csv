"event","there have been a lot of problems and feelings this summer. a lot of love. love is a feeling everyone is looking for. someone to make their heart beat a little faster and their stomach do some flip flops. sometimes love just seems to end in the wrong places. as you stand by your locker, nearly melting, praying he'll just give you the time of the day, he's off chatting with one of his close ""friends."" well as you know it takes two to tango and the stomach-flipping heart beating love just wont get off his ass long enough to dance with you. iv'e been there a lot and yes, i know, it sucks. but, just because this one in particular makes your heart beat at the moment, doesnt mean its going to stop once you find out he's taken. it means your going to cry, your going to get angry, and then one day you'll wake up and realize that your better than him and his bs and you'll get up and ifnd yourself a new dance partner. even though you've found a new dance partner doesnt mean this one will give you the best dance of your life. songs end and toes get stepped on in the process. soon enough, you will find someone who will dance with you and not step on your toes. someone who you truely love and who loves you back. and, until that day does come along, until you find ""the one"" just enjoy the ride. love like you've never been hurt before and don't ever stop dancing

"event","Well, its been a while. I was motivated by boredom and Wendy. She told me to update this shit, so I am. Yesterday I went to Kyle and Kenny's joint birthday party. It was a good time. I'm really not a party person and i dont like being large groups, but i liked it. I swam a lot. A lot with kushi, rach, hannah and some other people. T'was fun. The other week, I went to Kristen's B-day party. I swam alot there too. I guess a lot of my summer involves swimming. 

Things have been ok for me lately. Better since my last entry. Things are going to be alright and i've begun to relax a little. I still do nothing everyday and rarely leave my house. Regardless, its still ok. I'm still not as happy day by day as I wish, but eh..it could be worse..much worse. 

I need to start getting in shape for soccer, which I am actually playing this year. I know i'm one of the laziest people ever...so its gunna be tough...wish me luck...or ill punch you. =p

Well, thats about it for now.

Have a good one, folks.


Mikey, signing out."

Trent Reznor is angry at<span style=""font-style: italic;""> you</span>...and pretty much everything else as well.<br>
<br>
I've been addicted to Nine Inch Nails for some time now. I know its not
my usual style of music, but the music has really grown on me and the
lyrics are amazing. I know most of you have only heard ""Closer,"" but
that isn't one of my favorites. I love how fucking angst and sadness
driven every fucking song is. Seriously, this is some of the most
emotional music I have listened to. I don't even know why I am typing
all of this! It is 1 am on a Tuesday and I have that kind of time. <br>
<br>
This summer has sucked major goat ass on a whole. Not a shapely,
buh-dunka-dunk, goat ass, mind you. A horrid, smelly, rank goat ass of
sorts. I have had one or 2 good days. I still haven't spent enough time
with some of my good friends as I had hoped. Well there is still lots
of time...to stay home and wallow in my own self-pity and angst just
like Trent Reznor does. Oh well! Ciao.<br>

"event","It was a good weekend. I actually did....things. Because of the
occasion, I am going to write the stereotypical summary of the
weekend's festivities because I am that predictable. So here'goes,
kiddies!<br>
<br>
Friday was a good day. School was easy yet tiring. Big surprise there.
That night I was invited to go to the movies with Wendy and Sarah. It
was a really good time. I got to the point where I would go anywhere or
do anything because I just wanted to leave the house. We say Miss
Congeniality 2. I had never seen the first but this movie was actually
pretty entertaining. Wendy came over afterward and we just hung around
and watched some Who's Line and relaxed before she went home. A fun
night. Thanks folks.<br>
<br>
Saturday was another good day. (whoa...I actually had 2 good days in a
row. The happiness wasn't just raped and ripped to shreds as usual by
something crappy.) I hung around all day and did nothing. It was a
really crappy, rainy day so I decided to sleep most of the day away. I
slept until about 1:30 then emerged to greet the living. Later that
night I went to Kyle's house with Kenny, Hudak and Brett. It was a good
time. I never hang out with them anymore. We played some pool, went to
Friendly's and went back to Kyle's before I had to go home. A good day.<br>
<br>
Sunday was yet another good day, for the most part. (This has got to be
a record. 3 happy days in a row. Oh yes. *cherishes*) I wasn't
expecting to do anything today and just lay around like a slug but
Barbara thought otherwise. =p She invited me to the mall, which was
good because I had to buy a thing or two so it worked out alllll good.
It was a good time. Thanks, Barbara. ""I saw a flock of rabbits
today...er....a group..."" =p<br>

I don't know. He was hilarious and put smiles on so many people's faces with his odd sense of humor and creativity. A great man indeed.

"event","<P>Yeah, I don't know anymore. I was doing good in school for a while and I think i'm going downhill again. I actually had motivation to do work. I'm doing ok in English for once. I hate times like these because I have things on my mind all the damn time that just irritate me to no end and I have to get work done. The work never gets done. I just end up wallowing in my own self-pity and getting down about it. I wish I could escape my mind and my thoughts for like an hour just to hear silence in my brain once, not the constant chatter of random worrisome things. I get too ahead of myself sometimes and worry about the future too much when I should just wait and go with the flow of life. I just gotta wake up and start living like I fucking should and get out of this fog that im running though right now. Its fucking ridiculous... </P>

"event","<P>Nine Inch Nails. My gosh..I bought their album, ""The Downward Spiral"" and I have been nothing but hooked lately. Trent Reznor can convey so much emotion, almost rivaling Layne Staley of Alice In Chains, and probably more depressing. Amazing work. I also bought a Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains album. It's pretty cool. The songs are all very similar sounding and gets kinda of repetitive, but it's still rather good. I'll write more later. Comments?</P>

"event","<P>Last weekend and the beginning of this week have been pretty darn good so far I suppose. Most of it has been recently focused on my friend Rachel who I just can't seem to not love heh. I have talked on the phone with her almost every night for a week or so and my god, shes wonderful. =) She came over today after school and on Sunday. Thanks for everything, Rach. =) I had one hell of a busy weekend. On Thursday night I went out to eat with Miss Rachel and we chilled at my house for a bit. On Friday, I went to the all-star basketball games with the pep band, as described in my previous entry. It was an alright time I suppose. Thanks for the bagels Dave! The time-outs in the second game got progressively shorter so we decided to leave early, seeing as we could not finish one song with the time given. It was all good though. On Saturday, I was supposed to go to Boston with the Family to clean out my Grandpa's house but that ended up not working out. That night was Sir Kushi's B-day Extravaganza. It was a heck of a good time. I had fun chilling with people I dont normally chill with, so I really enjoyed myself. Swell times. Sunday was the parade in Holyoke. It was such a god damn drag. We waited around for 2 hours, waiting to start marching because the parade was so long. I was ready to fall asleep by the time we actually started. The parade was freaking enormous. Very long and slow and stressful, seeing as I never stop playing and my drum is so damn heavy. Anyone who wasn't a drummer forfeits their right to complain as instructed by me. I win. I sweated through my uniform I was working so hard. It was like 35 degrees out and I sweated through my uniform and a t-shirt. I win once again. I also received my first blister in a ages. Its all good though.</P>
<P>That is about it for now I suppose. Not much to tell about this week so far. It's only Monday.</P>

<P>Last night I went out with my good friend Rachel. We decided to go out to dinner at Applebees. It was a really good time. She's freaking hilarious. I payed for dinner, because I felt like being nice, and we went back to my house and hung out for a while before we both decided we needed to part ways to get some sleep. T'was a good night. Thanks, Rach. =)</P>
<P>I have a freaking busy weekend ahead of me for once.</P>
<P>Today is going to be a good day hopefully. I woke up at around noon, as usual on a weekend. Technically it is Friday but whatever. Tonight is a series of basketball allstar games in Turners that the Pep Band was invited to play at. It should be a good time. I believe Lauren, Katie, and Tyler are playing in them. </P>
<P>Tomorrow I have to go to Boston all morning to clean out my Grandpa's house with the family. That should actually be pretty fun because I will be breaking apart furniture with a sledge hammer. Fun times, if i do say so myself. That night is Kushi's B-day Party. That should be fun as well. In fact, today is his Birthday so Happy Birthday to Matt.</P>
<P>Sunday I have the Holyoke St. Patty's Day Parade to march in with the marching band. It should be fun I suppose. I like marching in parades because the people are always very appreciative. </P>

They happened to lose, which isn't very cool, but they should be proud to get as far as they did. Pep band went off without a hitch. Good times were had. I came home, ate lunch, and took a nap from 2-5. I was awoken by my cell phone ring. T'was Wendy! We went to 2 hockey games at the mullen's ice rink. It was a good time. It was also the first time I have&nbsp;done anything with any friends in 2 weeks.&nbsp;The second game was rather intense. There was a group of douchebag fans that were beyond irritating. I was debating whether to kill all of them or just kill a few and kill 1 or 2 just to set an example for the rest. I ended up choosing either of those, because there were small children in the audience. hehe. Nothing is going on tomorrow. I broke my school headphones so tomorrow i'm going to get another pair. I'm excited. Thats it I suppose. Comments? Maybe on the new backround I made? Until next time...</P>

"event","<P>I haven't been in the best of moods lately? Why? Many things on my mind and many things irritating me to no fucking end. I haven't been leaving the house as much as I used to, or hanging out with friends at all? Why? I don't know. No motivation to do just about anything. I'v just been huddled up in my room day after day, listening to massive amounts of music as I usually do and working on some artwork that I have had on the mind. There is nothing better than music. It keeps me going, no matter what my mental state.</P>
<P>What have I been up to lately? Let me sum it up in one word for you: nothing. I did nothing last weekend. Dances aren't fun. I'm not a fan of the music that is played nor am I a fan of dancing, so that was out. I went to Best Buy and met up with Aaron. We talked for a bit. Thats was my weekend. Its only tuesday of this week. So far, it has sucked. Nothing new. I ran my T-maxx for a good 2 hours yesterday though and got it&nbsp;running all fine. I&nbsp;finally got the thing to switch into 2nd gear, making it go about 20 miles per hour faster. Too many adjustments on that little bitch, lemme tell ya.&nbsp;It was fairly nice out too. I learned that I irritated Becka a lot, but thats ok. She forgave me. Apparently she could hear it over music, with her windows shut, inside her house. My T-maxx rules: </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.gonad.org/upload/images/image020.jpg""></P>
<P>Its snowing like a banshee AGAIN. Fuck snow, i swear to god. It fucking sucks. I can't bike, the one activity that I actually do outside. I actually have a group of people to bike with, which is different. I usually bike alone, which probably isn't the best thing. If i happen to impale my chest upon a fence post or something, I would have no one to pry it out of my chest cavity. Imagine my chagrin! </P>

I was sitting on the edge of my bed
Staring at the headlines on the paper
""Look at poor Gene Kelly
I guess he won't be singing in the rain""
You can take away my heroes
Can you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride

Take away my pain
I'm not frightened anymore
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

She was standing by the edge of his bed
Staring at the message on their faces
He said, ""What else can you do, babe?
I guess I won't be coming home again""
They just took away all my promises
Make them take away my pain

Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride

Take away my pain
I'm not frightened anymore
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

His final scene
The actor bows
And all those years
Are gone somehow
The crowd applauds
The curtain falls

I was standing by the edge of the water
I noticed my reflection in the waves
Then I saw you looking back at me
And I knew that for a moment
You were calling out my name
You took away my hero
Will you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Let the cold inside
It's time to let it rain
There's nothing left to hide

Take away my pain
I'm not frightened anymore
I'm learning to survive
Without you in my life
Till' you come knocking at my door..."

"event","<P>I haven't been writing in my Livejournal for a while. Why you ask? Not from a lack of time, or motivation really. Its been a lack of good things happening. This vacation has more or less sucked so far. Why? Well it actually wasn't too different from Christmas vacation to start with: I was sick. Until Wednesday. Wasn't very cool. I didn't do anything. Now, when I say i didn't do anything, thats what i mean. I'm not exaggerating a whole lot. I woke up Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday and sat infront of my computer for the entire day, only stopping for bathroom breaks and shower breaks. Not my idea of fun. No one has invited me to anything. I feel kinda left ou and out of the loop. I have crappy luck I guess when it comes to vacations. I'v had too much free time that i just wasted. I finally sacked up and got my T-Maxx out of the garage and went to work taking apart almost the entire thing, fixing about 40 billion broken or worn parts. I also brought my bike up to my room and gave it a tune-up before spring rolls around. It is now hanging on my bedroom wall. Yes, my bike is hanging on my bedroom wall. Why? I had free time. I had a big-ass steel hook. I had a wall. I found a stud. Needless to say, it's fucking useless, but it looks cool i suppose. </P>
<P>So anyways, Today rolled around and it was a damn good day. I'm actually very happy for once. w00t. My Mom, Dad and I traveled to Boston to pick up my car this morning. It was a good time. I got a free Tv out of the deal too. A rather big one, at that. I'll post a pic of my car later i guess. Its a land yacht. Its white and gigantic. </P>
<P>I went out to eat with Barbara tonight. She is the bestestestestestest hehe, but seriously, she was nice enough to surprise me with the gift of my own personal Single's Day as requested in my previous journal entry. She got me a card and chocolates and whatnot and I presented her with her birthday gift. T'was very nice. I had fun.</P>
<P>On the subject of Birthdays, Rachael's B-day bash is Saturday. T'will be fun. I'm on the phone with Brin Twin and have no more motivation so I'll go and leave you with a pic:</P>

"event","Nothing has gone right lately. When I say nothing, I mean nothing. The littlest things make me really mad or down. I suppose its no change than my normal routine. I just realize it more now. I'v become a hermit. I never leave my room unless completely necessary. Its a subconscious thing i guess. I just dont like any human contact most of the time when i'm at home. I live on this computer, talking to the usual few people, and every so often turn around to watch some tv or go to bed. I keep getting migraine headaches, which are probably the most unpleasant thing&nbsp;I have ever had to go through.&nbsp;I'm worried its a brain tumor or something, but i doubt it. I bet its just from stress and the constant buzzing of my computer's fans in my room or the tv. I can't wait till the fucking snow melts so I can go biking and get away from the bullshit of everyday life. Seasonal depression sucks."

<P>Well this weekend was a good one. Last week was freaking unbearable. We had a super lame field trip to the Umass Library. It was kinda creepy actually. In order to get the books I wanted, I had to go to the 24th floor with Jared. When we got there, and saw that it was this desolate large room with just rows and rows of bookshelves and not one person in the while floor, I couldnt help but think how easy it would be to commit rape or sexual assault up there. No one will hear any screams and yeah, theres a staircase and an elevator, but still, its hard to get down either of those. Why was i think about this? I asked myself that same question and i have yet to find out an answer. It also reminded me of the first scene in ghost busters when all the cards in the card catalog. Whatever. That field trip sucked ass.</P>
<P>Friday was alright. Jared came over after school to do the history project, which we never ended up doing. Oh well. We did our math homework and hung out. Later we went to Rachael's house with Kristen and her cousin Will as well. It was cool to meet Will. He's quite a character. All of us had a good time playing pool and air hockey, and just talking in general. Better then doing nothing definitely. </P>
<P>Saturday was my Brother's and my cousin Allison's birthdays. We went out to eat at Chili's and went nuts, ordering way to much and eating the crap out of the place. It was a good time. That night I went to Amy's house with Wendy, Nelly, Sean and Aj to watch some horror flicks. We saw Psycho and The Exorcist, both of which were very good. I really liked Psycho though just cause Norman Bates was so damn creepy and I tend to like creepy characters. We ordered chinese food and just had a good time in general. T'was a good time. Wendy was nice enough to drive me to and fro. Go her.</P>
<P>Today was the infamous Superbowl Sunday. I'v followed the Pats this whole season so it was cool to finally see them in the superbowl. They triumphed once again. Good for them. They kick ass. I did nothing all day, stayed home, watched the game, ate 5 bagels, and played some Counterstrike. Another day gone in my absolutely, freaking spectacular action-packed, breath-taking life.</P>
<P>This week is going to suck. Period. A math take home project thingy, a history project, jazz band and 2 pep bands. Not fun. Hopefully i'll do something really fun next weekend. Who knows.</P>
<P>Until next time,</P>

"event","<P>It was pretty damn good. It could have been better, yes, but hey, I suppose they could always be better. On Thursday night, I had pep band. It went alright. T'was a good time as usual. Friday was an alright day. I had planned on going to the movies with Miss Wendy that day, but she ended up being sick. I was kinda bummed about that but Kenny was nice enough to invite me to the holyoke mall along with a whole bunch of people. It was a good time. That night we all ate at Chili's and went back to Kenny's for some Halo. On Saturday, Kushi came over for a bit in the afternoon before I had to babysit. Babysitting went well, as usual. It was the first time I babysat in quite a while. Today was boring. Its freaking crazy how many people are sick and how lucky I have been. *knocks on wood* My dad was actually sick, which he never is. Not cool. Even some teachers have been out sick. Not good times in Hadley, health-wise. This upcoming week will be a fairly busy one. I'm pissed that I have a pep band gig on the same day I have my drum lesson again. I'm sick of not eating dinner on those days. Whatever. Pep band is fun, so i guess i shouldnt complain too much. It'll be worth it. I talked my parents and they agreed to let me move my computer up to my room, which I am happy about. I'm sick of being down here when my dad practices trumpet and him being about 4 ft. from me at all times. It'll open up the basement as well. Good times.</P>

"event","What a simple week. I'm kinda glad this week was so easy, not just because I hate school with a freaking passion, but because we had exams last week and its good to kinda ease into the full school-day mode again. This'll be a short entry, i can tell.

Monday and Tuesday were the same as normal: They sucked. Nothing new, eh? Tuesday was stressful. School, a drum lesson and then pep band which meant no time for supper in between. Its all good.

Wednesday was a snow day. I slept until 2. Yeah, thats right. 2. Nothing happened that day. 

Today was Thursday. The day went fine, nothing exciting as usual.

I really dont know why I write in this Journal anymore. I dont write about anything interesting anymore. Its all just about my week. Lame, i know. Oh well. Maybe i'll be inspired eventually and actually start writing something creative. 

Until next time,

<P><STRONG><U></U></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P>God, that makes me happy. By Friday i was damn sick of it all. I can't believe it, but i was getting sick of half days. I'm left with too much free time and i have no idea what to do with my time and it pisses me off because i feel like i waste it. Its all good though. I did my usual gig, with sitting infront of the computer all the time and talking to the normal people, Wendy, Lydia and Barbara. Anyways, here's how the weekend went for me.</P>
<P>On day 1 of the week, which was a Tuesday, I had english and spanish. This was probably my hardest day. Spanish was run of the mill. Easy, but time consuming. English was a different story. I kinda screwed myself over by not reading the&nbsp;stories as thoroughly as i should have, but oh well. I ran into Plette in the hallway and she told me I did good on my essay on the exam. That makes me happy because i completely BS'd the entire thing and made it 3 pages long somehow..Go Mikey. Day 2, which was wednesday, I had gym, home-ec, history, and environmental science, all of which pretty well suck ass. Home-ec went bad, but its not like that class actually mattered. History was acceptable, considering I didn't study. But keep in mind, <STRONG>I didn't study for any of these exams.</STRONG> Yeah, thats right. I didn't do bad either. Go Mikey, go Mikey, Go! Thursday was algebra and jazz band. Algebra was alright. I only didn't know how to do one problem, which is fine with me. Jazz band was the highlight of the week. Mr. Forman's layout for the jazz band exam is he gives us new songs, we have 15 minutes to learn them as best as we can, and then we play them all together. We played a song called Brick house, which i'm sure some of you have heard of. ""Shes a brick *trumpet part* house."" Yeah. Whatever. That went well, as the other did. Today was the final day of exams and was a quarter day, which is cool. I love the friday at exams because I have band and chorus, which makes it the easiest day for me ever. It went well. I brought my accordion into school to show Forman because he is such a polka and accordion master. He told me that it was in tune and in good shape for its age. The thing that surprised me most was that he told me that it wasnt a full size accordion, which is amazing, because it already weighs 25 pounds or so. He played a song or 2 for and Dave. It was awesome. Forman is a good guy.</P>
<P>To sum it all up, the exams sucked..yeah..they did, but i didn't expect anything more then pure suckage, so it wasn't a surprise. I think I did alright. w00t. I'm glad its all over.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To get off the subject of school, we had pep band Tuesday, Thursday and today. All of it went well. It was good times as usual. Wendy was nice enough to invite me to a Umass Hockey game tomorrow night so i'll take her up on the delightful offer. Should be a good time. Theres nothing like giant guys slamming eachother into walls on a sheet of ice, holding wood sticks. Good times. I'm looking forward to a nice relaxing weekend. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'v been listening to a lot of comedy lately, thanks to inspiration from Brad. We talk about comedy all the time in pep band. Mitch Hedberg is still my favorite. He's hilarious. Download anything by him. You won't regret it. </P>
<P>To finish, i'm going to include a picture, like I have been doing lately. Its a good tradition i suppose:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On Saturday, Barbara came over for a while. It was&nbsp;a good time because&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't see&nbsp;her for&nbsp;quite a while. It was&nbsp;fun to catch&nbsp;up on&nbsp;old times and to finally exchange Christmas presents.&nbsp;She's awesome.&nbsp;That night&nbsp;myself, Wendy, Sarah, Jared, Kristen, Sarah, Rachael and Carol went to All Fired Up for dinner and to see the Ha Ha Sisterhood, an improv comedy act. They were booked for dinner for the night so we went to Primo, then return to All Fired Up and watch the show. It was pretty funny. It was a lot like Who's Line Is It Anyway, which is my favorite show so it worked out well. Jared slept over that night. We had a good time laughing at the most random things as usual.</P>
<P>On Sunday, Wendy was nice enough to invite me to a Umass Women's basketball game. It was a good time. Monica was participating in a game at halftime so it was cool to see her do that. Her team won. w00t for her. I hung out home alone pretty much the rest of the day and watched the Patriots completely own the Colts in ever aspect of football. </P>
<P>We had monday off, as you know. Chris, Nate and Jared came over and we jammed for a while. It was a good time. Its been a long time since i have actually played with anyone just for fun, besides my dad. </P>
<P>Today is Tuesday. You know that means. A week of exams and half days. <EM>woo.. </EM>Today actually wasn't too bad. I thought it was. Spanish and English. The exam for english, which I expected to be super tough, was actually easy. w00t. History and Gym/Home Ec tomorrow. Wish me luck.</P>

I worry too much and it makes me so depressed. I'll talk about my weekend some other time. I'm not in a good mood. I hate mood swings.







I was sitting on the edge of his bed
Staring at the headlines on the paper
He said, ""Look at poor Gene Kelly
I guess he won't be singing in the rain""
You can take away my heroes
Can you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride

Take away my pain
I'm not frightened anymore
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

She was standing by the edge of his bed
Staring at the message on their faces
He said, ""What else can you do, babe?
I guess I won't be coming home again""
They just took away all my promises
Make them take away my pain


Take away my pain
Leave the cold outside
Please don't let it rain
Don't stumble on my pride

Take away my pain
I'm not frightened anymore
Just stay with me tonight
I'm tired of this fight
Soon I'll be knocking at your door

His final scene
The actor bows
And all those years
Are gone somehow
The crowd applauds
The curtain falls


I was standing by the edge of the water
I noticed my reflection in the waves
Then I saw you looking back at me
And I knew that for a moment
You were calling out my name
You took away my hero
Will you take away my pain

Take away my pain
Let the cold inside
It's time to let it rain
There's nothing left to hide

Take away my pain
I'm not frightened anymore
I'm learning to survive
Without you in my life
Til you come knocking at my door..."

"event","<P>The weekend was a pretty good one. I have nothing better to talk about so i'll just do a play by play:</P>
<P>Friday: School sucks. Nothing new there. At 6 or so, I had a basketball game to play it. It went fairly smoothly and was normal. I ended up doing nothing after the game and just going home and vedging as I usually do in front of my computer.</P>
<P>Saturday: This was a good day. I hung around all day, hoping to do something in the afternoon before I was going to the movies with Wendy which we had planned for before hand. I finally saw Hudak and Sean's away messages and invited myself to go sledding with them at hartsbrook because I am rude and have the audacity to do such a thing. Go me. It was a good time. I brought my snow bike and Eric came with his snowmobile. I took a few laps around the fields with it. Good times. I arrived home at about 5, took a shower then it was off to the movies with Miss Wendy. We saw White Noise. I dont even know what to think about it. It was very bizarre but it was enjoyable. We met up with Jared, Kristen, Rachael, Kyle, and Emalie after we came out of the movie. Kyle, Jared and I decided to sleep over my house so that happened. We had a good time. </P>
<P>Sunday: Nothing happened. Kyle and Jared went home. Blah blah blah. I'm really tired.</P>
<P>I really hope this week is an easy one. Why this week, you ask? Well I say that every week so whatever. I already know it might suck a lot, just because I have english 3 times this week. Oh well. We'll just have to see, won't we? I hate how the weekend seems to go by so fast and the week so slow. Yes, i realize that the week is 3 days longer then the weekend, but still, its kinda ridiculous how slow it seems to go for me. I know why though. Its because I hate school with a passion and it has to go super slow and annoy me the most it possibly can. Anyways, i'm done ranting....well not really.</P>

I was hoping to maybe be social this vacation. That hasn't worked out. I'v just sat home infront of my computer, blew my nose, coughed like a mother fucker, and watched tv. Boring? I'd say so. Anyways, New Years was a big waste of everyone's time. Its just a number. Nothing is actually changing. I guess im being this bitter because I was too sick to go out and party with my friends, goddamnit. I just sat home and played Halflife 2. It made the time go by pretty fast, which I was happy about. I got phone calls from Wendy and Sam and that cheered me up. Today I woke up, hoping to feel better, and did a little bit, but i'm still sick. Woo..hoo. Thats it.

!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!:

After about an hour after I wrote that ^, Wendy and Lydia called me up and they wanted to stop by and see little ol' me. I, of course, didn't mind one bit. It was a good time. We hung out, listened to some music, played some pool and just chilled for a while. It made my day. Thanks folks. Thats about it.

"event","Yesterday was a rocking day. I woke up at around noon and went outside and tried out the snow bike. Surprisingly, it works super well, even in my yard which isnt very hilly. I can't wait to kill myself on it on an actual hill. I shoveled the driveway afterwards. It was fun because I used my new headphone earmuffs. They kickass. After that was done, my Dad and I decided to go offroading out back with his truck. My nextdoor neighbor owns the land he's in Florida so we took advantage completely. We had a good time navigating the trails.

Onto the night time.

It was a great night. I went to the movies with lots of people. Look at Sarah's livejournal for the list of people. I'm too lazy to type it out. Wendy, Lydia and I exchanged gifts. Wendy got me a kickass necklace and Lydia got me a bag of candy and a gift certificate to Applebees because she knows i'm fat. ;) Wendy's parents were nice enough to give me a ride to the mall along with Kyle and we went and saw Meet the Fockers. I thought it was really funny and I enjoyed myself. Good flick. I never saw the first one though so I can't compare the two. After the night was over my Dad drove Wendy, Lydia, Rachael and Kyle home. On the way home from the casa de wendy, our last stop, my dad was talking to me and gave me some advice that I really liked:

""If I can give you one word of advice, its this: If you have an urge, do it within reason. Your goal in life should be to never look back in your life and say 'Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda.' You should take risks and deal with the consequences because you are smart enough.""

Yep so I went home, talked to Lydia and Wendy for the rest of the night and played some Counterstrike until about 2. Thats it. w00t.


Mikey, signing out."

"event","Well it's Christmas day everyone. T'was a joyous day. I celebrated the birth of Jesus but doing nothing to celebrate his birth. I was given gifts, and received them. Now maybe there is some long story that I dont know that involves Jesus and gifts being given to him, but since I have never been to church, i'm oblivious. Next time i'll just shut up. I was woken up by my dad at around 9 and my brother and I headed downstairs. A very rough list of what was received:

-Drum heads
-12 pairs of drum sticks
-Ride cymbal
-Pc speakers
-Lots of Bod cologne for to smell like a sex machine
-Batteries
-2 pairs of headphones
-Some small weights for to get buff like Fabio


Thats pretty much it. I'm really in love with my drumset now. It sounds awesome. The new heads did the trick. Coated heads own clear heads.
So yeah, the family chowed down on ham and potatoes and clogged are arteries real good and it was a successful, fun holiday.

I'm going to Boston with the Fam for to visit relatives and to exchange gifts. Lydia is coming tomorrow also. I'm happy about that. She's cool. Good times for all. God, I love vacation..



A Merry Whatever You Celebrate!"

Saturday was insane. My dad woke me up at about noon and we went to Dynamic Percussion to see Art Benson and carouse the drum stuff there. What a great store. Anyways, I went into the cymbal room and was playing around with some interesting cymbals. I started playing this one that I really liked. A Paiste Signature Series Full Ride. I was telling my dad how I really liked it and whatnot and he asks, ""You want it?"" I was dumbfounded, but of course I did. So that day be bought me that cymbal, a stand and all new heads for my drums. The cymbal itself was $320. But shh...its for X-mas so don't tell me about it. I dont know yet. ;)

Sunday was the day of our school concert. I was really excited to go, which is probably the first time that has ever happened. The Jazz Band was super fun as was the Chorus. A good time was had by all. It didn't seem all that long either, which is good.

School was canceled today because of the snow. I'm happy. Good times. Only one day 1 this week! Yus!

Saturday started normal, with me waking up at about 1 in the afternoon. Sleeping late is the best thing...ever. 
Wendy was nice enough to invite me to go ring the bell infront of the mall for the Salvation Army. That was a fun time, except for the weather being kinda gross. We had some good laughs making fun of people walking by. Good times. I felt special being a non-promerito person.

Today was bearable. I went to the mall with my mom and went Christmas shopping. I also got a haircut. Hense the picture:

Iv only known a few Pantera songs over the years and I was never really in love with the band, but when tragedies like these happen, i just cant help but listen to them, thinking of what they could have been and had been.
In case you didn't know, Pantera's lead guitarist, ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott, was shot in the head and killed at a concert that his recent band Damageplan was playing at. Some nut ran on stage with a gun and unloaded, killing Darrell, and a few audience members and security personnel. Its a real same. Concerts aren't going to be the same again, i'm sure.

I was working on homework and talking to people, my normal routine, as most of you know. I got a headache. Nothing new. I'v been getting billions of them lately. I didn't let it bother me, the night went by and I went to bed. This morning I woke up with a migraine headache. Again, nothing new. These have happened in the past. My god, do they suck. My mom told me to go back to bed. So I did. My dad woke me up around noon and asked if I felt any better. I did and I told him and he says, ""Alright, you're going to school."" So, it being noon already, I was thinking ""Score! Easy day."" I took a shower, got my stuff together, and headed off to school. I got there and signed in a little before 1. Yes...1:00. My dad made me go to school at 1:00.....when school ends at 2:00. Oh well. I didnt mind at all. Mr. Foreman was proud of me because I basically came in for band class. Points for Mikey!

Tonight I went to our first Pep Band gig of the season. T'was a girls game. They won. Good for them. It'll be a good year.

We worked on our snowbike project for the first time. For those who don't know, a snowbike is basically a bicycle with Skis instead of wheels. We spent most of Saturday working on it as well. My dad brought Jared and I to his machine shop and we got to work with him on some cool machinery to help fabricate some parts we needed. This was the result of all the stuff:

I also tried Red Bull for the first time that night. NEVER DRINK THAT STUFF!! It tastes horrible. Ugh...

Yep. I decided to go the semi. My dad randomly left and my mom was away for the weekend so it was a mad dash to try to find a ride. It was around 9 when I had pretty much given up on going. Barbara was nice enough offer me a ride to the Semi finally. Very nice of her, considering she lives a good 20 minutes away. Thanks again! =p   

The Semi was an alright time, surprisingly. I danced with a few people and talked with muh friends. All in all it was better then staying home alone all night."

Well this week and the last weekend have been pretty entertaining, as well as stressful.

Last Sunday I went to a Patriot's game with muh Daddy. It was a fun time. We were next to some really funny guys who were making fun of lots of people in the crowd. How I love laughing at other people. The Patriots ended up winning an exciting game. Oh, did I mentioned it rained?....the entire time? Yeah. That was the only drawback. It never stopped raining. We had our ponchos, but those were basically just rain gutter that led all the water to our pants, which were drenched by the end. It wasnt cold, so it was bearable, just uncomfortable.

Tuesday I had pep band rehearsal and a drum lesson. Both went well and were fun. Nothing new, same ol' weekly deal. I'm boring, I know.
Today I had jazz band. I'll be playing 3 songs for the concert. It should be a fun time, as usual.

I'v been sooo stressed lately. I can't wait till the damn weekend so I can sleep for 18 hours a day and kick back and relax. Anyone wanna hang out this weekend?"

"event","Its funny, really. Does anyone actually give thanks? The only Thanks i have given today is to my mom for the wonderful meal she prepared. Go her. Other then that, nothing. I thanked my dad sarcastically for beating me at pool. Does that count? I feel like i'm a disgrace to Thanksgiving. Whatever. I think to much about it. Thanksgiving is about nothing but lots of eating and talking with family, which I find damn good, don't you? 

Lets go back a few days, shall we? We shall indeed.

This week started off pretty good. A three day week, the third of which being a half day. Tuesday was the only stressful day. Wednesday rocked my socks. A half day, and a day 2. Good times. Jazz band class was the highlight of that day. Tyler told us that since the periods were shorter we had to play all the songs faster, to make up for the time we are losing. Alright well, we played all the songs super fast. It was intense. Good times though. That night I hung out with Wendy and we watched Napoleon Dynamite and played lots of pool. I triumphed, though it was a tough fight. 4-3. Good times.

So yeah, today rolled around. I woke up at noon or so and my neighbors came over and spent the day with us. They are good people. We ate at around 2 I would say. God, I love food. Nothing is planned for the rest of the week. 

Mikey, signing out.


P.S.: Everyone's mood should be Thankful, it being Thanksgiving and all. If it isn't, I will be forced to destroy thee!"

"event","When love that is true,
comes into your life.
It changes you.

All ideas of what love was before are erased.
All pain of the past was worth the experience and the journey,
just to reach this point.

Someone worthy of the gift of your soul and heart,
and life,
and devotion.
And total trust and belief.

Nothing can compare.

What joy and sunshine,
and to be loved the same.

I'll need a miracle to help me this time-
I heard what you said and I feel the same-
I know in my heart that i'll have to change

Nothing's impossible
I still believe in love at first sight
Nothing's impossible

How did we get to be this far apart
How did we get to be this far apart
I want to be with you
have something to share
I want to be here i'm not there

What is wrong with me that I can even think that?
I know it will never happen,
I know you are gone forever,

days and months go by,
you still occupy my thoughts.

I missed it.
The last oppourtunity to ever hear your voice again.
I missed it.
I never knew it would be the last time.

"event","Dammit.
It's beena week since I hurt my knee again. It's not really getting better-- I'm worried about permanent damage. It's a freaking rip off all the way around.  Just  when The studio is almost done so I can start slamming artwork.  I'll get up in there and work on artwork anyhow- I don't need my knee for that--but it's a bitch with the stairs.  Too, I cant do my regular walking and exercise.  No pushups?  Try doing them in any manner with one leg.

I'm addicted to the exercise. I need it.  Stress relief and general well being.  I haven't been depressed in a while, and with the working out I can forgo much of anything negative.
It all affects the things I can do that have nothing to do with  if I even HAVE legs.  I can study and do my  art.  But I need the balance in order to do all of it well.  Winter is comming and I see some patch of  ice with my name on it  :(  This year,  I hate winter.  I dont want to deal. 

Duck fucker.  =P

You know,  I can handle just about any challenges life throws my way.  But comon.  This is dirty pool.  I guess if it was something I didn't feel bleak about it wouldnt really be a challenge.
How are you supposed to keep your ass nice if you can't really exercise it?

Problem solving;  Step one:  identify  the problem.  List all possible solutions,  including the ludicrous to loosen creativity.

BAH--boo hoo.  Action comes after a big dose of ""poor me"".  It's a bitch when you DO plan and  work towards things to have to pick out the monkey wrenches.

"event","""There are moments in our lives, there are moments in a day, when we
seem to see beyond the usual - become clairvoyant. We reach then into
reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the
moments of our greatest wisdom.
It is in the nature of all people to have these experiences; but in our
time and under the conditions of our lives, it is only a rare few who
are able to continue in the experience and find expression for it.
At such times there is a song going on within us, a song to which we
listen. It fills us with surprise. We marvel at it. We wouild continue
to hear it. But few are capable of holding themselves in the state of
listening to their own song. Intellectuality steps in and as the song
within us is of the utmost sensitiveness, it retires in the presence of
the cold, material intellect. It is aristocratic and will not associate
itself with the commonplace - and we fall back and become our ordinary
selves. Yet we live in the memory of these songs which in moments of
intellectual inadvertence have been possible to us. They are the
pinnacles of our experience and it is the deisre to express these
intimate sensations, this song from within, which motivates the masters
of all art.""

I know now that caffiene and lack of sleep  lead me right into being depressed.  I can go a couple of days without penalties, but, any more than that I can get really  bleak. AAAnd, of course all this week i've been drinking Tea and coffee to help me get alot done.
The good thing is,  knowing it helps to temper it.  It will pass. As long as I dont make any final, life altering decisions, all will be well.

After what  i've been thru the last few months,  there's been big change.  I'm calm.  I never realised I carried  drama and excitiability from  music and the stage into real life.  It was a big part of my personality. Lol. I'm glad that it is gone. I don't have room or desire for all that garbage in my life.  It's better to be calm and patient.  Impatience,  that's alot of what it was.  And,  whatever will happen will happen. I can't change people and what they  think, or what they decide to do.  Not caring so much,  being detached.  At least for now is fine. I have faith that the person I am, will not lose the important things, the good things thru change.  It is not in my desire or my  nature to be bitter and spiteful.

Art school spoiled me. Where else can you push the envelope so far?   I had such a blast there. Drama?  Cram hundreeds of temperamental Artists into one building and check out what happens.
I remember throwing a fit in life drawing one day.  Couldnt get the work to do what i wanted.  Threw my stuff accross the room, knocked over the easel, walked out. LOL, wasnt really that upset, just wanted to see what would happen really--not a word was said.  EVER.  And OH did I play up the scene as I stormed thru the room.
Walked into one classroom another semester, plopped my feet up onto the teachers desk, his chair.    He walked in, raised his eyebrows, and continued on like it was the most normal thing in the world.  LOl. God I loved that place.
One semester,  I didn't show up for the first two weeks of school.  Got all A's in my classes.  Except photography,  he refused to budge cause  I didnt pay enough attention to HIM.  I started experimenting with the film right away,  in the dark room, everywhere. He didn't think I foloed procedure enough.  He was right,  I told him so--but, boy that B burned me more than anything else.  (he didnt know I was afraid of the dark and the  darkroom  was hard for me to overcome  =P)

People with Mohawks, piercings, multicolored hair, painted faces, leather, music,  costumes in the middle of the school day--just because. Lots of fun and open minded people.  The teachers were so cool.  I'd love to  accomplish stuff just to validate how much faith some of them had in me.

Someone nominated me for who's who in junior colleges.  I got it. I still to this day dont know who did that.  No one would ever let me know.   :(     I should look some of them up.  Go visit the school. Being accepted for,  and liked for, who you are is the best  gift anyone can ever give you."

"event","It's hard to understand.
Why people choose freely to be evil and mean,  to cause pain to others.
We ALL go through pain.  And feel pain  acutely and deeply.
Why,  knowing this, knowing how it feels, would someone want to inflict that on anyone else?
Some people actually get great pleasure hurting someone else. Finding  vulnerablilities and exploiting them.
What could  have happened to someone, that they can justify that?
I understand that  some persons are actually born defective. Pathological. Some are abused. 
But,  that doesnt explain those who know, and choose to not care.
How can you expect to go thru life with no retribution?  That it wont come back to you?  That, no matter how you believe, or feel,  That just by being that way to others, if nothing else, you will cripple your ability to trust.  If you cannot trust, there is no love.  And you will kill all good things to fufill your own predictions of the  negative way things are. 
What you do to others, becomes your curse. Your living hell of knowledge.

You cannot escape yourself.

I think the big mistake is to try to understand.  At least past a certain point. Understanding does not change the fact it is wrong. 
I tried to understand someone  so much it was killing me.  It was messing with my head. It made me horribly insecure and unsure of how to be.  It was dragging me down- into their negativity.
The only understanding that can occur is within the person themself. And usually only after great pain so they will have to face it.  People like this will push it  til there is no where to hide from truth. Life will become more and more narrow, empty, dark and painful.  They will lose more and more.  They will squelch what does not desert them.
They do not understand unselfish acts. They can only judge by the empty coldness inside themselves that they live with everyday.  That is hell.  That is utter lonliness.

And I would never wish  this on anyone.

It is not power to hate.  That is easy and childish. It is a strong emotion, but, it lies.  Like drugs lie.
Power comes with responsibility.
To choose what's right. To choose. 
It is responsibility  and  power when you can crush someone, easily,  and don't.  When you can spot their innermost vulnerabilities- and leave them alone. When you could be rude,  and choose to help.  When you come out of yourself and are nice when all you might want to do is hurt someone.
That is all great strength.
To  allow some asshole another day of existance, so they might learn from thier mistakes.

It is easy to react like an animal.  It feels good.  But it is no accomplishment and means nothing.

We are here to learn.  Suffering  in life is  proportionate to  the level of learning we are not doing.  The thicker the  head, the harder the thump has to be to get thru.


Like an alchoholic, or other substance abuser, the only one who can help someone like this, is themself.  And usually,  they have to lose everything, have nothing but the misery they  chose for company, before they see themselves for what they really are.

Facing truth is liberation. Self delusion is death.
Choosing the easy way is death.

We all have ugliness inside us.  To not see  it is to cripple and imprison ourselves. Only those things we are blind to trip us.  Only those fears we do not face are those that own us.  Fear is powerless unless you give it permission. We are both the ugliness and the beauty that we see inside.  Our dreams are meant to be fulfilled, but cant be when we are crippled. Then our dreams are there to haunt and taunt us.
The first step is to forgive yourself for being human and faulty. Self forgiveness is not permission to do.  But, understanding.
If you don't learn from your mistakes,  you are destined to repeat them until you do.

Personally,  I'd rather graduate to the next class.  Skinning your knee (metaphorically) is a small price to pay for the  knowledge and attendant skills learned.   Fire is hot,  it causes pain.  The pain  is a good thing stupid.  =P  It doesnt make fire a bad thing.

Cheers
 :)"

Too many friends  gone now for various reasons.  I'm constantly meeting new people  and potential friends, not like it's hard  for me to  talk to  people or anything, but,  my heart isn't in it anymore.
It seems just as easy to talk to people in other medium and actually make connections that are going to be more productive in areas that I'm interested in.

This time of the year, the spiders are all grown and hunting  furiously.   It is not the time to walk under trees.  Webs are everywhere.
I'm not a fan of spiders, but, I find them fascinating at a distance.
The mist in the air left tiny beads of water on the strands of the webs.  With the fog in the air and the light just right, it was a beautiful  show of glittering, sparkling lights.
The webs were everywhere.  I'm going to have to incorporate the imagery into a painting.
There was a  christmas tree pine that had webs  all over it, sized and spaced like purposeful decorations.
All very nice.

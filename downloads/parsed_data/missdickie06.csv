I went to class just like I do everyday but it seemed to drag on even more. Im pretty excited because I got all the classes that I wanted for next semester so thats a plus. I talked to my mom today...Jamie went to see her I thought that was kinda nice. I still dont know if they are coming down or not. I miss home so much:( I got a comment today from Jamies aunt Margie....I love her so much. She knows that ""bucket steak"" is one of my favorite foods so she told me she would make me some when I get home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I was told by someone that I love they didnt trust me. Hence the reason why I put the definition at the top. I give this person no reason not to trust me. Im not sure what their problem is. Bad day I hope. I have been thinking alot lately about the past...and usually I with ""I wouldnt change anything about my past"" but honestly I think I would. Maybe not change....but change some of the things I said. I probably would of said more in certain circumstances.&nbsp; I miss the easy simple days when mom and dad made more decisions about my life then I did. Its so hard to know whats right and what you should do at times.&nbsp;<br /><br />GREYS is on tonight:):):):) Finally somthing to look forward too. WVU plays tonight...GO eers:)<br /><br />anyway...goodnight and sweet dreams....&lt;3</span>"

"event","<p>...I woke up this morning feeling like I couldnt breathe. So that wasnt the best way to start the day off...ugh! I went to Yoga which always makes me feel so much better. If you have never taken a yoga class before you should...it is amazing! That is def. the only class that I lok forward to. After yoga I had lunch with Shana. She makes me laugh like no other! We are so smartass together it cracks me up. Then off to biology lecture. Good god I hate that class...but today a lady brought her kids with her..needless to say we were all entertained. I talked to my momma today about 100 times...I think she is coming down saturday...atleast I hope she does. I have to work this weekend for the last weekend until I go home. My dad called me today from work....kind of surprised me. Im sure my mom told him I was homesick so he figured he would call and check on me. It always nice talking to him. I love to make my dad laugh!! Jake went to the doctor today and found out that he had a rib ""out of place."" I thought it was kinda weird. Hopefully he gets alllll better:) hmmmmm....I took Shana to church..we stopped and got a sweet tea from mickey d's. They always make things so much better. Simple things in life right...<br />Jamie called me today....it was a change. He is amazing...honestly he makes me feel so much better about myself. Its unbelievable. I cant wait to see him....it kills me not seeing him all the time. Anyway...im off to watch the CMAs....<br /><br />goodnight...sweetdreams to all&lt;3</p>"

"event","&nbsp;.....Its my first entry and im so tired I cant hardly keep my eyes open. Some might think thats not a very good way to start off. In 8 days I get to finally go home to good ol Pocahontas County. This is the longest I have ever been away from home and im honestly wondering how I will ever move out let alone move away? School is going ok but soon it will be stressful again....not that its not right now. Finals are coming up and oh how I dont want to take them. I worked on my schedule for next semester today. It seems to be ok...no class before 10..EVER. The girls on the floor are honestly driving me nuts. I think im going to die if I dont get out of here. Everyone is fighting and honestly most are acting like we are in high school again. Ugh...Im so over all this freakin drama!!! Anyway...im tired and going to bed. Goodnight and sweet dreams to all...&lt;3


I was thinking of someone today...and this came to mind....

---&gt;Don't know what's going on
Don't know what went wrong
Feels like a hundred years I
Still can't believe you're gone
So I'll stay up all night
With these bloodshot eyes
While these walls surround me with the story of our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

Now things are coming clear
And I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared
So I'll stay out all night
Get drunk and fuck and fight
Until the morning comes I'll
Forget about our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

First time you screamed at me
I should have made you leave
I should have known it could be so much better
I hope you're missing me
I hope I've made you see
That I'm gone forever

And now it's coming clear
That I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever
And now you're gone forever
And now you're gone forever"

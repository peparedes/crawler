"event","WOW! Its been a while. So much has happened since the last time i wrote on here. First, Brit came back from Switzerland. She got me a really pretty bracelet-im goin to wear it all the time. Then, one night last week, me and her went over to this guy's house named Josh. See i met him at church about a month ago and i thought he was really HOTT! But i didn't know what to say to him so i just kinda said hey every week. Then i decided one night to ask him if he wanted to hang out with our group after church wed night, but he already had plans. I told him we could just do it next week and he got my number and said he'd call sometime. So anyways, me and Brit went over to his house a few nights later and he had 2 friends over. Brit and Calvin really hit it off and of course i still was interested in Josh. Josh left for GA for 4th of July and me, Brit, Calvin, and my sis, Lauren went to see War of the Worlds-which was really wierd and intense but good. Ill just say this, Calvin really liked Brit! So me and Josh have been texted for about a week while hes been in GA and I think we might start dating. We are goin to go see a movie when he gets back. So things are goin good. And ive been helpin the Holloway fam too by collecting money and sending it to her trust fund. I think ive done pretty good. Anyways, im ready for Josh and Brit-yeah she went out of town again-to get back so we can hang out again."

So anyways, we spent 4 hrs. cleaning Mrs. Hiedi and Mr. John's office and now were goin to get in the pool probably and then were goin over to Kyle's house for some more fun. We tried to teach Brit how to play ""MOW"" but she got really mad. She sucks basically! O.k., im gonna go now, buh-bye."

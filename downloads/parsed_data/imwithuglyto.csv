"event","omg...i'm soo fuckin sick of my parents...it's like i can't do anything right..let's see..let me list all of the things that make me my parents ""devil"" child
1) i smoke....OH NO!!! wat a sin(im being sarcastic)
2)i have no dreams...no future...and im going nowhere...which my mom had no problem pointing out to me tonite..it kinda sux wen the people that are supposed to support and be there for you through everything tell you that u'r a screw up and u'r gunna be a bum...but thats cool..i dont need ne one ne ways..cept for you nina!
3) apparently i'm on drugs...for 2 apparent reasons
-first because apparently i always run upstairs and put my pj's on wen i get home...cuz u kno that means im doing drugs...hello...first of all i run upstairs right away most likely cuz i ahve to pee...or becuase i smell like smoke and i dont wanna get in shit for smelling like smoke andi dont feel like getting bitched at...but u kno this is much better
-second of all...my special friends...yes you baykin...leave papes in my car...ok...i tried to say it was for fixing smokes with...but she didnt buy it...which sux becuase how many times hav u guys seen me get high?..like you kno...5 times...shit
4) i go out to much and im never ""concentrating on my studies""..ok..so i failed history..that would be the first class i have failed..in like..i dunno...FOREVER!..and i'm making it up...its not like i wont get into college now becuase of it...like fuck...
all i have to say is...im sry i'm not the perfect child...but maybe one day they'll see through my faults and finally notice me for the good in me."

"event","what is there in life to live for
is there anyone listening to your cry
you can feel the hurt deep inside your core
you can't fit in no matter how hard you try
no matter what you say
no matter what you do

what can you do 
when the world turns its back on you
and you have no one left to turn to
it's like you talk so loud but no one wants to hear
and they take it all away, they take it all away
just die, inside, for love, for friends,just die

when your home alone and left behind
sitting there just waste away
you just lay there, let time pass you by
they're so cruel and make you pay
for all things that you can't change
no matter what you do
 
what can you do
when the world turns its back on you
and you have no one left to turn to
its like you talk so loud but no one wants to hear
and they take it all away, they take it all away
just die, inside,for love, for friends, just die"

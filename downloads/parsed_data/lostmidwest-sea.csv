"event","you know you've hit thirty when you're too paranoid to google your deepest desires on the internet, so you sit in a chair and google your name instead.  you know you're thirty when you realize everything you wanted to do at twenty, you never got around to.  you know your thirty when your music collection is older then your kid.  man, i gotta get out of this pit.  clawing my way out or deeper?  i can't figure which way is up.  out?  sobriety sucks!  there's always something in the way, there's always another bill to pay, there's always someone else to think about, there is always time against me.  moving along like a current that looked gentle enough on the surface, gravity pulling ever harder, inevitable.  putting a stick in won't tell you how hard, only for awhile.  i need a plan, like i need.... well, another plan.  atlanta just another dallas, (no offense dad) but really, i'd rather move to bow-hunk bull shit town then another city.  i could go find one of these modern ghost towns, created when farming turned corporate, vote myself into office, be the mayor and legalize sanity!  wait!  even better...re organize the monarch and become queen!  create a commune and out law stupidity!  death by sensibility!  patience my ass.  
patience gets me nowhere, now here. c--"

"event","so much for attempting to be in a good mood.  the glint in his eye wasn't for me.  i guess, sadly enough it's at that point.  but my best friend?  well, at least she was honest to me and at least she didn't allow herself to be placed in that position of no turning back.  at least that is something, i still have a friend.  well, fuck.  i don't think i will come back from europe.  maybe they will let me stay.  i can prove i'm english and i do speak the lanuage.  they have cars in england, right?  no more bush, no more self loathing, no more white liberal guilt, no more family.  well, i will miss my dad and brother.  they understand me.  i don't.  fuck realtionships.  they are too damn hard and complicated, fuck being grown and mature, so what, i'll be that old lady sitting at the end of the bar by myself.  i'll go home to my cats and occasionally bring someone with me.  fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfcukfcukfuckfuckfucthere is something twistedly meditative about hitting those four keys, very rymthic.  SAVE ME, JEBUS!  i'm so sick of this, what?  do guys just want an unopinionated, never to bitch, bow at your feet and service you woman?  you can't have a fucking thought in your fucking head?  you can't have an opinion?  when he asks you if you think he's fat and bitches about it, you can't tell him when you see him with the package of cookies that's why he so fucking fat?  when he's supposed to stay at home to be the ""stay at home dad"" and he doesn't do the job requirements, you have no fuucking say so in the matter? hey, when i stayed at home, the bills were paid, the house was spotless, and the baby was well taken care of.  dinner wasn't on the table when he got home because he didn't get hungrey until after he got stoned and then didn't like what i cooked because it's not out of a goddamn box or frozen pizza.  hey, sorry bud, my mom didn't feed me shit, she may be a lot of things and a good southern cook was one.  that's why your fat and i'm a size two, because I DON""T EAT SHIT!!!!!!! so i'm supposed to go to a crappy job for 9 hours and not be upset when i come home and the house is a wreak?
i'm supposed to come home and clean it?  because i don't know about ya'll but i can't live in fucking filth.  i've tried not riding him about it and it only encouraged to mess.  "" duh, she didn't say anything, maybe she didn't notice, maybe she don't care, duh"" AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   time for me to crawl in my shell and die."

"event","ok, i'm tired of only writing bad stuff down.  i'm not always upset, i am happy occasionally.  i'm happy i don't have to work tomorrow.  i'm happy because Shuey's got that glint in his eye which means he's feeling a little randy, and when he approches me, usually that means it'll be good for me.  i love good sex. {sigh} i got everything done today i was suppoosed to in reference to howard coming through omaha.  that's a nice feeling, when you tell someone you'll do something and ...get this... you do it. now i'm gonna go watch tv and eat junk food.  maybe Kasha'll come over tonight..."

"event","all that time and effort for nill.... painting, good painting, waiting, phone tag, failed e-mail, finally!! got it to 'em and she ""don't like the purple, too much purple""  who doesn't like purple?  this bitch is one snotty fuck for wasting everyone's time.  there goes $300 we coulda used.  there wasn't even that much purple in it, only a small sphere (ok a large sphere) in the center.  when she was asked what she likes and don't..her reply... ""i don't want to stiffle your creativity""  moron!!  it's still a good painting tho, and i bet he can sell it to someone else.  actually, it's an amazing painting.  maybe i can sell it at the farmer's market.  hey, cornhuskers have culture...stop laughing...."

"event","well, it's a good thing we're at war.  war generates, even if it's temporary, money.  lots and lots of money.  we're gonna need that money to pay for all the babies women keep having by men who've already had several by several women.  make sense, yeah, me neither.  war also generates, death.  imagine that!  so thank you, g.w.bush for killed off future contenders of the gene pool and social security.  alltho, i think the next of kin gets the benefits, but still!!  one less asshole to drink my water and fuck up my air.  stupid women, always having babies, unwanted babies, babies that take money out of my taxes so the public schools are so decrepit i have to pay tuition for my daughter to get a education.  stupid politicians, always taking the moral high road!  fucking pay for the god damn abortion or better yet, the birth control.  if i have to pay for the pregnancy, the birth, the wic, the food stamps, the medicaid, the state to place it in foster care, the state to prosecute, the state to incarcerate, i'll pay for the pill, the abortion, the sterilization.  stupid people.  i hate stupid, closed-minded people.  i hate women who can't fucking ""stop rutting long enough for us to figure out this food, air deal"" i don't blame men, men are stupid, men are horny, women are just as horny, but we all know masturbation usually works out better.  there should be a test you have to take before having kids, kinda like the one you have to take before you graduate.  if you answer ""yes"" to any one, you can't have kids.
1)  are you on crack/meth/heroin?
2)  do you already have 2 kids (even if you're catholic, god didn't say multiply to the point of ridiculous)?
3)  are you an idiot?
4)  is your partner?
you, know, shit like that...
thank you bill hicks, i miss you!"

"event","Another weekend is over and stuff is changing - time is moving too fast and im scared.  So much stuff is going on in my head but of course i cant post it or else i will have a trillion (exageration) people either asking me whats wrong, being pissed at me, or just thinking that im going pyscho and i dont feel like dealign wiht that right now.  Its weird people say that senior year you realize all things about your friends, family, and most impportantly yourself. This is sooo true.  In the past month or so i have learned so much about myself. Ive been doing alot of thinking, cuz of course i cant pay attention in class so i have some tiem to think, And from this moment on i am going to make an active effort to change some aspects of my life. This sounds messed but someone told me that they made a list of the characteristics theyt liked abotu themself and the ones they didnt like. this way they could keep the possitives and change the negs. Maybe seeing it in writting and having a goal will help me get motivated.  Needless to say, it should be interesting to see how this will all work out.  
Im going to leave you with this thought that you will hopefully apply to your daily life. TREAT OTHERS AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED!!!!!! im so sick of this shit..."

I think im just really stressed right now and overwhelmed basically by life.  i need some thinking time. on that note I visited purdue and indiana this weekend.  Imleaning towards purdue but i still need to ehar from U of I and visit Iwoa. indiana was too spread out for me even though they had the most gorgeous guys. so as this moment im goign to purdue (assuming i dont fall in love wiht iowa and dont get accept to U of I.) it could be totally awesome though. me and laura(who also is going topurdue) are gonna room together we are both 96.9% we are going! (haha right laura?!!?) it would be a blast.  today in pysch we got yelled at like 2394783475 times becayse we were talking abotu it.  we are officialy freaks we already made diagrams of where all our furniture will go and stuff and who will bring what!  thinking about that made me happy! this just reinstates my bipolar theory.

"event","Wow, its been a few weeks since my last entry. Nothing too major has happened. I went to barcelona, Spain. Which was amazing until i got either food poisoning or the flu.  My parents had firts class and my brother and i had coach so on the way back my mom felt sorry for me and switched seats. so that was definatly a plus. It was cool; the chairs turned into a bed! anyways, now back to reality. A part of me wished i didnt miss this much school.  Im like failing all my classes. OKay so im nto really failing but it seems that way to me. ill admit it im an over achiever and the grades im getting are jsut not the grades im happy wiht and its really upsetting me. i guess it will be okay its still is only first quarter so all i have to do is work my ass off the next couple of weeks to raise them back up. OY! its stressin me out just thinking about it.  The joke is i always told myself that senior i wouldnt care about grades cuz ill all ready be accepted into college, but somehow i still want to succede. oh well. On the college subject, i have heard from 5 of the 7 schoosl i applied to. and ive gotten into all of them. (Purdue, univ. of indiana, univ. of iowan, ISU, and Drake) but 1/2 of those were my safetys and i still need to hear from University of Illinois and Wisconisn. So who knows. and no i havent visited any of them yet. this too is causing major issues. My parents, for some wacked out reason, wouldnt let me visit schools unitl i got accepted, but now im accepted they want me to visit during the week to ""get a true sense of the campous"". THIS IS BULLSHIT! i cant miss anymore school. i will fail out for real if i do. all i know is when my kids are going through this whole process, im going about it way differently.  OKay well i gotta go plan all these college visits."

""Welcome To My Life"" 


Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you

Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like to be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
When no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like

Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over

Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
But deep inside you're bleeding

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like to be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
When no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like

Welcome to my life

No one ever lies straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy 
But I'm not gonna be ok

Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work it was always there
You don't know what it's like
What it's like

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
When no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
When no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like

Welcome to my life

Welcome to my life

Welcome to my life"

"event","So i officially have senoritis (no clue how to even spell that) i just cant wait to get out of here and have a chance to start over. at the same time it is really sad realizing that on friday I had my last loyality day assembely and odds are i am NEVER gonna see half of these people ever again. oh well, thats life.  On a happier note, there is a very good possibility that school will be cancelled tomo for Northbrook. I guess something wiht the water broke and they had to shut it off but after they turn it back on you have to boil water for 2 days. so my quesiton is how is the cafeteria gonna make lunch? isnt it a law that the schools have to seve lunch? i doubt they will boil their water before they use it? Hmmm...i guess we'll find out tomorrow. Last night sucked i felt sorta shitty all day but NEEDDED TO GO OUT, well come like 630ish as im starting to ger ready i start to feel really weird, sorta like im gonna pass out. anywways as it turns out my momma thinks i was dehydrated so i rested a bunch last night and feel all better. i guess it wasnt soo bad i got a chance to do some thinking and figured out who was incredibally fake, and who is a genunine friend....I thank those of you who cared abotu me and told me they hoped i felt better, that worked made me feel a lot better : )
otay, well its time to finish this homework. Yuck. Leave some love, it makes me happy (but then again i doubt you really really care about that)!"

Today went really well. It was late arrival so i got to sleep and i didnt really have any classes today.  Im soo excited, im in child dev. seminar and i get to leave school in the middle of the day to  be a teachers asistent at meadowbrook. I havent been there in like 6 years. it should be really fun.  Tomorrow is a B day, yuck, all my academics. But my physics teacher is blind and she is training a seeing eye dog. so we have a golden lab puppy in the class. ABSOLUTLEY ADORABLE! its the only thing keeping me from dropping that class. More to come later, peace for now"

"event","Wow, i cant even remember the last time i updated. I guess i have been sorta preocupied.  First my parents are INSANE about all this college shit...they wont even let me out of the house until its all done, thats not normal!!  The good news is that im basically done with all the applications and personal statement stuff - whew, what a relief. 
       On a totally other subject, stuff right now is really messed up and im not exactly sure when or how everything got this way.  All i know is i can not wait for it to go back to normal...i hope it does : / 
      I know i havent been the best friend recently i have just been going through a really weird time, i cant even describ it and i appologize for that.  I think everything is okay between me and everyone, but im not 100% sure.  I miss the way the fab 7 was.  I feel like my life is serioiusly falling apart right now and it sucks! Megan had an away message that freaked me out a bit because it puts into words all my feelings...

""do you ever just get that feeling where you dont want to talk to anybody? you dont wanna smile and you dont wanna fake being happy, but at the same time you dont know exactly what is wrong either. there isnt a way to explain it to someone who doesnt already understand. if you could want anything in the world it would be to be alone. people have stopped being comforting and being alone never was. at least when youre alone no one will constantly ask you whats wrong and there isnt anyone who wont take 'i dont know' for an answer. you feel the way you do just because. you hope the feeling will pass soon so youll be able to be yourself again. but until then, all you can do is wait...""

After reading that it got me to relieze a few things.  I guess I needed some time to just think i dont really know, but im ready to TURN MY LIFE AROUND! no more of this self pitty crap. I took for granted how absolutlely amazing my friends are and Im sorry 1853975 times!  you guys are all terrific, and i know i havent shown it recently but i really appriciate it.  THis is our last year together, I want to make it unforgetable before we all go our seperate ways.  So hopefully we can all put behind us the things that were said...or left unsaid and just look forward to a fabulous senior year. My BFFs (and you each know who you are) you mean so much to me and Im gonna try my hardest to make things alright again..."

Then i had to work at the day care. YUCK! even though i only work once a week, it is way too much.  
Nothing really eventful happened today, but it was still a good day. 
Tomorrow is NB park district swim night...should be interesting. Hopefully it will get rained out cuz i just dont really want to go.  haev i mentioned how sick I am of camp? CUZ I AM! i dont liek children anymore or half of the staff...okay so i lied there are only liek 2 counselors that dont annoy me and one of them is the director. its just not a good situation.

Does anyone know how to make one of those cool lj? Mine is way to boring i want a pretty one!"

Todays is my mommas birtday so im not allowed to go out.  The one night I actually feel like getting all ready and stuff im not allowed to - just great.  Thats okay i guess there is always tomorrow. Speaking of tomorrow, it starts the last week of camp for the year! YES! im sooo sick of it. I cant deal with small children anymore.   Then one week from tonday its cruise time! Hell yaz! im soo excited for that. I need to get tan. this summer has diffinatly had a lack of sun. YUCK. 
On a totally different subject, Im quitting my job at the day care. HURRAY! once again for the same reasons, IM SICK OF WATCHING KIDS! Any suggestions of how to quite? I need to find a new job though. I applied to work at the front desk of the Glenview Park District. Its where Haley works and would be so great to work with her, but they havent called me yet.

"event","I hate to use the cliche quote but i think i might have opened a bag of worms.  Everyone always tells me to share how Im feeling or whatever.  I know that each of my friends has told me when Im pissed about something that i shouldnt keep it all inside - like i usually do...so i took their advise and shared everything on my mind.  Maybe i shouldnt have i dont really know. I want all my friends to know that you mean the world to me and im not trying to upset any of you, i just needed to get this off my back. i completely agree that ""they probably dont realize that it affects you in the way that it has"" but it does.  you guys are  really great best friends, but recently i have just felt like crap and this seemed llike the best way to tell everyone whats been on my mind recently. its a whole lot easier to type what im thinking than to talk in person or whatever.  so hopefully i got whatever i needed to out in the open and things will start to look up. I HONESTLY LOVE ALL OF YOU VERY MUCH but those little things sometimes add up and then one tiny event pushes you over the edge and thats what basically happened. Megan had a really good quote today on her away message ""everytime you go through a tough time you feel like dying but you need to accept the fact that its how life goes. life is about pain, happiness, sadness, love and excitement.""  I guess i need to remeber that quote and remind myself that without the hard times you would never be able to appriciate all the great times.

"event","I know I had a live journal a few months ago, but i decided to delete it...well its back.  I need a way to vent - and this is a perfect way.  I really dont even know who I can turn to anymore to just talk, so this is bascially my only option.  I cant go crying to my mom, she will think im going pysco. and for my friends, well i sometimes dont think they realize i even exsist.   I know that sounds really harsh; but thats exactly the way i feel right about now. and im sick of it.  When I do actually go out I come home and end up crying. So its gotten to the point where its easier to just not go out.  I cant take it anymore and i honestly dont know what to do. you know how in groups of friends there is always that one person who noone really likes, she is the one who always strays behind them when walking,nobody realluy wants to sit in the front when she drives  and noone really notices or cares  about her- Well thats me. For once i  want to be that girl who is in the center of the group, not following in the shadow.  This is gonna sound really stupid but it reall bothers me why is that when we are hanging out my  arm is never grabed to come along when we are going somewhere.  For those of you who have no clue what im even talking about (and odds are that is most of you seeing that Im just rambling on and on) My friends do this thing were they grab each others arms when they go places, really cute, right? Except my arm is never the one grabbed. i know this sounds really petty but it hurts. What, are you ashamed of me? am i not good enough or pretty enough for you to be associated with me? I sometimes wonder why they are even friends with me? I truthfully question if they actually like me? Whenever I am with them I feel like im the reject of the group. You know, the one noone really likes but everyone just sorta feels sorry for them.  I dont know if its my own insecurities or what but sometimes i think the entire world hates me and my  ""best friends"" dont make that feeling any better.  I know that all of my friends are going to be really hurt by this update but im sorry I cant keep it inside anymore. Everything in my life is falling apart right now, and when I needed my friends the most it seems like they could care less. Im fed up with everyone being so damn self centered! reality check - there are othger people in this world than yourself!  Im not writting this to get pitty from anyone or put anyone on a guilt trip and im really sorry if that comes off this way. My purpose in writting this is to prevent my head from exploding from all these emotions.   I feel that im a fairly nice person and that gets taken advantage of way too many times. wow, that felt good now that im done being a bitch i want you to know this is not going out to all my friends. i ahve 2 or 3 girls that are truely good people and have been there for me and I thank you 184975 times for that. I dont even know anymore, maybe im beeing oversensative...or maybe not sensative enough...all I know is i feel like crap and my getting all my feelings out in the open like this has helped a whole lot."

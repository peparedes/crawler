(i kno that doesn't make sense to any1 but i don't&nbsp; want to explain). he's at emt class now... n i miss him like mad. i didn't feel good today n i stayed home from school n jodi's visiting now so i'm gonna chill w/ her n maybe eat some food cuz i'm hungry again.</FONT></P>

WELL I'M NOT. i'm so hearboken it's not even funny. turns out he's goin out with some 8th grader named amber. i guess i'm just not good enough and nothing i ever do will be good enough. he led me on and being the dumbass i am i fell for him....hard. i feel worthless and i've been depressed ever since. it just kills me that i don't have a chance with him and i probably never did. he said it could be over like that w/ her but i seriously doubt it... and even if he did break up with her why would he want me? i usually don't get upset over guys.. but it's something about him. like i can't eat, or sleep, or even concentrate because it all just keeps playing back in my mind. i keep thinking about how he said he wanted to get together and how he wished i didn't have a boyfriend and how&nbsp;he wanted me to tell him as soon as i was single so that we could hook up. well his wish came true and i guess it's one of those be careful what you wish for things.... becuase&nbsp;now he's happy and i'm the miserable one who has to sit by and watch him be with some other girl. i could have made him happy, and i would have loved to, but i guess that's what slutty 8th graders are for. that was supposed to be my kool-aid and she took it.&nbsp;i've never ever cried over a guy before and every tear i've shed in the past two days has been becaue of him. he broke my heart and he's seriously the first one to do that.&nbsp;i think it's my fault though, because maybe, just maybe if i had broken up with my boyfriend sooner i wouldn't have missed my chance.... that is if i even had one to begin with.&nbsp;alright enough with the whole self pitty shit.... my life sucks right now and that's all there is to it.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc0000>okay, today is my sister's birthday and she's having a roller sating party. so yesterday my nana pat took me to get rollerblades. i got home and decided i was gonna go try em out. so i skated up this alley by my house and then decided i could take the hill right above it. (if you know anything about where i live it's a steep mother fuckin hill) so i got up to the top and then realized i had to get back down..... i was like ok... i can take it. about half was down i was goin about 25/30 mph no lie. and i was like shit.. what if a car comes? so i got his bright idea to do one of those stops like hockey players do and turn and use the sides of my blades to stop. IT DIDN'T WORK! i ended up slidng down the rest of the hill on my knee and elbow and other hand. i though it was pretty funny so i started laughing. there was blood running down my leg and arm... so i went home... went into the bathroom washed the cuts off... dug out the rocks and then bandaged it all up. so then i went back down stairs still laughing and told everyone what happened. well i guess cuz i was laughing they didn't believe me. then it started to hurt so i got ice and went to lay upstairs with ice on everything. my grandma comes up and is like don't you think this is a little over kill. so i go ""what the fuck woman it burns..."" so i showed her my 'injuries' and she like almost passed out cuz they were still gushing blood. so then christina called to see if i waned to go swimming. i told her i just fucked up my leg and arm and she said the water would clean it out. i asked her if it would hurt and she said no.. so i went up there. well the chlorene hurt like a son of whore... it burned so bad... so i was like i don't wanna swim anymore. then nick and carm came up and harry kept callin cuz he was bored. it was pretty funny because we just kept passing the phone around and then christina hung up on him. so yeah... now i can definately say i rip shit up and mean it. they're pretty wicked..... so if you see me ask to see them... i'm actually really proud. </FONT></P>

But anywho... christina's all upset cuz her mom is bein gay, and i was trying to talk to her this morning but she dosn't really want to listen, let alone believe me so that kinda upset me. i mean she's one of my best friends but she doesn't believe half of the things i say. i dunno.. another thing that has me slightly upset is that my boyfriend is goin and talking about me at PA. for the record nothing happened, but he's goin around saying how ""he's the man"" and ""you should see what she does for me"" and ""we're home alone all of the time and the stuff&nbsp;she does is mind blowing"". if somethin had gone down i wouldn't care as much... but he's just flat out lying... it's like he's bragging when nothing even happened. i guess it's just hat i didn't think he was like that. </FONT></P>

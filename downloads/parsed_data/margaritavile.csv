"event","im babysitting today because its spring break so im watching my sisters kids and have nothing to do so i decided to check up on an old friend someone who useto mean the world to me but because of things that happend and hurt feelings we lost that.  so i read her journal to see how thing we i do that every once and a while just to make sure shes ok.  and found out shes been having a tough time lately.  i was borred so i read her whole journal and started thinking about when we were inseperable because we became really close around this time last year.  right now my life is great i have cut alot of people out of my life or they cut me for what ever reason but the ones that are left i love.  but sometimes i miss brooke because she was someone i could alwas talk to but times change and what doesnt kill us only makes us stronger"

"event","ok so last night i got pissed off at my sister i love her but lately she is being a complete bitch she wants to know when i'm going to move out (as soon as i have the money and a place) so i left my house for my second home denny's its kind of like my cheers everyone knows my name.  So i went to talk to rachel and told her about what i read in shanes journal because it was about her and is was good.  Then brook called and wanted me to go with her to wash her car so i told her to meet me at my house. So we left brett and jeremiah at my house to wait for cal. we went and washed her car and went to jack in the crack for some food then to find a funnel for the beer bong. When we got home i was told that rachel called and want to meet me for coffee when she got off at so we did. then back to my house again with rachel jeremiah and cal. We sat outside and jeremiah and cal were making us laugh.  Then rachel left and cal and i were talking about ginger his little girlyfriend and he told me that he was thinking about breaking up with her bacause she is young and that made me happy because i dont really like her and ever since she has been around he has been distancing himself from the crew.  and rachel thinks that cal and i should hook up but i love him so much he is one of my best friends and i dont want to lose him so oh well."

"event","ok so my friend sam says that i need to share my poems with people and this is the safest way i can think of to do it.  so let me know what you think even if you think it sucks
This game we play called love is killing me.  You and I play as if we know what is going on, but do either of us have a clue.  Playing this gave of oneupmanship trying to out do the other.  Trying to prove we don't need each other but if that were true then why do we keep coming back why can't we just walk away and never look back.  We have tried that before and it got us nowhere.  Our lives without each other were not as good as our lives together.  But still we hurt each other when we are together and we hurt ourselves when we are apart.  So we need to decide which is better to hurt alone or to hurt together, that is the question we are now facing"

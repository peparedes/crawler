"event","i was tghinking about what i acomplished. at work they were telling me how good i was doing, and i got a 50 cent raise. woopidy doo. then i dont know i was just thinking of what i acompluished so far. like last year i really wanted change so bad. i wanted to change my life, change me. 
  for the longest time i wanted to validate that i have become a good , well a more society accepted person. like i wanted to kill of the parts of me that leaned into wreckless ness and wanted so bad to prove to myslef that it wasnt there. like that the beast wasnt in a cage within me hiding but still a factor that could at times take control. but things happened. i realized i am what i am. im not exactly gonna do the mike tyson philosophy, but i am gonna believe this, if i wasnt meant to be like this then god wouldnt have made me so care free. based on the situations ive been in and all the cahnces for really messing stuff up ive done pretty good. i feel bad though becsaue i lie still. i wasnt always a gentle man to ladees who now im sure werent always acting as a ladee would to me. if some see me as a hoar or as some boy toy then there wrong, ive got a soul and virtue and i am just confused . really like i can accept taht i dont understand love and how it works.it takes two people to flirt and two people for other things, i think i have to protect myslef and quit trying to be a hero, i think thats were i was getting at. im not a hero and i usually blame myself when things dont go right. im not gonna find love by rescueing some random person, and if i do that still shouldnt be a goal. i enjoy drugs. i enjoy the feel of breaking in another persons face, i also enjoy playing with preschoolers and singing in choir. i like not careing when it comes to my well being, i still take care off myself, im fitter than most people i know but i dont worry. im not a slacker with no ambition i just dont worry. 

i will expect my beasts, i will jsut choose to not put myself into the situations, a deep day i was thinking about this a zoo animal a tiger  i think escaped becsaue it was angered and given the chance, and the beast killed the ones teasing it, i will not let the beast inside me get the oppertunity to escape, nor will i tease it. 

another thing i needa change is i am passionate speaker, but i usually dont care about what anyone is saying, to the point that i wont argue cuz i just dont ever care much, if i was giving advice or soemthing id argue and debate like plato but man i just dont care most the time. i think i really need to start to care when someone talks to me even if they talk about things i dont care for, becsaue i do have an opinion and i have to treat them like gold. and people who dont wnat my opinion can just bite dust. people that just watch me talk but dont listen suck, and i will be man enough to call them on that and cut off our relations, no matter how pretty or fun the person is. i wont be a male manican. ever"

"event","sunshine

in a creek by my childhood memory banks,
waves back and forth revealing and then hiding a golden
shimmer along the ripples that contour
and curve along what i remember.

rays of light shooting solid beams through leaves
of trees and hearts, 
so bright showing patterns of dark shadows
on the flowers and long pillowing grass
that hold and nurture me

my naked being warm and secure 
protected by the sunshine flowing freely.
the smell of sweet wheat greats me
and i smile sending light back from my face

through the trees and leaves
from my heart back into the deep blue 
gift giver that gave me the sunshine
saying thank you."

"event","Fury

i cringed my teeth
things ive heard from miles away

the reddened vision of a madman
pinning the arms of another man to his body

a gesture may be seen as sweet
but i know better

because as i held his arms down i bit his shoulder
his arms couldn't fight me
i held him tight like a leather band around a bale of hay rolling in a windstorm
and i feel his knees try.

try to break the rest of what is left of him free
from all the pain

i see it. pain. from the back of my eyes i want to rip someone. just grab them and hold them down and quickly take pieces off 
things ive heard

things ive heard hurt me.
things i have heard
with my eyes would be things i have seen but
as i read those words i knew that miles away the ideal was false
the running portrait of a damsel in distress a ploy and rous
to keep my running
and though i read it, as i seen i heard a voice say it
my voice, and that voice was flitering through cringed teeth. 
my teeth

the feeling is back
 the FURY.
i want to start biting pieces of people till the space between my teeth widen and
my gums go soar
my ears throb in heat as if the sun it self
spoke into them
my mouth keeps moving
my eyes keep reading
and though the writer is far away i know it may be right
my ears keep hearing
and as i hear 
it is the voice filtered through teeth

i want to see them fall.
Everyone ive met along the way.
This wicked crusade. 
hope for love was never a grail. was never a champion
hope for love was never out of reach.
but as i grabbed it
it grabbed me
a glowing cup that made me thirsty on sight
but as i drank its lies
poisoned me
its so hard to breathe
i am not gonna let such a malicous charade kill me 
nothing will kill me for i 
will watch them all fall.

the hyeena waits and is wreckless but the volture never tastes its meat
the scratch only stings but can leave a pulsing heart infected.
i beat walls and men alike i do not care for what is living or dead
life is off no consequence if your not going to die
the blows to my heart left my seeing no meaning in death
for as my lungs studder open and closed so too
shall i hold my lives time law
for it is my broken hands that clench it!

all this said through my teeth

so hard to breathe as only words of anger and poison take over.
when i get there, too were i was hence coming
i will cut her down
i will cut down her holder for he is as vile as the swine queen he worshipped.
with his hands i will plow the earth and plant new seeds
with those seeds many lives will grow
but i will kill all but the greatest sapling
for it is the only thing i can use to escape the elaborate towers that hold her

my breathes grew strong
i was done planning
no need for reading
no need for talking no need to hear

just this
a narrowing of my eyes as i focus
a crackling sounds of cracking teeth as i bite bown to resist the urge
to forget all that was told.
all that made me see.
all that was"

"event","i think? i never really wrote a happy one because those memories are usually not vivid. so experiments.

Carried Away

The roar of a tiger funneled through the hills
of grass, smell of grass, people of grass
lets have a pick nick of words

i never got why people went to parks besides using the slides or swings
didn't see the concept of a park of field and benches
i saw a boisterous man playing ball
he was overweight and old
and flew lighter than the angel by him in a bright red dress. white lace and all

on a blanket eyes to the skies.
the sharp blades of grass folds under our protector our comforter
strings that intertiwne only half heartedly
like the pattern on a coach i had not too long ago

We gilde up and down the hills
running in circles
running in flowers
running in beauty
running in my minds memory as i start to
think back
to how things are getting so much better

everyday i hesitate to wake up only for a moment
those moments have been getting short and shorter
as the time from the turns
gets long and longer
time works weird three years is a lifetime to a three year old
four years is a life sentence for a poorboy in highschool
five years is too short for a man on a journey towards the better

I jump up and the tree moves down
the bark sweeps under me
as it picks my young body up with its old wood
i feel its strength in movement
like the flexing grace of a spider web sailing in the wind

i look down how did i get here
Ill just jump.
NO.
Ill just walk across.
GET DOWN.
PAnicked voices make me feel good, feel loved.

DAve STOP. MY GOD YOUR GETTING CARRIED AWAy!
a man in small red running shorts yells from a distance.
he's taller than he looks because his feet are the waves that come from me
actually hes so small now
DAVE COME BACK
I hear his nervous anger and the authority in his anxiety
i am not hurt, the memory of being worried for
as the waves carried me, i am content
a tiger holding my neck

I sit and watch from the ground.
A blouse is now the trees sail
brown and tan a piece of the art
It covers her and pulls her into wood and dirt
i think off how the tree grew a head
arms legs and a soft face from its
hard flaking crust of bark and underlaying moss

Jump 
higher
bad knee 
good knee
HAnds reach with an arms pull
I GO IT!
im down and bleeding
one is up and scared
of continuing on to the others.
A happy portrait in between.

And as i wait i laid there
Bleeding from the hand
bandaged by natures grass
carried by natures promise

so i might go back and fix this. i wrote this in two sittings, i forgot about it but this was my saved template, i really wanted to write a diffrent poem about something i talking to kayla about, the last peice of the tragic three, i think im wralmed up now..."

ANd then i drive to work and space out and just look at the road and meditate. thats my day. oh and i eat this great breakfast of better n eggs mixed with refried beans, and a tortilla.  i miss the neverending story. one day when i have to grow up ill make myself an auryn so that i can wear it in remebrance of my golden days."

"event","my life really got slow. especially compared too when i was a profesional produce farmer. no more trips to places or crazy gatherings of people io dont really know. but man. i still go through random adventures. july 4th was one. holy mole. if it was a war movie my older sister would have beejn a casualty. a person lost in the masses . so my sister couldnt ride with me becasue she wanted to leave early that day cuz she leaves for work at5. and to me that was ok becaue i asumed she brought a cell. and what the heck she didnt . 
        anywho at the marina of the village prominated with suisun ites i went. i thought wow fireworks were so much fun two years ago, and last year i kicked my slef in the pantsi pretty sure i remebered  but man. so i go out and see aso many non parking places, my sister folowing hecka slow and dumb driving. and then i lose her at a turn. and dont see her again taht night. i park somere illegal and by then i get a call from a friend telling me that they wouldnt even come to the marina which was super smart. cuz the marina was s o crwoded. and i was hot. iwas walking around looking for a short asain looking person (my sis) among a crowd of tall white people or short black haired asian people that all looked the same. and i see a friend in front of the comic                                                         store                            and it was so hot and i was thirsty sohe was drinking and he offered and i drnak some. alot. and crack  its alchohal soi make a face shrugg it off and start walking around. looking for my sister but slowed down by a bunch of random people spoting me here and there. asking me how  ive been, why i didnt button my shirt up at all that kind of thing. then i leave to meet my friends the Mallaris and i walked around in front of a gas station looking for them for like a good 5 min. but some mom yelled at her son stop moving the fire works started. so i ducked down and sat on my fury blanket. by the time i realized she was yelling at her son who was touching peoples cars behind me i was like already stunned by the fire works. they were short but i didnt realize how much everyone around me liked them too until that day. like its universal. after that i walked away and actually saw the mallarris . haha and there crying cousin. then after that i drove around suisun then too my friends house which was by the park near the rail road tracks near east tabor. randy was playing wow and we talked about how crazt time flies. his mom cooked good sinagong. we ate it. i needed to shit so i went home. besides gassy i had a strange moment in the car, a moment of feeling, like i felt like i acomplished alot.                    
           not productive in a sense but productive in a memory. like i made memories that day thatwill stick. walking around letting the wind nearly blow my shirt off. forgetting i had a necklace in my pocket and almost paying the icecream man with  one. getting a cellphone call from my sister using a random persons phone she met. like she was like, my phones dead, and i wondered then whos phone is this. i may not go on grand adventures or experince mental trips of deep sight, but i still really love whats goin on around me."

I guess hmm. i guess not many people do becasue ive been misread by people i would call chums. and its not like there are people that i talk to alot and so on.this isnt a sad note or a rant. im just figuring things.i just feel like my art is not going anywere and the deciison making is like really ticking in means of time. some sort of sign or something should tell me that this will be ok that i will be ok in what im persueing. i just met an artist who is 43. he is old and alone and poor. his paintings are not my taste, and he had a way of looking at people with some sort of pride. anywho seeing someone like that got me thinking. is that what id really be great at, i wanted to write a book about vanity and how it surrounds us in a negative unseen way , and send it too kurt vonneget who died about a week ago.  he was probably the only author i'd want to read my stuff. anywho that project is down the tube becsaue the only interview that went right was online with only one person who was oddly enough not offeneded like the other people( women) i talked too. 
     i don't know i guess i jsut want to do something that goes in the line of putting my slef in some sort of self finding path of somethging new. like  a trip or somesort ofgood book or anything. i feel dumb, like a kid looking for adventure inside the fenced barriers of his backyard. what am i doing wrong. isnt fun and life learning lessons soposed to come if your fun, and like to criticlly think about life and learn. im a 20 year old american almost man kind of deal and im getting fat.i take chances but that chance to take a chance in my life is so low. at a time i used to run from boredom, and now i jsut watch it suround me and forget its there."

"event","i was just thinking. what did i acomplish this vacation. what did i do. most vacations i go on some trip or do something that induces a trip and i feel i made memories. something new i cant do over a 2 day break taht is the norm. something that i wouldnt trade. i havent had a vacation like that since i left Hawaii. i just overall felt empty about not going anywere or seeing anything. but this vacation was diffrent. dont get me wrong i wasnt as well traveled as i usually am but this was better. i got to discover deeper friendships and greater meanings within people that i feel i've gotten to know. well for starters i got to really see what the diffrence between strangers and great people to share life with is. experience. just experience. anyone could be a great person to share life with. man. 
  when i took a friend to the meuseum i wanted to laugh becasue his input was deep and also humerous becasue hes a naturally humerous guy. 
  i got to really get to spend time with a really special group of sisters that i really nver hung around with much and saw how sweet and adventurous anything could be in good company. my Christmas experience was crazy. I caught the flu running in the streets at 2 am. i got so farty that i was like iunterupting my own stories and that rare cuz i love telling tales of my own reality. its my cup of tea. and new years was funny. i saw my self just stepping back from being inside of me and looking at the whole scenerio and setting, surroundings and everything and just apreciating how beutiful everything was. 
  the party at 3 am was a pure men singing 80s songs together. not one lady free or floating around. and that was ok. hahaah .  
  what a vacation. the farthest i went this one was only sf. and only day trips, and sober and everything but i got a new refreshed perspective on things. man i remember seeing two old friends after watching others leave,this one friday and thinking wow just my day. as they had some california green and offered hits i laughed at how random life was, magical life was. i mean it was in suisun and after i spent a whole morning walking around with 3 super ladees in a perfect comunity to a creepy abandoned place, i see some two other friends just pop up to go to collins music store. and as they rebelled and puffed in front of all the construction workers i just stepped back and laughed at how precisely random and beatiful life is. gosh. im glad i got to know you all more. this vacation was just...        ( i make a face and start to tear) hahah inside joke huh Tiff!"

"event","hold on
hold on one second
that was just a poem was it
this is my journal
so abstract
the idea of me typing into a message box of elctricity
and that electricity flowing through others people message boxes
well not alot can see my box
not alot would read it
i definately wont read it
but if i did
it wouldn't be me
im not eternal
im constantly dieing and being born a diffrent breed
without being bread
bread is made of dough and im made out of carbon
bread is also carbon
how does the science of a electronic diary really expect itself to be understood like other terms and phrases
the tanacity
if only it made sense
but it makes no sense of cents
or scent to sense
it is just electricity to be seen by alot.


im pondering very shalowly im aware.
becasues im just wondering about what words mean
and not what life means
i would wonder what life meant in relation to live as a word but not the meaning of life just the computated dictionary breakfast of life
the breakfast cereal called life
you see
 i will do this for a while
till i am satisfied
and the highschool feeling leaves me
i must stop the music 
(i exit windows media player)
and now all i hear is the chatter of the keyboard.
no words from lyrics or soken through my head
im just typing now. what was so rich a setting now so dull
how weird and jurastic a change
of music and off none
of moon and of sun"

"event","i listen to music to help me undrstand my mood. right know im listening to radio heads lucky. i rember listening to it in highschool. 
highschool was a time that i felt so lost and alone
this night i missed out on a friend becasue she flakes
she must feel lost
making me feel alone
.
i dont understand whats gonna happen with me
when i was twelve i started eighth grade
i was supposed to meet her at eight
i feel like a pretteen loser boy
not becasue of missing out on her
no that doesnt even offend me
i just have this on set aura moving over me
.
it might just be the song 
this song might actually be affecting the way i ponder
the things of the past keep sneaking pass reality into
my threshhold of the present
things i rember feeling
are what i feel
things that i thought i have forgotten are
actually real"

"event","You know when people you've been friends with forever stop hanging out with you? That's what it is. Everyone goes with them. To hang out in their massive group of people, and me and Desiree are left with just us. Doing nothing. On a weekend. They're out, and we're wondering why no one's home. *shrug* Fine then.

It's not even that. It's that they move into the debate room and sit with us, having their own conversation and...making me be dorky, weird, casual Katie instead of pensive, quiet, debate Katie. I LIKE being my debate self. I like being witty and acerbic and dry instead of being giggly and loud. And, sure, I understand that it's not their fault for making me feel like I'm being somehow pulled back into their world unwittingly. It's just that I pick my battles. Some days, I want to eat with them and just be loud and happy and laughing. But sometimes I want to just sit around and listen to John Ward joke around and watch Matt Karam piss off Jason Crystal, and chat with Kern or have a conversation with Leala or something. Like, when I actually want to be loud and wild, outside of the context of school, going places and doing things...that's when they don't want to hang out with me. But when I want to just chill and not have people expect me to talk or something...that's when they invade my territory.

That's what it is. It's my territory. Originally, Desiree and I felt left out, so we just took on a ""fuck you all"" attitude and started eating lunch together in the debate room, having sarcasm wars and making fun of dumbshit people and laughing and having a great time. Going and getting a salad, then talking to Cuevas/Foster and observing things and having our own, quiet, running commentary of events. That was fun. 

And then people come in there and start bringing outside forces in. Like, all of a sudden they're sitting on desks having a nice little chat. That's not what happens in the debate room. You don't group up. You talk to everyone. It's one BIG conversation. Not several small ones.

It just doesn't feel right. It feels like I'm being torn between two worlds. 

*sigh* I have debate work to do.

- Bought Jason Mraz's ""Waiting for my Rocket to Come"", just to prove to Chris Davis that I will like his music for his talent and not just because he's sexy.
- Bought Rosanna Warren's ""Departure"" and ""Stained Glass"" (yay for poetry anthologies!)

- My bio reading (due to having forgotten my book)

- My bio urinalysis lab (because that's what zero period's for...)
- Anything really ground-breaking on that freaking English project. Blah.

<lj-cut text=""Somewhat debate-related rant"">Someone explain to me Ernie Rose's motives in getting me invited to chats. Because, really, it's fucking annoying since half the people in there dislike me or want to mock me or something of the sort. Here's a fucking newsflash: I make enemies really easily, which is why people like Mckay, Ashan, etc, think that I'm full of shit. Because I fire my mouth off about stuff, or do something toolish. 

Point of clarification: I <i>am</i> uninteresting and full of shit. I just don't see why you people insist on throwing that back at me.

FtBeLr: mckay wants me to invite kp
crazyaquarian101: not cool
Poisonicnuke: oh dear
FtBeLr: do it navot

Yes, marvelous. Except that I IMed Mckay and asked him if he was behind it, and he asked me what the fuck I was smoking. Which means that Ernie just wanted me there for some reason and feels the need to make BS reasons for his actions. He had Navot invite me because last time HE invited me I yelled at him.

That's fucking fabulous, y'all can have fun at my expense all you want. But don't expect me to be thick enough not to hear about it.</lj-cut>

I have to finish revising cases and start on some preliminary blocks.

Mom: ""What are you people talking about? Fish isn't meat, it's fish!""
Me: ""I can't understand how you Catholics can say fish isn't meat. When push comes to shove, it's still a dead animal.""
Mom: ""Fish aren't animals. Fish are fish.""

Me: ""Danny, you suck at life.""
*silence*
Danny: (a minute later) ""NO!""
(Keeping in mind that by brother is 6'2"" with spikes, leather, and a pink mohawk...yeah, it was amusing.)

Danny: (repeats lame joke)
Me: Dan, it's only funny the first time.
Danny: Nuh-uh. What Alex said was funny for like two weeks straight.
Me: You know what else is funny for two weeks?
Danny: (looks perplexed) What?
Me: Your face.
Danny: YOU SEE THE ABUSE I GET?
Dad: Shut up, that one was pretty good. 

Anyway. I was in a shitty mood yesterday until I got to talk to Lance on the phone after school.
Me: Aww, Lance, you make me smile.
Lance: Thanks Katie, you bring a grin to my face too!
Beckah: *gives me the ""you're-stealing-my-husband-so-back-up-off-my-man,-bitch"" look*
But anyway, Lance made me cheerier, even if Beckah thinks I want him. I don't, I just adore him in a brotherly, I <3 Lance kinda way. Lance is fabulous.

But today rocked me in <i>so</i> many ways. I started by taking a test...before 7 am. You'd think it'd put a damper on me. Nope. Fave subject = cheer. So the math test was easy, I felt like dancing afterward, and Katie and I acted normally even if we <i>did</i> kinda fight yesterday. All was good. Bio was long & boring, I slept through Mrs. A's lecture on the immune system and lymph nodes and whatever. 

Pac Rim <i>owned</i>. We did Japanese yoga and flame meditation in the wrestling room on kooshy mats. Then I went to history and analyzed documents for a DBQ...just getting back into my analytical writing mode...I haven't written a DBQ since the AP exam last year in Euro. But the DBQ, which was about women & the economic & political changes at the turn of the century, got me thinking. Thinking so much that in English, I just <i>had</i> to ignore the instructions and write something about it. It was entitled ""The Manifesto of February 27"". I'll post it here, despite its not being as much a manifesto as random social commentary. But I shared it with the class, and it just put me in a great mood. Plus the fact that I sit by Laura Shane and Jason Starr, who are hilarious. Meag wasn't there, she was cheering in Disneyland, but that was cool. During lunch Mr. Manes read my manifesto and told me that I have a career as a syndicated columnist...which was cool, and all, but somewhat odd.

Then debate...which was okay. I chilled in fifth, not really doing much, and then in sixth I talked to Karam, helped him do conversions and screwed with my calculator...and attempted to push Jason's backpack out the window. I failed, but it was funny anyway. 

Then I went to Foster's room after school and worked on some stuff before leaving...I got to hang out with Lauren and Elaine before they left with Shan. And they read my manifesto. It was great. 

Then dinner with my family, which was awesome because my brother and I were getting along and being all sibling-ish...and it was just a blast. Even if my mom was surly because we made comments about the hypocrisy of fish being meat...but yeah.

<lj-cut text=""The Manifesto of February 27""><b>""The Manifesto of February 27""</b>

A sexual revolution--for women, at least--is nothing new. This thought occured to me while walking here from history...that women had the revolution of the 1920's, with birth control, short skirts, make-up, drinking, jobs...and then there was the revolution of the 1960's--betraying traditional roles, free love, single parenting. But, always, the emphasis is on women, and <i>their</i> rights, and the emergence of a self-defined <i>woman</i>, separate from the patriarchy that has unwittingly oppressed her. I think we all know that my thoughts on the rhetoric of ""the opression of the patriarchy"" can be summarized with a resounding ""BULLSHIT"". But I question the legitmacy of sexual movements which focus on moving women into more ""manly"" roles--working, etc., while failing to move men to an equally ""womanly"" state for the sake of equilibrium. This was somewhat attempted in the 1990's through today, with the advent of the governator playing guinea pig and being pregnant in whatever movie that was, and the birth of the ""stay at home dad"", in conjunction with the media's current focus on gay men, ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy""-style. This is a step in a more positive direction, but is not nearly sufficient. 

Not to go Christina Hoff Summers on y'all, but I think that, historically, a sexual revolution's focus on <i>women</i>, to the exclusion of the other gender, has harmed men. I don't intend to take a stab at all guys, but the current condition--or mass portrayal, at least--of men as being brutish, sloppy, dim-witted, homophobic pigs is a <i>direct</i> result of the indirect oppression that recent history and pop culture has perpetuated. You see it everywhere, say, in TV commercials. The woman is the enlightened bearer of dishsoap or low-calorie foods, while the man is the belching and oblivious lawn-mower or plumber, who can't take care of his own children or cook his own meals. Our men, currently, are no better off then women were in the 1950's--when women were meant to mop and smile and raise shiny, squeaky-clean, overly-Aryan children. <i>Men</i> are now expected to play football, belch, be macho, and have a completely asinine lack of fashion sense.

We need a revolution for our menfolk, before the passive-aggressive oppression of the matriarchy is too much for them to bear.

I kinda have an aff case that needs re-writing, my neg is still an outline (whoo!) and there's SO much to do before Spring Creek. But that's cool, I'll get it done. I'll just have fun at SC. 

I want to see <i>The Passions of the Christ</i>. As a former Catholic, former pagan, and as a devout atheist.

And I want to see it with Matt Karam. Because I want to know his reaction to it. Because I want to discuss it with him. Because I want to squeeze his wrist through all the violent scenes. But mostly because I want to know his reaction to it, firsthand. Because Matt is a Lutheran, but not really. He is theistic, which is about all you can say about his religious practices. And he is somewhat Christian. He hates organized religion...as much as I do. And seeing his reaction would be interesting. I'm curious. I want to know.

I've caught myself thinking weirdly lately. I think my hormones get carried away, and make me think I'm feeling things that I'm not.

Because doing that sort of thing or feeling that sort of thing takes two.

In other news, I had a dream about Garrett last night. I still adore that boy, and if I end up going to camp with him this year I'll be majorly pumped. Because I still get fluttery thinking about him. Camp crushes die hard, I guess. *shrug*

I want someone to seduce me. To make me fall for them. To tempt me and then fulfill their unspoken promises. 

Sophie said something that made me laugh really hard in her journal. ""Crystal makes a pretty noise when you tap it. Just like me."" *dies* That was hilarious. Sheer genius.

In other news...

Today mi padre and I took a car test-driving. And it's not the kind of car I ever thought I'd want...and yet I love it. It handles SO well...and it's cute in a weird 80's sort of way. It's a 1991 Plymouth Sundance...with plush red interior. It's so fun. I love the fact that the inside of the car is like ""WHAM! WELCOME TO A WHOREHOUSE!""-burgundy. It's so very...me. The exterior of the car leaves something to be desired (chipped white paint...meh), but my dad promised me a full new paint job. And you know what? That car is getting painted either a bold, bright, school-spirit-y blue color (red and blue...haha) or a bold, bright, deep and gorgeous shade of PURPLE. Which would rock me in all sorts of ways. It would be like...the most pimptastical car of the millenium.

I drove up Mt. Rose highway until we were almost at the ski resort, then turned around and drove back down...that car handles like a dream, even around those tight little corners. It has an almost-new engine, almost-new breaks, AC and heater, and a nice stereo system. But the engine's not so new that the automatic transmission doesn't whine a little when you're attempting to kick it into second while roaring up a mountain. It's an endearing quirk. And plus, the engine actually roars. I feel powerful in that little car... Aiyiyi...

And did I mention that the inside is plush and BURGUNDY? Hahaha I'm in love.

I won't have it for a couple days at least...Matt and Carol (my dad's friends, who own it) are sorting out the deal with my parental units. But then...yes...that baby is mine. And that makes me 7 flavors of happy.

Okay, Desiree needs to get online so she can tell me what the assignment is for Busboom...because, yeah, I wasn't really paying attention today and so I missed that whole deal. Apparently our biographical thingy is due tomorrow? Mrmph. 

Done now. I <3 my car. I want it here ASAP. AAAAH.

Things I give up on: 
-Trying to write awesome cases on the new topic.
-Talking to Sonya without her getting offended at something

...yeah, that's it.

In other news, I got my license on Friday. Scannage of the license itself will happen...sometime today. My picture isn't <i>all</i> bad (I'm half-smiling, half-not...so that's weird), my hair looks fabby and my skin looks flawless, so that's a definite plus. I had to drive my brother to a friend's house right after I got home on Friday, then last night I had to run out and get food for myself and the munchkins. My conclusion: I drive much better when I'm not attempting to eat at the same time. *nods* 

Still, the sense of freedom I have is exhilarating. I mean, I just grab the keys, get in the car, and drive away. It's fantastic. =D

I have a sinus infection that hurts like woah. My entire face is sore, my ears have, like, massive pressure, all of my mucous membranes are inflamed and I feel generally crappy. Fun.

I'm on so many drugs right now it's not even funny.

Speaking of drugs, my brothers are royal fucktards. They got caught buying pot from kids at the middle school. And they did a bunch of stupid shit that resulted in them getting all privileges revoked...including privacy. My parents took the doors off their bedrooms. Stupid children. If you're going to do bad shit, do it WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT. That means removing the middleman. Not that I'd know. I'm the good kid. But whatever.

Okay, I think I'm done now.

"event","Every time I think about IMing him, no matter how many times I've done it before or how often I see him or how platonic a subject I wish to talk about...it gives me butterflies in my stomach. Let alone calling him. 

It doesn't help that I want him with a primeval, carnal desire that's like an ache from the bottom of my ribcage to the soles of my feet. It pains me that even stronger than that, surpassing that, is some suppressed and eager element of my psyche that thirsts to have him hear me, for him to speak his truth and let me sing it, to be acknowledged. It is unfortunate that the curves of his cheekbones and upward curl of his long lashes catch me off gaurd, that the sensuous fullness of his lips beckons me, that every tensing muscle and minute gesture becomes the center of my universe...

I paint him in a more favorable light than most would. To me, his sarcasm is endearing, his unique sense of humor charming, his crude representation of fact something to be aspired to. I pick up his mannerisms and make everything connect to him. I mention him often, and smile as I do. My mood goes from bitter anger to blind glee in a matter of moments with him.

Matt has braces. A scar from a childhood burn across his neck. Thick, warm, earthy hands. Often sporting a five o'clock shadow. Geeky t-shirts about computer programing with their esoteric humor. That, or political propaganda (very Republican, of course). A startling willingness to stick things down his pants or remove clothing. 

<b>I must be insane.</b>

But he is also the most brilliantly attractive person I have ever met. He glitters with wit and intelligence, his strong features fading from a poker face, stone-set for argumenation into a mirthful childish grin and chuckle. Everything about him is entrancing or funny or, at the very least, burgeoning with character.

At this point, I am drawn into believing that he is my ideal. And very few others may share that opinion in the sense that they are not personally attracted to his abraisiveness or crazy antics. But the vast majority can tell that we are similar and different in all the right ways.

Is this obsession? Is this another demon of mine to be conquered? A psycho-emotional evil that I must squelch?

Sweet obsession..."

<b>Berkeley:</b> 
Is not a traditionally fun tournament for me. Lots of drama happened, which will not be talked about...ask if you're so inclined. 
It was <i>long</i> and tiring. I was fully pooped by it...I went 5-3, with a weird drop to Robert June (Sehome) in round 8 (I don't think I should've, but then...I never do.) and two really legit drops: round 2 to Larry McGrath (it was bad. I was slaughtered.) and round 3 to Tisha Vaidya (a pretty close round with spotty flow coverage on both sides...not fantastic by any standards...but fun nonetheless. I <3 Tisha.). Picked up the rest. Saw various people from camp...Lana (one of my two Colleyville homies) was there from session 1, and Alan (Alhambra) and Liz (Kinkaid) and Steffany Oravetz were there from session 2. And Ms. Boyd was there, which was royally awesome. Plus Tisha and Sarah Smith and AT from DDI, w00t. I met some people I've always wanted to meet. Meg Watkins, for one. Shyam Ravindran. Larry. Oscar Shine. 

All in all...the tournament was a positive learning experience, even if it wasn't exactly ""fun"".

<b>Yesterday:</b>
In sixth, we're doing SPAR (spontaneous argumentation and rebuttal...like impromptu debate), and once Beckah explains it to us, Karam screams across the room: ""Katie, get your ass over here! You're my partner and we're gonna kick some ass."" 
I think I was obviously flushed as I obliged him and was his partner. We go aff against Kern & Alex Marko on ""life is like a box of chocolates"". And we (predictably) whoop some tooshie. It was astoundingly fun and cool and all manner of good things. 
Best of all was having Matt whisper arguments into my ear as Kern gave his pomo-eque 1N. Eee!

<b>Today:</b>
First off, I did all my homework. Kudos to me.

Sixth period, Matt and I talk and poke fun at each other with little inside jokes. I make an offhanded comment about sexual deviancy while touching his shoulder. He grins and laughs. 
He includes me in his little conversation circle with Kern and Shounak...at one point, Shounak flat-out told Matt, ""hey, you should bring Katie to prom."" Kern concured, and Matt and I exchanged glances before discussing the prank Shounak & Kern had played on Katie Vicks.  
After school, Shounak and Kern leave, and we keep talking about whatever (I'm pretty sure we were talking about drinking & drunkenness) right up until both of us decide to leave. I gather my stuff and walk out the door...Matt was waiting for me outside the classroom. We walk to the end of the hall, where we part, after exchanging good-natured goodbyes. ""Matt, I still think you should take me to prom!"" 
He turns around, shrugging and smiling in that oh-so-seductive way of his. ""We'll see how things go, I'll talk to you about it later,"" he responds, followed by a joke or a jibe that I laughed and retorted to...

It is obvious how much I adore this kid. And how giddy his attention makes me. There is nothing that makes my day happier than a conversation with Matt. It just seems that, of late, he has been more willing to initiate that contact. Which can't be bad.

<u><b>Something for the record books:</b></u> 
Before we left for Berkeley, I was asking everyone if they would be my valentine. Every novice, random kids in the hall, teachers, teachers' spouses, etc. I carefully avoided Matt. ""What? You don't want me to be your valentine?"" I looked at him, long & hard in the eyes, letting him know I was serious. ""Matt, will you be my valentine?"" He maintained eye contact, and smiled as he pushed the door open for me. ""Of course."""

Night before last:
I'm hitting Tatiana Cottam in a round, and she has some weird girl with folders there, helping her during prep. I'm taking my prep before my NR or whatever, and her timer goes off before mine. She accuses me of cheating when I say that I have 10 seconds left. I then ask her what the hell her problem is and she just stares at me. 
~Weird, because Tati is the nicest person in existance. 

Also night before last:
I'm sitting in the van with John, Eric, and Cameron, with Lance and Beckah up front. At Stanford, right? All of a sudden we hear a rumbling, and we ignore it...until we realize it's a massive earthquake and our van is driven downward into the schism, and the dirt piles in around us and I wake up as I realize that I'm going to suffocate.
~Just scary. I almost cried when I woke up.

Last night: 
I'm hanging out with random people at state this year, which is at McQ. The GV kids are bitching about wanting food, so I offer to drive them to get something at Jack in the Box or whatever. We get in my car and drive over there, where I commit credit card theft until the guy working there calls me on it and I pay in cash. I then get out of the car for some reason, and Kirsten (Max Stevens' girlfriend) and I are the only ones left at the window, where we eat french fries and laugh about something.
~Weird, because GV kids don't get along with Reno kids. And I've never talked to Kirsten before.

I talked to Kern for half an hour after school today. He was all bummed about competition, so I gave him a pep talk and cheered him up and offered to help him revamp the DX box.

Kern understands me. And I understand him. And he and I get along. I heart Kern. He's a good guy. Made me feel good about myself. He's probably the only person on the team where I don't feel like I'm constantly jeopardizing where I stand with him. I think I know. And that's a comfort. So yes, much heartage for Kern, who gives me boy advice.

Clearing at every tournament (whether I progress very far is a different story, but I've at least broken to elims each time), and the like. My streak has been broken. I didn't clear at Stanford. =( It's alright though, because the field was pretty competitive, lots of good people vying for those 32 breaks. 

<b>Day 1, Saturday, February 7</b>

First round I hit some fricking toolish girl from Bentley who has <i>no</i> idea what she's doing, who is not only, like, on the stupid side of the spectrum, but is also <i>psychotic</i>. She talks in that nasally, faux-mystical type voice (think Rachel Kaiser, folks) and has bad taste in clothing, has unwashed vaguely reddish hair, and wears too much Lord of the Rings-esque silver jewelry. She got owned. And she annoyed the fuck out of me. And my judge. How do I know? After her 2AR, she literally HOPS over to me to shake my hand, and is all breathlessly saying ""oh, that was a great round, blahblahblah I'm a dumbfuck, blahblah."" I look at her from my still seated position. ""You're err...<i>bouncy</i>. That's just a tad disturbing at 8 am."" My face clearly said ""You are fucking retarded, please don't touch me, you utterly plebian piece of trash."" And the judge cracks up from the back of the room. I'm sure it sounds horrible for me to say that, but she bothered me. Like, when I saw her again, later at the tournament, I totally ignored her. 

Round two I hit some chick from Cupertino. I run my case. She wasn't expecting my ""somewhat unique"" position (and you'll know <i>why</i> the quotes when I talk about round three. Feel the suspense.), had really nothing to say about it, was totally non-responsive, and couldn't cover the flow, besides. So during the oral, the judge give me glowing praise about how cool my aff case is. I felt accomplished, w00t.

So round three I check postings, I know I'm in top bracket, being 2-0. Finally I'm flight A, and so I check for opponent. M-Atherton JM, with Ian Richardson in the back. <i>Fuck. He's only top ranked in the country...</i> So I go to my round, shaking from head to foot, totally freaking out about hitting McKay. So freaking out I accidentally go to the wrong building, which happened to be in the exact opposite end of the main quad. I get there, I'm waiting, blah blah blah. Suddenly Sonya and two other kids (one of them I know, but can't remember his name right now) arrive and say that they are dying to see our round and they're flight B anyway and will I please, please let them observe. I say it's cool even though I'm freaking out, and wait for McKay to arrive. Finally, he does. And then our judge arrives. Is it Ian Richardon? Nope. It's Dimitri whatsisface from Irvington. Who happens to be friends with McKay. Shit. Okay, so I get up there and give the AC, all is good, in cross-ex McKay's a little rude and sarcastic, but it was humorous so I took it as such. He gets progressively worse throughout the round, at one point having to sit down, clutching his side, from laughing at one of his own jokes about porn (yes, literally). He ran space colonization. Which I had answers to. So I give a decent 1AR...not great but okay, kicking out of an argument in my case and going for stuff I could win with direct links to my standard, etc. McKay is a total ass. <b>(And, FYI, I know debate people read this, you can feel free to tell him that I think he's an asshole, he already knows I don't respect him at all as a person. Trust me, he's heard it before.)</b> At one point in the round he actually says ""Okay, so she does have kind of a unique case position, which is cool and all, but it's unique for a reason"". Yeah, <i>about</i> that...maybe if he hadn't said that, I wouldn't have felt like he was making screwy ad homs or that I had reason to be personally insulted by his conduct. So the judge discloses, he votes McKay up, etc. I don't remember (and neither do the others who watched the round) a definitive RFD. 

So here's why I'm pissed that I lost.
1) Sonya insisted that she would've voted me up because of his failure to extend his standards analysis. The other two people who watched agreed. 
2) According to people (and I'm not sure if this is actually true, but if it is, I'm pissed off even more), Dimitri was apparently joking after the round about how he signed the ballot before the round even started.
<u>Point of clarification:</u>
I'm not pissed that I lost to McKay. I'm pissed that I lost to McKay <i>because</i> he was McKay, not because he kicked my ass. Losing to McKay isn't anything to be ashamed of, and if he had taken the round seriously, I'm sure I would have gotten <i>royally destroyed</i>. But I feel like his conduct was unsportsmanlike and unprofessional. I feel like his treatment of the round was a personal insult to my integrity as a debater (as feeble as that may be) and I feel like he took an educational activity and made it into some political game where his name is valued over his words and where if he feels like doing something for whatever reason, it flies because he has that kind of authority. I was expecting losing to McKay to be a great educational experience, like I could learn something fantastic from it, with heavenly angel voices serenading the round and golden light flowing down, the whole shebang. Instead, it was a round that I got absolutely <i>nothing</i> out of except a feeling of being personally insulted, being irrationally angry, and losing all respect for John McKay as an individual. 

Round 4, I sit in the hall and talk to Julia, from M-A (McKay's school), about what happened third round. I'm somewhat comforted by the fact that she doesn't like him either. I flow flight A, debate flight B against Fremont Indep. (MSJ's pseudonym du jour) SD. No idea who this kid is, but the round was kinda muddled, which was partially my fault, but I won the standard and the flow was pretty clear-cut, so I came out of it almost 100% confident that I won, even with his random two new arguments in the 2AR. But the Catch-22 of it all is that the judge, a policy judge for whom flight A had been the first LD round in her judging history, stopped flowing. Or just flowed tags. Or something. It was just weird because I knew she COULD flow and I expected that she would...but no. So that might've screwed me, and considering the people I hit the next two rounds, the judge probably downed me, even though I was sure I won. 

We go back to Sonya's. I bitch at her for like an hour and a half about my round with McKay. She tells me to get over it, go to bed, and debate well on day 2. So I take her advice, and sleep.

<b>Day 2, Sunday, February 8</b>

Round five doesn't start until 10, so we got to sleep in. Rejoice. 

Second MSJ person in a row. Fremont Indep. DA. I ask around, finally finding an MSJ novice who tells me who I'm hitting, and Vinitha tells me not to sweat it. (Vinitha is an awesome person, by the way, I totally love her. =D We got flighted together once and checked out judges together {our second round judge was hott like woah.} and chatted in hallways and such. Great fun.) So I go into the round, judge says she wants standard debate, I win standard explicitly, opponent has a piercing, valley-girlish voice. I'm pretty sure I won, judge wouldn't disclose, but if I didn't win, that's just fucking stupid. (I won't get ballots for like four thousand years. Our team left before they were available. Bah.)

After this round I am just wanting to laze around. I ask random debater guy when they'll next post. He says 2. It's, like, 11:15. So I go get a sandwich, eat, drink jamba, etc. Cameron comes and gets me, and implores me to walk with him to get food. I do so, figuring I have time. We sit and chat while he eats, joking around, just having a fun time, etc. We come back, it's about 1:15. It seems strangely deserted. Maybe because they posted at noon. Fuck. So I check postings, see that I was flight A, and hurry my ass over there, where the B flight is about halfway through with their round. Cameron comforts me because I'm about to tear my hair out, then goes to tab and tells them, and I quote: ""You can't fucking drop Katie."" Cameron gets MAJOR props from me for that one. I don't even think he knows how much I appreciate it. Because, really, that was amazing of him to do. (In fact, he dropped his sixth round so that he could come and watch me...he figured he didn't need to debate it since he was pretty sure he was in the 2-3 or 1-4 bracket. I heart Cameron, he supports me. Yay.) He talks to tournament director, makes up some cock-and-bull story about our chaperone taking ill in this huge emergency thing, she okays me debating the round, they send out search parties for my opponent, I go and talk to my judge after the B flight is over, everyone settles in, and we debate.

Speaking of the judge: Vikrum Aiyer. I was <i>excited</i> to debate in front of him. Hella legit. My opponent...not so much. MVC JH (Justin Hsu, according to Patrick Gallagher). So this kid's case is incredibly simplistic, it's all rich-poor gap stuff. His responses to my case are TOTALLY erratic and nonresponsive. So I give what is probably the best 1AR of my life. I give him 3 or four burdens at the top, plus standards analysis and an a priori voter. I knock out his one card and its three impacts. That was his whole case. I extend my standards analysis which went untouched, then hit everything he put on the aff flow, extending my analysis past all of his non-responsive attacks, grabbing up large-scale additional impacts like causing perpetual warfare and genocide. It was great. In his NR he grants one of my arguments, which made Vikrum Aiyer almost laugh out loud and get a look on his face like ""okay, it's your funeral"". He tries to extend through ink and ignores two of the three burdens I put at the top, as well as the a priori issue. My 2AR probably wasn't as good as it should've been, I could've gone for a lot more, but I went for the arguments that directly linked into the standard that he had cold-dropped, and made my 2AR cohesive. Even if I could've given...8 or 9 voters? Eh, I'm proud of my performance that round. Even if it wasn't necessarily a great accomplishment...it felt really good, and I was satisfied with it. 

<b>Other things:</b>

Alyson, you'll never guess who I saw this weekend!!! Jason! Jason was at Stanford, and he and I talked about stuff. More like ""Hey, girl, how're you doing?"" ""Eh, I'm 3-1 right now."" ""Well, what are you doing wrong??"" ""Losing to McKay."" And he laughed. But yeah, it was great. I was reminded of my intense loving for the great Mr. Fernandez.

John and Eric went 3-3. =(

Robert Egan and I bonded. I think he actually might respect me now. Which is cool.

<b>A HUGE SHOUT OUT TO NAVOT, WHO CLEARED AT STANFORD AND WAS 5-0 GOING INTO ROUND SIX!!! YOU DESERVE THIS!!!</b> ...and I don't know results yet, since my internet's down right now and I'll have to backdate this entry later, but if you bid...I can only say that it's about damn time. Either way, congrats on the breakage.

My cases will rock everyone. Topic analysis lecture on Monday will demonstrate my love for the ultimate coolness of this topic. Um, yeah. That's a big change of heart. Heh.

I love the way I smell. My perfume smells, like, crazy good. Cameron was sitting on my leg during sixth one day, and he smelled my perfume. ""Katie, you smell good."" ""I know,"" I replied. ""No, you don't! You smell <i>really</i> good."" At which point he put his head in the crook of my neck and refused to move until I kicked him off.

I think I love being held too much. I used to think that I could fall in love with anyone, under the right circumstances. I used to think that all it would take was for me to feel safe falling asleep in their arms. But really...it's so much more than that. The last time I was in the arms of someone I cared about, cared about in a romantic way, was at state last year, with Kyle. I don't know why I cared or why it felt so good, but it did...and then he broke up with me, and I was lost. It was only two weeks. It was only a day spent together, laughing together, exploring Vegas and getting to know each other. I slept on him on the way home. Woke up to him. I was star-struck.

I should know when it doesn't feel right. It felt like friendship that I willed into something else, something that it wasn't, when I was with Bryan out of sheer loneliness. When I kissed him, out of sheer loneliness. When I stopped him, stopped him from doing whatever it was he was doing, and told him to just hold me...and he squirmed. It felt like friendship that I willed into something else, something that it wasn't, when I sat cosied up with Evan, letting him bury his face in my chest and wrap his arms around my waist...while I shrugged it off and continued a conversation with others.

I want something where I don't want to share him. Something where I feel the need to get as close as possible, to meld my body into his complement, to shape my soul into a receptor for passion. I need to strive for deeper feeling, deeper understanding every day. I need...I need to be in that race, pushing further, faster, harder, sharing thought upon thought, from the simple to the complex, meeting in like with reciprocation and comprehension. 

Matt gets me hot and bothered, no question. He pushes me intellectually. But I am as of yet uncertain if he is able to even feel emotion.

I'm going to go watch ""Sister Act"" with my mom now. Best movie ever.

I don't think that many of you understand what you're getting into. Sure, I have several nice features. Some may stretch as far as to call me pretty. And I speak in terms of innuendos, and I try my darndest to be seducable. I love the attention. I love the thought that I'm making someone crazy with sexual frustration. I love the thought that maybe I'm desired in some way, shape, or form.

You don't get it.

I'm the kind of girl who's in it to feel validated. I'm the kind of girl who uses boys to feel better about herself. I'm the kind of girl who wants to have fun and not really give a shit about your feelings.

But that's not the point of this post. The point is that I'm beginning to think in other terms. In terms of ""hah, I have to tell so-and-so this next time we talk"" or ""oh! that reminds me of something so-and-so said!"". I'll ignore the implications of that, because it's stupid to do otherwise.

I'm not a small person, which I don't think you know. I'm 5'9"". I have a pear-shaped body...which means I have a ghetto booty, to put it in terms of pop culture. And big thighs. Which isn't to say that i'm J.Lo-esque. It means I'm chubby. Granted, you get the benefits of my increased cup size...but I'm not some waif. If you've seen old paintings...think Michelangelo...and they have those women who are naked on a cloud, or something, with a pooch of stomach flab and pearl-white skin...that's me. 

Look. I'm not trying to make people think that I'm being down on myself or that I'm going to spiral downward again, or anything. I know that my body isn't always appreciated. Sometimes by myself, but most of the time I'm cool with it. 

I think I'm attractive. I'm just concerned that you won't. I don't want you to get your hopes up or think that I'm something that I'm not. Because that's my only inhibition. You won't be comfortable with me, and I won't be comfortable with me, and so nothing will happen and we'll end up just being friends.

I'll probably delete this post later. I just had to get things out there.

We argued politics today. Started ten minutes before the end of the class period, talking about propaganda. The bell rings, we're still going, only now we're talking about nuclear proliferation and national sovereignty. Our argument goes on, completely between the two of us, despite Duncan's attempts to put his two cents in. Until we're both pressed for time, a half hour after school ends, we just keep on talking. Cuevas has this huge, knowing smile on her face the whole time we're talking...we're both so into it, taking mental notes and maintaining eye contact for the whole period, oblivious to the people around us.

It was brain sex. And it was <i>good</i>.

I lost my intellectual virginity to Evan...in a church, at districts last year. We talked about religion and philosophy and laughed and argued and reached a mutual understanding. Then, again, a thousand times in other conversations. 

With Matt, it's like this glorious rush. Just talking to him I feel like I'm appreciated on an intellectual level and that any step I take, he can match or surpass. Plus, just looking at his dark, fantastic eyes or watching him run his hands through his hair or unconsciously suck in on one corner of his lower lip...that's nice too.

I just get so excited about things, when I have a great thought (however rare), and I have to talk about it. And Matt gets it. He'll argue the point, or if he agrees with it, chat with me about the hows and the whys and the what ifs. It's unspeakably perfect.

Is it horribly obvious that I adore our discussions? That I adore him? That I'm killing myself with wanting this?

Okay. New topic.

We started dissecting our cats today in bio. Ours is a pretty little calico, all black and burnt orange...Jenny named her Cecilia, with unanimous approval of the name from our group.

And then we skinned her. It was hard, and mediocrely interesting, but it was a cool experience. Now I can walk up to someone and ask, ""have you ever skinned a cat?"" and when they look at me, appalled, I'll grin and say ""I have."" =D

On the downside, my hands still smell like formaldehyde.

From DriversEd.com:
<i>Tailgaters often have a specific type of personality. They may be emotionally unstable people or might have been abused in their childhood by their parents or playmates. They may be uset about a work situation where their superiors dominate them.</i>

Child abuse leads to annoying tailgaters.

Best thing I've heard all day."

"event","I love Cuevas. She was very upset today after practice because of some teacher drama, and almost started crying when she said how she wanted to get home and play with Cole (her almost three year old son), but now she couldn't because she was too angry and it was getting dark. Her face was all pink and her eyes were reddened and shining with tears. I didn't say anything, just opened my arms. And gave her a huge hug and rubbed a comforting circle on her shoulder. ""Feel better, Cuevas,"" I say softly, letting her go, to find her grinning at me. ""Go home, and be nice to Cole."" She nodded and picked up her things and smiled. ""I'll see y'all tomorrow,"" I said before leaving, walking down the hall in a crowd of the novice kids and Cameron. 

I love Cuevas. I hope she feels better."

"event","I am having a delightful dizzy spell. It comes in waves of something like tiredness, but with a tingly, ultra-sensitized sensation. And I'm quivering. If you were to run your finger down my spine, I'd shiver and do naughty things to you.

------------------------------------
<i>my mother is a curtained window
dark and heavy velvet
drapes
behind which clarity lurks, tinged with the
amber-soft glow
of hatred and distrust.
and though the image seen is warped by fire-soft glass and
desperate blindness,
i curl by the sill and wrap
myself in the cold embrace of those memories
from when her glow was still 
warmed by sun.
and though i hate
seeing what images the raw truth of her soul brings,
i am unspeakably greatful
for the mere sensation of openness.</i>
------------------------------------

Matt and I have been weird lately. I have had an abundance of comments from third parties that he ""really does like me, even if he doesn't say so"", and that he ""feels the same way, but just can't see it yet"". Shut the fuck up. Please don't even mess with me. 

He makes me feel like I'm having one of those blessed dizzy spells, with just his mere presence. Yesterday, he's standing in the doorway to Cuevas' office, talking to her. I sidle over, standing next to him, and he moves to make room for me in the doorway. Being turned sideways, his hipbone was pressed into my leg...I lost ability to speak. I just focused on breathing evenly, and not doing anything that could be construed as sexual harassment.

Multiple days, today included, we have had funny little ""private joke"" moments, where he'll say something offensive and I'll hit him, and he'll look at me, faux-shocked, and hit me back. When I thwap him again and threaten with more, he grins and says ""But I'm a ninja. I'm too fast for you."" and then attempts to block my rapid-fire slaps. Before finally taking hold of both my wrists and laughing at me, taunting me with the fact that I can't move. And I squirm for a second before saying, ""oh, well. At least I like being tied down."" At which point he laughs and says ""eww"" (even though he loves it, really) and then while he's ""eww""ing, I hit him hard across the shoulder and then laugh and walk across the room. It's utterly hilarious.

And he makes these comments. Off-the-wall, random comments about having sex with me sarcastically and then making some witty way to twist it into an insult to me. And I laugh right back and call him names, and it's all in good fun. Melley spoke to me today about a bad habit of falling for the wrong kind of guys. ""Oh, I know how that is,"" I said, as I made direct eye contact with Matt, who was a half foot away. ""I have the <i>worst</i> habit of falling for pompous assholes."" He grinned. ""Ouch, Katie, that hurts me right <i>here</i>,"" gesturing to his heart. And we laughed. Laughed about it. The first time we've made jokes about me liking him in person.

He's so amazing. Fantastic. Attractive. Every day I find myself going numb with hope and desire and feeling. I find myself wanting something more, that I can't have. Lord only knows why. Sometimes I find myself wondering after him. Surely he's not <i>that</i> cute, <i>that</i> smart, <i>that</i> funny. I find myself rolling my eyes at his jokes and shaking my head. And then all it takes is for him to look at me and laugh at some witticism, or make an offhanded compliment about how ""every person in this room is so easy to fool, except Katie"" or something of the sort. And I'm hooked. Or he'll bring up an inside joke. Or say something hilarious. Or particularly insightful. Or ask me a question so that it prompts a one-on-one discussion...which he does frequently.

He tries to talk to me. He uses inside jokes to make me laugh, even if we're in a room full of people who don't know what we're talking about. He banters with me, listens to me. 

And I do and don't love it. It hurts my heart and head to realize that it's <i>just</i> banter, nothing more. And makes me float with hope for the fact that maybe it's something else this time.

Something more positive. I...have more debate work to do. Further case revisions, additions, subtractions, more blocking, more cutting...which isn't exactly the most positive thing.

<b>Note to self</b>: Call Eric sometime this weekend, re: Stanford.

Cameron gives me cuddles all the time now. Which is good, it's exactly what I need. Just a hug every now and then. But he was hugging me today, and we were just rocking back and forth, relaxing...and Cuevas and Foster start lecturing on us about how we're going to get ourselves into trouble, acting like that. Our response was very ""WTF?"". We've known each other for, what? 7 years? And we can't have physical contact? *shrug* Just a weird thing.

By the way, I heart Cameron. He got mad at me for not writing about him anymore. And he now has a journal. =D The one and only Carnizzle can be reached at <lj user=""ddrbpc"">. 

There, Cameron. You've been journal-whored.

With that, I'm going to go get something to drink.

saterday: eric challenged me to one up his meatballs, so i gave it a whirl. in the process i nearly burnt down the kitchen with a oily inferno that spilled all over the stove giving me blistering burns on my right hand as i tried to save the last batch of meaty morsels from the smoking pot with my chopsticks. from now on im leaving the oil and the meat to the italians and sticking to rice beans and vegtables and other less violent foods. 
later that night i enjoyed a good natured ""football"" game in which there were more red cards handed out in the first half than in the entire world cup so far, an american recieved a blood drawing elbow to the nose, and we tied one to one thanks to the goal that italy made on themselves. luckily, after the game we were all able to whipe off our patriotic facepaint, put our differences aside, kiss and polish of a crate of beer.
sunday: went to kati's braziallian cousin's gottingen penthouse which had a full on movie theater downstairs and a huge patio, both filled with yellow and green clad singing, sambaing brazillians all of whom burst out of the house and into the streets when they defeated australlia 2 to 0. during the after party i got to practice my german with tri lingual southamericans. who says learning cant be fun?"

"event","Last week i was in rome with my mother. rome was fabulous... my mother, not so fabulous. on the way back i spent the night in frankfurt with amy and her flatmates brazillian relatives. they speak not so good english and the previous week one had told amy that his heart was impassioned for her. that night he told me the same thing. latin lovers eh? i mean when are they not impassioned really? pause: through the same open window that is letting in the warm sun on this beautiful german summer evening are coming shouts of I-TAL-IA!  the italy/ghana game is on now in the living room, next week they play the US... that means war. or maybe more like playing steal the glasses from the athsmatic kid. anywayssss: this past weekend the weather took a serious turn for the better. on friday night we had a grill party (wurst, wurst, wurst with mustard, curry wurst and saurkraut) and watched the first world cup game. saterday eric made italian meatballs, i prepared the salad, we filled a liter cola bottle with wine and headed to the park for a picnic where he got a tic in his thigh that malbus had to remove with tweezers in a reverse drilling motion as eric screamed like a little girl. Sunday we went to the schwimmbad full of screaming, toeheaded german children eating french fries drenched in mayonaise. sounds gross, but its pretty good and the coolest thing is... once you finish the fries you can eat the container, its made out of waffer stuff. german people, so praktisch."

"event","Day before yesterday i was awoken at the cruel hour of 7:30 by a knock at my door. foolishly thinking it was a fire drill or something i pulled on a shirt and answered it. BIG MISTAKE. Before me loomed the very person ive been avoiding for the past week - my soon to be new flatmate Gabya Julius Tita, a cameroonian man with a lazy eye and a conviction that he is love with me. He proceeded to deliver a 45 min monologue over our future life together, completely ignoring my sleepy insistance that he could not possibly love me after meeting me once and regaurdless i wasnt looking to get hitched and wanted nothing more friendship from creepy guy with freewheelin, swiviling peepers. Later that day it began to thunder and lightning as the sun sunk from the cloudless sky and melted away behind the burnt seina rooftops. ever have one of those days where everywhere you turn everything and everyone seems to be a little upsidedown, insideout and backward?

The rude awakening of the that day was more than reqtified yesterday morning when i reached into my usually empty mailbox and pulled out an envelope shaped treasure chest containing a clipping from my favorite newpaper section, a runaway sheep and a few words that tugged my heart strings santa cruzward. the rest of the day i strolled along the streets of gottingen soaking up the 25 degrees (celcius) with a swollen heart and a smile from ear to ear, the kind that only comes from sun on your skin, or a friend by your side or, if you should be so lucky, both."

"event","wednesday: met the last two flatmates. micheal ""the spark of the flame"" and girl in zimmer 4 ""the ghost."" we had a cleaning party and discovered a colony of fungi in the bottom of the fridge, i think they may have been distant relatives of the fungi we so often found on the vegan food stuffs in the backhouse fridge (they send sam their love). following the cleaning party we went to an arasmis party at a bar in town where we danced until 5am (around 4 they started playing motown so of course i had to be pryed from the dancefloor). all danced out, erik carried me home on his back. somewhere along the way i lost my wallet containing 50 euro, my drivers licsense, bank card and student id. but i made 20 euro proof reading a paper thats coming soon to scientific magazines near you. glass half full right?"

"event","did you know that if you sign into to livejournal from an italian computer it will be in italian? yeah me neither. luckily the word post is apparently the same in italian. so yes im in germany. day six and i  still dont speak much. the town is beautiful... picture main street in disneyland, now add some bratwurst and donner stands and youve got gottingen. fabulous.

kauflicheliebe: it means prostitution. but the literal translation is love for sale which made me think of girlscouts selling love in dixiecups on the streetcorner and made me smile. 

im not too into the other uc kids on my trip save for one guy from berkeley so i have been spending most of my time with my flat mates. heres the breakdown...

Das Mitbewohners

Jorge: from lima, peru. hes rather shy but very sweet. he makes ceviche for the house every friday afternoon; next friday we are making pisco sours.
Christian: from bolivia. hes also very kind but sometimes in a bit of a sleezy way. today he gave me a chocolate bunny rabbit.
Erik: the younger italian brother (a libra, only a week older than me). He enjoys using american slang, or his version of it. above the kitchen sink there is a sign that reads ""wash your dishes or youre turbogay. (if you dont know what a turbo papa gay is... ask erik.""
Nils: the older roman. i get a big kick out of this one too. he treats me like a little sister and is constantly trying to teach me things be it new words in german, random historical facts about gottingen, or his personal favorite: examples of how most everything his bother says is bullshit. his 24th birthday is coming up for which the house is planning a toga party.
Beni: the token german dude. hes big and awkward and oafy with stringy light brown hair that hangs limply around his shoulders and totally loveable. he hates speaking english but usually humors me. yesterday when we were playing frisbee he had to bust out his inhaler. 
Tonush: thirty-nine-year old iranian guy. this one is really into involving people in intellectual conversations, but in a light hearted life long learner kind of way.
The Married Couple from Cameroon: i totally dont know how to spell the name of that country but sound it out and youll get what i mean. they are usually rather reclusive but are also very kind. last night the girl fed me a tradtional cameroonian meal, which was very good, though a little bitter.

so basically i am completly infatuated with all the residents of my dorm and am very happy here. there the introduction is finished. more is coming soon with pictures and other fun things, once i get internet for my computer. i hope i did this right.

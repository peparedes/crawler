"event","I cooked again today and made a truly wonderful chickpea curry.&nbsp; It's based VERY VERY loosely on a Butter Chicken recipe out of Madhur Jaffrey's Illustrated Indian Cooking.

Start by rehydrating enough dried chickpeas to make 3 cups.&nbsp; You'll also want a standard-sized can of chickpeas, the difference in texture is surprisingly nice.

Drain a&nbsp;can of stewed tomatoes very thoroughly.&nbsp; You can save the juice for drinking but don't add it to the recipe.
To the drained tomatoes add a cup of water and a cup of lactose-free milk.&nbsp; Puree with a hand-blender.&nbsp; Then add&nbsp;a teaspoon or 2 (I used 2) of Garam&nbsp;Masala, a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of lemon juice.

Secondly, mince fine a regular sized onion and brown it in a couple&nbsp;tablespoons of olive oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the onion is browned to your preference, add 2 teaspoons of Garam&nbsp;Masala (yes more) and 2 tablespoons or so of Dhana/Jheera mix and&nbsp;continue to heat for a couple minutes.&nbsp; The spices will make a dark brown runny paste.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then add&nbsp;about a teaspoon of minced garlic.&nbsp; Continue to brown this mixture until it all seems done to your taste.&nbsp; Then pour the tomato mixture&nbsp;in and stir.&nbsp; You may&nbsp;want to puree this mixture further to chop up the&nbsp;onion even finer.

Simmer for a few minutes then add the&nbsp;rehydrated chickpeas.&nbsp; simmer about 20 minutes or until the chickpeas are done to your preference.&nbsp; Then add the&nbsp;drained canned chickpeas which will be softer than the&nbsp;rehydrated ones.

While this&nbsp;simmers, melt a quarter cup of butter.&nbsp; (Yes, a whole quarter cup.)

Stir in the melted butter and simmer a few minutes more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tah-Dah, it's done.

I tried the recipe without the butter and it just wasn't as good, butter gives the sauce a&nbsp;almost-meaty richness and a velvety texture in the liquid.&nbsp;

You could serve this poured over rice or with potatoes but it's really not necessary, this is a meal in itself."

We have a really good room, about five steps from the door (yes really, that close!) ten steps from the nearest pool entrance ... slept really well, had the bed to myself with no-one to grumble because I'm what they politely term an 'active sleeper' (I move a lot while asleep.) We all woke up around ten-ish, sort of wondered what to do ... Scott and I went to Dennys for Breakfast and along the way found a 7-11, a Riteway and a Whole Foods all really close!   We stopped at Whole Foods on the way back and got a few Apricots and Tomatillos and a bag of mini-bagels,got Diet Coke at 7-11 for Angela ... and then spent the whole rest of the day reading, internet-ing and lounging by the pool for hours.  It was wonderful.  Now if only the rest of the convention goes as swimmingly."

The house is a split-level with a two-car garage (yay!  A shop where we can all breathe at the same time!) and reasonable amounts of on-street parking, the lower level was converted to a dance studio(!) and hair-dressing salon(!!) by the owners so we've got a huge, well-lit but private space for a computer room:), the salon is becoming the new office, there's also a guest bedroom downstairs, three bedrooms upstairs, very plain front yard, at least it'll be easy to mow, a back yard completely fenced in and covered in pavers (Yay!!!  No mowing, lots of bright sun for potted plants)

Anyway, I'll post a few pictures after moving is done."

It went on long enough that I was still awake when the guys woke up and headed to work.  I didn't want to eat for most of the day after that and realized in the evening it was because I was afraid it was going to start hurting again.  And then I chowed down on mini-oreos.  Thank you, <ts_umbra>

Over the weekend <cyberangel> had the urge to cook and so groceries were bought and Lactase tablets for me.  We tested them out via me taking two tablets and veryyyyyyy carefullyyyyyy eating a small amount of dairy and all was well.  So ... lactase tablets are going to be a regular feature of my life, I think.  I hate taking pills but I hate pain more.

I'm still going to be avoiding dairy though."

"event","The ever-so-patient ts_umbra took me to Trader Joes on Saturday, (with a stop at the Yakima Fruit Market first) and then to Uojimaya's.  So now I have some more soymilk info to add.

First, the price for soymilk by the half-gallon for the plain 'original' at Trader Joe's is $2.69, only a penny more than it is at Whole Foods.  So that's a good option to remember.  Second, Uojimaya's carries a brand of soymilk called ""Yeo's Soymilk and Fruit"".  Besides strawberry and 'plain' they also had Mango!  It's 1.99 for a size that's close to a quart so not a price winner ... but a very nice flavour change.

I've found some things at Trader Joe's, some lactose-free soups that I'll try and then rate ... but I see where their market niche is.  It's very much 'organic' but not so much 'alternative'.  They have a lot of things like organic butter, but very few soy alternatives.  It's just occurred to me, that could be due to the difficulty of confirming the soy products not to have GE soybeans in them.

But I'm still looking forward to the soup.

At Uojimaya's, I also found something called 'David Rio Chai' ... I've only tried one of the three packets I bought(Elephant Vanilla), but it was pretty good.  Might be a replacement for instant hot cocoa for me."

You have:
62% SCIENTIFIC INTUITION and
77% EMOTIONAL INTUITION 
The graph on the right represents your place in Intuition 2-Space. As you can see, you scored well above average on emotional intuition and above average on scientific intuition.Your emotional intuition is stronger than your scientific intuition. 	


Your Emotional Intuition score is a measure of how well you understand people, especially their unspoken needs and sympathies. A high score score usually indicates social grace and persuasiveness. A low score usually means you're good at Quake.

Your Scientific Intuition score tells you how in tune you are with the world around you; how well you understand your physical and intellectual environment. People with high scores here are apt to succeed in business and, of course, the sciences."

"event","We purchased Safeway's house brand of soymilk in original and vanilla and it is to YUCK!

It tastes like lactose-free milk, sour with a bitter undertaste.  It is oversweetened with a sugariness that becomes more pronounced in a latte.  It was on sale, two half-gallons for five dollars which is why I went for it ... but it's SO never going to replace 365 as my preferred brand.

Icky.  Still spitting out the taste!"

"event","<P><STRONG><U><EM>365</EM></U></STRONG> (whole foods house brand) is my latest 'test' soymilk. The color is the usual slightly beige, the flavour is fine,(it comes in the usual, 'original', vanilla and chocolate) the texture is about standard for soymilk (so still not quite as good as Silk) but the price was 2.63 regular price for a half-gallon at Whole Foods. Shocking, they're usually the most expensive place to find anything. I've also discovered what soymilk tastes like when it's starting to go off. It's this bitter undertaste that gets more and more pronounced as it gets more 'off'. And why, you ask, did I not just throw it out once I realized it was going off?</P>
<P>Well, because I'm like that. Oh, and a happy discovery: Coffee Mate liquid creamer is specifically labelled as ""Not a source of Lactose"". At least, the individual packets say that. I haven't checked all the flavours. </P>
<P>I had fun this weekend; went out with <LEO_HAT><lj user=""leohat"" />&nbsp; to a couple of second-hand stores that failed to provide what I was hoping to find ... but we found the mecca of garage sales.&nbsp; There was a community that advertised ""A"" garage sale ... and turned out to be a whole neighbourhood with about 20 different sales going on.&nbsp; I found a (way outdated but still potentially interesting) book on gem testing for <lj user=""cyberangel_"" />&nbsp; and len found a camp stove that someone had converted to propane so now he can give the white gas one back to his parents.</P>"

Well.  Tastes funny, like California milk.  It's milk treated with lactase enzyme.  It's organic.  So far, not a big winner because I don't like the taste.  I don't know if it comes in chocolate or strawberry or anything, those might be better."

"event","Okay, I've entered the realm of the obsessive here ... but I've been rating Soymilk.

Silk:  Comes in Plain, Vanilla and Chocolate.  The plain tastes like slightly sweet whole milk, the vanilla is FABULOUS, haven't tried the chocolate.  The texture is like whole milk, so is the color.  It costs 3.49 a half-gallon, so it's the most expensive one I've tried.

SunSoya:  Comes in Plain, Vanilla and Chocolate.  I've only tried the plain.  It looks and tastes like whole milk.  It's 3.25 a half-gallon

Pacific ""Enhanced"".  Cyberangel bought this one for me so I don't know the price or if it comes in other varieties.  The color is slightly beige, it's got a texture like 2% milk and tastes sweeter than the others.

8th Continent.  Comes in plain, vanilla and chocolate.  I haven't tried the plain.  The color of the vanilla is slightly beige but the texture is good.  Same for the chocolate.  It's normally 3.18 a half-gallon but I got it on sale at 2 for 5 dollars.

I can't remember the brand Jim usually buys, but I've only tried the chocolate.  I've seen it in vanilla and plain.  The texture of the chocolate is about the same as commercial chocolate milk.  I don't recall the price.


Other things I've learned:  Soymilk gets WAY ranker smelling than 'real' milk and it goes off faster if it's left out.  That little film in the bottom of a coffee cup that I wouldn't normally worry about washing until the next day?  I can't leave that any more.  It smells like boiled trash by the next morning.  The only thing I haven't experimented with doing with soymilk is freezing and thawing it.  That's tomorrow's ""cooking with soymilk"" experiment."

"event","Well, mostly the gas actually.  Heh.  You laugh.  But the lactose thing proceeds apace.  All those years of 'socially embarrassing gas' (Understatement.  Gas that would offend a Rhinoceros)and it's mostly cleared up and I keep feeling stupid about it.  Yes, stupid.  Like I should have figured out what was causing it ... that stuff is in everything, seems like.  I had no idea they actually use straight lactose to sweeten chocolate bars.

The jury is out on whether or not I should consider cheese to be a 'safe' food but I've already resolved that I'm not prepared to give it up.  I'd sooner give up chocolate.

But I'm trying different brands of soymilk.  So far ""Silk"" has the advantage that it's everywhere.  There's something to be said for the comfort of the familiar.  SunSoya on the other hand is not objectionable and is lower-priced than the other brands I've seen.  And I've got another brand to try soon, can't think of its name just now but it comes in tetrapacks.

All in all, this could be much worse.  What if it was caused by wheat?  I'd go in-friggin'-sane."

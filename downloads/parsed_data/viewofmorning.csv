Oh how I miss summer and wish it was here right now so I could be at the beach burning (for all that know me know I CAN'T TAN!)

I feel as though this semester was extra hard and the fact that I have to take summer classes really bums me out.

I wanna go somewhere for summer. I was spoiled last summer with cali, but now I have nowhere to go....anybody wanna take a road trip??? I feel like that is the only way I will be able to relax this summer is to get away from school, work, NEW ENGLAND...."

Needless to say with the lack of sleep I got last night I found this very amusing and laughed the rest of the way down. I went crazy. Couldn't control myself. Bus driver honked at me to hurry up this morning. Once again, I cracked. This may be a mental breakdown.

Signs that I am a little over tired 1)I got no sleep last night because of studying 2)I have been smiling and laughing randomly at nothing (Now this is not uncommon for me but I am doing it a bit too much today) 3)I am not tired. Actually I am wired. 4) The laugh/cry. which is it? A laugh or a cry? 5) I am not hungry. This is a sure sign that my body is too tired to eat, because I am always hungry."

CALIFORNIA. can't even explain how excited i am to be going back there, even if it is only for a week. me and molly had a discussion last night about how much nicer people are in california. solution to all problems is to move to california. period.

watched a possessed vending machine yesterday. the light kept going on and making a weird noise. it was funny to see people try to get their money in before the light went off and make their selection. people sure do love their afternoon snacks (i should know).

They informed me that the plane ride is horrible and I am not looking forward to my plane ride (first one that is) in January. But hey, anything to get back to Cali!
Had a lot going on this past week with being sick and family issues. I don't know but I don't feel like myself anymore. I need a good vacation to get me back into the swing of things. I think what I need is to see some old familiar faces. YES, that will cheer me up.

"event","Do you ever feel that it is too early in the morning to see/deal with someone. I DO!

Tips for staying out of embarrassing moments:
When at work, refrain from pulling up shirt to look at your stomach because maybe, just maybe, someone will walk in (like say the cute mail boy).
Also, try not to laugh uncontrollably when no one else is around. People who come and see you laughing at nothing may think you are crazy. (some people just don't understand the rewards of a good laugh)
And to end, try to stay on your feet at all times. Falling in public is very embarrassing and you get unwanted attention. (this goes for when you are drunk too)

Good old fashion fun includes changing people's away messages when they are not around, mocking people for pure enjoyment*, being mocked (hey if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen) watching tv with friends instead of doing homework, and laughing at EVERYTHING.
*Now by mocking I mean all in good fun, not to be taken or meant seriously.

"event","What an awsome weekend.  Me, Jenn and Danny went for a road trip down to San Diego to visit Becky! long trip down, but fun. We stopped off at a Jack in the box becuase that is the main fast food chain in Cali and everyone seems to be obsessed with it.

When we got to SD we dropped Danny off at his friends house and we found Becky.  It was 2 am when we got there so needless to say we went straight to bed.

Day 1: we got up, went to get bagels, and then headed to the beach. Yuck is all i can say at the amount of seaweed that is in that water. But it was warm so I guess it cancels that out. Later that night we tried to find something to do and we all decided on Club 911. Got all dressed up in our clubbing clothes, had a couple drinks (not jenn because she was driving, just clearing that up) and we were out the door. Drove around in a sketch neighborhood for about 10 min before giving up and going back to Becky's. 

Once back we all drank again and decided to go to a hookah bar.  To sum that night up, we smoked (a peach flavored tobacco with and orange head) we talked to some random kids and then we walked home.

Day 2: Becky had to work so me and Jenn explored Pacific Beach and napped until Beck got home. Then we ate dinner and went to a movie with Danny and his friends.

Day 3:SURFING!!!!!
It was everything I ever wanted and more. I had the best time in the world and actually managed to stand up.  Jenn gave up but Becky and I stayed in the water for the full 2 hours. I know that doesn't sound like a long time, but trust me IT IS. After surfing we showered and packed up to go home, which was very sad because I am in love with San Diego. I think I will live there when I get older.

Road trip home was fun. We made a pit stop in Bakersfield where Danny's mom lives and she made us dinner. After that we continued on our journey home and didn't get back until 2:30. long drive, but good time had by all.

4 days until I get the best visitors in the world. Can't wait."

So my summer in Cali just keeps getting better and better. Last weekend we hung out over Adam's on friday and watched office space, one of the best movies ever! Then on sat I drove, well i technically didn't drive, all over Oakland and such and then went to fentons with Jenn and Adam. That is some ice cream place let me tell you.

Our voyage continued up into the mountains where we over looked Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland and San Francisco. Then we went to a lake and relaxed for a bit.

Sat night there was a Rochdale party, which just means free alcohol.  So we got out neighbors and headed down to the shindig. Lots of random people setting off fireworks and being their drunk, most likely high selfs. Weird/awsome/sketch night.

Looking at away messages today and I came across Flutterby25trish's that said coffee.  Now if I were home and not on the other side of the country, I would be going for coffee too! Oh how I miss the coffee runs:(

Well time for me to start my day. I have BIG plans. For all of you who talk to me regularly, you probably have some idea what my BIG plans include;) HA"

"event","Oh the 4th of July...In California.....thought it would be better but here are some of the highlights:

1. Going into San Francisco- Good times
2. Losing the sister, being stuck in San Fran without money ready to sell myself to buy a plane ticket home- Could have been better
3. Going into Ripley's ""believe it or not"" museum- Interesting
4. Going to FUDDRUCKERS!!!!- Couldn't have asked for a better lunch (plus I got a cool dr. pepper bottle!)
5. Sitting in the park waiting for the fireworks to begin while listening to some live jazz- Relaxing
6. Having a little french boy basically sitting on my lap- Weird and semi annoying
7. Can't see fireworks due to massive amount of fog- Biggest disappointment
8. Getting lost on the way home, finding nice people who walked with us to the train station- Good
9. Having the 15 year old boy who was there hit on my 22 year old sister while I walk behind them and laugh- VERY amusing
10. Walking by a bus with an older woman standing in front of it screaming ""I need the handicap lift""- Sad but mildly amusing
11. Having to pee once at the BART and having no bathrooms..having to wait 45 minutes to pee- BAD 

So since the 4th there really hasn't been to much exciting going on in my life. I went to work on wednesday and had lots of conversations with extremely wealthly high school students. Gotta love that!

Going out to dinner tonight with some of the people from Jenn's work and then I think we are hitting up a club (Me + Club = Funny/Awkward).  They decided to forgo the bars so I could tag along....How nice:)

Oh well, only a few more weeks left so I guess I better live it up.

Until next time kids"

So Jenn got me a kinda sorta job thingy the other day at the bar....not working at the bar, just got me a job by meeting someone at the bar.  So I called up and got a job greeting high school students at the airport.

I get to the airport and I see my first set of students already waiting.....JOY.  I must say it was the most boring job I have ever had in my life. But hey I get paid for it and that is all that matters! I can say that if i never hear the announcement ""Due to high security, please observe all suspicious behavior and any unattended bags and call 911 immediately with one of the airport phones""

miss going to the beach and shit like that at home but I still love it here.  I shall return soon:)

"event","Lets see....so i made it to california and survived my cross country trip. In a car for six days with two other people fighting to sleep when u wanna sleep was a bit difficult at times, but i must admit that i can't wait to do the trip back! (i may skip over some states that we passed through just because they were not memorable enough!)

Where to start about our journey.  First while passing through pennsylvania, we saw a horrible car accident where a car flipped totally over and people were trying to pull people out of the car.  That was scary as all hell.  Next we passed through ohio where we encounter the worst thunderstorm that i think i have ever seen.  The rain was sooo intense and the lightening was so bright it was blinding.  After making through that storm, we proceeded on through iowa.  Now in iowa they had been having tornado warnings so i was not that excited to be passing through the whole state.  As we got further towards the middle of the state, rain and lightening began.  Then the skies turned black and the rain started coming down in buckets.  After about a half hour of driving in the rain we turned on the radio to see what was happening with the weather.  The minute that we turned on the radio we heard a breaking news weather alert that there was tornado warnings, and we were headed right toward them.  Just then, hail the size of golf balls started coming down and we feared that they would break our windshield.  Luckily, it didn't.  After the hail stopped, we looked up at the sky to see the begining of funnel clouds being formed to the side of us.  Let me tell u i almost shit a brick!!!!  We just kept riding through it and did not get hit by any tornados.

After that i was not very thrilled to be passing through illinois because they were also have tornado warnings, but nothing happened there.  Now on through colorado, where the mountains are INSANE and i loved every minute of it. After the mountains we went on into utah. Let me tell u, utah is the most boring state i have ever seen.  the exits were all over 40 miles apart and when they said ""gas off this exit"" they really mean ""gas 25 miles off this exit"".  We made it to the grand canyon where we walked around and i was scared as shit because it is a long way down.  My dad and sister made fun of me the whole time because i would hold onto the rocks with a death grip.  My dad even went as far as to point out an old couple walking on top of rocks. I explained to him that they have already lived their lives and i am still young, and i like my life to much to fall into a canyon.  After that we decided to shoot up to the hoover dam.  Cool place, lots of tourists like ourselves.  Then we preceeded onto nevada. NEVADA=DEATH. When i thought that i had already passed through the worst state ever (utah) i was wrong.  As we made our way through the deserts of nevada, something funny started happening to our car.  Then she died....in the middle of NOWHERE!! We got out of the car to see if we could fix it, but no one knew what it was, so we called AAA.  It makes me feel really good when AAA puts u on urgent because we were stranded in the middle of a desert and they didn't even get there until an hour and a half later.  We flagged down a cop who was driving by and as he pulled up we noticed that he had someone in the back.  YUP sure enough, he was transporting a prisoner.  Just what i needed, a prisoner who may escape and kill us all.

So the tow truck finally got there and picked up the car. Then i had to ride 130 miles on the floor of the tow truck because there were four adults in a tiny truck (mind u it was hot as all hell).  After we got to the dealership, they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it so we had to stay at a hotel for the night.  All i wanted to do was get out of nevada!!!!! So the next day we headed out as soon as the car was fixed, after being laughed at by all the guys there at how much stuff we had in that car.  We finally made it to our house in cali around noon time on friday.  What a relief, or so we thought.

Now picture this.....Animal house......the worst frat house ever and times it by ten and u have the house that we are living in.  All we did for the first 4 hours we were there was clean our rooms and the bathrooms we were to be using.  The people here are all hippies...not that it is a bad thing, just different for me.

Now i am all moved in and trying to find a job.  Hopefully i will find something soon because i am seriously lacking in the money department.


well that is all for now.....miss everyone back home (try to come and visit...u all need to see this place for urselves)"

Weird i thought as i strolled by, but not unusual.  The next day i am again walking on the bridge, this time back from class, when i see a chinese man staring over the bridge and had the same hum and pleasant look about him as the chinese woman had the day before. I have been asked if i mistakenly thought it was a woman one day and a man the next, but i am pretty sure they were two different people. I wonder if there is something so profound written on the rocks, possibly in chinese, that we college students don't take the time to recognize. hum????

Finals are kicking my ass and I only have only taken one. DIE CALCULUS DIE. The stress of packing, or lack of packing for cali is starting to get to me. The only thing that keeps me going is the fact that i will be spending the summer in cali (although i will miss the bury terribly :(......)

moving out day... fox hall..may 14, 2004- ""the elevator day""
     I was riding in the elevator like every other day of the year, when somthing seemed wrong.  As we approached the 7th floor to let someone off, the elevator door opened, the person stepped out of the elevator and the door closed. What usually happens is the elevator proceeds to move upward to the higher floors, but this time it didn't. It didn't move at all. Then all of a sudden it drops a foot before starting to move up. I was scared but was thankful that it was moving again....or so i thought. We made it to the 9th floor where another person got off and then it happened. The door closed and nothing happened. We were STUCK!!! I panic and press the call button where the person on the other end couldn't hear us and all they kept saying was ""hello, is everything ok"", me screaming ""NO, I AM STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR"". At this point i am turing white and starting to feel like i am going to pass out, fear of small places i think. After about 20 min i made my dad try to pry open the doors at which he did and they opened. I jumped out of the elevator like a bullet coming out of a gun and used the stairs, yes the stairs, the rest of the day (mind u i live on the 13th floor). I have since gotten over my fears and have been using the elevators, but have yet to conquer my fear of the ""right"" elevator.........

""Love is when you look into someone's eyes, and suddenly, you go all the way inside, to their soul... and you both know, instantly. I always imagined I would fall in love, nursing a blind soldier. Who was wounded in battle. Or maybe while rescuing someone in the middle of a blizzard, seconds before the avalanche hits. I thought, at least, by the age of fifteen, I would have a love life. But, I don't even have a ""like"" life."""

So i only had one class today, which means i napped. after my wonderful nap (like the kind u take on a warm day with a breeze, minus the breeze because i am 13 floors up in a dorm room) we, being me jenn jill and jamie, decided to cruise around in the jeep. u would be amazed at the honks u get when u randomly start head banging.

later that night i decided to go to the gym. yes u heard it correctly, THE GYM. i haven't been there in YEARS!(right candi). while on the treadmill, i looked outside to see a random boy walking across the lawn playing a guitar, like a scene right out of something about mary. good times.

ran outside through the streets of lowell at 9 at night. SKETCH. wasn't so bad at first until we passed the river where we heard the homeless people chatting. i felt like it was a scene from a bad horror movie were someone was going to jump out with a knife and chase us down the unlit path. didn't happen. i also love the people who beep at u while u are running. whats the point of screaming hey out the window to a bunch of runners who can hardly breathe?

With cbs bag of drugs in hand, i take the biggest face plant on the floor. Best part, my father said he knew i was going to do it but he said it was funnier to just see it happen.

I loved it. laughed till i cried. this was the first of many falls throughout the day. Use your imagination.

things i will not want to eat/do for a while:
1. Ice cream- i know this is sad but i am soo sick of it
2. Jello- never really liked it in the first place but when it is the only thing u can eat, it is like heaven
3. Sleep
4. Watch tv

things i want to be able to finally eat/do:
1. EAT ANYTHING SOLID AND OF SUBSTANCE
2. Use a straw
3. Drive
4. Have enough energy to hangout with friends


I miss everyone and thanks to all the people who came a visited me during my druggie stage!

peace out 
Danielle"

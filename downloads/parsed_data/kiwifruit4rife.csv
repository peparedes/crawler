"event","As the new year begins, I find myself looking for a new road to discover. Excitement. Adventure. Marmite. Distance from where I'm at now. I need something different. Something to test out all of the skills I've learned over the last year and a half. Something to affirm why I'm in the industry I'm in. So I did it. I applied for a New Zealand Working Holiday Visa. If it gets accepted, I've got 12 months to use it or I lose my chance for good. So if it gets accepted, I'm going. That's right kids, I'm going back."

"event","To start off, my dad is in the hospital. Again. He's got some infection in his hand and every time the doctors tell him he  can go home, the culture tests that they do grow some new unknown icky creature and they have to switch his medication. He's been in for a week. As far as hospital stays go, at least this time he can enjoy the TLC and the food...Apparently hospitals in Tennessee feed their patients Fried Catfish and Bar-b-que Chicken. Seems a little last-meal-death-sentence if you ask me but I didn't tell him that. :)In all seriousness, he's doing alright I think. 

It's just really scary because it's been too often in the last few months that I've gotten really bad news filled phone calls at wee hours of the morning. There's always that panic question of ""What if I don't make it there in time?"" I've been annoying my mother with constant phone calls over the last week, but why wouldn't I? I am the furthest family member away. I realize that whatever he has isn't life threatening and there is so much comfort in that and there is comfort in knowing that all  of the rest of the family is closer to my parents and this time I don't have the burden of all of it (my brother does, haha)but it just makes me wonder if I should stop trying to make it on my own and move out to Tennessee. I've thought about it for years, so I'm not sure what's stopping me from it. Things are work are getting better and I just rented out my Post Office Box for one more year, so maybe that's why.

In other news,  I went to see the musical HAIR last night. Lots of bad fake wigs and naked bodies and drugs, sex and the Vietnam War (all things 1968). It was fantastic. Although a bit shocking...it would have been nice to have a warning about the nudity... I felt worse for the guy sitting beside me that was there to watch his daughter perform...I really hope he got a warning. Funny thing though that it was performed by kids in their 20's for ex-hippies in their 50's/60's and a few well-off republicans (really not sure why they were there). I was quite possibly the youngest in the audience. Got to give all the actors props though you know? That whole ""naked in front of a crowd"" bad dream is bad enough. I'm not sure I could willingly put myself through that kind of fear....in fact I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't. The music was great and the actors were great and the theatre was this really tiny comedy club place with comfy chairs. 

It does bring up questions about our generation...the 60's were a time of activism and change and protest and empowerment, right? Granted, the amount of progress that came out of the hippie movement is questionable. What is our generation doing? Are we being activists and protesters? Are we fighting against the system at all? Is there even a common idea or goal that's bigger than consumerism and popular culture? Where is our HAIR?"

"event","It's been a really rough couple of months. My grandfather died. My dad's stepsister died. My dad's best friend died. My grandmother died. It's kind of hard to process. I went back to Mississippi in an attempt to see my grandfather before he passed and I was too late. My grandmother's funeral is tomorrow, and while I know it's not possible or rational for me to be there, I still feel like I should be. Like I'm being a really bad daughter and sister for not going. I'm worried about my mom, I hope she truely is okay and I hope that she really is okay with the fact that I'm not there. I'm not mentioning all this to get any sort of sympathy, but it's been a long time since I've written on this thing and I really miss everybody a lot.

On a positive note, the executive director of the organization asked me to help run a program about travel safety for 4 teenage girls traveling to Europe. I basically got to add things into the office manager's power point presentation. So I found myself remembering stories and giving out random yet valuable pieces of information. ie: if you decide to go skydiving tell someone before you do it, so that it's not a complete shock should something go wrong. When your friends rat you out as the american at a comedy show, just run with the embarrassment and take it as a sign of affection rather than be offended. :) I actually felt useful, knowing that my hard earned wisdom was beneficial to a future traveler, and my year abroad  was once again serving its purpose. It's been such a bad few weeks at the hostel and I've just felt icky, and I can't find much to take my mind off of all the sadness and  all the stress, and I was able today to put all of it away for a little while and knowingly give people tools to help their overseas experiences to be as good as they can be. It was nice to be reminded of all the things I did learn and how necessary that year was for me. The program this afternoon was such a small thing, but it was exactly what I needed."

"event","It's dawned on me that I don't have a clue what's going on with all my NZ girls anymore...even though I read live journal often...I'm so confused. Okay so who's still in Wellington? Kimmy and Jo are still in school? What about all the others? Sandy, Anna, Louise, Dan? And do I know any of the Sarah's everybody talks about? It's icky that I've lost touch so much!

So I'm currently sitting in my really messy room thinking about cleaning it and trying to use the computer to catch up with people a bit. The hostel is going through a major staffing transition at the moment and it's really great and sad and scary all at the same time.  As of Tuesday, I'll be the senior employee...scary. And because I'm the most senior staff member of a whopping eight months, I'll be acting manager of the place when the managers go on vacation in April...exciting and scary.What was really funny was my attempt at training cute surfer boy as a front desk clerk. Why the boss thought it was a good idea that I train him, I have no idea. I'm not sure he learned much.... I'm really sad to see the old staff members go, but I'm excited about the new people coming in. Two girls, my age, no relationship drama....But I hate having to say good-bye to people that I've felt so connected to for these last few months. Now I've got to start the whole friendship thing over with somebody else. It's the way it is in this line of work and it's really all I know I guess. 

I went through my travel box today and I read my new zealand journal for 2 hours today. It was very strange. It makes me wonder how different I am now than I was then. My marmite expired. I'm so sad.

My new favorite movie is The Science of Sleep, which I finally saw a few days ago...and I finally saw Kombi Nation...I love that movie! My daily life at the moment pretty much consists of hanging out in the office with a cup of tea in the morning, running errands or sitting on the beach, working, shopping with my boss, and babysitting her kids. It's a good life. The boss's kid considers me family, so I'm not allowed to leave anytime soon.

Last weekend, I went to visit The Lockary's. It was so so good to catch up and just sit in the recliner and watch movies with the family and the dog. It was nice. Homecooking, baking, errands, and hugs were definitely things I needed. It was still weird to look across the street to see other people's cars in my parents' old driveway, but a good weird. My parents are waiting for their new house to be built in Tennessee. It should be done in September or October. All this change is making me crazy. grrr."

"event","Okay, so I'm having New Zealand fantasies....fantasies might be the wrong choice of words. Last night I had a dream that I one day I just decided to leave everything here and fly to Wellington. While everyone I know was there, it was very different, everybody had changed, and nobody was glad to see me. Most were angry, in fact, that I really sucked at communication. Then there was that factor of leaving my boss here. Then I woke up. I'm still really upset about it.

So now I'm thinking about it all....how different are we all now? How have things changed in the last two years? How much of everybody's life have I missed out on? While I'm doing my best to save my money, I do know that getting back to NZ is a ways away and the most important thing is accruing  time and experience at the job that I'm at to prepare for future endeavors.

It always seems to come back to this for me....I'm so far away from everybody (and I mean everybody) that's important and the only way for me to deal with that is to not deal with it at all. Therefore, there are no postcards or letters or presents from me to anybody else. The realization hits that I'm a really really bad friend when I get a blanket in the mail, handmade by a friend's mom for me.

I've decided after a month and a half of debate, trial, and feedback from others, that I cannot break up with the friend that I talked about before. Thanks to junyr and others for advise about it all. The worst part about it all is that I never confronted the friend and they still don't have a clue that something is wrong.  I figure that it's really about me and I have to learn how to be more upfront about my feelings. I've just got to stand my ground and not let it all get to me. The more attention I pay to the situation, the more I realize that the things that the friend does and the way that they treat me has nothing to do with me at all. I should be more respectful of what they're going through and stop looking at how  they're affecting me."

I created a new breakfast delicacy....or at least discovered it...peanut butter and fried banana french toast sandwich. Brings back memories of Mike, right?

JJ found me though....

There is an odd stench coming from my room. I'm worried that something may have died in here.

I'm feeling better, by the way....I'm really really moody, how do people stand me? haha.

"event","Okay, wow I haven't written in this thing in a while. I'm been so enthralled by myspace.com and I started posting journals there. There is just so much bad energy around me right now....not sure why.  There's nothing tangible to blame it on, this lethargy. Well, that's not true. Maybe there are too many things to blame it on. The weather is so cold and rainy and gloomy. The hostel is empty and combined with the big waves, it's really very spooky. I wish I could just use a turkey baster to suck out all the bad energy through my ear....okay maybe not one that's actually touched a turkey. 

On another subject, I have officially stopped eating meat. I have crossed over. For one whole month now, I have not eaten meat. Although today I was craving a steak....it's so funny. I don't crave bread or pasta or potatoes....I crave what I'm no longer eating. Luckily, there are so many fake meat products around that I can still have sausage and it doesn't really taste any different than that which came from various areas of an animal. That's kind of frightening, isn't it?

There is so much drama here. I thought adults aren't supposed to have so much crap, but seriously, it's like I'm living with a bunch of high school kids again. Never date co-workers that live with you. It's just so bad. I say that as the boss has just officially found out about my giant school girl crush on the surfer boy. I thought that maybe it was going away, but then he didn't show up today and I was so dissapointed...it's so bad. So everybody knows except the surfer boy, I think. How is it that the one person who should know is the only person who doesn't know? OMG I'm such an idiot. And ofcourse now that the big boss knows, teasing will begin. Today the other boss asked if she could sing out the window as he walked by, ""L**** and **** sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G...."" Seriously. SHIT. The poor guy has no idea.

"event","What is strength? What is independence? How does a relationship or a partnership with another person add or take away from being strong? Who is more likely to be strong....the single woman working in a law firm, or that same woman in a relationship? I guess if she were a lawyer, she'd be more likely to be stretched too thin if she had somebody else to look after, but does that make her weak? Can strength be a term of relativity? One person that I see as amazing and strong may not prove herself strong to another person, that judgement being made based on the spectator's belief system.

What are the ways in which strength manifests? Is a person's strength based on experiences, beliefs, and life outlook, or are all those things the products of a certain kind of strength? 

To be independent....what does that mean? For as long as I can remember I've told myself to be strong, idependent and alone. It's better that way. Is thave even possible for me? I may not be romantically linked to anybody at the moment, but am I really independent? 

Everything I have is tied to the people in my life and in my heart...well and the hostel. In my attempt to be free of committment and responsibility, I've cornered myself into a position of constant interaction with and dependence on others.  Maybe it's really more of an intertwining exchange of dependency...a family unit really. I'm currently in a situation where I feel as needed as I much as I need from others. Does that make me less or more strong? I'm only as good as the people around me and the situation I'm in, completely a product of my ever-changing environment. Does that make me needy, adaptable, or disconnected? 

Can other people actually give you strength or does it have to come from your insides?"

"event","Sunday I used power tools for the first time. I cut a piece of wood with a battery powered saw...so cool. Monday was surfing. Tuesday I went to my first training for the library literacy program that I've just volunteered for. Wednesday, my parents and brother came out to visit and both Wednesday and Thursday we drove around, ate at cool restaurants, and shopped in cool stores. Today I'm taking my brother and Dad to the airport before going to work. After work I'm picking a friend up from a party in the city. Saturday is our big halloween party at the hostel. I'm going to be the lighthouse. Should be a pretty funny costume. Tuesday I'm going to see the musical Chicago. Yay!!! Tuesday is also the day that I have to come up with some sort of costume that will make me look super cute without looking suggestive, and really funny without looking dumb. I have lots of cute dresses, so I think I'm going to dress up in a dress, wear my polyprop pants from my one tramping adventure in NZ, my fuzzy brown boots with fur and pom poms, my orange jacket, and really cool sparkly make-up. I'll make people guess what I am supposed to be....that'd be pretty funny.

Things are as good as always at the hostel. I still don't know what to do about the guy though. Poor soul has no idea that he's the object of my affection. I'm really sure he's NOT going to be too happy when he finds out. It's only a matter of when too as my social circle is just too small and I think he's the only one that doesn't actually know. I'm such a 16 year old girl when it comes to these things. 

I wish all my friends were in places I could get to to hang out. There are just so many times now when I really would like to see an old friend. I'm realizing now that there are just some things that co-workers and managers should not be aware of, no matter how close we become. At the end of the day they are still co-workers and managers. I really need to stop incriminating myself with words around them. I have serious foot-in-mouth issues. I think it's permanently there, haha. The fact that I am so much younger than all my co-workers is also something I think about. I relate to them really well, but I realize that I am without the life experience that they have, gained only by age. With that comes a wisdom and lack of innocense that I have not yet acquired. So eventually, they all may get sick of me.

The wedding that I went to last weekend went well. My co-worker went with me and I'm so thankful for that. It was great to see some old friends but really weird to be so separated from them. I left for college and didn't stay in touch. Trying to come back to the circle when I've been away for so long just didn't work that well. Our lives are so different that we can't relate to each other. That love is still there, but there's a sadness and a distance that isn't readily available for articulation. Is this just what happens when we grow up and our lives separate? If that's the case, where does the impact of the friendship go? How do you remember that there once was a connection? I remember being so ready to leave Antioch when I was a kid, and even though I had so many friends and important things here, I really never saw any of it as being part of my future. When I saw people at the wedding, there was this hardness in people's eyes as though we were once linked, but now we are broken. It frightens me to to realize that I've been away from New Zealand for two years. That's far too long to be away from a person's closest friends. I realized on Saturday that my connection to the people at the wedding, though I will forever love them as family, is gone and maybe it's really just time to move on. I guess I should just appreciate what it all was and let it go."

"event","This morning for breakfast I had a chai latte and then didn't eat anything else, so I was sooo wired for about two hours and then crashed. For those couple of hours my co-workers were so totally entertained. I'm like the crazy kid sister. I sort of explained my whole life story in irrationally hyper terms and got so distracted that I didn't get all the cleaning done that I was supposed to. You really had to be there, but oh my goodness, I was hyper. So much so that I said some things that I really shouldn't have said and almost said some things that I really really shouldn't have said. I dropped a pumpkin on the ground and it splattered all over the ground. But a couple of hours later I totally crashed. It's really draining to be that hyper...I've got to figure out how to be more even tempered. It's really going to drive everybody crazy.

I attempted surfing for the first time yesterday....oh wow, that was funny. I really wish that I had another witness because it had to have been entertaining for somebody. But basically my friend that was kind enough to give me my first lesson would push the board toward the shore with a wave so that I could get a feel for my balance....It worked a couple of times and it was soooo cool! When it wasn't cool was when I lost my balance and flipped the board in the middle of the wave as soon as he let go of it...it's kinda freaky to be attacked by a wave. I totally want to try it again though as it was just so Freakin' Cool!

In other news, my faithful Toyota Echo, Bubbles got rear-ended by a big mean truck on Sept 1. Nothing terrible, just smashed the license plate in and pushed out the bumper on the left side...but it was enough to have to call the insurance company and deal with the crap. My first mistake was that I didn't call the police or file a police report. So now my insurance agent is trying to track down the other party's insurance and ofcourse the other party is claiming that I said that there wasn't any damage done to my car....so my birthday present to myself is a new bumper. It seems like a simple thing to remember, calling the police, but I really didn't think there was a reason to because everybody was fine. It's such a shame really that the police have to be called to make sure that people don't lie....shouldn't they have better things to be doing? What happened to trusting people and being honest and just plain being nice? I guess those days are dead and gone. It's not a big enough deal to get too upset about it as it could have been so much worse and it's only $500 for the bumper. I should be happy that the car is drivable and I'm not hurt. It's a good little car and I'm sure it's feeling much better now that it's had some TLC. I got to drive a rental car for two days and discovered that my insurance company rocks!!

Work is fantastic as always...NEVER EVER a dull moment as something crazy is always happening. Some people are really fantastic, and others are very strange. People really are an odd species....I wonder what the spiders think about us? I made my first fire in the fireplace at work two nights ago....I'm so proud.

Has anybody seen A Very Long Engagement? It's French with Audrey Tatou....It's really fantastic. I just saw it a few days ago. It's a few years old I think and it's set during WWI so it's really rough and hard to take, but it's so moving and even though it's so dark, it has the Amelie vibe about it."

It doesn't help that the people of the town aren't altogether friendly or supportive, so we've got to fix that and get the community involved.

Somehow I always manage to end up in really cool places in the middle of no where, surrounded by crazy people....but hey, maybe that's my destiny, haha. Yesterday we had a male guest that was clearly paranoid, liked to wear women's clothing,wanted an employee fired, and slept in his car because the government was after him. Then today we received an email from a potential guest that had talked to me on the phone that stated nothing more than that I have a sweet voice...very odd. All that being said, it's totally the perfect job for me, at least for right now. My managers and all the employees are nothing short of fantastic, so that makes up for the factor of isolation. Nobody's going to let me complain for getting to live rent free on a cliff overlooking the ocean at a lighthouse, no matter how isolated the location, haha.

He did say that there are a few other applicants that they are waiting to interview but I seem perfect for this job and I will hear about a second interview with his wife shortly! This is totally the job for me. I also got to talk about New Zealand a lot...cool stuff too like government and Maori/Pakeha relations and how my degree related to all of it...really good stuff. Seriously though, it's just a cool place to work and live and it's a light house...so if anybody's seen the Disney movie PETE's Dragon...it totally reminds me of that. I'm so excited, but I really hope it all goes well, because I'm really tired of dream crushing. And right outside  the hostel is a sign with all the wooden sign posts carved with the major cities of the world pointing in their directions with their distances....and ofcourse Wellington is on there! Yay again! I should send you all messages in bottles and see if you get them. We'll see how this goes, and my outfit was so cute...Sandy would be so proud! It's a brown short suit with knee length shorts, a short sleeved cuffed jacket, and a pink lacey shirt with brown pointy shoes (that kept getting caught on stuff and next time I'm totally wearing flip flops). Ofcourse the interviewer was in beach sandals, t-shirt, and shorts with really long scruffy hair. After the interview, which Cyndi accompanied me to and hung out at the beach all day, we went down the Pacific Coast Highway searching for cool beaches and I got really sunburnt.

By stage, I mean, make it look like a model home so that people will want to buy it. My parents' orginal decor is very country-like, with dark oak furniture and pink and blue flowers. The woman added lots of yellow, gold, and red things along with fake flowers and African designs to the traditional style decor. We now have this creepy looking elephant on the coffee table that stares at me sitting right next to this candle holder that totally looks like an urn that dead people's ashes sit in. So I've been going around the house changing things I don't like and my parents are getting mad at me...but then they totally like what I do better. They should have payed me the 1,000 dollars to stage the house instead of that lady. In her defense, most of her stuff is really cool and it certainly takes the pressure off my parents. The realtor is coming out tomorrow morning and by tomorrow afternoon, the house is officially up for sale. The front lawn still needs so much help, as does the back yard and the garage, but I'm pretty amazed at how far it's come.

Mike called!!!! I'm a very happy girl right now!! He's trying to convince me to move to New York! I think it's that whole getting away from reality thing again....anything to help me remember New Zealand.... It was really great to talk to him and what's this Anna about messages about toasties?

My sister is coming out to visit in two weeks. My mom called her up, told her to come visit and by the time the phone call was over, a plane ticket had been purchased. My parents are taking this retirement thing a little far...at the rate they are going they will run out of money in about 5 years, which isn't cool if they live another 40 years. My mom bought a new wedding ring, is planning trips to Hawaii, San Diego, and Branson, MO (don't understand that one). And my parents have rekindled their romance and are now constantly making out all over the house...it's cute, disgusting, and really funny all at the same time. The dog doesn't like it and follows them around the house barking in anger. They like being retired to say the least.

I'm trying to restructure (in his words) what was a potential relationship into a friendship with that guy and I'm just wondering if friendships are supposed to be really difficult to create and maintain. Some relationships are just so easy. My relationship with Mike for example is just really really easy. My relationship with Cyndi is really really hard to have, hard to leave, and hard to maintain but I still want it. I guess it's too early to tell if a friendship with this guy will be easy or take way too much effort, but one thing that Cyndi's taught me is that some people are just worth the effort. 

This past weekend, she mentioned to me that I was really difficult to befriend and I was really stand-offish and anti-social and didn't really change my behavior until I got back from New Zealand. She did say that it took a lot of effort on her part to be my friend but that it was worth the effort. That guy implied that my relationship with Cyndi is far closer than it should be and that it's really not normal. What's really funny is that I've never understood how to deal with our friendship and while I tell people all the time that our relationship is strange and sometimes unhealthy, I will it defend to the death to people like that guy. As far as Cyndi's idea that I was stand-offish, I think it's very interesting how two people can see the same situation very differently. I never discussed with her the problems I had with our friendship in all the years we've been friends, but a lot of that time when she was overbearing, I was retreating and trying to stay away from her without actually explaining that to her. The more overbearing she became, the more I retreated, and the more overbearing she became. I went through some hard times during those years that I didn't want her to be a part of because she didn't understand where I was coming from. My shyness and my need to have a lot of alone time are still things that she will never understand, and most people don't, and I have grown out of a lot of it. When I got back from New Zealand, I didn't like who she had become, but I loved who I had grown into. When Jeremy got sick, everything got pushed aside, and I really believe that he's probably what saved our friendship and I will forever thank him for that. So in terms of my other friendships, am I really that difficult to befriend and are other people that difficult to befriend? Because I don't remember my friendships in New Zealand as being difficult to create or maintain at all, and I know things weren't always peachy and great. I realize that I have a hard time letting people in, and as much as Cyndi knows about me, I'm not sure I'll ever really let her in. Then again, I feel like I let that guy in, but he didn't really get me either, so is there a difference between telling people everything about your life, and actually letting somebody in? Or is it as much the connection between the particular two people and the understanding by the recipient as it is the responsibility of the one who offers the story? My friends in New Zealand don't know the details of my life, but somehow they figured out who I was...in ten months we established connections that it's taken me YEARS and lots of pain and tears to establish with my closest friends here. Did I just imagine it? Am I holding on to something I should let go of? 

All my entries seem to center around the same ideas. I keep hitting the topics in a circular nature and I feel like I'm homer simpson stuck in a round-about in london and I can't seem to leave the circle. And yet, some how I think I'm coming up with good ideas and good conclusions. Really, I'm procrastinating and putting off life just a little bit longer. If I have any chance of having really good friendships with people, that guy or otherwise, I may as well let them in completely right? Writing it all down and articulating the crazy thoughts that don't often leave my brain iis just how I figure things out."

Last night was Independence Day (4th of July) and while I was supposed to go out with people, I accidentally slept through it and woke up after the fireworks were over. Oops...yeah I've been told many times that I am boring, but quite frankly sleep was much more necessary yesterday. This morning I took Cyndi's belongings to her grandfather's house, where she will be living when she moves back up to the Bay Area in two day's time. 

I need a goal. I also need a plan. I need a plan to get to a goal that I don't actually have yet. I need a big goal, an ultimate goal, and little immediate goals. I suppose it's now time to squish big dreams like bugs and focus on immediate goals, like a pay check. I have this habit of finding new dreams of grandure that I really can't do anything about at the moment, but they are fun to think about and I do love getting my mind away from reality, because reality really isn't so cool a lot of the time. And what ever happened to Beijing 2008? Heck, what happened to getting back to New Zealand by this year? Why the hell don't I have any goals anymore? 

And Jo, I know you said, no comments, but shout out to you anyway!!! That really sucks, so I can telepathically sit myself on your couch and help you eat Kapiti ice cream and watch silly girly movies as we trash the species of men!!! Again, it's really horrible and I'm so sorry!!"

I didn't put two and two together to realize that this meant stealing the boxes from the back of the store while no one was around. So Cyn was driving and sent me out to snatch them. So I thought about it for a second, got really ballsy and raced to the storage area, grabbed a big pile of boxes with the intention of running back to the car, dropped them on the ground and had to waste time to pick them up. I left a trail of boxes behind me as I ran to the car. Cyndi, meanwhile, thought I got caught and was contemplating driving away without me by the time I arrived at the car. 

I'm pretty sure that today is one year from the day that I last saw Jeremy before he died. It's a very strange feeling also to be taking his belongings to the thrift store without him here to tell us what we can and can't throw away. I just keep thinking that he would probably kill us  had he been alive when we were going through this stuff, which makes me laugh because he totally would not have appreciated our comments about some of his favorite possessions.

I'm again very unclear about what I want to do, where I want to work, where I want to live, etc. I'm seriously considering just finding a map and using the close my eyes and point method. I wonder what's in Portland, OR? Is there any reason why I shouldn't just pick up and move somewhere, really? I just found out that my friend Jane got into Colorado State like she wanted, so she is going there, SO EXCITING FOR HER!! But I don't want to move to Colorado. I kind of like the ocean and the thought of moving inland further scares me. Though, if I'm not careful I really will be moving to Tennessee with my parents. Cyndi is moving back to the Bay Area so I do have her there, even when my parents leave and a friend of mine is trying to get me a job where she works which would pay really well, though it isn't particularly appealing and it does have health insurance hich is totally the best thing ever.

Tonight I am going out with Cyndi, Ratika, and the girls to see THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, so it should be a very fun girly evening. Meanwhile it is really really hot and trying to pack up an apartment is not the most thing to do in 101 degree F weather, but maybe I'll get a nice tan out of it, haha. Did I mention that I drove down to Riverside for July 4 (Independence Day) weekend to help Cyndi move back up to NorCal? Well I am. I seem to be driving all over the place to avoid dealing with my own life. I may as well help somebody else out in the process right?"

"event","Last night was my father's retirement dinner with his closest friends from the office and his boss, my mother, and me at a really nice restaurant on the company's tab. Dinner was great, the cute valet boys were great, and the mango sorbet I had for dessert was absolutely amazing. The coolest part was being around all these people that know my dad in the capacity that I do, but better. It was amazing to hear stories that I'd never heard before, and even more amazing to be telling a story only to have one of his co-workers finish it for me. This to me was a true example of what friendship should actually be. These are people that have been through so much with each other over the last 15 years every day that they know the inner and outer workings of each other better than their own families. My dad's co-workers think he is absolutely amazing, with and quite possibly for all his faults and oddities that make him so special. The best part, ofcourse, was watching my dad's face turn bright red when his boss told me that he got really really drunk in Mississippi last year while they were on a business trip....I've never seen my dad drunk, but I kind of imagine it to be like my diabetic boss in the Grand Canyon who just got really hyper and hopped around like a bunny for three hours. As a retirement present, my dad got a metal detector. He's well known for picking up nuts, bolts, and other really random things off the side of streets and highways and has a really big collection of found items in the garage, so we all got a big kick out of that gift. He's been trying to work it all day long today, using it in the yard to find buried treasure. Isn't that just what we need while selling the house...giant holes in the front lawn....

I'm headed down to Riverside again this weekend. I seem to be on the go a lot lately. Hopefully this will be a successful trip and I can help Cyndi pack up her apartment to move back up to the Bay Area. It will be good to have her back up here,as it is getting a bit lonely. She apparently has lists of stuff she wants to do when she moves up here though, so I don't think I'll be without stuff to do when she gets here.

Has anybody heard from Andrew or Michelle? I'm not sure where Andrew is now and I think Michelle is supposed to go to Washington, DC for an internship next semester, but I haven't heard from either of them in ages. I tried to call Mike, but I got his voicemail and it sounds so grown up and professional and so unlike Mike. We are all growing up to be adults...isn't that weird? 

My dad was with his company for 40 years, not always having the same job, but still that's a really long time. He started his job when he was 23, straight out of college. That's crazy...I'm the same age he was when he started his job. I'm not sure I want to be with the same career for 40 years, and in this day and age I don't know if it's even still possible."

Someone else in the company covered for the interviewer, but basically, since she wasn't there and she's the one hiring, I got cheated out of a chance at the job. I never even got an explaination or an apology, just a guy from another department slouched in his chair that clearly didn't want to be interviewing me. Such a shame too, because I looked damn cute in my navy blue suit. There is something really cool about wearing a suit and watching the heads of middle-aged creepy men turn as a walk by (okay so really its just creepy). Too bad it didn't seem to have that affect on the interviewer (and if he wasn't such a jack-ass then I'd think he was cute)."

"event","After much thought, contemplation, and feedback from others, I really feel okay with what happened yesterday. I actually do feel like I handled the situation well for what it was and the guy's insecurities and hang ups ended the chance of a future, not mine. The reasons he gave me for not wanting to continue down the road that we were on are exactly the reasons I shouldn't want him anyway. He basically said that the distance and timing were wrong and he didn't want to put in the effort or let this get in the way of his life career goals. From the experiences I've had with all of my friends overseas and the situations that I've watched other people go through I've learned that if you really want something, nothing will get in the way of you achieving that. We all know that if you want to stay in contact with someone, you'll find a way to do it, even if it is really hard and sometimes heartbreaking. If you really want to be with someone, you'll find a way to do it, even if it means spending ten months with them in the hospital knowing full well that they might die...so the crap about timing and distance really all just comes down to a big fear of getting hurt and an unwillingness to take that risk and a selfishness that shuts people away. At the same time that this guy has been telling me to make more friends, find a hobby, gain confidence, he's been sitting in his apartment by himself watching movies unwilling to admit that he's just as confused about his life as I am about mine.

This morning, in a conversation with my dad over coffee, I discovered that I really do want a true honest to goodness friendship with this guy. While I thought I wanted something else, I really was looking for a bestfriend. It takes me so long to let people in, that we weren't able to establish a good enough connection before we crossed the line between friendship and romantic involvement. I'm at a point with all of my other relationships where they are all long distance and take so much effort to maintain, that I am in so much danger of losing them. I think I panicked in this instance and thought that if I tried to create a relationship with this guy, I could have a best friend that I wouldn't have to leave. This dawned on me when I realized that my favorite time spent with him was not snuggled up on the couch, but the first time I went up to see him, when we spent basically two days explaining our lives and establishing a connection were the best two days I've had with someone in a very long time. I drove home from that visit thinking that I'd just found my best friend. So maybe this really was a line that shouldn't be crossed, but it was crossed and things were at a point where it had to be crossed. Another friend told me once that things are only weird between two people if you let them be weird, so my goal now is to re-establish that friendship and get this best friend back. I really don't have a good reason to want a relationship with him, but I have every reason to want an honest and raw friendship.

I also realize this through all of this, particularly this morning, that I wasn't really heartbroken. I was dissapointed and hurt and confused, but it didn't really hurt the way that I was hurt by my high school infatuation. And it certainly didn't hurt as bad as when I returned home from New Zealand or when Jeremy died. Those were all instances when my heart actually smashed into a thousand pieces and I thought I wouldn't get it put back together. All this time I thought I'd never before experienced a real relationship, real love, or real heartbreak, but come to find out that I have, so mearly telling someone that I've never been in a relationship or that I've never been in love is really a very false statement and when I decide to let someone in, it's real and raw and I'm fully committed. I really do feel like I need to allow myself to enjoy who I am rather than hide behind this wall of insecurity. The qualities that show off my insecurites are really the qualities I love the most about myself and these are the qualities that my closest friends love about me as well. I'm real, I'm open and openly flawed, I talk too much and tell my parents way too much about my life, and I'm extremely analytical. And I'll never forget the girls' reactions when I went off on Sarah at my birthday in  '04 as I think it actually made my friends love me more. :)

Learning about people and relationships and how I fit into those dynamics is really eye-opening for me. It should be since studying groups of people is what I went to uni for. So this whole thing is really more interesting than anything else. It's really frightening to me to think about what I was willing to give up in order to commit to this guy, and the fact that one of my first thoughts after this happened yesterday was that I could move out of state, continue traveling, and plan to go back to New Zealand, should really be a tip off that this wouldn't have worked out anyway. The most eye opening thing about all of this was that everything that this guy brought to the conversation yesterday, I had already grappled with, come to terms with, and worked though months and weeks ago, but none of it was new. Every reason that I had feared in terms of his hesitancy to get involved in this was right on the money. There is some sense of satisfaction in knowing that.

okay I won't keeping hitting on this subject, I promise...I think I've got it figured out now :)"

"event","This past weekend, I went to Riverside and Los Angeles to witness graduations of very important friends, Cyndi, and Michelle. It was overall an amazing weekend,everything went off without a hitch and I got to see a lot of people and catch up on life. I felt amazingly really proud of both girls and was excited to witness such milestones for both particularly since I know just what they had to do to get those degrees. While in Riverside I got random errands done that I always do when I go there: I got my eyebrows threaded, my car washed, and went to my favorite restaurants. My friends thought it was hilarious that I was excited to go to Riverside just so I could get my eyebrows done, but hey...no one complained when I looked great in their graduation pictures! I also picked up my diploma finally, and I finally came to a point where I was able to feel proud of graduating from UCR. It finally hit me how great of a school it actually is, what doors it opened for me, and how blessed I am that I have that little piece of paper complete with the Govenator's signature. Also over the course of my visit I was able to clear some things up with my relationship with Cyndi and also come terms for myself with Jeremy's death. I think I am at a point where I can talk about him as a memory, somebody that won't ever leave my thoughts, but isn't a taboo to add to conversations. He still is in my daily life, thoughts, and actions every day, and I learned this weekend that that is how he should be now and his energy is still with Cyndi somehow. 

I have a job interview!! It isn't until Tuesday so I have 6 days to panic, haha. I'm so excited about it and I think it could potentially be really great!!

On a stupid girl topic, I got my butt up at 5am on Monday to make the trek back to Antioch so that I could see  that I guy that I've been on a few dates with now. I don't understand it...how could the last date have been so excellent and this one sooo not excellent? It wasn't bad, but I'm afraid we've entered the friend zone...maybe not...I'm still blaming Antioch and the fact that I hadn't actually slept in days due to the weekend festivities. But really I needed Jo courage...there were a few moments where I should have kissed him and I didn't, and he started talking about some other girl and asking if my friends are cute (ofcourse I said that you are all gorgeous). It's all getting really annoying and I'm getting kind of bored with it to be honest.

My parent's giant remodel of the house is almost done! All the floors are finished, and the hardwood changed the acoustics in the house so I've been singing really loudly all around the house today! And the dog got sick and puked on the newly carpeted stairs...my mom wasn't pleased, but I thought it was rather humorous. Is that wrong?

I got all sappy and reminiscent when I saw the photos from our 2004 road trip up north on facebook. Really how do I explain to people that think I don't have any friends, that I have better friends than any person could possibly expect to have (american and kiwi) and I don't need anymore because I can't get to the ones I have? I really have amazing friends!"

"event","Last night while I was talking to Michelle (UCLA) on the phone, she brought up the question: Do people change? I'm still pondering this idea. When I was sixteen years old, my english teacher asked me a similar quesion: Is change a good thing or bad thing? At the time, I said that change is necessary. We can't have life without change, we have to change, and if things don't change we can't grow. Last night I talked about growing up and growing into one's self rather than changing, but really what is it all and can it be separated out? 

Is it as simple as saying that somebody's changed or stayed the same? Circumstances change and life moves forward for better or for worse and we as people have to adapt to those changes. So are we changing or are we adapting? Michelle's little brother used to be as straight-edged as I am in terms of alcohol.He got to college, though, and now he's a regular party hearty bloke. Has he changed, is he adapting to his current situation, or is he just growing up and finding himself? New York Mike is another example. He arrived in New Zealand a partying crazy boy but by the end of his time there he was an upstanding Christian who had left all his pot smoking, binge drinking days in flat 401. Did he change or did he just grow up and adapt to fit an ideal that he had always had in the back of his head? His lifestyle changed, but did the actual personal character of him change? I'm not really sure. (We all thought he changed at the time because all we ever knew about his character was that he liked pie and there were 75 steps in the Mckenzies building....haha.) 

Is it simply a matter of being completely one way or another? Michelle, for instance, is not the same person that she was when she graduated high school. All the fantastic qualities about her in high school are qualities that are still with her now, but her outlook on life and ideas about things are much more broad, open, and easy going than they once were. She's grown into somebody that can be very matter of fact and know who she is, but can also allow for growth, change, and adaptation. But again, is that change or has she simply grown into a better version of her former self? Certainly getting out of Antioch and being exposed to so many new things, new trials, and new people is responsible for a lot of that.(There's a big difference in those who left and those who never left.)The college environment and lack of constant parental influence is part of that as well. My relationship with Michelle is also pretty great now. Is that because we've both changed or is it because we've both grown up and allowed for the growth of the other person? Then, ofcourse, there's that part of all of us from our past that never goes away. It's a piece of ourselves that as much as we would like to shake it, we can't and it haunts us and pulls us back into situations that throw out all that we've grown into,sending us right back to our former high school selves. There are certain people that cause us to revert back to people that we didn't like to be. So maybe change is situational. 

Personally, I wouldn't say that I changed during my year in New Zealand, but I did grow and I was exposed to new perceptions. I firmed up a lot of opinions about life, relationships, and human connections while I was there. For the first time, and in some cases the only time, many of my understandings and expectations of true friendship were affirmed, allowing me to come into my own just a little bit more. It was an extremely important part of my growth as a person. 

Perhaps, it is just that circumstances change and therefore we adapt. Through that adaptation and accumulation of knowledge and experience, we grow into really great, well developed versions of the beginnings of ourselves."

I should explain I suppose...although I think I've jinxed everything because I was so thrilled about the whole thing that I told everybody...and I still think I'm dealing with bad karma from years ago. Anyway, I finally was able to visit the guy that in past entries I've been too chicken to do anything about! Yay! And I must say, it was the best couple of days I've had in a really long time. He was so cute...he cooked dinner and breakfast, we walked all over the city, watched a couple of movies, and I don't think we stopped talking ever...how awesome is that? I think we both had a good time...we both said we did. And he acted like he did. So really why am I so afraid he's not gonna call? I mean really its a good sign, right that he cooked me breakfast and didn't want me to leave? So basically if he doesn't call, I've given him some sort of sign that I'm not interested, so it's my fault and karma's biting me in the ass again. But really it was so fantastic, not perfect, but really comfortable, and I had really begun to wonder if guys like that actually existed. Also I'm wondering if I've grown up, changed, or just settled for crushing on a guy that when I was 15 and 18, I really didn't have feelings for. It does scare me that I'm falling for an Antioch boy that I've known practically forever, but he's grown up, I hope I've grown up, and hopefully he'll actually just flippin call me.

Meanwhile, Operation Job Hunt Continues, my parents have officially retired, and according to the ALLIED MOVERS estimate for shifting all their stuff to Tennessee, my parents have 17,000 pounds of crap *ahem* sorry I mean really important heirlooms *ahem* crap.

And on a not so happy note, quite a few people that I love very much are going through their own really really hard times right now, lots of grief and pain. I wish them all the best and send my deepest sympathies. This stuff always comes at the most terrible of moments and no one escapes it. And everytime you think things can't get worse, they do get worse for somebody else. I will never understand why certain people's lives are ended so young, why people hate themselves so much that they think they should stop living, and why relatives can treat eachother so poorly after the death of another.

"event","Last night, my mom asked my dad and I to attend the Kindergarten (6 year olds) graduation of her very last Kindergarten class. Let me just say that I had forgotten just how much fun and entertaining little kids actually are, especially when you put them on stage and tell them to do something. Not to mention these are horrible little ghetto children monsters, but oh sooo cute, which makes it even more hilarious. It was very much something out of a movie or tv show where the teacher tries to get the kids to perform and they walk the wrong way, don't stand on cue, wave and yell to their parents in the middle of the pledge. My mom is an old soul and she's been teaching for a long time, so ofcourse she taught this year's class songs that are so old, but the kids love them. All the songs were songs that I remember loving when I was six....Three little Fishes....Six Little Ducks, etc. Six little ducks ofcourse was absolutely hilarious because there's a part in the song where the kids pretended they had tail feathers and stuck their bums in the air...then there's Go Tell Aunt Rhody. This was one of my fav songs as a kid, but it's not exactly a graduation song. This was the kids' favorite song and they all begged to sing it. My mom gave a disclaimer that she didn't pick the song...but really she should have been more careful about teaching it to them. If you've never heard the song, here are the lyrics:

Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, the old grey goose is dead.The one she's been saving, the one she's been saving, the one she's been saving to make a featherbed. She died in the millpond, she died in the millpond, she died in the millpond from standing on her head.She left nine young goslins, she left nine young goslins, she left nine young goslins to scratch for their own bread.Her goslins are weeping, crying and peeping, her goslins are weeping because their mammy's dead.The old gander's mourning, the old gander's mourning, the old gander's mourning because his wife is dead.The barnyard's a-weeping, the barnyard's a-weeping, the barnyard's a-weeping waiting to be fed.

Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, we took her in the kitchen and cooked her all day long.And broke all the fork teeth, broke all the fork teeth, and broke all the fork teeth, they weren't strong enough. Broke all Granddad's teeth, broke all Granddad's teeth, broke old Grandad's teeth. The old grey goose is tough.Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, the old grey gooseis tough.Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, we hauled her to the mill.We'll grind her into sausages and make mincemeat, grind her into sausages if only the miller will.She broke all the saw teeth, broke all the saw teeth, broke all the saw teeth,that old grey goose is tough.

Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, we know this is a shock.Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, we know this is a shock.But go tell Aunt Rhody, poor old Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody, we buried her under a rock.Go run and tell Aunt Rhody, run and tell Aunt Rhody, tun and tell Aunt Rhody,the old grey goose is dead.


It reminded me of the musical scene from JERSEY GIRL where everybody else sings a song from CATS, and then the audience is hit with shock horror when Ben Affleck's kid is murdering somebody, except that because this was ghetto Pittsburg, we were all laughing hysterically through the song."

The inside walls of my parents house are all freshly painted a neutral bone color with white trim, including my bedroom that I spent years decorating and perfecting, loving and hating. I boxed up all my memories, pictures and yearbooks, and got rid of all my dance costumes and prom dresses. My past of my adolescence isn't haunting me anymore. This is the closure I think I was looking for in coming back to my home town. My parents house isn't a scary place anymore that the neighbors all gawk at and my room is just another room in their house to use as a selling tool. It's fantastic really! Very soon, the house will be sold and we'll all be on to something bigger and better hopefully. I thought I was going to be upset by the painting of my room, but instead I felt nothing, which is just the most freeing thing. It does help ofcourse that I didn't actually have to paint anything. Suddenly the future doesn't seem nearly as scary. 

Yesterday morning, something happened that made all of this house stuff worth it for me.... The painter, Marty, was painting the living room window sill, while my dad was mowing the front lawn in front of the window. A nieghbor's dog got out of it's pen and decided to visit my dad while he was working in the yard. Arthur, sitting in the living room at the time, went bananas out of jealousy and rage and jumped on the freshly painted window sill, stamping oil based white paint all over the new windows, the carpet, himself, his nose. Dad was obliviously working in the yard with this new dog at his heels. The painter was holding Arthur by the time I got to him and wouldn't let me touch him because of the paint. I was totally ready for work wearing a nice red shirt, the only shirt of mine, save one, that wasn't wrapped in plastic, so I grabbed a towel to wrap Arthur in while Marty got paint thinner to clean off his paws. Arthur totally got paint all over my shirt anyway, and also the new granite counter top in the kitchen. The bathrooms were all being painted to I had to wash him off in the kitchen sink, which has a window to the back yard. Dad was still not paying attention and started working the back yard with the new dog following him around again! So trying to get the paint off of him was this giant adventure. So I went to work in the outfit I wore the day before, and my red shirt is now a painting shirt, but I would do it all again if it meant I got to keep the memory of Arthur tracking paint everywhere in his raging panic! It was the hardest I've laughed in a really really long time."

The painters are coming on Wednesday, which is really really fantastic, but also really really sad because my childhood room will be painted. I'm not sure why its sad. I've always despised this house, my neighborhood, my town, and I still do, but I guess its a finalization of something, an ending without a clearcut beginning in sight. You know, in talking with a lot of people my age lately, I've discovered that most of us really don't know what we're doing or the direction in which we're going. Why is that? Why is it that in a time with more opportunity, power, money, and technology than any other, we feel so lost and the future seems so unclear? Have we been given too many choices? There are so many options that we can't just pick something and be satisfied. 
So back I go to pack up my room."

"event","So we all know that my foot is almost permanently stuck in my mouth because I'm so beautifully verbally articulate. It's really a wonder I have any friends at all. :) You would think that if my foot is always in my mouth, that I wouldn't be able to say so much that is stupid, and then I say more. I realize that I only write in this thing anymore for depressing moments, but I suppose this is when it's most necessary. I wonder if change is actually possible or does a person always have particular characterists  that continue to hurt them and their relationships with others? I'm feeling really selfish and I shouldn't. I'm feeling very internal and way too absorbed in my own head. So what events actually lead to the predicament that I'm in? I'm not sure and I'm not even sure if it's a predicament. Now I think it was something I should have just left up to its own time, but it's something that needs to be confronted in order to be passed over. Sorry, this is all very vague. Is this even something I should be getting myself into? Too late now, because I promised myself I'd do my best not to hurt this guy again(okay so its about a boy) and I promised my friends that this wouldn't end up like a situation from my past. Unfortunately, it's already looking like that past  situation and I really can't put myself through that again. Not to mention that there's both something that's missing that should be there and something lurking behind a dark corner that shouldn't be. I am going into this knowing full well that I can't expect the guy to change at all and I do not have any idealized conceptions of him so am I creating a chase that doesn't need to be there just to make it more worth it for me? I don't know if the best thing to do is call this guy back and tell him exactly what's on my mind or if I should just wait this out and see what happens. I think I'll just wait it out a bit, meanwhile I've got to figure out how to handle the nagging girlfriend-like situation....she's now decided that we're moving in together and getting a puppy, and then there's my boss that thinks she's the keeper of my soul. How do I get myself into these situations? If I get myself into these situations I must be able to get myself out of them. As Samantha from Sex and the City once said in response to Carrie asking why she attracted crazy people, ""Crazy people have the best pills."" :) On a much more exciting note, Barry Manilow is no longer playing in the store...so now we listen to Rod Steward sing Sinatra hits (still sucks but anything is better than Barry Manilow)."

"event","The fact that I can't come up with a title for this entry kind of bugs me....maybe I should eat more blueberries. It's supposed to make you think faster or something.

So I've decided that I don't like gossip and drama anymore at work, well okay, I say that and I'm about to talk about it all again...anyhow...the girl that left the store because she was stealing money from the store is back. No one is allowed to talk about what happened. I guess she was exhonerated right or else the boss wouldn't hire her back? She tried to tell me what happened, but I asked her not to tell me...like I said, I'm done with drama. I just need to  hold out until I get a call back from one of these jobs I've sent resumes to...so far nothing though. It's cool though. 

It's really hot here now. So strange...yesterday, almost rained...today...80 degrees. It's great, no complaints at all!!"

"event","I fried raviolis today. They are so yummy. Yay for the food network for teaching me how to cook! My dad is officially retiring June 1. My mom is running away from her job on June 8. This means that they could potentially sell their house by August and I'll be homeless. I've had lots of offers from my friends' parents to rent a room from them and every family member I have has offered me a room also in various parts of the country...heck I even have places to stay in other countries. So being the frady cat me, afraid of committment, afraid of getting stuck somewhere I hate, afraid of never getting back to New Zealand, afraid of ending up like my mother, afraid of losing my independance, I can't seem to make myself move forward. It's called becoming what you fear. So now, to add even more confusion and decisions to make in the mix, I'm trying to bring a person from my past back into my life. I think I've really gone crazy now, but I'm really curious to see how this plays out, because it could potentially be really really good. This is a person that years ago I though embodied everything I hated about Antioch, and now I'm finding out that he's really pretty fantastic (and really cute but that's beside the point). In true Lydia fashion I'm overthinking everything and not really just letting things happen and making things much more complicated than they need to be. Job hunting is not nearly as hard as I'm trying to make it be. And ofcourse, two guys visited last week from NZ and AUS, feeding that travel bug that lives inside of me ands picks away at my soul. My life is fantastic really, I've had a really eventful few years, and I've been really really lucky, so why am I stalled? It seems to me that I should be more afraid of staying where I'm at than any type of future. I shouldn't fear what I don't know. Oh yeah, and I've been listening to Queen Greatest Hits for a week straight...it's really awesome!!"

"event","Today I worked in the Customer Service dept and the Children's dept. It was actually not a terrible day in comparison to some days when I've had to cover both, but  I did have a few incidents with little children when I felt as though I should have had rubber gloves, disenfectant, and an incident report to fill out. Besides the horrid boy that destroyed the department, there was a toddler that destroyed the department, broke accessories, and proceeded to bump his head on a glass shelf while his mother was paying for merchandise. Then there was the two year old girl that absolutely destroyed the department, pulled out bags, stuffed animals, followed me behind children's counter and into the gift wrap room, and then pooed on the floor after I had to tell her mother that there in no bathroom in the store. Dealing with the children, however, was much easier for me than dealing with the rude middle aged women that try to get lots of free stuff from gift wrap. So maybe customer service of any kind and retail are not for me after all. So I'm back to looking up lots of jobs and places to live. I've been cooking a lot, reading a lot, and trying to get myself out of debt. I think I can get rid of my credit card debt by the end of June which is pretty cool, and hopefully by June I'll have a job and an apartment by the end of summer, and then be on my way to saving up for some travel time...yay!! I have to learn to be patient since my other tactics havent quite worked, so I just have to suck it up and save some money. And I watched Rabbit Proof Fence, a movie about the half caste aboriginal crap programs  in Australia in the 1930's, and I HIGHLY recommend it! It's also nice to know that everybody's joining facebook now!! Wow, this is really a disorganized entry, isn't it? Fun stuff."

"event","Andrew and Michelle came out to visit on Sunday night. It was so good to see them both! They drove up and Andrew stayed with my family Sunday night, we toured around San Francisco for a bit on Monday before he had to be at the airport. It was short, but a fantastic visit none the less. I'm so happy that I got to see him. There really isn't anybody quite like that guy. My sister and my dad got to meet him, and he got along really well with my sister. maybe that whole German thing has something to with it. He brought Tim Tams and Snickers Hazelnut! Yay! He handed them to me and a little while later made me promise to share them with my family. Booo!

My sister was out here to visit this past week as well, and that was great too! We went to Berkeley on Friday, but mostly we stayed around the house. She was  trying to organize my dad's life with some new organizational system. My dad seemed to be feeling well enough to drive around and take everybody to the airport and play tour guide, but now he's really tired again. My room is finally liveable! It's taken four months, but it's finally clean! Yay for my sister!

Monday night I was already sad about Andrew leaving, and really starting to miss everybody in New Zealand all over again, when the Southwest Airlines rejection letter came in the mail. I was so bummed. I understand that everyone goes through this a lot while trying to find a job, and this isn't the first rejection or the last, but it still sucks. I think I do know what went wrong in the interview and quite frankly I just don't have that much interviewing experience, so I shouldn't feel too bad. Now comes the question, however, of what to do now? The reality of not getting back to New Zealand is really setting in, which stinks because I've still tried to keep it on the back burner. I'm getting career advise from all sides, which I do appreciate, and people trying to get me to move to where they are. So it's back to the drawing board for me. Strangely though, I've been having nightmares that my Southwest Interviewer keeps coming back into my life, making me wrap presents for him and cook him meals, so weird! I don't have too much time to be bummed because Cyndi is here this weekend and Michelle (UCLA) comes out here next weekend, so that should be fun!


Thanks Jo for the care package!! I pulled the kiwi out of the box and he made a noise and my dog came running over in hopes I would give it to him...go figure, all that chocolate in the box and he wants the stuffed kiwi toy. So now it's sitting on a really high shelf. But really, it was so sweet of you to send it!! Oh and Andrew gave me hugs from everybody, so thank you!! He actually gave me individual hugs from everybody and said, THIS IS FROM ANNA *hug* THIS IS FROM DAN *hug* THIS IS FROM LOUISE *hug*,right on down the line to everybody else!"

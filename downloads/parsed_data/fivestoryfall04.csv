"event","Well I haven't updated in a LONG time, sorry about that to whoever cares...My summer has been goin pretty cool, and everynight I do somethin this summer, I'm going to tell ya what crazy shizzle happened and put up a pic or a lil video or somethin.  Welllll first of all, I've been hanging out at the dock a lot with my friends. It's really fun there and have some nice lil talks and play some acoustic geetar.  Fall out Boy kicked off the summer and it was amazing, I'm going to their shows everytime they come now.  I went with Ryan and Kristina and saw robert and tommmy boy and keli and some people.  I also met all of em they're some purdy cool/short dudes.  I got a new boat! yayyy! just remembered that haha it's pretty cool in my opinion, 1987 27' Sea Ray Sundancer, sexy like a beaver humpin a lobster, if u can picture that...Haven't done a lot of stuff after that besides go to my dock and have fires and hang out with friends. It has been a cool summer so far, and here are some pics of my new boat and a lil funny video from my dock!

"event","Day after Easter, it was purdy fun.  I had a head ache all day so that kinda sucked, but then I went to Andrea's and my 2 budz Eric and Brandon were there.  They're cool dudes to hang out with.  We all watched Gothika, it was a pretty good movie.  Then Eric had to take brandon home so me, erica, annie, and andrea just sat around and talked about penises and you know, cool shit like that. Then I went home listening to some brand new! i LOVE the song Logan to Government Center...

Here are some pics of our band (five story fall)...this is one at Eric's apartment, kinda funny lookin haha

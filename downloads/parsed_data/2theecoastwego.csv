"event","I am in one of those moods were I am like soo happy I wanna cry. And nothing really has happened for me to be really happy. I guess I have just realized how much I like someone. I can be myself around him and not care what he thinks. Its an amazing feeling. My friends are the best I love them. They have always been there for me. Basketball is sooo much friggin fun! This year has been off to a really good start. Another reason I might feel like crying is because like homecoming is coming up and I really wanna go with him : ). I can't really think of anyone else I would like die to go with. The scary thing is to think that I feel this way, and he might not even feel half the way as i do. I don't get butterflies around him anymore, because I don't have to impress him. But everytime my hand touches his my heart melts. Its not even for a really long time but it makes my day. I have never felt this way about someone. Its upsetting though to think that he could be just another guy playing with my heart. I love looking in your direction and catch him staring at me, and he just looks at me and smiles. 

This entry was pointless but bad me smile and thats all that matters"

"event","<P>Friday: Woke up...started packing. Chelsea and Holly came and picked me up. Me and Chels had to baby-sit so we went over to her next door neighbor and waited for Evan to arrive. They ended up coming around 4*30. There were 4 dogs in the house. (the hepburns two dogs, Pongo--Chelsea's dog, and Evan's dog.) It was soo hard to move around the house with all of them in there, so me and chelsea just kept putting them outside. Pongo and the cat were going at it, it was quite entaining.So yea we had to make dinner for Evan so we made hot dogs and mac n' cheese. &amp; it actually turned out good : )..haha we had a good time&nbsp; cooking. So yea we went outside a flipped each other off the hamock haha it was great. Came in watched The Incredibles. Then by then it was like12*30 and the Hepburns came back. So me and chelsea had to call her Aunt Brooke she was taking us upnorth with her. So she comes and we pack up the truck. Head over to Brooke &amp; Josh's. Get all their things packed. Finally we got on the rode and we had to turn around and get the ski's for the boat. SO we go and grab those. Kelcee was soo cute that night. she was cracking me and chelsea up. She hardly cried on the way up there. Soon we get lost so we are just driving around.,..Chelsea fells like she is going to get sick. and me and Brooke are freaking out thinking she is going to get sick. and then Kelcee starts crying her eyes out. No body was answering their phones so we were screwed. we finally get ahold of Chelsea's grandpa. and her comes and meets us at an interesection to take us to the cabin. SO we finally get there around..4*30? yea so me and chelsea were tired so we get in bed....yea so we thought we would be able to fall right asleep.BUT oh no. her grandma's friends were in the bunk beds under us. and they were snoring like you wouldn't believe! i was laughing soooo hard. it was great. </P>
<P>Saturday: Woke up...it was HOLLY'S BIRTHDAY YAY!!!! So we had a pretty big breakfast. ate. layed around. Went out on the boat. it was freezing that day. so the water was like ICE COLD. That was fun. Brooke got up on the ski's! yay.So we get in &amp; someone has called me. so i&nbsp;call them back. and then he says that he will call me back..but never does..ergh. o well i suppose.&nbsp;Then me and chelsea came in a took a nap. Woke up...ate dinnner. layed around. Went to a camp ground so we had ALOT of warm water for showers. then on the way back. Chelsea's grandma thought she knew a short cut back to the cabin....yea..no she didn't. We are going through this like muddy area and we ge stuck. so Rissa, Grandma, and Me get out but Chels lost her flip flops in the muck. soo yeaa i tried to get them out for her...didn't work. SO she had no shoes. ..yea and we were like covered in&nbsp; mud. from like our shins down. and we JUST took showers. So we go back to the cabin wash off. and play cards.</P>
<P>Sunday: Wokeup. packed. ate. and out the door we went. So the walker's drop me off around...4*15?? idk ate dinner. layed around...and thats pretty much it.</P>
<P>TODAY:: I have basketball tryouts 1*00-3*00. yaa. so i gotta go and get red-ay. laterr</P>"

Woke up at like 3*30 got in the car. and left for tennessee. slept most of the way, cuz thats what i do best. So we go through Pigeon Forge and wow there were soo many damn red necks i was laughing soo hard cuz my dad was saying all this crap.. yea it was funny. Then like we got up in the mountains and my ears started popping cuz thats what they do in high elevation i guess. So then my phone rings and its Matt so i talk to him for like 10 minutes and then i started to loose my connection so i had to cut the convo. short :-( which was pooeyy cuz like i was bored and chelsea wasn't up yet nor was eric. So yea we get to the Resort and like we get our cabin. WOW i totally fell in love with this place. 3 stories->pool table. fooseball table. pac man/ galaga machine. 3 bathrooms and 3 jetted showers. yeaa to top it off a hot tub. so yea this was like heaven for me. So then we unpack and then grandma comes over and wants us to go to the BIG KAUHUNA with her to visit with everyone. Now i thought our cabin was big..not compared to this. It has 9 bedrooms and 2 game rooms filled with games and 3 dining room tables that could sit 35 of us. So yea. I was soo happy. Then yea my cousin had his HOTT friends over from New York. So that didn't make the trip that boring. So my cousin Lori made us dinner ...she is the best cook. god i love her. Talked some more then went to our cabin to relax and sleep.

Sunday__
We woke up and got ready..went into Gatlinburg i got an airbrushed shirt. its cute. and went to the Ripleys Believe it Aquarium. That was alot fun ..it took us like 2 hours to go through it. I got ta hold this like ""living fossil"" thing...but it was a small one. i couldn't hold the big one cuz like my hands kept slipping although tony could. So we got done with that and headed to the Big Kahuna. That was my cousins open house so we ate...alotttttt.  then sat around and talked. played cards. and yelled at people walking by (me and chrissy). So then we walked up stairs and like played ping-pong...then we went to our cabin

Monday__
Got up..ate...went into Gatlinburg...and like went to putt-putt on the mountains. i almost beat daddy..he is too good. so yea then we went to the Hard Rock Cafe and they did the YMCA on the table there. Then uhh went to the World Of Illusions. that was gay. i wanted this purse but mom was being a crabby mood and wouldn't let me have it. pooeyy. so yea then we went to the Big Kahuna and ate. went to the cabin.

I went over to Eric's with Chelsea. That was kinda boring cuz all Eric and Trev did was beat up Brooke and Amy. But it was quite entertaining. Then we played Texas Hold em'...stopped half way through.. then we sat around and talked about random things. Played basketball. Then I highjacked Eric's pride *n* joy--> his bike. Then Trev grabbed Brooke's or Ann's don't know..then we headed off for a bike ride leaving Eric and Chelsea standing at the end of the driveway . So we rode around the block...came back.. then Chels took Trev's bike he was riding and we took off for a bike ride. So Eric got fustrated and made us get off the bikes. : ( but thats okay it was fun to see him upset. Then it was time to go soo we go in the van and headed to Chelsea's house. It was 11*00 so we got on the computer..at Cheez-its & bagel bits. : ) our favorites. Then like it became like uhhh idk 2*45 and we decided to call big daddy wilkes. so yea chelsea calls him and his phone is off.. so then i call and he picks up. so yea we talked for abouts an hour and a half. gosh he makes me laugh alot. so yea he is in LAS VEGAS! gosh he sucks. Yea soo then i went to bed cuz chels was already sleeping. So yeaa today we are finishing getting stuff ready for tennessee and all that pooey stuff. so laterrr

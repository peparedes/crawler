I know we haven't posted in ages and it is with sadness that I am writing this post.

Today my good friend willoe went to the rainbow bridge. He wasn't unwell so it was a complete shock for my 2 foots to find him in the garden this morning having already gone to rainbow bridge. 

They asked the vet to do a post mortem as they couldn't understand why he had gone. The vet said that something had punctured his eye hitting nerve which caused an instant heart attack. 

I know I hadn't got on with willoe for a long time but I still admired him especially the way he coped with caspers death earlier this year. He used to love have free run of the garden except for the few hors a day Bailey and myself used it. He would run up to mum everytime she went outside in the hope of a treat and loved sunbathing! 

So now it's just myself and Bailey left, the meows and turtle and 2 new arrivals due to arrive in a couple of weeks tortoises oh and that noisy 2 foot baby who is 1 next month already! 

Please raise a carrot to willow tonight who will now join Casper and run free.

Saffie xx"

"event","&nbsp;Mum has just spoken to the vet and he said that Bailey had a good night and managed to chew his way through 4 drips which kept the vets on their toes!

He is going to let Bailey come home at lunchtime so that he is at home where it is less stressful but he has to continue taking some fibre supplements, and antibiotics, the vet thinks that it may have been an infection that has caused bailey to be so unwell and go into statis.

The vet did say that he is concerned with Baileys behaviour which mum has always noticed and commented on, he said that he didn't like the way he seems to go into a trance with his head tilted, as some of you will know when mum got bailey he was very tiny and the vet suspected that he was the runt of the litter and possibly had some brain problems. The vet is now thinking that it may be EC&nbsp;but doesn't want to take a blood test today as he said that it will stress bailey out too much and could cause him to become really ill again so he is going to wait 2 weeks and then take lots of blood from his jugular and test it.

The vet said that it was very odd that bailey was passing diarrohea and also hard droppings at the same and also eating yet still his gut stopped.

Mum has told me i must be nice when he gets back as he will need to be watched over.

Thanks for all of your vibes, we are keeping our paws crossed that he gets better over the next few days.

Love Saffie, Casper and Willoe"

He has had a bit of a runny tummy for the past 2 days but has still been eating and drinking and really bright but today mum decided that the diarrohea had got too bad even though Bailey was still really bright and happy to see everyone and me.<br /><br />When mum took him to the vet tonight the vet said that he was dribbling a lot which was a sign that he was feeling sick and when he listened to his guts he couldn't hear any sounds and his heart rate was too slow and his temperature was a bit raised but bailey was still bright licking mum and enjoying all the extra strokes. The vet said that baileys system has started to shut down on him and he is worried about the toxins that may be building up so he has had to admit him and put him on a drip and pain medications, mum is hoping that he is a fighter and thats why he is still so bright.<br /><br />The vet said i can't visit him and stay with him at the moment as he is too ill but has promised that if they can get some sounds back in his gut and off the IV&nbsp;they will see if i can stay with him as well to keep him company.<br /><br />I am really upset now and keep looking for him in the garden and in my hutch, mum has shut me in now as i was getting too upset trying to find him and she doesn't want me stressing out and going off my food.<br /><br />I really want my best friend Bailey back so please keep all that you have crossed for him.<br /><br />Saffie<br /><br />P.S It is Baileys 1st Birthday today as well!<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;Hi Everybun

We have had such a busy weekend, first of all on Friday night I had to go to the vets for my myxi jab and a check up from where my boys bits have disappeared, Uncle Hugh is very pleased with me but has said that my bottom teeth are growing too quickly so he has told mum to cut my veg down and make me eat lots of hay and excel as i don't like the science selective that the others eat that much. Mum also got me lots of wooden chews to try and encourage me to chew. Uncle Hugh was saying that he is a bit concerned about how laid back i am i sat on his table and had a bath and let him put something in my mouth with a light on to check my teeth, he didn't even have to fight with me or hold me down i just sat there. Mum also mentioned that i nod my head a lot so Uncle Hugh said that it may be a brain problem and that would explain how laid back i am but mum and Tim love just as much as before so thats all that matters!

For the last few evening Saffie and i have been spending some time together infront of the TV and today we have been together in my cage since lunchtime and mum caught us sitting together earlier, mum said that she needs to decide now whether to let us stay together tonight or not. Its quite nice being with Saffie although i do get told off when i try and chase her.

We have been having puwter problems this weekend so if anyone has sent us their photo to appear in the Journal Calendar can you please re send it to us if your name does not appear on the list below!&nbsp;The 2 foots have brought us a nice apple to use now to get on the internet so hopefully things will get back to normal!

Ok the list so far for the Journal calendar is as follows:

Princess Taz
Freddie
Bruno
Sweetpea and Star
Bella &amp; Greta
Hatty &amp; Austin
Una
Cedric and Millie

We still need 5 more volunteers to appear in the journal which we need to start work on this week so please let us know if you would like to appear in it!

Anyway of to have another sleep, being a young rabbit is such tiring work!

Does no bunny want to appear in the Journal Calendar this year? So far we have orders for it but only 3 volunteers to appear in it which will mean that they will be appearing on 4 months of the calendar each unless we get some more models.

If you would like to appear in the calendar all we need is one photo of you or you and your friend.

Mum had to sit an exam yesterday which she passed so that only leaves her with four exams to go. Saffie is doing well she has learnt how to move her food bowl around now and she now gets to come out every evening for some exercise. Willoe and Casper are fine and managed to get a nice play out in the garden whilst it wasn't raining yesterday, our 2 foot had to chase them round the garden to get them to go in their hutch afterwards.

Hope everybun is ok.

The answer is yes and although we are later than normal at getting them started due to all of our vets visits (you will be pleased to know that saffie is doing well and Bailey was fine after his little trip to the vets) we are now ready to take orders for the calendars. <br /><br />We have changed the designed slightly from last year but if any of you buns that had calendars last year want another one in the same design let us know and we will do one specially for you. <br /><br />The new design is the following, you can either have it on a plain background or a coloured background. For anybun that hasn't seen our calendars before you just have to send us 12 photos, by email or post if preferred, which can be of anything and we then make a calendar for you.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jerseymob/pic/00021t5t/""><img height=""240"" width=""170"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jerseymob/pic/00021t5t/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jerseymob/pic/00022ks3/""><img height=""240"" width=""169"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jerseymob/pic/00022ks3/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />The price including postage to the UK will be &pound;11 and if any of our friends would like one who live across the big pond they will be &pound;15.<br /><br />Lots of you last year asked for the journal calendar, so we will need volunters to become models for the journal calendar for 2009 as soon as possible, the first 12 will be selected with extras for the cover.<br /><br />We will also be making our fridge magnets and keyrings if anybun would like those for christmas presents.<br /><br />Willoe"

Uncle Hugh phoned mum yesterday and said that he was happy with how saffie was doing and said that mum could bring her home. She has a nasty wound that starts in the middle of her body and goes into her thigh. Uncle Hugh has said that she has to have cage rest only and in a small cage so that she can't hop anywhere as it would put too much pressure on her wound, he is going to see her again tomorrow to see how she is.

She has come home on metacam and baytrill but she hates the baytrill and puts a fight up everytime mum and tim try and give it to her which isn't good for her leg.

Mum's knee operation went well and now she has to stay at home with us for the week but can't look after us as she can't kneel and has to keep her leg up, the doctor said it will take about 6 weeks to heal.

Tomorrow mum says i am going to visit the vets and spend the day there i am not sure why maybe they just want to see how cute i am but mum says i will have a nice sleep whilst i'm there.

Uncle Hugh is very worried about Saffie and has warned mum that at the moment things aren't looking very good. The wound before they operated ended up being 13cm which wasn't obvious as her fur had matted over it and there was no blood on her fur, unfortunately they had to make the wound bigger inorder to tidy it up and clean it.

Uncle Hugh has managed to stitch her back together again but he isn't very happy as&nbsp;her muscles are too&nbsp;tight where there was such a large wound and lack of skin to use to stitch it up, he has said that she won't be able to extend her leg and if she does try to then then wound is likely to break down, he is also worried about the risk of infection now.

Mum is going to go and see her after work but we are all keeping our paws crossed that Saffie manages to get through this.

Its me Bailey, my mate saffie has had to stay at the vets overnight and today is having an operation because at the start of the week she and Willoe decided to have a big fight and saffie came worse off, willoe managed to damage her side and she has lost a lot of skin, the vet was saying that you can now see her muscle. The vet doesn't think she will be able to sew the wound back together again as its too big and the skin that was over it is now falling off and has died, so she is going to trim off the dead skin and trim round the wound to tidy&nbsp; and clean it up.

Saffie is fine in herself she is still eating and seems just a bit quiet.

Willoe hasn't got any injuries hes so lucky and casper got in the middle of the fight so he has a small wound on his tummy but that seems fine, as for me i am pooing all over the place and weeing on people, mum keeps saying she can't wait till i have my little operation on Tuesday!

Mum is having an operation on her knee tomorrow but has a bit of a cold so is hoping it won't be cancelled, the good news is if she has it she has to stay home with us all of next week!

Today lots of scary things happened first of all i got taken to a pet shop where i saw some of my sisters who are all twice my size now. Then a 2 foot picked me up and thats when i arrived at the Jerseymobs burrow.

I have met Saffie who is living indoors and has a cage next to mine, but not willoe and casper who have a huge mansion outside!

Saffie and i sat on the 2 foots lap saffie calls mum for a while this evening saffie tried to give me a quick nip but stopped when mum told her off, then we both got put on the floor and got to say hi to each other properly, saffie had a bath in front of me so i washed my face whilst she did that then she lay down quite close to me.

Mum then put us both in my cage and we sniffed each other and then we had a go in saffies cage, she ignored me most of the time but chased me twice but stopped when mum said no.

Now we are both in our own cages but they are next to each other so we can see each other!

The rumours are that mum is hoping that she will be able to bond saffie with him but Saffie hasn't heard about this yet and mum is hoping that she will manage it where saffie is 2 now and is having problems with Casper, Mum then plans on keeping them indoors and us in our mansion outdoors.

Mum says that she will need a name for the new arrival, she wants something linked to nature or that means courage, strong or brave where he is the runt. Does anybun have any ideas? He is very fluffy and pale in colour thats all the information that we have at the moment.

Will update more when we find out more.

I think i am in trouble every so often i chase Casper and give him a quick nip, on Thursday Tim cleaned us out instead of mum and he found lots of my fur and Caspers fur in one of our litter trays and saved it to show mum, then on Friday Tim came home to find me chasing Casper round our mansion and Casper not looking very happy so he put me in one half of our mansion and Willoe and Casper in the other half till mum came home. Mum decided that as it was such a cold a wet night i couldn't be on my own out there so she let me back with the boys.

But yesterday whilst it was pouring with rain and really cold and i was sat in a tray with Casper trying to demand that he gave me some fuss (by the way i don't return the favour and don't groom the boys back!) mum came and picked me up and took me inside where there was another cage and put me in it, i haven't been back to see the boys since.

The cage indoors is nice it has lots of new toys and a really comfy bed and some vet bedding to lie on plus its nice and warm. I heard mum saying that Casper has seemed unhappy recently and she thinks i have been picking on him too much as hes become quiet. They seem to think that it may be better if i live indoors with the 2 foots from now on and just see the boys when we get to play in the garden.

Mums not sure why i have started picking on Casper (i did do it last year as well and had to stay away from him for a few months but then i got better with him!) she is wandering if it could be from where we have moved burrows to Tims and also we now live next door to the animal shelter and there are rabbits that mum can see in there, she is wandering if maybe even if she can't hear them or smell them if i can and thats what is upsetting me and making me want to chase Casper after all we have been friends for 2 years now! Maybe wise maddie will have some ideas.

Anyway mum is hoping that i will become friendlier indoors and get used to having lots of fuss from 2 foots as usually i back away from them.

Willoe is having to stay at the vets again as he isn't very well again. He saw the vet on Tuesday for his eye check up and it was healing nicely so they let him have his myxi jab.

Today mum came to see us in the morning and willoe didn't want to move or eat so she knew something was wrong with him. She spoke to Uncle Hugh at the vets and he said that it sounded like his tummy was playing up again and he was in pain so take him to see them.

When willoe saw the vet he said that he was hot, de hydrated and by the time he saw him had developed diarrohea as well so she has admitted him and put him on a drip and started him on anti biotics. 

Mum says that it seems strange that he has been like this twice in a month now and says that there must be something causing it so has asked the vets to investigate if they can whilst he is there.

Sorry for not posting in a few weeks, we just don't know where the time has gone.

Willoe is feeling better since his trip to the vets but he has an ulcer on his eye thats been there for the last 3 weeks the vet gave him antibiotic drops but they haven't made it go away so mum has to take him back this week to see what can be done, the vet won't let willoe have his myxi jab until his eye gets better but we are going to have ours done this week.

Its been very wet and windy here the last few days lots of things have been blowing around the garden. The 2 foots were putting up a fence to try and stop us from getting out and down the steps into the car park but we are working out how to jump over it or go underneath it!

Anyway better go need to pester for our breakfast, oh but we broke our jingle ball last week so now have nothing noisy that we can throw to wake the 2 foots up!

The 2 kit too foots turned up today as mum has taken a day off work to look after them as they have a day off school as its the battle of britain air display today. When the boys saw us in the garden it was such a surprise for them as they didn't know we were here, they were so happy to see us and mum let us out to play with them and tiggers for a while.

Josh the oldest kit picked willoe up and gave him a hug which willoe has never let him do before but mum says that he still isn't right and seems very quiet but is also acting very odd and keeps snatching food as though he is starving even though he isn't, mum is waiting for Uncle Hugh to call her so she can give him an update and see what he thinks, mum was wandering if it could be to do with his blood sugar levels.

Anyway here are some photos of us exploring our new garden for the first time.

Lots of Snuggles

Its me Casper again, i tell you what having to keep typing up these messages is preventing me from getting my sleep which i do all day long, willoe had better hurry up and get better properly so that he can take over!

Anyway we had an adventure yesterday mum and tim came to see Saffie and myself and then we couldn't quite understand what we were seeing as they started to take our burrow apart and pack it up, then just as we were getting worried about where our beds were going we got picked up and put in our pet carrier.

Next we went on a drive and got left in the car on our own but when mum and tim returned they had willoe with them and he said that we were at the vets but they were letting him home, they had just given him his pain killer and stomach medicine so he was feeling good.

After another short drive we were put into our run in a strange garden and met a cat called tiggers who told us this is where she and tim live, the grass was very long and yummy so we all had a good munch on that and willoe had a long drink which pleased mum. 

It took 3 car loads before all of our burrow arrived at tims and then mum and tim have to put it all back together which took ages, but finally we got to go back in it but everything smelt strange so none of us felt like sleeping last night so stayed awake and checked out our new surroundings.

Mum was saying that willoes pain relief lasts till this evening so she is hoping that he won't be in too much discomfort when it wears off, hes with saffie and myself rather than on his own as mum didn't want him worrying where we are in a new place.

Anyway must go soooo tired after staying awake all night.

Mum has just spoken to Uncle Hugh at the vets and he said that willoe started to wake up during the night and pulled his dripped out to show he was feeling a bit better, he still isn't eating, drinking or poohing enough. He is due his next lot of pain relief and drugs for his tummy at 6 so uncle hugh is going to let mum then take him back to tims so that she can see how he does over night but uncle hugh as said that he will have to be syringe fed lots of fluids to flush the blockages through.

Uncle hugh said that he wants willoe to be near us in the next day or so to help him feel better but that means mum and tim now have to try and move us and our cages tonight as tim is going away tomorrow and mum is staying at his with the cat tigger so willoe needs to be there so she can keep a close eye on him. We can't quite work out how they plan on moving our hutches in tim car where they are so big!

We will let you know more once willoe is home and mum has tried to get some fluid in him! (Auntie Karen if you have any advice for mum on this please let her know including how often and how much for how long!)

Our best friend willoe is having to stay at the vets tonight, Mum and Tim came to feed us this afternoon and willoe didn't come out to see them like he normally does for his treat and mum found him lying on his side not moving in part of our cage that none of normally use apart from saffie for making nests. Mum picked him up but he didn't fight her like normal and just lay in her arms and then tims so he had to go to the vets.

The vet said that he is in a lot of discomfort and has a compacted stomach and slight temperature, so took him away to put him on a drip and give him pain relief and something to make his tummy work again. 

We miss willoe lots already and he has to get better soon as we are going to be moving to tims at the end of the month now that he has put an engagement ring on mums finger! We can't wait to see out new hutch and want willoe to be with us as well.

Mum says she is worried that saffie might be nasty to willoe when he gets back like she was to me after i had had to stay in at the vets.

We hope everybun else is well and we are sorry for not posting in a while but it will be easier once we move to tims.

Lots of snuggles

We have had an eventful day today as it was Saffies 2nd Birthday, tomorrow is Caspers 4th Birthday aren't we both lucky bunnies to have been born in such a nice month!

This evening mum came home with her arm in something called a sling, she does look funny especially as she had to have help from one of Tim;s kits to feed us and let us out and tim had to help her get us back in. Aparently mum had to go to a&e today as last night she hurt her shoulder and the 2 foot vet at a&e told her she has torn her shoulder yet we can't see any tear marks on it. Mum seems to be in a lot of pain so to help it and as it was her birthday saffie made mum chase her round the garden to get her in!

Anyway hope everyone is ok especially princess taz.

Lots of snuggles

How is everybun doing?

Sorry for not posting for a long time, we have just been so busy dozing aroung in the sun and hiding from the rain these days we don't know where the time goes.

We have so many 2 foots coming to see us these days we can't keep track and Casper is complaining as all he wants to do is sleep all day and night long in his bed but mum makes him get up for a hop around the garden, but at least he is happy because he has more visitors it means more treats! Mum has been seeing a 2 foot called Tim for the last month and seams extra happy at the moment, they have even said that we may be moving to his borrow at some point towards the end of the year and they have even been looking at rings (we are not sure what that is about!)Tim has 2 small 2 foots who come to see us sometimes as well, they are nice and don't chase us or anything we just don't like it when they are kicking a ball around the garden. We have trained Tim up already to bring us greens (silly 2 foots call them weeds) from his garden the only complaint we have about him is that when mum chops our salad up in the evening he pinches some of our carrot sticks!

Anyway as we aren't on here as much these days what we wanted to say was if anyone wants to they can keep in touch with us by email or as we are modern bunnies we also use SKYPE and MSN chat is anybun has either of those?? Let us know is anybun would like our contact details.

We will try and post on here but it won't be very often now, after all living outside means that we can't access the puwter as much!

Saffie says she sends lots of snuggles to Darcy and is hoping that he is ok???

I have my eye on a doe over the pond but am not sure if she is available but she is such a princess i can't stop thinking about her!

Casper says everyone seems to be in love around him and what is going on, he doesn't think anybun would be interested in him and is feeling sorry for himself.

Lots of snuggles

We hope everybun has had a good week, today the sun has been out all day but we didn't get to play out as none of us were feeling our normal selves, you see last night all of us haad to go and see the VET for our vaccinations, I had my VHD one and Casper and Saffie had their myxi ones. The vet was nice told us all of us were in good condition and our nails were nice and short and didn't need trimming which was great then he weighed us all, all weigh 3.50kg, Casper weighs 3.60kg and little saffie 2.25kg!

The needles were big but we were brave and let the vet put them in us after all it was for our own good, the only bad thing was i had to hhad 2 needles because i was having the VHD jab which i have had funny reactions to in the past so the VET now gives me some Rimadyl as well. Today i have a bit of runny nose and we are all quiet none of our breakfast has been eatern but mum said that we will all feel better in a day or 2.

Anyway it is important that we all keep our vaccinations up.

Lots of snuggles

We posted calendars to Merry, Taz and Dylan today or rather we got mum to! Thanks to jetty for his order which we will post out on Monday, as mum is going away next weekend for a week could anyone else who wants to place orders let us know that way she will get your calendars ready before she goes away so that they can be sent as soon as we get the pellet tokens that way hopefully you will all  get them before christmas and there will be no hold ups!

Anyway this evening mum comes back from work and offered us some treats but can you believe it they were woof woof biscuits ok they were plain ones but we were not impressed and showed her by turning our backs on her!

What a busy weekend we had playing out in the garden willoe and myself got to play out loose in the garden for a while which was great fun. Saffie got lots of cuddles from mum as she can't run loose in the garden as she gets scared and the meows might try and eat her.

We have good news hot of the printer tonight is the first journal calendar, thanks to all the models who sent photos there are some lovely ones in there. Here are a couple of photos of the calendars so you can all have an idea of what they look like.

Its not to late if anybun else wants to order a calendar either a personalised one or the journal one. We are sending mum out to get more ink tomorrow so she can print more.

Well its still windy here so mums left our covers down again today, lets hope its better tomorrow so they can be lifted up. We did go out in our run as it wasn't raining just windy. Penny the 2 foot who brings us treats at lunchtime said to mum she was worried about saffy as she is normally the  first one of us that greats her and grabs her treat but today she didn't appear for ages and Penny had to lift to covers to look for her and then finally she turned up for her treat, mum said that she would watch her as she was eating her treats very slowly yesterday and on Saturday and our breakfast hasn't all been eatern for the last few days. Willoe has got a dirty bottom but mum blames that on him eating too much and probably some of either mine or saffies share!

We have finally got our 12 models for the 2008 calendar so we will get it designed and printed this week then take some pictures of it for you all to see. Lots of you will know what they are like but we know we have a few new readers this year.

We have had a great time cause mums been off its meant that we could all have a explore around the garden, Saffie still isn't keen on being loose in the garden especially after one of the meows decided to tap her bottom! The meows don't get too close to me and Casper and we are so big we scare them a bit.

Casper didn't want to go out and play today it was just me getting to hop round the garden and explore whilst saffie stayed with mum and had lots of cuddles and casper stayed in our safe outside burrow. I had great fun playing with the meows and chasing them and then hiding in the plants from mum, the fallen leaves are the most fun they make a great noise, mum just wishes she knew if they were safe enough for us to have them put in out run to play with.

It was funny when mum cleaned us out today (we have her well trained she cleans our trays out everyday in the hutch, cause we were litter trained before we moved outside we carried on using big deep trays in our hutch that are filled with lots of wood shavings, straw and hay so are rather snug) one of the meows Roxy jumped in our hutch with us and then climbed into the tray I was in and snuggled down with me, then went for a walk down the ladder into the run and said hi to Casper and Saffie, mum was laughing at her, and said she is the only meow she trusts with us.

Oh mum has said that we had better eat properly tonight as we haven't eaten our breakfast for the past 2 days, we ate our tea last night but mum says just having tea is not enough we have to start having our breakfast as well!

Anyway here are some more photos of us, taken today, must go as we need our food and mums busy printing out the first bath of calendars.

We know that it has been a while since we posted on our journal which we do appologise about but since we have moved outside we can't get to the puwter as easily and secondly we are all being good bunnies and can't really get up to anything naughty well apart from the odd escape whilst being cleaned out.

Its strange being outside as it gets dark really quickly in the afternoons and there are no lights to turn on outside and no light up box to watch in the evenings, we have the other 2 foots that live in the same burrow as mum well trained and they bring us treats, one of the 2 foots is really nice and brings us treats when she comes home for her lunch so we get extra which is great!

Mum keeps hogging the puwter inside the burrow as she has had lots of studying to do, or so she says!

We have managed to get mum to start work on some more calendars for next year as she has had some orders from 2 foots that had them last year and others who saw the ones that she made and want some too. We have also had her making more keyrings and fridge magnets which keeps her nice and busy, if any one else wants some this year let us know. We are trying to decide if we should do another journal calendar where there are so many new bunnies around what does everyone think? Our email address is bunnies_den@yahoo.co.uk

Anyway had better go as mum is late with our breakfast so we need to throw all our toys to get her attention and remind her!

Lots of snuggles

We think summer may have finally arrived we just hope that it is here to stay for a while! For the past few days its been nice and hot, and our mum has turned a funny red colour on her arms which must mean that it is summer time! We are lucky compared to lots of bunnies as our burrow is in a nice shady corner of the garden where there are lots of big plants that shelter us from the sun and stop us getting too hot, we like the concrete that our run is on as its nice and cool to lie on. Mums not been putting us on the lawn for the last few days as she says we would be too hot there but we don't mind as our burrow is so big and lots of place for us to play in and hide.

Mum made us all have a brush today as we are moulting soooo much at the moment, saffie is the only one that isn't very much but then her coat is different to ours!

Anyway off for another snooze and then a bit of a play once it starts getting a bit cooler.

Snuggles to all

First of all congratulations to Inga on new arrivals!

We are sooo excited today, we got our first parcel since moving into our new burrow and it came from Maddie, we used mums plastic thing to get Maddie to send us some grass mats, (mum agrees its important that we have these as we can play with them and chew them so they stimulate us and stop us getting bored), we also got some pineapple and papaya which we tried willoe as usual wanted more than mum would let him have, and some apple peices which mums put over our salad tonight. But the best surprise was Maddie sent us a present as well it was a grassy ball which smells great and as soon as mum put it in our run Willoe and I set to work on it, it tastes good and makes a nice noise when you chew it! Mum has said that we can't have a grassy mat at the moment as we have to make things last.

The only bad thing about today was mum made me and willoe have a brush and combed us as well cause we our all moulting, Capser got out of it cause he hid at the back of the run where he knows mum can't reach us, but i heard mum saying she would get him tomorrow as hes turning a funny colour and not as white as he was.

Anyway off for another chew of the grassy ball.

Snuggles to all.

"event","Hi Guys

Sorry for not posting for soooo long but we ended up having to move burrows a lot sooner than we planned. Our old landlord told mum that he wanted her out and we had to go straight away so mum sent us to the cattery for a few days then the landlord told mum she had 24 hours to move out of the burrow but luckily she managed to move into the new burrow a lot sooner so after a few days at the cattery we joined mum in the new burrow on the day she moved in but we were in for a bit of a shock.

There we were thinking that we would carry on sharing the same room as mum and keeping her awake at night but oh no we ended up being put into something called a hutch in a garden something none of us had ever seen before so it was all a bit of a shock but we are ok and happy as we are all still together and still have mum to look after us plus some other 2 foots. Mum now lives with another doe 2 foot and her young kit who is 3 yrs old and then the other doe 2 foot's mum live in the basement downstairs, mum says her room is really suitable for us plus she is worried we may chew things and the garden is so much nicer. we aren't allowed loose in the garden because there are too many meows including 2 that live with the grandma 2 foot in the basement who have 7 kittens between them (mum says 2 kittens are going to then live upstairs with her and the other doe 2 foot) The grandma 2 foot is worried the meows might hurt us if we were loose or we may eat a plant that upsets us, also there are really big seagulls who may come and attack us, but we have a run that we get to go in that is covered on the grass which is fun.

Mum couldn't find a hutch which was big enough for all 3 of us so another 2 foot visited and built a tunnel which connects 2 hutches together so we have lots of room to play.

Heres a picture of our new burrow isn't it cool the way we have 2 interconnecting ones! Can you see Willoe in one hes in one side of the burrow and in the other hes in the other burrow?

And in this last picture you can see the litte tunnel that was built so we can go between the burrows, Casper is in the tunnel and saffie wanted to pose for the picture.

The grandma 2 foot called Penny brings us treats when she comes to see us which is great mum has trained her well and the little 2 foot kit helps mum feed us but mum doesn't let her pick us up as we don't like that, so we have decided lifes not too bad as outdoor buns when you are looked after well.

We are concerned that we may be cold in the winter and mum is trying to work out how to insulate our cage so we can still see out and still have litter trays to sleep in like we do at the moment so if anyone has any ideas of what we could put on the cage to keep us warm please let us know.

Snuggles to all.

Willoe, Casper and Saffie

Maddie please carry on getting better"

We're all back from the cattery now after we had to stay there whilst mum went back home for her Granddad's funeral. Mum had hoped that whilst we were at the cattery Saffy and myself might start to get on again but no such luck i ended up having a pen of my own and just went to visit willoe and saffy every day but saffy still scared me and i still run away from her which makes her chase me.

Willoe and i are still friends but cause he's also friends with saffy i don't get to spend all my time with him.

Mum found us all somewhere else to live last night so we are moving burrows at the end of July. We will be sharing a house with 2 other doe 2 foots and a kit 2 foot and 2 meows who are both having kittens soon. The lady mum will be sharing the top part of the burrow with has said that we can come indoors to mums room if we want but mum has decided cause there is such a nice garden she is going to have a hutch out there for us and then we will just come in for the evenings to watch tv with her, saying that cause i am not getting on with saffy mum has said that there is a chance that i will stay indoors all the time in mums room and just go outside for the odd time which would be nice.

Anyway thats our news must go now as mums ordering a hutch and i want to supervise.

Today mum had some very bad news, her grandad who had been around the sun 78 times died yesterday evening, luckily it was whilst he was at home in his burrow, but they had only found out on Thursday last week that he had kidney cancer so mum hadn't had chance to go back and see him as they expected him to be around for a while longer. Mum is upset and we are trying to cheer her up, mum's grandad was more like her dad to her as her dad wasn't around when she grew up. Mum is now waiting to find out when she can get a flight to go home and we have been told that we will have to be good and stay at the cattery if she can get us a space, she is just worried cause saffy and casper still don't get on so she is not sure what to do with casper, she has even thought about taking him home with her but doesn't think he will like the flight, maybe being at the cattery will make him and saffy get on?


Anyway we are off to make sure no matter how sad mum is she doesn't forget our breakfast today and even saffy has let her stroke her for a long time!

Its me again Saffy, today has been a busy day first of all we sent mum to get us more greens from the super market then we helped her clean up, she didn't seem to happy when she found that there was blood over the carpet but can't find any cuts on any of us so thinks that it may be from willoes paw, now she is trying to get it out of the carpet with not much luck! 

Then this afternoon mum took me and casper into the kitchen and put us in a pen together, we didn't like this and casper kept thumping and grunting and looking worried so mum came and sat in the pen with us so we both had a bonding session with mum, it wasn't fair cause each time i tried to get some of caspers fur mum stopped me and stopped me from chasing him, the only fun bit was being able to climb all over mum which we both did.

Willoe has spent the day letting mum stroke him cause she is upset cause she had some bad news on thursday from her mum as someone in her family is very sick at the moment and it looks like mum will need to fly home, we are just not sure when.

Anyway off for a sleep before dinner, i hope willoe leaves me some salad tonight, oh nearly forgot mum noticed his bottom is dirty again and has given him till tomorrow to clean it before she gives him another bath, haha!

Well willoes tummy seems to be a bit better and mum is letting him have some greens again to see how he gets on but hes such a pig, i like to sleep most of the evening so that i am able to be wide awake at 4.30am in order to wake mum up, cause i sleep late in the evening it means by the time i wake up most of the salad has been eaten by willoe and he just leaves me the odd bit he doesn't want how unfair is that?

Anyway mum is getting home later to the burrow now that she has started a new job but we are hoping that if she if she spends more time away from us she may feel guilty and buy us more treats and it seems to be working cause tonight mum brought us home a naturals carrot woodroll, its wood stuff full of dried carrot stuff and yummy, mum got one for me and willoe and one for casper how come he gets one to himself thats what i want to know!

Anyway its a bit early for me to be awake so i'm off for another nap.

I am really not happy today, mum picked me up to see if i was still clean and sore that i had lots of runny poos over my bottom so made me have a bath again, but then it went wrong as i was getting out of the sink mum noticed that my right heal was bleeding lots, you should have seen her fuss she made me sit still whilst she held a towel to it and then wouldn't let me hop back to the lounge she carried me and put me in caspers cage with him, mum says that she doesn't want me hopping about too much till my foot has stopped bleeding. Mum thinks i may have hurt it yesterday when i kept thumping my feet after my bath then so now i am on vet bedding.

Mums given me some dried rasberry leaves to help my tummy and tried to give me some probiotic but i spat it back at her that was funny, mum says i am not to have any veggies tonight to see if that helps but i love my veg surely there is something i can have? At least i am still eating loads at the moment but mum seems to think that could be what the problem is.

Anyway i am with casper at the moment looking very sad and damp as i won't let mum use the hair dryer on me.

Maybe nurse maddie will have some advise for me?

Its not fair mum has caused me to be all wet today cause she made me have a bath, she claims that she could smell me cause i have an upset tummy and its making my bottom dirty, its not my fault if runny poo then sticks to my fur. Mum said that she could have done without giving me a bath today as the smell was making her feel sick, more like the funny stuff she drank after work last night was!

Anyway now cause i wouldn't let mum dry me properly i am wet and i don't like it and keep thumping my feet, mum says she needs to wash the carpet as well cause i have made that messy from my tummy as well but at least that will keep her in the burrow tonight!

Sorry we didn't post anything last week we were just too busy as our grandma came to stay with us which was great cause we got lots of extra fusses me especially cause i have always been grandmas favourite bunny out of me and willoe and even saffy didn't manage to take my place! Its the first time grandma has seen saffy as mum kept her a secret from her till she came to stay, she made saffy have a cuddle which she wasn't happy about and each time saffy tried to have a go at me grandma told her off.

Saffy is still chasing me and i thump my feet each time she comes into my cage, mum says i have to have my cage open when shes at home so that willoe and saffy can visit me so that i get used to them again, i don't mind willoe visiting me now and i even let him fall asleep next to me which is better than i was a few weeks ago when i wouldn't let him near me. I still don't like saffy visiting me as she chases me sometimes and i don't like that especially if she tries to grab some of my fur. I've came out of my cage on my own yesterday for just a couple of seconds but mum says thats really good and both she and grandma agree with time we should be one big happy family again.

Whilst grandma was here she took some pictures of us all with mum as mum didn't have any of us with her. Mum took us all outside where we haven't been before and told us to sit together, it was such fun me and willoe kept hopping off but saffy couldn't cause she was put in a pot with plants in. When mum held saffy for some pictures with just her in it she bit mum which wasn't very nice, i just snuggled into mum when it was my turn as i love hugs with mum.

Anyway here are a few pictures that were taken.

This is all of us together with mum, can you see Saffy in the flower pot? I think she should stay in there and behave!

As you all know since Casper came back from the vets hes not been getting on with Saffy and seems quite scared of her and won't come out of his cage which mums had to keep him in so hes felt safe. Well today mum said that she had given Casper enough time to get better and it was about time he started being a bunny again and mixing with me and Saffy again. 

Mum got out the cage that she used when Casper first arrived in the burrow and then saffy and put just some vet bedding in it and a litter tray then put Casper and Saffy in it, i kept hopping round the edge of the cage and winding the others up cause i was loose and they weren't so mum picked me up and shut me in Caspers cage to keep me out of the way how un fair was that, i was only trying to supervise the others!

Anyway Casper and Saffy spent about 45 minutes together in the cage and Casper thumped his feet a lot but mum seemed pleased cause there wasn't much chasing going on and no fur was lost, they even sat in the litter tray together although casper didn't seem happy about this and thumped his feet. Now casper has gone back to his cage even though he can get out and saffy is hopping round the room.

Mum says that she is going to put them together again later and may even try it over night, (hope that doesn't mean i have to stay in Caspers cage again! she says casper just needs to get used to saffy again and if he stopping thumping his feet at her saffy would stop chasing him and hopefully we can all become friends again!

Hope everybun is having a good weekend so far. Mum was telling us that she is going to have a look at another burrow tomorrow cause our landlord has asked her if she is sure that there is only willoe living here (he didn't know about us) and he only wants one bunny living here so mum is going to look at at another burrow for us all to live in. The bad thing about the new burrow is that mum would have to share with some other 2 foots but she says that she can cope with that as they would be company and we would have to live outside, we are not sure if we would like to live outside or not but aparently there is a patio that we could live on. There is also a meow that lives in the burrow but thats ok we would just chase that!

Mum has said that she may have to try and persuade the other 2 foots to let her keep Casper in her room with her as he is still not happy and spends all of his day in his cage mainly sitting in his cosy litter tray even though mum leaves the cage door open for him when she is home he just doesn't want to come out and when mum makes him come out to say hi he thumps his feet and gets all scared which makes saffy chase him. Uncle hugh the vet thinks caspers behaviour is very odd and thinks it may be that he has just got too used to humans for company when he stayed at the vet cause they kept having to do things with him and now hes scared of other bunnies!
Mum wants casper to like us again so that we can all be friends but at the moment he just isn't trying which makes me sad!

Mums been busy looking at hutches for us incase we do go to live at the other burrow and she said how small rabbit hutches seem to be she wants a nice big one which will give us lots of exercise but none of the pet shops in Jersey have anything big enough so she has been looking on the internet.

Anyway i am off to remind mum it is saturday and thats fresh veg day so i need to send her off to the super-market to get us some!

Guess what i chased casper yesterday morning when mum got him out of his cage and managed to get some more of his lovely white fur but willoe saw me and then before i knew what was happening he was fighting with me and mum had to stop us, she hasn't separated me and willoe cause she says the last thing she needs is for us two to fall out as well and i've learnt now that unlike casper willoe fights back so its not a good idea to fight with him i'm better to hop off out of his way if he chases me.

As for casper i had another go at chasing him last night when mum was getting our dinner ready and i managed to get his ear a bit so that some red stuff came out, mum wasn't happy about that.

When mum not about she puts casper in a cage so that he isn't pestered by me but when shes home she lets him out but most of the time he stays in his cage or hops into the kitchen when he thinks i can't see him, (i normally try and chase him if i see him about) willoe trys to says hi when casper is out but casper just ignores him. Mums says shes not giving up on us after all we have been bonded before, she thinks it would help if casper would tell me off when i chase him and pull his fur to teach me a lesson but he doesn't he just hides.

Anyway of to see what mums doing and see where casper is. Mums got something called a head-ache at the moment which makes her feel sick shes had it for a few days and it just won't go away so maybe i can chase it away for her!

I don't mean to be nasty but i'm sooo confused one minute casper disappers for several days and just when i got used to him not being here he came back again. Mum wants me to stop being nasty as she says casper is still not himself and keeps trying to hide from me and isn't even that interested in his best mate willoe.

yesterday casper ate quite well which mum was really pleased about but tonight he has decided he doesn't want to eat again and is quiet again so mums giving him lots of fuss, we think he missed mum today cause she had to work so he didn't get as many snuggles from her as he did over the weekend.

(we think he's forgotton we are his friends, hes worse with saffy than with me but he still won;t even let me that close and i'm meant to be his best friend!

Casper is still not eating or drinking enough on his own and his poohs are still not big enough yesterday all casper ate was one grape, a sprig of basil, a celery leaf and a slice of carrot which mum says is no way near enough for a bunny of his size, mum tried to give him some critical care today to boost him up but he just spat it back at her and he won't take his pain killers either this morning. he definately isn't himself he is spending most of his time sitting in his litter tray.

Thanks to everybun that has been sending healing vibes to Casper. Uncle Hugh decided that even though he is still not well and eating enough on his own Casper should come home tonight to see how he gets on and in the hope that seeing his home will cheer him up and get him eating properly again and get the nasty thing in his stomach moving out. He has been poohing all the time hes been sick but his poohs uncle hugh says are not big enough and today at the vets they were all really runny so runny he made a mess of himself and the nurses had to give him a bath!

He came of his drip today and isn;t having any more drugs to make his tummy work faster cause uncle hugh wants to see how he gets on, he is still on painkillers which mum will have to give him twice a day. When uncle hugh examined casper today he said that he was still in pain round his tummy and intestines, he is just hoping that what is in his tummy is moving and it keeps moving cause if it stops it will be bad news for casper and he will have to more operations. Uncle Hugh wants mum to carry on with giving casper critical care for when hes not eating enough which should be fun to watch!

Since Casper came home tonight we have all had a fight which mum was not happy about she says we must all be nice to each other and let casper rest, mum says she will have to put casper on his own if we don't start to get on again.


Anyway off to hide from mum as i know i am in trouble for making casper want to fight me.

Caspers had lots of tests done today to see whats wrong with him, hes had blood tests, urine tests and an xray so is feeling a bit sleepy now from the anesthetic. Uncle Hugh says that he saw something in Caspers stomach which shouldn't be there and it could be a lump of hair or maybe some of the sofa we ate. He says thats probably why caspers not eating properly cause he feels full cause of whats in his tummy. Uncle Hugh wants to give Casper 48 hours to see if whats in his tummy starts to move out on its own and has put him on a drip for 24hrs to try and speed things along and also is still syringe feeding him critical care to make sure he gets some food. If Casper is still not eating properly in 48 hours he will probably have another xray to see if whats in his stomach has moved at all and if not he may have to be operated on to remove it, but uncle hugh said this would be dangerous so doesn't really want to have to operate.

Mums going to go and see casper tonight as he can't come home yet especially as he has a drip in him, we think he will pull that out!

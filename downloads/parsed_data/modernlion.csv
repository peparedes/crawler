32B SOUTH 1ST BROOKLYNS

My middle finger ROCKS FOREVER!
32B South 1st (between Kent Ave & Wythe Ave, closer to Kent) in Williamsburg Brooklyns in Yankee State.

I HEART YOU APPLE LIU
If you're poor take the ""L"" train to ""Bedford Ave/North 7th"" and venture to the ultimate party in Williamsburg. HUZZAH. Walk on Bedford Ave against traffic until you get to South 1st (about 8 blocks), take a right down South 1st (about 3 blocks) almost to Kent Ave.

If you're going to buy beer/wine/zima there's a place on Grand St (block before South 1st) & Beford Ave with cheap shit. Need help? 917 304 9266"

i miss sheryl and her crazy haircuts.
and by hair cuts i mean the haircuts that
were on my head  when drinks  where had 
at our old salt lake apartment on highland drive.
no hair cuts were did this past week.
but oh, did we drink to remember
the oven dance that sheryl
does... but everyone
thinks i just do.

i was a little drinker.

& p.s.
i had a fit and got some jersey trash kicked out of quo
for drinkin out of our vip kettle one at quo.
& p.s.s.
jersey prince and princess where served the bird

which is good.

in a bad bad way.

revisited old harvey songs.
little fish?
pj was wearing a jesus dress.
rhinestones and religion is key.

i talked to someone i don't know today
and confessed i have a
motivation problem.
who knows.
well i suppose,
for one. the person
i don't know, knows it.

i have a job.
www.fredflare.com
i do things.
i like it.
and i love going to brooklyn every morning.
walking down bedford reminds me of a hipster
version of church street in burlington.

but then again. do i miss that?
i suppose i do.

ali came and visit.
i miss her.
and love her.
her apt, so she says, is smaller then
josh and my old apt in the east village.
is that possible?

jared is flying in tonight.
he wants to sell his canopus drums.
any buyers?
then he's off the alabama to continue touring with
42nd street in all its road show glory.

i found the lost post card to betsey and shioban in chicago.
stamped and ready to go today. a month later.
i think it is possibly more tasteful that way.
everytime i think of chicago i am happy.
and everytime i think of cheekagwa i think of jaime.
which then makes me think about chicago.
and how its a native american name.
and then i think of jaime and chicago at the same time.
its crazy.
like the law.

i'm going to learn silkscreening.
and then all of you will wear
my t shirts.
because they will be covered in religion and rhinestones.
its key.
but seriously.
i have plans.

and woot woot for sheryl coming to new york
october 20th.
its going to be like super fun lucky times but with 
religion and rhinestones galore.
GALORE.

i am a robot
?

slash planet.

disposing the unresourceful.

or a lie.

"event","this is my film script written by charles.

my apartment.
me, laying on bed using laptop

music:""Got To Give It Up"" by Marvin Gaye

the door is being opened
zoom to door
whitney houston enters

me, looks up from laptop
after long pause of slow motion eyelid movement cutting back and forth between whitney houston and me

me ; ""welcome to crack house on crackanue B""

whitney played by craig david (englands r&b sensation) ; ""thanks for the welcoming, but i wont be here long enough to need one!""

sound effects of ninja throwing stars repeating as i glace in slow-mo and then fast instant replay.

me, turns quickly and glances at body gaurds david and victoria beckham to sic whitney

whitney played by r&b u.k. sensation craig david, struggles against the beckhams tight hold
whitney ; ""curse you eff in the aye, i will freebase off of your childrens childrens spoons! you just wait and see, i'm whitney houston, i'm a diva and divas live forever""
whitney snatches a hidden molten hot crackpipe from her panties and throws it at the left side of my neck.

me, attempt to dogde the sizzling crack pipe but turn to the left instead of the right
the skin melting crackpipe burns crack into my skin as i feel myself getting high.
me, realises its a farse and yell ""this isn't a wack crack pipe bitch! YOU'RE a wack crack pipe bitch!""

me, pulls sunglasses from behind head onto my face
leaps out of bed in laying position and floats around the room
me ""this doesnt mean you're on crack whitney, this means i can fly around in laying position...""
camera zoon to my head, dubbed voice-over (no mouth movement) ""...and speak to you in your head""

whitney houston uses her uncanny ability to smoke david and victoria through her half diva half cyborg crackpipe self
whitney ""the only voices that mess with MY head are bobbie brown and the devil himself, well i mean, speaking through the voice of james earl jones!""




i think i just started to create something that was making me less intellegent if that is possible.
all i have to say in a case like this is, T G I F ! and that's all i have to say in a case like this.

and i need a day off."

bad timing for everything
is essential
to make things just that much
more regretable.

josh stayed in the hospital the entire time
it was his day off work.
gayona rubbed my back, she cried the morning
we called 911.
mel reminded me i wasn't dead and cousins
need to be more reachable.

new york hospital rooms are small
with not enough room
for seats
or guests to sit on them."

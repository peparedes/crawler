"event","Well, I have tonssss of math homework to do still--three and a half more pages. Unfortunately myspace definitely doesn't help with NOT distracting me. Plus this journal entry. Plus Twighlight, which I'm dying to read. Then the TV is on too, and Dad is helping Norine with her homework.

Yes, that WAS a ""code name"" I guess you could say. I'm not going to use very many actual names in case someone that knows me comes across this. I've decided.

And I've decided I want to try to update this everyday. I've realized that I hardly remember anything, unless they impact me in a negative way. These are my high school years. I want to keep them to memory. I want to relish in the good times. 

I've never been good at keeping a diary. I was always too lazy. 
But this should be easier. It's just typing after all. I just hope the site doesn't crash or anything. 

I reeeallyyyy hope I do well on my math test tomorrow :(. So I better go study and finish my homework so I actually have SOMETHING to be credited for. Then there's that presentation in dance tomorrow :(. I tried getting a hold of Therese and Cairie. And either I did and they were messing with me, or I just couldn't. Their fault I guess. It's just a 2 minute presentation that we WOULD have completed were it not for Therese being a complete douche bag. 

I do have some things on my mind. Quite a bit actually. Concerning Diane and Chris of course. But I REALLY gotta get my homework done. And hopefully whatever I have on my mind doesn't affect how I am with him. I want to be happy with him. I want to make him happy. 

It seems like I always have something on my mind. And interestingly enough, why does it always have to be something negative?

Really."

"event","Hm. So this is my first entry! But it's going to be extremely short because it's a Wednesday morning, and I don't have a lot of time. I still have to get in the shower, throw some clothes on, and get my hair and make up ready. It pretty much sucks, because I need another 2 hours of sleep, maybe 3. Then I have to spend the rest of the day writing up my global assignment so I can type it up at lunch. Yep, I was being pretty horrible yesterday. I basically didn't get anything I wanted to get done, done. God, I want a nap. I'm taking a Monster to school."

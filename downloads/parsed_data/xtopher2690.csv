Today was my grandpas birthday! after the communion i went to his house for dinner and cake so that was fun too!!! then i came home and talked with Dara for like a half hour down by the fire house about certain disgusting things... me n Dara are on the same bus for six flags as long as im not on bus 1 i dont care!! im sure perverted things will be going on there!!! in fact i am positive... dun wanna se ethat now do we... ugh i have a lot of opinions on that subject none i can say though.. i can say that what i want to say is not very nice! people are gross... we r like 13 yrs old we dun need to be doing all this crap in school lets face it we rnt even close to mature enough except a select few who r but im not and not many people are... i mean honestly ive never even kissed a girl i dont care how dorky it is i just i dont know i have a desire to but i dont know if i am ready or not i cant be sure until it hapeens i guess its a feeling you get i just dont want to end up being all over somebody in the hallway having people call me a hoe or whoever im&nbsp; slobbering on aa hoe and besides i wouldnt do that in front of somebody it is sorta supposed to be something special not just something that is casual!</P>
<P>Kenny is a jerk i really dont like that boy he is like the devil i commented something on Alex site saying how cool it as and then he starts being a jerk to me n samm oo wweeellll</P>

<P>SHMS middle south walking down the hallway and there on the floor are those dam people who are for PDA so if you can understand me saying this dont be mad just kind of tone it down just a little bit maybe like the eenciest bit or maybe even the size of the universe good god you even get on your own damb friends nerves</P>"

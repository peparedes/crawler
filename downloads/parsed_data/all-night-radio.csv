"event","I was talking to my old&nbsp;best friend from Toronto; I miss&nbsp;him.I've grown apart from all my friends there; and to be quite honest it makes me upset. Funny enough; that just&nbsp;set in; <em>that we've grown apart. </em>I don't know; I really don't know anymore. Are certain friendships meant to end? Or do they just end because of silly circumstances like distance?&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />I really don't know anymore; about anything. I really want to get close with them again; and patch up the rifts but will it be possible? Only time can really tell I suppose. No one ever told me that life would ever be this unfair. That I'd loose great friends, or find a love that lives half way across the planet. Maybe there just tests from God or the greater being thats out there, to see if I'll work hard for what I want.<br /><br /><br /><br />Well I want this, and I want her;<br />so here it goes."

"event","School officially sucks. <br />But that was pretty obvious from the start.<br /><br />I really need to catch up on my reading;when I say that I mean DECENT BOOKS.<br />That have good plots and characters. I also need some NEW music because I am infinitely bored with my selection. I should start listening to '77 punk and riot grrrrrrl again. <br /><br />I'm going to have to start applying for Universities soon. Top 3 choices are;<br /><br />A) Mac Master University<br />B) University of Toronto (ERINDALE CAMPUS)<br />C) York University<br /><br />Should I apply to the Royal Military College? Maybe; I'm not sure about that yet though. I really should start doing my homework. Ah. I feel lonely; my mom is sick and sleeping whilst I am alone in my basement. Someone come visit me now!!!<br /><br />If you know of any good books; list them PLEASE!<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />PS.<br />Thanks dAno for finally giving me the Naruto link. I actually like it; except for Sakura. I'm glad your writing a Fan Fiction about her dying; maybe I can make a guest appearance where I punch her in the stomach and make her eat her own eyeballs. I think that would officially make you're story the best!<br /><br /><br />Apparently I have -no freaking idea how to do an LJ cut so I will wait for dAno's instruction. <br /><br /><font size=""4""><b>Funny moment.<br /></b></font><br />My mother and I were watching TV the scary <b>Burger King Man</b> came on. I said that I was extremely frightened of him and would be deathly scared if he showed up in my room one night. My mother proceeds to say; <br /><br /><i>""Don't worry dear; I'd come in you're room and smack him up and say stop bugging my Zainabeeee""<br /><br /></i>She is so funny when she isn't grumpy"

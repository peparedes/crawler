All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world ... world
Enlarge your world

"event","Wow talk about being completely uncomfortable. I am actually scared to try and go to bed!!! I mean I am going to melt away I know it! Then no one will be able to find me!!! OH NO!!!

Lets see after my last entry I ate a really yummy Terriyaki Burger with pinnapples on it and swiss cheese with some cranberry juice. And then my sister and I ran around the backyard chasing my dog with the hose. He loves it when we play with water. And then I hung out and fumbled around my room getting way to hot to clean hard core like I usually do. Got pooped, took a nice COLD shower then did some artwork. Made a CD, anddid not do my exercising like I planned.

I am very bad at doing what I need to do when it comes to stuff at home unless someone is yelling at me to get my butt up and do it now.

And since I have been sitting here trying to type I keep getting attacked by this enormous mosquito!!!!! Damn him! Or her. I feel all kinds of lovely bites on me now. This sucks. 

AND I was trying to get my cat inside and this huge bat flew over my friggin head scaring the pis out of me(not really I can hold it).

And now I am going to go take another shower then go to bed. Or try to at least......."

"event","Yummy, it is so hot out I dont dare eat something cooked. I have never had a Diet Coke taste so good and so cold and crisp. I have to remind myself to slow down when the pop starts to come out my nose.


    Well so far today has gone well I still have to go clean my room though so I think I might wait till tonight when it cools off. I need to go buy some more Vitamin Water and freeze them so I have some refreshing slushies. Yum I say.

    And soon I am going to jump into a nice cold shower to cool me off, and then go try and kill my chub tummy by doing some friggin crunches/sit-ups....who knows maybe even try to get some jogging in if my legs can handle it. And what I mean by that is I went on a bike ride the other day with my Very Great Friend Ashley, and I told her its been awhile since I last rode a bike(not that long but long enough). But she took me on this hardcore trail with all kinds of crazy hills and pot holes and cut offs where youre going straight then all of a sudden you have to turn right. I almost flew into the bushes if i wouldnt have stopped. And I got taken out by a sticker bush. I kinda wish I tore up that trail even if it ripped me apart. I have this urge now to take on the trail even if I end up flying over the handle bars. Makes me laugh though.  

    I have the best sense of humor I am told, I love stupid thing like when tom green does stuff it usually makes me laugh hard, or will farrel can crack me up any day. I love Dave Chapell(not sure if thats spelled right). I watch comedy central so much I could consider it a religion, or like the importance of water. I mean they are some real  messed up people on there sometimes but usually I cant stop laughing. I love Reno 911. That makes me fall to the floor laughing.

 Well I will add more later. Im a talker/typer......uh whatever. I will talk about one thing and I guarantee you that 10 minutes later i will be on the 10th new subject. But some how they all run together. And I actually remember how once I ended up talking about something that had NOTHING to do with what I started talking about."

"event","My first entry and I have nothing to talk about right now. Thats ok though, because Im sure by tonight I will have something to talk about. For now though I am going to go get some work done on this friggin hot day where the house is an actual oven. Im literally baking! This is crazy! I want to go jump into a cold shower and lay there for an hour and hopefully that will keep me cool for about 10 minutes after the shower is done. You know now that I think about it, I take about 3 to 4 showers a day because I get all hot and sticky. Feels nice though!!"

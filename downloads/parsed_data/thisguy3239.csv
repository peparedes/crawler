For some reason, it took me a really long time to put this is order. Its kind of what I expected, I my grand design. My fingers are full of tension, fumbling with the composition that tries to explain how I live. I guess, when things eventually balance out, its not so bad, it will be a light life. A life full of harmony, musical and cosmic, something around the area of careful, exact, peace."

"event","Often I relate to characters in novels, fiction more so than others. I don't think this is just me, but something that is a human trait. It's always fun when you figure out that a character is more like you that you had noticed before.

Not always good, but closer to right. Philocetes was one example of that. For rot not only is symbolic, but smells bad too.

A witness to things that fall. Walls and people alike.

One who would wait and charge, build only to destroy. Some of accomplished the goal by means as wild as a horse.

Now, I know how it all ends, the man leaves, returns home after a many long year, many many. Home isn't what it seemed.

This much I know, that the path is longer that I believe. But what is reality? This character doesn't work for me completely, because I don't know if his home is symbolic enough to mine. I can't tell if I am going to end up back where I started or settle somewhere new, like Mr. Smith. Well, some place that is new in my mind. (Hahaha, native american joke!)

The goal is now, some place new.

How do these things begin? Did it start with that underwater kiss that never happened?
Was it the afternoon mudslides?
What was the moment when this turn of events happened, that I would never think to look for?
What atom of my life changed and shifted the destination of my graduate work?
Kiesgen knew nothing about anything... well, involving the atoms of my fate. He just looks out for my best career choices.
McDonald wants me in his studio.
I go where they coach me to go.
If everything works out the way my teachers want it to... I'm heading to New England.

He asked me to take a shot with him, over the phone, to celebrate the successful move into this my apartment. So I did. Then we took another one to his extra bed room and bath that he got with hopes of having me come out there and stay with him. So we did. He and I talked about the opera ""Aida"", he had just seen it on a tour, and we laughed about things and better times. When I got off the phone I got really pissed. My dad is lonely. The man is 62, and living in North Carolina all by himself, dealing with loneliness. What the fuck. The man has put in his time to this world, paid his due, the least he could be given in his life is some security and happyness with his wife. Loneliness! I am supposed to be the lonely one!

There I was, on a snow covered tennis court with no foot prints around other than the path I traveled, laughing out loud.

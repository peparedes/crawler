"event","I went to Austin this past weekend for a volleyball tournament... well my team didnt do so good but I had a lot of fun.

Friday Night- Some of us walked to Wendy's which we had to go down 6th street and it was extra crowded! Went to bed at like 3am had to wake up at 7:30 the next morning. AWESOME!
Saturday Night- This was the best night of all... I went somewhere....hehehe....Lets just say....UT Frat FOAM parties are fun! Taxi Cabs are fun too! When we got back to the Hotel::cough::3:45am::cough:: We called the front desk guy for a wake up call and then he sounded bored so Tacy talked to him on the phone for like an hour and then she was like lets go down there he sounds hott so we went but he wasnt!
Sunday Night- Ordered pizza and then me and Tracy where waiting for it outside and the Valet guys were so hitting on us and one of them wanted my number but I was like sorry Im takin and then he was like yea well we can just be friends... eh... he was kinda cute....then after pizza me Tracy and Cat went to Wendy's bc everyone wanted frosty's and we were the only ones that would go, but I was still in my volleyball stuff you know the short tight spandex... and we had to walk down 6th street and there was this one car with a lot of black guys in it and one stuck his head out and yelled ""DAMN... WHITE GIRL GOT BOOTY!"" I mean really what a loser! There were others that tried to get our attention like w=one screamed ""Hey Volleyball"" But I didnt answer! Then we got back to the hotle and did some weird stuff int he breakfast room...Leg wresteling, Human knot, Human Sqaure, Human Circle....ect. Then we went to ""bed"" actually we watched White Noise till ike 4am and Had to wake up at 9am! Awesome!


Well that was my weekend!!!


I love him!!!!!"

Lets see this week... I broke one of my best friends teeth and SOME people blew it out of proportion and really got on my nerves! There are so many little girls at my school that talk so much shit... its annoying! Crazy people... Then some one told someone that I wanted to fight this girl and that was never true either... Some people believe everything! 

T G I F

Today me and Cat went swimming in my pool... It was a bit nippy.... and then we watched Closer which was an ok movie we didnt get it so we had to go back and analaysis it..... I mean we are a little blonde!!

If your wondering about my guy situation::: Well Lets just say right now I am keeping my options open...!

I have a basetball tournament this weekend... awesome!"

"event","My life has turned into one big practice...thats all I ever do! Like yesterday I had to run 8 150's and an 800 and then right after that I had to go to basketball practice on the other side of town for 2 hours. And then today I had track but we didnt do much and at 7 30 I have to go to volleyball practice for 2 hours! That is all types of crazy! 
          


                ~ANYWAYS~



Today my day was good bc I got to wear a really cute outfit and I talked to a really cute guy today....eeeekkkk! I dunno it has just been good. I got a new swimsuit to its balck and it has pink and white polka dots and duh its a bikini... I also got saturday a green brown blue and white bikini too... its cute! Spring break is in ONE WEEK!!! HoW ExCiTiNg!!!!!!!! 

Things that made me mad today....

My coach told me that I need to loose some inches in my BUTT HIPS and THIGHS! First of all its not my fault I have a big butt for a white girl..and my hips are not that big, I mean really look at me..but I am 7 pounds under weight and that is fine with me...This is exactly why teen girls go all diet crazy and get bad health and stuff... I mean Im not the type to do that bc I know better but still its people like her that make this stuff happen!

Well yea I have to be like a banana and split.... gotta get ready for practice! Whoopie!

Help me figure this band out, they were one hit wonders around 2003?
All I recall is their music video was shot in the woods and involved a creepy girl and a bathtub of worms, the singer had short blonde hair and the band was a one word named band, they sounded somewhat similar to korn and I believe they came out around 2003/2004, as stated before I think this video/song was their only hit. This is driving me nuts. Thanks."

Dare to kiss?

Question is, who
REALLY has the guts to reply, no matter who gets
this:

If you would like to secretly kiss the person
who posted this bulletin, reply to them with the
msg ""i would like to kiss u."" or ""mwah"" (or whatever you want to say)

If not, just re-post your own bulletin to see who
secretly wants to kiss you ...

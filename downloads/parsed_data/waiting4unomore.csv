"event","<p>I haven't wrote in here in a really long time. i don't even know where to start. so much has happened in the past like 5 months i dont think it would even fit on here. well i moved out and moved in with one of my friends and her mom then one of our best firends moved in with us everything was going really well until he moved. he wanted nothing to do with her but we were fine. it was like nothing happened between us. but that started a lot fighting between me and the friend i was living with. we were at the point of fighting each other. but they ended up making up and he moved back in then some things happened again and he moved back out. again things were fine between us but it brought alot of tension between the one i was living with but this time we had his ex telling me one thing and then her and her mom the total oppsite. well he happened to get mad at me for only god knows what and we stoped talking so everything settled down. well until thanksgiving anyway. on thanksgiving night me and christina (his ex) got kicked out because we had left with her then boyfriend and didn't invite her. so we went and stayed with her then boyfriend for a couple of days then he came in the picture. and we ended up all going to a motel room and got drunk for 2 nights in a row. the next day she dropped me off at work and I didn't hear from her for like 2 weeks. that was great cause she had all my stuff except what i had left at my moms. I ended up moving back in with my mom and then a couple weeks later having to quit my job because it conflicted with there work schdueles. now because of her me and him are fighting again because come to find out she was with him and his boy and they still think that i knew all about. but i guess thats ok in away i'm kinda better off with out them. i deffently don't have as much drama in my life now so i feel a lot better about that.&nbsp;if your still reading this sorry its soo long but as you can see a lot has happened to me in the past few months. lol</p>"

then yesterday we went out and we ran because brittany has to get use to running for tennis which starts monday! i feel bad for her because her summer is like over then! but then we came in and we were going to go watch the football team practice but she didn't feel like so that didn't work. but its all good. then later we played spades with her mom. mom like totally won but i came in second and poor brittany came in last! hah that was funny. we barely made it to 2:00 am last night.


then today we woke up about 2:00pm and brittany went out and ran again and i played tennis with the wall! oh that was fun!! it was like so hott outside!! but we made it though!! lol. so now we're just sitting around here. i have to go home soon so thats about it for the last few days."

"event","I need to go do something. I hate sitting in this house all the time but theres nothing to do because oc course everyone else is still in school. Thats the only sucky part of being out of school early. I want to go somewhere and do something besides sitting here! ugh!!!!! We finally got our new computer the other day. Its about time too. we needed one really bad. The only problem now is I have to figure out everything and then tell my mom and dad. fun stuff if you know what i mean. lol. I'm so tired. I have no idea why either, its like i have to get up early or anything. i just don't know anymore. I give up trying to figure things out. its to tiring"

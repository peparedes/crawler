YOUR ITINERARY: Upper Egypt, 1907. A perilous adventure into antiquity with fiction's most beloved archaeologist and her captivating cohorts.

WITNESS exotic scenery, craven tomb robbers, vengeful gods!

DISCOVER stolen treasures, a mysterious cult, surprising secrets hidden in desert sands!

FIND THE UNEXPECTED a ruthless, remorseless killer with his eye on Amelia!
      
I am reading 'The ape who guards the balance' for probably the fifth time. I do love it though. I almost feel as if I personally know the rather dysfunctional and psychotic darlings. I have to finally agree with Cat, Ramses is wonderful! I still like David better though...In some ways. Well at least I think I would like David better if he existed. Ramses is too egotistical. Besides I feel certain that David looks like the escalator guy..:)
Before I retire to read the above book and eat strawberry yogurt chocolate, I must include some quotes.
""Alisha if I'm a slacker then you are a...a...um...slacktress! Yes! Hah!""
                               Nat
""There are lots of French people in France""
               Mom
I know there must be more...My dear family and friends are always saying hysterical things. I just cannot think of any more. I am very sorry. Farewell!"

"event","I have recently fallen in love with Langston Hughes. Here are some of my favorite poems by him. 

As I Grew Older
 
It was a long time ago.
I have almost forgotten my dream.
But it was there then,
In front of me,
Bright like a sun--
My dream.
And then the wall rose,
Rose slowly,
Slowly,
Between me and my dream.
Rose until it touched the sky--
The wall.
Shadow.
I am black.
I lie down in the shadow.
No longer the light of my dream before me,
Above me.
Only the thick wall.
Only the shadow.
My hands!
My dark hands!
Break through the wall!
Find my dream!
Help me to shatter this darkness,
To smash this night,
To break this shadow
Into a thousand lights of sun,
Into a thousand whirling dreams
Of sun! 


 
Oppression
		 
Now dreams
Are not available
To the dreamers,
Nor songs
To the singers.

In some lands
Dark night
And cold steel
Prevail
But the dream
Will come back,
And the song
Break
Its jail. 

Quiet Girl
		 
I would liken you
To a night without stars
Were it not for your eyes.
I would liken you
To a sleep without dreams
Were it not for your songs	 
  
Suicide's Note

The calm, 
Cool face of the river
Asked me for a kiss. 
	 
  
Walkers with the Dawn
		 
Being walkers with the dawn and morning,
Walkers with the sun and morning,
We are not afraid of night,
Nor days of gloom,
Nor darkness--
Being walkers with the sun and morning."

"event","This is, in case you did not read the title, for Bethany. She told me to update my journal, and so I will. Sometimes I loathe how passive I am...I miss Cat almost as much as I would miss myself, if I were somehow to fly away and leave a hollow, happy, brave Alisha behind. Lavender soap from botanicus floats! Is that not fabulous? It would be wonderful even if it sunk to the bottom of the tub, forcing you to search beneath bubbles for it, but it floats!
All of my books for english came yesterday and I am very exited about them. I have already read some of them though and am trying to convince mother that I do not need to read a book I read when I was eleven, all over again... I have written heaps of poems lately and I need to give them to Emma, but I have not corrected them yet. I think she might faint if I gave them to her as they are now. I found some eccentric boots at tango and mom says I may have them because my loafers are dying. Emily, Aimee, Hannah Wood and Hannah Yurkovich are all coming over this weekend! It will be fun but kind of hectic. Every time Nat comes upstairs slowly I think it is Beck. It is kind of sad I know but I just forget somehow. Even though it is strange not having Cat or Amanda (I got used to having Amanda around this summer) I am so very happy to be home! It is cold, polluted and unfortunately sunny, but it does not matter because it is Prague. My dear, dark, Prague. Aimee actually hugged me voluntarily when she saw me and Emily nearly lifted me off the ground! I missed those two so much. Aimee is (as she loves to call me) crazy. She may deny it but do not listen to a word! Emily is above crazy but below insane. She may insist that she is in fact terribly insane, but do not listen to a word! So yes, they have not changed much. I must go and eat now. Farewell."

Furlough does something to your mind...Anyway, I would update my journal more often if anything even slightly exiting ever happened. Unfortunately not much of anything happens in a place where the evening news consist of thrilling tales about collapsible strollers and a foiled donut store heist. I am trying to enjoy myself though. Possibly the most wonderful thing about this summer has been my sisters. I love, love, love, love, love them! Even when they borrow my shoes with asking, (Amanda) and throw coke on me (Bethany). In fact there are so many things that bring smiles to my face in South Carolina! Like when people ask me about life in Romania and compliment me on my ability to speak ""Czechin"". The last few weeks have consisted mostly of drinking lots of diet ginger ale, being nice to supporters, making things I will never use and gaining weight. Besides sisters and Julia and the above mentioned delights, I have a really wonderful job teaching english to refugees from Somalia. I love my students! They are  some of the sweetest people I have ever met. Being with them makes my day. Two of Amanda's friends are staying with us this summer and they are really great as well. So there are a few bright spots in a very dark existence. I cannot believe I am saying this, but I cannot wait for summer to end! If you have time, please comment! It would make me very happy :)"

"event","Prague is so beautiful. I realize that more when I am away from it. I miss it so much right now! I have not yet begun to miss it the way I will in July, when it will make me almost physically sick. I feel like I will have almost no real summer break because furloughs do not count as break. When I was younger we only went on furloughs every three years. We would spend lazy summers in Prague where Cat and I would build imaginary worlds in fields of wildflowers and walk to the potraviny to buy marzipan vegetables and long strips of rainbow striped sour candy. In the middle of the summer we would take a trip somewhere like Italy, Croatia or Switzerland. I have some of my fondest memories from those trips. From Italy I have memories of getting blisters in the forum, (forcing me to wear socks with sandals for the rest of the trip) eating ice cream by the Trevi fountain, twilight at the foot of the Spanish steps, and melons for breakfast every day from an outdoor market. I remember that in Croatia the water was bluer than any sky, shell boxes covered in glitter reflected the sunlight better than diamonds, and apple ice cream was best eaten at night with my toes in the Adriatic Sea. My memories from Switzerland are the most hazy because that was the first trip we went on after moving to Prague. What I do remember seems very dreamlike and lovely. I remember seeing the Alps seem to rise out of nothing, I remember an icy, transparent lake, vivid wildflowers and a magical shop filled with nothing but clocks. I know this is all rather sappy and nostalgic, but thinking and writing about these things helps them come alive for me again. I would love to go back to so many places and relive what seems impossible to get back. I am so very melancholy right now! I need to go write a tragic novel...:)  That would give me something to do! I am rather bored...."

Our computer was not working and we went to Arkansas to fetch Beck so I have barely had time to breathe! At the moment I am famished as we have no food in the house except for coffee and cheese bits. Ugh. I am wasting away...My fingers barely have the strength to type...I will prevail though. America is the same as always, shiny, bright,absurdly happy and warm. The strangest thing though, is how everyone smiles! Emily, no one here dresses like a Bohemian! It is nice to look even stranger than I do in Prague. Going to Arkansas was interesting. I will never sit next to Nat for twelve hours again! He laid all over me and drooled. I started crying in a  McDonald's in Tennessee because I was so frustrated, tired and sick of furlough and traveling. I have only been back for a week and I am depressed I have seen Julia though, and I was overjoyed to find that she is still her charming self. She is taller though! Almost as tall as me. I must go and eat lunch (cheese bits and tap water). Fare-thee-well! Oh and one more thing, American bathtubs are so small! They are short and wide (like the people). I miss European bathtubs so! I do like American refrigerators though. Julia's has water and TWO types of ice! Now I really must go, fare-thee-well again."

"event","I have not updated my poor darling journal in forever! I have been mentally and physically exhausted...We are leaving in less then a week for another long, stressful furlough. People who have never been on a furlough often have this charming idea that furlough is rather like an extended vacation. It is so amusing. Emma and I recently talked about furloughs over the phone. Actually she was doing most of the talking at this point in the conversation.
Emily 1: They HUG me and then they say,""welcome home""
Emily 2: Then I say, ""Well I won't be going home until the end of the summer...""
Emily 1: Then they say, ""Well! You are very impertinent! We won't be giving YOU any money to spend at goodwill!""
Ah Emma dear, I truly hope your supporters are not that terrible! Anyway, Beck has deserted me! She is off in Arkansas painting lawn furniture and eating cheerios and American candy. I shall now write about spring banquet! I change subjects quickly... Before we could dress up and dance they tortured us by making us dress up in absurd costumes and act out a pathetic skit. While we were getting ready for the play, the girls got a bit crazy with the make-up! I ended up with lips so red they seemed to have drawn all the color out of my already pale face. I also had so much eye shadow and blush that...well I cannot think of any way to describe how horrific I looked. Emma and Aimee looked even worse. Both Emma and I made the fabulous style statement of high heels with socks! If you want to now what Emilwrewn's dress looked like, try to imagine the ugliest, most matronly, unflattering dress you can. Thankfully we were given plenty of time afterwards to remove make-up and change into our banquet clothes. Emily wore a beautiful yellow flapper dress that she had helped make. She also wore some exquisite jet beads and velvet gloves :) Aimee wore a black velvet skirt that was so perfect for dancing. It looked very dramatic because she had chosen to wear only black and white.  Victoria wore a really pretty black dress. She looked adorable, but she always looks adorable in my opinion. I wore a vintage rose raw silk dress, all my mother's pearls and my 30's shoes :) Miss Andyshak looked really lovely! She wore a velvet dress that reminded me of the twenties and some shoes I really liked, but she took the shoes off when we were dancing. Dancing was as always fun. I really like to dance even if I cannot very well. I have very little rhythm. I taught my dad how to dance, which was rather difficult especially since I was wearing, heels and was about as tall as him. Aimee and Emily danced the Charleston together and everybody started clapping at the end! Aimee was embarrassed :) I want to learn how to swing dance better! Maybe if I work twice as hard I might look half as good as everybody else :) Cat is going to teach Amanda this summer so maybe she will teach me as well. I need to go rest, as I am still a bit sick. I was really, really sick on Monday. I had to call my dad to come get me because I could not make it up the metro stairs. It was truly pathetic"

Actual analogies and metaphors found in high school essays
 
1. Her face was a perfect oval, like a circle that had its two sides 
gently compressed by a Thigh Master.

2. His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like 
underpants in a dryer without Cling Free.

3. He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a 
guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of 
those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country 
speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar 
eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it.

4. She grew on him like she was a colony of E.coli and he was 
room-temperature Canadian beef.

5. She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes 
just before it throws up.

6. Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever.

7. He was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree.

8. The revelation that his marriage of 30 years had disintegrated 
because of his wife's infidelity came as a rude shock, like a surcharge 
at a formerly
surcharge-free ATM.

9. The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a 
bowling ball wouldn't.

10. McBride fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty bag 
filled with vegetable soup.

11. From the attic came an unearthly howl. The whole scene had an 
eerie, surreal quality, like when you're on vacation in another city 
and Jeopardy comes on at 7:00 p.m. instead of 7:30.

12. Her hair glistened in the rain like a nose hair after a sneeze.

13. The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when you 
fry them in hot grease.

14. Long separated by cruel fate, the star-crossed lovers raced across 
the grassy field toward each other like two freight trains, one having 
left Cleveland at 6:36 p.m. traveling at 55 mph, the other from Topeka 
at 4:19 p.m. at a speed of 35 mph.

15. They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences 
that resembled Nancy Kerrigan's teeth.

16. John and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who 
had also never met.

17. He fell for her like his heart was a mob informant and she was the 
East River.

18. Even in his last years, Grandpappy had a mind like a steel trap, 
only one that had been left out so long, it had rusted shut.

19. Shots rang out, as shots are wont to do.

20. The plan was simple, like my brother-in-law Phil. But unlike Phil, 
this plan just might work.

21. The young fighter had a hungry look, the kind you get from not 
eating for a while.

22. He was as lame as a duck. Not the metaphorical lame duck, either, 
but a real duck that was actually lame, maybe from stepping on a land 
mine or something.

23. The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender 
leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.

24. It was an American tradition, like fathers chasing kids around with 
power tools.

25. He was deeply in love. When she spoke, he thought he heard bells, 
as if she were a garbage truck backing up.

26. Her eyes were like limpid pools, only they had forgotten to put in 
any pH cleanser.

27. She walked into my office like a centipede with 98 missing legs."

2. Favorite time of day: Twilight, night. 
3. Favorite city: Prague, followed closely by Cairo.
4. What eye color do you wish you had?  Green. Pear green. Mint green...Moss green! 
5. Favorite item of clothing in your wardrobe: My Egyptian shawl, my sarongs, my Brazilian purses...my ballet flats, my thirties heels, my antique raw silk dress! That is way more then one in case, you, like me, can barely count.
6. What is the most romantic thing someone could do for you? Give me a bouquet of watermelon stripped candy tied with a mauve bow.
7. Favorite flower: Poppies, orchids and magnolias.
8. What does your room look like? Eclectic. Pretty clean, just do not open the wardrobe if you value your life. Colorful, lots of red, peach, black gold, green, pink and blue. Once upon a time I had a color scheme but it failed dreadfully.
9. What was your mother's grandmother's name? This question definitely says a lot about me. Francis Rose Jeruska.
10. What are your favorite names? Mikhail, Kolya, Nicholai, or Kipp (Kipling) for a boy and Jade, Gwyneth, Blythe, Owin and Beatrix for a girl."

"event","So Aimee is back! Or more importantly, my darling twizzler has presumably arrived in Prague safely! Beck was like, ""Would it not be funny if she forgot?"" hehe...not really. This is not to put any pressure on you Amilili dearest, I'll forgive you if you forgot. You did not forget though did you? Call me and tell me about all your adventures when you get over jet lag. I missed thee! I have really missed twizzlers though... ;) The last I saw Aimee (at book study)we had the following conversation:
Me: Do not go!!!!
Aimee: I must...
Me: NO!!!
Aimee: I will be back soon.
Me: Fine. :(
Aimee: Farewell
Me: Do not die and get me twizzlers!
Aimee: I'll try.
Me: It is not that hard. What kind of twizzlers do I want?
Aimee: The kind you can pull apart.
Me: Right!
Aimee: Farewell.
Me: Ok. Bye. Twizzlers! (I laugh cruelly as she closes the door) Twizzlers! Twizzlers! 
I value Aimee so much that her friendship is as important as twizzlers. With most people I probably would of said: In case of an emergency don't save yourself, save the twizzlers. The  pull and peel kind. Oh and have a nice trip! Aimee and I had another lovely conversation recently about furloughs.
Me: Its funny you know, even though furloughs are hard, there are some fun things about them like cracker barrel and skittles.
Aimee: I know, everyone is always saying ""are you exited about seeing your grandmother?"" and you are like: TWIZZLERS...LEMONADE...SLUSHIES!!!!
       ~15 nice things about furlough~ 
  (it took a great deal of thought and hard work to come up with 15 things)
   1. 'Manda
   2. JULIA!!!!
   3. twizzlers
   4. skittles
   5. cracker barrel
   6. slushies
   7. taco bell
   8. wendy's
   9. ahem...ah
  10. garage sales
  11. goodwill (right emma?) 
  12. the library
  13. ah......
  14. giant watermelons?
  15. Hah, I thought of one. Macaroni and cheese! :)

"event","Amilili, Emilwren and I recently had to do a school project about the velvet revolution. We decided to create an award worthy film with um...no title (at least none that I can remember).
It went something like this. 
     ~Scene 1~
(Emily, Beck and I are outside Suchdol in a field, Beck is filming for us 
Beck zooms in on a sign that says: Welcome to Bratislava, another grim Communist city. It should look like all the others. We hope your stay is pleasant and brief.  
(It has a Communist star instead of a sun and stick people raising their arms towards a Stalin stick person ) 
Beck: We began our journey in Bratislava....(in the back ground you can hear Emily and I talking. Emily and I enter pretending we are in a skoda)
Emily: Chuhga, ghugga chuga chug...Bang! Ehcck...
(Emily and I begin to sing ""If you are going to San Francisco...."")  
Emily: Oh no! The car has broken down!  
Me: What did you expect? It is a skoda...
Emily: True. But how will we get to Prague now? WE ARE GOING TO MISS THE REVOLUTION!
Me: I know! We can hitchhike!
Emily: Excellent idea!
Me: Oh look there is a Soviet tank! They are probably going to Prague.
(Emily begins to sing the Czech anthem and I hum a completely different tune off key) 
Emily: They are leaving us! WAIT! Come back!!!!
Me: I guess we will just have to walk...I am in the wrong shoes for this!
(Emily and I skip off while singing 'San Francisco'. Later we reappear as Beck hums music from the lord of the rings. Very dramatic)
Emily: Ah look we are here! (Beck zooms in on the castle in the distance)
Emily: But where are all the protesters?
Me: They must be on lunch break.
Emily: Ah...
Emily: Well lets go downtown.
(Emily and I skip off in the wrong direction)
       ~Scene 2~
(Miss Andyshak is now filming, we are downtown at Narodni Trida. Emily and I skip up while singing and run into Aimee)
Me: Jana!
Aimee: Jana!
Me: (to Emily) Have you met my friend Jana? Jana, this is Jana.
Aimee: So nice to meet you Jana!
Emily: You too Jana!
Me: We are all Jana!!!! Hehehehe....
Me: We are here for the revolution!
Aimee: I am afraid you guys are too late!
Emily: What! They started without us!?!?
(I begin to cry on Emily's shoulder)
Aimee: The president has already resigned...
Me: We had a president?
(Aimee explains the current situation to us. We all decide to go to Wenceslas Square)
       ~Scene 3~
(We are all on the square now, at the top with the museum in the background. We have a dull conversation and then we SHAKE OUR KEYS ON WENCESLAS SQUARE)"

I will miss how she snuggled up against me when she was afraid, the feel of her head on my arm before I fell asleep and how she used to try and defend me against Nat :) With dogs you cannot exactly say ""she is in a better place"" she is just dead. Gone forever. She was my darling and friend. She listened and never interrupted, liked zlato, shared my french fries with me, snuggled with me and let me bury my head in her fur and cry...I never thought I would say this but I really need a hug at the moment. I am going to go cry and mope about some more."

Cat: So profound...
Dad: What was it about?
Cat: Well Ben Affleck was the evil tomato, who was destroying the world of horticulture freaks.
Me: No Beck, remember Ben  Affleck was the cruel cute cucumber! Duh!I cannot believe you forgot that. 
Cat: Uh... Divya, did you ever bring that film back?
Dad: Wait you are serious! Alisha where is it? The late fee is going to exorbitant!

My father is rather gullible, so is Nate though, even more so in fact.

Micheal: I changed my mind Emily you will marry Orlando Bloom
Emily: gross.
Me: Why do I have Brad Pitt? I want Matt Damon!

If you read Emilwren's journal you will hear of our lovely school trip to the toy museum. I have decided to elaborate though, it was extremely memorable. We had an uneventful trip down to Malostranska, the fun began on the tram. It was  very crowded and Amilili and I were separated and I yelled dramatically over the throng of bored, miserable humanity, ""Amililiiiiiiiii, where hast thou gone?"" Actually I did not. I considered it though. The was an entire group of rather mentally challenged people on the tram with us. I believe Aimee was inspired by them. I, alas, was too busy trying to hold on to a suspiciously sticky railing to be inspired by anything (accept for the charming pink and blue car that drove by). The toy museum is on the other side of the castle, so it was a bit of a long walk. I suggested that Ami sing off key, and she kindly agreed. Aimee can sing beautifully normally, so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Oh. My. Goodness! Amilii was hyper, almost as hyper as me in fact. She decided to act om..odd. Yes, odd is the only word that could be used to describe the sight of Aimee stumbling about looking drunk and singing as mentioned before, off key next to the castles glorious beauty. I think you have lived in Europe too long when you act insane beside cathedrals.

Me: Oh..look (I point at a halo over a bald saints head)a frisbee with a hole in it!   
Aimee: Yay! Frisbee..Frisbee...FRISBEE!!!!Gahhhgh lum de la!!!
(By this time we have a lot of people watching us. Luckily, Aimee had my arm to lean on, otherwise she would be on the ground drooling)
Me: Wow, Eyrope is sooo prettty!
(Aimee begins to make gagging noises)
Aimee: Ooooohh!

This is all to prove to you that I have not a shred of dignity left. I have discovered that very little  embarrasses me. Thank God for my darling friends who have helped me after numerous public spectacles to realize this."

hey y'all.. this is gonna be quick but if y'all could all just really pray for quinea right now.  this past week she, my other friend, and i were in england in the friend's house for a few days and the second day quinea got sick so she just slept and stuff and then the next day we drove to the airport to go home and quinea got really really sick and couldn't fly home with us.  the mom took her to the doctor who rushed her to the hospital and so now she is there under intensive care with some meningitis or something and is totally knocked out and all.  the doctors aren't totally sure what is wrong so they can't really treat her til they find out.  In the ambulance she totally deterioated and all.  her parents are in rome at the moment but were told to fly up immediately.  our friend's mom is flying to south africa tomorrow too so she won't be there and all.  so PLEASE pray for quinea!! pray she gets better soon. also pray that her parents get there quick and are able to find flights.  pray for her little brother and sis that they wouldn't be too scared. especially pray for quinea... and that she wouldn't be scared. thanks y'all....

lacey

Please pray that she gets better and will have strength and that her parents  can get there as soon as possible!!!!!"

"event","The last few days have been memorable.
Friday: 
I thought I was going to go downtown with Allison, but she was sick sadly. Hannah called me and asked if we could do something, but I told her I could not because I was going out with Allison. So I called her back after the thing with Allison fell through and said,""I changed my mind Hannah, :) lets go downtown"" We went out to eat at (bet you guys can guess) Bohemia Bagel. We were walking down the square when a bug flew into my eye and Hannah and I spent about ten minutes trying to get it out. I had to take out my contact. People were giving us odd stares so I felt compelled to grimace intimidatingly at them. I believe it was unsuccessful, apparently   I am not even slightly terrifying...;) Hannah is even worse then I...Anyhow, we went to Sanu Babu after eating and looked about and tried on hats. We went to the stands and Xaja bought gifts for her friends in Macedonia. The Yurkovichs are going back to Macedonia for a visit on Thursday. We talked about their life in Macedonia quite a bit on the way downtown. They used to go to Greece to watch movies and go bowling. They also would eat at Applebees in Thesslonica...They have Applebees in Greece! Hannah said one of her friends (a gypsy) left school when she was fifteen to get married...thats younger then me. I asked Hannah if she thought I was mature enough to get married and she just laughed. I presume that meant no. I could not agree more. I cannot even close my wardrobe or make proper pasta! We were standing on the little road that you go on to go from old town square to Wenceslas square when the we heard a distant roaring...The sound of bells, music and the cries of the faithful rose in the balmy air.The Hari Krishna came dancing by. I had not seen a Hari Krishna demonstration in quiet some time...It brought back fond memories of summer time in the city. For those of you who might not of seen a Hari Krishna parade, they wear orange and other bright colors and long robes. They shout and sing and play  tambourines and make an incredible amount of noise. Everyone makes way for them and they go skipping through the downtown. They have some of the most interesting hairstyles ever. Several vintage clothing shops later we went to cream and dream and bought two huge scoops of ice cream for each of us. She got coffee and caramel and I got strawberry and banana. Cream and dream is almost as good as Italy...I love Italian ice cream!!!! I love Italy too, I want to go again someday. We lounged on benches on a quiet back street and ate ice cream for almost an hour, it was so fun...
Saturday:
After drama practice I layed about and did nothing...laalalaa, 'twas delightful. Emma and I had a rather dramatic and poetic online conversation. If you are reading my livejournal blog, you can see most of our conversation at Emma's blog, on my friends list. If you are reading this on xanga, you have very bad luck...:( hehee... (that is an evil laugh)
Sunday: 
Well, I knew today was going to be interesting because I had to do an extremely embarrassing  mime in front of the entire church. I was nervous but all went well. The only problem I had was when I hit Micheal...I was sort of depressed for various reasons and I did not really think of the importance of easter until I was home, alone in my room. I prayed for  awhile, it was very soothing. I love feeling close to God, I think it feels more wondrous than  any feeling on earth. To know that he is listening and guiding my life is so....I cannot think of a good word for it, hmm... indescribable :) Aimee made me laugh after church even though I felt like frowning, so thank you Amilili for your friendship, your funny creepy laugh that you do whenever I command :) and you sweet ""Help""! Nothing makes me feel like laughing more accept perhaps when Emily says: ""Amilileh play the vhedding march"" in a strange accent. Love you darlings! (I am tempted to say 'dahlings', but I will resist) :) I went downtown again this afternoon, and ate at Bohemia Bagel again...My parents gave me an azure crystal necklace. I can wrap it around my neck four times! 
Fare-thee-well!
Happy Easter!"

"event","I took a quiz online called: 'Make your own band' here are my results...hehe :)!   
	
Emilwren Trca,  Lishrena Gabrielle,  Amilili Johnson 
               ~The Cobblestones~
  Oooooh, The Cobblestones. This band is HEAVY. Guitarist Amilili and drummer Lishrena Gabrielle basically beat their instruments into submission with an almost superhuman skill and speed. And just when you thought death metal never sounded so good, Emilwren sneaks into the mix with devastatingly beautiful and menacing keyboards. Few bands have what it takes to sound so huge. That there are only three people in the band makes it even more amazing. These girls are: Pure. Epic. Genius. The Cobblestones is the new standard by which all metal bands should be judged. I really love their deep song 'Lili's HELP'. 'Amilile play the vhedding march' was also fascinating. 
  Though Reba Rock loved ""The Cobblestones,"" it took a while for their brand of to really catch on with the local underground scene. While most of the bands in the scene just wanted to ROCK, The Cobblestones was committed to doing things differently, crafting sophisticated songs about social and political issues. Emilwren Trca and Amilili Johnson got fed up with playing to audiences of one or two people every night, so they tried to urge head lyricist Lishrena Gabrielle to make the songs less heavy. When she refused, they quit and formed another band with ""American Idol"" reject Ryan Starr (Narcissus Bleeds) that went on to win an MTV Music Video award and enjoy some modest success. Lishrena Gabrielle toiled on in obscurity, writing complicated, gorgeous songs about the issues. Her songs were eventually studied in college classes around the world. Harvard's is entitled: ""The Cobblestones: Deconstructing the Myth and Music of Lishrena Gabrielle."""

The summit was in Slovakia, not Slovenia 

By Matt Reynolds
Staff Writer, The Prague Post 
March 2, 2005


""So what pools am I in?"" I asked the woman behind a counter at the press center. 

""Name and medium?"" she responded. A pool is a group of journalists granted access to a big event such as the joint Bush-Putin press conference. She glanced at a list, heard my answers, and laughed heartily as though I'd told her a good joke. 

Rule No. 1 at a summit: Only big media get access to the pools. Everyone else watches on TV, which, in the case of 1,000 or so accredited journalists in Bratislava Feb. 23-25, meant two Jumbotrons at a conference center. 

Other summit rules: Journalists secretly hope for summiteers to break the monotony by doing something embarrassing such as mispronouncing the name of a country or tripping and falling at the airport. Also: Nobody cares about the host country's PR events, and off-duty officials are apt to say funny things.

Overheard from a Slovak investment guru pointing at a group of pretty Slovak volunteers dressed in striking, red skirt suits: ""They are my country's best investment incentive."" 

A group of reporters in the cubicle behind me spoke with hopeful glee of the possibility that Bush would accidentally call Slovakia Slovenia. In 1999, he famously made the reverse mistake with the Slovenian prime minister. 

As background, the reporters were interested in knowing how much misaddressed mail Slovaks and Slovenians traded each year. As it turns out, the Slovak newspaper SME ran a story the next day pointing out that USA Today, the United States' second-largest newspaper, had labeled Slovenia Slovakia on an illustrative map of Bush's trip. The SME article reported Slovakia sent 602 kilograms (1,327 pounds) of misaddressed mail to Slovenia last year.

Bush didn't mix up Europe's Slo-prefix nations this time, not even in a half-hour speech given in the finger-numbing cold on Hviezdoslav Square in Bratislava's center. His attempt at a thank you in Slovak, dakujem, sounded like yak-wee-um, but the 4,000 Slovaks who turned out seemed gratified anyway. Earlier in the trip, though, as the Czech press pointed out, Bush committed a faux pas by shaking hands with gloves on when he arrived at the airport. 

Putin made a very different airport entrance, looking every bit the hard-ass as he deplaned into a light snowstorm without a jacket. He smiled barely at all, and ducked into a waiting Mercedes. 

The biggest grin of the summit belonged to Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, who went in for a half-hug of Bush at the airport and later beamed through a press conference with the U.S. president like a proud father of the bride.

Some disappointment crept into the faces of Slovak functionaries at the press center as it dawned on them that the international media weren't interested in their junkets to mountain spas and conferences on Slovak politics. A presentation on pension reform by the labor minister drew about 10 reporters. 

On the whole, though, the hosts appeared pleased. Slovakia reaped the PR value of having the word Bratislava on the front page of every big newspaper in the world, and workers at the press center seemed proud of pulling off a major international event botch-free. 

Complaints from journalists were few except for a Russian reporter who demanded a summit-issue press-card strap, also known as a lanyard. He had either lost the lanyard that came with his summit pack, or, as he claimed, there was never one in his pack. The Slovaks finally coughed up another lanyard, which they had in limited quantities, but not before the Russian shouted, ""Great Slovak workmanship!"" and a Slovak diplomat muttered, ""What a Russian!""

The grand event, the Bush-Putin press conference, seemed like a love-in by comparison. Warmth and civility oozed from the Jumbotrons as Bush praised ""Vladimir"" as the ""kinda fella' who, when he says yes, means yes, and when he says no, means no."" And, in case anyone missed that, ""The president declare[d] his absolute support for democracy... and when he tells you something, he means it.""

The next day, however, most of the press had gazed into the tea leaves of the 20-minute conference, which included a few oblique comments on rule of law and freedom of the press, and surmised, to quote a typical headline, ""Bush criticizes Putin on democracy."""

"event","I recently read an article that said food reminds people of certain things. People supposedly eat foods they ate growing up when they are upset. So comfort food might not be fatting or sweet, but it will remind us of something pleasant or comforting. Interesting... I am rather bored so here is a list of foods and what they remind me of.
 Bagels: Aimee (Aimee eats a bagel almost every day for lunch)
 Frozen french fries: Aimee's old house (we did not have anything else to eat when I stayed there)
 Homemade pizza: Emily (Emily makes very good pizza)
 Strawberries: Julia (We used to eat these together and have discussions about very deep topics)
 Soup: My mom, home (We eat soup almost every day)
 Twizzlers: Twix, America (I am not sure why they remind me of Twix, but you cannot get them here so the    latter one makes perfect sense)
 Zlato: School, Prague (I eat it for lunch when I am at school)
 Watermelon: My grandparents
 Banana Popsicles: My grandparents and their house
 Tonic water: Conferences (At most conferences this is all they have to drink)
 Pineapple: Brazil
 Grits with yellow corn meal: Prague 4  
 Rice crackers with cream cheese: Prague 4
 Honey mustard sauce: Cairo (I only ate this once in Cairo but now it always reminds me of Cairo)
 Sugar free mango sorbet: Cairo (After I went inside the great pyramid I got really sick, and my parents    bought me  mango sorbet to cheer me up) 
 JoJo candy: Prague 4, Rose and Purr (I used to be Beck's slave and serve her JoJo candy on silver trays)
 Marzipan shaped like mice: Childhood (On warm days Beck and I would walk to a cukarna in our area and buy  marzipan mice...they were so good, I have not had one in years)"

My peers, lately, have found companionship through means of intoxication - it makes them sociable. I, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness - it is all that I have - and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well.

"event","This morning when first woke, my eyes looked green and the sun was shinning! I normally hate the sun, but after a long winter I appreciate it. Because of these things I know it is going to be a lovely day. Wednesday started out badly but got slowly better. Dad woke me up at 6:04 in the morning and was like ""get up Lishke, time to go to therapy"". I thought he was insane because my appointment was in an hour and a half! How long does he think it takes me to dress I wonder? I was, and still am, rather sick, I had to drag myself out of bed. Therapy was the same as always. I am ushered past the wrought iron gate up to a  chandelier filled room with its original paneling. Canadian medical is in the loveliest building! I wish I was wealthy enough to buy it from them...It could be so exquisite. My shockingly slender therapist tells me she thinks I might need to lose a bit of weight. Hmmm...I have not weighed myself in a while, but if Beck weighs 102 pounds then I probably weigh about 113 or something like that. I never thought that was too heavy. My therapist does not eat enough. As soon as I enter every time she says ""disrobe please"", I think I have lived in Europe too long. It does not bother me at all anymore to take off all my clothes for therapy. What does bother me is the chandelier that hangs directly over me, it always looks like it is going to fall on me. After therapy Emilwren came over and we watched Quo Vadis together. We watched the Polish version that had been dubbed into Czech. Emily translated parts of it for me. Thank you Emilwren! Translating seems tiring to me. It was really fun. The film, like the book, has some really great parts and some really cheesy parts. Here are a few lines that make me wonder what the author was thinking:

""I saw her, and the light passed through her!"" 

""How is the girl? The one who is too narrow at the hips.""

""I know I look like an idiot...""

It was very graphic. There were two parts that really disturbed me, one was when they cut their wrist and the other was when the christians were killed by the lions. After finishing Quo Vadis I went to book study and Emily wondered about downtown. Aimee and I met Victoria and Emily at the metro after book study and went to the Olsen's house together. We ate spaghetti and meatballs, watched about half of a movie and played assassins. We left at about ten. All the other girls were going to the metro so mrs. Olsen said to me ""Micheal could escort you home if you want"" I felt like laughing, but did not. I am capable of going home by myself. It was a gorgeous night! There was a warm breeze and the sky was deep blue and starless... I enjoyed the freedom of going home by myself. It was so quiet and peaceful. It gave me time to think. I waited for the longest time at the bus stop and loved every moment. I sauntered about admiring my shoes. When I woke up on Wednesday I decided I did not care one bit what other people thought! I was going to wear exactly what I wanted to. So I wore an antique petticoat, lavender stockings, strands of lavender and peach beads, my thirties dancing heels and my communist jacket. I love full skirts and heels. I do not care if I am rather prissy. I love it. I almost forgot the highlight of the day, Emily gave me a sarong! A beautiful red and black one! I love sarongs! Wednesday was wonderous...."

quirkynefret:  hah

He he, I hope you guys do not mind me using bits of our conversation. On Sunday Beck and I went to see 'Finding Neverland'. Beck hated it, just about any film she hates is worth watching. Afterward we ate dinner and waited for dad. 
Halfway through dinner I wrote a poem on my napkin. I will share it with you, however you must not laugh even though I cannot hear you!

 This moment seems to me
 Like an orchestra before a symphony
 The air tempered with twilight sparks
 Lights flicker in the shadows

 Musician's hands of grace
 Illumination on every face
 Electric, aglow 
 Preparing for what will be

 Practiced cords float by
 Chandeliers and a painted sky
 Preparing for what will be
 Like an orchestra before a symphony"

I'm more worried about dad than I am about me.. he's still not doing to well, but then,he's going through his brother's stuff, when the guy should have lived another 10 years or so. I'm going down to Innisfail tomorrow to spend the weekend with him, so that at least I can be there to give him a hug & help with the cleaning etc. I don't know what else I can do, really. 

My sister will not e coming over now. She's changed her mind.. apparently dad had offered to pay her flights, but she feels that it would be a better idea for him to spend the money on going over there later this year to have a holiday with them - spend time with the kids and everyone, not just her for the funeral time.. Think nothing of the fact that he needs the support & family around him now.. No. They can't bend to anyone else's needs... never have, never will. 

Forgive me if that sounds narky, but this is the third time in four years that I have had to bear the brunt of one (or both) of my parents practically falling over because she thinks it would be better a different way, or can't be effing bothered.. 

gah. 

Also this afternoon, I had to convince mum that 'it's worth' coming up for the funeral. Granted shehas her stuff to deal with as well, however, this is the funeral of a man who attended both of her parent's funeral's (when he didn't need to), also has been a good friend to her over the last 36 years or so. We're talking about the brother of her husband of 36 years - ignore the fact that my parents are now seperated - they are still friends, and I'm sure that dad needs to know that he still has friends - people that care about him, at very least. I have difficulty believing that my mother would be so closed as to assume that dad wouldn't want her there. Or for that matter, that John wouldn't appreciate the fact that she would make the effort for him. Or perhaps she thought that dad would not appreciate the fact that she would make an effort for his brother. 

Welcome to the peanut gallery."

further. I've decided to drop one subject at Uni & take a lighter load for the semester.. it extends my graduation date, but I really can't focus on so many things, and do well with all of them at the moment. Work is taking too much of my energy, and any changes I make there would be more gradual, and I need a more instant release from pressure at the moment. I can't change the fact that D is working away, and again, changing my perspective on that is a more gradual process. So, all that remains that I can 'get rid of' so to speak, is Uni. Given that it is the 21st March (ie: before the census date) I can drop a subject with no academic or financial penalty. 

So I clicked the right buttons to do that about 15 minutes ago. 

I dropped the law subject, not the policy one - I chose to keep the policy subject because I have more prior understanding of it than law.. law was doing my head in. 

Have been trying to rest on & off this afternoon, but I haven't been able to sleep at all.. damnit."

Interesting. D is away. He has started his job out at the mines - two weeks on, one off. It's now 5 sleeps till he's home. I miss him. Horribly. Not all day every day, but I have moments where I seem to fall apart. That's both a good and a bad sign. 

His mother sent me a txt today: ""Hello Love. Do you have a husband again yet? And how are you managing? Lots of love R & T.""

""Husband""?? Did I miss something? I don't remember being proposed to .. let alone a ceremony. 

It is nice to be accepted by the family, that IS a very good thing... but sometimes, its a tad odd to accepted THAT much that she has us married already... 

Speaking of which... it's almost time for the nightly phone call.. adios. Hope all is well."

"event","Hi. 

So today was my last day at work. I start the new job of Jan 8th. In between times, I have Christmas in Brisbane, and New Years back here. 

It felt odd leaving today. I don't know if I can express it yet. Closest I can get is excited at the new challenge (and two weeks off), but really sad to be leaving the people there. 

Further, My dad's best mate is in hospital - something to do with his lungs, though his family aren't yet sure of exactly what's wrong (well, at last contact they weren't, anyway). Zappo is kinda my god-father, and I'm more than a tad worried. He went in for an op this morning at 7.30 or something, and emerged from recovery at about 5pm. :(

I'm a bit off kilter tonight. The guys are watching some crappy kung fu movie & I'm bored. But at the same time, I can't think of anything I would want to be doing, and I can't think clearly full stop. I assume the combo of last day & more yet hospital dramas. I could really do without more hospital dramas. 

I have so far received a perpetual calendar, pen & chocolate, a wall calendar, chocolates & coffee, an espresso machine, body shop strawberry body lotion, body butter & body wash, cash & a gift voucher for a massage as Christmas gifts.

"event","The last six months or so I have been feeling very stifled at work - the position I'm in there essentially (by it's very nature) locks me in to doing the same thing over and over and over... and I'm a person that needs variety in the work that I do. Also, in terms of advancement, I have been asking for (even a minor) step up to include both more responsibility and variety, however for one logistical reason or another, it hasn't happened every time. I love the people I work with, and I will miss them significantly, but I cannot stay there lest I do more damage to my sense of freedom and ambition. I have been slowly and quietly looking for other jobs for the last few months, however I have only seen one that was worth applying for (for my personal needs) and in this case, the application close date coincided with my grandfather's death and my final exam for the semester, so the application did not get submitted. 

Then out of the blue, a previous employer contacted me, offered me my previous supervisor's position, with a salary package that consists of Au$4K more and 2 weeks leave more than I currently am on. The nature of the role includes more variety, advancement, there is flexibility within the organisation if needed, and car available as well. Also, given the study I'm doing (Governance & Public Policy), the position offers liaison with Government departments, and the organisation has links with local, state and federal members of Parliament. The position also offers internal and external training, reporting, staff supervision, and management of internal departments. The CEO of the organisation is heavily supportive of professional development opportunities, and there are still links with employment services as well. 

Overall, it's an offer I cannot say no to at this time. 

As I said, I will miss the guys I'm with at the moment, and branch management have not done anything wrong by me (though head office is another story), but I can't stay there any longer... 

I realise that this is 'going back' in a sense, but it's moving up, and offering links to where I want to get to eventually, with more money in the mean time."

Thanks for all the kind wishes following my last post. The funeral went quite smoothly despite the threat of family arguments and it was great to have the lot of them here etc. My sister came over from NZ for the week, and I haven't seen her since 2002, so that was really cool. Having mum here for over a week nearly drove me insane, and I worried a tad too much about having mum and dad in the same house once he arrived... And then also had trouble getting my final assignment for uni done at the same time (it was due the Monday following the funeral). Yep. As they say, when it rains, it pours. 

That's my brief update for the moment. We shall see how things go over the weekend.. Yeah.."

"event","The operation went well, he has blood flow returned to his foot, but he seems to have cognitively degenerated. He already has a significant level of dementia, but he seems worse today than the last time I saw him before he went to hospital. He's slurring his words, which he has never done before, and there's very little recognition. When I went to see him last night, he seemed to barely recognise that there was someone there at all... This morning though, while he didn't call me by name (not even a wrong name), I did see a glimmer of recognition. 

So much has happened in the last 48 hrs. I went to work yesterday and shouldn't have, but staying home would have made me feel useless, and if I went to the hospital in thr morning, I would have run into the horrible uncle that I never want to see again. But, by going to work, I got dragged into a court case. WTF? Yea... We had an incident at work just under a year ago, and it has finally come up for trial (a client made threats, etc, etc)... So yesterday consisted of 8-5.30 work, home for a bit, to the hospital for an hour so so, then down to the police station to make a statement.. then home, a couple of phone calls, pace around the house for a while, and then to bed. Called in sick for today and tomorrow. 

Spoke to mum at about midday, and here's the next installment: my uncle in Townsville (who has previously been diagnosed with throat cancer) may be out of remission, and has to go to Brisbane for scans sometime in the next week.. So mum is kinda torn between seeing her father, and her brother.. If she stays in Brisbane to see her brother, it means that the load for granddad is left with me.. and I can't tell her to not see him, I know she needs to. 

Thing is, I'm not sure if I have enough strength and energy to deal with granddad...

"event","so today. Today I had to make a decision regarding the fate of my grandfather. I got a call from mum this morning at 7.50am - I was already at work, but he had just been taken to hospital with a serious blood clot in his lower left leg. After much fluffing about, talking to nurses, doctors and surgeons, I (as the only blood relative living in the same town) had to decide between the following options:

Option 1. A fairly minor operation to remove the clot. Now this option has several possibilities and consequences: 
a) given his general health, going under an epidural, he may have difficulty with recovering from the operation as a process (possibility of heart problems during, or developing pneumonia following surgery); 
b) the operation may not work - there's no guarantee that the entire clot would be removed, and that it would not reform following the operation;
c) if it does work, all good. No further action required. 

Option 2. Major surgery to amputate the lower part of his left leg. 
a) this would completely remove the possibility of the clot recurring, and given his general lack of mobility anyway, the disability would not be much of a problem to him. 
b) given his general health, he would me more likely to have problems with a general anesthetic and major surgery again heart/pneumonia;

3. Do nothing (almost). Let the clot stay, make him comfortable (pain-free), the foot goes gangrenous, he eventually dies from various septic infections. This does not include the problems associated with surgery/anesthetic however it's also not a nice way to go.

4. Should the clot reform following Option 1, we would have to follow with either Option 2 and amputate; or Option 3 and do nothing. Taking option 1 + 2 would mean putting him through not one, but two surgeries in a few weeks, giving him less chance of long-term survival, and higher chance of heart/pneumonia issues. 

I've not had a good day. 

I went with Option 1. If it works, it works, and we've removed something that is causing pain, and have removed the potential for the situation to worsen. However, if it doesn't work, (following discussion with my mother, and aunt & cousin) we'll go with Option 3. There's no point in putting him under that much stress to remove a problem, where the cure may kill him as easily as the disease. 

He went in for surgery at 2.30pm, and came out of recovery at 5.30pm - so far so good. He's been stable since the operation, and his foot is showing signs of improvement. However this doesn't mean that he's out of the water - we still need to see if it reforms, and does he develop further complications? 

Time will tell, I hate waiting..."

1. I love holidays. I spent a week & a half in the Brisvegas. Caught up with Chrissy, my mum, <lj user=""niveau"">, and a few others. Short points:
<ul>
<li>Brisbane in no longer 'my town'. I found it kind of annoyed me, I guess I've gotten used to the laid-back attitude of Cairns.</li>
<li>I am so glad I am no longer with my ex. 5 min was enough to make me realise how great D is.</li>
<li><lj user=""niveau""> is a fabulous host.</li>
<li>My mother needs to calm herself down and accept that she will  not always have all the answers to everything. She drove me nuts with a million questions she 'needs' to have answered. </li>
<li>The application is in. Waiting to hear back. What for? It's my application for a Post-graduate Diploma in Governance & Public Policy with UQ. Wish me luck.</li>
<li>I have a lot of crap I no longer need in storage. Though the stuff is now at my mum's place, I still wonder why I paid so much, for so long, to keep the stuff I don't want. *cue Fight Club* ""The things you own, end up owning you.""</li>
<li>If iI have to look at one more bridesmaid dress, I will kill her. I love her, but I'll do it.</li>
</ul>

2. I got home Wednesday night (late, thank you to flight controllers in Melbourne going on strike), to find that the flatmate Ben is not home yet, D had missed me :D, and that nothing much changes in a week and a half, apart from a whole lot of gardening..

3. Went for a wander yesterday, went in to work briefly, just to say hi. They're all stressed and according to them, 2 things were apparent. A. I look so relaxed, and B. My hair has grown 'Heaps - it's so long!"" From there, I went to Civility, for a facial. Lovely. That really was great, highly recommended for anyone considering it. 

4. Have an appointment this afternoon for a pap smear. Again, please wish me luck. Though there 'shouldn't' be anything wrong, I'm always nervous about it. This is all part of my ""I still have time off & I'm doing things I've been meaning to do for a while, but never get time to get around to"" plan for the last few days of my leave.

Enjoy your days, pretty people."

There's photos, so far, taken from mainly around our house, though I will be getting more pics from around town as well. There are also 2 avi files, take care with volume when you get to them, cause you'll get to hear the wind & stuff. If you have any trouble with viewing, let me know, I'll see what I can do.

I also have some pics taken later in the day by SES crew in Innisfail & Mourilyan, in a powerpoint file. I only got those by email today, so tomorrow I should get time to grab the pics out & post them (with credit). Stay tuned for that.

<lj-cut text=""rambling exegesis. cause I need it."">

Weird, weird coincidence, but on my lunch break today, I ran into my horrible uncle (mum's brother). Apparently the roads between here & Innisfail opened today (I think the whole town came up to go shopping & get a meal at Stockland). He lives at Kurrimine Beach (which got slammed). They are ok, and though they have a roof, they have no windows, and all the internal walls upstairs blew out. Weird that it didn't pop the roof, but very lucky. For the most of it, they were inside their car, in the enclosed garage underneath the house. Nothing else they could do. He did tell me that he's been in touch with most of the family down there (mostly the ones that we haven't been able to get hold of) & they are mostly fine. Thankfully. Some minor property damage, but nothing massive. Actually, it's my horrible uncle who suffered the most. I could be a bitch and call it karma, but hey, I can't lay his actions responsible for the suffering of so many.

My other uncle in Innisfail (dad's brother), was also very lucky. He lives in the house that used to be my grandparents, and it's an <em>old</em> Queenslander on concrete stilts. He lost the carport, and because the place is all tongue & groove panelling, and so old, it just shook & vibrated so much that the window panes fell out. However, he still has the roof, and the walls. All the stuff stored & packed under the house got blown/tipped over, most of it broke, and is waterlogged if it isn't broken. There's mud & leaves all through the house & broken glass from one end of the property to the other, and the roof from the set of flats across the road is all over his property, but he is alive, and well, and still has a safe dwelling. The house next door is ok, but the one after that losst part of it's roof. (I still remember the people who <em>still</em> live there from when I grew up, spent so much time at that house.. Nana's place almost every afternoon after school.)

I have heard so many stories where ""if the tree had fallen the other way, we would have lost the house.."" etc. So, so many very, very, very lucky people around. My best friend's parents in Mena Ck are the same. No shed left (it's all down the back paddock, but not up at the house), the garage wall blew out, and the two HUGE leopard trees that <em>were</em> in the front yard, are now lying down... and they fell towards to road, not the house. I am just amazed. Knowing that property, if those trees had gone anywhere near the house, it would not be there today.

Relatives up the tableland haven't done much better. One set (just near the top of the range) at least has been told told it will be <em>at least</em> 2 weeks before they have a chance of getting power restored. they have trees down everywhere & have no shed left. The tractor that was in the shed (a really old, really heavy, steel klunker which was left by the last people that owned the property) was moved two feet by the wind after the shed had gone.

Other family friends near Yungaburra have trees on the roof, trees fallen on both sides of the house (as in - you can't walk between the tree & the house) though the roof is in tact. Trees <em>just</em> missed the water tank, shed gone, paddocks look like a bomb went off. They have also lost a cow. Can't find the poor thing anywhere. (I've actually heard a few stories like that with missing animals, from the standard ""dog/cat ran away scared"", to lost chickens, cows, horses.. all sorts)

The clients I have in at the moment, it's so draining - all they want to do is talk about the cyclone, and while I do too (to an extent), I still have to keep them on track & do what we have to do. But at the same time, I know it's part of the healing process & I can't deny them that. I'm so tired, I still haven't really slept properly. Still getting nightmare images of what I know people I care about went through. 

Most people around Cairns now have power, though a workmate who lives on a property in Gordonvale will still take another week at least (the line between the house & the pole was taken out by a tree, so he needs to get that reconnected to the house, before he gets power connected). At least he now has a generator so he can run the sewerage pump..

Searching the news sites online, I found photos submitted by several people I went through high school with, most of the pics show their houses which don't exist any more. 

Speaking of High School, some of the pics from the SES guys show my high school - 2nd story has disappeared. You can see some bits of walls & furniture left, but it looks like (again) a bomb went off inside. Most schools with major damage are saying that it will be at least April at the earliest, if not June, before they are operational. </lj-cut>


The company I work for has donated labour hire for the clean up - we found the people, we're paying their wages. This decision was made in our head office in Melbourne & emailed to all offices. I cried when I read it. It's just that I was feeling like there was nothing I could do, when all of a sudden, there it is. And, of course with this whole thing being so close to home for me (being my home town, and also geographically not-so-far-away), I was just so touched that <em>they cared</em>. 

Stockland Centre Management are running a Disaster Relief Appeal as well (our office is in Stockland - a shopping centre/mall for those out of the area). They have had trucks donated to go around & collect goods that are being donated to the people of Innisfail. The dock they are delivering to is right next to our office, and the trucks have been delivering full loads, constantly. It is amazing to watch. Fridges, freezers, ovens, dishwashers, sofas/lounges, cupboards, dressing tables, beds, mattresses, clothes, linen, household fittings (doors, sinks etc), toys for the kids, kitchen/cooking gear, food packages (non-perishible)... the list goes on and on. It is simply amazing, and heartwarming, and I cannot thank the people of Cairns enough for what they are donating to the people of Innisfail.

To be honest, the whole thing is really rattling me. It's been a long, long, very draining, roller-coaster of a week, only with not-so-high-highs.

"event","Cyclone Larry is on his way. At this point in time, he's a category 4 & he's expected to cross the coast at Innisfail (an hour south of here) at about 8am tomorrow morning. If the forecast is correct & he doesn't change course, we would be just getting the outer edges of his force, so we should be getting anywhere between 100-200km/hr winds tomorrow morning. However, cyclone's can be erratic and quite unpredictable, so he may change course & go away, or he could hit anywhere in the watch zone (anywhere in orange on the map on the link below).

go to:  <a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDQ65240.shtml"" title=""Bureau of Meterology, QLD."" target=""_blank"">the BOM's forecast track map</a> to see where I am in relation to Larry. I'm on the south side of Cairns, now. 

""Details of Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry, Category 4, for 10 pm AEST Sunday 
Central Pressure : 925 Hectopascals 
Location of Centre : within 20 kilometres of latitude 17.5 degrees south longitude 148.2 degrees east about 280 kilometres east of Innisfail 
Recent Movement : West at 25 kilometres per hour

Next advice from <a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/qld/forecasts.shtml"" title=""Bureau of Meterology, QLD."" target=""_blank"">the BOM</a> at 11pm. 


If we're getting ""destructive"" winds, as they are currently predicting, it's likely that we'll lose power at very least (strong wind + power lines + trees = no power). Also, we're expecting a storm surge, on top of king tides, so we'll probably flood as well. In which case, I probably won't be online for a while should we get any of this. 

Stay tuned. Wish me luck.  :)

Got a call from mum yesterday afternoon & she's telling me that she had told dad that she doesn't want to go back to him. Called dad after that & he's stunned, doesn't know what to do. Had a freaky set of dreams overnight, where both parents were throwing demons & beasts at me. I gather they we're both hoping I would help them fight their own fears. Called mum this morning, laid down the law to her - told her he's coming to see her & that she has to talk to him (36 years of marriage & they don't know how to communicate with each other. Gah!) All they have to do is be honest about what they each want, what they are willing to compromise on & then they can forge some sort of plan from there. So far, it seems like I rattled mum a bit when I jumped on her ass, but I think it might have had the right kind of effect. At least gotten her to a point where she's willing to talk & listen. That is the message I just got from dad anyway. Just spent an hour & a half on the phone with him... Gave him the same message about sitting, talking & listening, but gave it to him a fair bit gentler that I did with mum. I knew this morning that I would have to shock her to get her to listen to me, whereas dad was already at a point where he was vulnerable & would listen to me {or anyone, for that matter). We'll see how this goes. Apologies for bad grammer & hurredly written post. Stop. Sounds like a telegram. Stop.

init pretty?? 

In other news, things are going well with the boy, [he was sooo sweet the other night, I cooked for him, and oh god I'm such a girl around him..]. Work is going fine for me, not so great for others.. We're winding down for christmas, where I have two weeks off! Woo!! Am I looking forward to that? Hell yeah! Christmas eve will be with D's dad's family, then Christmas day will be spent with his mum's family. My parents will be down south, sister et al will be NZ, the rest of the family i really don't care about that much. I have an invite to Steve's parents place for X'mas, but D has already won that race. 

I have no idea what to get him though. What do you get the grinch as a gift for the holiday he dislikes the most?? Easter eggs? Maybe?

Mum has been going through some form of spiritual enlightenment journey. Hence I get 3-4hr phone calls while she tries to work out the stuff that I had to come to terms with when I was 14. woo. She's alright though. She'll get there I think.

There's more I could ramble about, but it's way too hot to think right now. 32.5C with 62% humidity at 4.30pm and I feel like crap. 

Just for the hell of it:

"event","I have been having nightmares. Rather, <em>a recurring</em> nightmare. I have not had this nightmare when at home alone. I have this nightmare on nights when I am with D, when I feel heightened emotional levels, or feel very close to him. As I see the dream, I am searching through a house, and as soon as I see the thing I am looking for (usually a small, ornate, solid gold treasure chest), this beast appears and begins chasing/hunting me. It does not want me to have <em>the thing</em>. 

I have had this nightmare explained by someone who knows (long story, irrelevant story, but I trust this person & their opinion) and this person believes that I am seeing the dream from D's perspective. It is D that is searching, and I am both <em>the beast</em> and <em>the thing.</em>

Bottom line is, I am stopping him from getting what he wants (me). Apparently, (I am told) I need to give <em>the thing</em> to him, but I am not sure that I am ready for that, and I am not certain that he knows what he is getting yet... 
Sometimes hideous things can be kept in beautiful little boxes... and sometimes hideous creatures can have the best of intentions at heart.

Am I nuts, or what?"

Care. Mark, I have tried to call, can't get through. Hope you're all ok and stuff. *hugs*

<strong>Mains.</strong>
Love. Hearing that someone other has been suffering for the last eight years with an issue similar to one I dealt with in 5 years, is giving me the wobbles. How dare they bring up their issues with no respect for the fact that I have only buried mine in a shallow grave, from which they could rise again to attack my senses and fling me from the stable ground I now stand on. Earthquakes are one thing, and this could be another, if I wasn't feeling so sure of my footing. He doesn't talk about <i>stuff</i> as I would like, but people are people, right? And all people are different, and part of me reminds me that I have to accept the differences, as I expect my differences to be accepted. Do unto others, etc, etc. But for the fact that I have a burning curiosity fed by desire (in short, I want to <i>know</i> this person), I have no problem with this thought. This curiosity is making me want to ask questions, but there is always the thought that maybe, just maybe, I don't want to know the answer, and things are better off being left unsaid. It's an internal issue, one which I am sure will resolve in due course. I just need to keep my head out of my heart, and I will be ok.

<strong>Desert.</strong>
Work. My days would be easier if others did their job properly, in short. With long days, and high numbers of people to deal with, provision of service gets difficult when the pieces around the edges aren't done as they should be done. Preparation weaves it's way into delivery, and people get bored, boredom breeds contempt, while they wait for me to do someone else's job before I can do mine. An issue which WILL (goddamnit) get resolved this week. I can't handle it any longer. It's difficult and draining enough to hold the reigns on 15-20 people when things are going well, but when the track is slippery and the car unserviced, it takes even more out of you to get to the finish line every day.

I'm exhausted, burning the candle, and starting to worry about things i shouldn't be worrying about."

so last night (being the day in question), woke up sick as the proverbial, work was crap, stream of phone calls after work, which almost made me late for dinner, which was excused by all, seeing as it was my birthday and all, went to dinner at D's place exhausted as all hell, ended up having a fabulous night, simply amazing food, catered for by 2 exquisitely talented chef's, waited on hand and foot by all 4 people present, some cuddles & canoodles, even a massage, went to sleep.. woke, got dropped off at work. crap day again.

"event","To be, or not to be, that is the question. If I were to commit a crime, I would hang my head in shame, but father, I am tempted. Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me into the deepening desire of carnal knowledge, of the forbidden fruit. Options are one thing, but the mystique of the known/unknown is leading me astray in the most ridiculous way. For I would if I could, but I'd love to, thanks for the offer. You know not what I mean, and this is surely a good thing, for knowledge is power, and power is irrevocably, undeniably going to be my downfall in such circumstances. Be that as it may, these things are sent to try me. And I shall try, but whether I try to deny, or try to achieve, THAT, father, is the question."

"event","As <lj user=""mookiemookie""> will tell you, I am in the land of the living, simply ridiculously busy, to the point of having little time to think things through, much less write about them.

But, tales and travels will show that I have been working, playing, and (not quite so much) sleeping. But I am living. Short updates on recent events:

I lost my mobile, and some guy called Robert who had it at one point, did not hand it is as he said he was going to. Around the same time, the computer went down. Me not having much time to spar, Steve took care of it. I know it's back, but I have no idea what was wrong with it. I bought a new phone. <a href=""http://au.motorola.com/pcs/v3/"" title=""I, Claudia."" target=""_blank"">This one.</a>  I have named her ""Claudia"". She has a new number to go with it. Relevant information will be emailed to those who need it.

I was naughty. I won't tell that story, just believe me when I say those three words. (Sorry, A.. ""Sorta naughty."")

I helped with k's surprise party for her parents. Bigger than Ben Hur, as they say. Worked my ass off, and yet still had a lot of fun at the same time. This was just this weekend, and yes, I'm still damn tired. 

I got head-hunted. Sort of. Well, it's still going on, really. He's calling me in a couple of weeks when he comes back north-bound again. Not sure how that's going to go. I'm not sure if he's offering something I want. I'm not sure if he's someone I want to work with, however, I will (at very least) listen to what he has to say.

People at work are weird. Some of them are brilliant, easy going, and as flexible as they come, yet others have difficulty understanding or working with flexibility, and are demanding and uncommunicative.

Despite that, I'm liking what I'm doing there.

Family are well, parents currently in NZ visiting my sister. Granddad is ok.. as well as can be expected.

Friends. Well. This is an interesting issue. Some friendships are going brilliantly, developing quite well, yet others seem to be continually getting stuck along the path, and others are expecting me to stick, when I don't, and it almost feels too demanding or possessive.. I don't enjoy that feeling. Oh well. I'm sure that will sort out at some point. I don't really feel like elaborating at the moment. I've lived through it enough lately.

All in all, things are fine."

"event","I've had to unplug myself for the last few weeks or however long it has been. Work & other things has taken up so much of my time, that there's precious little time for me. And time for me is defined as sleep time, generic relaxation (read ""lying on the sofa watching crap tv""), internet and girly things, like, doing my nails, and whatnot.	

But the things I have been doing, include: working, sleeping, having my mother stay with me for just over a week, going to Brisbane for a 4 day whirlwind, and getting to know the folk at work. So I am around, I have been reading lj, and I have been checking email, but there's not much else I have had the brain & energy for.

Brisbane was great. Catching up with Chrissy & Andy for those days was brilliant. Oh, and Ben was a nice boy, even if somewhat drunk. Not quite as drunk as his flatmates, Tim & Matt, but drunk all the same. Also caught up with <lj user=""niveau""> & <lj user=""amabile""> for drinks & coffee & shiny things (Myer). Go <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/amabile/122390.html"" title=""I'm lazy, she wrote it already  :)"" target=""_blank"">read </a> <lj user=""amabile"">'s version. It's true I tells ya! & thaniks to both of you for a very cool, pleasant afternoon. T'was good.

But I arrived home very tired, and I am still very tired. Today I actually slept in for the first time in... ohh.. two weeks or so... But sleeping in once, on top of two weeks or so of not getting *nearly* enough sleep is not good enough, I'm afraid. I still feel like crap. 

Anyway. I have more housework to catch up on. Smell ya later."

What Russian leader was not allowed to enter Disneyland when he visited America in 1959? 

It was Nikita Khrushev, who was dictator of Russia from 1953 to 1964. Khrushev's announced goal was to spread Communism throughout the world. He was described by journalists as shrewd, earthy, talkative and very energetic. He died on this day in 1971. 

WE WILL NEVER FORGET HOW WE DIDNT LET KHRUSHEV IN!"

"event","WOW...that is the only word that encompasses this experience.  This was by far the best movie viewing experience i have ever had the pleasure of being a part of.  I was the third person to show up and waited for over 3 hours to see this movie.  The line alone was amazing, there was laughter throughout the wait.  We frequently chanted ""SNAKES ON A PLANE"" everytime someone asked what we were seeing, or whenever we felt the need to be loud.  This one woman, feeling the need to be a bitch, walked by us and muttered ""its just a movie guys.""  She said that too close to the wrong person.  I was not having that kind of disrespect.  So when she walked back by, we all chanted loud and clear for all to hear...PWNED BITCH!  When we finally got in the theatre, someone had a cardboard cutout of Samuel L. Jackson and it was fantastic.  We used a plastic water jug as a beachball, and yelled a whores and bitches in the front row because they were drunk and being idiots.  Lucas came up with an amazing cheer ""What do we want?"" ""SNAKES"" ""Where do we want them?"" ""ON A PLANE"" ""Who do we love?"" ""SAMUEL L JACKSON"" ""When do we want it?"" ""NOW!""  when the movie started, the projector guy was fucking up big time, after all of the previews, and constantly shouting profanities in his general direction, He stopped the movie, fixed the problem, and we got to see more previews, including the TENACIOUS D movie! awesome...The movie was waaaaay better than i expected, words cannot describe how miraculous and divine this movie truly was...I am not going to see this movie again because it will not be the same at all, i never want to ruin this experience...goodnight everyone, watch out for snakes on planes...In the words of Samuel L Jackson...""I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THESE MOTHAFUCKIN SNAKES ON THIS MUTHAFUCKIN PLANE!"""

"event","So it was quite the show last night the common phrase is ""Feel Good Revolution Rocked the Rialto"" and i couldnt agree more, SOOOO many people showed up we were the loudest, most awesomest crowd any band had and i think thats awesome.&nbsp; That was the best show ive ever seen FGR play great job Tim, Alex, Max and Tommy you guys did great!!! Although 6th isnt the best you guys are #1 to me. I dont think the chick who won should have just because she dressed like a slut doesnt mean she should have won and Cosmic Slop got ripped off as well. Here are some pictures i took throughout the night! <br />

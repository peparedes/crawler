"event","Working full-time in retail, going to Grad school full-time, observing in high school, riding and showing to get to nationals next year, and studying for the praxis exam. This is my life as of late. Granted the praxis will be over with on Saturday, but still. I'm exhausted. I thought I'd be able to do it fairly stress-free, but it's catching up with me a bit. I mean, I'll get it done and I'll do as good a job as I can with everything, but man I can't wait for it all to be over with. 

It would be really awesome if I could go back to part time, but 1) there's no one I trust enough to take my full-time position at the store and 2) I need the money! I must move out! I didn't even have enough to move out BEFORE I got into school, so how am I going to do it AND pay for school? At least my parents are going halfsies with me on tuition and I've qualified for a loan. I&nbsp;really shouldn't be whining.

I also need a vacation in the worst way. I can't remember the last time I had more than two days off in a row from the store. I think it was back in the middle of May. Which also happens to be the last time I saw Ben. Clearly, this is a problem. I was going to rendevous with him in Florida in October to do all the Disney Halloween stuff, but then I&nbsp;got accepted into school and my Ben plans went right out the door. I think I'm going to have to wait until winter break from school. BLAH! Of course, that's also going to be the busiest time at the store, but by that time I won't care about the damn store. 

Sorry this was such a whiny entry. It's really not a big deal and I'll be fine. I'm just feeling stretched in all directions at the moment and needed to whine a bit.

"event","I&nbsp;got my classes today! I'll be taking three classes every monday night from 5:30-8, then five saturdays during the semester from 8-4 (ew). I'll also have to be placed in a school and do 35 hours of field work. This is an excelerrated program and I hope it's not too scary and intense. Pretty much: I&nbsp;hope I&nbsp;can keep up! 

I also got my student ID which makes me feel more legitimate. AND I bought notebooks today!!! I LOVE&nbsp;NOTEBOOKS!!! I&nbsp;don't know why, but they are my favorite school supply ever! I almost lost it when I&nbsp;got to the notebook aisle in Staples. I&nbsp;almost squeed out loud. It was a fantastic time.

Oh, and I&nbsp;already have an assignment for school. I had to pick a topic and write a reflection paper to share with the class. I&nbsp;picked one that said something along the lines of writing about a memorable teacher from school (positive or negative) and how he/she influenced me as a student. That was an easy one. I'm totally going to write about dear Mr. Peacock! I&nbsp;can do negative (freshman year when he scared the bejeezus out of me) and positive (senior year when I&nbsp;realized that he was totally amazing and made me want to be an English teacher). I&nbsp;knew he'd come in handy one of these days!

"event","At last I have something to aim for in my life again. I&nbsp;got into the Masters of Arts in Teaching program at Bellarmine! I will be studying to become a high school English teacher. While my time off after college was nice it will be nice to have something to work for...a purpose. It's like I've just been floating around for a while, taking up space and not being a productive member of society. Like I&nbsp;said: it was nice, but it's gotten old. 

The best news that has come out of all of this is: I DON'T EVER&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;TAKE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;DAMNED&nbsp;GRE&nbsp;EVER&nbsp;AGAIN!!!!!

In other news, I ordered a nerdy shirt online. I am so excited about it and can't wait until it gets here. It's a Team Bill shirt! I just squeal every time I think of it! Finally, I can express my love to everyone! Haha I'm so sad.&nbsp;

I don't know when I'm going to get to see Ben again. I&nbsp;miss him terribly. Sure, we talk on the phone and on xbox fairly often, but it's not the same. I&nbsp;was going to make a trip to Florida in October to see him while he's on vacation from the Bahamas. But, now that I got into grad school I doubt I'd be able to miss any classes. So, that would mean waiting until a break from school, but if I&nbsp;have to wait that long I think I&nbsp;may explode or lose my mind. But, I will survive and then may explode or lose my mind when I&nbsp;do actually get to see him again. Either way the same thing will happen. Ha!

Time to go to bed for another round of &quot;same stuff, different day,&quot; but not for long!"

"event","Less than a week before I&nbsp;go to Ohio!!! These next few days may be the longest ever! For some reason I am, like overly excited to see Ben. I don't think I&nbsp;was this excited at Christmas time even. It's like I've got butterflies and everything. Maybe it's because it was such short notice and I&nbsp;had the Christmas visit planned ahead of time. I don't know, but I'm going crazy...I&nbsp;feel like I'm going to explode! 

Therefore, I am extra cheerful these days, which is good...especially when working in retail. 

OMG! Another thing for me to be cheerful about is that from March 11th through March 15th I&nbsp;will be in New York with my mother watching the Big East Basketball Tournament! But, not only that....my mom won this thing where....we get to travel with the team and stay in their hotel! Dude. It's crazy I tell you, just crazy. Of course I'm having all of these fantasies about becoming best friends with the whole team and hanging out with them all the time, but I&nbsp;know that's not going to happen. Still though, if we get to talk that will be cool. And even if we barely see the team at least I'll be in New York chillin with my mom, eating pastrami sadwiches, going to central park, going into super fancy stores pretending like I&nbsp;belong, and watching basketball games. Amazing! 

Yeah, I thought I had a lot more to say, but I guess not. Things are good with me and&nbsp;I hope they are for YOU as well!&nbsp;"

The week in September without power was nothing compared to a few days without it now. It was so incredibly cold. I could see my breath INSIDE my house. Not cool.

So, hooray for the sweet, sweet electrical juice that is flowing once again.</p><p>However, my parents still don't have power, so they're living with me for the moment, which is kind of a drag, but what am I gonna do?

But, whatever...I love them and all so it's just fine.</p><p>Not much else has been going on with me. Just working and riding really.

So, I&nbsp;decided to make Ben and his family cookies for Christmas. I&nbsp;made four different kinds that I&nbsp;had never made before and they all turned out really well, but it took forever! Anyhow, I'm looking forward to giving them away.

"event","I got this from Kate:<br /><br />MEME TIME: Comment and I'll give you a letter. Then you have to list ten things you LOVE that begin with that letter. Afterward, post this in your journal and give out some letters of your own.<br /><br />My letter was <strong>B.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Boys</strong>: Any boys and all boys...even ficticious boys!&nbsp; There is something I&nbsp;find so endearing about boys that I can't fully explain.&nbsp; I connect to them better than girls and I feel that they're a lot less trouble than girls.&nbsp; I obviously LOVE and need my girl friends, but there's nothing like hanging out with a couple of guys.&nbsp; Sometimes girls get too serious or wound up about stuff, so it's nice to be with guys who are as laidback as I am.&nbsp; And when I'm stressed or on edge boys help me calm down.<br /><br /><strong>2.&nbsp; Baking:&nbsp; </strong>I love how I go from boys to baking. Anyway, baking is fun and you get (hopefully) delicious results!&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>3. Books:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>There's nothing like a good book to lose yourself in.&nbsp; I love the way books feel; I&nbsp;love the way they sound when you knock on the cover or open them; I love the way they smell.&nbsp; Although I admit they're kind of cool, I am against devices like the Kindle.&nbsp; Holding the book, feeling the book, smelling the book, physically turning the pages of a book are just as much apart of reading as what's on the inside.&nbsp; With electronic books, we're losing that I find that very sad.&nbsp; Plus the name Kindle makes me think of book burning and that is not OK.<br /><br /><strong>4.&nbsp; Basketball (college men's):&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>I absolutely adore watching Men's college&nbsp;basketball.&nbsp; It's exciting and face-paced.&nbsp; I also like the players and I&nbsp;always hope they do well.&nbsp; I love it when the camera&nbsp;shows the bench and the players are linking arms or are jumping up and down cheering their teammates on.&nbsp; But it also breaks my heart when the guys on the bench know they've lost the game and&nbsp;are crying or have their heads down in defeat.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what team&nbsp;they're on (except for UK because&nbsp;it's the players' fault&nbsp;they chose a crap basketball program to be involved&nbsp;with) because they're all doing what they love and in college it's not for the&nbsp;money or fame, but because they love the game and&nbsp;love their teammates, fans, and coaches and I think that that is just great! P.S. I have&nbsp;absolutely nothing against Women's college basketball...my family has season tickets&nbsp;to&nbsp;UofL's women and I've been to my share of games, but I don't find it as exciting.<br /><br /><strong>5. Bed:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>I'm a big fan of sleeping and snuggling in a super comfy bed.<br /><br /><strong>6.&nbsp;The Barn:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>My passion in life is horseback riding.&nbsp; I've been riding for about 14 years and a good portion of my life has been spent in and around horse barns.&nbsp; The barn I am referring to here is my current stable, Stonehurst Riding Club.&nbsp; I've been there for about 7 or 8 years and I've learned the most there, made great friends, bought my first horse from there, and have really grown as a rider.&nbsp; It's a place that makes me happy and it's someplace I'll always love.<br /><br /><strong>7.&nbsp; Blasting the radio and singing along:&nbsp; </strong>I can't sing.&nbsp; So, it's great to pretend that I&nbsp;can!&nbsp; This activity is done mostly in my car.&nbsp; I often make a fist and pretend that I have a microphone...it is awesome.<br /><br /><strong>8.&nbsp; Badly drawn animals:&nbsp; </strong>Haha...who doesn't love a really messed up looking sheep?&nbsp; My &quot;wheelie horse&quot; is a classic as is Kate's triangle-footed sheep complete with movement lines.&nbsp; These are fun to share with friends and laugh about.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>9.&nbsp; Bangkok and Britain:&nbsp; </strong>These were two of my most memorable and enjoyable trips, but this number on the list is really about travel in general.&nbsp; I have learned more from traveling than I have in any classroom.&nbsp; It has allowed me to become more open-minded and cultured.&nbsp; Plus, traveling is just plain fun!<br /><br /><strong>10.&nbsp;Blank notebooks:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>My favorite back-to-school item was always notebooks.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to fill the pages with notes, homework, and doodles.&nbsp; I still greatly enjoy blank notebooks because they're kind of like books, but I get to be the one to fill them.&nbsp; I like looking at the lines and thinking about all the words and letters they'll hold. <br /><br />OK, that was fun.&nbsp; In other news, I&nbsp;haven't posted in a really long time.&nbsp; I've been working at the new Jo-Ann Fabrics store in Shelbyville Plaza.&nbsp; We open on Friday, so in the meantime we've set the entire store.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean we got there and it was just empty.&nbsp; We had to put all the pegs in the walls in the certain order they go in that matches the other Jo-Ann stores. We had to put up the shelving as well.&nbsp; We were doing that a good long time before we got any stock.&nbsp; For the past month or so we've been putting all the stock away.&nbsp; We also have a confusing and crowded Christmas section that doesn't have a certain way it's supposed to look.&nbsp; So, that's where I've been the past two weeks...trying to get everything (you would not believe the amount of seasonal stock we have) to fit.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hung ornaments for about 8 hours today...yeah. But, I also got to decorate the display trees, so that was fun!&nbsp; Anyway, I've been busy working is my point. WE&nbsp;OPEN&nbsp;ON&nbsp;FRIDAY&nbsp;SO&nbsp;COME&nbsp;AND&nbsp;CHECK&nbsp;IT&nbsp;OUT&nbsp;SOMETIME&nbsp;IF&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;CAN! Oh, so check out these next few weekends:<br />--This weekend is soft opening. This means that we open our doors, but we don't advertise it. This will still be a big day because we have A&nbsp;LOT of people who knock on the door to see if we're open despite the HUGE sign out front that says we open on the 14th.&nbsp; People have even come in with shopping carts all ready to go! <br />--The weekend after that is the Grand Opening. This will be heavily advertised and we will get an insane amount of people.<br />--The weekend after the Grand Opening is the day after Thanksgiving.......shoot me now.<br />Yeah, so busy, busy, busy.<br /><br />I've also been busy riding getting ready for Sport Horse Nationals next September. I know it sounds like a long time away, and it is, but this is a national event so I don't think preparing a year in advance is too early.&nbsp;If I'm going to spend the money (and trust me it's a lot) then by God I'm going to come home with a national championship! That is the ultimate goal.<br /><br />Other than those things I haven't been doing too much...there's not time for anything else!<br /><br />Ben is in the Bahamas and he calls about once a week, which is nice, but I miss him terribly. He is coming home for Christmas, but I'll probably be working like crazy. I hope my schedule works out so I&nbsp;can spend some time with him.<br /><br />OK, my hands are freezing! And this is long enough.<br />"

Some girls from the barn and I&nbsp;went on a trail ride yesterday at Long Run Park! It was very fun and all of the horses were well behaved...even Manly!&nbsp;It was a gorgeous day too which made it that much better. It's fun to leave the farm sometimes and just ride for fun. We weren't riding to get ready for a show, there was no pressure, we weren't being critiqued or anything, we were riding because it's something we all love to do. 

I&nbsp;went to the Field of Screams on Saturday. It was so much fun! I&nbsp;was so scared in the beginning because it was my first haunted thing of the year, but I&nbsp;got warmed up and it was just fun. It's supposed to be this really involved maze that may take you hours to get through (and unlike other mazes this one has scary stuff all through it), but thanks to the wind storm it all got ruined. This year there was a set path to follow, but it was still fun and scary. So, we went through the maze part and then you wait in another short line to go into the barn. This was the scariest part because there weren't any breaks from getting scared. There was a section where you had to crawl and a hallway where there were two loooong airbags on each side and you had to squeeze through them. That was scary because it was so claustrophobic and it was totally dark and you didn't know how long it was going to be. I&nbsp;got scared pretty good a couple of times because the &quot;haunts&quot; caught me off guard when I&nbsp;wasn't paying attention. Like at this one part I&nbsp;was talking to the people behind me and when I&nbsp;turned around there was this creepy-ass person with white contacts like right in my face. Haha...that was a good one. Really the best part about the Field of Screams was that it was so long! I'm not sure exactly how long it took us, but it was definitely in the 45 minute range, which is probably the longest haunted house I've been to. There weren't any animatronics I don't think, and a few scenes, but mostly it was just the actors and now that I&nbsp;think about it they all did a damn good job because there really wasn't much else besides them. So, I&nbsp;don't know how &quot;scary&quot;&nbsp;it was, but it was great for other reasons. 

I've got some friends coming down from Ohio this weekend, so hopefully I'll get to go to some more haunted attractions with them! So, Kate: You all save some good ones to do with me!"

"event","<br />I&nbsp;am waiting around for Spanish class to start and, surprisingly, I&nbsp;don't really feel like taking a&nbsp;nap. The rainy weather energizes me some. However, I also&nbsp;believe that rainy weather is the best napping weather...therefore, I think I&nbsp;am confused. The point is&nbsp;that while I would usually be sleeping on the floor of my dad's office, I am not.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I definitely forgot to talk about my visit with Ben last post...oops. At least I think I&nbsp;forgot.&nbsp;Anyway, as&nbsp;with every visit, it was too short. I&nbsp;got there&nbsp;at about 8pm on Friday and his flight&nbsp;was at 6am Sunday. We managed to see two movies <em>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist</em>, which I&nbsp;liked better than I thought I would even though Michael Cera played the same character he always does, and<em> How to Lose friends and Alientate People</em>, which I didn't like as much as I&nbsp;thought I would though it had its moments. We pretty much just chilled and didn't do a whole lot of anything, which was fine. It was, obviously, a little sad. I told him I wouldn't cry, but that last hug at the airport was a killer. I mean, I didn't bawl or anything, just a few tears and some sniffles is all. I tried to hold it in, but couldn't. His phone doesn't work down there and his dad set up something on his, but it's super expensive to call the states, so I won't get to talk to him much either. I guess not seeing each other a whole lot anyway was good practice, since it's not really bothering me yet. I&nbsp;mean, I&nbsp;can just pretend he's still in Florida or something.<br /><br />Day two at the job was pretty much the same as day one. I'm setting up the food decorating/food craft section, so it's kind of fun. We don't have the product yet, but I know what we're going to have since it's written on the little scanning stickers on the pegs and shelves. Man, do I&nbsp;ever have a new-found respect and appreciation for the employees who set up, say, a Wal-Mart or a Target. Every 8 foot section has to be configured a certain way and the pegs have to be in the right places and the shelves have to be a certain number of notches down, etc. And some of those peg/shelf configurations are complex.&nbsp; The pegs are not just on there row by row...all the product is shaped differently, some&nbsp;areas of the 8&nbsp;foot section&nbsp;are bunched together (like the sprinkle section) because they're small and then on the same&nbsp;8 foot&nbsp;board you'll have rolling pins and stuff, which are long and need to&nbsp;be spread out.&nbsp;It's fairly tedious and often annoying. Anyway, the food craft section has about 88 feet of aisle space, so it took quite some doing...I&nbsp;think there are only two or three sections left. But, it'll be totally fun when there's product on the shelves! Lots of icing and sprinkles and cake-decorating things. We have cupcake decorating stuff and chocolate molds and pretzel dippers. It's going to be the best section...obviously. Especially since I put it all together! <br /><br />So yeah, I&nbsp;guess that's it for now. I've babbled on and on about nothing for too long. <br /><br />Oh, I'm getting Season 11 of the SImpsons right after class! Yay!"

I don't get to leave until later, but as long as I get there it'll be a-OK.

We start working next week, but it'll be helping to finish setting the store up...we won't even be getting the merchandise for at least two more weeks. So, I think Monday will be starting lighting fixtures...fun. But, at least we don't have to follow the dress code yet. Not that it's tough or anything, but we can still wear jeans for a while. So, yeah, the orientation was long and not the most thrilling. We watched some pretty &quot;amazing&quot; training videos...I'm sure you can imagine. I'm only worried about the cutting counter because my measuring skills are not the best. Anyway, woo new job.

Speaking of which, I'm so nervous everytime I check my e-mail because I want to know what the people at Presbyterian Publishing Corporation think of the stuff I sent them. I only sent it on Monday, so I&nbsp;know they won't tell me for a while yet, but I&nbsp;wanna know soon!

Well, I&nbsp;don't really care what they publish because I would be a copywriter and would write stuff for the internet, brochures, and other promotional items, and I&nbsp;would get to edit like crazy, which is great. Soooo, hopefully all will go well! 

Meanwhile, I'm totally nervous about this UofL/UConn game...we just need to hold on a little longer! Ugh...my heart can't take the ups and downs of UofL football! 

Oh! Cool news...a lady that went to China with my dad and me is going back for about 5 months. Well, she lives just a block away and asked if I'd house-sit for her. Regardless of whether I&nbsp;get paid or not, I would live there full-time and be able to kind of move out of my parents' house for a while...and for free (which is obviously the best part)! Plus, she has a cat and said I&nbsp;could bring Pepper over there too! This could turn out to be a really sweet deal! 

Also, Ben is officially leaving for the Bahamas on October 5th. That is sad, but he's coming back home that weekend, so I&nbsp;will hopefully get to see him one last time before he leaves. However, I&nbsp;have orientation for this job I'm taking (until I&nbsp;find a real job) that Thursday and I'm hoping they won't want me to work that same weekend. I&nbsp;hope it all works out!!! 

It seems like I'm doing a lot of hoping lately doesn't it? Well, I&nbsp;am!&nbsp; There are things going on that are up in the air right now and I'm not sure how any of them are going to turn out! So, I'm hopeful and nervous and just a tiny bit anxious about everything. If UofL wins this game that would help my nerves out a lot! 

Gah! It's 20-21 UofL! I&nbsp;can't take it! That's too close for comfort!

Well, we lost...the good news is that I successfully recorded the presidential debate (I&nbsp;wasn't sure I&nbsp;did it right). I'll have to watch that later."

It gets a little boring sometimes, but what're you gonna do? Haha...my mom and I actually resorted to playing freakin charades one night...wow, that was desperation right there. Last night we played Scrabble, which was fun. There wasn't any damage to the house or anything, but down the street, near Atherton H.S., there's a huge tree blocking the road and it hasn't been cleared yet because when it fell it knocked over live wires and those wires were shooting off sparks and flames, so they turned the power off. In other words, we won't be getting power for a while until they clear all that mess up. But yeah, we cleared out the fridge yesterday and are using coolers and bags of ice. But seriously, it's pretty much life as always.

Meanwhile, I'm taking a Spanish class at JCC! Spanish is just so useful and I&nbsp;have been wanting to take it, so why not now? My dad's head of the language department, so it's free, which is another reason to just go ahead and take the class. I'm in 101, but I'm not taking it from my dad. I'm actually taking it with the lady who headed that France trip earlier this summer. So, I&nbsp;took French all throughout school and now when I'm taking Spanish, it's with a French person as a professor! Haha. But, so far it's fun and pretty easy thanks to French. But, I'm having a hard time getting French to move out of the way and I'm always thinking in French in class and pronouncing Spanish like French and then I&nbsp;get all confused. Haha...oh, language.&nbsp;

So, that's where I&nbsp;am now...Dad's office at JCC. It's nice&nbsp;because we can carpool and my class isn't until 10:30, so I&nbsp;can take a nap in&nbsp;his office! Speaking of which...it's about that time!

I saw Batman the other night...OMG it was amazing!!! 

The new Offspring CD is also AMAZING!!! I put it on as soon as I got in my car in the parking lot and was grinning like a lunatic all the way home because it was so great! It may be my favorite of their albums, which is an awfully hefty order. Anyway, I've been listening to it non-stop for about three days and it just gets better and better!

Also, there's a small window of hope that I'll get to see Ben before he goes to the Bahamas. It all depends on when they send him down there. Before he goes he's going to take a week off of work to go see his family up in Ohio...so, if he doesn't leave for three or so more weeks then I'll get to drive up and see him in Ohio! I hope it's not before, because I'll still be in New Mexico. So, we'll see what happens and hopefully things will work out.

I had so much fun, got great practice, and met some awesome new people I can hang out with in Louisville! I have an insane amount of pictures that I wil probably just put on facebook, since that's the easiest. So, look for those in the near future! Along with that will be commentary about the trip, since it would be ridiculous to type about it without pictures to explain.&nbsp;<br /><br />And although I just got back home, I'm leaving again on Monday night to spend about two weeks in New Mexico.&nbsp;It's Youth Nationals (horsey stuff) and I'm going to help.

WHAT!!?? I didn't even know they were in the studio! So, after my jaw appointment that's the first order of business. GAH! I can't believe I didn't hear a word about it! I'm so excited to get it though!<br /><br />I got my kitty back yesterday! She didn't forget about me and has been following me everywhere and being all lovey! SO cute!&nbsp;<br /><br />Alas, despite all this good stuff I'm pretty sad. Ben also told me that the company he works for is sending him to the Bahamas. He could leave anytime from Monday to August 1st and he could be down there anywhere from 6 months to TWO YEARS. I cried, but tried to keep it together since I was still on the phone. God. I'm sure there will be more on this later...<br /><br />I'm going to buy tickets online to see <em>The Dark Knight</em> tonight. Of course, Ben already saw it and (as expected) he said it was amazing. Although I was a little more excited before I learned about the Bahamas, I am obviously still looking forward to it.

"event","&nbsp;So, the cat knocked over a vase of water onto my laptop a few days ago.&nbsp; I let it dry and used the hairdryer, but it still wasn't turning on, so I took it to the shop.&nbsp; The good news (the guy told me) is that there shouldn't be any damage to the hard drive and that he's pretty sure I wouldn't lose anything.&nbsp; So, he suggested I get an external hard drive (which I had been thinking about getting anyway) and the worst would be that I'd have to get a new computer.&nbsp; He also said he wouldn't charge me anything at first, so I thought that was pretty sweet.&nbsp; He'll call in a few days and then I'll know what's up.&nbsp; I tried to be mad at the cat, but I just couldn't do it!&nbsp; She's much too cute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Speaking of the cat, she's recovering very well from her spaying surgery.&nbsp; I wasn't sure exactly what they did to females and I found out that they completely remove the ovaries and the uterus.&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; Luckily, her personality hasn't changed and she's still the same curious, friendly, in-your-face cat that she was before.&nbsp; Haha...I wasn't around for it, but apparently she hissed at my dad the other day.&nbsp; We hung one of her toys from the fridge door and she got her leg tangled in it, but when my dad went to help her she hissed at him.&nbsp; She was probably scared and then I'm sure he came along in a loud kind of way and scared her even more, but I thought it was pretty funny.&nbsp; Anyway, she's doing great and was having quite a time watching the squirrels in the yard today.

Unfortunately, I'm kind of sick.&nbsp; I woke up yesterday with my throat burning and my body aching like crazy.&nbsp; My joints and muscles were sore.&nbsp; I went out to the barn anyway (bad idea) and tried to ride, but it hurt pretty badly, especially the canter, which killed my hip joints.&nbsp; I came back home and felt worse than ever that night.&nbsp; I had a temp of 101, which I rarely get.&nbsp; My body felt a little better today, but&nbsp;my throat was the same.&nbsp; I went to my mom's office and got a strep test.&nbsp; It came back negative, so I got a blood count.&nbsp; My white blood cell count was borderline for a bacterial thing, but unless I get worse we're assuming it's something viral.

I hope I get better very soon because on Sunday I'm going to Florida for eight days to see Ben!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; I'm so excited!&nbsp; I haven't seen him since spring break.&nbsp; Clearly, being sick while down there is not an option.

I'm kind of bored, but I don't feel well enough to really do anything.&nbsp; This is a dilemma."

"event","I am finally done with that dumb paper! I suppose it turned out all right. I may have repeated myself a whole bunch, but the ending was actually kind of interesting and I think it made sense and was a point that goes against what most people think, so that's always good, yeah? Whatever, I don't want to think about it anymore. My head and brain hurt, like really. It's not a headache, but my whole head just feels tired and heavy and worn out. It's like a muscle that's been working hard and now that it's done working it can't relax, so it's all stiff and weird feeling. Yeah, that's my brain. I stayed up ridiculously late last night (until 4:30 at least) re-designing my instructions. I really didn't even know it was that late. I was on a roll, so I just kept going. I woke up at 10 to finish my user test report for the instructions and print out the instructions. I spent a while cutting them out too since I made them be on 5"" by 5"" paper and printed them on 81/2 by 11 and wanted them to be straight and all the same size. It took longer than you might think. Plus, I get a little OCD about that kind of thing, so I had to make sure it was pretty perfect. 

Anyway, I still have a lot of stuff to do this weekend, which is kind of a downer and makes my brain more tired. At least it's a lot of littler things, so it's not as daunting as a paper. 

I'm sorry to keep rambling on about boring school but, well, it's my life at the moment and unfortunately there just ain't anything else to talk about!

I'm exhausted...1am bedtime? Way better than I thought it would be."

"event","I met my goal for my paper for today. I have 2 non-double spaced pages complete. This is 4 double spaced pages, which leaves me with 3 more double spaced pages to go, which translates to only 1 and a half non-double spaced pages! I'm over half-way finished! Once I got going it didn't take long. I rambled a lot though, but I do makes points somewhere in between all the bullshit and repetition. The last page and half are going to at least be fairly interesting (I hope) as I'll relate the courtroom scene in <i>Merchant of Venice</i> to how Shakespeare may have felt about the English laws at the time.&nbsp; I'm going to pull some info from an Elizabeth I paper I wrote two years ago. Hopefully it will work out and I won't have to stretch the last part toooo much. Anyway, I'm through with thinking about that dumb paper for now. <br /><br />Off to adding pictures to my instructions! &lt;----sarcastic exclamation mark.&nbsp; It's not hard, but it's frustrating and tedious. I've got to resize the pictures, but if they still aren't fitting then I have to re-arrange the words and that always means something else has to be re-arranged so it fits back together and blah, blah, blah. I actually have ambitious plans for this project, but I don't know if I'll have time to see them through. At least I can have the TV on in the background while I do this.<br /><br />Plus, I canceled my riding lesson for tomorrow so I could have more time to do everything. That already made me feel better. I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel, but not quite yet."

But, before we get to that let us dwell (briefly) on this past weekend. It was Kate's boyfriend's birthday, so I went out to dinner with them and some of their friends. Ben is like Brandon's brother (from another), so Brandon was all disappointed that Ben wouldn't be able to come up to Ohio for his birthday. I was sad about that too. So, I go meet everyone for dinner and who do I see sitting at the table? BEN! It was pretty much the best thing ever. I had called him not too long ago either and he made it seem like he was still in Florida. So, that was an amazingly wonderful surprise. So, we obviously hung out the rest of the weekend and it was great. The best part is, I get to see him again in two weeks and spend spring break down in Florida! 

...If I survive that long. I'm so incredibly stressed out. I have a group presentation and a huge mid-term paper due on the same day (this Thursday). I have the final draft of my instructions project and a first draft of the user test report due on Wednesday. That may not sound that impossible to handle, but they're all due so close together that it's making it extra difficult. Then, there's the usual homework and reading for those and other classes, but that's all on hold until these three main things are taken care of. It's probably going to be an awful paper because 1) I'm not at all interested in writing it and 2) I just don't care that much anymore. I'm a senior, I'm graduating soon, and will be whether I get an A or a C on this paper. We'll see (""C"" haha) what happens. I will obviously not aim for a C, but it's not like this is going to be a stellar paper. 

I wish this week was over. I wish it was spring break. I wish I didn't have to write this paper. I wish I had more time. Alas, wishing does not make it so. 

I used to like and enjoy Shakespeare, but now I think he's kind of a bastard. A genius, yes, but still a bastard. See, you can't spell bastard without bard. Clearly, there is a conspiracy here. And clearly, I need to shut up and start doing something productive."

Then, I got an e-mail saying that my last class, Children's Lit, is being canceled today because my professor is sick.&nbsp; So, my long day of four classes turned out to only be two classes! I'm pretty happy with that arrangement. 

I'm going to kick boxing with Morgan later tonight. She's been going to this place for years and I'm kind of surprised I haven't gone with her until now. Should be fun! Plus, I've been feeling really guilty. I haven't been to the rec in ages.

A little bit ago Kate and I were sitting in the living room when we were hit with an awful skunk smell. Morgan came out of her room, which is attached to the living room and said the smell woke her up. I opened the front door and it was stronger than ever. We looked for tracks in the snow and saw some that looked like a possibility, but we never saw the actual animal. Ugh, but the smell just hovered in the living room for a while. It's better now and thank goodness it's raining because that knocked out the smell pretty quickly. Good thing it wasn't in the basement or something! 

We just had an extremely goofy moment in the kitchen. It cannot even be described, but just know that it was awesomely silly."

In more exciting news, my spring break plans are pretty cemented. I'll be spending my spring break in Florida with Ben! He's driving up to Ohio the first weekend of spring break because he has a wedding to go to. Then, I'm going to drive back down to Florida with him (18 hours...yikes! but, I bet it'll be fun), spend the week down there, fly back to Louisville on Sat, spend Easter with the family, then come back to Ohio. I bought my plane ticket yesterday and I'm so excited! These next few weeks until spring break are going to be killer. I will have A LOT of school stuff to do before then so I guess that'll keep me busy. 

Lessons were canceled today since everything is still covered in snow and icy. This is fine with me as I can get caught up on work. Which, I guess I should get started on."

I have the house to myself for a while. Morgan is visiting her boyfriend and Kate is out with her boyfriend. I was really bored for a while, but I've decided to start over on Grey's Anatomy. I'm on the fourth episode. I haven't been keeping up with it and although it's not a big deal, I kind of miss it and want to know what's going on. But, I need to get caught up again. 

I wish I had a friend like George. Well, before he got all messed up and complicated. 

Grocery shopping and buying a broom are on the list for tomorrow. 

Hm, I'm getting kind of bored again. I wanted a coloring book but, to my dismay, I didn't bring any. Apparently, I will also need to buy a coloring book at the grocery store. 

This show makes me want to be a surgeon, but I know it's obviously not like that in real life and I would probably hate it. Plus, knowing my fabulous relationship with science, I would probably kill everyone.

Nothing big happened, but a lot of little things made it nice.<br /><br />It wasn't bitterly cold for once and my car finally started!<br /><br />We had regular riding lessons for the first time this semester. I had to ride this horse that I love to hate, Kyle. I'm sure I've mentioned him before. But, we actually had a really nice ride. My coach said, ""I know he's not your favorite, but in this lesson you're going to be schooling him for lower level riders to ride him later in the week."" So, that made me feel really good and I did feel like I rode him well and helped him out. I even got him round in the end, which I never thought would ever happen on that horse. It was amazing, trust me.<br /><br />The shower stayed warm.<br /><br />I drove to the library and did a sweet parallel parking job that was perfect on the first try. I went to the library to watch a film version of <i>The Taming of the Shrew </i>for my Shakespeare class. It wasn't the most exciting thing, but I'm glad I got a copy to watch, since everyone in our class had to watch it. <br /><br />I went to the grocery store to get cream cheese so Morgan could make her amazing chip dip. It was quite delicious. That chip dip is always a nice treat. <br /><br />I watched the UofL vs. UConn game, which was the only downer of the day. We only lost by two points though. Losing by a little bit is both good and bad. I mean, I'm glad we made it interesting, but we were so close! We'll still be second in the Big East though.<br /><br />I got a good amount of work done.<br /><br />My poetry class was canceled for the whole week, which means no classes at all for me on Monday and Wednesday! or Friday, but that's normal.<br /><br />I have a list of 29 disturbing movies that I can't wait to start watching!<br /><br />I went to the REC yesterday to do Step and Sculpt, which made me feel good. I've got to get back into doing that at least twice a week in addition to riding. <br /><br />So, I'm definitely feeling pretty content with things right now. I just wish it was a little earlier because I'm not tired, but I have to get up early for a long day."

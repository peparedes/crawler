"event","Lots of things going on in my life. You know how sometimes God uses hard times to make you aware of just how selfish and proud and self-sufficient you are? Yeah, well, that's where I am right now. But as I've read through Job, I've been reminded that the suffering God allows us to go through is such a paradoxical demonstration of His love. It shows us that we need Him. And if we didn't realize how much we need Him, we would never know the blessedness of being totally dependent on Him.

Lord, I know You see this fear in my heart
of what my future holds.
I feel You softly ask if I can trust You more
and give you control.
So I kneel before You now and I offer everything.
Come and be the Lord of all--all I am or ever hope to be.

I surrender. I surrender to the One who loves me more than life.
I surrender. I surrender. Here is my heart. I open it wide.
To the one who cannot be unfaithful I now offer You all that I am.
I surrender. I surrender. From this day on, I'll be in Your hands.

I've been living for myself and now I want to live for You alone.
Come and help me when I'm weak and when my path seems so unknown.
You will be beside me still. I know You want what's best for me.
So when I want to take control, Lord, please come and help my unbelief.

I surrender. I surrender to the One who loves me more than life.
I surrender. I surrender. Here is my heart. I open it wide.
To the one who cannot be unfaithful I now offer You all that I am.
I surrender. I surrender. From this day on, I'll be in Your hands.

If you think of me, please pray that I would cling to Him."

"event","I've been putting a lot of thought into getting involved the
LiveJournal world again. A lot of the reason I switched to Xanga is
because I get annoyed with the way LiveJournal works. But I'm going to
come back again--at least for awhile, for a couple of reasons. 1) I've
been missing some of my friends that only use LJ. 2) I have some things
I need to get out, and Xanga is not the place to do it. I've been
thinking through a lot of things and learning a lot, and I feel the
need to express it, but I don't feel like it would be wise to be that
open on Xanga since so many people access my Xanga blog. So anyway,
just to let you know what's going on....<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Most likely I will protect my posts
here and make them friends only. If you want to read my posts, you're
going to have to respond to this post. Anyone who doesn't respond will
be removed from my friends list.<br>
<br>
</span>And just so you're prepared for what's coming, I
really do plan on using my LJ as a place to bare my soul, to some
extent. I feel like there are some things I need to sort out and won't
be able to unless I share them. So bear with me, please. I'm really not
looking for your criticism. I'm going to be transparent here. I want to
make sure everyone knows a lot of the things I want to say are things
I'm still sorting out myself, and I don't claim to necessarily be
right. I just want to try to sort through some of my confusion by
writing it out. I do welcome your input, though. <br>
<br>
The main thing I want to talk about is the issue of love. I turn 23 tomorrow <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(happy birthday to me!)</span>
and, to be perfectly honest, I never thought I would still be single at
23. In some ways I am at peace with it. I know God is doing the best
for me. But at the same time, I'm lonely. And it hurts to see friends
all around me, most of them younger than I, getting together and
getting married. There are all kinds of emotions that well up inside of
me. And because of my nature, I have to get them out. That's what I
want to do here. I have so many questions about love, and I want to
understand as much as I can. Some of the questions I have I want to
discuss on here the next few posts, such as:<br>
<br>
-How do I reconcile being satisfied in God and yet anticipating
""fulfillment"" in a mate? Is it possible to long for and miss someone I
don't know and yet still see God as the Lover of my soul?<br>
-How do I have a realistic and yet romantic view of love? When I hear
married people continually tell me ""marriage is not all its cracked up
to be"" am I supposed to just accept that? Or is there really a way to
be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in love</span> for a lifetime?
How can I be determined to stay in love and yet have a realistic
expectation of the trials that are part of every relationship?<br>
-What's with all these people that seem like they get into a
relationship just to have someone? How do I really feel about getting
married because I'm ""in love with love"" vs. getting married because I
find someone I ""can't live without.""<br>
-Is love paradoxical? It seems that love hurts so bad, yet in the midst
of all the hurt is also healing. How will I have the courage to take a
risk, to lay my heart on the line, and to pledge my entire life to
someone?<br>
<br>
So that's what this journal is going to be--at
least for awhile. Hopefully in talking out my confused thoughts I'll

They're going to introduce another product, which will most likely be even better, but I was worried that I might run out before the new one is available. So I called Jenni.

Me: When are they going to come out with the new concealer?
Jenni: I'm not sure.
Me: Well, I need to know, because I don't want to run out of my pot before I can get some new, 'cause I'm tellin' ya...<i>I'm really addicted to that pot.</i> :shocked:

I'm serious, it was out before I realized how it sounded. :laughing:

So, yeah, as I was saying the other day, my new job is so cool. I'm working full time at 2BC and I have been working my booty off. It's been so fun, though. I'm the main person in charge of graphic design and publications. I'm also assisting the music ministers, which means preparing the digital presentations for worship services and assisting them with whatever odd jobs they need done. There are a couple of reasons why my job is so fun:

1. My responsibilities--To someone who loves graphic design, there's nothing more fun than having someone come in and say, ""Can you make me a poster advertisement for this?"" and then turn you loose. 2BC has a plotter where I can print out huge posters, and that has been so fun. I also love multimedia, so getting to put together PowerPoint presentations for worship services and adding video...very fun. This is just my forte.

2. The people I work with--The atmosphere in the 2BC office is awesome. The office is run professionally, but people are also flexible. Everyone has fun working there. The relationships between staff members are good. Everyone is grateful and treat each other with respect. I am enjoying getting to know the staff there.

It is really obvious that God has placed me there, and it's amazing to see how He is blessing me for stepping out in faith. I just happened to drop a resume off at the office because I was passing by. I almost didn't leave one there, because I didn't figure they would need someone. I didn't know that they had just been told the lady who previously held my job was leaving. They hadn't even started looking for someone when I dropped off my resume. Imagine my surprise when I got called for an interview and then offered an awesome job! 

It has really shown me that God's grace is more than abundant, and that He desires to bless our lives and give us His best. But often that place of blessing comes from giving up things that are very close to your heart. <b>You have to just close your eyes, climb on the side of the boat, and take that flying leap into the waters of faith. And, like Peter, you feel the force of the water and suddenly realize that you are indeed walking in it...and staring into the loving, beautiful eyes of your Master. And then you wonder why it took you so long to jump in the first place.<b>"

<i>After winning a bronze medal in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, wrestler Rulon Gardner took off hhis shoes, placed them in the center of the mat, and walked away in tears. Through that symbolic act, Gardner announced his retirement from the sport which had defined his life for many years.

<b>Times of walking away come to all of us, and they can be emotionally wrenching.</b> A loved one ""walks away"" in death. A child moves away from home. We leave a job or a community and it feels as if we've left everything behind. But <b>when we know the Lord, we never have to walk into an unknown future alone.</b> 

It's worth pausing to reflect on how much the children of Israel walked away from when Moses led them out of Egypt. <b>They left the heavy burden of slavery, but they also left everything stable and predictable they had ever known. </b> Later, when the Lord told Moses, ""My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest"" (Ex. 33:14), Moses replied, <b>""If Your presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here""</b> (v.15).

During our most difficult times, our stability comes from the presence and peace of God. Because He goes with us, we can walk into the future with confidence.</i> -David McCasland

(Taken from the August 10, 2005 devotional <i>Our Daily Bread</i>)

<b>After much prayer and seeking the Lord through His Word, He's made it very clear that it's time for me to walk away, looking ahead to something new He is doing in my life. I have accepted a full time publications job at Second Baptist Church and my mom and I will be attending Woodland Heights Baptist Church. Our family has been very blessed by the ministry and fellowship we've found at Grace Bible, but God has clearly told us He wants to do something new in our lives. As a Christian, our lives are to be used for the glory of God, and when He says ""go"" we must obey.

My heart is full of amazement at the way God has worked to make this change possible and to give the grace to pursue His will with all my heart. He has given me an incredible excitement about what He is going to do as I obey Him. Like Peter, I've taken a flying leap into the waters of faith and it's awesome to see God performing miracles for His glory. Peace and joy have flooded my soul to know I am obeying God and seeing His blessing. But at the same time, I want all of my friends at Grace to understand that it tears my heart out to leave. To walk away from everything that has been dear to me the last seven years is heart wrenching. I want you to know that you have had an incredible impact on my life and I love you all more than I could ever express. I pray that we will not forget each other, but continue to spur one another on to love and good works in Christ. May God's grace and peace be yours in abundance.</b>

Sean, though we didn't say much more than ""hi,"" it was good to meet you and I hope to get to know you better in the future. David, it was awesome discussing our testimonies, evangelism, salvation, and just life in general. Can't wait to meet your wonderful wife and kids. And I am so grateful for your example of a Christ-centered marriage and your obvious love for your wife.

<b>I love people.</b> I loved tonight, because I was with people...people who love God and want to please Him. <i>I thank God in all my remembrance of you...It is only right for me to feel this way about you, because I have you in my heart, since...you all are partakers of grace with me.

"event","CHILDHOOD MEMORY #4 -- ""In His Time""

One of my earliest memories is of my mom putting me to bed each night. She would snuggle me or kneel beside my bed until I drifted off to sleep. Sometimes she would pray or just talk to me. But the main thing I remember is the songs she would sing. They always calmed and comforted me.

<i>Beautiful, beautiful, Jesus is beautiful,
And <b>Jesus makes beautiful things of my life</b>.
Carefully touching me, causing my eyes to see
<b>That Jesus makes beautiful things of my life.</b></i>

and...

<i>In His time, in His time,
<b>He makes all things beautiful in His time</b>
Lord, please show me every day
As You're teaching me Your way,
That <b>You do just what You say in Your time.</b>

In Your time, in Your time,
<b>You make all things beautiful in Your time</b>
Lord, my life to you I bring,
May each song I have to sing
Be to You a lovely thing in Your time.</i>

I'm sure Mom would never have guessed that twenty years later those songs would still bring me comfort. As an adult, I don't rely on the simple choruses to lull me to sleep each night, but they often provide a soothing balm to a tired heart. When my heart grows weary with waiting, tired of seeing friends all around me fall in love and get married, of experiencing disappointment, of watching passing days turn into passing years waiting for the one that I will someday give myself to completely...then I am drawn to these songs once again. When I was a baby, Mom sang those words to put me to sleep; today I sing them often to myself as a reminder to hope in God's perfect timing. 

He makes even the barren wastleland of waiting beautiful...<b>in His time.</b>"

I started out this morning praying that I would be filled with the Spirit and that the fruits of His Spirit would abound in my life. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that, as a whole, my attitudes and actions today produced the opposite affect. *sigh* But, thankfully, God's grace is sufficient for even my especially rotten days, and right now I'm rejoicing in His forgiveness.

In spite of the bad day caused by my bad attitude, I was enjoying the spring weather immensely. I loved getting to wear my flips and the new skirt I made for Easter. Fun stuff! Ah, how I love flip flop weather. Picture below for anyone who cares:

<img src=""http://users.tcworks.net/~herself/Pics/easteroutfit.jpg"">

The great weather permitted me to enjoy a good bike ride. It might not have been one of those forty-something mile dudes that a lot of you do every day, but it was enough to burn off some calories and get my heart rate up. One of my best friends called while I was out riding and we had a fun chat. But I kept thinking it must've looked funny to passers by to see me riding along, steering with one hand, talking on my cell with the other. 

Well, seeing as how I am sitting here with my eyes closing against my will, I supposed I'd better record my next memory and go spend some quality time with my pillow.

CHILDHOOD MEMORY #3 -- ""Early Memories--Camping Among the Giant Sequoias and Visiting Disneyland""

I was blessed to be born in the beautiful state of California. It seems that before I was born, camping trips to the Giant Sequoias were a regular occurrence in our family. For some reason, after I arrived that all stopped. My family will tell you this is a fact which causes me frustration even decades later (man, I feel old when I say that!). When my family sits around and starts talking about their camping experiences and how breathtaking the giant trees were, I always feel strangely left out and deprived. Thankfully for them, one of my earliest memories does involve camping among the goliath trees. I vaguely remember being afraid of bears, and wanting to stay very close to Mommy and Daddy. And I do remember that the trees were very, very big. But then, when you're 3, everything seems big.

Another of my earliest memories will be etched upon my memory until I am at least one hundred and two, to be sure. No child born in California should be denied a fun-filled day at Disneyland! So they whisked me off to Anaheim before I was old enough to say ""Micky Mouse."" All throughout the day they pumped me up for a special show we were going to see called ""The Bear Country Jamboree,"" which basically consisted of a bunch of stuffed bears that supposedly sang and danced to the delight of all present in the audience. All was fine until they lowered a girl bear on a swing and she began swinging to and fro. Panic gripped my tiny little heart as it suddenly dawned on me that this was no innocent, entertaining show--no, this bear was rapidly swinging toward me, closer and closer. Yes, this bear was after me! In amonst all the clapping and laughing of the audience, a screaming three-year-old's voice could be heard. My voice got louder and louder until finally my dad took pity on the rest and, disappointed, took me outside to calm me down. It's a good thing they didn't take me into the Haunted Mansion! ;-)"

And for those of you who have been wondering, I've finally proved to you that it's possible. <b>Yes, I can be offline for several days and still be perfectly happy.</b> Usually when we go to Oklahoma, I get on Becky's computer to check e-mails and Xanga and stuff. But when I got there this weekend, their montior had been zapped by lightening or something. Thus leaving me ""disconnected"" for three days. I could've gone through the trouble of configuring my laptop with their ISP settings, but I didn't feel like it. 

Anyway, I had a great weekend playing with Aidan. (And seeing my bro-in-law and sis was great, too, of course). We decorated eggs, went to a party, rented a movie, talked late into the night, and Nathan and I played old Atari video games. Before we left, I had bought a skirt pattern and fabric to make a new skirt for Easter. So we worked on that this weekend, and got it all ready for this morning. It it so cute. But some things happened and we ended up not going to church this morning, so I still haven't worn it yet. Mom and I read about the crucifixion and resurrection on the way home. I love the part where Jesus is walking with the men along the road to Emmaus. ""Didn't our hearts burn within us as He told us about the scriptures?"" Ah, that's good stuff.

CHILDHOOD MEMORY #2 -- ""Before I Can Remember--Special Toys, First Word, and a Rather Strange Nickname""

Obviously, I couldn't remember the first couple years of my childhood. But I have been told that I loved my tootle train. It seems I also got immense enjoyment out of carrying around a *bucket of peanut butter. Most kids first learn how to say ""Mama"" or ""Dada,"" but no, my first word was ""tickle,"" which alerted the family early on that I was going to be a very <i>different</i> sort of child. I also had the habit of wrinkling up my nose in a cute manner and making a sort of snorting sound. Supposedly it was very cute, and it earned me the nickname of ""Snorterine"" from my sister Beth. When arriving home from school, she would open the front door and begin to call ""Snorter...Snorterine!"" until she found me. Back then, it was cute, but let's just say I don't giggle and drool when she does it now.

*Does anyone remember when the peanut butter came in those buckets? They had handles and dinosaurs on the outsides?"

Today has been such a Mia Thermopolis kind of day. It would normally be my day off, but I'm at work. Not only that, but I've been given an article for the newsletter that's a nightmare to lay out. I am about to go crazy. I left my coffee and half and half sitting on the kitchen cabinet. There was this really good topic on the LL forum about waiting on God, and it appears that after triple posting on it, I messed the whole thing up and now it's gone into the dark black hole of forumdom. And Meg won't give me a candybar. Ah, well...life goes on. Tomorrow I'll be cuddling my nephew and all my worries will be out the door.

I came home so burdened last night after Bible study. We had a great study, discussed all kinds of topics. I ate tons of olives. We looked at the Wills' pictures from Florida. Ann and I talked 80's talk (""bodacious, dude"").... There's something in my extroverted personality that I get around people and start joking around and my troubles are out the door. But when I got in the car, all the burdens came back. On the way home, my mom told me something that just added to my confusion about where God is taking me. I was restless all night. I got to IM Esther for awhile, and she e-mailed me some song lyrics that encouraged me. I went into my mom's room, and she called me to her. I knelt by her bed, and she laid her hand on my head. I wept as she prayed for me, then went back to my room to do some weeping and praying of my own. Thanks to those of you who are lifting me up before the throne of grace. I can't explain what I'm going through right now, but I know that as God leads me, I'm going to have to step out on faith. My heart is so full--<b>I'm so excited about what God is doing, and yet I am scared of it at the same time.</b> I'll stop trying to explain it, because I can't....

Last Saturday, I spent the day helping my mom mow the lawn and clean out our shed. I came across some diaries and stories I had written as a child. It was so fun to read over them and reminisce about my childhood. I started thinking about how I want to record memories from all throughout my life to look back on later. I think it would be fun. I remember as a child ALWAYS begging my mom to tell me stories of ""when she was a kid,"" so it would be fun to have memories to pass on to my children. So, anyway, when I update, I'm going to start adding a childhood memory to each post. Please don't feel obligated to read them, but just to let you know, they're gonna be there.

MEMORY #1 -- MY LIFE BEGINS, AND OUR FAMILY FINALLY LEARNS THE MEANING OF THE WORD ""CUTE""

I was the only baby my parents planned. My mom had three daughters before me, all of which are very intelligent. Marcie is very smart, social, and witty. She has a lot of skills in organizing and she is very practical. Beth is a genius. Ask her any question, no matter how obscure, and she will be able to tell you the answer. She knows how to do everything from quilting to raising chickens...and she does it extremely well. Rebecca is artistic. From a young age, she drew with amazing skill. She was crafty in more ways than one--she could also design clothes. Yes, my sisters are very intelligent. And they had lots of skills. Well, as we know, guys only like girlfriends who have great skills, which is probably why I am still single at the ripe old age of 22. It seems that after having three very intelligent and skillful daughters, Mom and Dad said, ""Enough with all this intelligence! We need a kid that's cute in this family!"" Thus, I was conceived.

A couple months before I was born, my dad's mother died. All I have to remember my grandmother by is a bunch of crazy stories my family has told me and a lamp of her's that was given to me. As my family was still grieving over the loss of my grandma, I was born. A beautiful new life to comfort after the loss of another. 

So...out I came. ""My, how cute!"" my family exclaimed in delight. True, I had a mop of black hair. True, I had a crooked nose, but they knew this was gonna be one cute child. My mom had always been partial to the name Amanda, which somehow morphed into Mandy as time passed on. My 8-year-old sister Rebecca was given the responsibility of choosing my middle name. I won't repeat it here, but let's just say it's not one of my favorite names in the universe. 

It seems it is the job of the youngest child to just be cute. And so I have done, most pleasantly, I must say. Why, just the other day my mom said to me, ""You know? We spend entirely too much time talking about how cute you are."" I disagreed. It's actually a pretty tough job...but, you know, somebody's gotta do it."

"event","I watched Joan of Arc last night and cried all the way through it. It really hit me how one woman's courage and faith breathed hope and determination into an entire nation. Her life inspired men to take a stand for freedom. As inspring as her life was, however, it was her death that gave Frenchmen the courage to reunite their country. When the English burned her at the stake, it was not only a punishment to her, but a warning sign to the French. But instead of scaring them, it had the opposite effect. It gave them courage. And seven years later, France was free.

The same thing happened with William Wallace. As he united the clans to restore Scotland to independence, he faced tremendous persecution. When he was finally captured by England, he was doomed to a torturous death. After disemboweling him, they beheaded and quartered him. His arms and legs were sent to the corners of the country and his head was mounted on London Bridge to frighten Scots who would dare to even consider continuing the fight for their freedom. But Wallace's death inspired Scottish warriors to carry on his banner. Not many years later, Scotland became independant under the command of Robert the Bruce.

As I sat in Perspectives tonight and heard of missionaries who were giving their lives to take the Gospel to the world, I thought of Wallace, and I thought of the maiden Joan...and I was ashamed. Sure, I can proclaim that I love God until I'm blue in the face, but when it comes right down to it, do my actions show it? Do I show that freedom in Christ is not only worth living for, but worth dying for? And when I see others who are giving their lives for the Gospel, does it spur me on? Does it ignite a fire of courage in my soul? Or does it reveal that I am a coward?"

"event","<P>God has been doing so much in my life the last few months, it awes me. I'm ashamed to admit it, but after going thorugh some painful situations last year, my walk with God became very lukewarm. Sadly, my prayer life suffered greatly. Thankfully, God showed me just how apathetic I had grown toward Him, and I realized I was not striving to be satisfied in Him. </P>
<P>I have always struggled with my prayer life, but during this ""spiritually low"" time, it seemed as if prayer was almost non-existent. It was awful. But, praise God, I finally realized several months ago that I needed to get my booty in gear and <i>earnestly</i> seek Him. Lately, I have been energetically praying for God to make me a woman of prayer. To think, infite joy in His presence is offered to me, and I pass it up for fleeting pleasures. Lately I have been struck with the reality of God's amazing, transforming mercy. He turned Saul into Paul. He turned John, the ""son of thunder,"" to the ""apostle of love."" I long for that kind of powerful transformation in my prayer life. And, slowly, but surely, God is doing it. He has resotred to me the joy of my salvation, and I am finding delight in His presence once more.</P>
<P>I have been learning so much about prayer, and I hardly know how to express it all. But one of the biggest things God has done has shown me the privilege of prayer. It has dawned on me just how much it cost the Son of God for me to enter into His presence with boldness. I would not be able to come before His throne were it not for the incredible forgiveness offered me by God when Christ <b>became sin for me.</b> His agonizing death on the cross is what gives me, a filthy sinner, the ability to come before the holy, spotless Lamb of God. So when I am treating prayer as a chore, rather than a privilege and delight, <b>I am trampling on the blood of Christ. I am spitting in His bloody face. <i>God, may I never take Your shed blood lightly!</i></b></P>

Functioning on very little sleep, I woke up this morning, got ready, and went to work. My day at the office was pretty busy, as I'm still trying to get all my software installed and preferences set from the OS upgrade. Enjoyed talking with Jenni a couple times during the day (Jenno, you're the best). 

At lunch time, we went to the Oak Street Bistro for lunch with Susan and her mom. Susan and I used to go to the  Bistro every week when she was helping out at the office, so it's a tradition. It's a very sentimental place for us to go. Anyway, we were delighted to find out they have added their White Cheddar Dill (the best soup in this entire world) to their everyday menu. We went outside and took a few pictures. My new profile picture was one of them. Here's the other:

I love my Susan, I do.

After my whirlwind day at the office, I ran home, got freshened up, came back into town and met Elise, Rachel, Ross, and Reid for a trip to Little Rock. We were going to see Arkansas Christian Academy perform <i>The Sound of Music.</i> Bri, one of my favoritest people in this entire world, was playing in the orchestra, so I wanted to see her. She did a great job, as did the other musicians and actors/actresses. Lotsa talent in that group of high schoolers, I'll tell ya what! Got to visit with Bri for awhile and we took a quick photo:

<img src=""http://users.tcworks.net/~herself/Pics/soundofmusic.jpg"">
Love, love, love your glasses, Bri.

I also FINALLY got to meet <A href=""http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=paggins"" target=""_new"">DT, inventor of ""What the cow?!""</A>. That was pretty cool, bro.To make things even greater, I was reunited with an old friend, <A href=""http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=st_lucia"" target=""_new"">St_Lucia</A>, whom I have not seen in a long time--and I even caught a glimpse of her Sir Knight. On the way home, Elise and I goofed off the entire time and weirded the Riggans out real bad. It was fun. 

But alas! all good things must come to an end. And so I will make my way to my bed to spend some quality time with my pillow. I bid you a <i>so long, farewell, auf wiedersehen adieu,</i> whatever that means."

Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's <b>root beer</b> in the jar-o

I'm in the midst of preparing for a big St. Paddy's Day ""spraoi,"" at my house tonight, complete with a lot of good food and music. It's gonna be a wild time, and tons of fun. It's going to bring those dance-a-jig type Irish sentiments. But right now as I am sitting here relaxing before the big party, I have more of a melancholy Irish sentiment. Words can't express the emotion that grips me today. I'm tearful.

I cry for for Irish ancestors that perished in the great famine of 1846-47. I cry as I picture them reaching down into the earth to pull up a potato--their only source of food--and finding instead slimy rot. I cry for them watching their loved ones die of terrible diseases and seeing the few that survived turn into living skeletons. I cry for them having to drink the blood of their animals to survive. I cry to think of them having to watch the land that was once their own being controlled by their enemies, of seeing their land provide bountiful supply of grains and vegetables and watching these foods be exported to other countries right in front of their starving eyes. I cry to think of them being evicted from their homes as they were literally rotting away, some of them having their homes torn down on top of them as they were fighting for their lives.

I cry to think of the Irish leaving their beloved homeland to journey to America, the isle of hope. Their poverty forced them to do so. When they left Ireland, they knew they would never see it again, never again would they see the faces of the ones they loved so dearly. And when they reached America many of them were met with hatred and scorn. I cry to think of the Irish who fought courageously in our own Civil War and perished on the battlefield.

I cry over the incredible emotion of the Irish people. Their love is so deep. Their courage is so valiant. Their sorrow is so heart-wrenching. 

I cry as I think of St. Patrick, and the terrible things he endured as he was taken from his home off the coast of Scotland and forced into slavery in Ireland. I cry as I see God's mercy in saving him and giving Patrick a passion for Him as he spend many lonely hours as a shepherd on those green hills. I cry as I think of how he escaped and traveled home--in the safety of his home he dreamed of the people of Ireland crying out, ""We beseech thee, come and walk among us again!"" I cry as I think of how he went back to the very people who had enslaved him and devoted his life to giving them the truth of the Gospel. I cry as I think of the thousands of people who came to know Christ through his ministry. 

And last of all, <b>I cry for Ireland as it is today.</b> So many people who need Christ--people who have been turned off from Protestant Christianity because of the torture their ancestors had to endure from the Protestant English. People who are so rooted in tradition that they will not listen to the truth. <b>This is the land that I love. This is the land that I pray for. How I wish every sould on that Emerlad Isle to understand the Gospel of Christ.

<i>Oh, Erin gra mo chri, you're the dear old land to me!
You're the fairest that my eyes have ever known.
You're the land St. Patrick blessed, you're the bright star of the West!
You're my own native land so far away!</i>"

-The Incredibles came out today! So totally wicked!
-Had a great time talking with my best bud today. What fun.
-I almost electrocuted my fish today. Seriously. I dropped the light into the tank and got it unplugged just when it started to spark. You know the amazing thing? All my critters LIVED. Wow.
-Drinking a great cup of Italian roast. It took me about an hour to make it, so I'm really enjoying it. Reason it took me an hour is due to a lot of crazy interruptions and mishaps, which I will not take time to relate. One of the craziest was when I forgot to put the coffee in the pot before I turned it on. 
-Dan and Lean say that our family is FUN. They hung out with us this weekend, and went back to Beth telling her over and over how FUN we are. :pleased:

"event","I'm so excited about St. Patrick's Day. Today I got some stuff for it and took a closer look at my menu. We are having:

*Shepherd's Pie (the true Irish kind, not the stinky American meatloaf with mashed potatoes bit)
*Soda bread
*Champ (mashed potato dish)
*Oatmeal and hazlenut tuilles with Irish coffee carmel sauce
*Root beer

Ah, it's gonna be great. I love, love, love St. Patrick's Day. I'm so excited.

Well, my bronchitis seems to be healing up. I actually got out of the house today. Went to work. It was a pretty fun day there. I spent my morning helping Tyler with his test. Since he broke his arm, he couldn't fill in the bubbles, so I helped with that. That's me--professional bubble filler.

After that, John and I worked on the work computer. That baby is old. We got it when Apple first came out with the G4. Back then, 10 GB was amazing. Anyway, all this time it's been running system 9. So we're updating that puppy to Jaguar! Yessssss. I've had Jaguar on my iBook forever, so it's been hard for me to work on system 9 at work. My excitement over upgrading my work computer's OS reminds me of something I recently posted on one of my friend's Xanga entries:

<i>...my 20 GB iBook isn't screaming very loudly anymore. But it did when I bought it. It was my first computer running system 10 and I was very happy. I fell in love with those little colored bubbles in iChat. I went crazy downloading mp4's into my iTunes library. I transferred hundreds of pictures into iPhoto and went to work oraganizing them. I put together digital movies and photo shows in iMovie, complete with all the cheesy sound effects and transitions. Yup, it was hard to shut down and go to bed that night. So much fun stuff...so little time. 

Times change. 20 GB is no longer impressive. G3 is old news. I'm still running Jaguar. 700 mHz isn't lightening fast like it was ""way back then."" But my iBook has been through the toughest stuff with me. It's seen me laugh my head off, as well as dealt with my fingers pouding it's translucent keys during my times of ranting and raving. My command key comes loose every two minutes and my trackpad is dirty. It's had Coke spilled on it and the keys have been wet with my tears way more than it's fair share. Once in a blue moon it gets tired of me and locks up...but it definitely has more patience than a Window's machine. 

Yes, I love my Mac. That beautiful snowy whiteness is simply awesome. And what's even more awesome is that God gives us things like Apple and iChat and Pixar and Starbucks and the Mean Bean Cafe to show us that He is good. Humbling, ain't it? :)</i>"

"event","In spite of the fact that I have been hacking up a storm and not doing anything productive, I am about to have a great weekend. Why, you ask? Well, two reasons:

My mom just brought home a bag full of groceries. In among them was some ice cream, a <A href=""http://www.getoffthehype.com/"">Black Cherry Switch</A>, and some herbal medicine. The medicine is gross, but it will make me feel better. The ice cream and the Switch are purely comfort foods. 

The main reason I'm excited though, is, surprisingly, not because of the food. My adorable little 2-1/2 year old nephew Aidan called Mom today. ""Hewwo, G'ma. I comin' to see you about 9:00."" He is the cutest kid that ever walked this earth. I'm serious, I'm so afraid that when I have kids they won't be as cute and I'll feel guilty. Anyway, it's been awhile since I saw Nathan and Becky and Aidan, so we are looking forward to this visit. I think cuddles from Aidan will be just what the doctor ordered. :pleased:

Yesterday I was doing some reasearch about Scottish history and found an interesting bit of trivia: Robert the Bruce's heart was kept and embalmed. It was taken from a lead cylinder bured beneath Melrose Abbey in 1996 and is being kept in a high security vault in Scotland. There are several different stories as to why and how the heart was preserved. Cool, huh? Well, I think so.

Don't you just love those times when you're reading your Bible and God gives you a passage so powerful that it just blows you away? That happened to me yesterday. I had come face to face with my selfishness and I was crying out to God to meet with me and give me mercy that I would love others. I opened my Bible to John 13. Here's what I saw:

Jesus was having supper with His disciples. But this supper with them was different--it would be His last. He was about to be killed. He was about to be betrayed by Judas. He was about to be denied by Peter. And yet in an act of humility and servanthood He rose from the table, took a basin and towel, and began to wash the feet of His disciples. Peter was appalled: ""Lord, <i>You're</i> washing <i>my</i> feet!"" I can see the look on Peter's face like he's thinking <i>What is up with this?! Hello! You're God! I'm man! I should be washing Your feet!</i> Jesus continued to wash his feet, explaining that later Peter would understand His reasons. But in hypocrical false humilty Peter announced, ""Never! You should never wash my feet!"" Jesus tenderly replied, ""Peter, if You don't let me do this, you can't have any part of Me."" Peter's attitude changed as he surrendered, ""Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head."" </i> Jesus began to explain to his disciples that though they all might appear clean, not all of them were. He said this because He knew He was about to be betrayed. The amazing part? <b>He knowingly washed the feet of His betrayer.</b> The spotless, holy Lamb of God humbled Himself to serve the one who was about to give Him up to be killed.

After He finished washing their feet, Jesus looked at them and said, ""Do you know what I just did? Do you understand that I, your Master and Lord, just washed your feet?"" As the humbling truth sunk in, Jesus revealed one of the reasons for this act of servanthood: <b>""If <i>I</i>, being holy, washed <i>your</i> sinful, unholy feet, how much more should you wash each other's feet?""</i></b> Can you imagine the shocked silence? Jesus just leveled the field. All of a sudden it was clear that they were all equally sinful. <i>Quit exalting yourself above each other</i> He was saying. <i>You're all sinners. But if I served sinners, how much more should you sinners be willing to lay aside your pride and serve each other?</i>

<b>THE BASIN AND THE TOWEL</b>
<i>by Michael Card</i>

And the call is to community 
In an upstairs room
A parable is just about to come alive
And while they bicker about who's best
With a painful glance He'll silently rise
Their Savior Servant must show them how
Through the will of the water
And the tenderness of the towel

CHORUS
And the call is to community
The impoverished power that sets the soul free
In humility to take the vow
That day after day we must take up
The basin and the towel

In any ordinary place
On any ordinary day
<b>The parable can live again
When one will kneel and one will yield
Our Savior Servant must show us how</b>
Through the will of the water
And the tenderness of the towel

<b>And the space between ourselves sometimes
Is more than the distance between the stars
By the fragile bridge of the servant's bow
We take up the basin and the towel</b>"

"event","It's funny how people like to advise you on what to do with your life. 

Some things I've been hearing lately:

""You need to go to college."" (times this by about 10)
""You don't need to go to college.""
""When are you getting married?""
""I know a guy I can introduce you to.""

It's frustrating. It's downright funny sometimes. So today my sister and I were hanging out, and I asked her, ""Why is it that people think they know what you should do with your life?""

""Well,"" she said, ""it's because everyone thinks they are the ultimate authority and that they are always right and you should agree with them so you can be right, too. But what they need to understand is that the answer to life is really 42."" So there ya go. Keep that in mind. Whenever you are confused and trying to find the answer in life, Beth has it: it's 42. :laughing:

Yeah, but seriously guys, I am at a transition point in my life right now. I'm not one for new experiences. I""m not a visionary. Typically I focus on the here and now and I'm a creature of habit and don't mind if my life is realatively monotonous. So I'm sensing right now that God has something in mind...that there's some new way He wants to use me. I'm not sure what that is right now, but I know it's going to require a lot of faith. So if I come to mind, pray for me...please."

"event","From my quiet time this morning: <b>""One thing have I asked of the Lord, that I will seek after--<i>that I may behold the beauty of the Lord and meditate in His temple.</i>""</b> (Ps. 27:4)
--
Yesterday was a pretty good day. After a good church service on Ephesians 4, the elders announced that John Sherman is officially taking the role of pastor/teacher. I'm looking forward to seeing how God will continue to use him here at Grace. He has been an inspiration to so many through his passionate love for God.

After church I went to Fazoli's with the Brazeals and John just like usual. Had a great time laughing and talking, and finally we headed over to the Grace's (they were gone, so we were all just hanging out there). The plan was to watch some old Brazeal home videos, but John couldn't find them so we just played a good long game of Loaded Questions. After that we began to help John clean up the house. I was about to head off for church when Mrs. Brazeal turned to me and said, <b>""So, tell me what you think about courtship and dating.""</b> An hour long conversation followed, and it could have gone longer but I finally decided I'd better head out the door. So I went to church, caught the last 15 minutes of singing and praying, and then had an interesting conversation with Jeremiah about how his Mercedes runs on peanut oil. After that, Mom and I went to Chili's for dinner. Yum! 

So there's the low-down on my day, which to me was quite enjoyable. Oh, and by the way, in case you don't realize it already, <b>I was the first to sign Tyler's cast.</b> And speaking of Tyler, they should be getting here pretty soon for Heather's piano lesson, which means an hour of goofing off with Tyler. It usually consists of having fights with the little cans of pressurized air, but I don't know what we're going to do today since it seems to be all gone.

Thankfully, I did have a good evening. Beth came over and she, Mom, and I watched some episodes of Monk. And, just for the record, I think Monk is the coolest show out there right now. And those who think he's a nerd can just...keep quiet about it. Anyway, we were watching Season One, but I really want to see Season Two. I'm just not sure where I can rent it. Anybody know?

I feel like I have nothing to tell you guys. My life has been almost completely boring the last week and a half as I've been sick. It's consisted of some computer stuff, watching movies, playing the Sims, and reading. *sigh*

I have been listening to some awesome sermons from <A href=""http://www.covlife.org/tools/sermons.php"">Covenant Life Church</A>. I was burning some from the ""Christ and Him Crucified"" series by CJ Mahaney for a friend and got to listening to them myself. Awesome stuff. I also started listening to their new series on prayer. Prayer is an area God has really been speaking to me about lately, so I pray He'll use these sermons to teach me more about prayer. Oh, and one of my friends informed me that CJ Mahaney is supposed to speak at the Bible Church in the fall! I hope it works out for me to hear him. This man's teaching has changed my life, and it would be neat to hear him in person.

Anyway, I'll sign off now with my fingers crossed, hoping you guys won't fall asleep in the middle of reading this entry. ;-)"

The most hilarious thing happened to me on Saturday. I went into town to get a haircut and a white shirt to wear to our church's Valentine Banquet that night. I searched ALL OVER TOWN for a white shirt, and it was crazy how hard it was to find one. Everything's in color this year! I love the color stuff, but I HAD to have white this time, so it was an extremely frustrating morning. I finally found one at Belk that I liked. Anyway...on to the funny story. I went into Target thinking I might be able to find a white shirt there. While I was hunting, I heard some women talking excitedly about the St. Patrick's Day shirts that were out. They were going on and on about how cute they are. Out of curiosity, I went by to spy on them. I walked by and saw that they were Mexicans. If that wasn't funny enough, they were getting the shirts that said ""Made in Ireland"" (meaning, of course, that the wearer was made in Ireland). It was hysterical! And while we're on the subject, <b>this is one of my pet peeves. America is so quasi-Irish it's disgusting.</b> I hate going into stores around St. Paddy's Day and seeing all the tacky green leprechaun stuff. The one that REALLY gets me is the quote you see around: ""On St. Patrick's Day, everyone is Irish!"" Gag. 

I am so excited about this weekend because my mom and I are going to a Celtic festival. Yay! It's mostly a music festival, so it should be way fun. They're going to have some Irish sword dancing and Scottish fling. I am so excited!

On a more serious tone, so many of my friends are hurting badly right now. It's so hard for me to watch. I can think of about 15 friends who are going through really hard things right now, and my heart feels so burdened for all of them. It is driving me to prayer, though, so I'm grateful for that. <b>I just want you all to know that I love you so much and am praying for you. I look forward to seeing what God will do in your lives as a result of these trials.</b>"

<img src=""http://users.tcworks.net/~herself/peanutsvalentine.jpg"">

--
The last couple of days God has really been impressing on me <b>His ability to glorify Himself in <i>every</i> situation.</b> Right now I'm going through some relationship problems that are confusing and frustrating. Many of my friends have recently confessed to me that they are hurting from situations in their lives. My natural instict is <i>remove the pain and everything will be okay.</i> But that kind of outlook is not Biblical. Everything that happens to us has been allowed by God. Although He doesn't make men sin and doesn't enjoy inflicting pain (Lam. 3:32-33), suffering comes upon all of us. Sometimes life is just the pits. But <b>God allows pain for a purpose. And that purpose is <i>always</i> eternal.</b>  Instead of asking God to remove the pain, my prayer should be that He would accomplish His purpose to bring Himself glory, to draw us to worship. 

So, to all my friends out there that are going through painful and confusing circumstances, I want you to know you are in my prayers. I want to remove your pain and your confusion. But even more than that I want to see God glorified. My prayer is that <b>you would cling to God.</b> My prayer is that <b>your hope and your joy would be found in Him.</b> Remember that <b>God is <i>seeking</i> worshippers.</b> (John 4:23) And He's calling your name. He's calling my name. My strongest prayer is that we, like Moses, would fervently beseech Him, <b><i>""Please, show me Your glory!""</i></b> (Gen. 33:18)"

All the wrong guys like me. It's Valentine's Day, and all the people I <i>don't</i> want want me. Why does romance have to be so complicated? Yes, my heart hurts.

But when my heart hurts, it means God is up to something special in there. It's like surgery...it's incredibly painful but if you respond properly you end up much healthier in the end.

A friend of mine recently gave me this advice:

<i>Run hard after God. Then at the right time, turn and look at who is running beside you. Then take another look.</i> 

And hey, it's all about God anyway, right? His whole purpose in giving us the gift of romance is to bring glory to Himself. It's really not all about me--it's all about Him. And when I make it all about Him, He's glorified and I'm blessed.

Sounds like a good system to me.

But still...I have to be honest and admit...my heart hurts."

"event","I have a wild weekend planned. Tomorrow some people are coming over to watch Looney Tunes and eat food and stuff. Fun times. Saturday night I'm serving at our church's Sweetheart Banquet. I am looking forward to a great weekend.

Ok, I have to tell you guys about my embarrassing moment last week. I invited a few friends to spend the night on Friday. We stayed up until 5:30 AM watching chick flicks and had a blast. Early on in the night, during the middle of Sense and Sensibility, my friend Lauren got a phone call from her fiance, Luke. Luke asked her to go outside, where he was waiting with a boquet of flowers. Problem was, no one knew he was out there. So after awhile I went outside in my new bright pink pajamas. I stepped out on the front porch and exclaimed, ""Wow! I feel so pink tonight!"" I continued to say it a few more times until I had done a thorough job of making a spectacle of myself. Imagine my surprise when I heard a deep male voice call out of the dark, ""Hi."" Ahh! I could've died. It was another one of those ""Mandy moments,"" as one of my friends calls them. Luke thought it was pretty funny though, evidentally. Ha!

I have had an awesome time taking this Perspectives course a few friends told me about. God provided what I needed to sign up for the whole course, so I am really excited! I really believe it's going to be a life-changing thing for me. On Tuesday, we heard about the Kingdom of God. It was an all-around good message, but the speaker made this comment:

The clearest place we see the Kingdom now is in the lives of Spirit-filled believers.

So thanks, everybody, for being His Kingdom to me. You guys are really a blessing to my faith."

"event","Last week I was feeling sorry for myself because I hadn't been asked out in a long time. You know, just kind of the usual selfish wondering if I was just unattractive or what was wrong with me thing. Today I was sitting at 'bucks having coffee with Meg when my cell phone rang. It was it my mom. ""You'll never guess who just stopped by here,"" said she. It was a guy I sorta know. Nice guy, but I haven't seen him in at least a couple of years. He wanted to know if I would go to a Valentine Banquet with him on Saturday night. All of a sudden I was glad I don't get asked out. I don't like saying no to people. It was kind of a funny situation, but there was a lesson in it I needed to be reminded of. Namely, not to be selfish and want attention that won't mean squat in the end, and to trust God. He knows what He's doing with my life. I don't need a bunch of guys to be attracted to me--just one. The right one. :pleased: 

I went to the eye doctor today. Got my contacts. Yea! Dr. Todd is so cool. He always gives me free stuff and things. Asks me about my job. He's awesome. 

Also had a great time with Meg at Starbucks. We don't get to talk much, so it was really great. She is such a blessing to me. I love you, girl!

Had a few fun phone conversations with friends, and now I am getting ready to head into town for the Perspectives course I'm taking. I'll get to hang with some friends there, and learn about God. My social bucket is getting filled, so I'm happy. And after tonight, hopefully my spiritual bucket will be fuller, as well. How could I ask for more? 

Oh, yeah, and the weather is nice enough today for me to wear my wonderful Life is Good flip flops shirt. Yesssss."

A FEW QUOTES ON RISK-TAKING LOVE*
<i>Or, what I think about the emotional purity movement</i>

""Seeking to honor God in the area of romance is not a fomula for avoiding pain. Rather, honoring God is an end in itself and a means of avoiding regret.""

""Of all arguments again love none makes so strong an appeal to my nature as 'Careful! This might lead to suffering.' To my nature, my temperment, yes. Not to my conscience. When I respond to that appeal I seem to myself to be a thousand miles away from Christ. If I am sure of anything I am sure that His teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities. I doubt whether there is anything in me that pleases Him less... Even if it were granted that insurances against heart-break were our highest wisdom, does God Himself offer them? Apparently not. Christ comes at last to say 'Why has thou forsaken me?'... There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal... The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. I believe that the most lawless and inordinate loves are less contrary to God's will that a self-invited and self-protective lovelessness... Christ did not teach and suffer that we might become, even in the natural loves, more careful of our own happiness. If a man is not uncalculating towards the earthly beloveds whom he has seen, he is none the more likely to be so towards God whom he has not. We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him; throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they break, so be it."" ~C.S. Lewis

This weekend I was in Oklahoma visiting my super cute nephew (and the rest of the family). We had fun. Rebecca and I went to a creative writing class, which was awesome. I may post one of the things that I wrote on here--still trying to decide. We watched a couple of movies and pigged out on 7-layer-dip and Pepsi, as always. I was watching this program on the Travel Channel, ""The Top Ten Food Factories to Visit in the US"" or something. One of the places was Ben & Jerry's. Did you know that they have a graveyard at the food factory where you can pay tribute to discontinued flavors? I kid you  not! You can actually visit this graveyard and put flowers on the tombstones! Here's hoping Cherry Garcia never makes it there. After we got home yesterday, I went by Wal-Mart and of course I couldn't help but go grab a pint. This time I got ""Uncanny Cashew."" Good stuff!

I did something incredibly stupid today. I'm ashamed to tell you about it, but it's so stupid I can't resist because I know it will make you laugh. I was testing all morning (math, no less) and my brain was totally fried. I drove up to Backyard Burgers and ordered lunch. The total was $5.55. I made out my check and got my food and left. Later this afternoon I got a call from the manager. He was like, ""You came in here earlier and got a meal for $5.55, but you wrote us a check for $50.00."" <b>Ha! Talk about embarrassment!</b>

Lately my attention was once more been drawn to the cross and I have realized that the blood of Christ is what my life should be centered around. I was thinking yesterday about the crucifixion, and how I saw myself in so many of the tools used to torture Christ. It is always humbling to me to think that I drove the nails into His hands, that I spit on Him, that I mocked Him, that I am the solider that was responsible for His torturous death. But yesterday I found myself relating to a new character: <b>Barabbas.</b> The thought of the multitudes crying for Barabbas the sinner to be released and Christ, the perfect God-man to be put to death has always made me feel kind of angry. But it really hit me yesterday: <b>I am Barabbas. I am the sinful wicked one who was allowed to go free at the expense of the spotless Lamb of God.</b> Wow...that one thought alone brings me to my knees. 

I have so much more on my mind, but I have to go for now. Thanks everyone for praying for me. God is definitely moving mountains in my life right now."

Last night I got to talk with my best bud on the phone for a long time. We talked about a lot of stuff...we cried together and laughed together. It was a good time. Then today I enjoyed several really awesome conversations with good friends. It started out hanging out with Tyler this morning. He brought Heather's puppy Pete in and we had fun playing with him. Throughout the day as I talked to different friends on the phone and on IM or e-mail, I cheered up more and more, encouraged by their funny stories and sense of humor or in some cases their understanding and assurance of prayer. Thanks, my friends, for being there to lift me up when I'm falling. And please keep praying for me.

Some of you remember Andrew and William Harper. We got an e-mail this morning saying that William is about to leave for Iraq this weekend. He was married last spring and he and his wife Amanda are expecting their first child in June. Andrew is in California still studying Arabic and then will train in Texas. After that they don't know where he is going, but he is supposed to graduate in May. It was great to hear from them. Awesome couple of guys.

In the ten minutes I observed them, they managed to cover rodeos, how much they loved a good bowl of beans and cornbread, potatoes, horses, and every Southern vocabulary word in the book.

"event","The past year has been pretty tough for me relationship-wise. (Not complaining, just sharing.) My relationships have done a complete switch for the most part. I am grateful though, for those friends who always seem to be there. When I think about the friends who are just always there, and the other friends who seem to come and go, I think a lot about what makes a true friend. And I pray that God would make me this kind of friend to people I know. I've been thinking about what makes good relationships the past couple of days, and keep trying to remind myself of these points:

1. True friends are lovingly honest. They will tell you the truth about matters, but then leave it up to you to make a decision. 
2. True friends are trustworthy. They don't talk about you behind your back, even when everyone else is.
3. True friends don't let you make foolish mistakes without speaking up. They express concern when they see you heading toward the edge of a cliff. True friends also listen when you express concern. They are not defensive; they want to hear what you have to say.
4. True friends share you with other friends. They don't see you as someone to keep all to themselves. They don't act possessive.
5. True friends don't pressure you. Your friendship has freedom.
6. True friends don't demand you to conform to their ideas and standards. They trust your judgement. They also don't ask you to conform to their interests, but are glad to see you be your own person.
7. True friends don't bail out when trouble comes. Instead, they stand by your side and support you through the stuff of life, even if it is inconvenient for them.
8. True friends are not afraid of each other.
9. True friends depend on God first, and then on each other.
10. True friends admit their weaknesses to you and don't put on an act of having it all together. 
11. True friends change their behavior when you tell them they've hurt you. They don't just let it end in an apology--they take action to correct the problem.
12. True friends work through problems in a relationship rather than avoiding them.
13. True friends earn trust, rather than demanding it.
14. True friends are concerned about ""we"" more than they are about ""I.""
15. True friends encourage freedom. They do not hold onto you as if you're a dependant child...they are excited to see you be a separate person.
16. True friends confront honestly in love rather than flattering you.
17. True friends are consistant, their friendship doesn't fade over time.
18. True friends forgive rather than condemn.
19. True friends are a positive influence on your life and spur you on to love and good deeds."

"event","Today has been very emotional for me. It seemed like one thing after another happened that made me want to burst into tears. Usually I would do that but with the house full of people right now it is somewhat difficult. 

One thing that was very painful was when my family went to visit my dad's grave. I go there often, and of course it is always emotional, but today was even more so because we were all together. My mom, sister Marcie and her family, Beth, and I all there. I was just remembering some of those times in the past when Dad was around, and wishing he could be with us still. 

You know, I have told my mom many times that I will be happy if my marriage is half as good as hers. My dad was not a spiritual leader in our home, and in fact I am not even sure he was a Christian. I DO want to marry someone who is a spiritual leader--more than anything. But I also want to marry someone I am head over heels in love with, and he with me. That's the way Mom and Dad were. He adored her, and she him. I remember him coming home from work every day and immediately looking her up for a kiss. ""Honey, I'm home!"" he would yell. He wolf-whistled at her all the time and praised her in front of his children. Growing up, when I went to friends' homes where there was a lot of fighting in the house I would come home depressed and confused. Why? Well, our home wasn't like that. In fact, it was so rare for Mom and Dad to have a fight that when they did, it scared the life out of me. They snuggled up next to each other when in the car, and Mom used to take me to town during Dad's lunch break so we could hang out with him for half an hour. They loved to be around each other, even after all those years of being married. As I've been thinking about this kind of love lately, it just suddenly hit me that <i>that's how marriage is meant to be.</i> We're fed so many lies nowadays about how being in love is only a phase and passes once you're married for awhile. I'm glad to be able to say that I know that's not true...I know because I've seen that theory proven wrong. And the other night, it floored me when I felt God remind me, <i>""That's how I want it to be for you.""</i> It so stunned me that I went to my mom in tears and said, <i>""Mom, God wants me to be <b>cherished</b> by someone!""</i> Somewhere God has someone for me who will love me for who I am. And when I find him, I don't think I'll be able to resist falling head over heels.

People have asked me if I'm making any New Year's Resolutions. I don't usually make resolutions, but each year I do have one thing in mind, <i>I want to learn how to love others.</i> At each year's end, I look back and ask myself, <i>Have I learned unconditional love more this year? Is my love more Christ-like now than it was last year?</i> So this year I do have a goal of learning to love more like Christ does. Sometimes I get so sick and tired of having to deal with a lot of hard relationships. I get tired of all the misunderstandings and rumors and rejections and changes and disappointments. But through the pain of it all, I have to remind myself, <i>This is what I asked for. This is what is teaching me to love.</i>"

"event","Well, life has been very interesting here in the Bearden house. Last night and today there were 16 people in our house, most of which are kiddos...and those of you who have been in our house know what that would be like. It's like a circus. We are having a good time, though, and I'm never lacking for company. Most of the time there are two or three kids trying to sit in my lap and several trying to tell me stories at the same time. And I'm followed wherever I go. It makes me seriously think about my desire to have my own family, and how many kids I'd like to have. Having a whole houseful is pretty wild...not sure I'd go for that. I think three would be cool. 

Got to go to lunch with the Brazeals today. That was such fun, since Christmas and different things have caused me to miss our regular lunch dates several weeks in a row now. We went to Fazolis, as always, and discussed all of our usual subjects--how much I hate Newsies, the ingredients in their Ranch salad dressing, how Judy Garland is melodramatic, Jane Powell's vibrato annoying, and we have mutual friends in the Ferrens. We also got to see our favorite workers, who we named ""The Brother of That Girl,"" and ""The Sister of That Guy."" We believe they're twins. Every week John suggests that we ask if they're brother and sister, and every week I say, ""Why? We know they're related."" Anyway, not that anybody cares, but I care, and so I am writing about it. 

I have been so happy the last few days. I don't know what it is, but God has just given me so much joy in who He is. He is showing me just how sovereign He is, and how He sees all and knows what's best for me. I am seeing more and more just how great it is do follow God's will rather than my own. I have always said one of the things I love about God is that many times He gives me what I need instead of what I want. Amazing that He loves me THAT much. Wow.

Here's a family picture. Thought you might enjoy seeing the entire Bearden clan.

"event","Today I have been downloading commercials from the 80's. <A href=""http://www.xanga.com/flutewoman3"">flutewoman3's</A> recent entry about an 80's party reminded me of a website I came across awhile bak that had archived commercials from the 80's. So I have had a fun time watching some old commercials from when I was a kid.

Along the same lines, yesterday I took a trip down memory lane. I ran to the post office, and was feeling the need to spend some time alone in prayer. So I drove around for awhile. I drove past the houses in the area where we used to live, and remembered days gone by. 

-The house where we once accidentally set off hundreds of bottle rockets at my birthday party--kids running in every direction and screaming--nevertheless a fun memory
-My best friend's house across the street, where we spent hours playing Barbies (or I would desert her for Cops 'n Robbers and Hot Wheels when her brother was around)
-The shack (no joke) where a little boy lived that came and played Zorro with me
-The home of a bully--I used to threaten to put on my cowboy boots and stomp on his toes if he didn't leave me alone
-The creek where I just <i>swore</i> I saw an alligator one time
-The house of the neighbor boy I had a crush on

And I could go on and on...good times.

I also stopped at the cemetery where my dad was buried. I love to go to the cemetery. After I spend awhile at my dad's grave, I enjoy just looking around at the tombstones, reflecting over each life that was lost. <i>There's a mother and her newbotn daughter--they must have died during childbirth. There's a sister and brother who died on the same day--was it an awful accident? There's a military man--he probably served in WWII!</i> I also always notice the graves of husbands or wives, and notice that when one dies, many times the spouse follows shortly after. That is another reminder to me of <i>how strong true love really is.</i> Many times the pain of separation is so great that the spouse <b>honestly</b> <i>can't live without the other</i>.

It also reminds me of the shortness of life. Like it says in Isaiah, our lives are a passing vapor. None of us is guaranteed tomorrow. As I wandered throughout the graves, and thought about the uncertainty of life, I prayed to God that I would make my life count for something. I don't want to waste it away on frivilous pursuits--each moment should count for eternity. As one man's tombstone so wisely stated:

<i>One life to live
That soon will pass,
Only what's done 
For Christ will last.</i>"

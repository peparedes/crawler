2. Go to IMDb and find a quote from each movie. 
3. Post them here for everyone to guess. 
4. Fill in the film title once it's guessed. 
5. NO GOOGLING/using IMDb search functions. 

1. We were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged and fashed, it being a night of no small expenditure. 

2. Person 1: This is pathetic.
Person 2: You're pathetic.

3. You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent. 

4. He left my his c-c-c... He left me his c-c-c... Oh, he fucking gave me this. Fuck! Ass! 

5. You are a fear prisoner. Yes, you are a product of fear. 

6. Who said that? Who the fuck said that? Who's the slimy little communist shit, twinkle-toed cocksucker down here who just signed his own death warrant? Nobody, huh? The fairy fucking godmother said it. Out-fucking-standing. I will PT you all until you fucking die. I'll PT you until your assholes are sucking buttermilk. 

7. You see this knife? I'm gonna teach you to speak English with this fucking knife! 

8. [in Japanese] Those of you lucky enough to have your lives, take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now. 
[in English] EXCEPT YOU, SOFIE! You stay right where you are! 

9.  Person 1: If I had met you forty years ago, you would have been my Number One lady. 
Person 2: Well, I'm flattered. 
Person 1: You goddamn better well be. 

10. Killing is wrong. And bad. There should be a new, stronger word for killing. Like badwrong, or badong. Yes, killing is badong. From this moment, I will stand for the opposite of killing: gnodab.  

11. Person 1: What are you doing now? 
Person 2: Averting our eyes, oh Lord. 
Person 1: Well, don't. It's just like those miserable psalms, always so depressing. Now knock it off! 

12. Person 1: The mill's closed. There's no more work. We're destitute. 
Group: Ohhhhh. 
Person 1: I'm afraid I have no choice but to sell you all for scientific experiments. 

13. This suit is really cramping my Hardy Boys. It's no mystery. 

14. Person 1: [on the phone as he drives to the warehouse] All I know is what Vic told me. He said the place turned into a fucking bullet festival. He took a cop as hostage, just to get the fuck outta there. 
[pause] 
Person 2: Do I sound like I'm joking? He's fuckin' driving around with a cop in his trunk!   

15. Person 1: So I'm rappelling down Mount Vesuvius when suddenly I slip, and I start to fall. Just falling, ahh ahh, I'll never forget the terror. When suddenly I realize ""Holy shit, Hansel, haven't you been smoking Peyote for six straight days, and couldn't some of this maybe be in your head?"" 
Person 2: And? 
Person 1: And it was. I was totally fine. I've never even been to Mount Vesuvius. 

16. Person 1: Hey, Blinkin! 
Person 2: Did you say ""Abe Lincoln""? 

17. You see life is like that. We change, that's all. You see, the guy I am now is not the guy I was then. If the guy I was then met the guy I am now he'd beat the shit out of me. Those are the facts.  

18. Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the Emperor of Rome.  

19. Whatcha got ain't nothin new. This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity. 

20. [challenged to say if he considers anything holy]  Yes. The individual human mind. In a child's power to master the multiplication table, there is more sanctity than in all your shouted ""amens"" and ""holy holies"" and ""hosannas."" An idea is a greater monument than a cathedral. And the advance of man's knowledge is a greater miracle than all the sticks turned to snakes or the parting of the waters."

Just because I'm not desperate and I don't need a boyfriend.  And I'm DEFINITELY not desperate enough to date anyone online (especially for two years to a person who mite be as far away as TEXAS).  Remember, nobody wanted to fucking touch you before Amanda, and now she's been your little ego-booster because she puts up with your shit.  You're not cool and a lot of people still hate you and think your a fucking pansy, but none of them will say anything about it.  And I don't know who the fuck you think you are commenting on my journal calling my friends fags.  You don't know josh so you should shut the fuck up.  You think you're so tough and hardass but you're not shit.  So get the fuck over yourself.  And calm the fuck down, I didn't know that you cared about what I thought THAT much to get you sooo upset.  Don't get your fucking panties in a bunch. 

PS  It's really sad that when you did say all that shit to me, you didn't even give me the time to say anything back.  That says a lot you fucking pansy."

Her husband responds, ""They're twins! If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal.""

8. Some friars were behind on their belfry payments, so they opened up a small florist shop to raise funds. Since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of God, a rival florist across town thought the competition was unfair. He asked the good fathers to close down, but they would not. He went back and begged the friars to close. They ignored him. So, the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to ""persuade"" them to close. Hugh beat up friars and trashed their store, saying he'd be back if they didn't close up shop. Terrified, they did so, thereby proving that Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.

9. Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet.

"event","Top doc backs picking your nose and eating it

Picking your nose and eating it is one of the best ways to stay healthy, 
according to a top Austrian doctor.

Innsbruck-based lung specialist Prof Dr Friedrich Bischinger said people who 
pick their noses with their fingers were healthy, happier and probably 
better in tune with their bodies.

He says society should adopt a new approach to nose-picking and encourage 
children to take it up.

Dr Bischinger said: ""With the finger you can get to places you just can't 
reach with a handkerchief, keeping your nose far cleaner.

""And eating the dry remains of what you pull out is a great way of 
strengthening the body's immune system.

""Medically it makes great sense and is a perfectly natural thing to do. In 
terms of the immune system the nose is a filter in which a great deal of 
bacteria are collected, and when this mixture arrives in the intestines it 
works just like a medicine.

""Modern medicine is constantly trying to do the same thing through far more 
complicated methods, people who pick their nose and eat it get a natural 
boost to their immune system for free.""

He pointed out that children happily pick their noses, yet by the time they 
have become adults they have stopped under pressure from a society that has 
branded it disgusting and anti social.

He said: ""I would recommend a new approach where children are encouraged to 
pick their nose. It is a completely natural response and medically a good 
idea as well.""

And he pointed out that if anyone was really worried about what their 
neighbour was thinking, they could still enjoy picking their nose in private 
if they still wanted to get the benefits it offered."

just sing sing death house
for gypsy rose lee
till the blackest years
that the girl fixer
walks the red carpet and rebellion
till its idoless

when punk rock love
is solvent to worriors
and becomes horror business
and distilla truant

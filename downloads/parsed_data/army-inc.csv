"event","Well, the dilly is that i will get a new brace sometime near the end of the week.  But the problem is that is costs $1100!!!!!!  It should look cool though.  It fades from Red to Black as it goes down my leg.  
Lancaster wrestling didn't do too well at the Sub Region Tournament either.  We only had 3 wins out of the entire day!  That's not alot.
THe weekend went well though.  I got to see Michelle for 2 and 1/2 days!  That's very rare in our long distance relationship.  It was nice.  I am glad I was able to see her.  It was just nice!  It might happen again next weekend only she will stay at her house intsead of ours.  But that's cool.
Well, I am FINALLY able to walk and able to drive again.  SO i am happy about that."

"event","I am sick.  And being sick sucks.  I can't really have any good cereals because the milk might curdle in my stomach and I might throw up (if you didn't know, I HATE throwing up, it's the nastiest thing in the world).  Plus, i just don't want milk curdleing in my stomach, that would be gross.  But none the less, i can't have any.  That makes me sad.  Oh yeah, the middle of the night waking up thing (it happened like 6 times) didn't help either.  I was cold, sweaty, and hot all at the same time.  DO  YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THAT SUCKS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  well it does.  But oh well.
 
    On a better note, hopefully Michelle will come home this weekend and I can see her again.  Lex is coming home too.  So that's pretty cool.  ANyways, i got stuff to do (not really, but i just dont know how to end this).  later"

"event","Man, my Valentine's day was a good one!  I was able to get a ride with Josh up to Richmond and surprise Michelle.  I was just able to hang out with her, just her, alexa was in her own little world (mainly a sick one because she didn't feel too good).  But it was nice.  Just Michelle and I, alone (for most of the night) with distractions from everyone else that would normally be in the appartment.  It was also just nice to visit Alexa.  We all went to a rugby game the next day.  Lemme tell you, that is one interesting sport to watch, especially if you don't know what's goin on.  So Me, Jennifer, and her boyfriend Ricky just made fun of the ref and called him ""Pinky.""

Then Michelle and I drove back home through snow and ice.  That was interesting.  But then we finally got home and was almost locked out of my house because kyle borrowed my car and i couldn't find my keys.  That kinda sucked because it was SOOOOOOOO COLD!  We eventually got inside.  THat was good.  THen it was just more alone time.  Not like the ""nasty""' alone time, but nice alone time.

When you can't see your significant other for a really long time, you learn the true meaning of love.  And it's great!"

"event","yeah, remember that night i told you that i hurt my knee during a wrestling match?  well, aparently i tore ACL and some Meniscus Cartilege and had to have surgery on my knee on the 27th of January.  It kinda sucks, but it could be worse.  It could have been amputated.  That would REALLY sucked!  But on to better things.
 
 VMI is looking better and better everyday.  I took the ACT test and recieved a much better score of a 22 (better than my SAT's).  THey found out about my history with my great uncle and cousin so hopefully things will look good there, and also the trust that my step dad left to them after my mother dies.  So maybe with all that bling, and the history, i will get in.  My grades aren't that bad so I would also have them to help me get in.         But, my back up college was VCU.  I have been accepted into VCU and will go there if VMI doesn't work out.  SO i dont have to go to RCC (THANK GOD!).  SO i am happy about that.

     With the surgery on my knee though how ever, i am not able to join the Marine Corp Reserve like i was planning to if i didn't get into VMI.  SO that will have to wait.  I am not even allowed to wrestle again until July, and this injury was in December.  But, i would much rather get healthy than screw my knee up for the rest of my life.  Well, there really isn't much else to say except for the fact that i HATE mrs. Smyre because she can't teach and doesn't try so i iwll leave it at that.

  But the good thing is that Michelle is coming down tonight and not driving to richmond so i get to have one more night with her before she ventures back to the urban arena know as VCU.  SO i am happy."

"event","Aight man, lemme tell you fools what happened today at a wrestling match.  It pissed me off too!  Aight, Oren (my coach) decided that it would be a good idea to wrestle AA schools.  Well, we went up there, got stomped, and then 2 of our wrestlers happened to get hurt.  One with a dislocated shoulder and the other with a toe up knee.  I happened to be the one with the toe up knee.  Lemme tell you, it hurts like HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't really do anything.  It will probably hurt when i go take a shower.  So i am pretty pissed off.  And, i wrestled another guy and i coulda beaten him like a red headed step-child if i was in perfect condition.  But, my knee acted up and i got disqualified by injury.  So i am pretty pissed!"

"event","<P>     School sucks!  I am supposed to be working on one of my English papers, but I just have no freakin clue on how to start it.  So I have decided to get rid of all of my frustrations out on this!  Stupid me forgot all of my notes on this paper in the art room,  AT SCHOOL!  So I am S.O.L. and I don't mean Standards Of Learning. </P>
<P>     VMI.  The school of my dreams.  Well, so far my dream is still only a dream.  As I talk my dream diminishes into a thousand little dreams until I can't remember it anymore.  Stupid SAT tests.  They mean nothing.  That can't determine who I am and how good an all around person I am.  I got a freaking 890 on my SAT's, but I also got a 3.9 on my report card.  SO WHY WON'T THEY ACCEPT ME!?  THis is bull crap!</P>
<P>     Another thing that I need to get off of my mind.  EMILY! STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!  Yes we are friends, but how many times have I said that I don't want to go out with you.  Get it through  your thick little blonde skull!  I am happily in love with MICHELLE, not you, but MICHELLE.  Hate to break it to you this way, but you left me no other choice.</P>
<P>  ANyways, I have to get back to work on this english paper of mine, it won't do itself you know.  Later"

 Mmmmmmm, Mmmmmm, Bitch! I like you, alcohol is one<br>of the better things to be addicted to. The<br>only bad part is it makes you feel like doing<br>nothing and the next morning you get a terrible<br>hangover.

"event","<P>Today was the last day of classes (I still have my night class left- kill me now).&nbsp; But even better today was the day the bo bo crew made reservations for <STRONG>OCEAN CITY MD!!!</STRONG>&nbsp; I'm so excited, it's gonna me, kurt, marian, maureen, allie, bryce, and hopefully rachael (haven't heard for sure yet).&nbsp; We're staying that the lovely <A href=""http://www.seaspraymotel.com/index.html"">Sea Spray Motel</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew will be there too since he's living down&nbsp;there<STRONG> ALL SUMMER!!!&nbsp;</STRONG>bastard!!!</P>
<P>Summers gonna be alright, i'm gonna miss it here, i dunno, i have lots of friends at home, mostly my dance friends, my school friends are awesome but they are all really close with eachother, that's cool.&nbsp; I'm glad i'm workin at the CP center, i love it there.&nbsp; I'm gonna ask the Teresa if i can assistant teach at Bowman, I feel like i learned so much new stuff at temple that would be awesome to share with the students there, plus i need the money big time.&nbsp; I won't see Kurtie have as much :( :( :( he's living in Ephrata with his parents, and i won't be able to see him whenever I want.&nbsp; He said he'll come down every weekend we can get together so that's really good.&nbsp; OMFG I love that boy so much.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like summer a lot tho, it's so nice outside, i love to just drive around listening to good music with the windows down., and goin to the beach, barbeques, BLOCKBUSTERS AND GREG!!! lol&nbsp; But i wish i could still live away from home.&nbsp; I love my mom a lot. I miss being around her and all, but there's too much tension at home...it's too hard to fall asleep there...i just wish i had a place of my own back in the hill.&nbsp; I wish all my Temple friends didn't live so far away...I wish i liked living at home...with my mom and dad....okay okay i know i know cry me a river...this summer is gonna be awesome I can't wait!!!</P>

"event","If you ever have a friend on your friends list threaten suicide or leave a suicide not in their LJ (public or friends only) contact the Livejournal Abuse Team immediately. 

The Abuse Team does have more info on each LJer than most of us may have and can contact the users local police department and get them help a lot sooner than an LJ friend could if no one knows his real name or address... Abuse team handles these situations frequently. 

jessical, a member of the LJ abuse team says: file a request with the LiveJournal Abuse Team with *all* IRL contact info you have"". Sometimes people forget to do that, and in suicide requests, seconds count. A suicide request is usually noticed within 5 minutes of being entered into the abuse requests. At which point, generally at least 5 abuse team members start investigating that and only that. People are called on cell phones to be asked to get to a computer if possible, people are woken up out of a dead sleep, etc.

We work our asses off investigating the case, and as soon as we have a full name, address, etc., the manager of the abuse team (rahaeli) or one of us (I've personally called twice) calls the police in the area to give them as many details as possible -- method planning on being used if known [in case the situation gets violent], whether they're with parents or roommates or their own children, any other relevant stuff we may dig up -- and the cops then send out a car to the site.

Often, due to confidentiality laws and stuff, or just simple busyness, we never hear anything back. We all hold our breath and watch to see if their journal is updated again. Sometimes, we're reassured -- sometimes, we wonder forever.

And generally, across the Internet, if you get a suicide request, it goes to the abuse department, simply because we do so much investigating that we are the most likely to be able to connect words on a screen with a real-life identity.

Yes, harassment complaints may wait a looong while before getting addressed, but we recognize the emergency that suicide requests are. -jessical, quote from here

Unfortunately, it's not uncommon that people leave suicide notes in their LJ, but very few LJers know to contact the Abuse team in the event that someone on their friends list leaves a suicide note... can you each take a minute today to post this info in your own LJ to spread the word throughout LJ as for how to handle this type of situation. like jessical said, ""seconds count"" and contacting LJ abuse for a friend is what may may save the life of someone on YOUR friends list. 


***I am crossposting this info to several communities. Please do not get upset if you see it more than once. it could be the info that saves someones life."

"event","It's said that every relationship in your life at any given time reflects a previous relationship, or a relationship you have with your parents.  For example, when you were young your mother often expected you to be perfect and was always telling you what to do, what not to do, and putting you down for your imperfections, and you reacted to this by never speaking up and just putting yourself down and always trying to please your mother.  Now that you're older you have a friend who says to you, ""Why isn't your room any cleaner?""  You may react by apologizing profusely, cleaning your room from top to bottom and punishing yourself for being so imperfect.  You have reacted the same way that you reacted to your mother, but the friend wasn't scolding you or putting you down, merely asking an innocent question, maybe your friend doesn't have a very clean room either and wants to know why that may be.  Nonetheless, my point is that we often mimic our past with our present.  I can give every one of my friends, teachers, acquaintances etc etc a place in my past as if they were another person, but it's my reactions that I still have a chance to change.

PS...my mom wasn't like that, that was just an example lol"

"event","A proper man met a beautiful girl and agreed to spend the night with her for $500. So they did. Before he left, he told her that he did not have any cash with him, but that he would have his secretary write a check and mail it to her, calling the payment ""RENT FOR APARTMENT."" On the way to the office, he regretted what he had done, realizing that the whole event was not worth the price. So he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclosed a note: 

Dear Madam: 

Enclosed find a check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment. I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when I rented the apartment I was under the impression that: 

(1.) it had neven been occupied;
(2.) that there was plenty of heat; 
(3.) that it was small enough to make me cozy and at home...... 

Last night, however, I found that it had been previously occupied, that there wasn't any heat, and that it was entirely too large. 

Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note: 

Dear Sir: 

First of all, I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there is plenty of it if you know how to turn it on. Regarding the space, the apartment is indeed of regular size but if you don't have enough furniture to fill it, please don't blame the landlord."

"event","I screwed up a lot lately.  I dunno whats going on, you know your coming to the end of the rope when your roomates have to go tell you to wipe your blood off the wall out in the hallway.  I dunno if i should get stitches.  Maybe i should just let this gash fester as a punishment for my foolishness.  

If you're in a big hotel lobby and they start to play the ""Blue Danube Waltz."" Get the hell out, don't think, run.  If you're ever in a hospital and they page Nurse Flamingo to the cancer ward, do not go anywhere near there.  There is no nurse Flamingo.  If they page Dr. Blaze, there is no such person.  In a big hotel, that waltz means they need to evacuate the building.  In most hospitals, Nurse Flamingo means a fire.  Dr. Blaze means a fire.  Dr. Green means a suicide.  Dr. Blue means somebody stopped breathing.  If you're ever in the Hard Rock Cafe and they announce ""Elvis has just left the building"" that means all the servers need to go to the kitchen and find out what dinner special has just sold out.  In a Broadway theater, announcing ""Elvis has left the building,"" means fire.  In a grocery store, paging Mr. Cash is a call for an armed security guard.  Paging ""Freight check to Women's Clothing"" means somebody is shoplifting in that department.  Other stores page a fake woman named Sheila.  ""Sheila to the front"" means somebody is shoplifting in the front of the store.  Mr. Cash, and Sheila, and Nurse Flamingo are always bad news. 

It's all just babble, a bunch of words meant to mean something else, give other people hints and let them know that help is needed.  That there is a problem, someone is dying, someone is hurt, someone is committing a crime, they can't just go out and say those things, but they have to let people know some how.  So if you look hard enough, listen hard enough, you'll realize everyone is subtly dropping hints that they need help, or attention, or that someone is hurting them or doing something wrong to them.  Read between the lines, look for codes, and run.  Don't think, just run."

I wrote that I would work so hard, and do everything in my capability to become a stronger, healthier, and happier person.  I said I'd give it two years, I said that if in two years I was not complete, I'd resume my old ways, because it must mean that I was meant to be this kind of person.  It'll be two years from then in a couple months.  I'm not going to reveal what I've decided to do about this in the up coming months.  I have made a decision, however.  I'm sure that everyone will support me, which is quite comforting, however not needed.  I'm in control, safe, and happier than ever."

"event","Not every murder is due to a coke binge, not every murder is even a murder.  Not everything you hear you can believe.  <b>I can never forget these words</b>

The moment a stranger tells you to die, your first reaction is that you will actually die someday.  Then, after the stranger calls you a bitch and tells you to die once again, you wonder how soon that day will come, and if you should fear it.  You begin to wonder about the importance of your life, if random people are approaching you and telling you they wish you to die, it can't be that big of deal.  You start to think that maybe if you did die, maybe <i>then</i> that person would feel bad.  You start to picture the stranger watching the news laughing with her friends, suddenly she stops, she sees your picture on the screen, it's a photo from your senior year that your mom gave to the TV stations.  Your parents sobbing explaining that their daughter was told to die, so she did.  You erase those thoughts, place them on someone else.  You start to think about if the stranger told someone else to die, if you'd agree with them.  Or if you'd be like the stranger's friend and just stare back at the other person apologeticly.  The words resonate through your body.  ""Die, bitch, Die."" The last ""die"" trails off as if there was a piece of string pulling it to form a lump in your throat.  You press your head against the window of the bus, look out into the slums and the ghetto, trash everywhere.  How important can life be?  What's the point?  

Then, when your just about finished with your life, hopeless and planning how it should go, it's time to get off the bus, and you see the stranger again.  Only now she's standing.  She is no higher than your breast.  She can't even weigh more than 100 pounds.  She's laughing loudly and obnoxiously with her friends.  Suddenly she seems unimportant, frail, and weak.  She must have some sort of Napolian Complex.  She runs around telling people to die, leaving them thinking horrible thoughts about life, because she's afraid that the rest of the world that towers far above her may hurt her.  Everyone else in the clouds, the stranger at our feet.  Then, finally, you realize that you are equal to her.  You both are the same children of God, made the same exact way.  Blood running through both your veins and arteries.  Thoughts and impulses surging through your nerves.  Your bodies are merely a composition of neurons, synapses, tissue, and fluid.  You're just objects.  One is an object of fear, and one of compassion, but equal.  You realize that you want to live as long as humanly possible.  You run up to your boyfriends room.  You kiss him and make love to him.  You're the happiest person alive.

After that you really couldn't sleep.  You just lay in bed with him, thinking about everything.  Everything.  The colors of blue seeping through the window forming pink shadows on the wall.  He's a gray form holding you, like a photograph in a newspaper, and so are you.  Your two figures wrapped up in eachother, a beautiful mess of tangled limbs and covers.  Cotton and flesh all mixed together.  You think that your so high- 10 stories high.  You think about the 10 floors below the two of you.  You picture other couples making love, fighting, watching TV, reading, some old guy jacking off, maybe someone doing a line, or shooting some intoxicating, mind altering chemical into his arm, maybe at that moment someone right below you, contracted aids.  For a moment the world is huge.  You hear every sound in the world.  It's a buz, it sounds like a million frogs croaking at all different times, all different tones.  Earth is a busy place.  We are all so tiny.

Now you know for a fact I'm crazy..."

"event","Sigmund Freud proposed that the human psyche could be divided into three dependent parts, with the <b>id</b> being the first.  The id consists of amoral, irrational, driving instincts for sexual gratification, aggression, and general physical and sensual pleasure.  This is what we are born with, nothing about the id is learned.  It's pure.  Natural.  Instinctive.  Innocent.  Self-loving.  Satisfying.  Impulsive.  Raw.  Selfish.  Greedy.  Glutonous.  Dirty.  Wreckless.  Dangerous.  

The id doesn't care about reality, about the needs of anyone else, only its own satisfaction.  If you think about it, babies are not too considerate of their parents' wishes.  They have no care for time, whether their parents are sleeping, relaxing, eating dinner, or bathing.  When the id wants something, nothing else is important.

Crying, kicking, screaming, wailing, to get what you want.  Food, attention, emotional satisfaction <i>whatever you want.</i>  And this is all perfectly normal.  A natural part of our psychological development."

"event","The pyramidalis nasi muscle originates in the fascia of the nasal bone and upper nasal cartilage, runs through the area of the root of the nose, and fans upward to insert in the skin in the center of the forehead between the eyebrows. It acts to pull the skin of the center of the forehead down, forming transverse wrinkles in the glabella region and bridge of the nose. This horizontal wrinkle at the root of the nose is sometimes referred to as the ""champion pucker"" because this muscle often contracts in effortful activities. It usually acts together with corrugator and/or orbicularis oculi and/or the nasal part of levator labii superioris. It is very difficult to contract deliberately without involving these other muscles.

Women and even men spend millions and millions of dollars on plastic surgery, botox, and cremes to reduce the appearance of wrinkles in the forehead and between the eyebrows.  The actual medical term for wrinkles is rhytides.  The less a person smiles, puckers, sneers, frowns, etc, the less a person will have rhytides, the less a person will show true emotions, the less money a person will spend on decreasing the appearance of rhytides.  

Why is it that wrinkles are thought of to be so ugly?  Why is everyone so obsessed?

Wrinkles, rhytides, laugh lines, crows feet, marianette lines etc are a person's history.  A timeline of facial expressions.  An art gallery of one's inner self.  One's feelings.  One's past.  Wrinkles are like seeing someone inside out.  You see what a person keeps in.

Everything we do exposes ourselves.  We can never hide the truth from anyone.  People don't notice things like rhytides, facial expressions, scars, bruises, body language.  Maybe the notice, but they don't pay attention, don't think about it.  People don't pay attention to the things that give them tangible proof of a person's secrets.  Maybe some people do.  <b>I do</b> but most people don't.  Even the people who think they know you the best, they don't notice the diary that's written all over your face.  Your biography is covering you, and you can't escape it.  People don't notice though...

They could be the shadow of something moving outside the cave.  They could be the shadows of people chained next to us.

Maybe the only thing each of us can see is our own shadow.

Carl Jung called this his shadow work.  He said we never see others.  Instead we see only aspects of ourselves that fall over them.  Shadows.  Projections.  Our associations.

The same way old painters would sit in a tiny dark room and trace the image of what stood outside a tiny window, in the bright sunlight.

The camera obscura.

Not the exact image, but everything reversed or upside down.  Distorted by the mirror or lens it comes through.  Our limited personal perception.  Our tiny body of experience.  <b>Our half-ass education.</b>

How the viewer controls the view.  How the artist is dead.  We see what we want.  We see how we want.  We only see ourselves.  All the artist can do is give us something to look at.

""Everybody knows you don't name crabs Raoul."" Kurtis Aaron Sensenig



Last night was really great at Kurt's he wasn't high, he was just himself.  When he's not high he's so funny, so affectionate, and so smart.  I really love him so much.  I don't understand why he smokes so much.  It's really disapointing.  He said he won't smoke around me anymore.  I hope he knows that he can't just call me and be like I'm not high anymore so you can come over now, because that won't work either.  I'm not waiting around for him, and last time he did that I got there and he was still completely stoned.  It hurt me so much...he acts like I'm nothing when he's high, he laughs at things that aren't funny, he doesn't make sense, he doesn't hold me as much or kiss me as much or look into my eyes.  It's horrible, because I know he's so much better.  Then I looked at Allie and Bryce, and Bryce stopped smoking almost completely mainly for her, I know Kurt loves me, but why doesn't he love me enough to do the same.  If I was doing something that bothered him, I'd stop.  I won't get upset over it now, because besides the other night, he's been sober most of the time, and when he's sober he's absolutely perfect.  I love him.

So far I've had four of my classes.  Yesterday my first class was at 11:40- Movement Improvisation.  It was pretty cool we did improv with partners and large groups, but improv involves so much confidence and risk taking ability, and I need to really improve on that.  Then at 1:40 I had Movement as a medium.  I like the teacher, she's really nice and really down to earth, whereas my improv teacher- Marian Soto, is really strict and demanding.  I think Movement as a medium will be only a little challenging, but I'll learn a lot.  Then today at 8:40 I had ballet with Tim.  I had my audition for Temple with Tim, so I already new I would really like his class.  I had his ex-wife Miss Lena at Bowman, as well.  He paid a lot of attention to me and gave me really good corrections.  We do a lot of calesthetics in his class which is good, and he has a strong focus on technique which I really need to improve since I lost a lot of technique because my ballet class last semester was focused more on terminology, composition, and structure.  Then I had modern with Kun-Yang, who I LOVE!!  He's so graceful and has a really strong ballet influence.  I was really happy because he knew my name and I never even had him before!!  His class had even more calesthetics so I'll definitely be sore tomorrow.  I'm happy with all of my dance teachers and dance classes so far.

I have Intellectual Heritage at 2:40 and math at 5:40, and hopefully they'll be just as good as my dance classes- however highly unlikely.

All of my academic classes are at Curtis hall, which I find quite ironic being that my boyfriends name is Kurtis. Rahahahaha.

I miss you raoul, I'll never forget the summer I spent with you, and the days I longed for you while I was at college.

It was really good to be alone with him for the whole night.  I love him so much.  On the drive home I was thinking about how it's so wierd to finally have what I've wanted all my life.  I never ever thought I'd have a ""real"" boyfriend, let alone one like him.  I hope I'll never feel lonely or mistreated again, and as long as I stay with him I know everything will be fine.  I really just can't believe it.  

Today I'm going to the cranberry inn with my family and my mom's family to have some dinner together.  Not looking forward to it exactly.  I'd rather watch the game with Kurt or something.


Yesterday I went to ballet at Bowman.  I got the stupid idea to go to the gym first and so I was late and tired.  I don't know what I was thinking.  My membership at the gym is over on Wednesday and I feel like I have to go there as much as possible until then because I don't know what I'll do once I can't go there anymore.  Once I'm back at school i'm definitely going to the gym everyday.  I hope I can find a similar routine there, beause they have different machines.  Anyway dance went pretty good.  It just doesn't feel the same as it used to.  I don't feel so passionately about it anymore.  I just feel like i enjoy teaching at the Cerebal Palsey center more than I do dancing.  It might just be a phase, and probably once I go back to school and start dancing everyday I'll feel the way I used to again.  I know I could switch majors.  I'd either be a psych major or special ed.  If i was a psych major I'd be a therapist for people who have suffered trauma or abuse and eating disorders.  If i was a special ed major I'd pretty much be doing what i'm doing now.  I just want to graduate in four years.  I wish I still felt the same way about dance as I used to.  Once I got to college and all of the sudden dance wasn't just for fun it was something I HAD to do for a grade it kind of took the passion out of it and made it feel more systematic.  They say that not everything you love you should make a profession out of.  I really don't know what to do.  I'd let so many people down if I quit.  I suppose I could still be a dancer and not be a dance major.  I mean you really don't need a degree in dance to get into a company...you just need to be good.  Being good means taking classes everyday...if I had money I could take class everyday somewhere else like Koresh or something and still maybe get into a company.  If I had money...

It sucks having to make grown up decisions like this.  It especially sucks when emotions are involved.  I feel like if I switch majors everyone will be disapointed in me.  I don't want to be a quitter.  I'm not quitting because it's too hard, I'm just starting to feel like dance is a selfish profession.  I mean it brings enjoyment to the audience, but it's not helping anyone.  Being a special ed teacher or a therapist would be really changing peoples lives and bringing them to places in there lives that they couldn't be on there own.  I love dance and i want to dance forever, but maybe I'm beginning to feel like other things are more rewarding.  this sucks...

One week till school, i'm really missing everyone.

""the mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven"" 
-john milton, paradise lost

All that is gold does not glitter, 
Not all who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither, 
Deep roots are not reached by frost 

""I am the sum of my parts and infinately more so, the hum of my brain, the curve of my torso. I'm the spark of my wit and the depth of my heart, size is no measure for such a work of art""

""An ocean of sadness often borders the shores of paradise. Keep swimming and you'll make it""

""The body says what words cannot""

MOST IMPORTANTLY:
The longer I leave this mask on, the more it will hurt to take it off

and

I could never be here, unless I'd been there first.

"event","Christmas Eve and Christmas were GREAT!!!  Christmas eve we went to Church and saw the children's choir and they were so cute because I love little kids and they were all just sitting there picking their noses, not knowing any of the words to any of the songs, thinkin about santa and all the gifts they'll get the next day.  

Then we went to Aunt Mary's and my mom, dad, and I talked with David and his wife almost the whole time about their trip to Disney World.  It was a nice distraction from the things I didn't feel like dealing with.  Ellen was there and I kept comparing myself to her.  She looked so much better than the last few Christmases.  She was so healthy and obviously taking good care of herself.  I'm glad things are getting better for her.  I hear she has a boyfriend and might go to college in Georgia next year, that's good, Perhaps she needs to get away, and now she has a male in her life, which she really needed since she was young.  I was a little jealous at first to see her taking such good care of herself, but  I realized later she may have been jealous of me for the opposite in previous years.  She seemed to be avoiding me the whole night, I guess she was a little embarassed...if she only knew that I looked up to her and was happy for her....

Aunt Mary was so thankful for the cookies I baked her and she kept saying how generous I was!  Yay!  She gave me some lotion, this santa thing, and twenty dollars for christmas.

Then before we knew it, it was christmas morning!!  The three of us had breakfast together and opened presents and had a fire.  My parents really liked the presents I got them.  I got lots of clothes and a discman and some other things from santa...I still haven't opened anything in my stocking because I always save it and open one present eachday after christmas.

Then we went to Gracanne's for brunch.  They got the cutest dog named Charlie brown and it was so nice and playful.  Christa came with her BABY!!!  Julia-anna was so precious and beautiful, but she looked so fragile I was too scared to hold her, despite the many offers.  Then we got news that Sharon's baby, who's been really sick in the hospital, finally woke up from her induced coma!!  She's only five weeks old and they said it was as if she had just been born.  Everyone was crying, but I forget how. Then we opened presents, Gracanne got me some clothes and a hat scarf and gloves set.  She's the best person to get for polyanna, and some how i always get her!  Woo hoo...one time i got aunt sally and she got me like sand or something

Then we went to Granpop's for dinner.  Fried turky...yuck...i forced a few pieces of the fatty greasy bird down my throat, but the thought of it kind of grossed me out.  Then we opened presents.  Aunt Jeanne got me a diamond necklace!! And she didn't even know about the earings Kurt got me!!  It's three diamonds, one for yesterday, one for today, and one for tomorrow.  The one for today is the biggest...hopefully it will help me remember what's important.  Aunt Dorothy got me a 50 dollar gift certificate to Old Navy and her dog, ralph, gave me twenty dollars!  Grandpa gave me the best presnt though- the Chi Hair Straightener that I wanted, and he even gave me forty dollars on top of that!!  My mom got Grandpa tartar sauce.  I don't know why.  Then dessert, and then we went home.   

Today I woke up around 12 and now I've got a lot to do around the house and I think I'll go to the gym for fifty hours to work off yesterday.  I want to go to Kurt's tonight, but I guess he's not back at his apartment yet.  I'll call him and find out.

"event","It's wierd yesterday was so rough and I went a little crazy, but today I woke up and actually went to my math class that I haven't been to since october, and I even stayed awake and took notes.  Then I had Modern class and I even wore really nice dance clothes and I tried really hard.  Phil made the freshmen dance majors take Marian Soto's class because we'll have her for Improv next semester and it was so much fun.  It made me remember why I love dance because we just got to be free and let loose.  After ballet and dance 10 yesterday I just about quit dance forever...Then after my class I took a shower and did my hair really nice and put nice clothes and actually attempted to look attractive instead of just beating myself up all the time for lookin like train wreck all the time.  Then I did a lot of research for my research project for english.  I got ten sources and they're really good.  Then i went to English and I was even on time for once, I dosed off a little, but the Prof didn't notice cuz we were watching a movie.
Then I cleaned my room really good and organized all of my notebooks and papers and figured out what I have to do for the next couple weeks and wrote everything down on my sweet new ""day planner"" my mom got me.  Then I did even MORE homework.  
In a little bit marian and I are going to Old Navy and I'm gonna treat myself to some winter clothes because I don't have any and my mom and dad gave me a lot of money yesterday.  It's actually true though, I have no winter clothes...it was pretty nice when I had no choice about what I wore last year...but i'm excited to get some nice stuff
Then we're pickin secret santa's.  I'm so excited to surprise someone with a present.
Then I'll probably go to Kurt's place...yay!!  
Thank god today was a good day, I might have hid in my bed all day if one more thing went wrong.

"event","Yesterday I went to Kurt's house in Ephrata, PA and met his perfect little family in his perfect little town.  It was soooo nice!! His mom was so sweet and his dad was so smart, and everyone was talking to me and interested in what I was doing.  The food was so good, and his house was so nice and wholesome.  Everything was so clean and organized and decorated.  We rented a movie to watch on his TV in the basement on a bucket, but i kept falling asleep.  It was so nice to just lie in his arms again.  Except for when he punched me in the face.
After dinner his uncle drove us to the train station and we took the train home.  It was fun to ride the train home with him because he always cracks me up.  Then we hung out at his apartment together and it was really good to be alone, just the two of us.  I wished I could spend the night there but I had to get home.
Then, we went to get my car and I was so worried about it being towed but when i looked at it...the lights were on and I was like wtf are the lights on for, I didn't have them on this morning, then we got closer and I realized it was running.  stupid me left the car running all day with the keys in it and everything-- for 12 hours straight...and no one stole it!!!  I still can't believe it.
Then i got really lost coming home but Gen's mom helped direct me back.  Then I went to Gen's and Kim was there and I didn't expect to sleep over but i put my head down for a second and it was 9:30 AM...so i took kim home around 11:30 and now i'm back home, I have to write a few papers and pack up and hopefully I'll be back to school after dinner time...i can't wait to see everyone!!!"

"event","Well it's not as bad as I thought it would be, after tonite and last night i'm even startin to miss old times.
Thanksgiving dinner was at my aunt gracanne's.  My dad's side of the family is insane.  His sister did a really good job at dinner and got everyone little presents and stuff and she wanted to say grace and have everyone sit together but it didn't really happen how she planned but her husband, Uncle tom, is like a lunatic, but surprisingly he was alright and he told some funny jokes.  My cousin thomas was, as always, really entertaining, he has like the severist case of ADHD on the planet, and he was like riding this little toy pony around all night and like playing classical music, he like loves classical music, lol and he's nine years old. Then my whole family got really drunk and I snuck out and went to gen's again for some more craziness.  We went to blockbusters at like 11:00 and greg was there but he wasn't our cashier but the guy we had was just as bad, omg we def could not control our laughter...drugs are bad man...lol he was like ""DRIVE SAFELY"" lol i'm surprised they don't call the cops cuz we go in there and we're rippin movies off the shelves and throwin' them at eachother and then we're actually falling on the floor laughing and then when they see the movies we're renting it's rainbow brite and the little mermaid lol
Then at like 4am when the craziness was dying down and everyone in the house was passed out gen kept falling asleep so i had to pounce on her to keep her from sleeping.  lol she may have cracked a rib but she didn't fall asleep till the end of the movie thanks to me.  Then we finally passed out and she had to get up at like 7 to go the mall with kim and nina, but i stayed in her bed because i was done for, then i left her house at 9:30 and her mom who thought i stole her sweater but it was realy mine, was like the wtf are u doing here lol
So i came back home and made breakfast and did some yoga and took nap.
Then i went to kim's house and her two miniature pinscher's ate me alive even though they're practically the size of my toe.
Then kevin called and said everyone was going into the city to go to cosi's for some beverages just like old times.  So i drove down to L-side to pick him up and I was like not scared this time cuz i live in the ghetto and it's far worse then l-side so i was all brave, but then i noticed some asshole was ridin my ass, so i tried to loose him and switch lanes but he kept on following me, then I turned onto Kev's street and he was still behind me, I started freakin out so i pulled into some random driveway and he pulled in right next to me, i don't think i've ever pulled out of a driveway so fast in my life, but luckily once i got to kev's house he was gone...i was so scared i could barely drive to sandy's.  Me and kev were talkin and it was just like old times back in highschool when we used to always be in the car just the two of us and talk about everything it was good times.
Once we got to sandy's ryan was already there, and he had his mini-mohawk and i was so glad he didn't change or get any less gay...lol and sandy even heard me when i said i wanted something to drink.
Then Val, Michelle, Lil Megan, John and Sarah came and we started to leave and there was Danielle and Natasha.  I was so glad I got to see them.  Danielle looked really great and she had her tongue pierced, but everyone had something pierced except me..i need to get something pierced now.
THen we went to philly and it was like pouring and we almost died a few times but it was fun cuz i made kev drive cuz i was scared.  Sandy was gettin raped and fondled by ryan and john in the backseat and she was squealin' like gonzo just like she always used to.  Then we got to cosi's and did our thing and talked bout old times.  Then we went to the bookstore and looked at magazines with naked men, but i was the only one lookin at the magazine with naked grandpa's.
Then on the ride home sandy was talkin about some crazy ""jingle cats"".  She said it's like a choir of cats that sing christmas songs.  And everyone was like shut up your so stupid cats can't sing.  She talked and sang about it the whole ride and we all thought she must have been trashed, but then when i came home she imed me the website and it's true.  They have cd's and concerts and everything.  Poor sandy we always think she's a stupid head, but she knows her animal stuff...and her cartoon stuff...and her saved by the bell stuff.
Then we all said our good byes and I took kevin home and Val, John, Sandy, Meg, Sarah, and michelle went to tabernacle to see a ghost or something but kev had to be home cuz his dad is the worst man alive, and I wanted to get home and get my beauty sleep cuz i see kurt tomorrow and his family and i wanna look my best.  I'm so excited.
I almost wish that I didn't have so much fun with all my old friends the past to nights cuz now I'm gonna miss them and miss doing all of our crazy stuff, but I really really miss everyone at temple too...and it's not like we don't do crazy shit at temple lol...I can't wait to see the Bo BO crew on sunday.
Things are good right now (finally)...maybe I'll start doing good in school too...lol"

"event","It's 3:30 and I'm supposed to go home in a few hours, but I'm not even packed, I really don't want to go home, but there isn't much use to stay here all my friends are gone and campus is dead.  I'll miss everyone so much this weekend.  I hope I can visit Kurt.
I deleted all my old entries because they were stupid and now this journal can be for people to actually read, because my other one was too personal.
I am excited to see everyone this weekend.  I can't wait to see everyone from dance and the ""SKRAD"" crew from PVI.  
Friday me and the Bo Bo crew went to the Olive garden and spent 50 million dollars on Kickass food, then we came back to campus and we wanted to go to Doobies B-day party at Pi Lam, but they wouldn't let chris, andrew, or Bryce in because they are boys and frats only let girls in because they suck so we ended up squishin' in a taxi and goin to the homeless bar, chris was dancing with a homeless man and he really seemed to like it, we got really really trashed and then came home, and I had to sleep all alone while Bryce and Allie made out all night because my stupid boyfriend was in Virginia...I missed him so much....that motherfuckin biatch
Saturday night I hung out with Gen and Kim, it was an unexpected get together, but I wasn't surprised about the crazy times.
AAAAAAAND when we went to blockbusters we saw Greg our favorite cashier guy.  We were like all loud when we went there and he was like wow where have you guys been and I was like college.  HE REMEMBERED!!!  Me and Gen Decided that when pirates comes out on video we're going to go in there when greg is working and getting the video but we'll be dressed as Pirates.  It's gonna be the ""grest.""
We watched orange county cuz they never saw it and it was some good times, but it made me miss allie...""YOU BETTER NOT!! YOU BETTER NOT!""
So i was glad to visit my friends and do our crazy shit, but it felt good to be back on campus sunday, then I went to Kurt's apartment when he Finally came back, I missed him so much over the weekend...he makes me happy...like the real kind...not the fake kind.  He took me to the waterworks and it was so much fun and he even protected me from the scary homeless man under the bridge, but I almost had to save him when he was being a dumbass and almost fell in the river, but luckily he is good at climbing and stuff because when he was younger and lived in africa he had a pet monkey.  My boyfriend is a wierdass...
Last night he said that he was gonna get the 10:30 shuttle to come to my room to see me, but I was talkin to gen online about my big boobs and we were thinking up nicknames for him (like Kurtius Maximus, Kurtled Milk, and Special K with berries)and I didn't realize that it was 11:15 and he still wasn't here, then gen went to bed and I started to get upset cuz i thought that motherfucker forgot about me so I lied down and tried to go to sleep so I wouldn't be upset, but while i was lying down he was iming me, trying to get a hold of me, because he forgot his cellphone so he couldn't call me to tell me to come down and sign him in, he's so smart, even when he's half trashed he thought to go to the library and IM me.  So he finally came over and we had a great night together cept he got mad cuz i kept slappin him across the face, but he's a bed hog so it's his fault, then we went to breakfast the next morning but there was no food.  But it was funy cuz he had Special K with Berries.  Then we went to the production lab or something so he could prove his genius to me about converting a movie from VHS to a CD, and he figured it all out by himself on this high tech program and I thought it was so cool and I told him how proud I was and that retard couldn't even say thank you, he was all ""you don't even know how cool/smart/great I am, because your a big dumb head and you don't kno anything about anything"" then he punched me in the face and told me I was a dumb bitch...he's right I'm so stupid.
Then he said he had to go to the writing center...so we went to tuttleman and sat at this table for like 15 minutes and then he was like this isn't the writing center, i'm going home.  So then he was so cute and he tried to find a private place so he could give me a kiss good bye cuz i might not see him for a while, but he couldn't find one so we kissed goodbye right there...i think it's funny he can grab my boobs in front of any random strangers but he won't kiss me in public that retard...damn, i'll miss him so much...he's the best boyfriend ever...really"

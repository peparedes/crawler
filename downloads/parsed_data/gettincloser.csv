"event","There are train tracks outside my window
and every night at ten o'clock
the train stops
it screams
to stop.

It blocks my way to work
back from work
I go around
take six more miles
and three more minutes
and wish I had left earlier.

That train is always there
when I need to pass.
It makes me go around
every time.

It stops me.

Sometimes I watch it
as it sits there
and I sit there waiting.

I guess I am waiting for it to start back up
for something to happen
for it to scream
and catapult itself forward.


_____________________________________________________________________________________________


There are train tracks on the hill
outside my windows,
and when the train rolls in
it rattles the panes.
It screams
to stopping. 
It groans
in agony.
It sighs
with relief.
  

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

When my cousin was younger
when I was younger
when everyone was younger

he would stop his play
mute the television
furrow his little brow
anytime
he heard a train in the distance

he would turn to his mother
his father
and I,
and a grin would spread
across his chubby face
his perfect child teeth
pressed together so tightly 
I thought sometimes he would break their enamel.

We'd leave the house
forget to lock the door
get in the car
and follow the distant wail.
When it would stop, we were silent with it
waiting for the signal.

We followed those trains for miles.
We'd find them on bridges,
race them from the road that ran parallel.
Sometimes we were stopped by them.
Sometimes we followed the sound 
all the way to the train yard.

We'd pull in and watch the train rest.
We'd sit there for half an hour,
an hour,
two hours. 
And my tiny cousin would just sit there
silently
and watch
stopped with the train.

And when we'd finally leave the train
he would wail like the train
from the pain of having to
go
all the time."

"event","What a fantastic, beautiful relief it is to know that there is an end to everything. 

I wonder sometimes if I'm taking some sort of cosmic exam. It seems as if I've had more people dislike me, have animosity toward me, resent me, fill in the blank me in the last four years than I would've ever predicted. High school was all about hating myself, and apparently college is about making people hate me. I suppose I have brought it on myself, though I feel like I generally try to do the right thing. Right is relative. Akin to wrong, as it turns out. They are incestuous twins producing millions of inbred babies to inbreed amongst themselves and create even more grayness in between all of the right and wrong polarity we wish we had. Am I supposed to look at myself through the people I disappoint, love, neglect, miss, dislike, resent, envy. Am I supposed to judge myself based on what little of me most people actually know? I am accused of selfishness when the same sort of selfishness is given right back. You don't know why. You don't know because you weren't there either. For the past or the disappointments I've had. But then again, what rights do I have? Sometimes (like now) I feel like such an angry person. 

Maybe I'm selfish for thinking I don't deserve to be walked on. Maybe I lay down for the taking. But it never gets easier to fight back because of how pathetic and terrified I am of losing - everything. 

I feel like I do a lot for people, but somehow it's never the things I should be doing. My reactions don't quite match up to the desires. Some people seem to like knowing that guilt is the one thing that will always pull a 'yes' out of me. And they use it. Over and over and over again. 

I'm dizzy from all the nodding."

Good-looking because people don't know how else to categorize you. ""Oh, that guy. He's hot!"" And nothing else. I hope you know that, and that it makes you cry. I hope you see how ugly you are, the way I see it. How that beauty you love so much is quite possibly the most hideous thing about you.

But those other insecure, beautiful people feed off of your standard. They want to feel beautiful so they put themselves up next to someone that has all that beauty going for them. You are a fragile, small, ridiculous individual. Mangle that face up, stuff that perfect stomach full of cow fat and what are you?

Done my reading. I don't know what to say to you or if I should say anything because words are useless with you and actions have lost the i.o.n.s. I've always felt that my words are silent and my actions spoke hardly above a whisper. I've always felt that I was coming up short. You're good at what you hate. You think I'm happier now. Well, I'm not. Forward momentum doesn't exist for me and I wouldn't be so quick to point the happy finger. I wish I knew what the right thing was with you. I wish things were easier. Even the difficult times between friends come easy, except for us. The easy times were the hard part, the difficult times were-well, crippling. Somewhere we stepped beyond action. Somewhere we settled into inaction. Yes, both of us. Acting. Theatrics. Not-so-subtle messages glossing over names to protect the innocent or something. We're both guilty. Both waiting to be sentenced. Waiting for the ship to pull up its anchor and either get on with it or sink to a history channel special. Sometimes it feels like we've reached stalemate and I get angry that it has all felt like such a game for so long. I don't want to beat you. I never did, but I'm painted red. We've both cut each other down. We both have the other's blood on our hands. I don't blame you. I know it's hard because it's hard for me. I don't know if you'll read this, but I know you'll know who you are. I don't know if you'll take this and file it away in a folder with the other evidence of my failure, of my inabilities. I don't know what I sought out to accomplish in writing this very not-subtle entry. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Either way, you've gotta know I'm not the forward-moving, forgetful prick you want to believe I am, and there's plenty in my life that your absence has missed as well.

-Truths and Questions-
1. I've not read much more than what my classes throughout my education have required of me to read.
2. Therefore, I am not the literary I may appear to be. 
3. I try never to claim to be such the literary because I realize my own shortcomings... invent them even.
4. I don't know what I'm doing most of the time.
5. I should draw more, paint more, make visual the words I am unable to put on the page here lately.
6. I am a chamelion.
7. I want to be the kind of person who is unafraid to be all of themselves to anyone.
8. I become extremely frustrated with how strict my social filter is.
9. I become extremely frustrated with how loose others' can be.
10. Because I secretly admire those who just don't give a damn.
11. Tact is necessary.
12. Right?
13. But so limiting.
14. Is it necessary to tell the whole truth?
15. Is it cruel to poke holes in it before you hand it to someone? 
16. Or is it considerate?
17. I hate that to love someone, I have to feel such extremes of paranoia and insecurity - at least sometimes
18. I love when those things are eased by the <i>one(s)</i> I love. 
19. I enjoy clothes more than I should.
20. And celebrities.
21. But what <i>should</i> I enjoy? What <i>shouldn't</i> I? Why do I let people tell me what I should and shouldn't ...?
22. I'm trying to catch up on all the reading I should've done so far.
23. I'm trying to figure out why I never feel good enough and why I feel so guilty."

"event","Three months ago, the sky fell down at the apocalypse. Into the wee hours of the morning, the pieces of black night steadily began to pick themselves back up and morning bleached the air white and blinding. The end had come and gone - and where one ending falls away, new life will replace it. I felt like I'd never lived before. I was born an adult and a child and terrified because I lacked the newborn fascination of having never seen such light and color - of having never lived. My life before still lingers. My life now feels strange, and I don't know what I'm doing most of the time or any. 

But the world began again. Everything feels like a version of what it was before. A world trying to recultivate by the example of what used to be, but knowing none of it will ever have quite the same feeling. The past brought the present and the end of the world brought a future I have no way of predicting. 

Let's live like we're the only two remaining and the world is ours to plant and ruin again."

"event","You ever watch a movie with someone you love? And it's this movie that touches you, fits you like home always has, but as the credits start to roll up the screen, this person turns to you with a completely baffled expression on his/her face. He or she says 'that movie was weird' or they don't even bother to verbalize an opinion because their eyes say it all. I hated it. And all at once, and it would seem irrational, you feel as if you've just realized that they have no idea who you are. What if you were watching this movie with both parents, a grandmother, and a sibling - and you look around halfway through this movie and they're all sleeping? Snoring. I'm talking mouths hanging open, drool puddles, the whole works. And you feel like you just laid yourself out on a table and no one's even looking. Everything you loved about this movie. Every scene and actor and subtle detail and musical score are lost on them. Misunderstood or not at all. Awkward silence follows. 

You ever feel like no one gets you anymore?

I do."

"event","I realized yesterday, in a state of lonely reflection, how much I enjoy sadness sometimes. I think it's nice to remember that I am capable of feeling. Of thinking about things so intensely. My life feels routine - by the book. I work for money that I'll be giving most of up for bills. When I'm not working, I do the same sort of nothingness because my energy is constantly drained. Something in the air in summer just... I breathe in and get light-headed from the thickness of it all and wish that it was winter year-round because of the clarity of cold oxygen. I like being able to see my breath. I guess if I need to be reminded of feelings, I need to be reminded I'm alive. 

I've lost myself somewhere in the air. When I talk to people, when I think or take a step, I feel like I'm on someone else's feet. I'm filling in. I'm temporary. These people are strangers and I get angry because they think they know me and that we've met, but they're so caught up. They don't see it when they look at me because everything looks the same. It's lonely to feel like a stranger even to yourself, but I enjoy it sometimes. Just to feel new again. Unfamiliar. 

I get bored with business, so I crave strangeness and solitude.

Ok, let me stop being all indieJenny."

"event","Batman was just as fantastic the second time, and my Dad really enjoyed it as well. So I consider my day fulfilled, though a couple of plans never quite made it off the ground. Sadly, with all the working I'm doing and what little free time I DO have, I tend to want to spend it alone. I'm such a hermit sometimes. I go through random phases wherein I want to retreat into myself just to avoid the possible drama and screwups that come with the social package. People disappoint you, and you inevitably disappoint other people - so there are times when you question whether it's all really worth it and decide to lock yourself in and do without the games for a while.

Then the lonely comes a'knockin'. 

Humans are all just schizophrenic. Phasey creatures, as I like to call them, and time moves too quickly. Change is the only constant thing there is. The only thing you can count on, which at times can really get to a person. Especially a person who so enjoys the dullness of nothing to do, no one to see and no obligations to make in order to maintain your hold as ole reliable. The fact is that no one can really be so predictable because everything is situational. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours - but what happens when the score's all evened up and neither of you wants anything to do with the other's personal problems? When is it okay to say no thanks and take the selfish hit and when should you swallow your own pride, suck it up and come to the rescue? These are the things I've been battling all year. After a life of trying so desperately to make everyone ELSE happy in my hunger to be someone anyone and everyone adores, I'm finally having to figure out that such a juggle is impossible. 

You can't trust anyone who doesn't have enemies, and we all hurt and get hurt. I'd be willing to bet that most of those labeled assholes or bitches for having broken someone's heart or 'screwed someone over' may have been doing the right thing for everyone in making such a decision. We're all sensitive and vulnerable and capable of being crushed by even the nicest, most well-intentioned assholes.

Goodnight."

"event","The air during summer has the tendency to fill my brain and lungs like a cloud of poison gas. It's thick and dizzying, and most of the time I feel light-headed. Others, I just feel exhausted - like the energy has been sucked out of me completely and I remain on my couch a vegetable. Just walking around outside is akin to trying to walk while submerged in water. Slow, arduous, and three steps take your breath the way a marathon should. But I'm being dramatic.

I do wish this season would hurry itself up already. Even with a job and a place to live, I feel stagnant. Something about school makes me feel like I'm going places. Right now I'm suspended.



I'm going to see Batman Begins again with my Dad. Wooooo."

"event","The morning was on fire the day I said it. The big bang. It should have been the end of all things because I swore to myself that the words would never escape my mouth in less than six months. But they did, and the water rained down in warm torrents. The moisture from its heat clung to my skin, then beaded up and washed away with the drops that pounded against me. And my words - those words - ricocheted through the thickness of the air and I could've sworn I heard them echo. I'd only whispered them - straight in the eyes because the words had to be seen. And I held my hands on either side of the face. That face, because the words had to be felt. Touched. Grasped.

The big bang. It should've been the end of all things. But it's only the beginning of the world because all memories before this detonation are fogged by the foreigness of being unable to think of a time when things weren't the way they are. With this face in my hands and those eyes. Locked.

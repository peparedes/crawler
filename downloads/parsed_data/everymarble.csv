while i was describing the parts left behind, it felt like i was talking about the most bizarre, violent, sexual, subversive film; a completely different thing from what we'd just watched. but i first saw it when i was, what... 9? 10? it wasn't, i argued, really that extreme. it was a mainstream movie.

"event","- i just opened my fridge and saw the bag of grapes that <lj user=tigerman28> and i bought two days ago when he was here visiting. i've never been so happy in my entire life to see produce. jeez. it was exactly what i wanted at the exact moment that i wanted it, and i had completely forgotten that they were there. miracle grapes.

- i just googled this kid i had a very brief and totally weird friendship with during my sophomore year at auburn and there were no results at all. at first i was kind of angry, then i realized that i was mad because he had thwarted my attempts to e-stalk him and i got a little embarrassed. and now i'm telling yooooou about it.

- holy crap... get ready for the deluge of photos that will be unleashed onto your eyeballs when my new camera gets here. (empty promises? we'll see.)"

all i can think about is that recent episode of scrubs where the infection glows green as everyone passes it along to everyone else, and what was it that i touched that glowed green? gross.

i need to stop talking to/being around people, altogether. i have a weak constitution. (i might as well take up intermittent swooning. i'll get a fainting couch.)
everyone i know is a big jerk anyway.

in my leave of absence from the LJ, i have been doing adultish-type things like working 5 days a week and making out with an accountant.

but something like 87% of my time is still spent being utterly ridiculous, so there's no real cause for alarm. on valentine's day it was seriously FREEZING, but a group of us went to a campfire program at fort wilderness and made s'mores. ridiculous.

"event","one thing that sucks about working with the company that i do is that most of the (not gay) guys have these terrible, super straight-and-narrow hairstyles. practically military-issue. like it's too much trouble to care what their heads look like, so they just cut the entire coif at about a quarter of an inch and leave it at that. even the cutest, most charming guys end up looking kind of douchebaggy.  now, i'm not generally the type of person that considers hair when... you know, <i>considering</i>, but great god almighty! 

perhaps i should've thought of this before committing myself to work for the only company that i know with a literal BOOK that dictates how people are allowed to look.

or perhaps i should leave stepford once in a while.

"event","i have a pet owl!

he doesn't actually live inside with me... and i've never seen him, but he <i>belongs to me</i>. i'm calling dibs on him like imperialization. i claim this owl in the name of her majesty, myself.

i hear ""hoo-huh hoo... hooooo"" every minute or two. but... i've developed an attachment to it. which is <i>adorable</i>, right? so surely you can forgive me for being an imperialist.

it's 2006. my resolutions are as follows:
1. be charming when i meet cute, funny guys. cool it with the usual retard-being.
2. organize <i>all of this</i> [imagine a sweeping gesture that arcs over my life in general]
3. listen to new songs all the way through before deciding that i hate them
4. there are probably more... relating to saving money and working out, but that shit is <b>banal</b> and <b>done to death</b>.
5. stop phoning it in and just be funnier.

"event","so it's christmas. it's also snowing here, but it's not sticking on anything because it's been raining for a few days. 

it's still cool, though.

my dad's watching a terrible nicolas cage movie (redundant, i know) with the worst dialogue i've heard, maybe ever. someone even said ""yee haw!"". but my dad's totally into it because it's about apache helicopters. you can tell it was made in the very early 90s because it co-stars sean young (wtf has she been in in the last 10 years?) and because it's a bold-faced rip-off of top gun. i think i just heard one guy call the other guy ""iceman"", even.

one guy: ""hey, do you like history?""
other guy: ""no.""
first guy: ""well you better start, cause we're about to be making it.""

WORST!"

"event","so this season, the thing that the populace has chosen to especially freak out about (besides missing white girls... <i>i'm looking at you FoxNews. wrap that shit up.</i>) is the use of the word ""holiday"" in place of ""christmas"" in public instances. 
i'm going to be honest: i don't get it. 

i thought i might poll anyone who comes across my livejournal... 
i know that a great deal of people seem to take issue with this phenomenon, but i honestly can't figure out why. i mean, i guess i have ideas about what it could be, but i <i>really</i> want to think it's something other than... you know, some kind of cultural supremacy... or even just the idea of ""tradition"".

so if it bothers you (even a little) to hear the word ""holiday"" used instead of ""christmas"", i hope that you'll comment and explain. you can also comment if you really don't mind the term, letting me know why you think it doesn't bug you.

thanks."

"event","<img src=""http://www.auburn.edu/~sulliee/peektores/closet.jpg"" hspace=""15"" vspace=""15"" align=""right"">when i was a senior in high school, i went to at least one local all-ages rock show every weekend. this was partially because i always had a crush on or was dating someone in a band, and partially because wtf else was there to do? seriously. (most of the time, obviously, the local music was altogether secondary to the socializing, with only a handful of notably exceptional bands.)

anyway, so i started taping the flyers for these shows onto the closet doors in my bedroom, which my parents thought was a totally not awesome thing to do. i don't know why i left them up, other than that i wasn't really here much after i left for college (by which time they'd become part of the decor and were mostly ignored), but there they still hang. a few have been ripped down in 'frightened-dog' or 'taking-the-christmas-tree-to-and-fro-the-attic-that-shares-the-same-door' incidents, but my display remains relatively unchanged.

in the next few days i'm going to dismantle it and put the flyers into a binder. this photo/post is for posterity, i 'spose. <br clear=""right"">"

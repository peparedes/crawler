"event","You would think of having a terrible month, you would get a better month next time, guess not even that is right? well its not terrible just bad. Im not doing a full uni course this year, I failed a unit two years in a row and cannot continue my HND, massive fail =(. Therefore, Im on a UCDP course which is 9 hors a week to get a qualification with the units Ive already done. This means more free time which I really dont need, I would love to have a full time job to fill it up.

Anyway, spending alot of time out of the house which is quite good and meeting all the new faces from uni this year is always good. Most of my time this year has been because of LARP, there are THREEof them, plus all the random rpg stuffs I do. There TTT (teesside treasure trap), UVLARP (uni vampire) and CiD (cities in darkness, another VLARP but with the newer system), lots of effort needs to be put into the characters because I havent started it.

What else? My birthday was Okay, no family (except my bro) to spoil it =) and had a nice evening, plus had the awesome CFC (chocolate fudge cake) from The Southfield....I need more.

Immquite annoyed I wont be going to the MCM expo or Roppongi street aswell, seems I have to go for second best, and thats going to harrogate to go to BOTB with rob, sorry to put you seconds but my reasons for going to london for myself is quite desperate though ill doubt you will fully understand.

Also, alton towers is possibly this thursday, should be a good day if theres no rain.....

Well thanks for reading, things should pick up for novembr it seems as Rob is definatly getting things sorted with DR'bs. See you all soon =)"

"event","Summer brings alot of opportunities, sadly they have all been and gone, now its going though the low note of a rather differant summer. I have to spend an uncertain month with my two best mates, Nick Ferguson and Robert Bland, two sensational guys that have really made the last year so very special, therefore being rock bottom means Im back with my usual friends. Dont get me wrong, I love all my friends but it seems everyone is popular these days and everyone have new friends to hang around with. I have a few new friends but I dont think we have really connected....if you believe your one of them, dont be hesitant to TALK TO ME, we will both appreciate it.

So back to what to do for a month, because by that time Uni will be on its way back and then happening will start to happen. Searching for a job has become fruitless and not much to do regarding uni, I just dont want to use this month just to play wow or some other video game which at the moment seems to be the only answer.

So, suggestions of what to do with my time is highly reccomended, if you wanna give me some input, Ill be more then happy to help you guys with whatever you want! well aslong as Rob is okay with it =)"

Well, this uni is almost over and this time, It MUST be passed and Im confindent that it will be. Im now treasurer of the RPG soc, I have a boyfriend, I have more friends, I have tasks to do to get things organised for the new year (this mainly includes LARP stuff, it should be going ahead ASAP in october!), I have won lots of goodies from WoW Tourneys, I have watched tonnes of anime, I have more and more DS games with lots of pokemon playing and other things which escape my mind. 

Things are dying down because of the uni year, but there are still many in boro that want to do stuff, YEY, Im always game!

I should get around to updating my profile aswell, its been a year, things have changes, lots of melon was ate."

"event","Ok, here im going to post whats good at the moment and whats bad: 

GOOD =)

- Parents away for 3 weeks, leaves me with walking the dog and stuff, but Ive got some freedom and the chance to have partys..........notice the word ""chance""
- Found some hidden albums, even MORE music to listen too, also got my hands on Super Eurobeat 176 and 177, good stuff. 
- Watched Final Fantasy 7: Last order finally, bu was disaapointed to find its just a retelling of parts of FF7's storyline, though it was really well done. 

BAD =( (Now this is where the list gets really heafty)

- I maybe a victim of an horrendous fraud : http://forums.shiningforcecentral.com/index.php?showtopic=9984&st=25&#entry277197
Just goes to show that doset matter how friendly or reliable a forum can be, there will always be the one who brings you down......from the looks of it, I may not be ale to get any of the money back, but im getting some help from the peeps there, and quite likely, citizens advice. 
- My Pop'n Music Arcade Style Controller from Desktop Arcade .com STILL hasent arrived, I ordered the thing on the 5th of November last year, yep thats over 6 months, if anyone remembers my old Mp3, that took 6 months also for a refund to be successful. Im going to inquire one more time, and if it isnt here soon, im going to ask for a refund. 
- This Laptop has a virus....AGAIN.....why dosent my anti virus ever pick these damn things up....?!?!  going to need to format...AGAIN. 
- Although Im catching up quick with my programming, Im very unsure that Ill be able to get my asaignment done on time concidering im not grasping some fundamental properties of C, but ill keep on trying, ive got till july, it maybe more then a month, but im unsure if thats long enough to learn what I need to do and finish the assaignment. 
- Then, theres three assaignment that need to be done by the end of this month, the grim part though, Ive hardly started any of them, the seem tedious, yet I need to find time to do them, I would do them as quick as possible, but after the last two assaignments needing resubmissions, I have to be careful. 
- I have to deliver newspapers on wednesday, thanks to parents being away, I dont mind doing them, I just need to time to do Uni work. 
- I need to get a job, too much spending, pressure from parents about rent, free time during summer.........and how im usually always unsuccessful in these things, its something im definatly not in the mood in trying to achieve. 
- Im missing some Dark eldar minatures I bought, this happened exactly the same with a wood elf command party I bought a while ago, I HATE this house as to why things just dissappear. 
- Utterly depressed by the fact that no one gives a shit about me, what im wanting to be doing or supporting me, but thats to be expected, I havent been completly sociable or empathetic the last few months, but its seems im getting a bit more ignored then I should be. 

Im sorry for the pessimissity of this post, but Im having good reason to and from what it looks like, its just getting started. Ive been taking ginseng recently as natural mood lifters but will they be enough to keep me from displaying a bad attitude, although, like usual, just hanging around people normally gives me a little lift aswell, I just dont like it to rub off on others. 

Well I hope you have a nice day, because i know its going to be a while before I, myself, are going to have one."

I have NO IDEA how much my brother owes me now, I buy him beer/food/warcraft and I dont get much back, hes needs a job soon or less I think im never going to get any of it back.

I have to do more uni work, therefore I actually need to BE THERE to actually get some motivation and do it.

Its been two weeks and I still havent made time to play the new PIU machines, whats wrong with me, Ive been complaining time after time thats there no PIU up here in north england, one comes and I dont go, its these annoying sleeping patterns, they hate me now.

Got myself a New Archos player, though splashing out all that cash for my own greedy self just makes me wonder if it would be better to give it to my parents who I actually owe money to, but again its that creul cycle that even if I do it, Ill still get it in the face later and they would never noticed I did anything to benefit them.

Oh yeah, need to get job applications sent off, I want more money and use this free time for something productive.

Sheesh!"

Yes thats how bad my sleeping pattern currently is, went to bed at at 4AM and woke up around 9PM..........

Therefore, Im just going to stay awake till my 9AM lesson and have a shower before hand, I shouldent be tired by then, I hope.

WIth nothing much to do, Just played warcraft to get my Paladin to 43, still a little bit to go, Im going to update Myspace a little also. I know I havent been on MSN much....too much warcraft.....=)

"event","Its been a very busy week and this has definatly been the biggest ""WTF?"" moment I have had in a long while. On Monday I recieved this email from Youtube.com: 

<a href=""http://www.geocities.com/justicanuk/photo/konami.jpg"">Click here!</a>

I dont understand there reasoning behind this. 

1. The full video itself is still available on youtube, why hasent that gone, being better quality, I could see it to be the first to go. 

2. My video is a tatsujin and very bad quality one at that, there are other on youtube that look just the same as mine. 

3. My other tatsujins are intact, there just the same as this vid except there not DoLL. 

Im still scratching my head over this and it increase the confusion of my already love and hate relationship with one of the most influencial video game companies ive been supporting. Im thinking of writing a short essay of my experiances with konami as I have been playing their games for over 20 years. 

Well, the busy part of ICA handing in is over, thats 4 lessons successfully done, all I gotta do now is practice programming more and more, I dont want to fall behind....

Theres quite a few words on forums about the national DDR tournament on the supernova in london around aprilish, lots of people have expressed interest so it would be good to see everyone again after I missed last years expo (and soon to be the midlands expo aswell). Als, Para Para Tourney in Febuary? What on earth, its extremely short notice and will it recieve a good turn out? Im curious to see what the rules are going to be like because Im not entering if we are using the scores from the game as the sensors aint 100%, Ill express that in the post. 

I purchased the cillit bang CD single on tuesday....go Jakazid =)

Also purchased and external 5.1 sound card for my laptop so I finally have surround sound for it, Machinae Supremacy never sounded so good =)

Beta Test on www.kyle-ward.com Im very intriged, went from 33% yesturday to 35% today, I keeping an eye on it and see whats going to happen, it could be very well be the next gen dance game.......

Now that thelast few days are over, I can start to pick up on WoW again, With BC, I created a blood elf Paladin, like usual, it get reported that everyone wants to play but it turn out there isnt as much as you think and the most unlikely people, for which I am included, actually decide to make one. They are an interesting class, even thier class trees are extremly varied within each branch. 

Thank you for reading and feel free to post comments."

Today I spent almost 12 hours on updating my website and then, doing a brand new website for a large world of warcraft guild, which me and my brother are currently part of. I must say Im quite pround of what ive done, its not a fantastic site, and the content is a little scarce, but its coming along very nicely.

If you wanna check them out, http://wisandcig.9999mb.com is the address and http://www.geocities.com/justicanuk/

"event","I find World of Warcraft to be a shallow place, but concidering its the big thing these days it seems I almost have to buy into it just to enhance myself esteem. Its not like I dont enjoy playing the game, I just find its a Step BACKWARDS for the future of video games, so I do enjoy it, but I would be so glad if it just disapeared and we could all start over on something new.
Anyway, this has brought me to buy a second WOW account and a starter pack with two boosters for the WOW CCG. The CCG I can sympasise with, but with a new account and several servers where I want to join several friends, looks like the time I need to put into it is horrendous, hence the dread of this blog post.<BR>
<BR>
Apart from that, wanting to go down to seaton carew but just cant be bothered because of the edgy reception of NL members, I dont know wether anyone is coming or going. We need a solid meet date......<BR>
<BR>
Also, my finances have lead me to finally be able to purchase my Pop'n Music Arcade Style Controller (its finally ready!) and that transation should be done in the next few days.<BR>
<BR>

"event","As with my last blog entry, I will show you <A HREF=""http://www.geocities.com/justicanuk/2.jpg"">this</a>, and you can see why its been a slow and monotaneous week, its a good thing that stuff happened outside of uni thats been good.

Ive finshed off uploading music and creating a little jukebox for MySpace (and other sites), so now me and anyone else, can listen to my current (and previous) favs anywhere where the net is available.

Tonight, Watched two films at the cinema, Accepted and Children of Men, both where good watches. Accepted was quite a typical high school film, not very memorial but it wasent boring like many others and Children of Men was actually very unique and hada perfect blend of a good storyline, good action scenes and a very well done set, I would wtach it again. For scores, Accepted 6/10, Children of Men 8/10.

Its 2:25, Id better get some sleep......"

"event","Being able to see your lessons online from home is a good thing, but I dont want this to be a frequent thing. According to the timetable, the same lecturer as yesturday has cancelled his lesson. The good thing is that I was late getting ready so I managed to see it get cancelled before I left. That means, if I was on time I would of went to the cancelled lesson. This annoys me in two fashions, first the obvious one is that im getting rewarded for being late, and I know Im good at that and dontneed to be rewarded, its a bad thing. The other point I already expressed, I dont want this to be a comman thing, the only good thing to come out of it is that the class work is available to me online so I dont need to go to th lesson, but does this mean I can just skip the lessons in the future, I dont want to and hope I do have to go in for the future just for the sake of keeping my attension on my schoolwork as I want ti get good marks for my degree, if I ever get to it.

@ the anicom last night, watched a very interesting series named Dokuro Chan, which I found to be most delightful and definatly spontaneous, I look forward to this and Samurai Champloo in the future.

So Im just going to sleep for a few more hours before I head off to RPG this afternoon."

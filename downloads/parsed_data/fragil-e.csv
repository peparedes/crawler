I'm so proud of myself that I can walk past the junkfood and not feel an urge to buy some for comfort.&nbsp;<br />I want to be around for Holly in the future. I need to take care of myself. And if becoming a health nut does it, then so what? I need to take control of a growing problem. And I plan to. So there.<br />I got to see my baby this week. On Monday. Yesterday. I drove down to visit her for her hour break. I was so happy! And so giddy to see her after so long. It was bittersweet. It didn't last long enough.<br />I want to see her again.<br />I'm glad her and I talked some things out last night. I'm feeling better with where I stand with her. I don't know. I lost sight of what I meant, and if I meant anything at all. So we talked it out. I'm not letting distance or people get in the way of a good thing. And if I need to stand my ground, I will. She wants to be with me and I want to be with her, and that's the end story. Happily ever after =D<br />Well I took those vitamins and I'm feeling kinda shitty 'cause they taste really bad. But all in the name of health. They'll help me out hopefully. Maybe see a difference. Heh.<br />I just want to get a hand binding with Holly... and be with her.

"event","<p>I miss Holly more than she could ever imagine. I can't stop thinking of her. I have her everywhere in my room, she's inescapable. [Not that I want her to be]. I just want to wrap myself up into her, and never let go. She gives me comfort. I've been seriously talking to her about a lot of serious stuff. I love getting to know her when she rants and rambles. I listen, and I understand what she's saying. But I'm also learning about her. And taking into consideration how she views with things and deals with situations. I'm trying to get her some help, but her mother just thinks she's a hypochondriac. Whereas, from listening to her, there's something below the surface that has been digging deeper. I love her, more than she'll ever know. And I'll never give up on her, unless she doesn't want to help herself, and I want her to be healthy, in her mind and body. Because I want her here for as long as possible. She means so much to me. You just don't even know.<br />So I spent the night with her on Saturday night at her new house. We slept together, and kissed until well into the latelate evening and earlyearly morning.&nbsp;It was wonderful to wake up, and see her arms around me, and kiss her shoulder, and her lips. Just to wake up to her was so wonderful, it put everything into perspective. I've honestly fallen in hard love with her. I don't know what I would do without her. I really don't. I don't want to turn into one of her psycho exes, but I swear I've really fallen hard.<br />So who knows what's going on tomorrow. Supposedly I might be hanging out with Adam and Randy. If Randy buzzes me and lets me know. I don't know though. I don't want Holly getting upset about it, because Adam and Randy are old old friends, from ninth grade. It's really no thing now. And it never was.<br />I talked to Tom a bit tonight. About his problems,&nbsp;and I tried to give him some advice. I should be hanging out with him sometime in the near future. He's always good company to have around, and I'm excited that he'd be the first ex I can maintain a friendship with, and strictly that. But anyway.&nbsp;<br />I'm bored, I need some entertainment. I'm sitting here listening to AFI, cuddling with Tool, contemplating writing a Sharpie design in my notebook, but no motivation to get up. Don't you love it?</p>"

I hate sounding like she confines me, because she doesn't. And I love her jealousy, it makes me feel loved beyond belief.

"event","Holly is moving today. [She won't be there until tomorrow around 1, living, though.] Today is just moving the shit. I'm not as depressed as I was yesterday. I think this will be good for her, getting out of this hellhole, and being secluded. I miss her so much already. And if we can get through this, we can get through anything. That's my thinking right now. Long distance is never easy, and it takes real trust to make it...and I think we can do this. I don't want us meeting anyone else. I want it just us, for as long as possible.&nbsp;
I've been talking to David again. But strictly as friends, because I don't want a relationship with him. I never really did. Do I love him? Sure, as a friend and someone to talk to and hang out with. But nothing more. I don't think he understands that's the level I see him on, and have always seen him on. I lead him to believe there was more from me, when there wasn't. I'm not interested in him LIKE THAT. And I should have never said what he wanted to hear, because it blew everything out of proportion. I was basically scissoring through emotions, and pulling him on a string. But I warned him, and I told him last night that's just what I do with people. People that I know like me and want something more, but I have on and off feelings towards them. And he doesn't understand how I can 'turn into' a lesbian in just a week. But it's not the transformation of a week, it's the transformation of feelings in a life. I have always been attracted to women, and feel comfortable being with a woman, and I value the relationship I have with one now. And I can see myself in the future with a woman, not a man. I do not wish to get married to a man, and have that life. David doesn't understand. And it's so much more than he ever could. This has been inside me for so long, and I'm sick of these games I play with men. They do not stimulate me anymore, they don't have anything that I want. And that is that. It's really not so hard to understand- I like women, bottom line.
I should get a shower and go somewhere, but I really have nowhere to go that I want to go...I'm so lonely right now and it's weird. Without Holly, what am I supposed to do?"

"event","Holly and I talked a lot today. About everything in our pasts, and present. I feel we're both in the same boat as far as mentally...we both have issues that need dealt with. Mine are more present... I'm depressed because of living with my mother and Gary and the issues stemming from that.
I'm also extremely upset that Holly is leaving tomorrow. I have no one now. I mean, I can be surrounded by a thousand people, and still be so empty. And that is how I feel.&nbsp;
And it hurts SO BAD when she says she was with Kevin, or Kevin called her, or Nathan called her. Or whatever. IT HURTS SO BAD. To the point I can't stand. I've sacrificed most everyone in my life for HER, and that little bit she can't do for me. Or so it seems. It doesn't seem like she's all that interested in letting go of Kevin, because if she was, she would have already. I just feel really down, and I hate being jealous. But I feel like me dropping her off...her excuse was tired...but I think she was just trying to make me feel better instead of just saying&nbsp;'I'm waiting for Kevin to come over.' I think that's what it is. I think he's over at her house this very second, and she's not doing anything about it because she doesn't care if he's there or not. She still cares about him, and being with me isn't enough to change any of that.

"event","I wrote a huge blog on myspace, explaining my lesbianism...past relationships...my mom's mistakes...practically everything plaguing me as of this point in time. And it didn't go through, and I lost it. Like, a half page on just shit in my life. And I lost it. I'm so unbelievably pissed off.&nbsp;

I'm not duplicating, it was so long... but the gist of it was more or less...:

My mom's mistakes turn me off to men. My relationships with guys turned me off. Even though Patrick was the only one who really treated me like a WOMAN. And how I should be treated. Instead of being treated like shit. He got me. But I just didn't want HIM. I wasn't physically attracted to him. And he was just TOO YOUNG.
And then I talked about Holly...about how she passed her drivers test and she said it so nonchalantly, like it didn't even matter.&nbsp;
I don't look for her and I to hang out today. I really don't. I have my phone on silent, too...because I just don't feel like talking to anyone, even her. Because I don't know what I can do to help her,&nbsp;to make her feel more than numb and stupified. It's like nothing matters to her. I guess it's the moving constantly, and her mother doesn't help. But she's so unattached, and it scares me.&nbsp;

I talked about some more. But I forget now. I'm kind of in a bad mood today. So apparently, Adam wants to have lunch tomorrow [if he wants to], and I would love to talk to him again. I kind of miss having something like him, without dating of course [even though we didn't], I just miss his wit, and him in general. We had a lot in common, and he was a good friend, regardless of juvenile shit that was otherwise. And Tom is supposed to call me so I can tag with him to fill out job applications. And I'm looking forward to that, and still having a friendship with him. I was going to marry him...he does mean something.&nbsp;

I feel like my life is stopping. That Holly doesn't want to be with me anymore, and she was the only thing holding me up. Who knows.."

I ended up in Frederick on the Golden Mile, turned around and went on I-70 back to Hagerstown....took I-81 to Walmart where I met my love for her break. It's her last night so everything is pretty emotional, and she looks to be leaving on Thursday. [As long as I have tomorrow, I'll be okay.]

I got grumpypants! He's this zebra, with his head chopped off, sewed up, with a purple heart sewed into his chest and held in place with safety pins. He has colored safety pins on his arms and safety pins and buttons everywhere. Holly made him for me, to remind me of her. [Even though we're not breaking up, I want something with extreme thought and care from her.] And I got a wallet pic of her...so now I can show her off to the world. =)&nbsp;
grumpypants &amp; willy forever....Willy is her decapitated bear with safety pins, duct tape, bones and buttons sewed and strewn all over him. We're matching now. =D

Patrick decided to be a loser and fuck with me, so he got what he deserved today. He makes me so fucking angry, and I hate him at this point, and I don't want to be friends with him for any reason whatsoever. He needs to grow some balls, and grow up for that matter.&nbsp;

I don't feel like I want to update my myspace blog...I don't feel like writing in it anymore. For some reason, I used to crave the attention of people reading my feelings and my life story, but not anymore. I like the air of secrecy this draws. But who knows....
I don't want Holly to leave, and I hope we hang out tomorrow, regardless of her mother. Who has a real problem with me because I'm dating her daughter and her daughter is dating me. And the fact that I'm a lesbian. I don't much care, Holly is 16 and can make choices for herself. And nothing, not this move, not the distance is going to change what her and I have.&nbsp;
I'm already going through serious withdrawal...what am I going to do? When I want to kiss her, who's going to be there? Not her. When I need someone to cuddle with, who's going to be there? Not her. She'll be a half hour-hour away in fucking Sykesville.&nbsp;
I hate her mother for doing this to her and to us. Even though we will be okay. I don't want her to meet anyone else. I want her to myself, for as long as possible. I can't even think about it, without getting upset.

I'm moving out of my mom's house to my grandmother's...at least until I get on my feet at college, and accumulate enough money to rent the apartment my uncle is building near his house. [Which already has the water line dug out]. I'm living with my grandmother for a month to get accustomed. I'm mostly leaving my mom because she's chosen Gary over me. And she won't admit her mistake. So maybe if I leave, she'll realize he's still going to treat her like shit. But she'll never have my respect anymore. She's let me down so bad. I don't care if I ever see her again. I hate her, and I loathe her. From years past, I thought she cared about how I felt. And her true colors really show through. Fuck her. I can make it on my own, I don't need her. I just need somebody to lean on, and it seems like my grandmother is there and my uncle and his girlfriend, Angel. I don't think I could make it without them there. And they have my best interests at heart, and they care beyond what my mother does right now. As much as she says otherwise, I don't fucking believe her.&nbsp; 

I'm head over heels in love with Holly. She's everything I've wanted and more. About David, who I can't stand, he's just fun to hang out with and get high with. I'm done with Patrick and his stupid illogical juvenile emotions. I can't wait until she moves so then Kevin won't be around, and hopefully Nate will go die. And everyone else that seems to be coming between us. I really want to be in this with her for the long haul.

God, sometimes I pray to die, and take away all of this. I have to keep telling myself things will get better and to be strong. But god it's so fucking hard. It really is. There's a void in me, that is numb and it's devouring me whole. Every day, it gets bigger. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. My life sucks, and is peppered with good moments. And happiness for a few days. I don't know anymore.&nbsp; 

I really am in deep with Holly, and I'm not giving up, because I believe her when she tells me she loves me, and that she only has eyes for me. But I can't help my jealousy. I keep it close..."

It's between good and evil, love and hate, beauty and ugly. I am one person, so small, so insignificant. But I want to be embedded in as many people's veins. I want to thrive, live and spread. I'm a cure, not a disease. I want to be a legend. An old old legend.
I miss Tom everyday. I haven't stopped thinking of him for a second, everywhere I go to try to escape him, I find him somewhere. He is not looking for me, he is not finding me. Maybe he his. Maybe I'm everywhere and he's avoiding it. I love him still, and it's been so hard to get over this. I can forget for however long until something is a reminder, and then it starts again...the missing, the wanting, the love, the care, the wasted emotions I'm exploding at the seams with. There is no other - he's the only thing I knew of love. He's the only one that held pieces of me, pieces of me I've held. I feel like I can move on, I'm just holding on. I'm still holding on. I won't let go.&nbsp;
There's this guy named Patrick that I kind of have a mini crush on. If Tom isn't going to be there for me, then I want to move on. I'm only holding on for so long. I won't let go of Tom, and all we had. But I need to let it go emotionally and mentally. It's not healthy. I can't keep wanting something that will never give me the time of day. To throw it all away, like it never meant anything at all, hurts the most.&nbsp;
Going to Harpers Ferry, trying to find my lost self, and only chasing him around...chasing him trying to get him back. To get his soul to see mine again. On Jefferson rock I sit and sit and wait and wait. I wait for him to find me, because my heart is him.&nbsp;
That's all it ever was."

"event","<p>After something so misunderstanding, Tom and I are no longer together. I can't seem to get over this. I don't think I can stop loving him, stop caring for him. I want him back and I want him to want me back.&nbsp;<br />I want it all as it was before we left each other. We gave each other everything. There's a void in my soul, that I don't think can be replaced.&nbsp;<br />I cry all the time, without warning. I feel so alone. I want him by my side. I want him to call me, to message me. Something. I want him to miss me. I want him, and us so bad it hurts to think that it could be over.&nbsp;<br />This is not fair. I can't do this alone.</p>"

"event","Mhm. Last Friday I gave my love and my passion away...to Tom...
I have been brainwashed. There is no doubt in my mind anymore about marriage, and being together. I want this. I want him, there is no other person I've met that completes me like he does. That fills me with undying passion, and love. There isn't a single soul that can do that to me like he can.&nbsp;
I love him.&nbsp;
He visited me at work yesterday...and it was so great seeing him after so long...
And then today he came and stopped by my house after he got off of work...and he held me while I was barefoot in the wind, in my pajamas, cold...I wanted to kiss him and never stop. I want to be all over him right now, the more I think about it....
And he told me I was beautiful.&nbsp;
I miss him. I think next weekend we'll be going to Germantown, hopefully. I won't get my hopes up, but I have to work Tuesday, Friday and Saturday...and it just sucks 'cause those are the days I have to see him. We'll get through this. Time is on our side.&nbsp;
I can't really think about anything else, because I miss him and he is all that's on my mind...I just hope I'm on his mind as he is mine...
I wonder. &lt;3"

I'm okay with this. What will be, will be. I just hope things don't change between us, and right now, things are looking good. 
I'm a little disappointed, sure, who wouldn't be? But we're just not ready. With us having jobs now, with us going to college soon. We need to get through this first and then make life plans. Yes."

He wants to do it right, with our parents blessing. I don't understand this now. I'm so fucking petrified that I just wasted $60 on something that won't happen. After all this talk. After every little conversation we've had, I feel like maybe it wasn't ever going to happen. That maybe I was just let around on some short string. I know I shouldn't feel this way, after everything that we say to each other. A part of me understands, and wants to do it right. And the other part is now in fear that he will change his mind completely. If he can change it about that, then I'm worried. 
And I don't know why I'm crying. I don't know why all of a sudden I'm doubting, but this hurts in the worst way.
And on the drive to Frederick, I just felt so helpless and defeated, like what is my point being here? Really, I would LOVE to know.
My friends are all stupid ignorant assholes that I want nothing to do with after today. My parents think I'm thrilled about my life now, but my mom noticed my lack of enthusiasm today. I resent my dad. My boyfriend wanted to marry me as of weeks ago and now wants to 'do it right.' Am I not seeing anything right? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?!
I don't know how long I can fucking stand it here. Maybe I'll just pack up and leave, see if anyone cares then."

"event","Tom has to go to Puma tomorrow for his orientation at 1 in the afternoon. Talk about fucking up plans. Yeah, I don't know if I'll see him now.
I will see him tomorrow. I don't fucking care. My mom wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow evening, and I'm just so upset and angry that things don't seem to be working out, but if this is what it takes, then I don't give a shit.

I just have to see him. It's my fucking eighteenth birthday and I'll be damned if I don't. I mean, we have all the time in the world I suppose, it just hurts...It really does I can barely contain myself right now.
There is just so much I want with him. My love is swelling to epic proportions, I'm head first...I can't stop falling, I really can't. I just feel like I need this, this is my inspiration to come full circle with my life.
He completes me in a way no one ever could. In a way no one ever has. He makes me feel like gold. And I melt at the thought of him.
He kisses me and it's like everything is where it should be, I'm so at ease...I'm a different person. I'm grownup. I'm serious. I'm playful.
I'm so many things at one given time. I am one person, yet so many. So many facets to this diamond...I am discovering things about myself. Him and I are a journey...it started at Fazolis and will take us where we want to go. It is what we make of it, our relationship. Right now, it is all that I can think of.  
This is my future, people. It is what I make of it. 
I'm so many people in one, I'm containing it into my being....my one person. Ashley. I can be serious, sarcastic, witty, funny, playful, flirty, a maneater, a hopeless romantic. I am one person. And these are the sides of me. I'm just learning how to contain it inside of me...
I couldn't be at a better place in life...the best place so far. Yes. I am...If I think my plans are being sabotaged, I'm mistaken. I am here, and I am with him, and we are together. In the end, everything will be where it should be."

I plan to stop in at Fazolis with him to pick up our W2 forms from Sheryl or whoever.
I plan to see a movie, maybe. And maybe pick out a band/claddagh for him.
I wanted to stop at a fancy restaurant for dessert, being as that could be my cake...but I won't have any money left over from other expenditures.
Oh well, always this Sunday when I get paid my last and final paycheck from 'zolis.

Which reminds me, I called CVS back and I have an interview this Wednesday whenever I decide to show up...with Craig the store manager. He doesn't have many hours for me, but he'll be leaving soon and once I pick shit up, they could need me on down the road...so I think it should be a good thing. I'm excited, I have work again! 

Alright, well, here's to my big 18...cheers to me...cheers to me and Tom."

"event","I am getting married in approximately 2 weeks tops. On my birthday, my love and I are going to the court to get our marriage license, which will not be valid until two days after, the same time it was issued. This Tuesday. So on Thursday at whatever time, we will be able to get married. Or whenever I can take off school to have it done. 

I am so anxious and nervous, and just ecstatic. This is life. This is marriage. There is no turning back. NO TURNING BACK. It's hitting me. My whole name is changed. Ashley Danielle Gardner. OH MY FUCKING GOD. I am so blessed. I really am. I don't even know what the fuck to think...my mind is whirling, it is not stopping. 

I will not listen to anyone's negativity. They can't break this down. They can't have what we have, in such a short time. This defies everything. This defies us almost never seeing each other again...this defies us breaking up in general and the fact that he never dates someone twice...it's a sign...so clear and vibrant in our eyes. 

All of this is within grasp. It's right in front of us. And we're taking it all. We'll let this grow...into a relationship, into an extraordinary thing. I am there for him as I am for no other before. I always will be. I want this. I want him, he is all I want.

He is all I see...My future is in his eyes."

"event","I am rereading Tori Amos's book ""Piece by Piece"", and for the record, I am beginning to agree with her division of the two Marys...between the sacred and the profane.

That Jesus (the Teacher) chose Magdelene over his disciples to share his secrets, that they did in fact, have a sexual relationship with one another. It just makes sense from The Gospel of Mary Magdelene, translated with added commentary by Jean Yves Leloup.

It's not so hard to believe. Maybe the Magdelene is who we should all be worshipping. Or pay attention to...she could give us what we most want, but the Catholic church has denounced her as nothing more than a prostitute, never analyzing history too long to say that Jesus even thought twice of her. I think he did. She is the sacred...

I just get it."

"event","Tonight was supposed to be me and Tom. But now he can't go out because it's snowing and his truck is too dangerous in the snow, so. Yeah, I'm just a little upset. I want to see him. I haven't seen him since last week. It's just hard.

And my mother makes nothing easy. I wish sometimes I could disappear. I really don't care what she says, I don't care how she feels anymore about my life. Tom is a part of my life, regardless. Why are people so cruel? Why are they so judgemental? I will never know, I just hope that if I ever become that close-minded, someone will grab a gun and kill me.

Today has sucked beyond words. I don't feel good about not seeing Tom. I don't feel great about my mother always speaking negativity to me about all of it. I don't care what anyone thinks. It's me and him. And that's it.

I guess I'll just take a nap and try not to think about it, I'll try not to wish I was somewhere else."

"event","The beginning of my new life starts now. I promise myself that. 

A lot of things have been accumulating for me...I'm going to college this fall to work on my Associates degree in Education. I'm turning eighteen this Tuesday. And the one thing that means the most to me..

I'm getting married to Tom probably in the next few months. A lot of people are extremely negative about this choice...I don't understand. Yes, we haven't been together but for two months, but you know when you're ready to start a life with someone, when you don't want anyone else in this god-forsaken world...Tom makes me whole. Tom makes me complete. I have never felt how I feel about anyone, to being in a year relationship, never have I felt this way. We have all the potential in the world to have a successful relationship and marriage. And we're going to take advantage of it. We want to be together now, so a real ceremony would happen later on down the road once we save...we don't know if we're going to tell our parents, because it would start a lot of questions. Him and I have all the answers. He is my future, and I see it in his eyes. I know that we are meant to be together. The way things happen just prove it to me...he is where I want to be. He is who I want to be with, for the long run in life. The ever possible divorce hangs over our heads, but we will prove to the world our love for one another, and that thought only pushes me more to help and make this wonderful relationship grow. I'm ready for it.

I don't ever want to blog on myspace again...it's too open and out there and I was a fool, really in doing so. Right now, with this journal I want to chronicle my college and Tom and I's life together, without anyone knowing about it. This is just for me. I don't want friends reading it and having their say, because it means nothing to me. This is my life...and like Randy said ""Live it the way you want."" I plan to do so."

"event","why is it that youth is so into showing their ""god free-ness"" all over.

whats wrong with God? whats wrong with a belief in it? 

why is youth today so adamant on being god free? 

I think its important to have some sort of faith system something to believe in. So its not God for everyone. 
but is there any real harm in figuring out your options are maybe giving god a try and not just saying ""i've done it my whole life with my parents"" 

maybe people should be more willing to break free from their parents religion and try god for themselves without adults or others shoving it to them. Without the pressure to conform to the business hell fire christianity and see god for the forgiving and relational god that he is.Maybe then They wouldn't be so determined to write off god.&nbsp; I know Christians have this horrible rep for being hypocritical and I have experienced that most of my life and at one point wanted nothing to do with god. but now I have found not all churches and christians are like that, I have seen the loving, forgiving, accepting me as I am, the ""I don't need to change myself"" compassionate, passionate, prayer answering, God. that has shown me, we're not suppose to be condemning others to hell but loving others no matter who they are. we all fuck up thats all there is to it. so why pass judgment were it is not warranted. why be hypocritical. as the scripture says "" why point out the speck in your brothers eye when you have a log in your own"" 

I think change is needed. I think we have to move past being hypocritical. People who do believe in God should probably that showing that christians not only care about others, but really don't want to pass their judgment. ( okay maybe its just me.) 

this is pretty opinionated and I mean what I say. but I also believe people should do there own research on spirituality and religion before diving right in (or out) of something.&nbsp; I truly believe we all need something to hope for and put our hope in that we can trust. If we don't what kind of life do we really have?"

a luxury I will surely not have


Depression has gone away mostly which is good. I feel like writing again I haven't enjoyed writing in a year. it feels so nice to enjoy picking up a pen and paper again.

Derek read two papers I wrote about him I was embarrassed he liked them He's house sitting for me and my mom this weekend.

Derek and I decided to take the kids there when Izabelle is three or after he gets back from Iraq. I love him.

He and jill and all my siblings plus tj(kinda sorta step brother) all went to the river yesterday it was fun. My youngest sister maggie (age 6) is totally in love with derek its cute. Then we bbq and I had two cups of coffee.

Why do I think of giving up dreams because I'm afraid I'll miss something else if I continue one path?

Why do I even consider such things if no other path presents itself presently I think of the future and cling to the words ""what if?"" something that is more ""right"" comes along making what is ""right"" now actually the wrong decsion and I should have been more patient and just waited. 

Why do I question myself so much because I know if I let go now, I won't get these things back.

My mothers warnings linger in my thoughts of my current life and soon coming future. 

Why do I feel like I have to choose between one life and the other? 
Logically I think I could very easily have both. Yet I continue to feel I'm giving up something for another. 

I frustrate myself. I'm anxious and stressed about nothing. 

I feel like I'm suffocating and everytime I feel like I've finally beaten this it comes swooping back in. Once again I've feel as If I've lost my control. 

I try to pray and yet it hasn't felt like my fears have been eased and I pray about that too. So I'll just keep praying. Its all I have."

-Derek and I. Good/great. We're both  happier now. I couldn't ask for anyone better than him. 
-Family. Blah, complicated and difficult. and divorced both parents in relationships and their people have kids. Meshing two new sets of families is complicated. Sometime I feel bad about my dad because we're drifting apart but at least we're not fighting. 

-School. Catching up, and bringing grades up. Hopefully I will not be attending RHS next year I pray and hope more than anything I will not be. Im ready to close this chapter of my life. 

-High school Friends. Are now more acquaintances, which makes me kind of sad. It is partly my fault because from Jan- march I kinda became a homebody. Its not all me and people are kinda upset that Im not going to prom I guess. I wish people would come to me instead of not coming to me about it if they have a problem with me though. Its not that Im mad at anyone at all I think we're just growing apart. 

-Friends are great I love all my new friends and old friends I love still having girl time and not always being with Derek on my free non family time. I love hanging out with jill and everyone its great. and going to shows again even. Basically all is good here. 

-Money is virtually not present in my life at this moment my family is broke again and so am and job hunting is not so easy especially in troutdale. Im sure some people can relate to this. Although I have an interview that may be promising i dont know I really hope it is. Wish me Luck


-Faith is getting better Im lucky to have found my church it has open my eyes and heart once again and I love being there Im really seeing positive changes in my life

- All in all Im excited to see my future things are looking up and Im so happy to found the people who are present in my life and support me. I am incredibly thankful"

I'm very blessed to have her. and we've both been through so much in the last year. and I couldn't image things without her. I can't wait till we get our apartment. She's my lovebird and we dont even have to be talking to be talking.

[Tamsyn] Has always stood by what she believes and has helped me go back to what I believe. One thing we have always shared is our faith.{except for freshmen year when I was hating it} She makes me want to be better. We have the same ideas and feelings when it comes to relationships and boys. we both struggle with insecurities in that area. But mostly because of previous expriences. and I love her for always being willing to listen. 

[Melissa] Who has always been one of my best friends since middle school we met because our lockers were next to eachother. She is agreat person and Im so glad I know her. Sometimes we dont get along but we always fix things later and its great. and I love her alot shes my wife. 

[Tyler] Tyler and I have always been able to talk and share things without hesitation and its good. We listen to eachother and he takes me out to dessert. we listen to music and watch movies. He's definatly one of my favorites I've known him since I was 16. and we've only actually hung about 7 or 8 times. but we still manage to stay in contact and Im blessed for that. whether he thinks so or not. 

[Hans]Definatly keeps things interesting we're pretty exciting. hangin out at his house with bbqs in the summer its greatt really. but now he's in texas and all we do is text but whatever thats what friends do. 

[Brandi] She is amazing really. We don't as much now but I know she has my back no matter what. I've known her since 8th grade I think and we've always been able to be friends. We have definatly had some good times. Shes not afraid to tell me what she thinks and sometimes its hard to hear but I know she's usually right. 

[kayla] who has been my friend since 6th grade also has been amazing we go to mexico together her brother adopted me and She is wonderful. We dont talk alot either and I miss her. 

[Derek] Is one of the most difficult people I have ever met ever. He makes my life extremly unbelievibly frustrating. And he has done so for the last year. We're not dating and we might never date. but we continue to see eachother. but he's probably the closest thing to relationship I've had since I was 15. we like eachother. besides being raped and my ex. he's the only person I've cared to sleep with. Although this may make me a horrible person. I care about him and says he does for me. And somehow its worth it. I just cant figure out how yet."

"event","I understand that everyone has them.
but mine have seemed to definatly increase and gotten worse.

Especially the bad ones.

stupid things seem to trigger them too which is equally frustrating. Like who gets upset about not wearing socks? 

I mean honestly?

and the bad ones are so much worse then befor. 
Like a big weight on my chest ( very cliche describtion but very accurate.)or like all I want to is sleep.
I find myself trying not to yell even at my favorite people. and not sounding annoyed or angry when its not even really that person

and then it leaves me feeling like I have no control.
and thats one of the worst parts because no control means Im weak and can be hurt."

""hi"" like we get along. ""hi"" like he knows me. ""hi"" like he did no wrong.
and I crumbled 
and smile like he thinks it's some kind of joke.

It makes me sick.


he doesnt have any right to talk to me.
He doesnt deserve to even look at me.

So No I'm not okay.
He makes me want to puke.

He shouldnt make me afraid but he does.

It's been two years and to this day it still impacts my life.
I wish he would leave.
I wish he would go away forever and ever 
and I'll never have to think about it ever again.


maybe its pathetic maybe its stupid.
he put me through hell. no one should treat another person the way he did.

no one should ever do that to another person ever. You just dont do that kind of things to someone. I hate Daniel Tingin I hate him with every thing I have.



and I miss derek its not fair and I hate him for putting me through everything we've been through. its not fair he always wins. I want him to hug me and tell me its okay and that he needs me still


I miss  my mom.

and my  heart hurts so much I dont know what to do. 
everything hurts I just hurt and I want to scream Im not okay.

Im stupid and pathetic and I hurt everywhere every inch of my body."

"event","I went camping at strawberry music festival at camp mather right outside of yosemite I've gone every summer since I was two. It is a lot of fun. in last couple years I've been hanging out with this kid justin, his dad, and justins friends and we had a agood time this year.
but they left sunday afternoon and sunday was the most amazing time I've had with someone in a while.

across the street from my camp site this kid had a campsite by the road and a fence it consisted of his car, a mat, a hammock and his bike. we talked sometime but that evening he asked if I wanted to go to the talent show with him so i did. and my cousin and sister went with.
patrick and I talked about movies because he watches as many movies as i do.  so we get there and some of em suck but this one girl was amazing.

then he and got dinner and talked. and then decided to share dessert. and go out to the lake.

we sat in the lifeguard chair. we had cobbler in a bowl and our fingers touched while we ate

we watched the stars he held my hand and pointed out constallations. we talked about our amibitions and the moon and light reflections. 

then we decided it was cold and got blankets and laid down on  raft on the side of the lake and watched bats and stars and kissed and cuddled and it was amazing..


it was nice to feel special and be the center of someones affection and attention.


he lives in nevada and we're going to write letters he's 21 and I cant wait till next year"

Here is the list:
I am sick of going to school with other kids.
because my peers sucks along with my reputation.
Thank You Daniel You bastard.

I am sick of my family problems.
Bullshitting around and getting no where.
Theres more to it.

I am sick of relationships.
I don't think anyone our age should be in serious relationships.
It's a big setup for emotional baggage and you get tied down some how whether you want it or not.
We have so much we could achieve and explore and learn and do with out all the shit. 

If you disagree which I know most people will argue this but I dont care and no I dont want to hear your point of view

Yes I have emotional baggage and yes I may be slightly bitter.
and Yes it's my own fault.
and Yes I may be looking at all this in an immature way.
But at least I know this"

"event","I think it's really important. no matter how much you may hate someone there should be a tiny bit of respect for that person.

I wish people were more respectful towards other people
even with what has happened to me I still try and give respect to people.
I know I have messed big time towards some people but you have no idea how sad it makes me to know that I thought I was more important than that person so much so I thought they didnt deserve my respect.


I think it's something everyone could work on
because i know we all deserve it 

I cant change the world obviously but I do wish people would see the importance in this. 

Im kinda a feminist and I think girls definatly deserve more respect from eachother. and from men. 

so you're reading this i assume you care or are at least curious 
if you decide one thing I hope that we can decide to take some baby steps here.
maybe by starting even with the difference in people respect their thoughts, ideals, belief, ect. No matter how different from yours.
or even just realizing that we're really not more important than anyone person. 

This is something I feel really strongly about right now. 
so is so much more I want to express I just can't find the words."

So sometimes you play the cards you got.
Even if it is a bitch move.

Let me tell you I have never felt so good. 

On the other hand I'm still really naive about him. 
this i know. and I keep hopeing he didnt do what he did.

very fair on my end of things. but i can understand the choices he's made.
they've been better ones for him and his family.
but im still hurt.

is it possible to love and not know you were until now?
i think it might be?
I miss our friendship immensly. 
he knows what he did wrong.
and even with everything going and even though we cant be together anymore. 
he still cares with whats happening with me and i appreciate his maturity. 
So I'm glad that he has kept his word.

Daniel really makes me mad. still.
what he did was unfair.
I was 15 years old! 15. 
he ruined my reputation.
and self esteem.
and he got away with everything.
and so did his friends.
No body deserves what he did. 
it was cruel and humanilating.
I wish he didnt get away with it.
He got a slap on the wrist and I got called and liar and slut. 
I got blamed for what he did to me.
People saying I brought it apon myself.
Yeah fuckin right.
It's been two years since last saturday.
July 29. I thought i'd forgotten about it. 


Im gonna take boxing lessons though so im excited for that and 
I get to be in cali with no family. Im stayin with my grandma.
and eric is driving up to see me.

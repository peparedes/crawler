You seem really irrational and full of defense mechanisms.  Feel free to contact me once you've calmed down and can form some semblance of compassion but I can not deal with you right now.  It hurt to completely remove you but I had to.  I love you but for the life of me I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU right now."

"event","Psoriasis strikes agayne.  I never identified the skin condition I have on my hands and feet that my dad so lovingly passed doen to me but the last masseuse did.  I just know it's a fucking pain.  So I've got sores on mah left foot (is so much stronger than my right foot, right, Stewie?) right at the arch.  Joy.  LUSH's Ultra Bland is the only thing helping.  I wish I knew where my ace bandage was.  Argh.

IHR almost got cancelled.  The Croc is under new management and is going to charge IHR aka Cassandra for usage of the place on the one Sunday a month.  Like I may have previously said I was surprised that she/we weren't charged before but whatever.  Prolly brings a lot of business to the cafe.  I know I get breakfast there when I am setting up and other vendors do too.  They are busy when we're there.  ANYHOO, so the new mgmt told Cassandra I guess on Friday that they didn't have enough staff to do it on Sunday and even tho she paid a big deposit they had to cancel.  Argh.  So she looked around I guess and now it is at BLVD Galery like a block away.  Next to Roq La Rue, Moira ;)

So that's good that the shoe is actually happening because I have like 5 people coming to get stuff or checking it out blah blah blah.  What I am not happy about, yeah, selfishly, is that there are no space assignments and so it's first come, first served?!?!  Oh yeah, waiting in line on 2nd Avenue, getting smelly and people no doubt smoking in line and on my sore foot, yay, with all my stuff.  Just want I wanna do after a nice shower.  Suckage.  Not happy.  And then my lungs ans sinuses will be shit and I have to work tomorrow and the next day la de da prolly the day after that.  I ws told 4 -5 days and it's already been 2 but the VP almost gave the impression that they could use me longer (after stating how impressed she was with me).  Anyhoo...

Also not happy because, well, because there's no assignments the jewelry peeps won't necessarily be spaced out well.  I HATE TALKING TO/BEING AROUND OTHER JEWELRY PEOPLE AT CRAFT SHOWS.  I will probably end up near annoying Mary who sells ming dynasty vase pendants on cord, oh yeah, THAT'S handmade.  I told Cassandra but I don't think she said anything because she thinks Mary is annoying too.  Why does her name have to be Mary?  I should call her by her full name.  There is a vendor called Erika as well but she doesn't do jewelry and she is grand :)

ALSO I wanted to bring my new sunshine lamp for light but I duno how that will go.  Actually, if it's a gallery I may not have to worry about lighting for once.  Ugh.

Thank fuck Jack In The Box serves burgers 24/7 because I want one and some seasoned curly fries.  Yay, go fat girl!

I guess I don't care about the things I have bitched about so much if I make some money.  

Nuffa dat.  I gotta get up and take a shower.  Argh."

I just had to type this out.  I cannot stop thinking about her.  I was going to send her care packages of jewelry supplies and basic jewelry books once her disability kicked in.  I dunno if she sent anyone else extra stuff with their BUTTS bracelets but she sent me a bracelet and a necklace.  Yeah, I posted about it and you guys probably read it.  Anyhoo, I think she had potential and what better thing to do on disability than crafts?

I am glad I got to tell her what she meant to me before she died.  That was the best thing about her suicide attempt.  I wonder if other people she knew feel the same.

"event","The reason why a lot of people did not like The Lady In The Water is that it was marketed as a horror movie and it is NOT A HORROR MOVIE.  It's more sci-fi or fantasy than anything.

(And next time <lj user=comraderadmila> comes to visit I will make sure to rent it because Bob Balaban's death scene is fucking hilarious.)

I dunno how I feel about M Night Shyamalan playing important roles in his own films.  I like the guy and I think he is a good actor and OF COURSE he is going to portray the characters in the way they're meant to be portrayed but...  it's just a little... I dunno.  Pre-fab?  I mean, you just see him and you know he's going to be an important man in the film.  His character in Signs was just... surreal.  I mea, when he's introduced in the film, ""there he is"", and Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix and the kids all look at him and I was thinking ""uh, yeah, he wrote, produced, and directed the movie, wtf?"" but what it meant was that he killed Gibson's character's wife by accident.  Ummm, talk about yer run on sentences.

I do adore his mind, though. Maybe I am just not used to this kind of participation in a movie.  Stephen King's participations are funny and Alfred Hitchcock is like Waldo.

oh yeah, and the beginning of TLitW is hilarious.

During the movie I was reminded of the uber depressing ending to Broken Flowers.  Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

Ummmm also saw the end of Sexy Beast finally.  What a fucking great movie.  I want John to watch it with me but he won't because he doesn't like to watch British movies because he thinks I'll start talking cockney and talk about England and he's always sick of it.  Shame.  It's the same reason he hasn't watched the masterpiece that is Lock Stock...

Ging.  Paddy and I had a dumb arguement about Ken Griffey Jr.  The announcer on tv said Griffey hadn't been in Seattle for 9 years.  I said that wasn't right because I know I saw my First Mariners game here in 99 and Griffey was the only one that scored.  Unneccessary anger ensued and when I was looking it up to prove the announcer was wrong he got all nubby and knew he was going to be wrong and admitted he was an ass when I said ""Mariners, 1989 - 1999.  Reds, 2000 - present.  That's NOT 9 years!""  Paddy said that he appreciates that not a lot of people would put up with his silliness.  Word that.

No, he wasn't going for that karate kid look of the 80s.  We were both tired from lack of sleep and long days and grief and BEING IN THE FUCKING DESERT.  That's my Uncle Jerry behind him aka the man who walked me down the aisle aka my dad's brother.  One day perhaps I will bore you with the story of his name (it's not really Jerry) came from a Russian nickname and everyone in synagogues say it's a made up name.  Weird, esp because he has a cousin (that goes by Larry) that has the exact same name.  anyhoo...

I started watching a horror movie on demand yesterday but I totally forgot what it was and what it was about.  uhhhhh, wow, I am sick.  I did see Broken Flowers and the ending made me sad :(  Reminded me a little bit of About Schmidt because it's men on journeys but the end of About Schmidt made me cry but it was a GOOD ending.  I also finally saw Shallow Grave which was fucked up.  

Haha funny thing while watching the Shield.  Commercials for The Riches came on and John said that Eddie Izzard sounded like he was from New England.  I laughed and said he was British, was a comedian, and liked to wear makeup and women's clothing.  Anyhoo, it's the same accent Eddie used in Mystery Men like when he said ""Baby Bowler"".  Hugh Laurie has the best American accent, IMHO.  Actually, I'm surprised how good Minnie Driver's is.

"event","I just heard this great song being piped in where a girl (or two?  Or maybe it was a vocal effect) was singing something like ""I believe when I fall in love with you it'll be forever"" over and over again with some guitars in there, kinda slow.

Anyone know this song?"

"event","I was coming home from Nordstrom Rack this afternoon but couldn't turn into my condo complex.  I had to go up Wolverine and turn around and then I noticed the left-turn lane was blocked off.  The traffic light was blinking and there were cops all over and a news van across the street.  The section that was taped off in front of my complex had a van in it but I couldn't tell what was going on.  I got into the left-turn lane behind the cones, pointed to my complex and mouthed ""I live there"" to the cop and he stopped traffic to wave me through.  It was weird.

<a href=""http://www.king5.com/localnews/stories/NW_091906WABbellevueaccidentJK.26e68e0d.html"">So now I know</a>.  Actually, John said he saw it on the news, our neighbour was a witness and was on TV and the anchorman was talking to the camera and you could see our building right behind him.

I can't say I'm surprised - there have been a few times when the light turns green (when I'm leaving the complex - which is the ONLY time THAT light turns green) and I'm almost hit by someone going southbound, running a red light.

Anyhoo, sheesh."

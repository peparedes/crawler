I can't believe that, as an educated woman, I would still have to look people in the face who would&nbsp;disregard <em>my</em> intelligence, <em>my</em> perspective, and <em>my </em>experiences because I don't play follow-the-leader and have faith in a man who smirks at us while his cronies weave deceit and thousands die in an unsupported war.&nbsp; (While at home, I still have to fight for my right not to reproduce, fight for my tax dollars to be spent on sensible sociological initiatives--not abstinence education for college-age students; I will not accept this when inner-city youth cannot even get degrees in order to go to college--still have to pay out-of-pocket for medical care that is inadequate and cost-prohibitive, still have to listen to people preach against issues like gay rights, have to wonder what private information is being collected unlawfully and without clear reason.)&nbsp; How many guys have I known who have entered the military as a last resort, because they were trying to get out of poverty, get away from abuse, break the cycle of addiction? Trying to make a better life for themselves? Trying to find a steady-paying job when they knew they couldn't enter the traditional workforce without better&nbsp;credentials, education, or skills?&nbsp; How many of those guys have I known who were obviously suffering from anger, PTSD, and depression? How many did I part with wondering if they were going to take a&nbsp;gun to their own heads because of what they had experienced?&nbsp; And how many of those guys will come home without appendages, or to beat their wives and kids, to become alcoholics (if they aren't already), to shoot themselves?<br /><br />It's serious when Americans don't have any compassion for other Americans, let alone citizens of other countries.&nbsp; It's appropriate to be angry, and not enough people are."

<P>It's really no wonder that so many cities in the US deem recycling not cost-effective.&nbsp; Compared to the trash that we take out every week, the accepted recycle-able material seems negligible.&nbsp; There are two problems that cause this:&nbsp; packaging made out of non-recycle-able materials and our own irresponsible consumerism (my own, personal irresponsible consumerism angers me).&nbsp; It's also bothersome that there isn't a sanitary way to dispose of biodegradeable food waste.&nbsp; It's nonsensical to toss it in with the other stuff that can't rapidly biodegrade.</P>

<P>And stop baking cookies.</P>
<P>Even with plans (plans? I had plans?) on hold, my bachelor's degrees, moving into a house, and planning for my financial future have all given me the feeling that some change has occurred.&nbsp; Both internally and externally.&nbsp; Of course, it may be just relief over having (<EM>finally</EM>) graduated.&nbsp; It's taken me 8 years.&nbsp; 8 years to get my bachelor's degrees.&nbsp; Strangely, I'm dying to pick them up from OSU but haven't as yet gotten any notification that they're ready.&nbsp; 4 years ago I wouldn't have considered them to be much of an accomplishment.&nbsp; I would have shrugged it off as fulfilling a status quo, as doing what I'm supposed to be doing in the long line of steps that society expects you to take in order to become a productive member in their midst.&nbsp; But for me, looking at how long it's taken and what I've been doing and how hard those first four years actually were, it is an accomplishment.&nbsp; A personal one.&nbsp; And I never thought I would be proud of a mere bachelor's degree (or even two), but <EM>I</EM>&nbsp; know how much it took to get them, and that's all that matters.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>I'm finally figuring out the nuances of livejournal.&nbsp; I've mostly been writing nothing of substance because I haven't wanted to risk being read by the wrong people. (Oh, yes, feel guilty:&nbsp; you know&nbsp;who&nbsp;you are.)&nbsp; And I can't seem to get my face from appearing at every entry, but I'll play with it some other time.</P>
<P>Inviting people to the party I want to have is becoming a chore rather than something fun.&nbsp; I'm not sure why.&nbsp; It's something I dread.&nbsp; Not so much inviting them, but finding out which people won't come.&nbsp; I know that being in Dayton is inconvenient when most of my friends live in Cols.&nbsp; But this place is much more comfortable than any place I would have in Cols.--much better for entertaining.</P>
<P>Of course, everything seems like a chore.&nbsp; I'm aimless, and that's always bad for my psychology.&nbsp; I sit with my ass on the couch and flip from web page to web page, as if there will be something new there, something that I missed the first three times I checked the site that will distract me from myself for a few more seconds.</P>
<P>I'm already missing an educated environment, where the people in my vicinity understand and accept nuances in human behavior/current events.&nbsp; I always say that I don't look down on people who don't have an education.&nbsp; <EM>This</EM>, at least, is true.&nbsp; But I do look down upon people who don't care to educate <EM>themselves</EM>, who just use osmosis to gain any knowledge about the world.&nbsp; I really don't understand where that sense of self-pride went to the wayside.&nbsp; My grandparents are self-educated, and at 80 and 85 they're still learning new things about the world and can speak competently about subjects that are pertinent.&nbsp; Then there's this provincial laziness that I can see in my parents' and my generation that is such a disgusting pity--the dissemination of knowledge is more fluid than it's ever been and yet people fill their brains with the trash at their fingertips.&nbsp; Where's the active learning?&nbsp; Books should not be anathema, nor should basic concepts of psychology or sociology.&nbsp; I just can't follow why there hasn't been a select number of intellectual mores integrated into our culture when we're supposed to be a nation of progress.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Instead, it's perfectly acceptable to take the words of celebrities as authoritative and to believe the news media of your choice.&nbsp; It's also acceptable to go through university having learned nothing but that you can pay your way through a system that will give you a piece of paper stating that you went through the probationary period successfully so that you can enter the work force at a higher pay scale.&nbsp; It's also perfectly acceptable to do stupid things in order to appear more socially elite.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I""m tired.&nbsp; I want to go to sleep an wake up in a cool garden without mosquitos.&nbsp; And faerie attendants will rub the kinks out of my neck and brush my hair (which will be long and flowing and of course--blonde).&nbsp; And I want their speech to be beautiful but unintelligible and for the air to be full of nothing else but nightnoises and the scent of magnolia blossoms.&nbsp; </P>"

This week has seen corn beef, talapia and soybeans, and now there's an Indian soup simmering on the stove ready to accompany the curry and jasmine rice.  It smells great and looks great.  I'm going throw together the ingredients to a cake, and then should be fairly well prepared to have a little dinner party with Jake, Thom, an Kait.  

Anyplace can feel like home when there's something good cooking on the stove.  Also can't wait to break out the borsche recipe. (Maybe next week--when the table and chairs aren't covered in stuff from the move?--definitely not a moveable feast.)"

Hope and coins and spearmint gum

Your cat's name and how many stripes she has
I know how you eat apples and how your writing looks

"event","I've been back the better part of 5 days and most of my time has been spent sleeping and moping.  I'm having a more difficult time than expected readjusting to the environment--the food, the attitudes, even the air.  People *amble* in Ohio.  I never saw anyone ambling in Moscow or Tomsk--everyone always had a purpose, they were keen on getting where they needed to go.  The diesal fumes from the roadway that goes past my apartment is a far cry from the pine smell of Tomsk.  And I've been in so many different beds in the past week (from the guest room in Masha's family's apartment, to the hotel in Moscow, to my own, to the one at my mom's place) that I wake up disoriented every time, wondering where I am (is this what it feels like to be a hooker?).  

I got out of my apartment because I was wallowing in my own disgruntledness at being back; it was too much effort to unpack, to fix a meal, to make a cup of tea.  I wasn't trying to adjust my sleep schedule, I wasn't trying to reflect on the better parts of my trip, I was watching Maury Povich and sitting on MSN.  Now I'm here, and at least I have to interract with people, and I'll see my grandparents Sunday, but that part of me that always feels anxious to just get out is already trying to plan the next affordable trip to whereever I can manage to go.  

I'm forcing myself through each moment, telling myself that I don't have to like it, that I just have to do it.  And if I can concentrate on just doing it rather than liking it (it's such a contrast from the constant sensory stimulation of being in a place that is completely unfamiliar to what I've been used to for most of my life), then I can get through it.  I'll get used to everything again, the magic of Russia will take a backseat to daily life, and all of this won't feel so uncomfortable and alien.  But I'll still have to go back and go through the process all over again.  Since the first trip to Russia 13 years ago, the question has never been *will I go back?*, but *when will I go?*  To many Americans (at least most of those who I have talked to), Russia still seems a rare and exotic destination, no touristy vacation spot--its history has not yet faded into a time without context, and its national emblems still have an authoritarian aura that does, in fact, feel threatening and powerful . . . unlike the Tower of London, Arc d'Triumph (sorry--I'm clueless when it comes to French), even the Statue of Liberty, which have all been relegated to mere cultural conversation pieces that are as awe-inspiring as the coffeetable paperweight."

Unfortunately, the Kremlin was closed yesterday, so I didn't get to see the Armory.  We did see Lenin, which was terribly underwhelming.  At least the wait was only . . . 2 hours.  He looked like wax, except for the hands, which seemed the most real part of him.  It wasn't even creepy it was so not-special; it was hard to believe that it was real and not a dummy.  And there's some speculation that that's exactly what it is.

Afterwards, it was a stroll through the souvenir bazaar again, more for fun this time than for serious shopping.  I did find a pair of silver earrings that an old woman was selling--the price she gave me for them was way too cheap, and I almost felt guilty buying them for the 200 rubles she offered.  They're beautiful and very Russian looking.

Feeling drained.  Glad to have had these days in Moscow.  Didn't get to meet with Tanya, but we talked on the phone.  This morning I saw the sun rising over the city--it was red and casting a glow over the river--and it was a really nice moment that I felt was sort of just for me."

She had to buy things for the Slavic outreach program at OSU, and helped her carry stuff and found some little souvenirs of my own. So it looks like I'll have some small things to bring back after all.  In Tomsk, I kept my eye out for the really nice things, but I realize I forgot all the cute, happy souvenirs that Russia has to offer.  We were so tired from sleeping little and the 4 hour time difference that everything was making us laugh, from the faces on the Gzhel animals to the guy who talked us into buying a couple of his fur hats.  The souvenirs were not as cheap as they were 10 years ago (no surprise), but there were some really nice affordable things that will be easy enough to pack.  

Like everywhere in Russia, it's the old women and the handicapped people who are manning the booths.  It was almost difficult NOT to buy from some of them because the hours of work that went into some of the handmade items is apparent.  Miriam bought out one old lady selling handknitted baby booties--she had purchased from this same woman last year.  Everyone is so nice, too--really willing to help you to find the exact item that you want, really happy that you're interested in what they have to sell.  The old ladies are the best--they wrap things so carefully and make sure that you have a bag big enough to hold everything.  Miriam bought some painted eggs from one guy who was packing up, and he was so careful to wipe the fingerprints off of each egg and find the matching stand for them before wrapping them.  

Today, our plan is to see Lenin (a morbid desire, but I just feel that it's a necessary site before he either decays or someone decides to bury him), and then I've talked some people into seeing the armory museum with me (yay!).  I've seen it twice, although so long ago now I'm sure I'll have a better appreciation of what I'm seeing.  (Like everything so far on this trip.)  Then more souvenir shopping. There really are some things that I would be stupid to leave without.  Carved wooden characters, boxes, the odd little creatures made of glass or ceramic, etc.  The colors and the designs are so beautiful, and they look especially beautiful all together--it's an overload of visual stimulation.  

I'm glad to have these two days in Moscow.  This buffer between the regretful air of leaving Tomsk and draining flight back to Ohio is welcome.  Moscow is a serious place, if you want it to be.  But if you just want to be a tourist, if you want to gawk and get lost and speak half English/half Russian, no one has a problem with it."

Given enough time and money, it would be impossible to get bored here--even seeing the same monuments, churches, and parks every day.  The view from our hotel looks over Izmailovsky, nearby which there is a souvenir bazaar and through which runs a river. 

Leaving Tomsk, to be honest, was somewhat of a relief.  I almost dreaded this pitstop in Moscow, but now that I'm here I almost don't want to leave.  Almost?  Okay, maybe not--completely.  But going makes coming back sweeter.

Trying to get a hold of Tania, but her phone goes unanswered.  She emailed me, so that means she's around...

Going to get lunch then to souvenirs.  I feel like my luggage can't be big enough.  This time in Russia, I know what I want and what is inherently worthless and ""touristy.""   The stuff that I really want is, as I stated before, too expensive and too heavy, but beautiful. 

Last night the family took me to Slavinsky Bazaar, which used to be a trading post when Tomsk was the Siberian center for trade.  Now it's a restaurant--the nicest in Tomsk. We really went there on a whim (I would hav been fine staying home), but I'm glad I got to experience it.  My fellow travellers are envious that I got to check it out.  It's beautiful inside, there was liv music (I'm not dropping e's by accident, this computer is automatically changing certain combinations of words into cyrillic), and the deserts--so impossibly good and drizzled with chocolate and garnished with fresh forest berries and flowers.  

Time for lunch and shopping.  Moscow is 4 hours behind Tomsk, so this is going to be a long day, especially since the last two nights I've only gotten 3 and 4 hours of sleep respectively.  It's a hard thing to think that I never know when I'm coming back to Russia--that it's such a far place, and more difficult for Americans to go to than some of the Western countries."

Everyone passed out gifts and flowers, and all of the students got nice little graduation certificates in Russian.  The teachers sang traditional Russian songs for us, and it was all very, very nice.  I'm crying over the keyboard, even though it may be a little silly.  Tatiana Borisovna got us all Tomsk State University shirts, which is great because I wanted to buy one anyway.  Tamara's statement made me cry too--really because it was all true when she said that if any of us wanted to come back we would be welcome.  

I think everyone's tired and actually glad to be leaving.  I'm just tired in general.  Tired of being tired.  Tired of feeling a little lost and like I don't really fit in anywhere.  I love being able to adjust to different environments and to travel, but I haven't yet found any place that really *feels* like home.

I bought tons of Russian chocolate.  So much I'm not sure I'll be able to get it home.  But I decided to do that instead of gifts because I'm running low on room and I'm afraid they're going to charge the weight of my suitcase as it is.  I bought a couple of things for myself, but as far as souvenirs go--you've all see the typical stuff anyway and the a-typical stuff is too expensive or too fragile.  I wanted to buy a samovar while I was here--hah.  Like I'd be able to take that as carry-on.  

We were supposed to fill out evaluation forms for the trip.  They really push you in the direction of saying only positive/neutral things and don't give very much room for ideas for improvement.  The things that I tried to write about the trip seemed so out of place there--either like I was playing into their trap of writing how great it was or being a total humbug by writing the things that need improvement.  The mechanics of the trip really only had a couple of flaws--the fact that I didn't have a book in the beginning and that the group was simply too big to be under the direction of one group leader.  (I would have also liked to have had more language instruction, but not with the noise of the renovations going on at the university nor in this heat.)  

The most problems I had were those with the group, and how can you really fix that sort of mentality?  The focus on drinking until you embarrass yourself was just so . . . innapropriate.  And what can you do about that?  Tell people they can't drink?  That would be insulting to those of us who are responsible.  I feel like I'm just complaining if I write that on an evaluation because I can't see any solution to it.  It is, after all, part of this culture--but Russia *does* have one of the highest rates of alcoholism.  A couple of the guys here haven't been sober one night since the 2nd week.  The problem is with them, not the program, but I think it still reflects poorly on us as a whole.  

Tomorrow we have a party for the teachers at a place called ""Zhili Billi"" --that translates to ""Once Upon a Time.""  They serve traditional Russian dishes there, or so I've heard.  It's going to be sad.  All the instructors have been so good to us.  Even the ones that cut us no slack.  Maybe especially them.

"event","Recently I have been too lazy to post. I have time, but not the energy.  I want to deny the idea that I'm leaving in a week and yet I wake up every morning counting down the days with . . . dread, anxiety, uncertainty, and something else.

I left off after Evin and David came over for dinner.  The next evening, Eleanora took me around Tomsk to take some late-night pictures and look at some more of the wooden architecture.  Some of the buildings are in complete disrepair, and some are completely renovated.  In the Tartar district of Tomsk, my guidebook said that it was not uncommon to see camels walking the streets when Tomsk was a major trading center.  I could barely believe it when . . . 

I saw a camel.  I was speechless.  It wouldn't have even been such a strange sight had my guidebook specifically not mentioned camels.  But as it had, I thought I had to be seeing things because it just seemed too convenient to have a camel walking the streets.  

We also explored some church yards...one of which was closed for renovation, but we found a gap under the fence big enough for us to crawl under.  I admit that I'm sometimes braver here than I would be in the States because of two reasons:  one is that generally rules are lax (no matter how hard they try to inforce them, people really don't want to make the effort unless they're really bored or need some cash), and two is that I can always feign ignorance or misunderstanding.  Hahaha--or get angry.  Actually, we were told if a member of the militzia tries to stop us on the street to just keep walking and pretend not to hear.

The excursion yesterday was great.  We drove over the bridge across the river and were suddenly in a beautiful pine forest.  There were new houses (made to look old) being built at the edge of an old (old old old--like 3rd Century BCE) settlement. We were shown where the earthen walls had been to protect an enclosure from invaders and the dips in the land that marked where houses used to be. Apparently, these people dug into the ground and then put the roof over the hole so earth formed the walls.  The area we were looking at was a place where Kyrgize and Indo-European people met due to droughts and floods that drove them to the same spot.  Of course, the land was so changed--there was a beautiful veiw of a lake and there were kilometers of trees and trees and trees, but of course the trees grew up later and the lake was in an area that used to be a sea in the time of the Neanderthals (who also left evidence of being there).  

The guy who was our guide was also the guy who talked to us at the museum about the beginnings of Tomsk. He and the other archeologists working on the project were talking about the necessity to keep their findings quiet because of black market sales of artifacts.  Which is smart on one hand, but on the other hand, it's allowing the rich Tomichi (Tomsk-ovites) to build on the site despite the archeological importance of it.  There are loose regulations, but they aren't enforced.  What I can't understand is why they choose *that* particular spot, when there is more untouched, beautiful land than is even conceivable in Sibera.  

One thing that I was thinking about when I was walking (trying to stay either ahead of or behind the group, so that I could enjoy the silence and the air and the trees) was the absolute lack of reverence for nature--in general, and within our group.  David agreed when I said how strange it was that some people felt it was necessary to let their voices carry, when the weight of peacefulness drove everyone else into hushed tones.  It's not a unique feeling to understand yourself the intruder on such a place, especially when human beings lived there in accordance to the rules instead of in opposition with them, especially when we--clumsy, loud, physically unfit, and ignorant about the plant and animal life there--just come to look and leave.  

It's one of those things that I really respect the ""Russian soul"" for--the closeness and respect for nature, even though they have all this land.  Americans like their conveniences and luxuries too much to have a proper sense and reverence--it's all about money, it's all about YOU.  You find a tract of land, you build.  You have some land, you sell it.  No matter what will happen to it next.  Clear the trees, drive the wildlife out, and put in roads, electricity, noise, people, and trash.  It's all really trash anyway.  The houses being built aren't meant to withstand the years.  It's all a fucking waste.

Tomsk is 400 years old and is even smaller than Dayton.  400 years old, and when they had the option to have the Trans-siberian go through their town, they rejected it in order to keep the integrity of the place intact.  (That's why Novosibirsk is so large and ugly and industrial--it got the Trans-siberian instead).  While there are a lot of buildings going up now, many of them are built in a style that doesn't interrupt the charming facade of the town.  These buildings--they are built to last.  They're made of brick, which is hand-laid.  The walls are hand-plastered, the paint applied with brushes.  The old wrecks of houses that haven't been renovated are still in use; they aren't torn down, and only the ones in the worst shape are abandoned, but there is a general sense of wanting to keep things the way they always were.  

I haven't noticed any urban sprawl.  You can be in the center of the city, then all of a sudden in the country.  Grigorii drove Eleanora and I through some unpaved ""back"" roads, but within 30 seconds we were on Prospect Lenina once again.  Because the old buildings are so sturdy, they are used currently for offices or shops.  And anything new that goes up doesn't replace anything old, it's tucked in somewhere else. Those that seem out of place are looked at with a general sort of disdain for the tackiness and ""modernity"" they represent.  

I guess the American sense of ""taking over"" goes all the way back to its beginnings.  Everyone just swept West and swallowed up all of that land as they went--all within 300 years (give or take--I don't know that history well enough), to put in into perspective.  Even in Ohio, where there is still a lot of land, it's more common to see signs that advertise its sale than not.  In order to take a ""nature walk"" we have to stick to the pre-prepared trails in the preserves.  It makes me tired to think about.  Who the fuck really cares, anyway?  I must be a tree-hugger or something to even give a damn.  

I always wanted to have a little cottage (like a dacha) that I could go to in order to just to be alone. To smell fresh air and avoid the noises of other people, to not have a TV flickering in one room and a computer humming in the next.  Somewhere with a lot of windows and natural light (but kept cool by trees), where no one could bother me.  But it would have to be a lot of land so that if someone bought the next lot over they would be far enough away so that I wouldn't see or hear them.  I've wanted this since I was little.  But I may have to settle for an apartment in Moscow.  Nevermind, I'm hungover.

Last night, went out dancing with David.  Not as fun as Absent, but still a good time.  It was 1:30 am before we knew it.  It was too much like an American club for my liking--a lot of staff, a bad DJ, some scantily-clad stage dancers who would have looked better dressed as eskimos.  

Now that I've waxed poetic about nature, gotten nostalgic for a place I don't live in, and done a lot of complaining on the side, I'm going to go start my day."

"event","Yesterday after class was really a great time.  I called Evin and David, who were already hanging out together, and we met at Underground for vodka and ice cream.  I took my courage to the music shop where I asked to be shown some ""really great"" Russian music that I could take with me back to the States.  After my purchases, we stumbled past the tent of a political party and got free t-shirts.  

Once back at the apartment, we hung out and chatted, until Eleanora, Masha, and Grigorii returned.  Eleanora was so excited to have guests--she got out the borsch, fixed a salad, and suddenly we were all sitting around the table speaking (broken) Russian and eating until we could barely move.  I cleaned up and didn't get in bed until about midnight.  Class was difficult today, but that's okay.  It was well worth it and everyone really enjoyed themselves."

"event","I've decided that there's no sense in me leaving.  I can refund my plane ticket to Moscow, but not to the States, but I don't care.  Tamara says she may be able to find me a job at the university before the new term begins.  There are plenty of inexpensive one-room apartments for rent, and I may even be able to get one in one of the older buildings.  I'm tired of the States.  I want to travel this area by train and see more of the countryside, visit little villages, maybe save one of those little stray dogs.  And of course, learn the language.  That's what I came here to do, after all.

Masha thinks it's a great plan.  I thought: ""Why the hell not?  I'm already here.""  

Haha.  You thought I was serious.  Just checking to see who's listening."

Wow, it's so good to be back in Tomsk.  Masha and I had a great day yesterday, shopping and just generally being girls.  I'm slowly Russifying myself, at least outwardly.  I was tired of looking plain, so I got a pink satin skirt and pink shoes that lace up my ankles.  Now I can blend in with the Russki devushki.  I took the skirt and shoes dancing last night with Eleanora and Anna. There's no better way to break in a pair of shoes.  It was a great time!  I was worried at first because of the general aggressiveness of Russian men, but I didn't have any problems, probably because it was a club for ""older"" people (older than students--I'll soon fit into that category anyway . . .), and I was very protected in our little group.  Eleanora even accompanied me to the ladies'.  I don't know what she thought would happen to me, but it's just an example of how safe I really feel here.  Of course, I also still feel like a little girl, and I think they sort of look at me that way.  But it's nice.  

Masha and I have been talking about the differences between fashion in Russia and fashion in the States. It's so hard for me to explain to her.  There's so much diversity here, and women really look like women (they look like women because they are slim and leggy, but they also play it up with ultra-feminine clothing).  In Ohio, there's sort of a boring uniform that we all have to adhere to, or we're looked at like we're not normal.  Women don't wear skirts or dresses for daytime, heels are relagated to evening wear, and don't even think about going without a bra (okay, so I still think that's indecent).  Masha was worried that she would look out of place in the States . . . and she's right.  I told her the worse that would happen would be that people would look at her.  She just shrugged, ""And what?""  And she's right.  Who cares if people look?  Every female in Ohio owns the same stupid shirt from Express or Gap--and god knows we don't walk anywhere, so what's the big deal if we go around in heels instead of sneakers?  Of course, if I lived in a climate that I had to wear furs and boots and hats and scarfs 7 months out of the year, I'd probably go in the skimpiest clothing I could during the summer too.  And it's true that the lack of fashion sense still lingers in the women who remember more vividly the years before the previous decade, but Russian women really dress with a sense of knowing who they are and what looks great on them.  Baggy jeans are unheard of.  Of course, it helps that they're all hot.  Maybe Ohio fashion follows necessity . . . 

I was too busy complaining in the last post to really tell of the good parts of Krasnoyarsk.  The trip into the mountains was really special.  People were taking photos, but there's no way a photo could capture the view in such a way that would make anyone understand how it felt to be there, looking over those miles and miles of untouched Siberian landscape.  And if I even try to describe it, I'll wax hokey poetic, and that won't do it justice.  It might suffice to say that it's no wonder Russia breeds poets and artists, and that there is a collective sense about life's lyricism.  

It was really great, too, when Masha met me at the train station.  I love this girl so much.  I'm going to miss her like crazy and already thinking about ways I can steal her away.  I feel somehow she's suffocating in Tomsk. She's always listless, always needing some mental stimulation, and seems perpetually unsatisfied.  She's mentioned coming to the States, but I don't know if she'll find what she's looking for there.  It might just be too generally Puritanical for her, even without the overwhelming sense of nationalism she experiences here in Russia (there' still some sense of shame in people who aren't ""purely"" Russian--for example, Tartars and Jews and Gypsies).  

In Novosibirsk, I was so tense from being around my group, I couldn't relax.  I vented to her and immediately felt better, and these last two days have been so relaxing.  I'm back to feeling happy and satisfied again.  Masha is very sensitive to my moods, and I almost wish that she wasn't because I have a very hard time hiding them.  But it's okay because I can tell her honestly what I'm feeling and even if she doesn't understand, she accepts it.  She doesn't tell me I should feel a different way, and just because she listens I immediately feel better.  I think maybe she doesn't understand exactly why I feel so venomous after spending time with the Americans, and frankly I'm having a difficult time expressing it--maybe no one really understands, least of all them.  

Tonight we may go to a different club, one that Masha will be permitted to go to.  I love dancing so much, and I always feel so healthy the next morning.  And in Russia there seems to be a complete lack of insecurity about getting out on the dance floor and doing whatever it is that you want to do.  No one is trying to show off or impress anyone--people are dancing for themselves.  And thank god there wasn't any hip hop playing.  I can't dance to that even after drinking.  

Masha keeps saying that people are more polite to me because they know I'm American.  I wish I could fully understand this or have a basis for comparison.  I don't get the reverence for Americans.  Masha surmised (yes, in fact, she *surmised*) that it is because America is one of the wealthiest and most powerful countries.  But I don't have anything to do with that personally.  It's just the luck of the draw that I was born in the States.

There's a fierce national pride in the outcome of WWII for Russians; even Masha feels it.  Of course, that was something that the Americans were making fun of, too, saying that Russia didn't have anything else to be proud of so they had to keep bringing up the war.  I can't speak with any expertise on the war, and I'm not sure that you can win with a choice between Stalin and Hitler, but my personal view is that there's still a keen awareness of the loss of life--and instead of actively mourning the Stalinist purges, there's an active honoring of those who fought to keep the country Russian.  Maybe it has to do with social psychology, but it's probably more healthy to honor the veterans than to rehash the other horrors of the last century."

"event","Back in Tomsk again.  Hurray!  The negative attitude of the Amerikanskiis were really getting me down.  There isn't a thing that escaped their sarcastic commentary.  It really made everything unpleasant.  

For example, the day before yesterday, we took a trip into the mountains to see some view of the huge river that runs through Krasnoyarsk (which means ""red slope,"" btw)--someday I'll look up the name of this river.  The view was such that you never wanted to leave it, and the air was clean and fresh.  People had tied different ribbons to the trees to make wishes with. I asked Colin to take a picture for me because I thought it was lovely.  He said, ""It looks like trash.""

Then we went to the hydroelectric dam.  It wasn't the most interesting excursion, but I've never seen a dam before and we were only their 5 minutes.  Everyone complained the whole time.  ""Why are we here?  It's just a dam.""

Basically, I felt embarrassed to be seen with many of them.  Malinkaya threw up in the hotel hallway after a bought of drinking, a girl who's name i won't mention threw a fit because coffee wasn't served at the free breakfast, and people just generally bitched about everything from Russian service to the price of beer, to the fact that the toilets on the train were locked when we were at a station.  it got to the point where we were no longer a travelling group of students researching the way of life in another country--we were just the asshole Americans that foreigners have come to despise.  

Here, things are different.  For better or for worse, they're different.  I'm not going to compare to in the States--it's futile.  And however the complaint originates, it's much better than it was 10 years ago.  

Sarah and I were talking about how people in the States see education as a means to a career.  At least one girl in our cabin almost had an aneurism trying to digest the idea that that isn't, in fact, why some people go to university.  Some people, like myself and others who concentrate their studies in the humanities, go to better themselves, to get the education that can't be gotten simply by sitting around and reading books.  I'm not fooling myself by believing that my university education is going to get me any better job.  But I don't regret it and I don't want to stop.  

I should write more, but Masha and I need to do more shopping.  We purchased about 2 pounds of creams and scrubs at a shop that specializes in such things.  They're all very good and very inexpensive--about 20 rubles being the average.  It's been a great day so far--so relaxing and so much fun.

BTW, I didn't get to ride the train home by myself.  Eleanora and Masha showed up with Eleanora's friend Anna, who drove to Novosibirsk for business and shopping.  So I went back by car.  It was wonderful to see Masha again and know that I would get to spend a few days with her without the interference of university or other responsibilities.

More later..."

"event","So I'm here.  I'm not sure whether I regret coming or not. There's nothing special to Krasnoyarsk.  The one museum we've seen hasn't been that great.  I've spent most of my time on Ul. Mira, peeking into shops and getting these strange smiles from people who hear my accent.  I don't know if it's good natured or they think I'm an idiot, but I usually extricate myself from situations that could be potentially embarrassing because of my language skills (lack thereof).

I skipped out on the nature preserve hike today.  I spent a whole day in the city by myself and loved every moment of it.  At first I took the wrong bus, thinking that the ""Across the bridge"" stop was the other way, when actually it was right in front of our hotel, so I rode all the way to the bus station (ha ha), through a rather industrial part of Krasnoyarsk, waiting to go across the bridge.  The woman who takes the money was very nice in helping me to get the same bus the other way.  I can't imagine being a foreigner in America.  The situation would probably be much different.  Imagine a person who speaks very little English asking for directions in a Chinese accent with a decidedly Asian face.  Of course, you or me might help them, but I think for the most part people would pretend not to understand.  

I especially wanted to go to an antique shop, but it's closed on Monday.  I hope to be able to check it out tomorrow.  However, I had a nice little chocolate coffee (decidedly not a moca--more like melted chocolate with a shot of coffee; something you'd more likely pour over icecream.  ie, really really good), walked and ""shopped"" and just felt good about being alone and being on my own clock.  

Thom, if you read this, I found some acrylics but they're the basic colors.  I think I really didn't do you any favors by buying them, but it was about $30 for five.  I hope that's a good price, and if it isn't, I'm sorry.  It was at a seemingly real art store that I found them, and that's the only place I've seen any acrylics.  So.  

Last night David and I spent the evening in the city, walking from one side of World Street to the other.  We had a great chat over coffee (chocolate), and just basically enjoyed being so cosmopolitan."

"event","Looks as though I'm going to Krasnoyarsk, then taking the train back from Novosibirsk early.  I'll still get to see both cities, and, if Masha's up to it, she's going to meet me in Novosibirsk and ride back with me to Tomsk. This would be good for her since she's going crazy from boredom this summer. I think she's disappointed that I decided to go, but we're in agreement that it's good I'll be coming back early.  I'm starting to look forward to it.  Some of the other students now know that Miriam has been alerted to the problem, so maybe they'll be more willing to say something to the troublemakers.  

Evin called me yesterday to tell me that she hoped I was going.  Small gestures like that mean the world to me.  Making new friends doesn't make going back to Cols. look so bleak, though I won't have amazing meals materialize in front of me and I'll have to worry once again about

bills bills bills bills
bills bills bills

Anyway, it's still three weeks away.  I'm already trying to hatch my next plans for travel.  

Tomsk is growing on me, though.  I'm starting to be familiar with the town, starting to understand the layout.  The public transportation is reliable, though old and crowded, there really isn't a lack of products in the stores like there was 10 years ago in Obninsk, and there are really some little treasures tucked in the pockets of the city.  

I called David, fellow runaway that he is, and we were talking about how it's easy to appreciate the charm of someplace if you know you can leave any time you want.  It's true.  I breathe easier everytime I know that I can escape Columbus (or whereever) whenever I want.  It's being trapped because of money, because of some life-sucking minimum wage position, or because I don't have anywhere to go that drives me to the edge.  Once I've seen a place and gotten familiar with it, it's time to move on.  Once I've been there, I know I can always go back, but there are so many places to see that I can't understand spending too much time in one place.  It's also part of my reasoning for going on half of the trip:  I'll have been to those cities, have ridden the train as an adult (on my trip to Moscow in '94, our hands were held the whole way), I'll be familiar with the process.  Already dreaming of taking the railroad from the west of Russia to the East."

"event","Why is all the food here the best food I've ever eaten? It appears as if by magic.  I don't know when Eleanora cooks, but there's always something on the stove.  Today it was the chunkiest spaghetti sauce ever.  It's no wonder Russian kids never leave home.  

I think Miriam talked me into going at least to Krasnoyarsk, then taking the 5 hour train ride back by myself once we reach Novosibirsk.  It seems like a brilliant plan, and the coolest part of it is riding the train by myself.  

I told her the main reason I didn't want to go next to language--and that was the attitude of people and *some people* in particular.  I've never been one to be able to brush aside someone who is being obnoxious just for the sake of daring someone to tell them to shut up.  I'll accept the dare, and that's when everyone thinks that I'm the lesser person because I couldn't just ignore it and move on.  

I had to laugh at Malinkaya today.  We were talking about politics (in Russian) and he was talking about how Ronald Reagan was an American hero for ending the Cold War.  Anna Nikolaevna backed me up when I was trying to counter with all of the real reasons the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union broke up--like perestroika and glasnost, like the rise of the oligarchs, the demand for independence from the smaller countries of the federation, etc. etc. etc.  He's the kind of person I am embarrassed to be seen with and called ""American""--and sadly, he's representative of a large portion of the United States.  How can someone like him travel and still cling to what he thinks are good ol' American values?  WHY does he travel?  Why doesn't he just go back to his hamburgers and mommy and daddy and the Catholic church and listening to Fox news and jerking off every night to fantasies about the war in Iraq?  I certainly don't give two shits if you have that view, but the people who seem to have that view seem to be the ones who have chips on their shoulder a mile wide and just can't keep their politics/religion/or sick connections to their mommies to themselves.

Anyway, I've got to go grocery shopping (and calm down) if i'm to go tonight.  Pack, too. I won't be able to post while I'm away so I'll either do another tonight or tell all about my adventures when I return.

"event","I am definitely gaining weight. The slivki, the slivki!  Cream is in everything, sour cream is on everything, and there's no such thing as ""low fat"" here.

After some crafty finegalling on Masha's part, it is almost conclusive that I will stay here for the week that the rest of the Amerikanki will be doing some travelling.  She was going to come with us, but because the hotel rooms were booked too far in advance, there's no place for her to stay.  Would I like to go?  Yes and no.  Yes, because I'd like to see Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk.  I'd like to ride the train again, see the countryside pass by.  

But it seems the negatives outweigh the positives.  NUMBER ONE is that it will be a whole week in Russia where I will not be speaking Russian, no matter what rules Miriam tries to enforce.  Number two, which is also very high on the list is that when the Americans get together, there is so much bad energy that it inevitably makes moral sink lower and lower.  Number three is that I'm just tired of some of them as individuals, tired of their irreverent behavior, tired of their ingratitude, tired of their overtly snide ""patriotic"" remarks.  Then there's the fact that I'll get to hang out with Masha and Eleanora and just *be* in Russia.  

I will be happy not to have to follow the group leader around in our herd of scowling faces, happy to have clean clothes daily, happy to eat or read or take a walk on no one's time but my own.  

I'm reading The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe po-russki now.  With the help of the same book in English!"

What?  No one responded to my post about the KGB?

The article was in the newspaper today. There's a very good picture of Thad, Colin, Sarah, and Doug.  I wasn't quoted by name, but I think there's something in there that are my words.  I had to leave early, and I didn't speak in Russian, so that may be why.

Everyone in my group went to the dacha today.  I came home, and I'm glad.  Every day I lose more and more interest in spending time with the Americans in general.  I'm not looking forward to our trip to Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk.  I don't want to go, don't want to be away from the language (because no one cares to speak Russian when we're together), and don't really want to take a week away from my family here."

"event","Wowie. It has been a while since i have written in here. Whatever though i dont really care. Man I have been so depressed.  Even as i write this im starting to cry. I dont get it. I get like this somtimes like out of the blue i get really emo.  The thing is I have at least a semi-legitamate reason.  I dont know if i want to share it with the whole world though.  Anywho its just been really rough lately.  I just want things to go back to where they were earlier this year when everything was good. When i felt loved.  I dont know i shouldnt feel like this i know because its so pointless. I mean to most people i have a good life.  A good family, a boyfreind that i care about, good freinds. But i always have this feeling of insignificance like if i didnt wake up tomorrow no one would care or notice.  I dont really add much to anyones life. In fact i prob. make it worse since i am a stupid bitch most of the time.  Yeah well i dont know i guess ill just be a fag and sit all alone in my room

"event","Hey,
It been quite a while since i have updated.  Lets see here I have been pretty busy lately doing odds and ends.  You know how it is.  Ummm ITS CHRISTMAS BREAK!! I have a christmas party tonight then saturday i have the spanish feild trip then i come back sleep and go to babysit.  Sunday i am having a small gathering then lets see um Monday i am going to be eating a family breakfast and celebrating my BIRTHDAY! wee hoo.  17 baby! So i will be attending the Christmas Carol.  Then on tuesday i will be sleeping because i am pretty sure im going to be exsausted.  Yeah thats it.  Lets see... more news, me and tony are still going out.  Hes a great guy.  I feel bad though because i feel like I am ditching u guys.  I always hated those people who got boyfreinds and then never made time for their freinds.  If i have been that way i apologize. Even though it may not seem it at time i really am trying to balance boyfreind and freind.  Yeah well i was thinking last night about everyone leaving for college and it is so sad. Honestly i dont know what i am going to do.  I know i will have you guys and i am happy for that but a lot of my freinds will be leaving.  I guess i am going to live it up while i can.  Enjoy myself and not worry about them leaving.  
Well enough of my rambling.  I will see you soon im sure. 
Sarah"

"event","hey y'all! whats new in the world of all of you? as you can tell...well maybe you can...im back from my vacation, one week of heaven. yes it was a grand old time and i needed it by george. but i did miss all of my friends.  so yeah anyways. well what i've noticed when i've come back is that this whole ""group"" thing we have going here is very disfunctional.  now now, i know im not the first and definately not the last to recognize this, but im gonna put my two sense in anyways.  first off:  there is ALWAYS gonna be someone having a bad day....our group is so big, and there are so many different lives going on that and it will be a rare occassion when every single person is happy and rarin' to go at a ""get together."" you know? so instead of people getting deppressed because other people are deppressed, or people getting mad at the person for having a bad day, they should just stop worrying because at the end of the night that person will be FINE and if they wanna be left alone then LEAVE THEM ALONE, and if they need some comforting words then go talk to them for a few minutes. but geeze guys! dont let one little thing effect ur whole night, or week, or month, or even ur year! (friends theme) haha. everyone has bad days. everyone is guilty of that.  and everyone knows that those bad days go away.  so why is everyone so strung out about it! i mean really...there are a couple individuals at this very moment that come to mind. im not going to name any names, but they have been GREAT friends for what 2 years...more than two years? i dont even know....but they're not speaking to eachother, unless you consider bashing their brains out of eachother with their words.  it makes me sad because these people are my friends to. but i can do nothing about it. you see? i cant do anything about it except encourage them to stop fighting and be best buds again.  its stupid. and i think they realize its stupid. but its not stressin me out or anything...cuz it will PASS.  i dunno, i just got back from this happy go lucky vacation, and i go to places, and everyone just seems so down, aside from a few individuals.  i just want everyone to be happy and relax and have a good time in ur life.  you only live it once and i dont want you to regret worrying about other people's lives so much that you dont get a chance to live ur own.  CARPAY DIUM (its spelled wrong but its latin for SIEZE THE DAY!!!)

"event","so yeah..went to look at a jetta yesterday...very exciting....i really hope we have the best offer cuz i dont want it to be sold to anyone but me! went to kaka's, i drove. it was fun...but too short.  probably cuz i got there late, eh?  yeah lets see. o eric and i and a grand old talk last night...he just kinda left me standing (or sitting) there and logged off. it sucked, i cried, and i cant say i never cry anymore cuz i do now, and i dont like it.  not one bit.  it makes me feel shitty, and who likes to feel that way? absolutely no one.  i dunno. its not like anyone is gonna see this anyways, cept maybe eric, but eric if you read this, u've probably already heard this from me. so dont worry about it.  so yeah i dunno. i dont know how to help him. he needs to find himself, he lost him along the way to now.  i think im one of the big reasons he lost himself though, even though he might think otherwise.  i dunno, im not as good as i thought i was, or as he thinks i am. im just me. i dont know. i just wish it was like last year in the fall/summer. before homecomming.  no worries. infact i think the only reason that our relationship is any different now is probably because i screwed up.  i dunno. i know im not a good girlfriend. maybe im really the problem.  i think im jsut bad at relationships really.  not a good girlfriend, i just dont know if im doing the right thing. but i go with it anyways, thats the only thing i can do.  im just me.  if he doesnt want me, which i wouldnt blame him, then he can dump me.  i dont want him to though, but i think he wants to. maybe not. i hope not.  i just want him to be happy..with him.  if he's happy with him, then everything will follow.  he just needs to figure himself out.  thats something that i cant help him with. the only thing i can do is just be there for him, which i am, and i hope he knows it.  blah blah blah. i dont really feel good. my heads spinning, i need to eat something. yes food. mmmm.  god i just wish i wasnt so stupid.  girls night out tonight, maybe they can help me. im really excited about that. i was actually invited to one. they've had um before but i wasnt invited.  cuz im not a girl? lol i dunno but it will be fun hopefully i can forget about everything for a while and fill my tummy with food. i hope they dont ask me about eric though, cuz i'd just cry. like an idiot.  man. but at the same time i need to get it out of my system, which is why im writing this in the first place.  i dunno. what can i do? i just want him to love me....thats all...fart.  i love him, i know i do, hes my first love, and first are always hard to let go, says kaka from freshman year. lol...but i dont want to let him go. not at all. thats what i dont understand.  people would think im crazy if i have this much stress and im still with him, but i dont want NOT to be with him. i want to be with him. gahhhh im so confused.  you dont even know. little diary. i just want everything to be good. i wish he would hurry up and find himself. lol. jk.  he needs time. i just need to find out if he needs time with me or away from me. i think im gonna kidnap him for a bit. a day. just take him driving. me and him. car chats are always good.  yep, and its good cuz if he wanted to escape there's no where for him to go cept roll out on the road. muahhahahaa. but i hope nothing drives him to want to jump. although he's told me before that i make him want to kill himself. great. yeah im a good girlfriend alright, and monkies might fly out of my butt.  woooo.  man this is long. people think im retarded. cool i love that. eric if you read this talk to me if it bothers u cuz im hungry and tired and freakin and i dont even remember what i wrote at the top of the page so just dont hate me because i love you.

"event","Sarah here,
Its been a while. Today after sitting on my butt for hours i decided i might as well sit it down in front of the computer.  While at the computer i decided that i would come here see what people have been writing about. Maybe get a little insight on your guyses lives because i relized i have been cut off from the ""group"" lately.  Well while on here i was disturbed by the many bad things everyone had to say. I relized somthing this year. I had kind of a shitty year last year and i decided that worrying about other people and what they think and how i look to them is stupid. I think some of you should take that into consideration. It doesnt matter how pretty you are {although you all are pretty, so dont say you arnt!} or how smart you are. You should be yourself and not worry about others. Your all very special and i love everyone because there different. I mean what is pretty and perfect. I know that not being yourself is definatly not perfect so dont agree with people all the time. I am far from perfect and somedays i wish i was prettier or that more people liked me more but then i think to how crappy that made me feel last year. I relized I have great freinds. NO matter how distant they may seem somtimes. And am happy with myself. I hope you all can relize your all perfect the way you are, everyone loves hanging out with youguys, and i really hope everyone can be a little more possitive."

"event",".1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. 4 Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; 5 it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 6 it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 8 Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect; 10 but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood. 13 So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

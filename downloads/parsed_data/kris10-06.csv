"event","Well this is my first journal entry. I was a little worried about putting all my feelings and thoughts on the internet for everyone to see but I was eventually convinced by many of my friends to go ahead and let everything out.

WE BEAT KATY!! Our first playoff game of the season and my first ever! It was so exciting being there and cheering my teammates on, they deserve the best. They worked so hard and some have scars and bruises to prove it(H and Rachel). At the same time it was really hard to not be sad about not being able to play when thats what i worked for this whole season, frustration! I dont know i guess im glad i got hurt this year as opposed to next when it really counts just hopefully everything will go ok and ill be back soon! Thanks to all those who have been there for me and helped me and also to those that know what im going through (Cassie). 

Easter please come soon I need another break! 

well goodnight chiefs... much luv*"

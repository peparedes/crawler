A certain someone once said that she was ""starved of female companionship"". In my opinion, she probably only had her loud, boastful, self-centered whiny self to blame. Not that she will ever realize it, though... but then again, females are a very dangerous sort. There are the cunning, sly ones. The downright bitchy ones. The ones whom you should pray you never cross, because they will make your life a living hell if they choose to... so sometimes it really might be better if you just stick to yourself and the few people you'd trust with everything you've got.
I'm one of the luckier ones, i think? I have amazing friends. Do you have friends you love that much? Ones you'd do anything for? I hope you have one, at least... one isn't much, but that one person can be all you need, really."

Considering how i fared, i should be wallowing in my little pool of self-loathing and regret. Bitter, bitter, very bitter.. but whatever. Never been academically-inclined(and never will be).
It is nessa and raphael's birthday tomorrow. I like birthdays.. my brother's having a party at MacDonald's on saturday. I hope they'll give out a lot of french fries... just so i'll have something to do, to distract me from the annoying clown voices and screaming children which i will be fucking surrounded by for 2 whole hours. All of us are going out for nessa's birthday in the evening. We're going to have cake and ice cream. Not forgetting japanese wine *.* - that reminds me of fab, for some reason. He's adorable when he prances around the house making weird funny faces!!! and the special voice which he only uses on me he makes me want to eat him alive sometimes."

Stop fighting please stop fighting i don't want us to fight anymore you have no idea how much it hurts, every single fucking time. In anger in frustration people do tend to lose control of themselves with their frazzled minds and spinning thoughts you make me feel like a fucking monster sometimes. I wish you'd remember that i'm still only human. Am i not allowed to be angry? Words, words, we hurl words that burn back and forth. You are like a hurricane you suck me in you bleed me fucking dry you have no idea how much control you have over me - my heart, my mind.
We are like vultures we are like, lions silently circling each other the few moments before they throw themselves into a fierce fight stop please fucking stop it's killing me i am tired i feel so defeated i want to give up but there's no way that i can possibly do that because i have already given up so much to be with you. My pride my secrets my true inner fucking self, all because i love you. I love you with all i have the best i can every fucking day you make it seem as though you're blind to that very fact maybe it's because my best isn't good enough for you and if that's the case then i am sorry i am, sorry..
Forgive me please forgive me for i am completely at a loss now i don't know what to do you are my ocean, my web of lies of hope of sin of belief of trust my fucking future. Difficult so difficult we spit out bitter words we draw back we hold back we do everything but let go, you never do let me let things go you say i'm always running away, running away from problems but that is a part of me that has always been this way. I'm a fucking coward i cannot bear losing you but i am hopeless hopeless fucking hopeless i whisper apologies to you in the dark apologies that you think are results of my wanting to appease you because i am defeated i am my own army..."

""Living in your head, without anything to numb you"" 
I love songs with lyrics like these... songs that cut. Songs that make your skin prick. Songs that set you slightly more apart from everyone else. You know how on some days you just want to stay home, though you have a million other things to do? You get dressed, toss your make-up/wallet/mp3/water bottle into the same bag that you carried the day before(and the day before, and the week before that day, and the entire month before that week), take another fifteen minutes looking for something else to wear, till you're finally out and waiting for the bus when you close your eyes, sigh and walk back home? The things you have to do, the people you have to meet, they can wait. 

Do you have a new year's resolution? I do, but it really is kind of strange, for a.. resolution. It is: not be so nice anymore. I am tired of the attitudes(or lack of) of certain people around me and like gwen said, Maybe things will be different this time. Pretty words make things seem better for a little while, but that's just what they are. Pretty Words.

Tomorrow supposedly marks a beginning of sorts.... almost everybody will be counting down till midnight in 7 hours. 
Somewhere, someone will be rushing to be with his fiance after a late shift at work. He will stop to buy her roses, white roses. He will smile at the old lady who gives him his change, pockets it and runs across the street. 11.58, just two more minutes. Almost there... he sees her now. Her face softens, her lips curve into a smile. 11.59, almost there, almost there. ""Sorry i'm la-"" he never makes it across that road. His body is thrown onto the sidewalk, twisted, soaking in a dark pool of blood. Her screams will be lost in the sound of fireworks that explode in the sky, among the Happy-new-years as she runs to him. She will kneel down, holding him to her, choking on her tears. She will have lost the one thing closest to her heart and he will have died in her arms.
At 11.59 somewhere, an 18-year old girl will be sitting on her window ledge, looking up at the sky. She would have just swallowed all the pills that were left in the bottle. No more pain, because it will all end in a little while for her. She looks back at the room she's lived in all her life, the pictures hanging on her wall, the stash of CDs on her bed, her make-up on the dresser.. she will not need them anymore.
Someone, somewhere, will be spending his last new year's eve with his family. He only has a month left to live, but it isn't enough...... it never is, is it?
So much has happened this year. Both good and bad.. things that have made me cry, things that i want to just leave behind and move on.
But i won't, because we should always take a part of everything that has happened to us everywhere we go. It is what makes us that one, special person that we are to everyone else. There is a certain.... balance, of everything. Bad things happen, so you can fix it - or learn to. You meet people along the way, people that try to bring you down, people that make your life that much more miserable. Or you meet angels. Angels that stay for a little while, that make you feel like you are actually worth something.
You may be lonely for the most part of your life. Friends, you have those, but there is still a gap in your soul. A gap that yearns to be filled, but never will be, and you know it. You are never fully contented. You want more.
That is partly why you carry on living, though it hurts every single day. It hurts in little ways that you don't really notice, because you've grown too used to it that you don't even see it anymore. 
I will be with the people i love tonight. We're not going to be doing much, but that's not really so important, is it? A lot has changed....
Are you going to be up to anything tonight? If you're going to be alone, that's okay, too. You could stay up listening to your favorite song on repeat, with a glass of milk and a peanut butter sandwich. You could try to make a list of things that mean the most to you. Things you want to keep constant, things you want to change. You can make a phone call to that one person whom you haven't spoken to in quite awhile, or lose yourself in a book. ..
Or you can tell yourself it is just another day. You can go to bed at 11, then wake up tomorrow morning and spend the whole day in front of the television with cereal and juice. Whatever it is you are going to do, i hope that you'll find some sort of contentment. Even if it isn't much.

To the new year

"event","Gabriel has come home, bringing me the loveliest things from california, and I don't have to go to work till friday. I will be stuck in the company of hitler and the nazi party instead. Which is exactly why i am not looking forward to christmas. Not feeling it. I've got presents for a couple of people though.. 
Gwen and i shall be busy baking tomorrow afternoon. I cannot wait to see Chow Chow. He's a fuzzly bear.  
I hope you have a lovely christmas, reader. I have a feeling that I shall be a little more sad this year. It feels like I have, in a way, lost a friend. One who used to be closest to my heart. Her pretty words and pretense that nothing has happened between us just to keep it going isn't helping much. But then again, will is a very strong thing. Are you strong enough?
Merry Christmas everybody.... With love."

It ripples through me. Gently, violently..... mostly in-between. Every single day. It will never stop. 
What do we do now? What do.... I do?
Your words cut. I don't know, I don't know if I should believe you.
Don't come too close, now. It hurts and we need to breathe a little. I have enough to deal with, as it is... I am tired. Tired of trying, of knowing. Tired of how familiar frustration has become to me.
I am going to push everything out of my mind. Leave me alone."

I was rudely awakened an hour ago. Have been sitting here in front of the computer ever since with breakfast(which i cannot finish).
Gab is in L.A., now. I hope he takes lovely pictures.... Nessa hasn't replied my text yet, so i hope she does before 11. Which probably will not happen, since normal people only wake after 1.
So yesterday at work, my manager made me wear reindeer antlers(with bells on them)on my head. In the whole spirit of christmas? Gwen didn't get it so bad, though. She had to wear the red hat....this thing with a bob at the back. We still looked like idiots. We have to wear them all the way till christmas. Which is in about two weeks.
I am going to meet gwen by the river in ten minutes. With a tummy and a stubborn heart."

You walk up, up, up to the highest level. Up, past the dull red car, past the lonely bike parked in the far corner, past the ugly silver railings. Up, where there is no roof. Up where the sky hovers above, where the wide expanse of dark blue threatens to suck you in. Up where the rain lightly caresses you. Up where the birds and the wind and the spirits come to play.... do you like empty car parks as much as i do?"

I was doing the lunch shift on saturday when the chef stationed behind me told me that i was a Watermelon. Which, obviously, left me quite disturbed for the next few minutes. I would much rather have been called something nicer, such as.... I don't know, a blueberry, or something.
Eri-san hired gwen as well, so she's going to be working with me now... I shall no longer be the Odd New (and very lonely) Part-timer.
My friends are all leaving..they will come back in time, of course, but still. I'll miss them. Melanie, kc, gabriel..
Phuket was beautiful. I have a lot of pictures, but that can wait. As gab so aptly put it, my life is ""getting more filled up"". It isn't quite a good thing, actually. I really would prefer to just bum around everyday without having to go to work or anything.
It's a cold, cunning world out there... always changing. Nothing stops, nothing waits for you. People slip in and out of your life without you noticing."

Two days ago, I fell out of the 'Jobless' category. I start work next friday. I will be forced to don the hideous dull gray company uniform and exercise my social skills.
Neek came over yesterday and we spent quite some time fretting over the sudden loss of volume from the speakers, only to find that the main volume control was switched to Mute a few hours after. Actually... I'm not too sure about the 'we'. Knowing neek, she might have been the one who decided to switch it to Mute as an idea of a joke.
Have i mentioned how silly that girl is? :) I shall be flying off in a couple of hours...  Got to go find my travel-handy-toothbrush set that I KNOW I left somewhere around here..."

I spent most of the past week with fab, mich, mel and caroline :)
On a separate note, Lionel is going away to india for a whole year. I was there for about four days three years back. Four days, and i almost died. Ana and i felt like room service one night, so we decided on 'Drums of Heaven', which was supposed to be chicken drumsticks. Really good ones, considering how they added in 'Heaven'...... Not.
Think soggy vegetables stuffed in a badly molded floury dough of sorts. I never knew food from heaven tasted so awful.... must have missed the memo."

Remember how i said that love is a vicious cycle? I take that back. Nothing can get any worse than friendship. Friends are supposedly likened to angels, sent to you to make sure that you are never....completely alone in this cold, bitter world that we all live in.
So what happens when you hurt a friend?"

To sleep and forget. 
I do that, a lot... which really is becoming quite a bad habit. I push my emotions aside so easily, that when i actually want to Feel Something at some point, my mind only registers a general.... emptiness, a numbness of sorts?
To want to feel. Am i the only one who craves that...?"

The jealous mind tortures you, spins you madly around in the dark.
You don't want to show her how unhappy you are. It will just lead to the start of something else, something quite empty.. you don't want to go there. She's almost all you have, and you love her. You need her. Like how you always have.. Her words send hurt racing down your chest, your back. Racing through your head. Stop. It really is quite enough, you just want things to fall back into place again. Jealousy plays with you still.."

Oh, and my sweet, sweet, motivation....where for art thou?  In all seriousness--I have a shit ton of things to get done, deadlines to meet, and adult responsibilities to resume, and yet no desire to do any of them.  Please let me find my driving force soon.  Throwing myself into my work would definitely be a decent distraction right about now."

"event","I've been waiting to watch John Mayer on Storytellers all week.  I've heard he's an asshole and that may or may not be true but that doesn't change the fact that I love his music.  It means so much more when an artist has taken the time to write their own songs...you can honestly tell, you can feel that they've put a part of themselves into it.  And some days, even after listening to a song hundreds of times, you wake up and listen to that same song and it suddenly makes sense.  Or maybe it just makes sense in a way you never thought it would.

Anyway, before playing Who Says, Mayer discusses his reasoning behind the song.  How the song is standing up to all of the bullies in the world and the inner bullies too.  The fact of the matter is, I need to stop caring so much about what people think or feel about me.  Granted there are times when I should be aware of how my words/actions affect those around me, but when it comes to me just being me, being true to myself, I shouldn't give a shit. I can't make everyone happy 100% of the time. Who Says I can't be me."

It seems like the characters were just introduced and that endless possibilities are sure to follow.  I'm worried that he's already a workaholic though.  The fact that he's driven and working his ass off to get where he wants to be is fantastic, but it also freaks me out in that I fear that maybe he never will have/make the time for me.  And if  that's the case--I need to cut the cord before it's too late.

If it doesn't work out, I'll keep my chin up.  My career is a priority too but unless I have someone to share it with it doesn't seem as important."

"event","Who ever said you can't run away from your problems was seriously misinformed.  Things with the guys definitely hit the fan today.  I was truly hurt and upset with a friend I've had for seventeen years.  I blew up and expressed my feelings to both of them--I'm pretty sure that one of them understood where I was coming from and apologized but the one that I've known forever, who I care so much for, really didn't get it.  He's still too concerned about being a people-pleaser and spreading himself as thin as humanly possible.  I guess now I have to accept the fact that this is how it's going to be.  I obviously can't change who he is.

Right now I wish that I could go on a mini vacation.  I wish that I could put everything on hold, freeze time if you will (oh, I will), and escape to another place.  I feel that my mind and heart/emotions are entitled to some time away from here.  I'm sick of the lack of communication that my group of friends is exhibiting.  The lack of love and respect for one another.  It's really sad, and it hurts to see it happen.  I don't want to burn bridges with the friends that I've made.

When relaying all of tonight's events with my one roommate, I got the feeling that she thought I was being selfish.  I could see it all over her face.  I really hope that's not the case and now I can't stop thinking about it.  The fact of that matter is; I don't feel that the situation is fair.  Nobody should be putting the effort into a friendship to have it all blow-up in their face.  I need to just let this whole thing go.  What's done is done.  I'm glad I finally spoke my peace."

"event","I fear that our group of friends is about to ""go on a break."" 

I don't know when or how it happened, but something tells me that if there weren't couples this wouldn't be happening.  There is just so much drama, bull shit, and people putting their noses in each other's business.  I miss last year.  I miss the guys being right downstairs, drinking spontaneously, watching movies at 3 am and playing football.  Steph was definitely right when she said that everything was changing and it would never go back to that again.  Most of the time I'm completely okay with growing up, in fact I usually I support it... But when crap like this happens, with people growing apart and treating each other like dirt for no apparent reason, I despise it!  I hate feeling like a stranger in my own home or around my friends.  It seems like only the couples can hang out with each other and the rest of us are the odd ones out.  The holiday season is supposed to bring about togetherness, I hope it happens.  I already miss him and to feel like my friends are in their own little world makes the loneliness even harder.  I think spending time at home with my family is necessary--I need to get away from here before the shit hits the fan!

"event","Time is literally flying by this school year.  I can't believe I'm only a year and a half away from being pushed out of the nest and soaring into the real world.  School is going really well--I can't wait to put everything I'm learning into practice.  To recap (for my future self):
-Spending time in Venice for Thanksgiving was actually really nice.  I didn't have any distractions and got to spend a good amount of time catching up with my family.  It's nice coming home not as often--makes you appreciate it a lot more.  Venice is Venice, but Orlando is definitely becoming the place that I want to live after graduation.
-The family is good---mom and her beau are doing well...I suppose.  I've gotten more use to him being around but I honestly don't have a lot to say to him.  I get along with him and all--and mom seems happy, so that's what truly matters.  I'm glad that he's not mooching off of her, like I was fearing, and that they've worked out some sort of billing situation. :)  Having said this, I'm still not a big fan of the macho man that he tries to be.  He's apparently been everywhere and done everything and has no problem telling you about it...gag.
-Boys....they're &quot;special&quot;...I think that's the nicest way of putting it.  I've decided that the one I have/had tends to be incredibly one track minded and has difficulties balancing different aspects of his life.  Our &quot;relationship&quot; has becoming another &quot;responsibility&quot; for him--one he can't handle at the moment. He was constantly feeling guilty for his lack of availability, which in turn made me feel guilty.  He needs to focus on his career right now, and for that I say &quot;more power to ya!&quot;  It hurts, I'm not gonna sugar coat it.  He is by far one of the sweetest and most respectful men I've dated.  He makes me laugh and makes me want to be a better person when he's around.  He himself has said that we've already created a strong foundation of a friendship.  Unfortunately, a relationship is just not in the cards right now.  Part of me feels like a weight has been lifted--I was so busy being the eternal optimist.  But at the same time, I miss him.  And I'm so afraid that if I tell him that he'll think I'm holding onto something that I shouldn't and he'll push himself away.

Either way, life is pretty great right now.  Good friends, good family, good environment.  I'm thankful for what I've had and what I have at this moment.  It's amazing how the tiniest events all add up to make a bigger picture--I think I'm beginning to cherish the little things; the moments with the people that I care about and who care about me in return.<br type=""_moz"" />"

As far as my boy department is concerned:&nbsp; one guy is too busy with his career right now (which I&nbsp;think is great) but we haven't had any time with just the two of us yet.&nbsp; I'm worried that this could be really great but unless we are given an opportunity for it to grow and let a relationship start to form, I fear that it will simply stall out on this plateau that it has reached.&nbsp; The other guy I see all the time.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he is mending a broken heart at the moment.&nbsp; I don't want to make a move out of fear that if anything I&nbsp;will be the rebound girl.&nbsp; I've always felt something between us--I&nbsp;passed it off as nothingworth noting (probably because he was always with the girlfriend) but my friends have always said differently.&nbsp; He's the perfect mix of two things I love:&nbsp; theatre and sports, but I&nbsp;really don't want to jump the gun.

I feel like I'm stuck at a fork in the road.&nbsp; I've lost my map and the only compass I&nbsp;have is my heart which quite frankly doesn't know what to do.&nbsp; I've decided that I've already come this far and now it's up to them to meet me the other half of the way.&nbsp; I'm not afraid of making the journey on my own but it would be awfully nice to have some company."

"event","Like most people I know, I have definitely neglected livejournal this summer.&nbsp; I've kept myself busy:&nbsp; trip to NYC, teaching children (of the corn) at two different locations, spending nights either at the beach, pool, or watching movies courtesy &nbsp;of Netflix...Soon Amber will be living with me and then before we know it we'll be back in Whorelando in our new big girl apartment.&nbsp; Seriously though, August 10th can't come soon enough.

There have already been some speed bumps this summer.&nbsp; Nothing too severe---I caused most of them and have either slapped myself for creating the situations in the first place or yelled at myself for getting involved with things that are none of my business.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hate the fact that I usually feel like I'm on the road to being a responsible adult and then I&nbsp;relapse and go and do something that inevitably hurts myself and someone else who I care about.

Other than minor missteps along the way---summer has been relaxing and eye opening.&nbsp; Mom has made it clear to me that she is completely okay with me never returning to Venice to live, and I'm okay with that too.&nbsp; For some reason I&nbsp;think I'll end up living in a state I&nbsp;never thought I'd reside in.&nbsp; I'm just going to go wherever I'm needed and where I&nbsp;feel happy.&nbsp; As I&nbsp;was cleaning the other day I opened my senior year book just to look back at how things have already changed only 2 years after graduation.&nbsp; There's a page where myself and several of my friends are quoted with where we think we'll be in 10 years.&nbsp; One of my closest friends said that he'd &quot;be back at &nbsp;Venice teaching at the high school.&quot;&nbsp; If you asked him the same question today I'm sure that Venice wouldn't even be in the top 10 places he wants to end up.&nbsp; It blows my mind how one life choice (in this case going to college) can completely alter where your life goes.&nbsp; The people you meet, the places you go, the things you experience gradually steer your life in a new direction.&nbsp; And I can confidently say that I am 100% okay with that.

As far as guy world is concerned, no one here has captured my attention, and part of that is because I don't want them to.&nbsp; I've kept in contact with the guy I met in Orlando.&nbsp; He really wants to come down and visit but right now he's back home visiting his family so I'm not too worried about it.&nbsp; This is the first time that I'm not over analyzing and freaking out over a guy and how I can't control the situation.&nbsp; I miss him, of course I&nbsp;do, but I want this to just run its course.&nbsp; I like him and he likes me.&nbsp; If our bond is strong enough we'll make it work.&nbsp; Now that he's graduated there's no way of knowing where his job will take him--I've already made it clear that I'm not going to beg him to stay in Orlando, even though the selfish part of me who really cares about him wants him to.&nbsp; Deep down, it feels right,&nbsp;and I&nbsp;just hope that we get some sort of chance to see if this could be something great.

"event","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate the fact that you thought I hadn't missed you at all since&nbsp;I've been away at&nbsp;school.&nbsp; Truth&nbsp;be told, you are one of the people I&nbsp;always wished was here.&nbsp; I know there are no excuses as to&nbsp;why I never called as much as I should have--and I am&nbsp;not going to try to pass the buck and say, "" it works both ways.""&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, college has been a life changing thing.&nbsp; Yes, I have met new people and faced new challenges.&nbsp; This does not erase the friendship and adventures we've shared together.&nbsp; The life I lead in Orlando is different from the one in Venice--as much as I have fun up here I'm also here to get an education and move on.&nbsp; I didn't want too many distractions, and as you know, not all distractions are bad ones.&nbsp; I guess I was scared that we would have a repeat of what happened in October.&nbsp; The ""dark times"" were horrible, for both of us, and for some reason I feared that we would sink back into that again since I obviously wasn't able to pay you the kind of attention I though you deserved.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry if I hurt you while I was away.&nbsp; If you felt left out, or not wanted--that wasn't my intention at all.&nbsp; I want you to know that you can talk to me whenever about whatever you need to.&nbsp; Things are going to be easier when I am home---and I promise that next year I will try to be a better friend to you than I was this year.&nbsp; I was selfish.&nbsp; I&nbsp; wanted to focus on life up here whole-heartedly.&nbsp; I wasn't trying to break ties with you or Venice---I was just ready to move on from somethings and make new ties here.&nbsp; </p><p>Please forgive me,</p><p>-P</p>"

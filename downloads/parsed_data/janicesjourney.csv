It is with great sorrow to tell you that my Mom has lost her, almost 3 year battle, with cancer. 

I am content in saying that she did not suffer, was not in pain, and was surrounded by her close family and dear friend Gail when the time had to come.

My Mom was a true fighter.  She never gave up fighting, even in the end.  I know you all have a good memory with my Mother, and I hope you continue to remember... she always remembered all of you.

Thank you to each and every one of you for the support you showed her.  She loved this journal, and I think it was having all of your support that made her fight so hard.

I speak on behalf of her entire family when I say she will be missed dearly, but will NEVER be forgotten.

Rest in Peace dear Mother.  We all love you.

I miss you already,
Jennifer xoxo

I wanted to do a quick update on behalf of Mom, as I know many of you are wondering how she is doing.  Mom is currently in the hospital and working very hard to fight this terrible disease.  Our family needs all of the thoughts and prayers out there, so please send them our way.

Please respect the fact my Mother would want to stay private during this difficult time.  No visitors unless it is cleared by the family, she wants it this way.

You have all been a wonderful support for my Mother, and I can't thank you all enough.  Please continue this support.  I will try to update as often as I can.

Lots of Love from my Mother (and her family)...

Keep me in your thoughts and prayers and we'll hope for the beast.  Not up to visitors at this time but comment on my journal.

Sorry for the lack of communication for a while.  I've not been feeling well and ended up in the hospital again last week from Monday til Thursday.  I had severe pain.  The tumors have grown again in the liver and I need to get back on chemo soon.  I see my Oncologist Aug 7 so we'll see what she has to say.  I have to get my pain medication regulated as well.  I'm feeling a little better today, one day at a time.  Keep me in your thoughts and prayers and this too will pass and I'll be good as new.

This has been an up and down week for me.  Good days and bad.  Today's not so great again, oh well, there's always tomorrow.  Nothing much exciting happening in my world.  My cousin Lorna lost her Mother-in-law this week and to her and her family my deepest sympathy.  She will be missed, especially by her four legged companion.  I got out for lunch on Friday and had a good time.
Today Rick and I went to the cemetary and placed some pretty flowers on Jeff's grave.  I know he's thanking me.
This weekend coming Jennifer is looking after Taylyn for the weekend and I'm helping out Friday and Saturday nite, with Grampa's help.  She's such a sweetie!
I enjoy hearing from you all and please keep those comments coming my way, they sure put a smile on my face.  Keep in touch and maybe we'll run into one another real soon.

It's been a while and I do appoligize.  My commputer was in for repairs this week but that's really no excuse for the previous weeks.
I just finished watching Farrah's Story for the second time, Farrah Fawcett of course, who passed away yesterday.  I can so relate to her journey.  I do admire the strength and hope that she had to want to live.  It's rough you know when they inject all of these chemicals and other drugs and expect your life to be normal.  It's not easy to keep that smile on your face and happiness in your voice, but you do it for everyone else. I'm still feeling pain free right now. The gal bladder has settled down and the liver is still stable.  The colon is making sure everything comes out right, if you know what I mean.  I am so fatigued every day and it's difficult.  I still make sure I look after the bed and the house and the meals and Rick's lunch for work.  He does the laundry as I don't do stairs very much.  I'm going to start the clinical trial after the end of July, or as soon as one becomes available.  I am so lucky for all of the good things in my life.  A great husband, wonderful kids, a darling granddaughter, great relatives and top knotch friends and co-workers.  You are all of the people that inspire me to do my best.
Enough of this sadness for today.
Jennifer and I went to Taylyn's dance recital 3 weeks ago and she was wonderful.  The best little dancer there.  She saw me sitting in the audience and waved and mouthed that she loved me.  Oh...........so sweet.  
I hope this posting finds everyone well.  Keep me in your thoughts and prayers.  I may come to CT for a visit, but possibly the next time I might have to use a wheelchair as the old legs just get way too tired and I usually cover way too many miles.  I might be looking for a pusher, for my wheelchair that is.  I miss you all.

I've not been feeling so well since Friday night.  I've been having some pains, it's either my liver or gal bladder acting up.  Waiting for results of blood work.
I've been kind of sad as well, it's been a year since we lost our Jeffrey.  Time sure flies.  We have lots of good memories and of course his beautiful daughter.  Taylyn is performing in her first dance recital this weekend at Centennial.  Looking forward to this one.
Yesterday I went to Hamilton to see about a clinical and it looks like I'm going to give it a try.  I'm going to start out at Phase one as my health is generally strong.  There is a very small success rate, however I have my own success rate going on.  I will maybe be paving the way for someone else with Colon cancer.  This is a good thing.
I'm feeling better and stronger every day, so whatever I have is getting better.

Hope everyone is well.
Lots of love.

The past 2 weeks I haven't been feeling so great.  I've had a lot of discomfort, but that seems to have cleared up and I'm feeling much better.  I go next Tuesday, June the 9th for a colsoltation with a clinical trial Doctor in Hamilton at the Jurvanski Cancer Center.  Will have to wait and see what they have to say.
Rick and I went shopping in the USA on Saturday past, had a good time.  Stayed away from the casino though.  I have to know my limitations for the slot machines as well.

I saw my Oncologist yesterday and got some good news.  My tumors on the liver have decreased since I finished treatment in March.  I did not qualify for the Clinical Trial however.  She did tell me there are more trials going on in Hamilton and she would like to refer me for a consoltation while I am feeling strong.  So we will wait for that appointment and see what they have to say.  I don't go back to my Oncologist for 2 months.  I get a break.  I am feeling strong, but need to know my limitations.  Sometimes I push myself too far and then I pay the price of exhaustion.  Oh well!

On Tuesday I had my final treatment of this round, til the next time.  Once the tumors on my liver start acting up, we""ll have to go there again.  Let's hope they stay dormant for a while.  I also had a problem with my PICC line.  It came out 15cms.  My arm and shoulder are killing me, but I will live.  I went back to the hospital on Tuesday and they stopped the 46 hour treatment and removed the PICC line.  So I finished one day earlier.  What a treat!
I'm not feeling too bad actually.  I'm even doing a little bit of house cleaning.  Just about to start using my girlfriend.
Today was the big day for Jennifer, she moved out.  Now with her and Jason both gone, Rick and I are empty nesters.  I told Rick he can start walking around naked if he likes.  Especially when I'm not feeling so well, it might perk me up.  Who knows.  He wasn't too keen on the idea anyhow.
I hope this posting finds everyone well.  Take care.

I had my treatment last week.  Things went pretty good.  I'm a little under the weather, but that's to be expected.  I got good news from the Doctor regarding my Cat Scan.  I'm stable.  This is good, the tumors are unchanged, but I still had 2 treatments after the cat scan.  I'm done on the 31st of March and I get to have a break.  Yahooooo!  Hopefully it will be longer than the last, but I'll take whatever I get.  I look forward to having the Picc Line removed and I will then be able to shower as per normal.  I am very lucky and I know it.
The insulin has not been going so bad.  I'm still trying to get regulated, but I'm sure the chemo is also playing havoc on that as well.  My vision is screwed up, possibly from the way my glocose was out of control.  I'm wearing my bifocals constantly, if I want to see.  You really have to take care of yourself, I'm finding out the hardway.
Tomorrow is my big day, 54 years young!  Wow!  Two years ago April they didn't give me much hope, but haha the jokes on them, cause I'm not going anywhere yet.  I've still got lots to do.  
Have a good day tomorrow and keep on sending me your messages.  They make my day!

Hello everyone, sorry it's been so long.  I wasn't really feeling well the last couple of months.  It's seems the anti nausea pill I was taking this round of treatment can cause your blood glucose to go out of wack.  My sugars had been running in the high 20's or so.  I just got home yesterday from 10 days in the hospital.  I'm now taking insulin by needle.  It's not so bad, and I'm also feeling much better. My energy is back and my appetite has also improved and I'm eating much better, also because I have to.
I have my next treatment tomorrow 3/17/09 and the final one is scheduled for 3/31/09, and then I get a break, I hope.
I hope everyone is well, I've missed you all.  I'm doing much, much better now and ready to tackle these last 2 treatments.  I had my Cat Scan while in the hospital and am hoping for great results.

A very nice tradition that still continues after all these years.  We are very lucky employees to still receive a gift such as this.  And of course, visit I did.  2 1.2 hours later we finally made our way home.  I think Delaine will think twice about going with me again to CT.

Asked my family Doctor lots of questions and he advised me that I am a miracle and to just enjoy it and not to worry about anything.  My appointment with the surgeon was cancelled til next week.  So I'll have to update then.
I have Taylyn for the weekend and we're having lots of fun.  Last nite we sang Christmas carols and she made up lots of new songs along the way.  When she didn't know what to sing, she just threw in a lalalala!  What a laugh we both had.
Tonite we're going to go to Niagara Falls and see the Festival of Lights.  I'm sure she'll enjoy that as well.  She thought we should also go to the ice cream store.  Sounds like a good idea, but it's a little too cold for that.

Tomorrow is our special princesses birthday, #4 for Taylyn.  We're having a little celebration here and she's having her party on Saturday with her friends.  I'm so proud of the little person she's become.
As the title indicates, we've had a secret Halloween guy in our neighbourhood that takes away pumpkins and returns them fully carved.   Not a bad job and no mess left to clean up.  What more could you want.  My daughter Jennifer thought it was the coolest and reported it to the Tribune.

Well, as usual I have recovered from my chemo treatment.  When you're in the middle of it all, it seems like you will never get well again and all the troubles of the world pile upon you.  But as they say, ""this to shall pass"", and it does.  Thank goodness.
We had a nice time at the wedding on Saturday.  It was very elegant and Lindsay's parents should be so proud.  On Sunday Jennifer and I picked up Taylyn in Fort Erie and brought her here for the day and over night.  We stopped at a pumpkin patch along Netherby Road and she had a good time.  Dinner was fabulous at my cousin Susan's.  There wasn't a thing missing and of course I ate too much.  At the wedding I splurged and did something from my bucket list.  I sampled a Martini at the Martini Bar.  Just a taste.  It wasn't that great, but oh well, I can at least say I've tried one.
Today I have a check up with my family Doctor.  I'm feeling well today and ready to tackle the world.  Have a good week and one more treatment to go, I hope.

Lots of Love
Janice"

Another treatment completed, one down and one to go.  I can hardly wait.  I'm not feeling too bad tonite, however I know tomorrow is a write off, a good day to stay in my bed.  How I apprectiate my good fortune, good friends and good family.  Everyone is so kind.  I don't know how to thank my dear friend Gail who has supported me in a special way, taking me to my treatments like she does.  Everyone deserves a Gail in their lives.
This is going to be a busy weekend.  We have a wedding to attend on Saturday and I'm looking forward to spending Thanksgiving at my cousin Susan's house along with her whole family and we will also have Taylyn with us and for overnite.  What a treat!
I wish everyone a special Thanksgiving and an opportunity to be thankful for all of your blessings.  I know I am.  I've struggled along on my Journey and I'm still here!

God bless everyone and lots on love!

Well, I've completed another treatment and possibly 2 more to go.  I can hardly wait.  This week has not been uneventful to say the least.  My back is feeling better since the tumble out of the shower and on Tuesday night while getting in the bed, Rick decided to roll over and banged me in the temple with his elbow.  Boy did that hurt and I'm left with a nice bruise on my forhead.  What next!
I'm feeling much better this weekend.  Rick and I went to the cemetary today.  I'm cooking a nice dinner for supper and look forward to watching the Amazing Race and Brothers and Sisters tonite on the television.
I don't have any plans for the week as of yet, but anythings possible.

Have a good week!

Went to see my surgeon at McMaster today for a check up and every thing is in great shape and doing what it's supposed to do.  The stent is ok.  I was a little worried as I haven't felt the greatest, but no need to worry.
The wig shopping has been put on hold as the hair seems to have stopped falling out.  They call it a little thinning.  So I'll have to wait to find out if blonds have more fun Annette.  So nice to hear from my CT Family today.  You really cheer me up.
As it stands now, possibly 6 more weeks of chemo, or 3 treatments if all goes well.  I can hardly wait.
My tail bone is killing me and I'm now sitting on a styrafoam donut which seems to ease things a bit.  No one does things as good as me.  I can only imagine what Rick must have thought as he came racing into the bathroom last Friday.  I just laid on the floor and laughed myself, and said ""what next?""
I'll be fine and I'm not going anywhere just yet any time soon and the butt will heal in time and I've got lots of that.

Take care and have a great weekend.

Lots of Love

My treatment went as per usual and I felt horrible on Thursday and Friday.  On Friday night I decided to have a shower at about 10pm and slipped and fell head first on to the bathroom floor.  With shampoo dripping in my eyes and the shower curtain drapped over my soaking wet body and Rick coming to my rescue, all I could do was laugh.  What more could go wrong for me?  My tail bone is bruised and very sore but other than that I'm ok.  I'm having great difficulty walking but it could have been much worse.
Needless to say, I've spent a very quiet and lazy weekend and hope that as the week progresses, I'll start feeling better.  My Oncologist says possibly 3 more treatments, which will take me til the end of October.  She was very pleased with my August Cat Scan.  I can only keep praying for good results and have another winter break from this dreaded chemo.  I'm also going to look for a wig on Monday or Tuesday.  In the medical world it's known as a cranial prostesis.  Lucky me!
Keep me in your thoughts and prayers, I need all that I can get right now.

I've been feeling so, so this week.  Another problem has occured that I'm not too thrilled about, my hair is falling out.  How disgusting!!!!!  I guess it's not the end of the world, but I'm really disappointed.  We'll see what the Doctor has to say on Wednesday at my next treatment.

I hope everyone had a good Sunday.  A nice day for the end of the week.  All is well with me.  I had a quiet evening at home Friday, while Rick and Jason went to Zooz for the Pink Floyd concert.  Not my cup of tea.  Saturday night we went to Lindsay Skelton's stag and doe.  Had a nice time.  I ate too much, too late.  When will I ever learn.  Today we went out for dinner to DJ's.  That's the place to go if you like fish & chips.
Taylyn is in Florida with her Mom and she phoned me on Saturday to tell me what a good time she is having.  She got to see all the Princesses and she is in her glory.  What a lucky kid.  I hope they have a blast.  We miss her though.
This is count down week to more chemo on Wednesday.  I'm dreading it.  But as I say, What you have to do to live these days.
I hope this posting finds every well and in good health.  I think of you all often.  Have a great week.

This past Wednesday I started my new chemo, Avastin along with a couple of other new ones.  It's really taken its toll on me and I'm really whacked right out.  Today I'm a little stronger, but could just curl up in a ball and go to sleep.  My appetite also sucks.  The Doctor is expecting great results for me however and this is the only good to come out of it.  I pray for a break from this rotten chemo, maybe 1 or 2 years or more would be good for a start.  I'm so optimistic aren't I?  Wednesday was also a long day, over 7 hours at the hospital.  My good friend Gail is such a God send.  I don't know what I'd do without her.
This journey is quite the ride and I'm really ready to get off real soon.
Hope everyone is well.  I miss you all and appreciate all of your comments and e-mails.
Have a good weekend and pray for my strength to return.

All is well this weekend.  I've had Taylyn since Friday and she's staying til Monday.  We're busy watching and singing to Hannah Montanah.  She's really growing up these days and talking about her Daddy lots.  Sometimes this brings tears to my eyes, but they are good tears.  We miss her Daddy so very much.

My treatment went well and I got some good news.  My Oncologist wants to start me on the new wonder-drug call Avastin.  Up until recently the Gov't wasn't paying for this drug and it cost thousnands of dollars per dose.  Now the Gov't will pay for it and I qualify, not that I feel I need it, as I respond well to the regular stuff.  I'm feeling well and have been busy.  Yesterday I was invited out for dinner and again today am invited out for dinner.  Next weekend appears to be the same.  Great.....I don't have to cook.
I had my Cat Scan on Friday instead of the 20th to get this process started early.  Pray for great news and improvement.  I know I am.
Enjoy the great weather and your family time.  Look forward to your comments and I hope to see my CT family next week, as this week really got away from me.  I miss you all.

Well, I have completed another chemo treatment and I guess I might be 1/2 way to completion.  They are setting up an appointment for a Cat Scan to see the good work going on inside me.  It won't be for a few weeks yet, but that's ok, better results I hope.  I'm feeling not too bad today.  Got myself a pedicure this afternoon and just about broke my right foot.  I slipped in the soaking basin.  What a klutz I can be!  The foot's sore and bruised but the nails look good.  Oh well!
I lost a co-worker this week to cancer, Dave Bird.  How sad.  His son was getting married today.  I hope they realize Dave is at peace, even though he will be dearly missed.  CT lost a good employee.  We also lost Don Smith from CT this past week.  My sympathies to his family and friends.
Tomorrow will be a lazy day for me and I'm going to have Taylyn for a visit on Tuesday.  She is so smart, if I do say so myself.  She told me a story last week about her Mommy taking her to the park.  I asked her what they did there and she told me Mommy pushed her on the swing.  She pushed her higher and higher and then said guess what? to me.  I replied, What?  And she said maybe Daddy will catch me!  Of course I started to cry, but then replied, of course Daddy will catch you, he'll never let you fall down.
Kids say they greatest things!
Have a good weekend.

Hope everyone likes the pictures from the Relay.  My team is all very proud and we had a great time.  Can't wait for next year.
I'm feeling better since my chemo treatment last Wednesday.  It really knocks the heck out of you and then it's like someone waves a magic wand and you return to your old self for a few days.  Then the immune system is gone and you're knocked out again for a number of days.  Then you recover for a few more and it's chemo time again.  What a rollercoaster!  The Doctor said possibly only 8 treatments, or 4 months, and that will be done in September.  I can hardly wait.
Time moves on and on and on!  It's almost a month since my son past away and I'm still having a hard time.  I miss him so!  Our daily phone calls and weekly visits.  Our laughs with one another.  I still can't believe he's gone.  He's at peace though and this is good.  
Enjoy your weekend and maybe I'll see some of you this week.  We're planning a girl's luncheon at Anna Olson's this Thursday and that I'm looking forward to.  I may also visit at CT this week.  Try not to make me cry!

But I guess it's really not the end of the world and it's really not so bad.  I do have my friend Gail with me there as always and I'd be lost without her.

I've been feeling rather run down since the last treatment.  I had Taylyn last nite for a sleepover and that was fun.
I'm still feeling very proud of myself and Janice's Journey Girls for doing the Relay for Life and the fact that I pulled an all-nighter.  Haven't done one of those in about 30 years.  Not bad what the old girl is made of.  I'm going to try and post some relay pictures.  Don't hold your breath though, if they don't show up, I'll have my tech person help me out.

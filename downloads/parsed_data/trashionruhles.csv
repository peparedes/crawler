"event","Something is wrong with the water in my room.  It keeps dissolving the bottom of my cups, and my sink is eroding.  I should sue.  I have no water in my room that isn't potentially harmful.  On the other hand, if one of you little snotrags spiked my water supply, you better start practicing holding your breath.  I will find out.

Apparently there was a pool party?  Well.  It would be nice next time if you all had the courtesy to drown.

Father bought me a 'congratulations for not getting your arse expelled' present.  Which I'm not going to say no to, but it's not like I haven't been trying to get expelled.  She'll be arriving some time this week, I'm told.  Finally I can say goodbye to public transportation."

Unless somebody stole them, in which case they're going to lose them again very, very quickly and possibly some skin from their feet also.

Anyway.  I know where I want to get married.  I want to rent out a museum for it.  Also my stupid brother and his stupid girlfriend apparently have to come along?  According to my parents.  Well...whatever.  I don't care as long as we don't have to talk.  We never got along."

"event","I have absolutely no idea why my parents decided to visit 'for Thanksgiving'.  We are British for god's sake.  Thanksgiving is just a hypocritical holiday where fat Americans get even fatter.  And besides, I don't cook.  So we had caterers in.  But the highlight of the visit, and by highlight I mean I'm still throwing up a little in my mouth about it, is when Mummy and Daddy walked in on Howie building that ridiculous and unnessesary robotic cock for Chavez.  Because that is obviously going to make everything better.  It was rotating on the table.  And of course my parents didn't believe the explination, and then later after a few to many drinks my mother informs me that she too used to 'strap it on back in the day'.  Which is revolting to the point where I might just be mentally scarred right now.  Daddy is rather fat.

It turns out they just wanted to congratulate us about the engagement and give us early wedding presents.  I have a new car.  And I'd like to see anyone even try and get to this one.

I also got a phonecall.  Long story short, <i>Fierce</i> magazine wants to employ me to drag their sorry publication up from no-sale hell.  They saw my previous work.  So I figure, why the bloody hell not?  Everybody needs a hobby.  Just you wait, this magazine is going to soar to the top of the fashion world and catscratch the living daylights out of everything below it.  It's hardly a challenge - I know it's going to happen.  That sad little mag is going to get such a hard revamp it'll be knocked round the world twice and back again.

But before I begin.  I need a PA.  I need a photographer.  And I need models.  The first two should know who you are and are getting the hint, and the third...christ.  I am not using Tang.  He will always be Big-Nosed Photocopy Guy to me.  And I am definitely not using Choly.

I need to make a presentation."

<b>AT THE WEDDING RECEPTION</b>

<i>TheAmazingBeckna: well they should have at least been bitching about how ridiculous everyone else looked at the wedding and how cheap beach weddings are
walentios yeah: haha yeah!!</i>


<b>Harle:</b> who in their right mind would get married somewhere where your heels get stuck in the floor

<b>Brendon:</b> and sand where the sun doesn't shine...I thought weddings were supposed to be fun and magical...so far none  of the weddings we've attendedhave been any good...D< pass the bacardi...

<b>Harle:</b> seriously the first one looked like it was planned by 12 year old boys - oh wait, quentim pretty much is one - and this one has a budget of about twenty seven pence *pours massive drinks of massive for them both*

<b>Brendon:</b> He's about five twelve year old boys all jammed into one skin tight jump suit...so from the get go...that was never going to be entirely magical...there was a budget..?I thought this was all done on whatever they could find in their pockets...so probably a horible tiki pendant...some pebbles...and surf board wax...

<b>Harle:</b> and maybe a little money that was supposed to go towards buying condoms, because we all know how careful they are.

<b>Brendon:</b> Isn't that the only reason they are having this wedding..?

<b>Harle:</b> Probably.  It's sad really.  For the kids, I mean.  because when this goes to pieces they'll blame themselves and before they know it they'll be on maury asking who the daddy of their own babies is.  And then it will turn out to be the same father for both of them.

<b>Brendon:</b> Please...Maury..? That is far too high end for them...it'll be Jerry...and we'll all be hoping that at least all of them will be hit with a chair...

<b>Harle:</b> That might help their faces.  I mean with those parents the children won't be attractive.  She looks like Malibu Barbie from the reject line, and his nose looks like it greeted a wall extremely enthusiastically.  It'd be cheaper than surgery.

<b>Brendon:</b> Cheaper would just be to abort now...although they are clearly both cheap dates...cause there is no excuse for that...apart from beer goggles...or desperation...

<b>Harle:</b> Well who else would take them.  It's either that or they both end up marrying.....dophins. *hicup-burp*

<b>Brendon:</b> :Q


<i>TheAmazingBeckna: hahahahaha XDD
walentios yeah: :3
TheAmazingBeckna: I like how they magically knew it was twins lolz</i>


<b>Brendon:</b> well who doesnt with a bump that size...or that is one fat ass baby...

<b>Harle:</b> Oh god not another QUENTIM -_-

<b>Brendon:</b> eww~

Now award ceremonies are different. Especially since I know I'm going with a winner. I've already booked my hair appointment for the event. And I know exactly what I want done. As usual. 

Brendon, my coffee wasn't hot enough this morning. I have to say I think I'm getting withdrawl symptoms from firing people. So I fired my fax machine for jamming again and got a new one.

So.  Who has an interesting story for me."

I'm sorry but sweetie, we do not pay you to sit around and cry on the phone to your mummy about how mean your new boss is. That phone is for handling calls to me. Cry on your own time. I mean really. You need balls of steel to work in the fashion industry, so it's no wonder you were cut from the team. 

She made an awful cup of coffee, too. 

Anyway. Apart from that it wasn't a bad day. The photographer was terrible, though. He kept re-dressing my models. So Codii, sweetie I need you back here ASAP because at least any changes you make is for the sake of the photo and not because you're not a fan of neon. 

Brendon. You have a deadline tomorrow. So don't forget. Or you'll be joining Sophie. 

Now with all that out of the way, I have to watch the recording of Howie's show today. I couldn't watch it live at work because of a meeting. And by meting I mean an hour of explaining to my caption writers that they need to do their research. Seriously one more incorrect clothes credit and I will throw the sorry little brown-nosers out on the street. 

So how was everybody else's day, anyway? Remember darlings - arrogance will get you far, and don't be afraid to kick arse and take names if you're unhappy. There's always something you can do."

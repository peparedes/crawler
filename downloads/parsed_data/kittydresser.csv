I&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;STYLE<br /><br />.&nbsp; it makes me furious that noone will chat with me and then i think well maybe if i did something. like ran in races like i used to or take karate like i used to. or something besides lay in bed then i would have pictures to put up on facebook and people would&nbsp; notice me. and actually that makes sense.&nbsp; and it does makes sense, but the reality is i cant do those things and actually when i post things like im going on a ghosthunt NOBODY&nbsp;pays attention. BTW im going back to the hornet overnight in febuary. but nobody pays attention. so im going back to the beauty thing. when i was a nude model i had tons and i mean tons of pervs on my yahoo messenger all the time day or night. even though they were asking me to suck their dicks.. hey they were still talking to me and i didnt have to take overnight marriage propsals from iran! its all beauty, thats it, and chris this is a tough one if you agree with me its saying you think im ugly. now i could do that shit. i could grow my hair, die it blond, plaster on tons of makeup. and buy some whoreish looking clothes, but i still probably wouldnt be popular. maybe i would. well theres nothing i can do about it. im still gonna be getting marriage proposals from iran. and nothings gonna change. you know i mailed my own cousin a response to an e-mail before i knew about the results of my brain tumor and told her I&nbsp;MIGHT&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;A&nbsp;BRAIN&nbsp;TUMOR and its been about two weeks and no response. that just shows you my relatives. much less strangers. hmmm the k-2 meters are going nuts, but thats normal.. thats ghosthunting termonalogy dont you know.&nbsp; so that is my rant. if i were not a ganster homo and looked like hmmm, chris who do you like? miranda cosgrove.. and looked like miranda i would be popular. i maybe wouldnt even have to get naked. it just pisses me off so bad! i wanna be popular--WAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! and BOO&nbsp;HOO!!<br /><br />OMGGGGGG!!!! its three in the morning and i just talked to a guy that i used to chat with years ago, nice guy, but i happen to mention to him that the nude website that i was on southern charms was for ORDINARY&nbsp;WOMEN. so he agreed with me! now he thinks im ORDINARY! OMG that has just ruined my life. I&nbsp;think in black and white so i will always look in the mirror and say to myself im ordinary!! of course what he actually said was in the non-black and white thinking scope was that I wasnt was i was talking about above a media stereotyped woman with big tits and blond hair. so if i dont think of it in black and white he didnt really say i was ordinary, he said i wasnt what the media makes guys think are hot! i mean a bald head and 12 gauge piercings! i think thats anything but ordinary, and ive paid a lot of money and went through a lot of pain for those piercings and one thats still infected. GOD&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;IS&nbsp;A&nbsp;NIGHTMARE!! Am i ordinary, UGLY and unattractive, oram I&nbsp;unique? oh come on anna dont think in black and white. this really will ruin my life. and my night. oh i feel so bad!"

"event","&nbsp;so yes folks this is my wisdom tooth. and below it is a scene from the movie SAW 3D where the guy had to use pliers to yank out his teeth. anyway if anybody cares i mentioned in my last post that my tooth had broken off or a filing had fallen out when i was eating some cereal. and also i will find out if i have a brain tumor on Tuesday. yep. anyway, i must have some seriously big balls or ive grown a pair because whenever i go to the dentist and i think its just gonna be for a filing or a crown its always something much worse. in august it was a root canal. and on thursday it was a fucking extraction.&nbsp; Ive never had any teeth pulled in my life, i have all my wisdom teeth. well i am now&nbsp; missing one. the dentist said the tooth that broke was a wisdom tooth and there just werent many options short of pulling it out that he saw would work. he did suggest that since i have a huge anxiety about dentists that i be referred to an oral surgeon to put me to sleep. but i said with my huge balls no i just want to get it done. so it was a nightmare they tried to give me gas (which ive never had before) and i was terrified of it (the gas) because ive seen TV shows where people just go insane on the stuff. but they just said no the gas will help you relax, so they put it over my nose but it didnt do shit. they kept the gas on the entire time. and ive never known anyone in my life getting a tooth yanked out while they are wide awake. i mean he gave me a bunch of novicane and then he took out his pliers. seriously pliers. i thought it would just gush blood, i had no idea. so he losened the tooth with the pliers for about ten minutes. i mean he was pulling on that thing. i mean really pulling the tooth with the pliers. and finally it came out. he gave me the tooth which is disgusting. its got a massive cavity in it and caked on blood. it bled for about 2 hours afterwards probably. i used up about 6 or 7 gauzes. and its only been three days so it still hurts. luckily i have vicoden. i just keep picturing someone tying me up and pulling out my teeth with pliers without the novicane. so that was my tooth terror! has anybody else ever had their wisdom teeth out while being awake? yeah somebody could answer me<br /><lj-embed id=""127""/></lj-embed><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kittydresser/pic/000bcd64/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kittydresser/pic/000bcd64/s640x480"" /></a>"

Paul got me a laptop for christmas.. hey pretty cool. now im back on the net again. finding out i was never popular just like i knew anyway... and on new years.. just to top of everything,, because things have been pretty bad and pretty serious and in about three days im gonna get the results of the MRI i had last wednesday which costs 900 bucks on my credit card. so yeah im about to see if i am going to die a horribly painful death from a brain tumor just like my mom did. am i scared? hell yeah!&nbsp;i am terrified, but nobody cares. and a shout out to my WONDERFUL&nbsp;family... i might have cancer douchebags. but whaT I WAS SAYing is on new years to top everything off my god damn tooth fell out when i was eating some frosted mini-wheats.. actually it was a filling but it feels like my tooth. so that was just the last straw. probably have to have a crown,. more money. and i havent mentioned the other medical problem i have yet.<br /><br />oh did i mention chris is a fat ass... just wanted to make sure. so now im in a deep depression, my baby georgie who is 16 years old had all but three teeth pulled out because hes mouth was horribly infected. we had that done over the holidays. so i now have a toothless cat! great!bless his heart and that bill was 500 bucks. but paul paid for it. so if i dont have a brain tumor the next thing thats wrong with me is i have a large cyst under my chin. i had an ultrasound done on that not too long ago. the doctor read the ultrasound and said i need to go to a specialist to have a NEEDLE&nbsp;BIOPSY&nbsp;done of it!!! great.. more money.. and folks or the invisable fuck who reads this., i pay 1,000 dollars a month for insurance!!! and i cant use it when im in dire need because they could cancel me. this comes out of a disabled naked womans pocket. so anyway this cyst could be cancer also.. probabaly around 700&nbsp;bucks. now plus the new dental bill that will probably be over a thousand for a new crown.. so i have this biopsy to look forward to.. this has just been a banner few months for me. i mean it just keeps piling on and piling on. and i huge thing that had a lot of meaning to me happened on christmas eve. i was desperate for a church service to go to, so it just so happened that st. albans the little episcopal church down the street was having a service at 11pm. now we never go to church but we did on last easter and the minister just out of the blue singled me out and asked me if i would go have coffee with him??? wierd???? well i had a migrane headache on the day he was supposted to come over so it never worked out.. but then we were out for a walk and we ran into him on the street . he said the same thing, i want to meet with you. do you need prayer? i'll help you? you know like some divine intervention was going on... the fool knew me i mean i have three huge 12 gauge piercings in my face im hard to forget and im bald!&nbsp; but on christmas eve this same guy absoltuely DID&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;remember me at all. he just shook my hand and said merry chrismas just like he did with everyone else. I&nbsp;was SHOCKED. he asked me out for COFFEE. okay?? its like the devil is down on me. it really shook me up<br /><br />well anyway we have done NOTHING&nbsp;in the past months, no ghost hunting no anything, because ive been so sick. now i dont know what im gonna do since i have my own computer and im not popular on the web.. what do you do with that??? and the way i feel now chris carlson i hope the chair that your sitting in breaks, because your so fat. ha ha. oh and you can die. like i might... cause i might have inoperable brain cancer!!! yeah.. GO&nbsp;INOPERABLE&nbsp;BRAIN&nbsp;TUMOR!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; what do to? online i wish i didnt have my own computer geez. well all i can say is god please help with all thes medical things and chris i wouldnt hate you if you had kept your word. but you didnt, just like everybody else in my life. oh and you know in that little picture in the corner i was about 140 pounds.. now im about 95 pounds."

"event","<br /><span style=""color: #ff0000"">well i was gonna put a picture of me on here, but i realized no body gives a rats ass what i look like. i just downloaded a new version of yahoo messenger on pauls laptop. intending to go into the chat rooms just for something to do.im doing that now in fact and i realized that this is the definition of being lonley. i havent felt that &quot;memphis&quot; lonliness in over a year. because this is something i would do at home. and as physically sick as i am it breaks my heart to know im going back to this sometime. it hurts. its a feeling that cant be described. as sick as ive been ive been terrified of dying, but to think about chatting to losers in the middle of the night because no body cares about you makes me think of suicide and of drinking and of what its gonna be like when i get home. i feel so anxious and just stupid for having all the self esteem problems, like my face breaking out and the other unmentionable dematoligist problem. Lord have mercy i am so lonely and so afraid and i hate myself. i dont wanna watch home improvement and like i have for a year sit and wait for hours for my sleeping pills to work.&nbsp; i want reality which is to take the entire jar why does my family ignore me. i mailed both of my cousins mark and michael they never answered. i just dont get why nobody cares about me. you know i wanna shed this feeling, its toxic, awful. ive been taking to many sleeping pills so i can only take two tonight, im going crazy. as dumb as this sounds ive gotta brush my teeth. Cindy asked me in an e-mail recently,, what would be the first step in going about fixing my problem? i have no idea. okay the guy i wass talking to just got too perverted. i better just leave this and try to go on with the night. cigarrettees make me sick lately.&nbsp; how am i gonna make it in memphrika. how is my ugly dyke looking ass gonna make it in the most dangerous city in the united states alone and unable to function. and why DOESNT&nbsp;ANYBODY&nbsp;ON&nbsp;FACEBOOK&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;ME!!!!!!!! people are too involved in their own lives to see when someone needs a friend.&nbsp;. my family&nbsp;has ignored me for most of my life and now that we are connected by facebook they continue to do it. its a slap in the face. and it hurts. its like whats wrong with me? okay lord just make this feeling go away. </span><br />"

(there was bad things about others inserted here but i have to erase it) i feel terrible about not doing anything for moms anniversary. 9 years is a hell of a long time not to see your mother. its too hard to explain she doesnt seem like she was ever human now. i dont know. forget this..no body cares anyway.. sorry mom, i miss you like it was yesterday. im sick and i wish you would help me or come to me in a dream or some shit.. also bad stuff about people but had to erase it.. lame ass entry.."

"event","okay, fine this is just gonna be a jumbled mess. like first of all where are my firestarter youtube videos, i cant get into my youtube account and they arent on facebook anymore, which seems to be my only <span style=""color: #ff0000"">socialization at all, and man that is forever FUCKED&nbsp;UP.<br />&nbsp;<br />okay, i came here to write some shit. like you know the my dad is crazy junk... and im sinking in my depression so bad that im in the bed til 7:30 pm at night, my meds are terrible, even though ive achieved my goal of getting off cymbalta, in which i was supposted to receive a Tattoo FOR&nbsp;as a reward. its all the same, nothing different, in my mentally ill clothes, awake all night, asleep all day... terrified of when paul is gonna send me home. like its been bad the past few days, im trying to pull my ass together, but not doing well at it at all. its scary. <br /><br />well, you know titanic comes on TNT for two days this weekend, and im thinking of what killing myself would be like you k now with a bottle of lunesta when i get home. like are there horrible convulsions and seizures and just like idont know or do you just fall asleep.. curious... anyway, blah blah blah titanic the ship was one of the few things that my mom and i enjoyed... so thats why i used things from titanic for her funeral, yeah yeah.. <br /><br />and im about to turn 33... 33.. and theres something i think about turning this age.. something perhaps very egotistical. but jesus died at 33 and well never mind.&nbsp; 33, is ancient, <br /><br />so i was looking back at titanic while it was on and thinking, come on anna you can pull yourself out of this depression, you can do it.. blah blah whatever.. and thinking hey i was strong and i lived back when titanic was made in 1997 and the next year, i went and lost my mind and my&nbsp; mom got terminal cancer... so, its like if i give in to my depression to much then the 20 year old who went through so much alone and by herself back in the late 90's its like well by god she never existed nor did her pain ever exist... but i dont know its a lot easier to pull yourself up when your in a total crisis.. you know like you are losing your sanity and your mom is dying. now its just boring. its like well i had to get through that, i had no choice.&nbsp; but then i say, ive been on meds for over 10 years im tired, im old i can tfight the depression anymore, i wanna give up... theres two sides to it, of course. <br /><br />but anyway, seeing as noone ever reads this even though i know i am taking a chance because for some damn reason livejournal is hooked up to facebook... bad.. bad. thing.. but i gotta put it anyway, you know the only time anyone ever read my journal entries was when neely the abadoning cunt did.. she read my myspace entry.. now who would have thought and she just pulled her little friendship... oh my i was shocked to say the least. i mean we werent friends at all, i want and still want to cut her head off or do something more painful.. but once in a while you have to hope for karma... just a little little bit. so, the shit that im putting is...<br />&nbsp;<br />Yes, it is seVerely bothering me that all my estranged family members on my dads side, seem to have facebook pages now... im thinking.. what the hell is this.. damn i cant think of anything clever to say.. fuck.. well damn its just a dysfunctional estranged family reunion. its very infuriating.. you know my uncle henry has a page now. and im like okay is it just gonna be a big secret between the two of us that my dad was psychotic? like oh how cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /> these people have my lord its been years and years since ive seen or talked to any of these people.. its some of my cousins and my aunt meredith.. whos one godchild Jill is like a huge target of my estranged family wrath.. this cunt was dads godchild.. and she wants nothing to do with me for some reason... actually these people, okay theres about 5 or 6 of them now, still want nothing to do with me..... now why is that? AND&nbsp;NO&nbsp;I&nbsp;DONT&nbsp;WANNA&nbsp;HERE&nbsp;SOME&nbsp;SARCASTIC&nbsp;CRAP&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;ANYONE.. cause ya bet your ass you dont know the whole story. <br /><br />ugh, i feel i need my firestarter vids in this post.. just in case someone reads this and learns that im psychotic and i believe that im charlie and i can fry people. HA&nbsp;HA&nbsp;HA&nbsp;HA&nbsp;HA&nbsp;HA&nbsp;HAHAHA. and i need to shave and i just shaved yesterday. but anyway,<br />&nbsp;<br />it does hurt enough to be honest when your entire family is estranged and you dont know basically a single one of them, yet there they are in your face on facebook ha... ignoringyou, once again. i cant believe im able to hold my tongue about it... yeah just make sure i really hear voices that tell me to pyrokentically burn..... okay im not, if i was hearing voices that would probably be the least of my worries, but my daddy heard voices, you k now,,, just to let the rest of the family know.. he heard a LOT&nbsp;OF&nbsp;VOICES.. VOICES&nbsp;IN&nbsp;HIS&nbsp;HEAD&nbsp;THAT&nbsp;TOLD&nbsp;HIM&nbsp;TO&nbsp;DO&nbsp;THINGS.... HMMMMMMMMM..............okay what do i do now... just know that i have a big crush on TVS&nbsp;CRAIG&nbsp;FERGUSON.... And that I&nbsp;am CHARLIE&nbsp;McGEE.. thank you very much and have a pleasant fucking tomorrow.</span>"

"event","<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><em><font color=""#ff0000"">well, i finally got up out the bed long enough to review and spoil for u wonderful folks who dont read my journal, the haunting in conneticuit.... i cannot spell that state!&nbsp;fuck! Anyway, its a major deal if i go to a movie, like with all my paniac and sick problems.. so we went to a new theater out here called &quot;the rave&quot; oh how like so cool... Yeah? Anyway, the story starts or takes place in 1987 when a teenager named matt had severe cancer and his family needed a new place that was closer to the hospital so he could get his treatments. So, of course they find an old victorian house that just happened to be a funeral home in days past. They find tons of photos of victorian people pictured with there dead relatives....not such a shocker since most people didnt have a camera in those days and when a relative died that was likely the only photo they would have of them. It starts when matt, who is living down in the basement where the old funeral parlour was starts to see things. He figures they are a side effect of his cancer treatment, when of course they arent.. ohhhhhh...You will hear this poem in the movie mentioned ALL the time and i cant get the poem out of my head, it blows, but its an awesome poem,, a nonsense poem, not sure who it was written by<br /></font></em></span><strong><em>One fine day in the middle of the night&quot; (Journal Versions)</em></strong> <p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>One fine day in the middle of the night,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Two dead boys* got up to fight, [*or men]<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Back to back they faced each other,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Drew their swords and shot each other,<br /><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>One was blind and the other couldn't, see<br />&nbsp;</li><li>So they chose a dummy for a referee.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>A blind man went to see fair play,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>A dumb man went to shout &quot;hooray!&quot;<br /><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>A paralysed donkey passing by,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Kicked the blind man in the eye,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Knocked him through a nine inch wall,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Into a dry ditch and drowned them all,<br /><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>A deaf policeman heard the noise,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>And came to arrest the two dead boys,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>If you don't believe this story&rsquo;s true,<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Ask the blind man he saw it</li></ol><span style=""color: #ff0000"">Im not done yet, just tired...be back. okay im back.. anyway aside from the many dead people who pop out and scare the rest of the family which also scared some little annoying teenagers who were in the theater and they screamed and laughed at the top of their lungs every time which pissed me off, you kinda just have to get to the ending. Okay, apparently the mortician was doing some kind of experiment on his dead folk and he would carve them up with letters and then cut of their eyelids.. which the kids in the movie found and then they decided... hey lets do a little research on this house.. hmmm?? well, the main ghost that matt kept seeing was a boy named jonah.. thats where the top lines of that poem come in.. matt said its two dead boys ready for a fight. cause matt was dying.. U know. The crazy mortician was doing seanses... cant spell that either and his medium was a boy named jonah. apparently at one of these seanses, Jonah became so possessed that he let out ectoplasm through his mouth which burned and killed everyone at the seasance table. Okay tired again. Jonah was actually a good spirit who died tragecially at the end of the sesanse after everyone else. So, matt meets a priest at the hospital and tells him whats happening and the priest comes in and accidently removes jonahs bones and then the rest of the ghosts in the house go nuts. so, matt wakes up one night actually covered in bloody letters, so they take him to the hospital and hes really on deaths door, but somehow he knows that lining the walls of the basement are hundreds of bodies that the mortician stole from a graveyard in order to conduct his experiments, so he comes back to the house with an ax, finds all the corpses and then sets the house on fire with him still in it. so the fire releases all the bad spirits and when matt is finally dragged out of the house, while hes unconsicous he sees jonah like in heaven. Jonah was burned to death after the seasance, so he always apperared as this charred monster, he was burned to death in an oven--hmmm clique.. when the ghosts in the house went mad. so matt sees jonah whole again and they look at each other and all jonah wanted was his spirit to be released from the house, so matt did that with the fire, and in return, matt who was most certainly going to die from his cancer, is completly cured... apparently by jonah.. hmmm, i dont think this was a good review, i have no clue about the real story, but i bet most of it is crap.. it was a good movie though.. so yeah catch it.. and youll be singing that poem for the rest of the night. i swear..</span>"

I&nbsp;just am so tired and dont wanna get out of bed and the point of this trip is that paul is supposted to wait on me hand and foot while i detox from this crap, but it doesnt matter, i feel like death. im buying a&nbsp; new house soon, im getting out of my nigger neighborhood, things should be looking up, but something is just wrong."

Occasionally there will be black (melanistic)&nbsp;or white (snow) colorations. Due to their attenuated height and length, Savannahs will appear to be much heavier than they actually are. Most&nbsp;of Select Exotics F1 females, for instance, which range from 14 to 19 pounds, are estimated to weigh 25+ pounds when seen in person.</div><div>While the Savannah has existed since the mid-1990&rsquo;s, most still carry a high percentage of wild blood. Even so, you will find great variety in quality and&nbsp;appearance from breeder to breeder. As each year passes, it seems that more variation in quality is found, especially in the later generations. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>Based on the amount of wild blood, Savannahs are priced&nbsp;from $1,000&nbsp;to $16,000. &nbsp;Size and personality/temperament varies from generation to generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway they can&nbsp;weigh up to 30 pounds!! i&nbsp;mean my biggest cat right now, his name is Sucky..well his real name is Mackenzie... here is the little brat boy! well the big brat boy...<a href=""http://annajeanette.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8354f3a1a69e20111689a4f8a970c-pi"" style=""display: inline""><img class=""at-xid-6a00d8354f3a1a69e20111689a4f8a970c image-full "" title=""SUCKY)"" alt=""SUCKY)"" src=""http://annajeanette.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8354f3a1a69e20111689a4f8a970c-800wi"" border=""0"" style=""width: 62.49%; height: 286px"" /></a> <br />&nbsp;He weighs about 15 pounds and i have trouble picking him Up! wow! to pick up a 30 pound cat! how cool is that??

I am so overwelmed.</span></span></p><p><span style=""color: #33cccc""><span>I need your comfort, in the name of the father, son and holy spirit.. amen.. i love you lord, you are all i have.<br /><br />&nbsp;</span></span></p><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.amazingcounter.com""><img alt=""Free Counter"" border=""0"" src=""http://cb.amazingcounters.com/counter.php?i=2515210&amp;c=7545943"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.trudating.com/dating-services.html"">Looking to date</a></div><center><a title=""Christian Graphics!"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sparkletags.com/graphics/Christian""><img alt=""Christian"" border=""0"" src=""http://test.sparkletags.com/import/graphics/Christian/016.gif"" /></a><br /><a title=""Christian Graphics Click here!"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sparkletags.com/graphics/Christian"">Hot Comments!</a></center><img alt="""" border=""0"" style=""visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px"" src=""http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyMzQ5MDE2NDYyMDMmcHQ9MTIzNDkwMTY1NjYyNSZwPTExMDQ2MSZkPSZnPTEmdD*mbz*xOWM4YmY*N2FiYjE*NGY5YjlhMWViNzQyNmFiNWJjNA==.gif"" />"

"event","Lets see two examples of insensitivy, well one I got today, from the LOSER site Nolongerlonely.com. Its a place where people with mental illness's are supposted to get together and find friends. I never get any mail from them, but I today I got a note from a guy who decided to basically describe his boring hobby of going to garage sales and looking for antiques, the letter was all about himself, he didnt even ask, How was i doing today? <br /><br />So, i wrote back, im sorry but it usually helps if you want to get to know someone to mention your hobbies but to also ASK THE OTHER PERSON about their hobbies. Its not polite just to focus on yourself. Another example was on sex and the city the other night, it was when miranda first had her baby, and she was exhausted and haggered and needed help, however while she was trying to get ready for work, with her shirt basically on backwards and her hair in a mess, she was talking to carrie on the phone who was whining about her past relationship with Aidan and if she had (messed Aidan up) finally miranda screamed at her, Look, I HaVE A BABY, im fucking exhausted, I do not have time to listen to this trivial crap about guys that I used to listen to, and you should have some consideration for MY situation and get out of your own fucking world. <br /><br />Ive been through the threats of suidice, the attempted explanations of self abuse, and the warnings to my fellow sickos about certain medications, but finally I realize NO ONE IS INTERESTED. So, ive stopped that shit, you know forever left to try and make a joke to people online or to show that theirs nothing wrong in my world. I have always been oversensitive to the needs of my former friends... listening patiently while they pummle me with boyfriend problems, husband problems, kid problems as well as their own mental illnesses. When i started losing friends was when I finally said.. I cant take this anymore. i have feelings too, i just dont want to listen to yours... and with that one major friend ellen was gone. <br /><br />The minute that you show someone else besides a therapist your problems, thats when friendships go out the door. But what do you do? Im going through a lot, and you know if i wrote it in an email to someone and god forbid I failed to ask about the other persons feelings first, i would be shunned. I ALWAYS, ALWAYS ask about the other persons feelings FIRST....... So why then are people allowed or think that because of this they can just ignore my feelings? <br /><br />I have so much new shit, recently my dead uncle, sending his family flowers and getting no response, my fathers journals, extremely painful, almost too painful to read, the recent crime on my street, the shooting, addiction to cymbalta, and the physical pain and exhaustion that goes along with it. Knowing that I am now addicted to an antideppressant, the selling of the house, trying to get out of this neighborhood... but of course as always the lonliness,and the despair, <br /><br />you know when paul was here I saw my old friend alison jones at the movie theater, i hadnt seen her in a year, I made it a point to go up and hug her, and for years and years i have listened and listened to every trival thing that came out of that girls mouth.. and now it appears.. because i told her to call me and she hasnt, that im not even good enough for her. <br /><br />I dont think theres any way to deal with insensitivity at all, its very painful. If I had to say to myself, you know anna, you deserve this behavior because you dont ask others of their feelings, then others insensitvity would make more sense, but thats simply not the case. <br />So, in a simple question, I suppose i continue to ask others how they are, and they will continue to ignore my needs. Not much else to it, i guess.. so how do you deal with it... I guess you dont.. i guess you just stuff it inside. <br /><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php""><img alt=""http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php"" src=""http://www.freehitscountersnow.com/counter.php?id=23740&amp;t=6"" /></a><br /><span style=""font-size: 10px; font-family: arial""><a href=""http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php"">http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php</a></span></div>"

"event","<br /><em><span style=""color: #ff0000"">Im wanting to find some medievel paintings of heaven and hell to go with this, but im pretty drunk, which wears me out. I&nbsp;have dantes inferno up but probably wont do anything with it. Seems my uncle Buddy, my mothers oldest brother died this saturday at 73.<br /><br />This is the Rogers&nbsp;family who abandoned me and now its there turn to hurt. When Buddy saw my mother on Saturday i know her only question was, &quot;did you watch over my daughter&quot; How is my child? and Buddy can only answer honestly (its judgement time) Christ may not banish you, but my mother will. Sister and brother may have been reuintied in heaven, but as he faced her, he had to be honest. (there is no rescue this time) there is no hiding. <br /><br />I&nbsp;have no idea what types of conversations went on between them when mom was alive.. but i bet, she asked buddy to watch over me. Well, of course in reality he shunned me at moms funeral and I&nbsp;havent spoken to him in over 8 years, he was also the bastard who was going to sue me and my estate for the cost of mothers funeral. He will have to tell my mother what he did. As much as I hate my mother right now, because of the new revalations of my fathers journal, I&nbsp;know that I&nbsp;am and still am her only concern.&nbsp; When he told her he abandoned me and treated me worse than a pile of dog shit under someones shoes, it is she who judged him and she who is furious. <br /><br />When he came into heaven and saw his only sister, he HAD&nbsp;TO&nbsp;BE&nbsp;HONEST, no more games. He had to say, I&nbsp;NEVER&nbsp;EVEN&nbsp;SPOKE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;HER&nbsp;AT&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;FUNERAL, I&nbsp;TOOK&nbsp;THE&nbsp;RING&nbsp;THAT&nbsp;OFF&nbsp;SHE&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;ON&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;FINGER. I&nbsp;SPOKE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;HER&nbsp;THROUGH&nbsp;A&nbsp;MEDIATOR. I&nbsp;WOULD&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;SPEAK&nbsp;TO&nbsp;HER. Yes, shelby, she was a child, at 23, that is SO&nbsp;YOUNG, but I&nbsp;deserted her and my family deserted her, because she had a mental illness. <br /><br />SHelby, i thought she was selfish, but she only was VERY&nbsp;SICK. I&nbsp;pray that my mom was angry, i pray that she was furious. I&nbsp;pray that she rejected him at first.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was not notified by the Rogers family of this death, i was notified by my uncle Henry through another source. My uncle henry is on my fathers side. They did not even give me the courtsey of telling me my uncle had died.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&nbsp;am going to send flowers, because it is the right thing to do, but it also revenge. Just to let them all know that even though I&nbsp;wasnt even notified I&nbsp;still care. I&nbsp;dont know what to put on the card of course, because about a year ago i had written a letter in which to clarify things between buddy and me, but my accountant said DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;SEND&nbsp;IT, HE&nbsp;WILL&nbsp;SUE&nbsp;YOU. MY accountant said, I&nbsp;WiLL&nbsp;SENT&nbsp;IT&nbsp;IF&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;DIE. NOw, he has died and more unfinished business has taken place. THe funeral for my uncle is tomorrow. I&nbsp;do hope that there is MUCH&nbsp;PAIN, MUCH&nbsp;MUCH&nbsp;PAIN, THE&nbsp;SAME&nbsp;AS&nbsp;I&nbsp;FELT.&nbsp; But it doesnt really matter, because my uncle is in heaven with my mother and my mother is the judge.. <br /><br />Before my uncles grandchildren came, he wasnt such a bad guy, but when they came, No matter how much i was suffering, I was pushed aside.&nbsp; As I&nbsp;am also going through the pain of reading my fathers journals, it seems nothing can be right... but now it can be right,,,, I&nbsp;KNOW&nbsp;THAT&nbsp;THROUGH&nbsp;THE&nbsp;ABUSE&nbsp;I&nbsp;AM&nbsp;NOW&nbsp;READING&nbsp;ABOUT, THE&nbsp;TERRIBLE&nbsp;ABUSE&nbsp;I&nbsp;SUFFERED&nbsp;AS&nbsp;A&nbsp;TWO&nbsp;AND&nbsp;THREE&nbsp;YEAR&nbsp;OLD--like caylee Anthony. My mother is sad and she wanted her brother to Help me and he did not.&nbsp; Honestly, even though i have not spoken with him or ANY&nbsp;Of my mothers side of the family for 8 years.. I&nbsp;will still miss my uncle. HOnestly, I&nbsp;am jealous, and hurt because they are together and I&nbsp;am still here. Things i do not understand, I&nbsp;HATE&nbsp;CHILDREN, I&nbsp;MEAN&nbsp;HATE&nbsp;THEM. HATE&nbsp;THEM&nbsp;SO&nbsp;MUCH. But how could someone just reject caylee anthnoy and she died. The same has happened to me, as i deal with the revalation of serious child abuse, I&nbsp;turn to God and only to him. <br /><br />How could anyone in this world kill a kitten or hurt a kitten or hurt an animal... but i am better than an animal, I was a human child. My only prayer is that they suffer much, my uncles family, but as the lords prayer tells us.. Forgive us our tresspassers as we forgive those who trespass againist us.. I&nbsp;will send flowers, but do not know what to say yet. Paul says, I&nbsp;should not Let them off the hook so easily. He says I&nbsp;should at least mention that someone should have notified me of this death. I&nbsp;dont know. My mother and God are the judge. I&nbsp;hope my mother knows the things i have been through for her for the past eight years and that she keeps that in mind while she talks to her newly dead brother.&nbsp; <br />CHARLIE&nbsp;MCGEE&nbsp;FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I&nbsp;AM&nbsp;HER..

"event","<em><span style=""color: #ff0000"">well friday night it happened, gun shots on the street, actually rifle shots, at about 10 I was on the phone and I heard six loud loud pops and I hit the ground in the kitchen. i ran outside to see my neighbor directly across the street from me holding someone who was screaming and crying and shouting to all hell. I&nbsp;thought someone had been shot at first, my other neighbor geraldine was actually standing at her door too scared to come out of her house. it was chaos at first, people were screaming bloody murder and some nigger woman screamed, he did it, he muther fucking did&nbsp; it, and she picked up some rocks and threw them at the tow truck that was parked in the yard. Some other neighbors came out from down the street so i wasnt alone while they waited for the cops. When the cops got there, the guy who had shot off the rifle still had it, and the cops screamed, put the gun down now&nbsp;or i'll muther fucking kill you. Then once they had him arrested they went all over the car that I THINK he was aiming at and looked for bullet holes. Then geraldine called my&nbsp;name and i went in her house, and asked what was happening and i said, i didnt know. She said she had hit the floor also when the shots went off, I dont know what that nigger was actually aiming at, so a bullet could have flown through any of our windows. The way i feel tonight i wish one had flown through mine. anyway, i didnt go back to geraldines to find out what happened on saturday, i figured it was just be better not to know.&nbsp; <br /></span></em><br /><br /><span style=""color: #ff0000""><em><span>anyway on the subject of&nbsp; being alone, tonight theres a winter storm bullshit, They say.. gonna ice up the roads and crap. one of the black cat pack was hiding under my car about 7 shivering in the cold and looking through my door. all i can do is ask god to bless all the stray cats in the city, especially the &quot;black pack&quot; as i call them. help them find someplace warm.. and to the extreme i even asked a blessing for stray dogs tonight.... as much as I&nbsp;HATE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;DISPISE&nbsp;DOGS.. no animal should have to freeze to death. again, i take my sleeping pills very early and every night just pray for sleep,, i wonder who else is as lonely as i am, and i imagine the homeless, most of the homeless around here are dangerous beggers, but i know there are many mentally ill and even some children out there, so from one lonely place to another i ask for the &quot;good&quot; ones to be blessed. They are probably the only ones who feel as bad as I&nbsp;feel. my contiuned severe isolation and usual physical illness has promted me to come closer to this God i have never seen. I read in the bible tonight as i was just skimming through it, that in the gospels theres a verse which says, god has counted every hair on your head before you were born and he does not forget you and you are worth something to him.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cry a lot, especially at the verse, somehow, sometime im expecting jesus himself to swoop down and tell me that I am worth nothing, that my existance is only taking up space in his world and that my birth was an accident. I&nbsp;know i am worth nothing, this i truely believe and truely understand. i have known for most of my life that i am worth nothing. and that the severe isolation must be some punishment, some something that i have done or had done. as always i wonder how far it will go, will i in months forget how to talk altogether? what happens to people who are worthless in gods eyes. it hurts a lot to accept, but im learning to. just to sleep i fanatazie about finding some cold little abandoned bottle babies in my yard. they are so helpless, with their eyes not even opened. bring them in and go by some baby milk and some bottles and hear them cry and watch them sleep.. sigh..</span></em><br /></span><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php""><img alt=""http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php"" src=""http://www.freehitscountersnow.com/counter.php?id=23740&amp;t=6"" /></a><br /><span style=""font-size: 10px; font-family: arial""><a href=""http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php"">http://www.acaifamily.com/acai-extract-and-concentrate.php</a></span></div>"

My soul is admonished, it was an accident.. Just an accident.. not suicide.. Dying while im dirty and havent showered in like 5 days would kinda suck.. but bodies stink anyways. As dr. Hughes says, now that im adult i will never get the empathy and sympathy that i was denied as a child.. and now as a little child of serious abuse (as we are just learning) if my ass hole uncle would finish one of my dads last fucking journals. <br /><br />You know crime goes up every night, every night theres another murder, doesnt matter what part of memphis you live in.. the hood or germantown.. its everywhere and its terrifying. i live in the 2nd most violent city in the nation, and i saw on the news tonight a lady who had security doors and bars on her windows, just like i have.. she also had a security camera set up at one of her doors,,,, and we saw the nigger just pry open the security door and walk right in... that was uncool.. <br /><br />Two ways of dying here, accident or crime victim.. I am 100 percent ready to splatter the brains of any nigger who takes ONE STEP into my house.. but the worry is im so out on these sleeping pills that I wont hear him, until hes right over my bed and its too late. but that doesnt seem to have to be something a mentally ill suicidal chick should have to worry about, we should just worry about getting ourselves through the day without self injuing.. i burned myself with a cigarrette monday and the burn is terrible. it was all full of puss and it popped.&nbsp; So, i guess i have to go with dr. hughes... nobody cares and i cant make them.. I tried to get foster kittens and it didnt work. I prayed for them.... I TOOK ACTION.. as he says to do.. BUT IT DIDNT WORK.&nbsp; <br /><br />Only evil surrounds me and this house. Only evil tells me to cut and burn AGAIN and tells me theres no way out but death. there is no good surrounding me. whatever satanic ritual my dad performed in the back yard.. maybe really did let out something..&nbsp; As a child of God, when that child HELPS THEMSLEVES.. like it says in the bible..

I&nbsp;dont know how to get into LJ groups, I&nbsp;dont know how to put my entries into these groups, but its very aggravating. I&nbsp;am a nice person with a LOT&nbsp;OF&nbsp;FEELINGS, i appreciate others feelings... why cant people appreciate my feelings? do i need to put pornos of hot skanks sucking on dicks to get some attention? I&nbsp;mean what, nigger tell me? <br />Well anyway, today was one of the hardest days of my life, the eighth anniversary of My mothers death (which i know NO&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;CARES) but i spent today just like i spent it 8 years ago, listening to an ipod most of the day, instead of listening to a portable Cd player like i did back then. Every word of pain, came out of me as i sat here today, every word of truth,<br />sickness<br />dungeon<br />Jail<br />suicide<br />LET&nbsp;ME&nbsp;OUT<br />Alone<br />Lonely<br />Misery<br />Depression<br />forgotten<br />forsaken<br />Hell<br />Morgue<br />death<br />demons<br />CHRIST????<br /><br />Anyway, i couldnt get through today, but i just sat through it depressed, didnt drink, didnt smoke weed, didnt do anything, but sit in it and suffer, all I&nbsp;wanted was a hershey bar. thats all i wanted, I wanted it so bad.. but time went on and it got later and later, and i thought &quot;do i really wanna die over a hersey bar?&quot; My neighborhood is too dangerous to go get a hershey bar at 8 pm. too much risk. all i wanted on the day of my mothers passing was to sleep soundly and a hershy bar... Well, i didnt get either...I&nbsp;was just in the bed, ready to put this terrible day with its terrible memories behind me, when I&nbsp;heard, it was 10:30 pm... When I&nbsp;heard this LOUD&nbsp;BANGING&nbsp;AND&nbsp;BANGING&nbsp;AND&nbsp;SCREAMING&nbsp;ON&nbsp;MY&nbsp;DOOR, AND&nbsp;BANGING&nbsp;ON&nbsp;MY&nbsp;WINDOWS, AT&nbsp;10:30 pm... I&nbsp;grabbed the gun and went to the door. Now this had happened about 4 nights ago... The same black buck=toothed bitch had come to the door at 10 p.m. asking me where did someone live? i said &quot;i dont know&quot; she went away... But then the same bitch comes back, terrified me, with her banging and hollering for some bitch named maxine. Again, i looked out the window and this time firmly said.. WRONG&nbsp;HOUSE...... The bitch looked confused, and i was thinnking, now what is this? is this some kind of set up, are they targeting me, to see if only a white woman answers the door evertime.... but then i thought HELL&nbsp;NO... THAT&nbsp;BITCH&nbsp;WAS&nbsp;DRUGGED&nbsp;OUT, and fucking on coke or meth or whatever.. and thats why she got the wrong house Once again. So, i was praying tonight, like i usually do, saying god i dont know if i wanna be a christian anymore... i dont know, this has NEVER happened in the fucking 20 years ive lived here,,,,,, no coked out skanky bucked tooth hoe has woken me from an almost sound sleep banging like a muther fucker on my windows.... Thats scary as hell... <br /><br />There better not be a next time. This is insane, you know, im devestated that today is mothers anniversary, im just trying to get this day over with, all i want is a hershey bar... but its too dangerous for me to even have a hershey bar... and then the coked out hoe, having the nerve to bang on my windows twice.&nbsp; yeah, im on alert.. for real.. its insane. battle depression, battle everyday... do the right thing.. dont drink, dont smoke pot.. just ride it out.. just sit in the pain.. and now, you know i gotta make sure i watch my back, cause this coked out hoe could very well do something to my car.. and yes im afraid of anyone who dares bang on my windows twice that late at night... its just a battle of depression and a battle of terror... its never-ending. oh im scared as hell, scared as hell... but i feel im ready without a doubt to shoot someone. and it might be that coked out hoe.. cause you never know.. what someone on drugs is gonna do.. <br /><br />I&nbsp;miss my mom and it hurst so bad.. but she never went through this, this crime, this watching your back.. constantly.. it drives you further and further down.. its fucking hard.. all i can do about this crack hoe is call the watchdog of the neighborhood linda and see if she knows who the hell she is, and if i should be worried.. but next time im calling the cops... crazy shit, just crazy, crazy shit...</span></span>"

God will be will be with both of us. i hope. i just drank one shot and before that i felt physically terrible, i have so much to do tomorrow, will i get it all done? i have my usual terrors about a trip. all i can say to that is, God, please be in control. im tempted to drink more, god, georgie. well, thats my immediate problem, but underneath i got a note from henry, i guess somewhat of my hope worked out because journal 12 seems to be full of horrors. henry is like 60 and he is having nightmares about what he is reading, he is seeing who his brother really was, and SLAM to me, i am learning in this last journal some of what i wanted to know. henry said what he is reading seems like a horror movie that never ends, except he knows the characters. kinda ruining my halloween. i dont have the journal but henrys summary is not good, he said, violence, lots of violence, lots of demonology, exorcisms, who knows, maybe forced.. I dont know right now what happened to me at 3 years old, this is what we are just finding out, but from what henry has read, i can see myself at 3 hidden in my closet while vile screaming and utter chaois revolve around me. theres no way to explain the demonology that went on, because its just so insane no one would understand. its basically things out of the mind of someone who has completely lost their mind.. and at 32 just finding this out about your dead parents takes it toll. Apparently whats in this journal is very very serious and was severe child abuse. it wasnt sexual, it might have been physical i dont know yet, but a 3 year old child who might have witnessed even once her mother being beaten because her father thought she was possessed by a demon is some heavy shit. I cant imagine this, what i may have witnessed and cant remember, hiding in the shadows screaming for no one who would come.. but screaming to parents who were outside having an exorcism ritual for comfort. i guess as a little one i had my own &quot;hell house&quot; how could they do that do a baby? and i dont even know how bad it is yet, i dont have the journal. henry said from what hes read the violence and the arguing were getting worse and worse. Where was I? i was an only child, god what horrors did this child witness? what horrors did this child internalize?</span> <br /><br /><a rel=""ac7d93ede37ad814fc3bdfe70e3f69b6c2041e8b"" href=""http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/virgin30/"">Undergoing MyBlogLog Verification</a> <br />"

I wonder how long it would take georgie to crash without his insulin once i shot myself. if i ever planned it out, i would have to take him to the vet first to board him and then never pick him up. but, impulsivity is the only way, im so impulsive. it couldnt be planned. i wish it could. ive reached my limit on everything, my choices are to give my life up to my despair (which is what ive been doing) or to have an impulse and stick the gun in my mouth and forget its loaded and accidently fire. Thats possible, the problem once again, i dont know what it would be like, death, i think of it all the time, I&nbsp;wonder if, i mean how when your alive to you try to grasp what dying will be like, i cant. i have no clue. on the one hand I&nbsp;know the reality of my life and what god apparently wants, its the life of a physically sick, severely depressed, severely lonely, shut-in. a life that at 32, i have come to understand that no matter how hard i pray for help (as the people on mychurch) a website say i should PRAY&nbsp;MORE) in ten years i will be 42.&nbsp; God, has decided that i am to be alone and lose my mind... so with that in mind, i try hard to figure what death will be like.. I only have one person on the earth who i will miss. i will miss him a lot. i imagine as i die and start to leave myself i will realize that I might not see him again and i will be very sad. i have to wonder, do we feel and see our bodies laying there as has been described in so many near-death experiences, and until we get to Jesus we may even see the reaction of the one person that i will miss when he finds out im gone and that will hurt, will i see my funeral, will i be flying around trying to tell the few people that show up that im still there? or do we just skip all that? go straight to jesus and to our judgement? There are so many questions. HOw long are we tied with earth before jesus says, its time to leave earth now, forever. will that be terribly painful? or will we not care.&nbsp; if the trigger is pulled in my case on impulse, before i have time to ask forgiveness for killing myself will i even see jesus? What is the seperation of body and soul like? thats a scary scary one. that one keeps me up when im thinking about death. will it be like going anesthia, just going under and never coming up? will it be terrifying? how will it feel? does it hurt? Is it immediate? like in the case of a quick gunshot wound, will my body just fall over and immediately my soul will seperate from it? Will, i suddenly grasp what i have done and be filled with terror?&nbsp; and cry and scream (as a spirit) for my body that is no longer? if only there was a way for these questions to be answered. If only i didnt have to think about these questions. The thing that is REALLY&nbsp;REALLY&nbsp;REALLY&nbsp;bothering me now at this time are my dads (precious) journals. The journals that ive been waiting YEARS&nbsp;and YEARS for.&nbsp; My uncle is almost to the end of all the journals and they we a completle and utter sadness and disappointment. I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;would have the answers finally to why our family was the way it was, but the journals have only left me with more questions and not enough info for a book. So, for YEARS&nbsp;AND&nbsp;YEARS, i thought it was my purpse to write this book for my dad and for myself and for other mentally ill families, so when I&nbsp;would overdose on robitussion and feel what was really going on (severe antihistamine poisoning) and I&nbsp;did it again and again and almost everytime I&nbsp;had such a reaction and was so sick that I was positive I would have to be rushed to the e/r, that i was positive i was feeling what dying felt like.. that i was dying.. I remember i would sit down and i would pray and i would beg God NOT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;KILL&nbsp;ME, because my purpose had not yet been fulfilled, and that purpose was to write (this book) that now cannot be written. and the same would go when i overdosed on anything else, this was my argument.... But, the problem is Jesus knew all the time what I&nbsp;didnt know, he knew what i just found out, that writing that book IS&nbsp;NOT MY&nbsp;PURPOSE, yet he carried me through each terrifying night of poisoing and i never had to go the E/R.&nbsp; I&nbsp;dont understand, if Jesus knows that my purpse is to live (no to exist)&nbsp;in this way, and he knew I did not have a purpose... WHY&nbsp;DID&nbsp;HE&nbsp;SAVE&nbsp;ME? Its hard to describe what i feel about this, confused, sad, let down in a way. but very confused. There were times when he could have just Let me go, so many times, it would have saved me the life (the existance that I&nbsp;have now)&nbsp;and the death would have been accidental, not a suicide, i wouldve gone to heaven, but instead now with no purpose, sick physically constantly, living in my house as it was a prison, honestly im angry. im angry that he did not take me then. </span>"

"event","&nbsp;Dearest Sydney,

im gonna write you a little something now, because technically even though its 1am, one year ago at this time I had just gotten home from giving your spirit to God, Its funny, i am drinking tonight, but right at this time, I was so drunk, i barely remember anything. I know that even though chris was here a year ago, I was hysterical and I was reading the funeral rites from the book of common prayer, screaming them, trying to make a funeral (of sorts) for your body. I read about the blessing of the animals and remembered that when I was little we brought one of our cats to Grace st. lukes to have it blessed. I read all the funeral rites, there are several, rite one, rite two, dont know why and i put your name. There was more sorrow than i could imagine this night one year ago.&nbsp; I remember being so drunk out of my mind that i was screaming bible verses and prayers the entire night. Ive had my heart ripped out lots of times, but your death seemed all that i could bare. What i worry about a year later is that your animal spirit is angry with me, for a decision that i really had no choice but to make. Im worried that you are angry that i didnt stay with you, when they put you down, but i couldnt handle the idea of your body going limp in my arms, so i had to leave. Throughout this HORRIBE HORRIBE year, Ive repeated the words that i told you in my head probably thousands of times. Whats so fucked up is, I got most of the words from an episdoe of punky brewster, She was gonna lose her dog, brandon, and she told him some of the things that I told you, but of course brandon miracoulously recovered. I want you to be one of the first spirits that i see when I finally get the relief of death. I know i wanted to die a year ago, but i really wanna die this year. I guess its okay to tell you that im getting older, 32, and things look as if they really will never change. Georgie is still alive, but he will be 14 next month and im terrified of losing him, I want you to keep your eyes open Sydney because you never know. I am bracing myself for more pain. Anyway, your urn is really lovely, and theres a table where i have your urn and some pictures of both&nbsp; you and Noah, because Noah died really alone, without anyone. I hope you guys recogize each other and have been reiuninted.&nbsp; Theres some stuffed animals, and an old picture, asking God for protection of the house. Dixie funeral home sent a card, which i guess they do with everyone, but i still have that, even after a year.&nbsp; In a sense im jealous that you and mom were reuineted, because it was GREAT when you bit the crap out of her&nbsp; whilce she was on the toilet, It was one of those funny things that will go down in history. The thing is you were my cat and i'll never forget and i never do how fiercly protective you were of me, and that made me feel very special, because you seemed like the only one who was watching.&nbsp; Its not just how fiercly protective of the house that you were, but the night at pauls when i had taken too much cough syrup and i was sure i was going to die, I know you were tired and you didnt do too much, but you seemed to know that something was really wrong, and that paul didnt care, I opened my eyes and i saw you staring at me in the dark, I stared back at you, but you didnt move, you stood straight and still for a long time, and you didnt leave until you thought i was okay."

"event","<strong><em><font color=""#ff0000"">&nbsp;i dont know how right dr. hughes (my new therapist) is about the fact that im not ready or not stable enough to really let paul out of my life,&nbsp; its been exactly a year since he dumped me, what were six cats, and my car back into this hell hole.&nbsp; Then Sydney died, she died almost a year ago. she died on august 11, 2007. <br /><br />&nbsp; Dr. Hughes is tryin to get me all the way out to HOpe presbytrian church this tuesday for a bridges meeting.&nbsp; I cant see it happening. i barely moved off the couch this weekend and its been like that for over a month. Im in something that i havent been in in a long time, im in a deep deep depression. I am struggling, clawing just to do anything. My heart is broke, my birthday is in nine days, and im spending it totally alone. with noone. noone.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got really drunk last night and i threw up all over the place,&nbsp; <br /><br />Levitch has given me prozac but its making me eat, and i have to stop it,&nbsp; this isnt about dying, but how in gods name do i fight this. Someone who was weaker would give up, i cant give up, i think of what could happen if i give up, i pray for strength and hope, but the days dont get any better. like the aspca could come in and take&nbsp; the cats from me, like i could have to be hospilazized, who would take care of them. who would take care of georgie. im not fulfilling my responsiblites to georgie.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />i havent brushed my teeth in three days,&nbsp; whats causing this, total hopelessness, total loneliness, and terror to try and change without my only support.&nbsp; also, my birthday, birthdays only come once a year, they are supposted to be the one day, when you dont have to lay in bed, when someone besides your car i nsurance company sends&nbsp; you a card.&nbsp; <br /><br />When after your birthday passes and your alone and then well the 23rd is my b-day and then 19 days later sydney died. she died, its been a year, and she died, she died, u know i wanna go back to the pet death s upport group and cry like im crying now and say help me.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />paul has been who he has always been, the same man who dumped me off a year ago and then let sydney pass away, because of the trip, the trip killed her, he was so selfish that he HAD to get rid of me, that he killed my cat. he killed her, and i didnt stay with her. god, that pain is like unreal.&nbsp; unreal.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />He told my ex-roomate that he never wanted to see me again last year, and i know she wasnt lying, even though she has a reputation for it.&nbsp; Change, the most terrifying thing in the world when your so depressed all you wanna do is sleep. and cry.&nbsp; ive always had someone to call, see, theyve either been in canada or been 2000 miles away. but somehow if god has any grace and i can slowly pull out of this hole, and i know its gonna take a lot of time, if i even pull out of it, like if i change, the way im supposted to change, i wont have anyone to call.&nbsp;&nbsp; im understaning that no matter how much i beg or plead or tell paul im in a desperate situation, it has done no good in over a year, and in that case, it means it will never do any good. having to realize what dr. hughes says are expections that are never gonna get met, ever. is rippin me apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />like im sick of flying out there, i have expectiaons and hopes and when they dont come true, im thrown back into a pit of despair.&nbsp; who is this person anyway, hes a nothing, just like me, but maybe even more of a nothing than i am,&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />tonight like around midnight, i had just gotten up from sleeping all day, i always say, im depressed, this is serious, and his answer is basically, ""what the fuck do you want me to do about it""&nbsp; I said nothing, dont do anything, now im crying//&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened. i miss my mom, but what happened to make me exactly like her. she never let go of her man, even though it damaged her child for the rest of MY LIFE. and i cant let go of paul, though i know he can do nothing for me, and he wont and refuses to try anymore.&nbsp; sometimes, he would read me stories on the phone when i was really bad, once in a while read outta the bible, but now,&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 days before my birthday and 19 days before the anniversary of sydneys death, he says i can do nothing for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />my few hopes that can sometimes get me off the sofa, sometimes are listening to twila paris, god is in control and trying hard to bellieve it, even though i know, i cant believe it. god im in so much pain, its like incredible. its the way things used to be. its unbearable. i have the john denver wildlife concert, its not mine but netflix, i can keep it for a while i guess, it makes me smile a little bit to see him on Tv and little and sing along to his music, and try to hope that he is my guardian angel and he sees this, because he knows in heaven that hes the o nly one who can pull me out of this hole, even for a little bit. a tiny bit, a small second.</font></em></strong>&nbsp;"

It does'nt have a lock on it and its not very pretty, in fact its gray. However, I put my own decorations on the front, drawings that I &nbsp;colored all by myself with a magic marker. &nbsp;Most of the time, I stay in my room and study all the things that I have inside when my parents fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;They fight on the phone a lot, so I usually like to stay out of it, however sometimes (and my momma doesnt know this) I come out of my room and I hide behind the counter where she can't see me.&nbsp;While shes talking to my dad or to her friends about really serious things, I take notes on a little sheet of paper. &nbsp;I listen closely and I write down the things that seem the most important.&nbsp; Sometimes momma says that she does'nt wanna live anymore, most of the time she is crying. There are other times when she says that ""she's losing control"" and im not exactly sure what that means, but I know it must be real bad.&nbsp; It hurts the most when she says that she doesnt think she can handle taking care of me by herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I have to know these things because at ten-years old&nbsp;i am grown up enough to protect and take care of&nbsp; my momma,&nbsp;I mean&nbsp;its my job as a little girl,&nbsp;after all.</font> Later, I go back to my room and put my new notes in my secret box, I always make sure that its hidden away real good.&nbsp;<font color=""#ff0000""><br /><br />Today, a man is coming over to paint the outside of the house, so its kinda a mess out there. Momma was on the phone again today, though.&nbsp; She was fighting with my dad again. &nbsp;I know that they say all kinds of words to each other that I shouldnt hear, cuss words, lots of them.&nbsp; I wonder what they are fighting about? Its probably about me or maybe its not, either way its scary.<br /><br />I know my dad is the bad guy though, because that's what momma says, and I believe anything that she says. I get tired of the screaming&nbsp;anyway so I decide to go outside and watch the men paint the house, I don't talk to them because&nbsp;im kinda shy,&nbsp;I just watch and they dont mind. Maybe they like kids? A little while later I notice my dad's dark colored car pull into our driveway, I had no idea he was coming over today, I wonder if he wants to see me, probably not.&nbsp;<br /><br />When my momma comes outside to meet him, I decide to go back into the house and hide, I don't want any part of this. I feel really sad that I went inside though, really sad. My dad is gone all of a sudden, he left really really quick. ""Oh my gosh, whats going on now,"" I wonder.&nbsp;<br /><br />Something bad happened while I was inside, something really bad. I know because my momma is screaming and crying and I dont know what to do. She didn't tell me what happened, she got on the phone again instead. The men have stopped painting outside.&nbsp; She wants to call the police, she said the painter's saw everything but they werent sure&nbsp;if they should get involved.&nbsp;I know that they were&nbsp;yelling bad, bad words at each other, they were really&nbsp;loud. My dad lost his temper, he doesnt like being&nbsp;disrepected, not even by me. I guess Dad had had enough because he grabbed her, he grabbed her by both wrists, then he slammed her against the bricks, I think her head might have even been bleeding. She couldnt get free, he wouldnt let her go, he slammed her around a lot. Then he grabbed her by the throat, really hard almost so she couldnt breath, he tried to choke her so she would die, then he drove away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />When I found out,&nbsp;i ran inside the house as fast as my legs could take me, I needed my secret box, right now! &nbsp;I needed what was inside and quick!&nbsp; I fiddled with the top, I had trouble getting it open because I was shaking and my hands were all sweaty. Since, &nbsp;Im not allowed to have a real knife, I decided to make my own a little while ago. I made it out of two&nbsp; p<font color=""#000000"">opsicle </font>sticks and with the sharpest rock that I could find glued right on the end. my dad hurt my mom, he really hurt her.&nbsp;<br /><br />I run back outside, out of breath and holding the ""knife"" as tight as I can. I hide around the back of the house, just in case my dad decides to come back. I look up at my swing-set for a moment, seems like a dumb thing for a strong ten-year-old like me to have. Momma doesnt need to call the cops, because as long as have my ""knife"" I can handle it myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma doesnt know that i'll protect her (even if my dad wants to kill me too)&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold the ""knife"" in my hands and I make a promise to myself.&nbsp; I promise that if my dad ever hits my mom again I'll kill him, thats what i'll do. I'll kill him. I'll stab him right through his heart and i'll make blood run all over the ground. I wont even care. &nbsp;I'll be glad if hes dead, &nbsp; I'll stab him because I can do it, because im a&nbsp;big kid.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dad never came back, I guess that was good for him, because of my plan. Momma doesnt even know about the notes or my ""knife"" thats why my ugly gray box is my little secret, and Ive never needed it anymore than I did today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Later, after the day is finally over&nbsp;and im in bed, &nbsp;I wish someone would protect me too. &nbsp;I keep thinking over and over what if my dad comes back and hits me or kidnaps me or something horrible! &nbsp;I&nbsp;just cant protect everybody. See, most of the time, no one protects kids during a divorce, we have to protect ourselves and our parents too.&nbsp;<br /><br />All i can do is lay down all by myself and worry and leave my mom on the phone. Will she get the cops to come and arrest my dad? What will happen? I guess as long as i have my secret box, i'll be okay.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><font size=""4"">A severe divorce is a bitch, espeically when your in the middle like a fucking chess pawn and i cant confront my parents cause their dead, there are MANY MORE INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS LITTLE, MANY MANY MANY MANY MORE...&nbsp; WHATEVER..&nbsp; THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE SONG..<br />HELL IS FOR CHILDREN BY PAT BENATAR, all i can tell you, i know noone will believe me, but emotional abuse day after day after day, custody battles constantly, screaming, fighting, cussing.. It may not be physical abuse but its a kid. And there were isolated incidents of physical abuse, i was deathly afraid of my dad as a child. Extremely afraid, he did the same to&nbsp; me when i was 13, that he did to my mom in this story, the exact same thing, he smashed me against a wall, held me there, then he put his hands around my neck... yeah it was real cool... He basically said, if i disrespected him again or he felt disrespect.. I better watch my ass. And my mom called chidrens services on my dad. yep. i was the victim, but it didnt go like that. He would knock my door down when i was at his apartment, pound on it, screaming, that i was to leave it open.. or fucking else.. WHATEVER!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /></font><lj-embed id=""103""/>&nbsp; <lj-embed id=""104""/><br /><a href=""http://www.metrolyrics.com/pat-benatar-lyrics.html"">Pat Benatar Lyrics</a><br /><a href=""http://www.metrolyrics.com/"">Hell Is For Children Lyrics</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />by the way for anyone who has a fucking problem about me writing stuff about my childhood, check yourself first, are you now going through a divorce and child was my age, is my age now, think of what they are gonna through, if they were going through, the screaming, the custody, the fights all the time, would you tell them they were whining?"

Sadly, circumstances created a less than ideal living area for me. I am a single white (mentally disabled) woman, who has to reside here in an entirely african-amercian neighborhood in Memphis (a city which does have one of the highest crime rates in the nation, and is known for being extremely dangerous) However, this does not excuse the fact that I was assaulted a week ago today in a Walgreens parking lot (which is less than a mile from my house) </font></span></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">Ladies! No matter how much you think ""It cant happen to me"" Let me let you know that IT CAN!</font></span></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">My assault has (unfortuantely) two parts to it, the specific reason that I was targeted was because the person who assaulted me thought that I was a (gay, transgenger) or something white male, when of course I am COMPETLEY AND TOTALLY A HETOROSEXUAL WOMAN!&nbsp; However, from the back, it is difficult to tell, because I do have short hair (however I feel that as a human being I have the right to have short hair) and not be threatened with my life. </font></span></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">Anyway, to go on with what happened, last Wednesday a little before dusk, I drove down to Walgreens just to purchase a pack of cigarrettes. I was only in the store perhaps five minutes, however when I was walking to my car, I heard shouting coming from a grayish SUV which was parked a few feet away from me. The shouting was coming from a young african american male who was in the back seat. There was also an african american female in the front seat of the car. </font></span></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">The male was screaming at me (he wanted to know) (What the hell I was) Through other obscenties, he yelled, (are you a cunt, fag,--what)? He also mentioned that he had been ""watching me"" I was shocked, I had never seen these people in my entire life! I had no idea who they were, so I answered back, (look i dont know you people, just mind your business and go on) Well, this wasnt enough for the assaulant. So finally as he was still screaming at me, I had to say Look Just Fuck off)</font></span></strong></em></p><p><font color=""#0000ff""><em><strong><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">Well, that was my final word, (people who have been treatened with assault or crime always say How fast it happened) and that is so true.. It all happened in what seemed like a split second. Suddenly the screaming, very irrational african american male sprinted from the backseat of his car over to my vechile. He first stopped on the sidewalk in front of me, ranting and yelling that (HE HAD A GUN ON HIM AND THAT HE WAS GONNA POP A CAP IN ME NOW) If I Drove away. I said nothing, but I only had a second to get into my car and lock the doors before he was on the passenger side of my car, he started pulling on the door handle TRYING TO GET IN, so he then rammed on my window and threatened my life again. (Screaming once again that he had a gun and that he would shot me at Point blank range through my window if I did not roll it down)</font></span></strong></em> </font></p><p><strong><em><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">I did what he said, as he screamed more obsentities at me, demanding that I answer him as to (who I was) making it clear to me, that i would not get away if i did not answer.&nbsp; So, I remembered as quickly as a could the things that I have seen on crime prevention shows or shows about how to handle an irrational assaulant. I knew i had to try and calm him down, if i wanted my life, or else the situation would have esculated. (and yes by Gods Grace I was able to keep my head about me) so I calmly said, (Look, I really apologize (even though i had done nothing) Im a white woman okay, now, please you really need to chill, i am sorry if you felt disrespect, but U know it isnt worth killing me, Im not gay. just please calm down...</font></span></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">The crummy thing is that the other person who was in the same vechile, the african american female did nothing, I assume that she was probably laughing the entire time..

(Hurry the hell up and get your nasty cunt ass out of here and if I EVER SEE YOU at this store Again, I WILL KILL YOU)&nbsp; Only then did the other occupant of the vechile step out and pull the male away.. just casually telling him to (come on) as if nothing had ever taken place. </font></span></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">As, i drove away, I could still hear endless obsentities coming from his mouth and i am sure i could see a bit of a smirky grin on the female occupants face.</font></span></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><span style=""COLOR: #3399ff""><font color=""#0000ff"">So, as you might imagine I was pretty shaken up, I decided to go ahead and call the police (only thinking that I might be able to save someone else from going through the same thing) I didnt think the police would take it seriously.. however to my surprise.. they took it very seriously.

"event","<strong><em><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""3"">Today, Memphis is the largest city in the state of Tennessee, it has a vibrant culturally diverse population of 670,902. The city sits high atop the Chickasaw Bluffs which overlooks the deep brown of the mighty Mississippi River. This area is also called the Mid-South because it includes the agacent counties of the state of Arkansas as well as the state of Mississippi, this gives a total population of 1,260, 581. <br /><br />The ultra modern Memphis skyline includes the silver pyramid arena along with beautiful archetectual buildings as well as the famous Hernado De Soto Bridge which links Tennessee to Arkansas. Memphis also has a rich musical heritage, most have heard of Graceland (the home of Elvis Presley) as well as Sun Studios. Beale Street which is a part of historic downtown is considered by many to be the (home of the blues) where such famous blues musicians as W.C Handy and B.B. King would play well into the humid nights. <br /><br />Obviously, there are many important positive historical events which have helped shaped Memphis in the 300 years that Tennessee has been a state. However there is a much darker side of our history that also played a huge role in what Memphis is today in 2008, a much darker tiny thing which was not even visable to the human eye, and that tiny thing was the mosquito. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The city of Memphis was incorparted in the year 1826, Memphis did rather well for a southern city during the civil war and was considered in 1865 to be one of the the few emerging modern places on the Mississippi river. The cities population doubled during the civil war years to 48,000, that is how things were by the time, the Yellow Jack epidemic hit In 1878. <br /><br />Even though Memphis was considered (Modern) for its time period, our city had a MAJOR problem and that was poor sanitation. There were no toilets, onlly open sewers, garbage was thrown onto the streets and raw sewage was dumped into what is now a tributary of the Wolf River. Corrupt politicans who were bringing in such conviences as the telephone, telegraph and newspapers, seemed for some reason to neglect sanatiation. The riverfront was crowded by a stank pit of housing developments for the poor, most of the rich had already moved onto the bluff or across the river into west Memphis. The poor, along with all the open sewers had to deal with dead animals along with a mess of garbage which was dumped daily into the old gayoso tributary <br /><br />Even the rich, dealt with the annoyance of no paved roads, our sidewalks consisted of mud mixed with horse manure and rotting wood. One visitor to Memphis during that time period was quoted as saying, ""Ive been to Cairo and theirs dirt for you, Ive been to Colonge in Europe--where it is pure smell-but that all back down before Memphis"" In short MEMPHIS STANK! Most of the poor where the worst affected by other diseases such as cholera and smallpox before the great 1878 outbreak.. Prostitutes and river boat men kept their distance from the rich.. and likewise the other way around. <br /><br />The corruption, the unsanitary mess, along with standing water as well as men infected with Yellow Fever who traveled up the river to Memphis began one of the greatest tragedies in our entire history. It didnt take long for the paniac to begin.. Memphis had been through other outbreaks of yellow jack before so they knew what was coming.. but the LONG hot summer of July 1878 only made things much much worse.. In august, the first death from the dreaded Yellow fever was documented. <br /><br />Rich or poor no one was immune.. In the coming weeks 25, 000 more than half of the population desperatly tried to flee to the cooler areas up North, Doctors were at a loss.. They had no idea how the disease spread so quickly or how it spread at all.. Most of the talk of the day was that even touching a person who had died of yellow jack would give you the sickness. So, all kinds of things were burned, bonfires and cannons would permiate the night air.. Doctors thought that the sickness came from some kind of Spores in the air.. the bedlinens of the dead and dying were burned. <br /><br />The symptoms of Yellow Fever came on without warning, often affecting entire families.. sometimes leaving only one child barely alive as she sat in a house with her entire family dead. The incubation period after a bite from a mosquito was only a few hours to a few days. For example if a father began to develop minor symtoms such as pain, chills, and nausea, the rest of the family usually knew what that meant. In a few days, he would began to spike a high high fever and then the tailtale sign.. What gives yellow jack and yellow fever its characteristic name.. Jaundice.. as the liver began to fail the paitents skin would start to turn a distinct yellow color, even the whites of the eyes... <br /><br />By then it was much too late.. Mothers and children could only wait and watch as their father began an agonising decent into hell.. MOst of the mothers knew that they were next.. As the fever progressed, the fathers internal organs would began to bleed from the inside.. He would then be so sweaty and delirious that he didnt even realize that he was wretching up some of the most vile substances in most all illness.. It was called (black vomit) or by the spanish (vomito negro) It was a mixture of stomach bile, mucus from the bleeding organs and infected digestive juices, entire families were found covered in their own (vomito negro) writhing in agony as the final decent into death... Bleeding from every orafous of the body, even the victims eyeballs. Children could only watch as one by one their parents died.. and one by one they got sick also, often left to nurse themselves.</font></em></strong> <br /><br /><br /><!-- hitcountersonline.com Code START --><a title=""http://kittydresser.livejournal.com/ Stats"" style=""FONT-SIZE: 10px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; TEXT-DECORATION: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hitcountersonline.com/details.php?page=421183&amp;print_page=http://kittydresser.livejournal.com/"">Counter Stats</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.burleighaccommodation.com.au/""><img alt=""burleigh accommodation"" border=""0"" src=""http://www.hitcountersonline.com/count.php?page=421183&amp;style=0505059&amp;nbdigits=5&amp;reloads=1"" /></a><br /><a title=""burleigh accommodation"" style=""FONT-SIZE: 10px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; TEXT-DECORATION: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.burleighaccommodation.com.au/"">burleigh accommodation</a><font style=""FONT-SIZE: 10px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; TEXT-DECORATION: none""> Counter</font><!-- hitcountersonline.com -->&nbsp;<br />"

That just defys all logic to me..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children.. little children.. 3, 4 and 5 years old..&nbsp; they could never tell you that they (hate themselves)&nbsp;&nbsp; so i think we are all born with a pure soul... and MY GOD I SOUND JUST LIKE MY INSANE DAD... okay thats scary)&nbsp;&nbsp; then the world gets ahold of the child and thats when they say (im empty) i hate myself..... </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Oh.. what am i turning into here? a miniture version of my nut bar dad... a dad who told his 4 year old.. that if she did not accept christ satan would devour her.. </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">I am.. im writing something that doesnt really make sense.. and im not high.. oh shit.... </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">ive just, ive had it... ive had every kind of therapy.. i have had abuse by mental health professionals.. ive been emotionally abused by mental health professionals.. and U know.. im supposted to.. turn over my 250 bucks and all my self hatred to another therapist.... who is supposted to do what?? </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">its my decison if i go to my new therapist appointment tomorrow... i guess a part of me wants to go on existing... or else i wouldnt go.... or maybe im just going cause i havent been outta the house in about a week... But, if i dont go.. it really makes no difference..... i think what i was saying last night is.. ive fought the self hatred for so many years.. and i kinda give up.. ive tried everything... So, in order to exist i have to go to my psychiatrist to get the pills to keep me from hurting myself physically..... but to attempt to try to nurture my mind.. to stop the self hatred..&nbsp;&nbsp; its kinda like Ive faced the truth....</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Whoever watched House M.D. tonight it was really good... it was about truth and lies..&nbsp;&nbsp; and why we tell little white lies to people even if its not really good for the person in the long term... but its good for them in the short term...&nbsp; </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">What ive given myself.. is the truth.. The truth is cold and mean and crappy..&nbsp; For example, on House tonight.. a little girl stood up to her mother, her mother who was tryin to protect her by saying, ""oh its okay honey.. mommys gonna be fine theres always hope""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the daughter stood up and said, ""no mom your dying, its not gonna be okay.. everything isnt gonna be fine""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUCH... </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">That was pretty cold of the little girl... telling the truth.. even House thought that.. I was told the truth in aug of 1999.&nbsp; i was told the truth by a psychiatrist.. while my mother was told a white lie.. The white lie gave her hope for the short term.. but wasnt good for reality in the long term....</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">I think that i would have been a lot better if dr boyd had told me the same white lie he told my mom.... because for a year i wouldve had hope.. Hope is what everyone lives on to get through another day...&nbsp; (is that not true)? </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">So.. is it better to give someone who is physically dying hope for the future or is it better to tell them reality??&nbsp;&nbsp; the same in a person who has been emotionally dying for years... Do you continue to give them false hope or do you just surrender to the fact that.. (youve done all you can) that persons soul cannot be saved?</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">The truth.. for the two folks who live here in memphis and who ive chatted with.. i might as well say.... Gary.. both phone conversations have&nbsp;been fake.. a fake person who just wants a friend... (i mean me)&nbsp; (i know that if i act like myself if I show the negative side and the angry side and the fact that i was somewhat not at ease..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... that i will for sure lose your&nbsp;friendship.</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Kai.. after i only talked to you once.. i figured that you were someone that I could be truthful with.. I figured.. Hey.. i can tell him.. that im upset that he didnt check on me... (even though kai i know youve been sick)&nbsp;&nbsp; but thats me.. i feel abandoned... no matter What the other person is going through... and thats a hard trait for people to deal with... but i really figured i could be truthful with U.. </font></p><p><font size=""4""><font color=""#00ff00""><font color=""#0000ff"">well.. i have put so much on the table.. i feel like an idiot.. but i need to go and decide if i wanna bother with any therpy tomorrow.. I hope no one took offense to this.. i hope someone understood it..... cause i hardly understand it myself...</font> </font></font></p><!-- start counter code www.free-website-counters.com --><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""83"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td width=""83"" height=""19""><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.free-website-counters/""></a></td></tr><tr><td height=""13""><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.free-website-counters/""><img height=""13"" alt=""http://www.free-website-counters"" border=""0"" src=""http://www.free-website-counters.com/counter/styles/digital/48/users/26823/sponsor.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.free-website-counters.com/stats/index.aspx?id=26823""><img height=""13"" alt=""http://www.free-website-counters"" width=""34"" border=""0"" src=""http://www.free-website-counters.com/counter/stats.gif"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" height=""15""><a title=""FREE WEBSITE COUNTERS"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.livejournal.com/stc/fck/editor/free%20website%20counters""><font style=""FONT-SIZE: 10px; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">free website counters</font></a> </td></tr></tbody></table><!-- end counter code www.free-website-counters.com --><table cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" width=""130"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td align=""center""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://www.visiblecounter.com/counter/counter.php?countpage=http://kittydresser.livejournal.com/&amp;usr=barclay31"" /></td></tr></tbody></table><a style=""FONT-SIZE: 9px; COLOR: #666666"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cyber-onlinecasino.com/"">Online Casino</a>&nbsp;"

To pay my bills and to refill my own psychiatirct medications. I do not have to fix my hair this weekend, I do not have to move to another residence in Memphis because I dont want to live here. I want to live in California... As, I have written down goals here on this paper, not to drink my dex... There is no reason not to.. (and i failed.. (i drank it)&nbsp; There is only the expensise and only the stomach upset.</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">As I watch now the only show that is really worth watching on Mondays (intervention) I see.. well a rerun of an extreme anorexic with a twin sister, another sister, a mother, a father and a grandfather who are all begging her to get help. </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Its pretty damn hilarious to me, As Paul has left me here and as Uncle Henry has not supported me in the starting of a book project..... There is nothing.. I cannot change my life alone, I do not have a mother or a father or a sister or a brother or grandparents, or hell even one friend who lives in the Memphis area.</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Begging paul to take me back in.. will do nothing..Ive done it all, all i can...

(It cannnot occur soon enough to save the hopelessness and the reality of my life)</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">I am getting so old, 31.. And as I age the chances of finding someone other than Paul to share my life with---someone WHO I LOVE.. someone who I just DO NOT SETTLE FOR.. .. even despite all my many mental health issues and someone who will put up with them grows slimmer with every passing day)</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Also, as I approah 32, the chance of getting one of the most likely.. heriditary cancers that killed my mom, dad and grandmother becomes also greater by the day)&nbsp; I refuse to end what IS a wasted life with a horribly painful, undignified death from cancer.</font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Going back to school is not a viable option either.. because I cannot do the work anymore) I have no concentration left... Also another degree beyond my B.A.&nbsp; will not provide me with any happiness....

When you see at 17.. the end of the physical existance of your father and then 14 years later I see all the fruits of all his education printed in one tiny box on his death certificate... (How many years was the deceased educated it asked) The box marked college and beyond... thats all that his hard work amounted to.. a box on a death certificate. </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">31 years of accomplishing nothing, but only seeing both parents lives come to an end, and then inheriting the legacy of both deaths... the familialial legacy... The hatred that my father had for all his siblings has cost me a family.... out of no fault of my own.... The strain between my mother and her brothers.. before her death has caused her side of the family to hate me... I mean.. just unreal aggressive.. angry hatred.... of no fault of my own..&nbsp; </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Each way that I try to rationalize some way out of this wasted life I reach a dead end. as i say, i am here to tend to georgie and to take my meds.. I know that each option for a way out is blocked.. and is In a firm way in reality not possible. Money and finances stops all hope of the dreams that i mentioned above.. Money also stops any chance of my moving closer to paul.. Paul, himself stops the rest.. The dream of living with someone I love..&nbsp; </font></p><p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">As I still havent payed the extravagent bill of 250 bucks for my visit to a new therapist two weeks ago....

When she asked me, ""what keeps you alive?""&nbsp; I shrugged my shoulders... and i said..""the cats i guess""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have another 250 dollar appointment on wed.. perhaps it will be the last that i can afford.. and if she were to ask me again. ""what do i live for"" I will say.. the chance to get a little high... to get away for a few hours.... but thats all... and that is no life... my life is wasted.. </font></p><p><font size=""4""><font color=""#0000ff"">there is no way out...

They were doing an interview of a mentally ill man who lived alone and was about to manage his illness because of his huge support system. The man would talk about his neighbor..who was a pastor. came to check on him everyday..&nbsp;&nbsp; The mentally ill man didnt think he could make it if he didnt have such a system of support.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought. wow that must be nice.</font></font><p><br /><br /><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Now, im drunk and i want my mommy.... <img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/depressed.gif"" />&nbsp; I want my mom..

I havent been drunk in so long... cause it makes u fat.. and i took a shower and i didnt feel like going to the store or getting cough syrup so i drank three straight shots of my barcardi 151 instead.&nbsp; Im writing down my psychatirct records from when I started therapy at 9.. on that typepad site.. I had to go to the E/R twice in four years for alchohol poisoning.. The second time i dont remember anything. I told paul that I was really sick and to call an ambulance and he did.. and they really came and they strapped me to a strecher and everything and they took me to the hospital and i still dont remember any of it.. I cant remember how much i had to drink that night.. </font></p><p><font size=""4""><font color=""#0000ff"">im outta soda and im fat.. i miss my mom.. i miss my mom.. I miss paul too. why doesnt he love me..&nbsp; No one will be my friend except Kai.. cause im sick.. I wanna take care of baby zoo animals but you gotta go back to school and major in zoolology.. and i dont think it takes that.. It just takes love.. I mean i have hand raised 10 cats.. and it takes a lot of love.. See, like casey and J.J.. they were strays and they were about 2 weeks old and i remember they werent even as big as my hand.. and they were both covered in MASSIVE fleas.. and i was so sad for them.. I took them one at a time and i bathed them in baby shampoo and it took hours to pick all the huge fleas off of their little tiny bodies.. And they could barley see.. there eyes were hardly open.. but they screamed so loud. and Paul and me finally got all the fleas off of them and we covered them each up with a towel and we petted them and fed them a bottle until they both feel asleep and then we put them to bed and then i would get up in the morning really early when they cried and feed them a bottle and make them go to the bathroom.. and comfort them both.... and i did the same with Madeline and Sucky.. and with georgie.. and with charlie... pauls cat...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how come u need a degree to love animals.. i mean to get payed for it<br /><br /><strong><u>SERIOUS SUICIDE IDEALAZATIONS HERE..</u> IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO FEELS LIKE THIS...

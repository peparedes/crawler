"event","Today my nerve block wore off. So that was painful. I upped my medications in anticipation, but it still didn't do enough at the max dose, I was hitting a 6-7 on the pain scale. So I called my pain doctor, who was not in, and then called my surgeon, who was in. Got permission to add a high dose of Aleve to the narcotics, and bingo, that took care of it.

But because of the narcotics at max dose, I'm completely stoned off my ass. I keep blacking out for 5-10 seconds and I can't focus both eyes together. Not terribly fun, but hopefully I can lower the dose to a medium dose and get that a little better."

Having another surgery tomorrow, bright (dark) and early. This one is on the left ankle, to supplement/replace the ligaments with a donor tendon, and then to shave down the bone spur on my fifth metatarsal. 

Had a very stressful weekend, because the hospital couldn't get its administrative act together and left all the pre-surgical paperwork and nursing talk to this morning. So I spent it worried my surgery would get cancelled.

Top it off with my idiot of a new pain doctor saying to ask her to call in my prescriptions today, but she wasn't in the office. It got fixed, but I did not need the aggravation."

Well, despite doing some exercises in PT, I rolled that ankle very badly today. So far it's not hurting terribly much, but it's a bad sign that it can roll that much in the first place. So I'm feeling pretty frustrated about the situation. Planning to call my surgeon tomorrow about whether I should be wearing a brace full time, sadly the answer is probably yes."

Everything went well, everyone was very understanding about the gluten. 

The only annoying thing was that my epidural took forever to wear off, so I was stuck in the recovery room for 5 hours. Boo, it got so boring, but I played soduku with my dad.

Other than that, surgery was a breeze. He fixed my ligaments, sewed up a tear in one peroneal tendon, and sewed a cadaver tendon to the other to support it. 

Now onto recovery."

I&#39;ve got a new diagnosis - plantar fascitis in both feet. Meanwhile, that irritated my posterior tibial tendon (the pain on the inside of my foot) so I&#39;m in a cast for 5 weeks and then I&#39;m getting a specialized brace (Ritchie, if anyone&#39;s curious) that will help calm it down further.

The left foot gets stabs of pain in the arch, aches, burns, and has a ripping pain. There&#39;s pain going up the inside and outside of my foot, particularly when I wiggle my toes. Finally the arch is starting to pronate (collapse inwards). (*cries* The beautiful arch I worked so hard to get.)

So I decided that not only would I stitch by colors and go in sort of free form directions, I&#39;d start in one corner and work my way around until I&#39;d stitched the entire circumference.

The gap between the moon and the green/red leaves is actually going to be a very large frog, that I decided a while back will be the very last part I stitch, so I&#39;m filling in everything around it.&nbsp;<br /><br />The pattern is out of print, and in all my googling I haven&#39;t been able to find a picture of the original art, so I don&#39;t have a picture to show you of what it will look like in the end.

I&nbsp;am now the happy owner of cinnamon clove shampoo that makes my head tingle. 

The hand doctor seemed somewhat befuddled by my hand. He could find no physiological reason for why it was hurting so much, and suggested trying it without any brace whatsoever. I&nbsp;wasn't buying it, but I&nbsp;tried it, and somehow it hurts less. Clearly my hand hates all braces."

"event","I should have more to say, but partly my hand just makes typing so annoying. The thumb continues to be a bit concerning. When I last checked in with my surgeon he thought the brace had been rubbing to cause it, so I stayed in the splint that does not rub. However, it's been more than a week, and not only is it not getting better, but it is spreading. This doesn't seem like something that can be attributed to be rubbing. I'm glad, frankly, because it's a new symptom and hopefully that'll help diagnose it correctly.

In happier news, I have been stitching! Very slowly, with the wrong hand and using my floor stand to hold it, but it's coming along. I'm so pleased to be at it again.

The lovely Doctor Who and Torchwood binge continues. It's really interesting watching it over again with my folks, who haven't seen it before. We're a few episodes into DW&nbsp;series three and TW series one. The best surprise was discovering the giant DW concert on my series three dvds. It was amazing!"

That was to address the Achilles issue that suddenly popped up. Happily, that seems to be resolving itself slowly without further intervention, as long as I'm careful about shoes.</em><em><br /><br /></em>March - Well, I was going to post last night, but then right when the time was supposed to change we lost all power and I could hear the chainsaws going nearby, so something fell. <em>Weather sure has been nutty this year. Like a white Christmas that was 50 degrees.<br /><br /></em>April - Well, in a few hours it will be two weeks. <em>The last - fingers crossed - major foot surgery! That recovery went really well, the foot doesn't so much as peep at me and I'm not even a year past the surgery.<br /><br /></em>May - Well, I have made it to six weeks post op. <em>Past the coma period! I was so exhausted after this surgery. Must remember not to schedule ops so closely.<br /><br /></em>June - <span class=""postbody"">Woohoo! I started this last August, but then I didn't stitch for five months, so it took about four months to do. <em>Stitching! Such a major part of my life. This year I finished Altengamme, made huge progress on Rev, some of Patchwork, and half of a secret project.<br /><br /></em>July - </span>Oh, for crying out loud. It's 6:00 a.m. and I still haven't gotten to sleep! <em>The joy of trying</em> of trying to balance sleep.&nbsp; I was doing better, but then the anemia set all of that back.<br /><br />August - I have decided my health insurance sucks, which surprises me a bit because it is normally so good.&nbsp; <em>I've acquired many new doctors this year, most recently a hand surgeon. Oh, insurance.</em><br /><br />September - Today was lovely. <em>It's the idyllic period of going back to school, before I got sick and it all fell apart. I'm on medical leave for next spring as well. The first two weeks were wonderful though.</em><br /><br />October - I had my first public economics midterm today (we have two, don't ask), and all things considered I'm reasonably pleased with how it went. I really did love this class. <em>My biggest regret about missing next spring is that I was going to take another course by the same instructor.</em><br /><br />November - It's a good day! <em>President Obama. Boy I love saying that.</em><br /><br />December - This morning coming down from breakfast, I slipped on the stairs, grabbed the railing, and sprained my wrist, though happily not my dominant one. <em>That one got better in a few days. And was on the other hand. This one is not looking that good.</em><br />"

"event","Well, I'm back at my folk's for Thanksgiving. The train took forever, but it wasn't too bad. 

New injuries! I have a blister on my little toe in the cast. Owies. Also, that foot is acting up, probably because the cast doesn't fit well anymore. 

My pain doctor called while I was on the train and we chatted a while. He keeps pushing the idea of medicating the withdrawal from Cymbalta. His latest idea was putting me on klonipin, a heavy duty sedative, during the withdrawal. So I can function even less? He doesn't seem to understand that I simply want to avoid withdrawal. Hence the second opinion I'm getting next week.

Tomorrow I have an appointment with my GP. Hopefully we can pursue some avenues of investigation regarding the whole mess. I really do think there's an underlying immune issue. Say what you like about returning to college for the first time in years and new germs, but I didn't react this way when I moved to a whole new country's germs."

Apparently the best thing for it is wet heat, but this is challenging to carry around on campus when it's less than 30 degrees outside. 

I've been stitching a lot in the last few weeks, but with the eyes it's just too hard to look at a pattern. I miss it. I was trying again this afternoon but I only managed the tiniest bit of a ""T"" (pretend that was a dramatic curly font) before putting it aside."

"event","It appears that I am anemic, which account for some of the exhaustion and feeling like crap. I haven't gotten the labs back on my iron count yet, but the CBC showed anemia and my pain management doctor took one look at me and out of the blue asked if I was anemic, so I feel like it's a pretty safe bet. 

In a way it's good, because it's fixable, but apparently it takes a while to start feeling better, so that sucks. In the I am an idiot category, I completely forgot to fill the prescription for iron this weekend so now I need to mail it into Medco, and they're always a hassle. I could potentially get some over the counter, but I need a higher dose or something. 

At the moment I don't think I'm sick, but I'm still exhausted. I'm taking two or three naps a day. Part of the fatigue may also be the Cymbalta. I talked to my pain management doctor about that on Friday and we're going to start tapering down. The initial thought is to see how low I can go before the pain in my foot starts breaking through. Then I'm going to evaluate how crappy I still feel and decide whether just dealing with the pain in my foot would be a better option. There aren't very many medications that manage nerve pain, and I seem to be unable to take each one for various reasons.

In foot news, I have a bright pink cast now. I got it wet in the snow last week so had to make an unscheduled trip home to get that changed. The foot isn't too painful, but it's not amazing either. It still feels much better than earlier, but I'm not holding out much hope I'll get out of this without surgery.

While I was home, I did manage to get some shopping done. I haven't really been out in a real winter for three or for years, since these last few I just lived in sweats after my surgeries. So when it started getting cold here two weeks ago, I abruptly discovered that I hadn't bought new winter clothes since high school and that I was in desperate need of warm things. In a miracle of shopping, I came away with five pairs of pants - that fit! - plus a bunch of lightweight tops and sweaters for layering. I even found corduroy pants, which I have been wanting for years."

"event","Okay....1st off...I'm in a better mood than earlier...these mood swings are so not cool!

Okay on a serious note, I've seen some weird things lately. On Sunday night, I was in the office and I saw a white/silver flash...it wasn't really a ball...but more of a wiggly line. It went across a pillow on the sofa. It didn't really scare me...It just kind of freaked me out, but not a whole lot..it was just weird.  Then last night, I was in my parent's bedroom, and on the bed, I seen the same thing...but this time it wasn't just once...I saw it twice. The 1st time I kinda seen it out of the corner of my eye, then the next time it was going up towards the ceiling/head of the bed. This time, it kinda scared me a lil...I haven't told my mom this...cuz she'll think i'm cwazy.

Anyway, I'm chatting with D now, and I think i'll go play ts2 in a minute :D"

Everyone online and offline has been so nice and good to me. I'm luckly to have friends/family like them!

Yesterday, we got an alarm installed for our house.  I like it a lot.  I feel safer with it.  Today I got my new glasses! They are so kewl!! hehe I like them.....yet they also make me said cuz its the last thing my dad bought for me :(

Well I have next week off from school because its fall break! So YAY! I haven't updated this thing in forever! Also, I need to give it a fall makeover.

"event","I didn't goto church today...my mom let me sleep in hehe.  So basically all afternoon, I just watched TV and srufed on the internet hehe.  Then I started working on my homework....MATH! I had to do a take home test...and that was soo hard! Then I had just regular math problems to do...I got most of them...but then the more I did...the more I started to get wrong...so I stopped while I was ahead! LOL Tomorrow we are reviewing for our test.  I'm nervous about our test which is Tuesday....

Well my joella got her NL to install!! Yay!! Its fun that now we can talk about it together hehe! I think I am going to start playing ts2 sum during the week...to see if that helps take my mind off school...also I just remembered that I was going to try to make an alien-zombie-vampire!! I'm going to try to make one hehe...I also kind of want to try the legacy challenge...or some version thereof hehe

Also, after posting about my sleep paralysis...I looked it up on the net, and read some stuff that made me feel better.  1st - it said that usually sleep paralysis doesn't last as long as you feel like it does....so 10 minutes can easily be a minute or even 10 seconds! Then they said that you can avoid sleep paralysis most of the time by: [1] avoiding naps [2] having a regular sleep schedule....so yea I feel better now...

Not much other news besides that tomorrow is my Madre's birthday!! :D Now I think i'll go shower and eat something before bed hehe"

"event","I woke up today kind of early to be a Saturday.  I woke up at 10:00am lol. I woke up early because my mom and I were going to meet my dad at the Greek Festival for lunch. My dad had to work today because they were busy with hurricane Ophelia.  My mom and I got at Greek Fest at about 11:00am...and We met up with my dad and went into the festival.  First thing we did was eat!! :P I got the Chicken Riganato [baked chicken in olive oil, garlic, oregano] that came with Greek style green beans and rice pilaf.  I also got Spanakopita which is Layers of filo pastry and a mixture of spinach and feta cheese baked into a pie! That is my favorite Greek dish! I also ate some Greek salad! Then after we ate, we watched people preform traditional Greek dances! Over all it was fun hehe

Then my mom and I came home.  I came online and then decided to take a nap.  Then it happened, as it often does.  I had another episode of sleep paralysis. It was the worst yet. I know I had to have struggled with it for 20 minutes.  Usually when I realize I am experiencing it, I quickly stop trying to move and let myself go right back to sleep so I can wake up. Well this time....it didn't work.  I laid on the couch for what seemed like forever trying to go back to sleep or at least let myself go back to being unconscious...it lasted forever...I couldn't go back to sleep, and I couldn't wake up....usually they last for about 10 seconds...well this time I think it lasted for 10 minutes...then I went back to sleep on to have it happen again. Well this latest incident, I have made the decision to seek help.  I am starting to worry that I have something wrong with me neurologically....I'm also afraid that if this continues to happen untreated, I might go into a coma or something. Hopefully there is help out there, so I no long have to be troubled with this.

Then after I woke up, I went back online and messed around.  Then my dad came home and we had dinner. I got Chicken Lo Mein for dindin. It was pretty good, but I think I still like Vegtable Lo Mein better! I didn't get a fortune cookie! :( 

So then tonight I watched stuff about New Orleans on the History channel and played with my simmies.

Also, my cousin is okay now. She has been put on bedrest."

"event","I am so tired, and with that I am glad that I am done with school for the week! Yay! Had  a busy week, but at least it went by fast.  School is what has been keeping me busy.  Stupid math class is making me and everyone else in that class go insane! We're doing fractions now....and they are hard! Its not that we don't really know how to do them....its just that the teacher gives us such awkward numbers to work with! We had a quiz yesterday...and everyone did so bad that the teacher is not going to count it! Yay! But we are having to do a take home quiz....heh...SO yea...I like most of the people in my class...most are easy to get along with...and actually most of the people in that class are civil [meaning nice] unlike most of the people back in hs...i think its b/c most of the ppl there are a tad older and wiser lol...



Tomorrow is my mom's last day at work :( She is going to really miss working there...but nothing stays the same forever..*sigh* but at least she has found another job...so things aren't all bad :)

Today when I came home from school, my aunt and lil cousin was here.  We ate lunch and chatted for awhile...it was nice to visit with them.  Then later we went outside [i didn't really want too, kinda hot for me, but u know lil kids love outside so yea hehe :P] So as my mom and aunt chatted...i played hide-n-seek with my cousin :P  I hadn't played hide-n-seek in years...it was fun...she got so excited when she would win :P 

So then after they left, my mom and I went to costco and got water and some other things [they had this snowman globe thing that was huge and it was so cute!! hehe...anyway]. Then after we left costco, we went down to EB Games and I bought Nightlife! Yay! 

I came home, took a shower, installed nightlife, and played for awhile! Then I took a nap...got up...ate sum dinner...came online for a few minutes and played nl again...now i think i might go play again before going to bed hehe

Yeah..but on a sadder note...earlier tonight my cousin was taken to the hospital...thought it was premature labor...now things seem to be okay...will say more when i know more lol

And tomorrow is my joella's birthday!! :D"

So I woke up feeling cruddy, and then my parents told me that they wanted to go off.  I didn't really feel like going off, but they said I could stay in the car and sleep, and they said they'd tend to me :P So before we left, I called EB games and asked if they had The Nightlife Guide in, and they didn't...i was so sad lol.

So, we went to Raleigh and ate lunch at Char-Grill!! mmmm it was sooo good! Then we stopped at a lot of different places for my parents.  Then we went to a wal-mart, and I decided to go in.  I wanted to see if by an off chance they had the Nightlife guide.....and they did! I was shocked because they have such a limited game section, and when I found the guide rack, it was tiny! But they had a whole bunch of them! :D
I was so excited when I got it! *bumbles* It made me feel slighty better :P

So then we do a few more earrands and we come home.  On the way home, I read the guide! I cannot wait for nightlife! weee! I'm so excited! :D Then for dindin, I had sum pizza and a salad! :D

Now I'm watching UFOs: Seeing is Believing.  In a little while, I think I might go play ts2, and get rid of the costume content. Then I might go lay down and watch TV."

So yeah....last weekend [Labor Day weekend], we went to Atlantic Beach for 2 days.  It was nice to get away and forget reality for awhile :P.  I spent time swimming and eating....mmm the food was good! 

Then this week, I had my 1st english test, and my 1st midterm in math! The math midterm was sooo hard! *wimpers* I hope I did okay....

As I have for like the past 2 weeks, I have been mainly watching coverage of Hurricane Katrina. 

Yesterday, I updated myspace!! I added music and a comment box! I'm going to start working on getting myspace a fall/halloween update.  I'm also going to change LJ too.  I'm still excited about the release of Nightlife! I heard today that Brazil got the game....that kinda makes me mad.  I won't get the game until Thursday of next week! However, I think this weekend, I'll buy the prima guide of nightlife.  To prepare my game for NL, I did delete some of the custome content that I downloaded, I'll get rid of the rest to get ready for NL!

Yesterday, I finally took my car to the carwash! It needed washing badly! I can't even rememeber the last time my car has been washed! LOL  Then last night, I got really sick, but I feel much better now!! :D

After the chat, I ate someting and then went right to bed, I wasn't feeling good.  Then this morning, my mom woke me up saying it was time to get ready for the baby shower.  I still wasn't feeling well, so I didn't go heh.  I hate I missed it because I wanted to see everyone, but I didn't feel like going, oh well lol.  

I had some dreams, some pretty interesting ones at that lol.  Well, my frist dream was that we had moved. We moved into this really old house, it was like this huge historic mansion.  It had a past to it, meaning that it was haunted since it had a lot of history, some of it was dark. [Murders, etc].  We arrived at the house at night lol [how fitting for a haunted house...] Well we got settled, and that night, I went exploring around the house.  The house had a basement, and then 3 floors above the basement.  [4 floors in all lol] So I explored downstairs, Then I decided to look for a room to be my bedroom.  So I went up to to the 3rd floor.  Off the hallway, I found this big room, and off that big room was another room, and I liked it, it had a nice view, and it was perfect in size.  I was planning on how I was going to fix it up, and thinking of what color to paint the room lol.  Then I realized that my room was next to the master bedroom [not the bedroom i walked through to get to this room. the master was off the hallway] And I remembered that I was told never to go in the master bedroom, and just shut the door and never go in there and the ghost's won't bother us, so that freaked me out, and I didn't want to be right next to it lol.  So I went to the 1st floor, and found a cute lil room next to the living room and kitchen.  Then I seen that it was right across from the stairs to the basement. [Another haunted area.] That freaked me out, and also I remember that my parents room was on the 2nd floor, and I wanted to be with them lol.  

So then I was outside at my house now, and I seen Prince! [Joella's cat] So i was like ""omg! prince what are you doing here!?! I gotta get you back to joella! She's probably worried sick!"" So I picked him up, and walked to Joella's house. and then me and her just chilled lol"

So then I got on the puter, and surfed around and did stuff online.  I updated my SimPage, it needed it LOL I also did a lot of simming today.

I don't have much planned for tomorrow, but I do want to do some of my homework so I won't have to do so much on sunday lol  For awhile now Joella and I have been wondering when we started chatting, and we knew that our 1 year anniversary was comming up.  So then Joella remembered that she put it in an old journal, and she found it!!! *bumbles*  We started talking on September 4th, 2004!! I'm happy that mystery is solved lol :D

"event","Yay! School is over for the week for me!! It's so nice to be out for the next 4 days!! *bumbles*

I woke up today at 6:15am! *spaz* I'm suppose to get up at 6am, but i didn't wake up on time! Waking up at 6:15am only allowed me 15 minutes to get ready and get my stuff together since I have to leave at 6:30 or i'll be late.  So yeah, I had to rush to get ready and stuff! On tuesdays and thursdays when i have to leave so early my dad and I leave together and we follow each other since he goes the same way to work lol Today I wanted to go a different way other than the highway since sometimes that gets backed up and I'll be late, but anyway, i was by my car on the street, and i was getting the water off my windows, and my dad backs out of the driveway and almost goes on w/o me!!!! I was like ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING! O_O STOP!!!!!!!"" so i hit my horn [heh kinda early for that noise but anyway...] so he stopped and i got in and we went on our way...So then we were downtown, and he was going on all these streets that was all confusing, and I was like ""ookay i know where we're going but idk why hes going this way, its easier the other way, but yeah"" So yea i finally got to my school :P So I go to my English class....geez I still can't get use to it starting at 7:00am! But we call that class 'English with grandma"" since the teacher is so old lol 

So during our break, I went to the student lounge, and got something to drink [i had *no* time this morning before I left to get something to drink] I got a Minute Maid Strawberry Passion drink! It's the 1st I've ever had! It was so good!! I gotta get another one! :P

So I'm just chilling drinking Hi-C, I'm waiting for my mom to get off work, then we're going to get groceries for tonight! I'm making Chinese BBQ chicken!! I can't wait :P I'm hungry now and idk wat to eat :P"

Earlier today, my mom and I went to get me some school supplies, and then I got some jeans. I always need more jeans, I go through them quickly lol....all the jeans had holes in them! lmao But I got a pair that had just a lil bit of holes that weren't too big hehe Then we met my dad for lunch at Copelands! We love that place, and I haven't been there in so long! I've only been there twice, and this makes 3 times. My mom and I shared the blackend bayou chicken....mmmm so sergio, and for dessert we had this brownie with ice cream and carmel stuff! OMG so good! heh...kinda sad lol that some of my highlights are food! LMAO!

I also took a nap today hehe I didn't sleep too good. I had several weird dreams...one about familia and one about me walking home from someplace and then getting sprayed with like weed killer lol

Tonight I realized something.  I realized that this summer reminds me a lot of the summer before 9/11.  The summer of 2001...I've done a lot of the same things which reminds me of that summer...also i'm starting a new school, just like that summer....kinda makes me think lol, but I know i'm superstitious and draw parrells between things, and i know it means nothing, but I can't help it lol

"event","<P>I haven't been up to much today hehe.&nbsp; I got up and watched TV, then came online and chatted with Joella, Missy and others lol.&nbsp; While online, I downloaded Mozilla by firefox, its pretty kewl, but sadly it looks like I'll have to stick with MSN.&nbsp; I don't really like MSN, and IE is not good at all, but I like the format of Mozilla, but it is not compatable with all websites *cough*LiveJournal*cough* so i guess i'll use it for somethings lol</P>
<P>I was on MySpace earlier too! Those bulletins are making me mad. I don't like getting those chain things.&nbsp; I know I don't have to repost them, but I feel that I have too.&nbsp; Call me superstitious, stupid, whatever, but if I open it, I gotta repost it. I know I don't appreciate getting that kind of crap, and I know other people don't like getting them, and I feel kind of guilty by passing it along, so i'm not doing bulletins no more.&nbsp; I might do them from time to time if its a survey, special announcement, etc.....[This now conculdes my daily rant. :P] lol</P>
<P>School is starting really soon. *scared* I'm nervous about starting a new year, new school, new environment, etc lol Also, I'm thinking about getting a new screen name for yahoo. I'm thinking about getting like a new identity. [of course I will still talk to my friend Joella!] But I kind of want to start anew, and sort of move on from some of the people online.&nbsp; I'm leaving all the people from high school behind and so I should kind of leave everyone online behind too.&nbsp; Once nightlife comes out, I'll be able to get a new SN for ts2 site, so I might just move on. I'm just thinking about doing this lol</P>
<P>hehe Joella told me today that she'll be able to get nightlife!! yay! Hopefully we can both get it when it comes out and can play together and find out new stuff together! :P hehe</P>
<P>Also....I kind of in the mood to get a golf club and go run around outside and hit cars with it!! hehe me in weird mood! :P</P>"

"event","Last night i was kind of depressed again, and i was thinking about me and why i feel this way.  Well I realized that I feel this way because awhile back I finally faced reality.  For so long I always thought of myself as someone else.  Someone who has it all, had great looks, had the great body, wasn't shy, etc, just anybody who wasn't me.  But then I decided to face reality, and I found out that well I'm just a loser. I don't have the great body, I don't have the nice looks....quite the opposite. I use to think that by not facing reality, I was just fooling everyone else, then I realized that I wasn't fooling no one but me. By fooling myself, I atleast had some self-confidance, but I don't have any now or so it seems.  At least back then I at least thought I could do things, but now, I know I can't. I ain't going to be young much longer either! I just finished high school, and now people have told me the best years are gone... WTF those were the best? wow. 

I'm just f**ked up.  Maybe I'm depressed cuz i'm jealous. [wow something else to add to the list that sucks about me.]I've never had what others had when it comes to relationships. Sure I've had and have friends, but only a very *few* have I felt extremely comfortable around.  Sure we might go someplace like the mall but it wasn't like I could be truly myself around them.  I always thought it was their fault that it was something about them that made me feel shy, or that I couldn't be myself.  That was back when I didn't face reality. Now that I do, I can see that its ME! I'm the one with the problem, I'm the f**ked up one. :(

Sometimes people wouldn't accept me....once again I always thought it was them. Then I thought about maybe why they don't accept me. Its cuz of what a loser I am.  Seriously, who would want to be associated with me????????? I guess the depression is cuz i'm having such a hard time accepting all of this. Suicide is not the answer, I know that ok.  The last thing I want to do is die. But i just want to know what it must be like to have it all.  Also, why is it fair that some have things and others don't??? Why should I have to feel this way, when others don't have all stuff that I have or have to suffer with? 

its gotten so that I don't wanna watch tv or talk to people because on tv i see people who have what I don't...its like a constant reminder that i'm a f**king loser, who has always been one, will always be one...that i'm overweight, my hair is ugly, i'm ugly, its just like a slap in the face.  Another problem is, that i tend to keep all this to myself....[yet another flaw....am i the most screwed up person ever?!?]thats not good at all...whenever I have these thoughts, instead of dealing wit them or talking time out, I just push them to the back and its like I can't do that no more....its built up too much...i think thats why i might feel this way...grr i'm sick of my past ruining my future! When i have these thoughts, i just tend to force them in the back, and sometimes when I feel this way and am thinking about me and stuff no one can tell cuz its like I hide it behind something like randomness [no, when i'm random doesn't mean i'm always depressed]

*sigh*"

So I get up and my mom and I go to college to pay for my classes, and then we goto get my books....well as it turns out, they didn't have them out yet lol So thats something else I have to add to my list that still needs to get done...and also in addition to that I still have to get all my parking stuff....*sigh*

After there, we went to Office Max to look at this desk I seen in the sunday advert....it might work....its the right size but the color doesn't really match my room, and it had no drawers just shelves, but it might work...then my mom brought my by home and she went to the store, and came back with food --- a cheeseburger just for me! :P

Then the rest of the afternoon I was just plain out lazy! ROFL At dinner, I got to watch 'The Golden Palace'! I was so excited, I've never seen that before, and since i'm a huge golden girls fan it was quite a joy to see it! Its nice to see some new golden girl type episodes after seen reruns after all these years lol

"event","My Dreams:

I just awoke and had a ton of dreams while sleeping...

The 1st dream that I remember was being at college and getting my books...and the lady at the book store would not let me see them cuz it was policy and I was like ""ookay"".  She said that the teacher would show them to me on the 1st day of class.

Then my mom and I went to the dentist. Well while we were waiting, I noticed that she had moved her office into this weird old house...anyway, I got called back...and the dentist was talking to me...a lot more than usual, and I was like ""wtf?""...anyway she started acting really weird and before now I noticed that she was dressed differently and her hair was different.  So then things were getting ever more weird.  Well at about this time, her husband, comes around and he was in a bathrobe, and they looked like they were both going to laugh...and then it hit me! They were like the parents from Meet The Fockers!!!! And it turns out they were playing with all their patients that day...*strange*

Then it was like in this whole long dream that we were like moving out of our house or at least not staying in it for some reason.  Also, nothing looked like it does around here...everything looked more californiaish..it was sunny and such lol

So then my mom and i went to our new home or whatever it is...it was the end of the day..and we were tired....the place we were staying at sucked sooo bad....I mean it was terrible...our furniture wasn't there or had come yet..or this was our stuff o_O Anyway...The Living room/kitchen was combined and the bedroom was next to the LR, and the bathroom was between the two, very small house, almost like an apartment.  So since it was getting late, I made my bed on the couch and went to bed....

So the next day lol, we got up, and my mom and I did errands.  So then we were comming home, and I had to pee really bad...so i was like ""mom go faster""...so we finally get home...and i goto the bathroom...and while going, i notice that the bathroom has no door...and that the bathroom door aligns right with the front door, and the front door is open. So I'm like ""woahzit""...the street is like 2 feet from the door, and its like a 6 lane busy busy street....and everyone is seeing me go!! :-O So I like scream for my mom to close it...

So then my dad comes home...and we eat or something...then we're like driving back to our old place....and as we are walking in, we see all these famous people walking out...and they were all dressed in uniform...and i realize there from the show ""Security Guards"" [Popular TV show in nemo's dream world...yes my dream world is like the sims, anything goes..:P] So we ask this lady at the desk...and she said they had moved the studio to here.  So we walk to our old apartment...and right next to it was the studio..[of course we had to move right when famous people came] So while in the place, my mom was in hurry, saying that they would come for us if we didn't hurry and get out.  So I was like *yikes* so i was like shoving all I Could into this bag, since I knew we wouldn't be back to get the rest...so as I was continuing to grab everything i could...then i realized that i would have to drive my car back, and it was storming and night outside and i didn't know my way back..so my mom was like well u'll  have to follow us..""lets go..quickly!"" she said.  SO as she and my dad were leaving, i realized that I needed to get one more thing...so i got it...and went to the parking lot to see my parents drive off wit out me...""shit""

So i get in my car with my stuff and like start driving...i suddenly remember the way to our new place...on the way i go through this awesome area...kinda like Las Vegas! *bumbles* So i see this awesome hotel/club/office/apartment building...and I saw a sign saying they had room for apartments...so i was like maybe we can live here instead of that crappy house.  So i walk in, and the buildings theme was like the 1920s/1930s or like 1940s...like art deco or whatever...so i see a sign pointing to the elevators...so along the way...i see this ballroom full of people dancing..and have fun..so i goto the elevarots and i get on one of them, and push the floor for the apartments...and while its going up...i look around the elevator...i notice that the back of the elevator is open, and its got no glass, and it looks over the dance floor below...and its so awesome..then i remember that i had heard that some girl fell out of the elevator by looking out...so yeah..i get out of the elevator...and I'm on the apartment floor...and i cant look at any of them so i'm like ""psh"" so I decide to leave...so i find the elevators again, and this time one is already open for me...[when will i learn that in dreams never go to the open one!] so i get on and it takes me to the top of the building, on like the 40th floor, and I can't get out none of the elevartors work, and there are no stairs...so i like panic and still none of them work! I'm stuck!

So then...somehow i'm back outside and along the strip....and I see these 2 military guys riding bumber cars and crashing into each other hehe...so i'm like there gunna get hurt then they both run into a street like..and i'm like told ya :P and they laugh...so then i'm like sitting in my car...and I see this d00d on a motorcycle and it explodes...and i see that only his legs and butt are on the motorcycle and that the top half is gone! So i'm like ""omg omg!"" then i felt something grab me and i see somone hold their arms around my neck...and it turns out to be that guy and his still alive, and his holding on to me...so i like panic and run screaming...and see blood and body parts all around me...and then thats when i woke up...."

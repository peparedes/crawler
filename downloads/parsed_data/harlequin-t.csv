"event","For reasons I choose not to give at this time...I took a hiatus from livejournal. But I am going to start writing again just to see if people are as dead as they were right before I left. Anyways...what has happend since I last wrote? I did finally get talked into playing World of Warcraft and it has been fun so far. I had an online romance with a beautiful woman who is a cop in LA. The only reason it stayed online is because our schedules did not coincide well at all. This being said...us never being able to link up...the online romance fizzled. Not that I care...would have been nice to have someone, but I'm not really in any position at this time to be in any kind of long term relationship...which is what she was looking for. My family got into some legal trouble because of something my grandfather did. My brother is still with that whore of a woman he calls his fiance'. The problem with that is...she is his first love and first lay...because of this he has an attachment to her. Well, she keeps cheating on him and he keeps giving her another chance. On his behalf...I find a love that forgiving admirable...but I find someone who would stay in a relationship that is doomed to failure a fool. I'm working on getting rid of her as we speak. On my way to Magic Mountain (an amusement park), my car made a funny popping noise. My friend got out and checked and it seemed fine. We continued driving and were told, by some passing cars, that the car was on fire. After a swift exit, a try with a fire extinguisher, and a few trips to get everything of value out...it 'sploded...well...the front end did. The fire dept. got to the car before the flames reached the full tank of gas. As far as that...I have heard rumors that we are going to war again...but most likely not with Iraq this time. I don't care either way...but I do want to see more of the world than the desert in another country. That is about as updated as I can get everyone at this time though."

"event","and no, i am not talking about World of Warcraft you noobs. I refuse to play it. REFUSE!!! I am perfectly happy playing Star Wars Galaxies and there is nothing you can do to change my mind. ALSO, I finished watching season 1 of Smallville, they forced me...well, no, they forced me to watch season 3, but I had to know what happened in season one so I watched it. NOW i don't have season two and am really pissed! HOW can they have me watch season 3 before 1 then tell me they don't have 2? WHAT is this? Someone just tripped the fire alarm in our barracks, great, spiffy, that makes my night...oh yes, now I will have to stand in the cold watching my building burn....in fact...i'm not leaving...I am fortified in concrete damnit, they can't make me leave...well...they actually can.

"event","Well, my stay home has been fruitfull if nothing else. I have managed to pay off almost all of my outstanding $10,000 dollars worth of debt that, till now, I have put off paying for like...two or more years. Yeah, my credit is bloody well fucked up. The only thing I have left to pay off is a debt that I actually didn't get myself in to. APPARENTLY, I lived in a trailer park by the name of Paradise Hills (the jury is still out on whether or not that is even here in Amarillo) and while living there I also apparently stopped paying rent...got evicted...then sued for not paying what was owed. Now, don't get me wrong...I am most likely a piece of shit...at least in most people's eyes...but I have never been evicted from any place...much less a trailer park...nor have I ever LIVED in a trailer park. SO, anyways I have to file a claim...which I have no idea how to even go about doing....so that I can clear my credit once and for all. Then I have to start on rebuilding such said credit. In other news...every time I come home...I seem to lose my barracks room key. Last time I think that it was not lost, but stolen as a token by a girl I was er...friendly with last X-mas...if you want to know the details..it is in my journal around X-mas time last year. Anyways, I seem to have misplaced this one and that is a very bad thing. I might get my car completely fixed and actually drive it back to Cali...and that would be awesome for more than one reason. And I have visited many friends and fam that I have not seen in a long while. Everything is turning out better than expected...save for that stupid F-ing barracks key...damn...I really need to find that. I'm going to go look for it some more"

"event","I got a tattoo today. Well...technically I got two...one on each arm, both black and white. I went black and white for the reason that I am of the opinion that, with all the shading, they have more detail than they would with color On my right arm I have a smiling, vampiric, jester clown with the phrase, ""smile now"" beneath it, and on my left I have a frowning, vampiric, jester clown with the phrase, ""cry later"" written underneath. They turned out really well, and the whole ordeal wasn't as painful as I imagined it would be. These two being my first tats, I had no clue what to expect. Now all I have to do is keep good care of them for about two to three weeks whilst they heal, and they should end up looking great. At the moment they look awesome, save for the blood color that is stained on them. Although I think that the red eyes do look kind of cool...I may have them touched up to add that later. I'm staying with a friend tonight who went with me to get one as well. His is a quote from the book, ""Hitch hikers Guide to the Galaxy, or Universe or something or another. The quote is, ""I never could get the hang of thursdays"". I have yet to read the book, but I heard it is hilarious. Tomorrow when I get back to the place I am staying while I am in town, I will take some pics and post them for all to enjoy."

"event","The first thing is that I got a Certificate of Comendation for being on the guard force for our camp (Baharia). It's not as high as a Navy Achievement Award, but it IS higher than a Meritorious Mass (if you get three of these you get promoted...theoretically anyways). It was nice to get, but it really doesn't mean anything...at least I don't think it does...well it might, who knows...whatever. Second, they told us that our flights outta here will be on the 6th to the 8th of October...which means I will be back in Cali around the 9th or the 10th I think. I haven't gotten my leave papers back, so I don't remember what days I asked for...but it was for 18 days. I know it was approved, because I'm not on the duty roster. When I find out the days I will update.  Immediately when we get back we will have 96 hours off...during this time I will change banks, purchase a cellphone to re-establish my communication with the real world, and begin paying off my $10+ dollars of debt I owe. This will take up virtually every penny I earned out here, but I will be free of any obligatory debts to anyone...so it is worth it. Depending on how much money I will have (after evalutating exactly how much more than 10k dollars I owe) I will either purchase a ticket and fly home...or try to find a ride. If I can't find a ride from either a Marine buddy, hometown friend, or a family member....then I will hitch-hike.....just kidding. Anyways, the people that are replacing us...3/5 are a bunch of pompus and arrogant assholes that keep talking about how they are going to vastly improve on this base and how it is run. They have been here for a whole 72 hours and they think they know everything and are acting like they already run shit. Whatever man, good luck...good riddance...they can have the whole damn country for all I care case I am out. :) See you all soon."

Current mood: provoked 

invoked by none other than Krys
THE RULES:
1 -- Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed.
2 -- I will respond; I'll ask you five questions.
3 -- You'll update your journal with my five questions, and your five answers.
4 -- You'll include this explanation.
5 -- You'll ask other people five questions when they want to be interviewed.

Disclaimer: I'm just being honest.


1. Do you have a deformity (mental also counts)? Yes, I have social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder (whatever that is suppose to mean) and mild clinical depression. OH! and neither one of my pinkies will straighten completely out.

2. If you had a stalker what would be their signiture? Er, how am I suppose to know...if I were a stalker it would be a single rose (I would be the romantic kind of stalker :P )But um...if I had one he/she would probably send me things like...fresh apples with an artificial eye stiched inside where the core is supposed to be. 

3. Create a written visual image. 5'4"" 145lbs, brown hair, brown eyes (they turn olive green sometimes) medium build, stylish wireframe glasses...or contacts when I feel like messing with them. I have a slight overbite, but everyone says they can't tell, and no shit...real fangs...just slightly longer than usual canines. Usually clean shaven, because it is manditory in the military...and a basic military haircut. The clothes I usually wear usually consist of a t-shirt (usually black) with some kind of witty, funny, sick, or deranged saying on it, cargo pants (usually black), and some comfortable shoes...usually sketchers or vans. Hm....girls describe me as either kinda cute, or not bad...so I am still wondering on that one. 

4. Tell me what you feel when listening to trance (inebriated or not). Lol, well...while not inebriated...it is just good listening. It puts me in a better mood, mellows me out, makes that particular moment a little more feng shui. And inebriated is a whole different story, depending on what I am inebriated on. On alcohol it is just as above, just more of the mellowing, everything is alright feeling. But on dex, I don't just hear the music, I feel it, it's like I am swimming in a sea of sound...surounded by it. It feels like my heart is matching every beat and my mind is an orchestra playing a harmony. 

5. Describe your best kiss ever. Sadly, I have never been both emotionally AND phsyically involved with a girl, it is either one or the other. The ones I was emotionally tied to, I never had any physical contact with...God only knows why. The other girls I was with were pretty much on the same sheet of music I was...It was a physical relationship, no emotion on either side. So the best kiss I ever had is probably tied to the best sexual experience I had...and I'm not going to tell you that :P"

Being in the military, and having the knowledge of what is really meant of the word that is passed down...this means that we will probably be home around the 15th of Oct. That is if we don't get extended, our relief shows up and gets established on time, we don't all get blowd up...etc. Anways...it's taken awhile...but this place has finally got to me. I came here in February, and I was doing real good about not counting the days, and trying my hardest to use self hypnosis to make myself think that I had only been in country for a small amount of time. Well, I messed up and looked at a calendar...and that is what messed me all up. Now I know how long I've been here, and how long I still have to be here...and I am now drawn to the conclusion that...hm...yup...I uh, I hate this place....yeah...I really hate it here. So, that being said...I am going to go outside for a second...take an axe out of one of the vehicles...and destroy the tree right outside the shop. Yup, I feel like destroying something...and I don't like that tree...it is a eucalyptus and it smells funny...Actually, I think the real reason I am so angry is that not only do MSN and Yahoo! messengers not work, but my crafty little plan with the AIM isn't working as well as expected for several reasons: I don't know anyone who is on AIM...no one has added me, which is very depressing...and the one person that I need to contact (my bro) is unreachable at this time...

We caught a big ass camel spider that the shop named ""camel toe"", but someone let it go...so he is now seeking revenge over his entrapment somewhere around the tent. Not too much is going on besides that...save for the fact that I am no longer on camp guard, which is good...it was getting very repetitive. Anyways, I am still alive and unharmed and should be back in the United States no later than Oct 1st...and hopefully back in Amarillo for leave around mid or late October. See you all then... A Salaam Meleka n' stuff."

"event","The days are getting closer now to my departure, I can pretty much count them on one hand if I take out this weekend. This past week I have shot the Squad Automatic Weapon or SAW, which is a type of machine gun, Battle Sited my M16, and pretty much just sat around. All of our stuff is already packed up and ready to go, so there isn't much for us to do. I think I have givin my snail mail addy to all who wanted it, but if not...you can get it from me if you ask, or you can get it from my brother. I really don't have much to write at the moment. Last night I saw From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money, the cheese factor on that movie was really high...bad acting mixed with a slew or corny one-liners. Ick, it was worse than the first one. Anyways, for all of you who observe this retched holiday...have a happy one. I am not a  fan of it for reasons I will not get into, and because the mass merchant has sucked all the thrill out of it and all the other holidays with their price gouging. Anyways, I'll write again when I can. 

Adios"

"event","Now that I got that out of my system...this is what has gone on since my last post: First of all, I don't know how in the bloody...bloody hell anyone came up with the notion that I hitch-hiked home, lol, but it isn't true. I rode back in the same car with the same Marine as I rode down in. On the trip back we almost got stuck in Flagstaff, AZ because it was snowing so bad they had to close the highway, that we were taking back, home off. Since it was cold and there was snow there that neither of us saw on our visit home, we played in the snow a bit a took some stupid pictures of us doing so. We almost died because of how slippery the roads were, we very nearly slip into several semi's and other big scary road vehicles. We saw some guy on a motorcycle, and just from looking at him we felt his coldness...so very cold. Anyways, the weeks go by and nothing happens, then we start our training. We did some security details and patrols and checkpoints, blah blah blah all boring stuff. Then something great happend!!! I got selected to shoot the 50 Caliber machine gun...HELL YEAH!!! That is 13mm of pure, raw, fully automatic pain dealin'. Yeah buddy, that was fun...the Gunner even said for someone who never fired the thing, that I seemed to be a natural at it. Now I know how to take apart, put back together, trouble shoot, and then bring the pain to whoever messes with me or my hommies. I went to Tijuana...or Tijuanna, or however the hell it is spelled damnit!!! TJ, I went to TJ and got so drunk that I think I drank myself sober. I have heard of such things, but didn't think it possible...but I did it!!! The next day was great...slept allll day and loved every minute of it, the day after was yesterday and I didn't do much then either. Today I woke up late, I thought I was waking up on time, but things got all messed up and I was supposed to be one place at one time and another place at another time...anyways, I just got bitched out is all...then went to the place that I thought I was suppose to be in the first place for a Decontamination class and found out that it doesn't even run till tomorrow. So now I am here typing this nice long journal entry for you all to read :) BUT, I am going to watch a movie now...probably Butterfly Effect, that looks good. Hasta, and all my love to the Fam and my peeps. A Dios."

"event","X-mas was cool, spent some time with family and friends that I won't get to see again for probably at least a year. That night a female friend, that I knew back in highschool, came over. I knew her when she was in the sixth grade, and I think I was maybe a junior? I can't remember, I've slept since then. Anyways she is 18yrs old now. So anyways, we caught up on all that had happend in our lives up to this point, and discussed what each of us had planned in the near future...just the basic chit-chat you have when catching up. After our little conversation, we both crashed on the couch and watched Pirates of the Caribbean...we both fell asleep pretty much at the beginning. I woke up with her wrapped around me, and a crick in my neck, so I woke her up and suggested we move to the bed because it was more comfortable, there was more room...and I had a frickin crick in my neck. We both woke up pretty much at the same time, talked a bit more about last night, played for a bit, then decided to get up for the day. Needless to say I was not disappointed in the way things turned out and the best thing about it was neither of us got all strange with each other afterwards...meaning we both realized that there were no attachments. I will not divulge the name of this person so don't ask. New Years sucked royally, I was hoping to bring in the new year with some fireworks of my own...but some certain plans fell through and that never happend. What I ended up doing wasn't all that bad, which was getting drunk with some friends and generally having an alright time. We watched a couple of movies and played Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. I'm still pissed off though, partly from the fact that I have to go home sooner than expected and partly because of where I know I will be going soon. Oh well, such is life. My New Year's resolution? I didn't make one, but this should suffice: ""Don't fucking die."" good enough for me, hope it's good enough for everyone else cause that is all anyone is going to get. For those of you who don't like the ""F"" word....replace it with a bleet from a goat...it should sound a bit like: ""Don't *bbaaaahhhh* die"". Better? Anyways, Happy *bbaaahhh* New Year, may this one be better than the last."

This song most accurately describes what I am feeling at this point:

STONE SOUR - BOTHER

Wish I was too dead to cry 
My self affliction fades 
Stones to throw at my creator 
Masochists to which I cater 

You don't need to bother 
I don't need to be 
I'll keep slipping farther 
But once I hold on 
I won't let go 'till it bleeds 

Wish I was too dead to care 
If indeed I cared at all 
Never had a voice to protest 
So you fed me shit to digest 
I wish I had a reason 
My flaws are open season 
For this I gave up trying 
One good turn deserves my dying 

You don't need to bother 
I don't need to be 
I'll keep slipping farther 
But once I hold on 
I won't let go 'till it bleeds 

Wish I'd died instead of lived 
A zombie hides my face 
Shell forgotten with it's memories 
Diarys left with cryptic entries 
And you don't need to bother 
I don't need to be 
I'll keep slipping farther 
But once I hold on...I'll never live down my deceit."

So sit and watch me die in style...it will only take a little while.</i>


No, I'm not depressed...I'm actually overjoyed because I get to go home tomorrow!!! This is one of my old poems I just happen to stumble upon while cleaning out my secretary. It was scribbled on a crumbled piece of paper, which leads me to believe that I either wanted to throw it away cause I thought it sucked....or I had already written it down in my book. I looked in my book and it wasn't there, so I would assume the first conclusion...but as I read it, the poem didn't really seem to be all that bad. Hm, oh well...tell me what you think. Anyways, I have all my stuff pack...and I hear that we are going to be released tomorrow...so I should arrive at home sweet home some time Saturday. See all of you that will be there soon."

I am still going to Iraq, though I can't say where because it is classified and none of you have the access, clearance, or need to know (well...maybe the last one) for me to be able to release that info. But, rest assured...I am still going. I have already received my shots: Anthrax, Flu, Hepatitis, etc. that I will need to keep from getting sick over there...and they have already issued a warning order that we are going. The gear lists for what we will need have already been given, and we still have a full schedule of training. I know, I know, it sucks...but someone has to do it, and for some reason these bastards like to shoot at everyone but us...so we are going to pull their punk card and kick their arses out for good so that Iraq can rebuild and establish a good solid government so we can get the hell out of there. No worries though, I'll be home for this and next Christmas...so keep the turkey hot and the presents under the tree."

<i>""I've come undone and all hopes of mending<br>me are gone because the pain took my soul.<br>Can't you see? The only one who can put me<br>back together again is me.""</i>
The Rose Petals are associated with sorrow,<br>reflection, and wisdom. They are governed by<br>the goddess Persephone and their sign is The<br>Teardrop, or Broken Love.
As a Rose Petal, you are always self-reflective and<br>may be hard on yourself. You probably have<br>been hurt in the past by other people and can<br>sometimes distance yourself, as a result. You<br>don't usually let other get too close to you,<br>but you are very good at mending your spirits<br>back together by yourself.

Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek)<br>and Isis (Egyptian).
The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.
As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic<br>individual. You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times. While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

The downside is, now I have to stand duty...which is a 24 hour post...at the leasure of my NCO's. I'll take the good with the bad though, maybe after I get back from Iraq I'll pick up Corporal and be an NCO myself...who knows. We just got the warning order today that we are definately going over, but we are flying out instead of going out on ship, AND we are leaving early...like late February. The higher ups say we will be there about seven months, but if it is going to be anything like last time and no one is there to relieve us, then it will be longer. I'm unopinionated about going at this time, I'm certainly not scared, but in the same respect...I'm definately not happy. Someone has to go, so it might as well be us...after all we do have the reputation of kicking a lot of ass and taking as much names right? I expect to lose about thirty pounds while I am there, that is the average weight Marines lost last time they went out, on account of the heat and all the weight they were carrying around. Anyways, I'll keep everyone updated on what all is happening up until the point I leave...then there won't be any more posts until about...October to maybe as late as next December, depending on when we get back. We have a lot of training ahead of us up until then so I'll have interesting posts on all of what we did after the fact when that time comes."

I don't know, I just have people that are out for me...that don't like me...I pretty much expect to stay a four year PFC...dunno. I was out at CAX(Combined Armed eXcersize) was a bit drunk and was talking to another Marine about who we liked and didn't like and what not right? So anyways, I said that I didn't like a certain Sgt of mine cause he is ""always an ass to me"" exact words right there...then this pissant goes off and tells this very same Sgt that I said he was ""stupid, retarded, or deaf or something like that"". WTF?!?! So now the above mentioned Sgt has threatened to take all my weekends away up until we go on ship and that my pros & cons (what allows us to be promoted) will reflect this incident, thus ""promotions will not happen"" for me. But that wasn't the only thing that happened while I was out there at CAX...I found out that almost all of my stuff was stolen (ie: Playstation2, Gamecube, and all the games and dvds that were worth a damn was stolen out of my room whilst me and my room mate as the advanced party were out in 29 Palms getting things ready for people to come up there the following week, I also was used as a human punching bag for some drunk Marines (that is until I started clocking them over the head with my cott pole :P) I was also sunburned, wind burned, rained on, and lets not forget the freezing nights and mornings etc. This is the Mohave Dessert we are talking about after all, I suppose these things were to be suspected, and they were...but I still hated it none the less. We may be leaving to go to Iraq...or at least in that region...sooner than we had anticipated. At first we were going on float...on a boat for six months, now I here something about Feb or March and instead of boating we may be flying. Dunno for sure yet though.

Anyways, since i posted last I got a football injury in my knee...a miniscus tear or something like that...and I finished a 9 mile hike that I didn't think I was going to make...this was before the injury. I got some contacts too, I got tired of wearing these dorky Navy glasses. Anyways...yeah..."

Beforehand, we would get off of work...usually no later than 4pm, BUT we were doing this stupid inventory of every single frickin thing in our comm shop. We have had to not only stay later, but also show up earlier this week...less sleep makes a very grumpy me. I'm in a pretty shitty mood anyways cause I stopped taking my meds...I stopped taking them cause I hate having to take something just to feel human. I will probably end up taking them again soon, because I am beggining to realize that maybe I really do need them. ick...whatever...nothing is going on."

"event","Yeah I know, I was supposed to go to Tijuana...but my friends decided to leave without me while I was doing a favor for a friend. Pretty crummy right? Oh well, I put a curse of a thousand boils on each of their asses...so we'll see whose laughing soon enough. But eh, I saw two really good movies today...one, of course, being Freddy vs. Jason (I don't care who says what...Freddy laid the smack down on Jason hands down) and the other movie was a pretty cool little ""skaters trying to make it big"" flick called The Grind. Other than that I haven't really done much this weekend except place 4th in a laser tag tournament I decided to go to at random. I got 4th for several reasons...I had to trade my equipment in cause it died on me almost at the beginning of the game, my team mate decided he didn't want to play at about the middle of the game, and the other team not only outnumbered us...but they were doing some mad cheating too. But four out of seven isn't bad under all those circumstances I don't think."

"event","Sick In Quarters, yup...that is what I have been pretty much all day. Tomorrow I get off all this crazy medication hopefully....well tomorrow is when I go back to BAS for my check up. Today I was supposed to go see the President, but I heard the whole thing was boring anyways. Apparently everyone had to stand in formation for about three hours listening to bands play and special guests sing (who happend to be country music artists at that)...then, Mr. Bush landed in Air Force One, made about a 20min speech about the war on terrorism and it not being over...then left. Meanwhile...I was passed out in a drugged up haze, not knowing what was going on pretty much all day long. After I woke up, everyone was off of work and starting to field day. Field day is the day that everyone cleans their rooms and such. I'm done with my side of the room already, but because I am on the computer...I'm getting messed with by my superiors. Oh well, such is life right? I've never failed a field day in my life, so I don't know what they are tripping about anyways."

"event","Today went by quickly because I was in a drugged up haze throughout most the day. I've been experiencing the same dizziness...constant now, but milder...cold sweats...grogginess...and very drowsy. I've been told it was hot out today, but I was freezing most the day personally. I don't know if I have come down with something, or it's all the meds hitting me so hard. It doesn't help that every single one of them have a label reading ""may cause drowsiness"". Tomorrow I get to meet the President of the United States, George W. Bush...He will be here for some reason or another, I'm not really sure...I was just picked to go to the ceremony, speech, gathering, whatever it is I was picked pretty much at the last minute. Hopefully I will be feeling better, don't want to pass out during the event, though...I'm sure the President would probably remember me if I did. Anyways, after the event...I have to go back to BAS and find out what else is wrong with me now, and see if whatever I had is cured now and how to cure me of whatever I have now....ick...we'll see how that goes. We did our weigh in today, and just like I told everyone, I am about 20lbs under my max weight. I did find out that I am about 3lbs over my ideal weight though....and in all actuallity I can get down to about 110lbs and still be considered healthy...but I'm not sure I want to get down that low. Anyways, whatever...I will write later to update my info...."

"event","Today went by fairly quickly...we didn't do much and I was in a drugged up haze most the day anyways. I went on a run after work, but it was in boots and utes (camie bottoms, boots, and our green undershirt) and it was the hottest part of the day, so I only ran about a mile and a half instead of the whole 3 mile track. I think I may be sick and not know it because I was getting cold spells during the run and was sweating for about an hour solid afterwards....and of course I was dizzy....and dehydrated....ick. The week is almost halfway over...which is good, I'm ready for the weekend again. Anyways...I'm tired, really tired so I think I am going to turn in early tonight, hopefully I will be well rested and feeling better by tomorrow."

"event","This morning started out with a 5 mile run, which actually wasn't that bad because I was so zonked out I didn't notice that my muscles ached and my lungs hurt. After the run, I rested up a bit, showered...then headed over to BAS to have my little ailement check out to see what exactly is going on. I sat there for a good hour, because they couldn't find our records and had to look for them, after that...I sat there longer and watched some guy get his ingrown toenail taken out. Also in the medical center was some guy that had what looked like a scaffold on his leg...the leg itself looked as if it had been put through a grinder...the same with his arm...save the little contraption. Finally I got called into a room and they asked me all the questions they had already asked me twice already then left me to sit there until the doc was free. Doc came in and the first thing he did was...once again, ask me all the same questions that I had now heard and answered thrice in a row. Anyways, he gets to looking inside my ears and found some scar tissue and what appeared to be some fluid behind the ear drum. He said that would probably explain why I was getting dizzy and stumbling all over the place like a drunken moneky with clown shoes on. He perscribed me some pills and a nasal inhaler (the inhaler I have to wait to get cause it wasn't in) to hopefully dry up and get rid of the fluid and make me balanced again. This is now about four medications I will have to be taking daily....I am really pissed off about this cause I am tired of having to take meds just to feel like a normal person and function in everyday life....and if I forget to take the stupid things...all hell breaks loose and I am not what people would consider.....in my right mind. *sigh* oh well...such is life I guess...I will just have to live with being a living zombie for awhile until some of these things clear up so I can get off at least a few of these things. Anyways, besides all that, we got off really early today, which is great, so now that I am all drugged up like a laboratory animal...I think I will take a long nap and see what that does for me....."

On this planet there are various lifeforms of all different shapes and sizes, travelling amid the endless roads in pairs...always in pairs. Two poles of opposite force negative, positive, male, female. So anyways, I was talking to this girl online last night....rather early this morning online. We seemed to hit it off well enough just chatting and then I gave her my phone number. The two of us talked for what seemed to be hours, both of us in this state of being not asleep, but not really all that awake either. We talked about nothing pretty much, just the normal pleasentries when getting to know someone...but for that moment I feel as though I found a lifelong friend of whom I hadn't talked to in years. The way she talked to me was as if she knew me or had known me for so long that she was comfortable with the sound of my voice. As we talked the sun rose and we both were touched by the sandman and started to feel sleeps lovely kiss on our heads...drifting into a dreamlike state...still on the phone. Knowing that the conversation would either end or trail off eventually if it continued this way, I decided to end it and asked her to call me back later on when she awoke..."

"event","Today's little 4 mile run wasn't shit, I thought I was going to die before I even started the run...but it was cake and pie. Still have that dizzy thing going on, so I went to medical today to see what was wrong with me. All they told me was to drink more water, take it easy this weekend...and to come in monday if I'm still getting dizzy for no reason. Stupid corpsman...they are lifesavers out in the field and in war...but back at home they aren't worth a damn. We didn't do much of anything at work today, just charged some batteries...cleaned up the place..and loaned some gear out to the scout sniper guys. We were released for the weekend around 1:30 to 2:00 somewhere around there. I was going to go out and do something, but I am too damn dizzy to move around too much...ick. I'm just going to chat on the net all night and maybe play some diablo...OFFLINE, cause I can't get it to connect to bnet!!! grrrrrrr. I also need my dvd burner so I can watch/copy dvds, but my brother is taking his good sweet-ass time about getting it to me."

"event","I just started this thing today. I think I did it as a form of self therapy...so I can keep what is left of my sanity intact by having an outlet. Today was a slow day, we set up our radios to have them communicate and they didn't work. Well, that isn't exactly true...mine worked cause I'm the shit...I could call out and receive comm, but everyone else couldn't get through due to some problems on their end. I need to go to BAS (Battalion Aid Station) because I have been having these strange dizzy spells for no apparent reason whatsoever. I thought it could be dehydration, but if that be the case...with as much water as I have consumed today, the symptoms should have subsided. I've been eating fine so that can't be it...and I have cut down on my smoking considerably. I don't know, I'll have it checked out tomorrow after our 5 mile run that I don't want to do. On that note, there isn't much more to pour out today, I am going to bed now."

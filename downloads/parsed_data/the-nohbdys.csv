"event","Wow, it's been a while since I posted something on here.

The News: 
Well, there's so much to catch you up on, it seems almost pointless to even try.

Hmm...I'll start with the news happening now and work my way back.

1) I bought Sims 2 for GameCube the other day, lemmie just say: ""WHAT THE FUCKING HELL!?!?!?"" Just to get your sim you have to play the Vegas slot machines. And, and, AND, it seems they took all their Sims rejects and placed them in the game. Half of the males have tiny Michael Jackson noses, tiny squinty eyes, and what appear to be the result of many generations of inbreeding: they're jaws are HUGE!! Game play sucks, too. The whole point of the game (Freemode) is to unlock everything, just like in Storymode, but when everything's all unlocked...What next? Huh? What? 
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the PC version of Sims 2 and their expansion packs, but...I don't like the Gamecube version...I'm used to having more control over everything. In the PC version it's more like becomming God than in the GC version. I like being God. God is mean. I am mean. I am God.

2) I'm going to Pennsylvania. I went to Wisconsin. Yadda-ya, we don't care. Let's move on.

3) AFI came out with a new CD. Decemberunderground. Their 7th full-length CD, if you don't already know all the songs by heart, which I'm not admitting to,  GO BUY THE DAMN CD!! LEARN THE DAMN SONGS!! You will NOT be let down. It's another masterpiece by the Gods. And we pray for more. -praying goes here-

4) I broke up with my girlfriend, Vanessa. After 8 long months of being together, we had a serious fall out. My side of the story mainly consisted of figuring out that she was more in love with Rena than me. I thought I trully loved her. But that's how it always ends; they call you the cold, heartless one, when really it's them...
Not a day goes by when I question our kisses. What did they mean? Passion? Love? Deciet? Lies? She was always the shy one...Maybe she was just using me to get to Rena. To make her realize that she, my girlfriend, was madly in love with a manipulative bitch. 
I don't want her back, never, ever. But when I really get to thinking about it...I can't help but want to feel her lips one last time. Then leave her there for good. Leave her and our memories behind.  

5) I got my hair cut!! (Told you I was going back in time)
It's gone from long and blah to JADE-ette. Ya' know. Jade. AFI, previously mentioned. The shmexy guitarist. Yeah, only, mines shorter and disobedient. Then mom had to go off and fuck it all up by giving me this really shitty ""Leonardo DeCrapriho"" look from the Titanic. Luckily, it was the back of my head and it's grown out some. I still hate it, but I wont let her touch it. Ever. Again.
Never trust an ex-brewery worker turned nurse when she says she ""will do a good job.""
I thought I was scared of mom using scissors before -whistle- I was in for a treat. I thought she was going to ""accidentally"" miss and slice my neck in half. (Unlogical, but it could happen in some freak-accident-thingy!)

6) Jeshire was living with us for a while, then shit went down and she's back in Texas. I'm sending her the AFI CD you should have already bought by now. Freaks.

7) I've discovered how uneventful summer is without summerschool. I've had so much freetime that I've found out who all plays my favorite parts in Starship Troopers (1st movie) and a little about them and other things their doing.
 
A) Colonel Carl Jenkins: Neil Patrick Harris. Shmexy bitch. Plays Barney in ""How I Met Your Mother""

B) Private Ace Levy: Jake Busey. Shmexy bitch. Plays Kyle in ""Tom Cats""

C) Sargeant Charlie Zim: Clancy Brown. DOB: January 5th, '59. He's a year younger than my mom and his birthday is the day before mine, just like Brian Warner's. Tis cool. He does the voice-over of Mr. Krabs on Spongebob Squarepants. Will also be appearing in ""The Guardian"" with Ashton Kutcher.

D) Private/Sargeant/Lieutenant Juan ""Johnny"" Rico: Casper van Dein. He's a year older than Mr. Warner. DOB: December 18th, '68.

Yep, told you I have/had WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to much time on my hands. What I really should have been doing was....-shrug- Look up maps of the high school? .........Hey, could I do that? That'd be hella awsome!



Well, that's all I'm going to update you with right now...Because that's pretty much all I can remember right now.

Milla Jovovich is working on Resident Evil: Extinction/Afterlife/3. Yeah....I'll go now.....AND I'M TAKING MY NERDYNESS WITH ME!!! YOU NERD HATERS!!!












FREAKS!!!"

"event","Okay, so, our computer got this virus a month or so back, we took it into Best Buy to get it fixed. Well, they had to put in a new hard drive. Whoopie.
They put it in and it was a whole different computer. Not the nice new one that worked perfectly fucking well...It was different. Didn't run as smoothly. Had different buttons. Can't support any of our games.
Oh! Speaking of games...I put my Sims 2 games on there, the first two, couldn't find the code for Nightlife so I bought Open for Business...Thought it'd be GREAT. Instead, I found out that the computer fucks with the game.
The whole screen turns blue. Sky blue. Except around the sims and whatever you highlight.
GREAT. Just fucking GREAT. Right?
Well, I download all the patches, they fix NOTHING. Absolutely NOTHING. 
This new and ""better"" (bullshit) hard drive devours happiness and whatnot...I haven't the guts to put in Still Life and play that again, nor will I put in Indigo Prophecy...For fear that something else will happen.
Such as slowling down to a slugs pace. Literally. It takes in hour to move the coursor...Like in The Movies. A fucking great hard drive, STEVE..or whatever your name was Mr. I-Work-At-Best-Buy-And-Not-Really-Fix-People's-Computer-Problems guy....I think his name was Nick...Or Nik...Something like that...
FUCK BEST BUY AND THEIR TECH SUPPORT!!!!
AND...STUFF!!!"

Why the fuck can't Rena get her own personal interests???
Yeah, I'm interested in Psychology, about how the human mind works; serial killers: why they became what they became; band members: why they think/act that way, do that stuff, y'know, stuff like that. (Wow...I sound sooooo professional there...)
I want a fucking life. I want my own interests to belong to me. And so forth.
She is OKAY sometimes, SOMETIMES. Other times, I could lunge at her with my bare hands and pull her uterus and intestines through her bellybutton. FUCKING HATE HER RIGHT NOW!!!

"event","How can Rena do this? She can be so cruel to one person and hurt the others around her as well.
She broke up with Jess because she ""still has feelings for Suresha.""
It hurt me when she told me, especially infront of Vanessa.
Why? Because:

Rena, just because you still have feelings for the first person doesn't mean that you have to break the second one's heart.
And I know that I'm almost doing the same thing. I still have feelings for Steven, but I'm not going to break-up with Vanessa because of them.
As least you still HAVE a chance with either one of them!!
I NEVER had a chance. I NEVER WILL.
Do you know how much it hurts when you have a crush on someone but when they look at you, they see nothing?
When I'm with Vanessa, I try not to think about him because it kills me everytime.
It kills me because I know that he never liked me.
It kills me because I know that I still like him.
It kills me because I'm with my girlfriend when I think about him.
Whenever I, or anyone else, say his name it's like a stab to the heart.
Like Vanessa's stabing my heart for thinking about him or saying his name, it's a punishment.
But of course, no one will trully understand the way I feel, because I talked so much about him before.
I'm the boy who cried wolf.

When a broken heart finds a way to love again, it's hard for it to forget the person who inspired such a thing.
That's why I just CAN'T forget about him, no matter how hard I try, he'll never go away.

When he came back to the school for a visit with some teachers, when he walked by, I looked so calm and uncaring...But on the inside...I was breaking and falling apart. Deing. I'm slowly deing whenever I see him or utter his name...When I think of him, I die just a little bit more...

I actually want to die rather than see him again.
That's how much I like/liked him."

"event","Gahh! Why wont dad just go into his room and STAY there!?
It's making me fucking nervous as hell. He just paces between his room and the kitchen, pausing to hover over me.
Just go away! 
I don't really care if mum called you and told you that I have an F in History or that I still have yet to turn in my 110 point History project!
I don't care!
Just go away!
Go into your room and STAY there!
I don't need this kind of nervousness after I basically just woke up. Tis not really on my high priority list.
Hmm...I wonder if he does know about the whole History thing.....
And he's just keeping a close eye on me....
I get enough of that at school just because I wear black, Kay, hon?
It's too close of an eye...Also doesn't help that he's an ex-cop....And my step-dad's an ex-military cop....
People are always watching me too closely.
Just let me be, I can assure you that I wont go and get into trouble unless I was really pissed off and/or looking for revenge."

"event","So... I got back from church camp.  All I have to say is ""friggen amazing.""  I'd never expect in a million years that I would have became a christian, but hey.  I had the best time, I loved the awsome games, I got to pla moses in a skit and was named ""EMOses"" nice.  I got closer to Christian(with the big mokawk), megan, jenny, sara, and I made my new best friend, Sal.  I swear Sal is my long lost brother, I love that dude, he lives in NY.  My mom and I are going to drive up there before school starts and star with him for a week or so.  I also met his girlfriend Alex and her best friend Brittney.  When I got there we had these services and the band that played was banging, dude.  Then Wednessday night, I felt so comfortable with Sal and Megan, I broke down when everyone went up the the from and prayed and confessed and such.  Everytime something like that happend, Sal was there for me, as I was for him.  Thursday night, I was saved.  Then Friday night, the last night, we were told to find someone that we felt close to or had a burden with, and wash their feet.  Of course me and Sal did it, then we walked around the campus and talked.  He and I are like, exactly equal, same bands, same tastes.  That is one rad dude.  I was so upset to leave, I gave Sal my bandanna.  I can't wait to go see him.  Well, today I got up with Sammy and went to church, then went to the movies with Sam, Christian, David, Katy, Ryan, and Megano.  After that and youth group, I came home and chilled.  I have to leave tuesday morning to go to ohio until next Tuesday, fun.  I don't want to work tomorrow.  Everyone should come visit me, I'll be at the game stand.  Well it's bed time for sir roberto, goodevening."

Then some girls got naked on my surfboard, everyone was shady's (sams brother) friends.  So today I woke up with a bit of a hang over.  Erica and sara came over so sam could get his mack on.  Then I came home and slept.  I called Chris and asked what he was up to, we ended up seeing a movie.  We saw ""Sleepover"" I don't know why.  Then after the movie, this black dude got arrested for beating up some 8th graders who had a <b>gun</b>.  I would like to know... WHY DO 8TH GRADERS HAVE GUNS?!?!  I felt badass when I got a lighter and a rock.  Christ.  I don't have to work untill Wednessday so I've been partying non-stop, and it's starting to hit me.

Woke up and got ready for work.  I had to work at the ping pong stand, blew.  Me and Remmy (co worker) only got like 5 sales.  I went to youth group and hung out with Megan the whole time.

Then Danielle called and asked if I wanted to go to take her friend home with her.  eh'.  Wanted to and yet not.  I went.

Then I got some <b>Compact Disks</b>.  I got Bright Eyes, Autopilot Off, and a Ferret Records compalation.  Then we went and saw ""Day after tomorrow"" I'm not afraid that the world is ending.  That movie deffinitally rocked my socks.  So now I have to go to bed.  Goodevening."

Lauren helped me throughout 1st and 2nd period, then I skiped with her and went to 5th period lunch so I was good by then.  Man, I don't remember much.  I don't really care anymore, why should I be sober, honestly.  I want a ciggerette so bad because everyone I know has them and I haven't in so long.  I keep needing <b>some</b> relief.  Yesterday was some, even though I had to work.  I met Brittney at the mall around noon and we walked around.  Then we went and saw ""Soul Plane"" that movie = awsome to the max.  Brittney's a cool girl and I do believe I'm fond of her.  That was mostly my highlight of the day.  I'm online trying to find a wetsuit for the surf comp. in VA beach in a few weeks.  Tis going to rule all.  Well I made $70 tonight at work, so I = happy/unpoor.  I like this Amberlin CD I'm listening to though, I truly do.  Well I'm going to continue. PTFO"

So my mom was picking me up and taking me to lunch during 5th period.  We went to the mall and I was buying plugs for my lip at the ear ring place in front of cinabons called ""Made for you"" and I asked the guy if he was hiring.  His exact words were ""Yea, can you start tonight?""  I told him I could tomorrow.  He also owns the kiosk stand next to the elevator with the ping pong thing, that is where I start for hte first 2 weeks.  The pay is awsome, I get 15% of what I sell for hte first week.  Then depending on how much I sell in that time determines my official salary + 7% of what I sell.  YAY.  The job requires little work, which I like.  Everyone should come by and say hi to me when they get the chance.  I work... Thursday 3-930, Saturday 7-5, Sunday 11-5, Monday & Tuesday 3-930.

I do beleive things are hopefully going places, we just need to spend more time together (of course thats what left me single).  I need to talk to her, hopefully tomorrow we can.  Between the band, and school, I = no time, but I'm deffenitaly pushing alot of that aside, I don't do anything at school anyway.  I really want things to work out.  I've made somewhat of a new friend, jamie.  The guy who used to hate me, but he's one swell fellow.

"event","Yesterday was long, but fun.  I got up and layed around the house for a bit.  Then I finally took a shower and went up to the mall for a little bit.  I little sammy up there with his ladies.  He walked around with me for a while.  Then I went down to the theater to meet sammy to see ""Mean Girls""  It was a decent movie, I enjoyed it.  Then we had some time to spare and we needed mothersday gifts so we headed over to the mall.  We couldn't think of anything to get, and the line for card stores were like 30 people so that was out of the question.  We are to cool for lines.  Sam went and got her mother a book.  I found nothing so I made a card and wrote a poem.  It got to be like 9 and we were eating and sam remebered that travis was supposed to bring her pizza so she tried to contact him.  We went down to the movies because her brother was there.   We ended up staying for another movie. ""New York Minute""  That as well was not a bad movie.  There was no one in the theater until right as the movie started, it would have been alot cooler if the theater was fully empty.  Afterwards, my step-dad gave sam a ride home.  Very fun night, very fun company &hearts;.  well today I'm bored and have to much of a sun burn to go outside, so I'm just going to enjoy my day of tv.  FUN.  Tomorrow I'm not looking forward to school.  PTFO, <3."

"event","<b>last night</b>
I watched the final episode of friends, sad sad.  Then I went outside because I heard either alexs', or mikes car.  I came out and found 32 cones in my front yard.  Bastards, I'll get them back.  figuring that all of the cones stay in RK's backyard, I'm sure he had something to do with it.  Then I came upstairs and played on the computer for a while and slept.  

<b>Today</b>
I stayed home yet again from school, I did feel alot better though.  I ended up mowning the lawn from like 11:30 until 4:00.  Then my step-dad and I took my mom out for mothersday (he has to work sunday).  I, by the way, got very very very bad sunburn.  I went to my brothers place with it, such pain.  We met this band from Fredricks called ""fly or die"" excelent band, cool guys.  We hung out with them the entire night.  Then sammy and lindsey and juliane had to leave so it was just me and mike and doug (the drummer and bassist).  We talked until about 12 and then they gave me a ride home.  Fun night.  Then I got home and found out some really nice news <3.  Now I'm sitting here putting some lotion stuff on my horrific sunburn.  my entire back burns so friggen bad.  Well I'm going to sleep so this pain ends for now (emo line).  I'm getting up early to help for a yardsale and then to the mall.  <3"

We went up to the mall because I had a meeting with my boss at 4:30.  We went to hot topic for a little while, scott bought some flesh tubes and I, being on short budget, went over to the sale rack.  I found a cool beanie and a patch for S&hearts;mmy.  strait XXX edge.  truly nice, so bought that and scott and I still had like an hour to waste.  We went to pocket change to do some dancing.  Then time sped up and I had my meeting.  I can't have any piercings at Chick-Fil-A so I kind of have to quit.  Plus I'm not cutting my hair for any reason and I would have to in order to continue my work there.  This means that Bert has to cut costs for the weekends and cut back on going out places. This also means I have to find a job fast, parents do not pay an allowence.  I'm thinking about Red Lobser or GNC, could be fun.  Well I'm going outside to skate for a tid bit."

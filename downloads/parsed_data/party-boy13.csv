"event","last night was the party. it was cool but people just kept showing up and showing up and showing up. i didnt even know like half of the people that were in my house, but thats usally how it goes when you say you got a open house. at first we had like no alki but at 12 me bill and lacy made a run and got some...i never seen so many people throw up in my life. then i woke up at like 7 and started cleaning the house. i got it like 10 times as clean as it was before my parents left. lol thats how my mom knew i had a party oh and the broken bottle that i missed in the garage. but thanks to everyone who came that i knew and thanks to everyone who helped out with drunk people.

tonight i went to mitches with rob bill alissa and laura and played poker. it was me rob bill mitch and brian. once we got mitch and bill out we just cashed out. i had the most chips then rob then brian. went to baldo's and bill mitch and brian got some food. now im going to bed.

"event","today my brother's girlfriend woke me up askin me where my mom was because my brother got in a car accident and totaled his civic. he was goin home from work and hit a bump in a road right before he was gettin ready to exit the freeway, and the bump shot him across the freeway and he smashed into the center median at 80 mph. so i had to drive down to his apartment in sac and drive him to the hospital to check out his knee. he didnt have any real damage to it just bruised it pretty bad and his hand was a little bruised from smashing the windsheild with it. im glad cuz he is alright...we still dont really know how he is still here. if he didnt have his seatbelt on he woulda been gone. and im kinda pissed cause im hella nice and let have my car for a week so he can still go to work and school. so this whole week im prix less, oh and phoneless, but i think its gettin turned back on tomorrow so if anyone wants to do anything give me a call."

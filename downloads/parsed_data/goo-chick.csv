"event","Well I just got word that President Bush will remain the president for the next four years. I'm not that interested in all this voting stuff, actually i'm not even registered. But watching the TV last night and waiting for all the states to turn red or blue I started to get nervous. Now I don't really like either of the candidates that were running for president, but I would like to have Bush rather that Kerry. Kerry just looks like a spook. But I do think it was cool for Kerry to quit counting votes in Ohio and just realize that he lost. It takes a cool guy to call his opponent like that. I'm glad Bush won, he has done some good things for this country, despite popular belief. Now I know everyone is all upset about this war and shit but seriously do you not remember what those fuckers did to us? I don't care what country we are fighting in, we NEED to get rid of the fucking terrorists or else they are going to be coming over here and taking care of us. It was a hard decision for him to make, but it was the right one. I know it sucks having all of the troops over there getting killed, but that is what they signed up for. They want to be over there protecting their country. Some I've talked to can't wait to get over there. Seriously we need to be having this war, it's a sacrifice that needs to happen. This country wouldn't be the way it is if we wouldn't have fought for it, and that's just what we're doing now.....now i'm starting to sound like I actually like politics, maybe I do, maybe I'll decide to vote next time.....we'll see what happens. So besides that I don't have my writing class today so that's cool, gonna come back to my room and take a little nap. Tomorrow I get to go home for the weekend (no class on Friday) and see my family and Troy. I have to make Troy an anniversary supper, he's picking whatever he wants, and I have to make it. Hopefully I will know how to make it. haha. Plus I like being able to drive my truck. I never even get to see my truck during the week cuz it's parked in Egypt and that's almost a mile from my building. It's a Dodge, what can I say. If you drove one you'd understand. Well I have to head to choir, talk at ya later."

"event","So i'm sitting here at the computer, watching Full House (yea I know), and talking to Troy on the phone. I'm waiting for Trista to wake up so we can go eat cuz i'm STARVING!!! We probably won't eat until after Choir, which is cool cuz then I can go to the lower gag and get a grilled cheese!!!! WOO HOO! I really didn't do anything fun for Halloween.... I dressed up as a redneck, which wasn't too hard seeing as I already am one, and gave out candy at my house with Troy. I worked at the haunted house the other night which was fun, but it made me realize how dumb some parents are. If I had a dollar for every 10 year old group of girls that came through crying without a parent I would be rich. Seriously, who drops off their 10 year old kid off by themselves at a haunted house, they must be morons. I don't really have anything else to say right now cuz it's too early in the morning but maybe I'll have something later. Talk at ya later. I LOVE YOU TROY!!!"

"event","Well it has been awhile since I updated and I'm sitting in the library, refusing to do homework, and needed to find something to do. So I decided that I would update my journal. I have been up here at college for a little over a month now and I have to tell ya, it ain't all it's cracked up to be. Honestly it's just the same as high school, cept in a different place. I've made some friends, mostly the girls that live on my floor in the dorm, and yesturday I even let my SRA cut my hair. How crazy is that?? I have been to 2 parties, but I thought they were dumb and left when everybody started drinking, but whatever.....let them have their fun if they want. The only thing I do, besides go to class, is watch TLC, MTV, ABCFamily, or do my homework, and talk to Troy. It's like I just find things to do until I can go home on the weekend. And I do, EVERY weekend. I go back so that I can visit my boyfriend Troy, who now lives with me at my house :), and try to find stuff to do with him. I think my hair turned out ok, although it was a very traumatic experience and my mom is prolly gonna kick my ass when she sees it. I think it's pretty cute, and so do a bunch of other people. Especially Trista who thinks I look like Ashlee Simpson, which I haven't decided is a good or bad thing. This is my third visit to the library, and my first time actullay doing something related to school. Otherwise it was to come see Brent while he was working or hide from Trista immence that large stacks of books. I should probably start actually writing my 3 page paper that is due tomorrow so I'm gonna get that done so I can go home ASAP after my class tomorrow. Well that is all I have for today kids, tune in next time to discuss the rise and fall of the human race........."

"event","Well I am now a college girl. Up here at Wayne State. Trista's up here too. I was kinda bored and wanted something to do that wasn't homework and decided to update my journal. So what's been going on in my life? Well I have a boyfriend. His name is Troy. I love him so much. He is totally the love of my life. I think he's the one, seriously.......I'm not even close to joking. If you'd like to be a part of my wedding party just let me know. ;) Well hopefully I'll have something to say some other time. I've been sick for the past week so i haven't really done anything at all. Holler at your Home Slices."

"event","I didn't really feel like writing yesturday, it had to have been the worst day of my life! Well I woke up late for school, which isn't too bad, but ya know. Then in my Biology class I had to dissect a fetal pig. It was so gross. He just tossed this dead body in a bag onto our tray and we were just suppose to have at it and find all of it's internal and external organs. I almost died. I tried to get out of it. I told him that I was a vegetarian and he's like ok well then don't eat it. And I said well i'm in PETA and I'm a animal rights activist, and he's all well it was already dead, just do it. I also tried to tell him I was Zhen Buddist, but by this time he was obviously sick of listening to me speak so I just watched my partner do it and checked of the organs on our sheet. Then after that I drove up to Whiting to see Heather, Joe, and maybe Ian. But Ian left for work so me and Heather did our usual girl chat before just having fun. Then we went to Onawa and ate at McDonalds. Then we went back home and sat around for while. Then we went back up and ate at McDonald's again. Then after sitting around some more we had to go buy Heather some cigarettes at the store. Then i started to feel sick so I came home and did my homework. I also got into it with my mother about how I can't wait until I move out. She was all pissed cuz I came home and she told me I was grounded and I laughed at her and told her I was a little to old to be getting grounded. Then we just started to scream at each other and I said I can't wait until I move out and she left. Then she came back and asked if I really wanted to move out and I said yes. Then she had the nerve to ask me why. CUZ SHE DRIVES ME FUCKING NUTS!!!!! Then I went to bed. Today I had school again, but I have the day off tomorrow. Well not really, I don't have school, but I got to go up to college and register for next years classes. My mom keeps calling and asking if all of my stuff is packed yet, she really pisses me off. Then I work on Saturday. hmm not to exciting but what the hell did you expect?  I gotta run to the city for some stuff, see ya'll later."

"event","It's been awhile since I've written. Partly because of some shit that happened at school and something about a mental institution or something. Just trust me when I say that it wasn't very good, not good at all. But now school is over and no one can tell me what to do anymore! Shit, Piss, Fuck, Damn, and all that jazz. God it's great to finally be able to write about shit again. I am currently a student at Wit and I have classes from 8:00am-9:20am (college algebra), and from 10:30am-12:30pm (Introduction to Biology). I got a 99% on my Algebra test, so I'm pretty ecstatic about that seeing as I didn't even get CLOSE to that on any of my high school algebra tests. It was Trista's birthday on the 10th. That youngin' finally turned 18 and got to partake in the adult rituals which included, but was not limited to, buying cigarettes and going to the adult stores. I think Trista will be the most excited that I started up my journal again because the only thing she ever did was write in hers and read mine. I have to dissect baby pigs on Wednesday, not looking forward to that at all. Um Trista, Heather, Joey, Ian, and I all went camping the other night, it was wicked crazy. I LOVE PADDLE-BOATS!!! Well I think that's about all I have for now, talk at ya later."

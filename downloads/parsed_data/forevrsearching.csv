"event","well this is my very first entry and may also be my last.  i have been very undecisive if i wanted to use this sytem or not.  well i decided i would.  to get things started i thought i may share two of my best peoms i have written but before i do some explanation about them is in order.  with my first on it's all about my shity past and how my asshole of a stepfather decided to knock the shit out of me.  well here it is ................................

Darkness
It's all around
and is easy to be found
it consumes your soul, or lack thereof
and sends you into a land far from above
with a knife it could all end
an eternity of heel i will spend
to kill the pain of eternal desire
will douse the flame of eternal fire
darkness is all around
darkness is the deafening sound
darkness is the last cry for help
when no one can hear you scream or yelp
darkness is the final thought
is my life worth be bought
your capture says no, and raises the gun up high
and says to you say your final goodbye
you ask and ask and wonder why
but he says you are the one to die
you ask him whyyou deserve this
he says, ""it's a public service""
you ask if it's cause you've hardly ever been bad
he says don't you knoe me i'm your old step dad
why oh why are you so crazy
i don't know but the room is going hazy
he pulls the trigger, and you fall to the floor
and puts the gun to himslef, there goes one more.

so there is one of them now the other is alot more desturbing and this one was written on one of my most darkest days..................

KILL ME
take the final step to end it all
help me not fear the forever fall
take me from this hellish place
make it so i won't ever see another face
make me go the extra mile
that makes death so worth while
make them learn from it's mistake
and let them know this isn't fake
kill me now to stop the pain
help me die in vain
kill me now cause it'll happen no matter what
this will be the last time i'm called a mut
take my pain away so i can feel peace
please don't make me sign a lease
you pushed mea little to far
what do i do now when i'm in my car
to night it'll happen when no ones around
i promise it'll all go down and i won't be found.

Well i said they weren't happy but they are what i felt and still feel that way.  so here is the final one i will write because i don't now how you will all react so here is my last one............
TEARS
i cry and cry and never stop
it feels as though i'm gonna pop
i cry so much it's if my tears are made of blood
i can't stop and it seems like there is a flood
i cut my wrist to stop the pain
but i can't ever hit a good vein
i try so many other ways but to no avail
i wish i could just run to hell
to be depressed is to choose a fait
from this you become your own live bait
you now it's true
when you sufficate till your a bright blue
tears fall like rain drops
one after another until the last one pops
to cry and cry forever is really bad
ecspecially when your beaten by your step-dad


well...............sorrry for my novel i just had to try this out once and now i'm probably done but i may not.

and now i and still foreverlost...............................................................Dott"

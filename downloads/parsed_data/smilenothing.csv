The summer nights are long and warm so we head off to hit the town
Hold on to my hand
We'll parade down the promenade pass the bottle back and forth
Whisper in my ear
As we dance and drink at every bar laughing falling arm in arm
You look beautiful tonight
And your words make me embarrassed of all my misgivings

Don't kiss me goodnight
Don't kiss me goodnight
Let's greet the new day
Don't kiss me goodnight
Don't kiss me goodnight
I'm wishing I could stay

Uncork the last bottle
Crank up the vinyl
We'll drive the neighbors wild
Sing me a sad song on the fire escape
While the sun threatens the night sky
6 am? Let's go downstairs and buy ourselves one final round
And when I do sleep please god let me
Awaken with the feeling of conviction I have tonight

All I could want would be a life where I loved you and only you
And not be plagued with misgivings
A life where I knew the words we spoke were true
But I have no faith and I'm condemned
To sleepless nights and awkward misjudgements

xx //

<small>Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darlin' you give love, a bad name

Fuck you

An angel's smile is what you sell
you promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
when passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa!
You're a loaded gun
yeah, whoa...
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

You paint that smile on your lips
blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Whoa!
You're a loaded gun
whoa...
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love...

Shot through the heart
and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name

Shot through the heart
and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

probably with a great love for Fantasy or Science<br>Fiction. You're very creative

creative that you can use that vast imagination of<br>yours. You're a bit of a

"event","biting keeps your words at bay
tending to the sores that stay
happiness is just a gash away
when i open a familiar scar
pain goes shooting like a star
comfort hasn't failed to follow so far...

and you might say it's self-indulgent
you might say its self-destructive
but, you see, it's more productive
than if i were to be healthy

& pens and penknives take the blame
crane my neck & scratch my name
but the ugly marks
are worth the momentary gain...
when i jab a sharpened object in
choirs of angels seem to sing
hymns of hate in memorandum

and you might say it's self-indulgent
and you might say it's self-destructive
but, you see, it's more productive
than if i were to be happy

and sappy songs about sex and cheating
bland accounts of two lovers meeting
make me want to give mankind a beating

and you might say it's self-destructive
but, you see, i'd kick the bucket
sixty times before i'd kick the habit

and as the skin rips off i cherish the revolting thought
that even if i quit
there's not a chance in hell i'd stop
and anyone can see the signs
mittens in the summertime
thank you for your pity, you are too kind

and you might say its self-inflicted
but you see that's contradictive
why on earth would anyone practice self destruction?

and pain opinions are sitcom feeding
they dont know that their minds are teething
makes me want to give mankind a beating

i'm tried bandages and sinking
i've tried gloves and even thinking
i've tried vaseline
i've tried everything
and no-one cares if your back is bleeding
they're concerned with their hair receding
looking back it was all maltreating
every thought that occurred misleading

makes me want to give myself a beating....

bad habit // the dresden dolls."

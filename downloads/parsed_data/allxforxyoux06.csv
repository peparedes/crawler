"event","DogWood song....way sad...

I didn't die a natural death.
My life was stolen from me, before my first natural breath.
Casualty of circumstance.
Someone make a decision for me. 
They never gave me a chance. 

Chorus:
Where's that first birthday I hoped for?
The candle I'd blow out. 
No one will ever hear me laugh or ever see me smile.
I would've make my parents proud.

They weren't much more than children themselves.
I felt her honest reasons,
though she said it would further her health. 
I'm on the inside looking out.
Please don't just give up, at least give me to someone else.

(Chorus)

Adoption, abortion, am I responsible for your action? 
Life versus death, they make the choice, they let me go. 
Disregard human value.
What if your parents did this to you?
Victim of circumstance, this is our last dance.

Eleven weeks old today. 
My mother made a pro-choice, a purchase I would have to pay.
They found a price on my life. 
Consider this my farewell. My good bye.


this is my opinion so dont jump all over me and attack it....one think i dont like about kerry...he says its the womans choice to have abortion or not..its a free country and we have out rights..so does the kid...a right to live..people dont make condoms and diaphrams and all those things just to sit on the store shelves...so if you do decide to have sex then please use protection..i mean seriously..its not hard at all to use it...and if you end up pregnant..theres people out there that are here to help you. so please get help. abortion is murder....

if your still not sure look at this... http://www.abortionismurder.com/notconvinced.shtml  
look at own risks...
i think its a way sad website but it needs to get out there...what if your mom had an abortion..you wouldnt be here today...."

"event","k, so im back from cali. and im glad but then im not.
it was so much fun. but..the juniorhighers came with us..not cool. they made us have gay rules like. boys and girls cant sit next to each other.and no pda...like holding hands huging. gay!! we never have these rules but now that jrhigh came with us we did. and this one girl paige..holy crap i tell you shes the biggest slut and annoying person i have EVER met. shes sooo loud.
i met new kids like, seth, cris, nick..i knew him but i got to know him way better, ashley, natalie, estee, and more. but i got like nooo sleep. thebus rides were so annoying cause of paige..shes so loud you can hear here like 24/7...
so one night....me, david, sam, kris, and matt tried to take a secret elavator way, cause the elavators inside were like pakced full and took you like an hour to get to the 8th floor, which was my floor. and so then we took this secret one outside and it leads you to a parking garage and then you have to find some stairs. so we found some and we had to walk from the fouth floor to the 8th floor, not hard, just to find out that all the doors in that building are locked, even the bottom one we came in at. so we bang on number 7 cause thats where sam was staynig and cause we knew steven and kris would be there..well maybe it was floor 8..hmm. not sure, but anyways, qwe banged and banged and thyen they came to the door but were jerks and wouldnt let us in... so we were stuck in a stair well for like 30 m in. and its soooo hott in those things. we started to play cards. then we heard someone on the top floor opening the door. so we yelled at them to keep it open.and cris yells so loud...o crap guys getr your SHIT!!! and the youth pastor was at the top of the door thingy. it was sooo funny. we al just started laughing, the youth pastor i think didnt hear him.


so many people from ncs were there, layman, veronica, carolyn(those two girls said..o hi, and then left...thats it!) and then sam and justin and adriane but they used to go there. and then i met cameron philips and this kid brandon...two awesome kids!

EVERYONE, please all be VERY careful this sunday. i know its a huge holiday were everyone goes out and drinks and then is selfish and drives home just to wake up not knowning what they did and having one HUGE hangover...but some dont make it home..or the drinkin people make it home, but the ones who dont drink dont make it home cause the drinking ones hit them with a car....car accident..so everyone please be VERY careful sunday. 

i was at D.R. and i was walking into target and i saw this car and it said..RIP josh and jordan your in our prayers....that was so exciting to me to know that he had alot of people and so many people cared for him and his brother...

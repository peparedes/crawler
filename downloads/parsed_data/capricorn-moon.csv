"event","Ohh lets see. Nothing to really write about. I've been sick all weekend. I can't seem to kick it. No medicine is helping me. I can't afford to go to the doctor. I think my mom is tryin to get her doctor to call me in some medicine to the pharmacy over here, so all I'll have to do is just pay for the medicine itself. Hopefully. I need some antibotics. Let's see, Fri I opened and ran a really good time on Speed. After I got off, I went and hung out at Gary's house for alittle while. Then came home. Saturday is when I started getting sick. I had to open again. It was a really bad day. We were super super busy. And I felt so shitty. After work me and Ashley and Christy went to Glenda's house. We played poker, pool, and air hockey. Drank a little. It was ALOT of fun. I suck at poker. But we had a really good time. Left about midnight. Went home and crashed. Sun I slept alllll day. Didn't do shit. Very sick. I went and bought meds from Walmart, thats all. Today, Monday, I'm still as sick as I was yesterday but I have to go to work tonight so theres not much I can do about it. I just got off the phone with Dude, they are pretty mad at Dan. Appartently he owes them money or something. He needs to get his shit together. He is out job hunting right now. I don't know why it's taking him so long to get a freakin job. I'm sooooo sick of it. I'm gettin closer and closer to giving up. Welp, I'm going to go now. I'm sure you've heard enough of my boring life.hey"

"event","Well, I feel like shit. I'm suppose to start my period tomorrow and I'm all cramping and bloated. It sucks.
Lets see, after I typed my last entry, I stubbed my toe really hard on these metal thing that shouldnt be stickin out of my bed, but is.. and it cut my toe and ripped half of my toenail off on my second toe, so ive been limping around. It sucks. It was bleeding and throbbing. I swear it was like the worst pain in the world. It doesnt hurt to bad now. I closed last night and was so useless.
Wen, me and Dan went around and looked for jobs for him.. I tanned, we ate. Fed these two squirrels french fries and it was so cute. they love them. then i went to my manager meeting. After that, me and Gary went to Cape to buy our Keller tickets and when we got there they said the ticketmaster machine was messed up. I was so pissed. So we went and ate Thai food. Then went to the mall. They have a really cool store there now called Romanacing the Stone. It's awesome. We ran into Ashley and Matt and Steph there. Then we went to Barnes and Nobles and I looked at astrolgoy books, but I didnt buy any. :) Then we came home, went to his house, then went to walmart then I took him home, went and got Dan and went home and crashed.
Today, woke up and went to work. Worked my ass off bc we were super busy. Came home and ate nasty Wendy's dollar menu and now I'm watchin this VERY SICK movie called Gummo. It's so nasty. If you have ever seen the movie Kids, its made by the same ppl. Eww.
Well I must go now. Bye."

"event","Sorry I haven't wrote in a couple days. I have been feeling shitty and not in the mood to express myself to anyone.  Let's see:
Fri, I closed. I had a really good night. Other then that fact that Chris was in a bad mood. That kinda sucked. I was lookin forward to closing with him and he didn't feel to cheery. But everyone has their days, so its all good. I had fun with Christy. When we got off work, me and Christy went to Jared's house where Dan was at and got reallly high. Then about 5 am, we went home.
Sat, me and Dan layed in bed all day and didn't get up for no one. It was nice. I didnt do jack shit. I didnt even brush my teeth. lol I was so lazy. It was great though.
Sun, I had to open, I felt really shitty. I wasnt in a very good mood either. But I made it through the day.
Mon, I had to open, but it was a way better day. Got paid. Ran a 28 sec avg time on drive thru speed of service today during lunch. Which is outstanding. Dan forgot to come pick me up and take me to the bank, so I was pretty mad about that, but after I ran that 28 I was so pumped and happy I got over it. Then I gave him some money to go wash the car and vaccum it and his slow ass let himself run out of quarters and didnt save enough to vacumm it. Then I noticed these scratches all over the side drivers door. I about flipped. We are going to get some stuff to fix it, but still.. I'm extremely unhappy about the whole situation. I know it's from him driving it. I never drive the fuckin thing. Anyways, we were suppose to go eat at Dude and Heather's and drink some beer. But we were both in a bad mood by the time I got home from work, we called and cancelled. Then we went and got some McDonalds and some alcohol, came back here.. ate, drank, and played darts.. then crashed.
See, nothing to exciting, didnt feel like I should jump on here and type my little heart out. Dan still hasnt got a fuckin job yet, he only went to 2 freakin places yesterday even though he had all day. That is the reason we were in bad moods yesterday bc i was BITCHING at him. As soon as he gets back in a min, he is takin a shower and I am takin him to job places since he isnt grown up enough to do it on his own. I'm really fed up. Right now I'm so mad at him, I'm not even attracted to him. He gets on my nerves right now. I'm so unhappy with him, that he doesnt care enough about us to get a fuckin job. And some bitch that he knows keeps calling us, to see if we want to buy pills. It's pissing me off. She called 3 times last night AFTER i went to bed, and 2 times this morning before I was even up. I was like, what the fuck! Anyways, Dan's going to be home soon so I need to quit my bitchin and go. Bye"

<P>Well, I haven't been on here typing things lately. Let's see. I never went back to the doctor, I just slowed down on my pills and winged myself off of them so I'm not taking them anymore. I feel fine. I feel like they did the trick. I was stressed to the max and they took away my stress. They didn't take away my moods but I think that me being unhappy with my life is why I was/am in bad moods. I have goals that I am trying to fullfill to be happy, and once that stuff happens, I'll be a hell of a lot happier. I thought about tellling the doctor that the pills didnt work so I could get something stronger to take for the fun of it, but I don't want to become a junkie pill head. I know a few people like that, and I despise them. So here I am, back to normal I should say. I'm not taking anything and I feel okay so it's cool.</P>
<P>Dan put forth some effort on the job scene. He actually went somewhere besides W W. He went to Save A Lot, Movie Gallery, Walmart, Stanfields, and W W yesterday. But I know at Movie Gallery u can only work 20 hours, so he will have to get another job if he gets hired there. I work 50 a week, so he wont get by on a little 20 crappy hours. I rather him just work at W W, but they aren't hiring ANYONE. I have found out several ppl are tryin and they aren't saying anything or hiring anyone, they are makin everyone wait and go nuts. So maybe their just testing ppl. I don't know.</P>
<P>I'm going to try to figure out how to put my pics from my bday on here. It's on a Walmart disk and it's kinda confusing.</P>
<P>I went to Gary's and hung out with him and Randy last night. Dan went to Jared's. It was cool, we did our own thing. We came home and I cooked rotell and he cooked pizza and we munched out. It was fun. I love to eat.</P>
<P>Me and Chris work together like everyday on this week's scedule. We close together tonight. We were talking about gettin my cuz out of the house and taking her to maybe the Call of the Wild or something of that sort. ;)</P>
<P>Well, well, well, I guess I'm going to go fiddle with these pics... bye for now!</P>"

I only have like 3 pills left. I am going to call them in the morning and act like I thought it was tomorrow or something and try to get in Friday.
Cant type long, got a managers meeting in 15 mins.
Dan went to W W again today, and once again they jsut noted that he came by. I freakin heard on the radio when I was tannning today that they are hiring! Fukkers. So I made Dan say, ""what do I need to do to get this job."" and they said something about there are so many applications and different parts are hring and its a big mess or some fucked up shit. So I'm about to give up on W W and just make him go work at freakin Town n Country for all I care. 
I have to get out of this house!!!!
I talked to my ex Ben today, I havent talked to him in a bout a 6 months. He is going to school full time and he is an EMT right now. Imagine that. My EX bf is doing pretty damn good.
Well I gotta go."

<P>Well Dan just got back from W W and when he got there, they were looking at his app! They told him not to worry about turnin in another app, and he said his app was laying right there. He said that the sectary and manager were sittin there lookin over apps. The sectary said his app is active and she would put in that he came by again. So hopefully he'll get hired. On his way home, he passed his dad and his dad works at Arvin, and he said Arvin is going to start hiring next week and they might give him a job. So we'll see.</P>

Sat I worked until 6 and then went to Bluff to see my mama, her bday is today, well, was Sunday. We got all dressed up and went to a bar, an old country bar out in the country called Mel's Bar. It was werird. The cigertte smoke was about to choke me out, my eyes where burning like crazy. Everyone kept buying me drinks, I was plastered. I didn't spend a dime. Well I bought my mom a drink for her birthday, but it was cool, even ppl I didnt know bought me drinks. Then my uncle Steve got up and did karaoke, and said  ""Braaandy, where are you, get up here and dance. She just turned 21!"" And everyone started cheering and tryin to pull me up to the dance floor. It was horrid. Thankfully I got out of it and didn't have to dance or anything, but I did get to set there for four hours with a buch of smokers and drunks. I got beer spilled all over me too, it sucked. lol. And my mom kept tryin to hook me up with like every guy. I was like omg mom. lol It was fun though. We came home and ate some munchies and crashed. It was cool to stay the night at their house.
Got up and ate McDonalds for breakfast. Watched Super Troopers, Kill Bill 2, and House of Cards. Pretty good movies. Then I was bored out of my mind so decided to come home.
Came home, got online, found out my cuz and her bf broke up.. sorry Desert. Loves youuuu. Then I went to pick up and Dan. Ate Wendy's. Came home and played wih my Allisyn...we played Pac Man and she calls it Ghost. hehe. She's so silly. Mimi scratched her foot and and I said, ""Come here, I'll doctor you up"" and put a little band aid on it, it was a lil bitty scratch but afterwards she was going around telling everyone that I doctored her up and she felt better.. hehe, I love her so much.
Anwyays, then I made a astrology thing for my cousin about how her month of Jan will be based on her sun, moon, and ascendant to cheer her up a lil. Gotta take care of my blood. ;)
Btw, Desert, I can't find those icons u sent me anywhere, they arent in recieved files and ive searched everywhere, its weird. :( Maybe you can post them on here and I can steal them from you.. if all else fails. 
Welp, must go to bed, very sleepy. Gotta get up and go tan and deposit my check. Love you all.

He has an interview at W W Wood if he would freakin get his ass out there. He woke me up today tryin to have sex, and I'm sorry, but on MY day off, well I'm not off, I close tonight.. but when I get to sleep in, I want to sleep in. Then we can have sex. That may just be me, but I love sleep and I get very bitchy if i don't get what I want. And he kept tryin to wake me up to have sex and it was pissing me off and then my bladder was killing me bc I had to pee so bad so I couldnt fall back asleep until my ass got out of bed to piss, then by then I was to wide awake. So I got mad and told Dan he wasn't getting any sex and I got up and starting cleaning my NIGGERASS looking room. He went to get us something to eat at Subway and came back with no food bc the line was to long. Then layed back down to go to sleep. I was like what the fuck. So I started bitching about him getting up and going to W W Wood and we got in a fight and somehow he ended up leaving to get us food again, but this time he came back with only my food so I know he'll be complaining later about being hungry when he should of got the food when he had the chance. Then he was giving me the silent treatment so we started arguing more and he stormed off and went to W W and was being a dick about it. Am I wrong for being a bitch to him? I want him to freakin get a job! I'm tired of supporting his lazy ass. All he does is want, want, want. He's getting so old. I'm soooo sick of it. There.. I vented.. lol I feel a lil better.

I wanna hang out with Chris because he's off. :( Damnit. DAN NEEDS TO GET A FREAKING JOB.
 I worked all day today. With my district manager to say the least. It sucked, my anxiety was going crazy. On top of that I was training a manager today so its even harder when your having to teach someone how to do YOUR stuff when she's there breathing down your neck. But it actually went better then i thought. It just annoyes me when she says stuff like ""You know you would lose less chips if u put less on the nachobell and more beans."" I'm like, ""Yeah, I underportion and jip the customer bc we lose 100 lbs of beans a week."" It's really annoying. She needs to go pick on the shift managers. Not me. lol

It sucks because we went 5 days straight without even looking at each other the wrong way. But thats a start considering we used to fight a few times a day.

Also I was wrong, its not ""Boost Bars"" its called Buspirone and ppl just called it Buzz Bars or whatever. It doesnt give me any energy. Makes me kinda dizzy actually. It's made to reduce stress, tension, and anxiety. It helps at home, and I've been alot more social lately, but as soon as I walked in the door tonight at work, it was like everything was just washed away. But it was almost time to take it again so that might have something to do with it. I kept getting all angry bc I had a headset on and the customers were driving me insane. Their voices were getting on my nerves. Anyways, I'm rambeling. I am going to ask for something stronger, in 2 wks when I go back.
Other then that, tonight was just a typical Tuesday. Now me and Dan are sittin here smoking a bowl chillin.. trying to wind down. Guess I'll go, toot-a-lou!"

Even Allisyn called me and said happy bday in her cute little voice.
I had a great time at Gary's. It sucked though because his grandma had to get taken to the ER so everyone got kinda sad, then like and hour they call and his grandpa died. Two different sides of family, but in the same night. When it rains it pours. So I didn't really feel like being there. So we left and came home. I did drink alittle, I bought a bottle of wine. He carded me twice, lol. He was like, ""Wait, can I see that again"" It was neat to buy it, even though that sounds stupid. 
I'm about to go to sleep I guess. I'm full and tired. I wish my dig camera software was on here, I got some really good pics but its all on disposable cameras, I'll have to get a disk when I get the film developed so I can put my pics on here. My cake was crazy, it was suppose to be like astrology, but it looked kinda.. weird. but its all good.. gosh I'm so full I Feel like i'm going to puke. Blah.

I go back in two weeks so if it's not doing the trick I'll get something stronger. I took one and it seemed to help me though, I've been in a great mood all day. That might have something to do with it being my bday though. :)

After I went to the doc, I went and seen my mom at work and she gave me a Febreze player, I've been wanting one for awhile, I know, I like weird stuff. But it is really cool. My uncle got me a patchwork blanket, and I love patchwork so I need to call and thank him.

Then we went to Hastings and I got two new astrology books to add to my growing collection. I love it!! :)

When I got home I had a bunch of messages on my machine of ppl wishing me and SINGING me happy birthday. It made me really happy. Let's see, I've heard from Jessica, Heather, Dude, Jared, Chris, Gary, Desert, Ashley Reyes, Ashley Lefler, Steph, Matt, Joe, parents and Dan of course and even Dan's mom called and sang on my machine. Even Kristin Tomley called, but she called my dad's phone instead, oh well its the thought that counts. hehe. 

Well, Dan is gone gettin stuff ready for tonight, I'm going to go to Gary's and party I'm guessing, I have no clue what's in store for me and this is the first time ever anyone besides my parents have thrown me a party and I'm excited. 

So, talk to you soon!!!"

"event","Welp, it's my first, a little late.. but I'm here. hehehe. Welp, tomorrow is my bday, I'm excited. I think Dan is throwing a party for me at Gary's house. Not positve though. There is some people I need to get ahold of.
I am going to the doctor tomorrow, hopefully I will get put on some nerve pills because I have been stressing out bad lately. My heart even feels all werid. I'm always in a bad mood. It sucks. The job is really gettin to me, then I'm having problems with Dan and my dad, and MONEY. And I'm ready to get out of this damn house. But the car payment and insurance is kinda high so it's setting me back. Plus I like to buy stuff. :) I've moved out before but I didnt have a car payment.
Wow, I am rambling. Well I have to to Taco Bell and give someone a ride home so I guess I am going to go now. And when I get back I will try to find some losers to read this shit.. j/k ;) Welp, love alls, even though no one but maybe my cuz Desert knows about this.  Byyyye."

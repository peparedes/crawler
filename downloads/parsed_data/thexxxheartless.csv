"event","I do not want anyone to get the wrong idea from the title. It just feels like I'm an emotional sadomasochist. Emotionally, I seem to have the ability to cripple people that I care about and that (I hope) care about me.&nbsp; This, and everything that has been going through my head lately makes me think maybe I enjoy others destroying my emotional stability. Why??? I don't want to fuck with people's heads just because my own is screwed up! That is not fair to them. To anyone I've done this to (Yes, that means you, and you know who you are) I am extemely sorry. I will work to mend any damage I have inevitably caused.&nbsp; 
I'm lonely. But I'm not Gerard Way. ""I won't go down by myself, but I'll go down with my friends."" Not me. I refuse to (on purpose) drag my friends down with me. I want them to have better emotional stability than me. Maybe I'm a love addict? (Thank you, Mr. Palahnuik, for giving me the basis for such a phrase). Maybe, once&nbsp;I know what it's like to be in a relationship in which I am fairly certain the other person loves me, and the relationship ends, all I can think of is finding someone to satiate my loneliness. Gah. Not fair, to me or anyone that I've dragged into this downward spiral of emotional instability. All three of the people I have had one-week or less relationships with in the past month or so, I apologize desperately. Please do not be angry with me. I couldn't stand that. (Thinking about what I'm writing, this makes no sense, because only two of these people have LJ accounts, and neither have used them since they got them. Dammit. Sorry. ) Anyvay, on a happy note... 

Ricardo loves Lauryn!!! HA! And I threatened him. So, I've accomplished what I wanted to. But, unfortunately,&nbsp; Ricardo seems&nbsp;to have NOT broken up with his girlfriend. Who treats him like a sack of potaoes (If this analogy doesn't make sense, think about&nbsp;what potatoes go through, especially in Ireland, yet they are still there, dressed up all nice to be eaten by people&nbsp;who don't give a shit about where they came from. Just think.) Okay, the analogy&nbsp;doesn't make a lot of sense, but&nbsp;the point is, she isn't treating him the way he deserves. And I have been told by a somewhat reliable source that he isn't going to break up with her, because Phillip likes Lauryn. Even though he is&nbsp;a creepy stalker dude and feaks us all out, including Lauryn. And the fact that,&nbsp;if Ricardo was single, and liked Lauryn, but she didn't like him, and&nbsp;Phillip knew Ricardo like her, and&nbsp;she liked Phillip, Phillip would go out with her, regardless of how it made Ricardo feel. Or, the short version, If Ricardo was in Lauryn's position,&nbsp;and Phillip in Ricardo's, and Lauryn in... Aw, fuck it. You understand, right? Anyway, you can tell, I don't think too highly of Phillip. If I played bass, and not regular guitar (Or even if I just HAD one, I can learn.) I would offer to take his position in the band, for Lauryn and Ricardo's sake. &nbsp;I feel bad saying this, since I don't talk to Phillip much, and I don't know&nbsp; him too well, so my allegations could be incorrect, but I don't think anyone is really comfortable with Phillip anymore. Sorry, to Phillip and Lauryn if I'm overreacting. Anyvay, this is what&nbsp;goes through my head. Minus some of the crap&nbsp;no one should ever be subjected to. So no one can blame me for my opinion of the situation. I just care about my friends. Sorry.&nbsp; 

That wasn't mush happier,&nbsp;was it? Oh, well... &nbsp;&nbsp;"

Okay, this is a bit of an exaggeration. Not <em>everyone, </em>but most of everyone <em>I </em>care about. I might still be in love with my ex... Once again, its difficult to use that word. God, I'm sick of life. I want a relationship, but I'm not sure if it's because I miss my old <em>armas.</em>&nbsp; I don't want to get into something just because I'm lonely. I've been lonely before, I know myself, I can handle the game (Thank you, Lauri Ylonen.) The piont is, I need to let someone come to me. This is what happened before.&nbsp;<br /><em>Flashback<br /></em>When I was younger, I tried to make friends and I was damn good at it. I had plenty of friends. But later in those friendships, I finally had to stand up for myself, because my friends sucked and I let them walk all over me. So i stopped trying to make friends. Now, I have the best people on the planet for my friends. And, as an added bonus, they are all extremely interesting. I get to observe them!<br /><em>End Flashback<br /></em>So, I have decided to just stop trying to find people. I'm sure someone amazing (Who won't wake up one morning and not love me anymore [ Don't worry, I don't hold this against you]) will come to me in time. Or I'll maybe go crazy. Whichever happens first. <br />"

He said that when I go back, I have to be able to speak some Finnish to him. And I will. As of now, I only have curses and other obscenities memorised.

And I don't hink I can do a relationship right now. I went through three people in the past month or so... And right after being dumped (I can hardly think of it that way... The person is still so close to me...)&nbsp; by someone I went out with for about three months. I get attatched to people if they're near me too long, so... Wow, I am confused. I don't know if I want to be loved. I think that maybe, if I stop looking, someone wonderful will find me. Thats what happened with my friends. After going through some really shitty friendships in which I was teased, abused (Physically, mentally and emotionally), walked on, and neglected, I just gave up. For a while I was antisocial, refusing to talk to people. I still do this with unfamiliar people. Sadly, I do this still with people I should be used to by now. But, the point is, once I stopped looking, some of the most important people in my life found me. I want to trust them, but I'm afraid of getting hurt again (This sounds like 'Dear Abby'....!) I'm just having a hard time dealing with anyone right now. And I want to be supportive of my friends, but I don't know how!!!"

"event","<p>Wow... I'm tired... No, exhausted. Emotionally. I want to just detatch from life for a little while... I think I will. Not like I'm not going to respond to what people say to me, it's just... It will be like I'm depressed or tired, but for more than just an hour or a day.<br />Sorry.</p>"

AHHH! I'm tired, but I've been playing on myspace all night long...Er, since I got home from work....I looked at my Hunk-a-mancandy's myspace....DAMN HE'S SECKSI!!!! UGH! I'm crazy in lust, or love, or something. I'm rambling, so me and Ash are gonna hit the sack....But I did take a shower, finally, I know that sounds gross, like I take a shower like every day, but I didn't one day and before tonight, I don't really remember when the last time I had a full shower was, like, I'd wash my hair, or take a whore bath, but I never washed it all at the same time....I am rambling like an emeffer, so I'm going to bed, I love each and every one of you that doesn't piss me off constantly...Sleep good and have a WONDERFUL night!!!

You all know we can't live without you!!!! Why do you take advantage of it????? AGH! Oh well, I guess I'll never find the answer to that one....A really hott guy asked me for my number last night, and of course, I gave it to him, lord help he's beautiful.....He hasn't called me, he probably won't, but I don't care, cuz I'm nuts and he doesn't want to date me because I'm still nuts about James....ANywho, I'm gonna go and quit wasting precious minutes out of your lives!!!

"event","I think about it more and more every day....I can't help it, little things remind me of it then depress me. Kari and James broke up, she dumped him, and then she apologized for being such a bitch to me...Of course, I told her it was ok because I was the same way when he and I were together. But then I found out, out of all the girls he proposed to, I'm the only one that got a ring.....Should that make me feel like he honestly cared about me? Or should that just make me think that he was trying harder with me than anyone else to have sex. I miss who I used to be.....I know I've been aweful lately, and I'm sorry....I know the reason why he left is because I was so insecure and I always assumed the worst, but how can I not when he did me wrong before? He's throwing his life away, he's only been to school 3 days out of the past 3 weeks. I think that when he goes to NTI he'll leave me alone forever. But how can I know for sure? I don't know what I would do if he tried to come back into my life for the 3rd time....I'd probably go nuts. The Keeton boys sure do have a way with words. I was ok until he called me the other day, just hearing his voice and hearing him say my name the exact same way he used to send me through a loop. I've got to figure out how to deal with this. I want him to give me my ring back. I want to give him the one he gave me, and I want to forget all about him. I want him gone, I want him to leave me alone, I don't want to see his face every time I close my eyes, but how do I accomplish this task that has consumed me for 2 years? For 2 years I tried to stop loving him, then when I was almost ok he came trudging back screwing everything up, now it will take me just as long to be ok....Why? God I'm confused....Oh well, maybe one of these days I'll finally realize he doesn't deserve me.....Maybe"

<center>This shit don't even make you sweat
Am I who you think about in bed?
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking as you're sliding off your pants
I think about what you did
And how I hope to God she was worth it 
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing as your fingers touch your skin
I've got more wit, 
A better kiss
A hotter touch
A better fuck
Than any girl you'll ever meet
Sweetie you had me 
I hope that you look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger's seat
You know it will always just be me
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold the lever close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold the lever close?</center>


It fits...no? I hope to shit she was worth it to him...That's all I can say"

"event","So, I've been keeping myself EXTREMELY busy lately, maybe it's so I won't think about everything so much....I don't know. I've been working 6 days a week, covering shifts of the people who quit.....I've been so busy, like tonight, me and Ashleigh went shopping after I cut Megan's hair...(Which by the way was probably a mistake, but it looks really good.) Every time I hear a song that's remotely depressing I get upset....Maybe I'm just not able to handle being alone, maybe I depend so much on guys because the man I thought I could depend on wasn't very dependable....(And no I'm not talking about James.) You know how people say ""the only man a girl can depend on is her daddy""? Well what happens when you can't even depend on him? Where does that leave you? Where did it leave me? Somehow in the midst of all of this, I've lost myself....I have completely lost touch with who I am and who I am going to be.....I want to know everything like I used to, I want to be me again, but one by one heartless guys have taken little bits of me with them until there's nothing left, leaving me here, alone, empty, and feeling nothing.....Nothing but warm wet tears rolling down my cheeks, flowing more and more with each breath I take. I miss being loved, I miss being admired, I miss being held and kissed and cared about....I miss it all. Why can't I just be happy? I know we've been down this road before, but why do I have to take the shitty road every time instead of the smooth straight one? What do you do when you have nothing? Do you cry and feel sorry for yourself or move on and be ok? What happens if you try to move on and be ok and fail? Where am I going to end up? Why me? It's not fair, all I've ever asked for is to be happy and as soon as I get to that point someone rips my heart from my chest and smashes it on the ground in front of me.....Why do I let them? Why do I give them so much of me to demolish? How do I rebuild what's been ripped apart in front of me? There is so many things I want to know, so many questions I need answers, so much of me that I need back.....But it won't happen, the good guy always finishes last, that is, if they finish.....

There is however, this one person, that has completely intrigued me....I've gathered my thoughts about him several times and turned every little detail over and over in my head, and still, I'm overwhelmed by him. He's unique, almost to a fault, he's shy, which is beautiful, he's tall, attractive in almost every way, and his eyes, oh his eyes, they seem to glow and I always find myself lost in their depth. He has got my full attention every second I'm near him, when I feel him near me I gleam, just the thought of him makes me smile. His smile....His smile completely entraps me....Monday he looked at me and smiled and I could hardly breath, I couldn't move, speak, or even think....There is no man that has every left me breathless, even with a kiss, or a touch, but all he has to do is get me lost in his eyes and I would never have to breath again. It's weird how that works isn't it? I get butterflies when I see his screen name on my buddy list.....His name, his name rolls off of my tongue like I should say it more often, he has my full attention, my complete and total adoration, and he doesn't even know it. How can I tell him all this? How can I make him know without saying a word? Maybe I'll figure it out, maybe not, maybe he'll graduate and I'll forget all about him, maybe not.....I'll talk to you guys later!"

All she has done for him is make him lose respect for his parents, his job, his friends, and most importantly, himself. He went to a party at her house last night, where his girlfriend's mom was buying alcohol for him, James likes to drive when he drinks, and she'd let him....They don't care about him, not like I do. UGH!!! I am so confused. I want to tell him to stop, just be like, James, don't do this to yourself, she doesn't deserve you, she's making you different....But I don't know if he'd listen....I want him back, and I want him to be like he was when I was with him.....But how do I do that?"

"event","<center>Is true love really true
If it slowly falls apart?
Can the echoes of the laughter
Mend your broken heart?
Can the silence that's become you
Help to ease your pain?
Can the sadness that inhabits you
Teach you to love again?

Do good things really come
To those who have to wait?
Do people really have the means
To rearrange their fate?
If you can see the sunshine
Through your overflowing tears,
Then why is it so hard for you
To see through all your fears?

Do second chances only happen
To those who deserve?
Those who adjust accordingly
When life throws a curve
Those who can accept
The good things with the bad
And be thankful for the memories
Of the love they once had.

Can lightning strike the same place twice?
And cupid's arrow, the same heart?
Does God take pity on those 
Who are miserable when apart?
Will he ever reach out
To take your hand once more?
Or will there be only memories?
Apart.....forever more....</center>"

He says he just wants to be friends, but I can't handle it....I can't pretend to be his friend when every time I see him I hope that maybe he's looking at me like I look at him....Maybe he wants to be with me again, maybe it'll be different this time. I can't live my life like that. I can't wait around for him to want me. I love him more than I can even explain.....But he has hurt me and keeps hurting me more than I've ever been hurt in my entire life by anyone. I have nothing left because of him. I just wish he knew how much I wanted to be with him. I think I'm going to have to end up telling him that I can't wait around for him anymore, and that one day he's going to call me or come by and I won't answer or be there......And it won't be until that day that he realizes that he's really lost me and realizes what he's lost.....I guess that's just what I'm going to have to do.....::sobs loudly:: I love him but I can't let him do this to me forever....

"event","Every car that goes by sounds like yours
Every face in the crowd has your smile
Every time someone knocks on the door I just know it's you
But you know what?
It's never you
You don't want me anymore
And surprisingly, I understand that
I've realized that I don't need you
Nor do I want you
I'm happy with just being Cassie
Not Cassie and Jonathan
I don't want that
I never did
I just thought you were everything
Until you weren't
I just wanted to say
That I hope you're happy with her
Cuz guess what....
You don't have me to run to anymore
I'm done with you"

"event","We're countin down ladies and jets!!!!! 2 days till I drive!!!!

Got some new shoes today, they look like the high top Converse shoes, but I got them at Wal Mart for 8 dollars.....SHHH don't tell! 

OK, so I've been to the Huntsville Wal Mart 3 times this weekend (where Heather works) and she hasn't been there, I wanted to make her look like a jackass in front of all her co-workers......Oh well, I guess I'll have to try again next weekend. 

Sam's Club is the coolest place in the world....If you haven't been, you should go. 

Got spoiled last night cuz I was the only one home....I finally got the black sheets and comforter I wanted....SCORE!!! Got some fingernail polish and lipgloss and sheets and perfume and a bunch of cool stuff....SCORE!!! Who doesn't love stuff???

I fell in love with the most beautiful Mullucan Cockatoo this morning....His name is Jesse, and he can start a car. And Linda said he didn't talk much and the only thing he would say is hello and his name, well, I was holding him today and he told me he loved me.....And he cried when I left.....The only reason I couldn't have him is because some other lady had already put a down payment on him.....Damn her.....

Saw a girl in Wal Mart that looked exactly like Jenny, but it wasn't Jenny....oops

So I think that pretty much sums up my weekend....Not sure though....hold on let me think....NOOOO!!!! I wrote something yesterday! I'll put it in the next entry!!!! I love you guys!"

"event","Went to the game last night....We lost....Shana made 10th grade rep....Congrats Shana....Brittney got Homecoming Queen.....Boo on her. Went to the dance with Bubba....Had fun. I think he humped me....Oh well. I danced with Kayla a lot, I miss her!!! Did the cha cha slide with Whitney....Fun fun. I really did have fun....I just am still empty....Even though I'm filling myself up with other things, parties, games, dances, people, I still feel so empty. Last night before the game I went over to Megan's to do her hair and stuff...And when she got home after the dance her mom said she was worried about me. And it made so much sense as to why she felt that way.....She said I wasn't acting like I was excited about it and I was doing everything for Megan before I did it for myself and she said that even though I looked beautiful, I didn't act like I felt it. She said that she thought I wasn't getting attention, because my dad's the way he is, I don't get along with my stepmom, I don't really get along with my stepdad, and my mom's so busy with her birds. She said that the only person who ever paid any attention to me was Jonathan and now I don't have him. She got really upset about it when she was telling Megan, and I don't want her to be upset because I feel like this.....I can't help it. I want so much to be happy, but I just can't. I really am trying to be happy, but it's not working, there's only one thing that will make me happy and I can't have it ever ever again......How the hell am I supposed to feel?"

"event","I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me
But every one around me
Because of you
I am afraid....

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weaknedd in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
Every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break 
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you 
I find it hard to trust not only me 
But every one around me 
Because of you
I am afraid....

I watched you die
I heard you cry
Every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should've known
Better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you...."

"event","Hey guys! Goodness, Mrs. Fuqua moved me away from James today....::tear:: I am so freakin mad at her. I have a book report due for Coach Collins tomorrow....Goodness me. So a guy that used to be in love with me is working on my brother's porch....He said hi to me today when I got home and played with my dog when they were taking a break....Coincidence? I THINK NOT! So yes Daron, I wrote that, but not about Jonathan, obviously, but no I'm not mad at you, it's just rare that I answer LJ comments and I hardly ever send emails. I'm usually not online long enough to send one but I will when I get on. You haven't done anything wrong you've actually given me some wonderful advice....And guess what? I dyed my hair black too!!! HAHA How funny! We must have the same brain or something. Well anyway, today sucked, I have never been more tired and I've never hated school more. It just sucks so bad, I feel like I need a boyfriend, but then again, I don't want to love anyone right now and I know all relationships lead to love....Boo on love....I wanted so bad to go to Homecoming, but I am still dateless....So therefore I won't go, because it'll be stupid if I don't have anyone to dance with. Sometimes I want to just ask every guy that walks by if they'd want to go out with me, may seem desperate but hey, this is the first time I've been single for more than 2 weeks in like 5 years. I don't need a guy to complete me so I'll try to get off that. I miss the way things used to be though, I miss it so bad I could scream. I just want my friend back, I want a friend actually. I miss that. I miss him telling me that all guys are jerks and no one's good enough for me and I miss him taking care of me when I was so shitfaced I did 4 kegstands in a row, and I really miss the talks, I miss talking to him, for a long time, he seemed so smart, till we dated then he was stupid, but I miss talking, we had such deep talks and he thought so deep and he had such a beautiful mind. If there's anyone out there like this, let me know.....Tell him I've been looking for him!

"event","Went out of town yesterday,
We were so close I felt if I could just reach out a little farther I would feel your hand 
Drove by your house too,
Thought of you some more
Missed you yesterday
Can't stand you're so far away
Miss your smile, your eyes
If I could just see you one more time then I'd be alright
I met a guy yesterday
Would tell you all about him, but you'd find something wrong with him too
It's flattering to think that maybe you find something wrong with all these guys because you think they're not good enough for me
I think I flatter myself too much
I never said thank you
For helping me find the real me
You kept me going when I didn't want to see tomorrow
When I was lost you let me back to sanity
You helped me through the worst part of my life

With the preacher's son 
Everybody says he's crazy 
But I'll have to see 
I finally moved to Jackson 
When the summer came 
I won't have to pay that boy 
To rake my leaves 
I'm probably going on and on 
It seems I'm doing more of that these days 
 
I probably wouldn't be this way 
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad 
I never pictured every minute without you in it 
Oh, you left so fast 
Sometimes I see you standing there 
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch 
Sometimes i feel that i'm so lucky 
To have had the the chance to love this much 
God, give me a moments grace 
Cause if i'd never seen your face 
I probably wouldn't be this way 

Mama says, that i just shouldn't speak to you 
Susan says, that i should just move on 
You oughtta see the way these people look at me 
When they see round here talking to this stone 
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind 
But I just take it day by day 
 
I probably wouldn't be this way 
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad 
I'd never pictured every minute without you in it 
Oh, you left so fast 
Sometimes I see you standing there 
Sometimes I feel an angels touch 
Somethings I feel that I'm so lucky 
To have had the chance to love this much 
God, give me a moment's grace 
Cause if I'd never seen your face 
I probably wouldn't be this way 
I probably wouldn't be this way

Boy: ( cutting her off ) ugh i'm so mad
Girl: why? whats wrong ?

Boy: just lost a championship game,

and im catching a cold
Girl: well hey there will always be other games,

Boy: bye
Girl: wait i want to give you some...
Boy: cant it wait til tommorow ?
Girl: yeah sure
Girl: bye
Boy: bye


2 hours later a friend of hers asks her to go for a drive ...she goes.....
her friend swerved to avoid a truck....hitting a tree instead
her friend was killed instantly....shes in critical condition

This is the conversation between her sister and her boyfriend

Sister: omg ( crying )
Boy: what? whats wrong ?
Sister: my sister...your gf was involved in a major car wreck
Boy: is she ok ? ?????
Sister: shes in critical condition
Boy: i'll be there in 10 minutes


He shows up to the hospital room ...standing outside the door
going over the last conversation in his mind over and over as he
heard the machines beep and beep and breathing tubes pump


Boy: she wanted to give me something or tell me something
Girls mom: yeah this...

it was an envelope smelling like she did sealed with a kiss in lipstick
he opened it.....
it said ..... your everything to me....i love you with everything i am
and everything i have...i want to spend the rest of my life with you
sealed in it was a ripped movie ticket from the first movie they went to
and the first picture they took together
he kissed the picture as a tear fell from his face onto the picture
it looked as if in the picture she was crying
then the machines flatlined....3 minutes later she was pronounced dead

If you have any heart...any soul...or want to be happy you will repost this.
if you care for someone ...do not let something like this ever happen

Post this in the next 200 seconds and you WILL have THE best
day of your life THIS SATURDAY. You're number one *love* Will
either kiss you, ask you out, or call you or better. If
you break this chain you will have a lousy day on Saturday, and
you know you can"

"event","I hate today, as I did yesterday. I have felt like crap for 3 days. I cried really hard Sunday night. I got to really missing Jonathan. I really miss Jonathan all the time. I saw him Friday night and I gave him Ashley's number to call me, but he never did, I don't know why I expected it to be any different. I hope Megan got her license today....I heard that's what she was doing so GOOD LUCK MEGAN!!! UGH...I drove today in Driver's Ed, it was crazy, Eric drove and I thought I was going to die! It was absolutely CURRAZIE!!! I just wish I could talk to Jonathan, I just wish I could see him and hold him and kiss him and tell him how sorry I am for everything. He's the only thing I want and I've ever wanted. Maybe I can do something to open his eyes and show him how much I really love him. Jon said that he has homeroom with him and everytime someone says my name he gets real quiet and listens real hard. So I guess he still cares, but I need more than that, I need to be with him, he's the only thing that kept me together and without him I just fell apart. I feel like part of me is missing. Anywho, I'll update on how that goes, I'm going to try to talk to him tomorrow. I love ya'll!!!

I wrote him a letter, and I asked him to call me, but he hasn't....I don't think he will, but damnit I'm trying. I LOVE HIM! WHY THE HELL CAN'T HE GET THAT THROUGH HIS THICK SKULL?!?!?!?!?! UGH! I cleaned the WHOLE nasty house today...I'm getting paid for it tomorrow...YAY! Me and Ashley are going to the ball game and then we're going to her house and then the baby shower on Saturday....FUN FUN! So my sister in law's baby is out of NICU they had to put him in there right after the C-Section because he wasn't breathing good....She didn't even get to hold him....How sad. But he's ok now, and he's beautiful! I can't wait till Ashley has her baby! Anywho, I think I'm going to go and get in the shower so I can shave and scrunch my hair OK! I love you guys!

So 4th period Skylar and Cameron and Kyle were talking and I heard my name so I was like, yea ok whatever, and then Skylar asked my sister what she would do if she came home and Kyle was doin me in the butt....Eww....And Skylar kept staring at me and it was making me ill. They all kept lookin at me actually, but Katie said they weren't making fun of me so that's a plus. I think he's trying to write me a note...Why it's taking so long I don't know. They put a note on my desk for when I got back from lunch and I picked it up and Skylar took it back....I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON!!!! And it's fun. I aggravated the crap out of James 4th period.....It was funny....My dad says I'm going to marry him, and says he loves me....If that's love then I've been wrong this whole time....Anywho, my dad's like, starving and he wants me to make him a plate so I have to go......EFF!

You think that maybe something came up and ha hasn't had a chance to get on? Or maybe he didn't feel good and is sleeping? Eh, I don't care, I give up anyway. So James and Matt Freeman just left....James was really drunk and wouldn't give Matt the keys to his truck....It's Monday night and James is out getting shitfaced? LUCKY!!!! I'm thinking about just drinking a little to make me sleep better, but I don't know. It was hilarious.....James was all laying out of the side of the truck and he smelled really bad.

"event","I cut my own hair last night....It looked horrible. It was really uneven and I didn't notice it until last night, and yea, I cut it myself, and I had to go get it fixed today and it looks so much better! Christie's really sick, she had to get a shot today cuz she kept runnin a high fever and her neck was really swollen. She's one sick kid. So I've talked to that guy I like a lot this weekend, I'm talking to him now, but I still can't tell him I like him. UGH!!!! He asked me if Jonathan and I were still together, so maybe that's a sign that he's interested, but I don't know, it's hard to tell! Jonathan said that he only asked if someone was in a realationship if he was interested, so maybe that means he's interested!!! I sure do hope so. He knows where I live, but maybe that's cuz his best friend lives like a hundred feet away, but yea, maybe it means because he wants to know where I live. Ugh....I really like him, and the more I talk to him, the more I like him, I HATE BEING SHY!!!! I'm gonna tell him one day, just not today. Oh I dyed my hair this weekend, it looks hott, the color was like, cocoa, maybe, but it washes out with 28 shampoos, so I'm gonna have to redye it with permanent color next week. Well, it's taken me like an hour to write this because I've been talking to everyone else, so I'm gonna get off here and help my mom make dinner OK! I love ya'll!

It was funny. So I'm real bored, I'm supposed to be cleaning, but boo on cleaning. Ooh, Christie has mono, haha....Sucks for her. I gave a bird a bath today....Fun fun....Didn't get to talk to that guy I like last night, but oh well. So the pep rally yesterday was awesome, I danced with Jenny, it was great. I love pep rallies. Mrs. Tomlin's mad at my 3rd period, we're too ""rambunctious"" I like being rambunctious....It's fun. So, I wore a grass skirt all day yesterday, it was awesome.....I finally shaved my legs....Hadn't shaved in a month till yesterday morning. I pitched a fit last night, I was just mad because I had to sit at home on a Friday night. I think I'm going to the Big Spring Jam next weekend, the only way I'll go is if I know I'll be able to get drunk.....I need to get drunk. My computer in Katie's room won't work, it really pissed me off last night and I kicked it. I'm very ill....I could care less now if Jonathan called or wrote to me, I realized that he doesn't deserve me....I just can't believe things ended like that. Eh, oh well. So the guy I like is really shy, and I'm really shy, boo on being shy, and I don't know if I should tell him, I don't know how to tell him, it's making me very very ill. ANywho, I've been sitting here for an hour trying to get a picture of me as my icon on here so I'm going to try some more OK! I love you guys!

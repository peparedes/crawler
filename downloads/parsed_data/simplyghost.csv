I cook, clean, book new gigs.  He brings home extra cash from his EZ Mart job.

I think customer service always drains the cheerfulness from anyone who musters all th eir control not to rip grand's head off for paying in pennies.  Bless her heart.  Or a guy wanting to buy a pack of cigarettes, the only kind you haven't restocked, and he demands that he speak to the manager.

Steve.

How recursive.

We still haven't gone for that road trip to St. Louis.  I can see the chartreuse green burning all the way down that lonely highway 70 West.  We'll probably wait until Mardis Gras and let that green fairy burn our throats and warm our bellies.

Consecrated virgins stay crunchy even in milk.

Probably the most underrated Smashing Pumpkins album is Ava Adore.  Every song is a ballad to the great plethor of life and death.  Every song a tribute to suffering, love, loss, and the struggle of human emotions.  Each song is a painting.  Just like Anna's Art.

she wrote me a letter I never opened.

Nor did I give it to Steve, Steve wouldn't understand her guesture of leaving one last goodbye.

I filed it away in my notebook, and there it sits, gathering dust and sanctity.  She said she was moving.

I'm going to open it, not now, not soon, but after she's moved.  She probably wants it to be seen as her last goodbye, this note, these words.

Letter.

The other day I biked down Violin Road again.  Fall is always a time of desperation there.  The children, with glazed eyes and stolen souls wander around the streets with thin stiks for toys and mangled-snaggled dogs.  Their worn and scratchy voices screaming and shrieking in what seems their own language driven by desperation.

Desperation is one of those emotions that you can see in someone's eyes.  It hollows out the heart and leaves the eye staring blanky into nowhere.  On at least where their soul used to be.  Maybe the eyes really stare inwardly where their soul used to be..."

Cause they all drive... Killer Cars.""
     - Radiohead Killer Cars</i>

Steve came home last night while I was asleep.  He got this new job at EZ-Mart a couple of streets off the main drag and Violin Rd.  He gets off pretty late at night.  He said he was going to take off a few days and we should drive out to Ralleigh, haven't takne the T-Bird out for a road trip in ages.

It's hard to believe that we're nearly 30 years old.  We still hold onto the same dreams that we did when we were in high school, and even since we were kids.  I remember when Steve and his other friends, when I first came to Missing Mile, were building a spaceship.  Steve's last inkling of dreaming and using his imagination died when he was only 8.

Me, I'm still dreaming like nothing ever change din my life.  Death, pride, shame, and reality never really affect my ability to dream, reach for something beyond myself, or beyond this realm.

I had a friend other than Steve, way back in high school.  Absydia and I shared many things, except that I didn't know how she felt about me.  Sure I liked her, we were friend,s but she never told me that she was in love with me.  WE had grown too close at that point, and now, well, she's changed too much since she moved, grown apart.

""You can't wish for days past,
you can only find them in the looking glass.""

Someone told me that once, but I can't remember who.

Maybe if I had known, during those more impressionable years, while Miz Deliverance was still around, I would have possibly stayed.  Absydia had an inner energy, never let me get close enough for my empathy to be reliable.  I never knew she loved me.

Violin Rd. is so tragically beautiful this time of year.  The last tendrils of kudzu turning a deep russet, writhing their way through the skeleton of a '56 Chevy car.  The cottonwood flying through the air like a southern Hanami festival, with the trailer offspring chasing their calico cats with sticks instead of Japanese girls and bento boxes for accompaniment.  Piles of leaves in backyard jungles turning yellow, gold, and red like the jewel coffers of sultans and Popes shortly after the crusades, Violin children their guardsmen and knights.

""All the beauty of the world to see,
All in a place of condemnity.""

Most of Violin's still standing houses and barns are condemned, but still contain the remnents of habitability.

One night, while driving back home from a beer run there was a torrential downpour and the 'Bird broke down on Violin Rd.  Steve and I fled refuge in a condemned house, and much to our surprise there was a family still iving there, or what seeemd to be a family.  No blinking, no talking, they didn't say much and we never moved beyond the main room.  Twenty minutes later the rain let up, Steve had the car working.  It was just the way they were laying, sitting, sleeping in their piles of refuse and fading signs of life...

Violin people have this broken sadness about them, like zombies from one of those cliche horror movies.  They don't speak, they barely blink, and never once do you seem them outside Violin Rd.

That place always did give me the creeps.  Not even riding in a car were you safe from that feeling.

""Cause we all drive... Killer cars."""

"event","It's that kind of pain that chokes you down and holds you by your shoulders, like molasses with muscles.  It's the stinging sensation you feel in your jaw or your eyes when you think of that time when you, Steve, and Ann were all happy.

Yeah, it's kind of like that.

It's that kind of feeling of dead inside knowing that Ann cheated on Steve, and Steve, without saying a word, probably cheated on Ann.  But for a while they pretended they were happy, that they had some sort of symbolance of a real relationship, but I could see through the complatency that they kept to keep the peace.

I hated being the middle of things.  Coming home at night to the aftermath of a heated argument and possibly a physical fight.  This is what other kids in school probably felt when they had parents that would always fight.  A tension so electric and thick that if you walked inside it would make you dizzy, frightened, and queasy all at once.

Or when I woke up at night to find them arguing, yelling so loud I thought my head would burst, and throwing things at each other, slamming against he door, breaking the brittle metal lock that Miz Deliverance installed herself.

Yeah, it's kind of like that.

When Steve broke up with Ann and they didn't see each other, at least not in the house, it felt like I had broke up with Ann too.  I would check up on her, making sure her dad didn't drink himself to death, but I really had no connection with her other than Steve.

I really didn't want to talk to her, that summer of orange tshirts and leather flip-flops, of tea-rose perfume that she kept instead of deoderant.  It made me sentimental to think that even she had some all-natural touches, her taste in food, her hatred of Aluminum dioxide deoderants, that pore clogging substances.

Maybe it was jealousy towards Steve, for having such a unique girlfriend, that all he did was inevitably ""fuck up"" his relationship.  He'd come home that night, neither of us speaking about what happened, but I knew.  He kept saying, ""I fucked up, Ghost...""  Ann fucked up, too but she never raped Steve.

Ann had been cheating on a Prof. from a few towns away, Ralleigh, I think.  She never said, but I think it was how Steve had treated her in bed.  She would always have a mist of disappointment lingering in her eyes, that faraway look that said that she never really wanted to be there with Steve.  Some said Ann was secretly saving money to move away, away from Missing Mile, her father, and Steve.

I could never imagine leaving Missing Mile, it's the only thing I've known.

I tried to be friends with Ann, but Steve would only mock me and tsk that I was trying to be ""girly"" or ""banding against him.""  I was just trying to know Ann on my own terms, trying to get to know her before the unique fire that hid behind her eyes died out completely.

After Steve forced himself on her, there was nothing left.  She stayed most of her time locked up in her house, and after trying to visit her, and spend some time with her, I heard wind of her from another mutual friend that I was ""bothersome"" and that I was ""just getting in the way"" of what she wanted.

She cheated on Steve.

In a way, she cheated on me too."

"event","The sun lapped over the horizon, its orange yellow fingertips spreading the buttery color of dwindling day across the road, turning everything a golden, ethereal hue.  I couldn't help but notice and run my bike into the gravel on every curve, trying to keep my eyes on the ever fading golden light.

I wanted to run right into it.  To be enveloped by it.  Ride my bike off into the sunset to be taken into the feel good drops of sun, as it kissed my lips, my hair, turned my clothes and all metal the dusky reddish orange.

I rode on the metal bridge, the one with no shoulder... Someone honked for me to hurry, but I just kept looking into the sunset, as I rode slowly.

When I heard the voices, I stopped.  Those voices that speak directly into me, no one else hearing.  It's as if they speak on my ear drum.  ""Hello Ghost.""  At least this one was intelligent.  I veered off the high way and into the Oregon Trail park and sit underneath a tree.

I waited for them to talk, maybe say something more than hello.  But they didn't.  As I sat there I took a few pictures with the digital camera that Steve and I bought for our gigs.

"event","Steve said I should get on one of those '.com' sites and start a journal, so, I started one today.  Nothing really special.

The blurry figures that roam the house stole my paper journals, the ones with all the pressed flowers glued down and delicate lines drew around them.  ...I'll miss those journals.  But whatever I need the most of my writings I have glued and written firmly on my wall in Elmer's and Sharpie.

I think they also misplaced my grandma's medicinal folk-lore book.  That had some really great recipes for coughing-fits, fevers, chiggers, and wellen-bites.  I need to find the yucca-shampoo recipe.  My hair gets greasy easily.

Bought an entire case of beer this week, it'll probably be gone in two days.  Steve still doesn't have a job.  He probably won't because he thinks that Lost Souls? will go farther than it has so far.  I tend to agree with him, but not in the high-school-dazed and confused way.  I know we have limits.  Mainly, I don't think the band can stand on two members.

That's fine."

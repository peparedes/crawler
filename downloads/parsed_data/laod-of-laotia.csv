waiting on a train
i woke up in pieces
and Elisabeth dissappeared again
i wish you were inside of me
i hope that youre okay
i hope youre resting quietly
i just wanted to say

goodnight Elisabeth
goodnight Elisabeth
goodnight

we couldnt all be cowboys
so some of us are clowns
some of us are dancers on the midway
we roam from town to town
i hope that everybody
can find a little flame

and walk out on the wire once again
and i say

goodnight Elisabeth

goodnight

ill wait for you in baton rouge
ill miss you down in new orleans
ill wait for you while she slips in something comfortable
ill miss you when im slipping in between
if you wrap yourself in daffodiles
i will wrap myself in pain

"event","where do i start? do i start with the fact that last night for the first time in 6 years i threw up because of the antibiotics im taking for strep throat im not even sure i have? do i start with the fact that my car that holds so many memories was totaled by some fucking japanese lady who didnt know what a red light meant? or maybe i should just cut straight to the chase and tell you all the real reason im making this post... and tell you why theres a million things ill never be able to do again and a million places ill never be able to go again and a million songs ill never be able to listen to again because itll never be the same alone. yes, alone. me and Tash broke up yesterday. what the hell happened? God... i dont even know... its like at one point i felt like her everything, and for a month now her time for me was put in a little box and shoved into the back corner of a shelf. God, she still is my everything, but i cant live hanging on her every movement and every word and every thought just waiting for something to let me know that she feels the same way about me as she did that night in front of Rachels house in my car in the rain with Counting Crows playing where she told me she loved me for the first time. i want to have that feeling she gave me on that night in the taco bell drive through, or after hideaway, or the night after the whole Rav/Rachel incident. it fucking sucks and i know it and she knows it. but ive been fading away lately. i think Tash needs to regroup herself, and im still going to be there for her when she needs it, but this is the way it is. i told her once the dust settles when she finds out who she is and where her heart lies, ill still be here, ill still be me and i know where my heart lies and ill always be me... but i cant go on wondering if we're going to make it through another day... its tearing me up inside to the point that some days i dont even know what to do. it rained last night... they can smash up my car that we've made so many memories in... i can stay away from the music that reminds me of her... i wont be at the places we used to visit... but the rain will always fall when it wants to fall and ill always think of her and how rain was our weather. maybe when she works out things in her own life well enough that she can show love to someone else again... maybe then we can try again... but for now... for now this is what reality is and it fucking sucks

my thoughts are so chaotic right now i dont believe anyone will ever know. i have my things that i keep from everyone. i have my thoughts no one will even know about, and as much as people say they know when somethings bothering me... you wont know. when something small is bothering me ill give you i do a horrible job of not showing it... but something big... youll never know... its scary that i can make sure no one realizes something huge is bothering me. heres your only fair warning... unless i tell you directly, odds are you'll never know something this big is bothering me, not one of you, i believe, could figure it out... no matter how well you think you know me... things are just getting to be too much lately... its wearing me out... i dont know what to do anymore... i give up, i swear, im not gonna fight you anymore... just please dont start arguements... i have no fight left in me... i dont want to fight anyone... i havent the will... just... have it your way, ill find my consolation elsewhere... i always do. i find it in my guitar... i find it in food... i find it in driving... i find it in my bike... i find it in my warm bed sheets... but i cant even sleep well anymore... im worn out and none of you pay any mind to it. you just go about doing all youve been doing... wallowing in your filth... i promise i wont harp anymore, just let me be... let me find a constant in my life again... let me find at least one good heart among you all... sometimes i feel like love is a minefield, you can try to avoid them all you want, but if you dont take care of them one will blow your head off eventually. sometimes i feel like my life is a game of dodgeball with God throwing rocks from heaven, and for every one i miss someone else is down for the count. sometimes i feel like im shouting at an empty train to stop because its barreling at a cliff, no ones there to listen, all i can do is sit and watch its time tick quickly away. sometimes i feel like im walking on thin ice, you have to be kidding if you think you can step in the right place to avoid falling in, you'll never know if its safe to step on until your foot is planted on it, if its going, youre going. sometimes i really do feel like im the only one left out of a huge conspiracy. its all just some huge joke. you all tell me things and unless i see it i dont know if to believe it. one of these days you'll all just pop out from around a corner and say 'gotcha! all youve worked for these past months has been nothing more than ONE BIG SICK TWISTED JOKE.' and i can go stand on the tip of a rock on top of a mountain and wait for a strong wind to come take me home. lately it seems like it just gets 'better' and 'better.' at what point should i have realized im in over my head? anyone wanna spring anymore suprises on me? its easiest to kick a man when hes down. all's fair in love and war, and sex is just an unfathomable mystery from which we were made and to which we are drawn and our every vulnerability... the open door through which our slow pathetic demise leaks in if abused. in one heavenly moment we are floating through outer space free of the gravity of earth and free of the gravity of the situation of our lives. and then the next moment could be worked into our drug... our addiction... it screams at you 'you must have me.' it wasnt me in the first place... it could never control me the way you think it does and it never will... i just give in because i have no will to fight... i never wanna view it as your good deed... your gesture of kindness... its my privilege and your carrot to dangle in front of me. you dont know of the lonely nights i spend when you dont so much as call to let me know youre alive for days on end. some nights i dont sleep. most often i stay up till 3 or 4 am until my body cant take it anymore and theres no way my mind can keep me awake anymore so i go to bed. im wandering further and further into this darkness i need someone to give me a hand and pull me out... soon... please.

im just trying to make my way here... im just doing what i can with what ive got... to you hypocrites and liars out there, you dont know what youre messing with... there should be a place in hell for you, and God only knows there probably will be... stop trying to screw things up for those of just trying to make an honest way. i pray to God that it does come back to bite you eventually... they say you reap what you sew, i can only hold to the hope that they may be right.


you used to say live and let live
you know you did
but if this ever changing world in which we live in
makes you give in and cry
live and let die

she is trapped inside a month of grey
and they take a little everyday
she is a victim of her own responses
shackled to a heart that wants to settle
then runs away
its a sin to be fading endlessly

yeah, but shes alright with me

she is leaving on a walkaway
she is leaving me in disarray
in the absence of a place to be
she stands there looking back at me
hesitates, then turns away
she changes so easily
shes just like mercury

yeah, but shes alright with me

keep some sorrow in your hearts and minds
for the things that die before their time
for the restless and the abandon homes
the tired and weary ramblers poems
that stay beside me where i lie
shes entwined in me
crazy as can be

yeah, but shes alright with me

I can see a love restrained
darlin, when I hold you
don't you know I feel the same

nothin lasts forever

in the cold November rain

we've been through this such a long long time
just trying to kill the pain

but lovers always come
and lovers always go
and no ones sure who's letting go today
walking away

if we could take the time

I could rest my head
just knowing that you are mine
all mine

so if you want to love me

everybody needs some time
on their own

wouldnt time be out to charm you?

sometimes I need some time
all alone

I know that you can love me

going down the only road ive ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone'

-Whitesnake, Here I Go Again


so i officially dropped out of the band. i really have nothing against the rest of the band though. i didnt drop out cuz i hate them or something. i was bassist.... i dont play bass... Chief was gonna write all my parts and i would just play them. i mean, thats fine for someone else... but thats not the way i am. music for me has always been about expressing yourself, and id rather write my own parts and suck than just play something someone else wrote and be good. i just really didnt feel like i was part of the band anymore, so i dropped out. no offense to the guys though.

as for now... im a drifter, as always has been the case. im never in a group for very long... its just the way things operate in my life i guess. ive always been more of a loner than anything else. theres still Erik and Rav though... they always hang out with me no matter which group im in or drifting between. i dont have to prove myself to them or anything.

i called sierra the other night. i was just driving aimlessly so i called her from the cell phone. i havent talked to her in quite some time, i figured it was about time to give her a call. ive been meaning to for a while now, its just been too busy to have been able to talk for very long. seems things on her end are just as 'interesting' as on mine... lovely to know we're all in this hell together. life is such an enjoyable experience.

lately ive been listening to counting crows even more so. theres like a story between the first 3 cds that im kinda sorta cracking. Adam Duritz is the embodiment of genius. i cant even describe it... its just beyond anything ive ever heard. check out www.annabegins.com sometime. it has meanings for a lot of their songs and stuff... its rather interesting to read some of them. they also have the live version of the song 'august and everything after' which is the song that their first cd is named after... but its not on that cd... its not on any cd. in the back ground on the cover of the cd you can see bits and pieces of the lyrics but the song was a mystery up until he played it in concert. for now... im out

'I wanted to be honest, too, I knew what I was going to do after I lost her. I knew I would go out there and sleep with people. I would do anything to keep me from thinking about her in the middle of the night where she was with some other guy...'

drifting futher every day
getting lost within myself
nothing matters, no one else
i have lost the will to live
simply nothing more to give
there is nothing more for me
need the end to set me free

things not what they used to be
missing one inside of me
deathly lost this cant be real
cannot stand this hell i feel
emptiness is filling me
to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn
i was me, but now hes gone

now i cant think, think why i should even try

yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye
goodbye....

somethings wrong... somethings different lately. i cant put my finger on it, but something is definitely wrong. this is strange because nothing in the past has seemed to bother me beyond a point that i could take. recently, though... i just dont know... certian things have been cutting deeper. Adams funeral, for one, effected me in ways i would have never imagined. you must understand, im the kind of person who doesnt cry at funerals... like... any funeral. i really have 3 reasons why not.

1. people always give attention to anyone crying, i kinda have always had the thought that theres a lot more people that need the attention than me, i tend to deal with things myself and balance the weight of the world on my shoulders and i dont accept help with life from people... usually.
2. i got that from my mom... she doesnt cry at funerals because she has a strong personality like that... its just inherited i guess...
3. its the way i view funerals. people dying is a part of our lives, sure, you may miss them, but somehow for me that doesnt constitute crying... and it usually doesnt effect me more than one of my friends/family is gone. 

its really that third thing that worries me. in 18 years of life on this planet, nothing has had really a long term effect on me so much as to have me make certian decisions and act a certian way because of it. ever since Adams death, certian things bother me that NEVER have before. example: this one guy my sister sorta knew, Bobby, committed suicide a couple months ago, a bit after Adams death. this guy was one of those highway 100 racers with his suped up car and all, and he had a lot of friends among that group of people. my sister was telling me how a bunch of the racers got together and had decals made for their cars that said 'in memory of Bobby' or a message something like that (to be honest im not even sure about the name, thats not whats important to the story). i really thought nothing of it at the time until one day i pulled up at a stoplight and i saw a car with that decal. i couldnt even look at it... i didnt want to... it just hit me that this guy who seems all big and bad in his fixed up car was friends with this Bobby and it turned the driver of that car into a human rather than just a bodiless entity that controlled this heap of metal that im sure i at one time screamed profanities at for having cut me off or something of the like. i couldnt take it... i looked away and i waited there impatiently for the light to change because for some reason that had an effect on me that made me rather uncomfortable and in all honesty somewhat overcome with this sadness that i dont know why. life will never be the same for the driver of that car. the Bobby he used to stop at mcdonalds with to get some food before going back to racing will never be there at mcdonalds again. that Bobby he used to brag to about who he beat will never be there to hear it again. the Bobby he hung out with every saturday, the Bobby who bought him that cool birthday present, the Bobby helped him fix his car... hes gone. that will never be again. the last he saw of Bobby was the Bobby laying cold and pale in his casket and somehow as he stared at him... that wasnt the Bobby he knew. no, this driver of this car in front of me will never lead his life quite the same as in the past. his life will always be different, just a little off of what it normally was. and because of this i couldnt sit there anymore and look at that sticker... i had to leave and get away from it.

a while later this one day i had Tash over. we were hanging out in my basement and my mom called me up for something... im not sure what. but then my sister came home while i was up there and she had this card from the family another guy who recently committed suicide. his picture was on the front of it and i looked at it and right then and there i left in the middle of a sentence and went back in the basement. i couldnt look at the picture. i couldnt handle it.

this all worries me.... NOTHING before has ever had that kind of effect on me... never.... never has anything done that to me... why all of a sudden?

this is just one example and ive suddendly become too sarcastic and pessimistic to care enough to type the rest of what i was gonna say out.

i leave for kc tomorrow, which in my terms would be the day after tomorrow cuz i still see it as late saturday night right now, but in reality its tomorrow. im not ready for the contest. i havent practiced like i should have. im not gonna be ready. ah well i guess... im starting to think itll be a much needed break from my life rather than a tedious week apart from my friends. i swear to god the whole world is having their period right now... like, guys included. everyones just bitching bitching bitching... at me none the less. maybe you'll all have wrapped it up by the time i get back or something.

apparently ive become too 'emo'. apparently emo includes listening to lynyrd skynyrd and guns and roses, too. apparently liking the rain makes you emo. dude, the rain was my fucking weather before emo was even around. i guess saying stupid phrases makes me emo too. like thats something i havent done all along, right? what it all stems back to is i have a girlfriend now and apparently thats not allowed cuz that makes you emo. am i acting different? maybe. have i changed? no. its not that im acting different because ive changed and that which was me is me no more. im just more... reserved lately. all i do all day is sit around on my ass until my parents order me to [mow the lawn/fix the computer/take the car for an oil change/wash my grandmas windows/whatever else] and then when i wanna go anywhere i argue with them for a couple hours in which they tell me i do nothing around the house and then they dont let me go. excuse me for not jumping for joy at the thought of spending my whole fucking summer this way. ive told you all i hate summer before and thats because summers are progressively starting to suck more and more... this one being a prime example of this. besides all this theres just shit after shit piling up for me to get done with a deadline and its just worry about this worry about that fucking worry until you cant think of anything else. nationals will be over soon and i may get a job and that will be fixed. then all i need is a worry free night out on the town and ill be back to normal, i swear to you. but for now..... its summer and ive slept in a total of 2 days so far and im fucking worn out... im sorry if im just a tad overworked and underpaid and tired out of my mind... its a phase... i hope... once i start getting the normal summer 12 hours of sleep a day i should be fine too... i think... whatever man... i know everyones still thinking 'yeah fucking right' so im im not sure why i went through the trouble of typing that all out at nearly 4 am, but if you do read it... just listen to me... i know this shit... ive been worn out before all i need is a night out with the guys and a night to sleep from 2 am to 3 pm. i know what im talking about. for now... i have to get up again in 3 more hours and im going to be fucking tired and im going to bed to lay under my warm blankets for the best 3 hours of my day...

alright, i got that out of my system




her eyes were closed and she was sleeping

her eyes were closed and i stared at her

God, im so in love with this girl... i wonder if she knows...

she wasnt feeling good i guess... it had been a long day...

i ran through wet bushes and trees and grass and trails to find her... i ran like mad and i was wet when i was done... i was wet and pretty gross... i really had to get out of those clothes anyway... was i worried? i couldnt find her... i figured shed was ok... was i worried? we looked all over, we did... we couldnt find them... shes a smart girl, she'll find the car... was i worried? i suppose the remote possibility of something bad happening had crossed my mind, but it was a park in the middle of hales corners. shed be fine... i was still wet from running through the trails though. yeah, it was fun to sneak around behind them and scare them like that... but at some point i did just want to run up and throw my arms around her..... i think i was too wet and gross though. ah well... i still enjoyed putting my arms around her... i think she did to

we were in the car alone... her eyes were closed... she didnt feel good.... it was a long day, i couldnt blame her... her eyes were closed and she was sleeping... God... i just watched her sleep... i am so in love with this girl... i could have watched her for hours but it was only minutes... her eyes were closed, but mine were on her the whole time... ill watch you while you sleep... ill watch you and take care of you... ill watch you because i love staring at you

God... im so in love with this girl... i wonder if she knows...

i slept on the floor... no, i wasnt really asleep... i knew it would be akward and i told everyone and i told them it was a bad idea and i washed my hands clean of it.... i told them, but no one ever listens to me anyway... i told them... i get no respect from anyone in my life... meh... thats the way it goes... i wasnt sleeping... i was pretending to sleep to get away from the akward mess... i wasnt sleeping..... i was thinking about her... i meant to tell her later, but i was thinking about her the whole time... i wasnt sleeping... she came over and kissed my cheek, thats what i was waiting for the whole time i was on that floor... sure i was tired, but i wasnt sleeping... i was laying there pretending to sleep thinking about you, not much unalike my own bed... i laid there and waiting for her to come and lay there with me... i laid there and she laid next to me... and i was happy... it may not have seemed that way, but i was happy

she makes me happy... she really does

i kinda thought it was a bad idea to sneak in. but was much the opposite. it was late and we snuck in. it was late and everyone else was sleeping... we were in bed.... it was late and we were in bed, but we werent sleeping... everyone else was sleeping... but we werent sleeping... 'we should do this again, laying in bed next to each other like this'... it was raining and we were singing counting crows to each other... God, im so in love with this girl... i think she knows... i dont know if she knows how much, but she knows... aww, babe, i love you... she cried a little, but its not cuz it was bad... she laid next to me and i am in love with this girl... the moment was perfect... the whole night was perfect... and you walk around and see these people and look at their face and their eyes scream 'im not a virgin anymore' and their eyes scream 'im up for it with anyone' and they dont mean too... and you look at these people... 'im not a virgin anymore'... and im not a virgin anymore... not everyone gets it... theyre not a virgin anymore and they dont get it... theyre dirty and 'easy' and theyre always up for it... they dont get it... it wasnt dirty... we laid there and the rain fell and there was lightning and i told her i loved her and it wasnt shallow... and she knew it... and i wasnt shallow... and she wasnt shallow... and this was deeper than us... this moment was deeper than the sleeping world around us... and, oh, i would have slept if i could have... i would have slept because she was there and nothing else mattered... and i would have slept, and she would have slept, and the world was already sleeping and we just needed to catch up and lay there in each others arms and sleep... some day... some how... in a perfect world it all works out... but i was happy... and im so in love with this girl, and she knows"

what a fucking night. i love my life... i love irony... so went out with the guys tonight and Ryan (Senator) was driving and he blows his tire. so we start back toward my house but its down to the rim pretty far away so he pulls over(keep in mind its raining and cold the whole night). irony #1: just last week Ryan lost the key to his trunk, and there is no trunk release inside his car. so we decide to take the back seat out to get the spare tire out through there. well the bolts are too tight to get off by fingers so i call my mom to bring me my tools. just before she gets there Brandon shows up in his car. then my mom gives my my tools, we take the seat off no problem. we start getting the shit out and all. irony #2: the spare tire doesnt fit through the hole where the seat was. so finally Brandon says lets just use his spare. well so i lay down on the dirty cold wet pavement and jack the car part way up and break loose the nuts, star pattern of course. then i jack it the rest of the way up and take off the nuts and remove the tire and rim. irony #3: Brandon's spare doesnt fit. i kinda had a feeling it wouldnt, but i tried to hope for the best. at this point i screamed fuck a few times pretty loud then proceeded to plan my next move. after a few wild ideas were thrown about i decide theres nothing to it, we're getting the fucking trunk open. now, Ryan had already tried opening it from the inside and outside without a key and got no where, so no one was expecting much. i go in there, take a screw driver, no more than 3 minutes pass and i pop the trunk open and scream 'i am god.' so we get the spare out and i put it on while Brandon, Chrissay, and Cheif leave to prank this kids house. they cant find the house so they come back. we had the spare on by the time they got back and they want me to show them where the house is. neither me nor Ryan want to go pranking, we just wanna go home. so finally we agree that theyll follow us, ill point at the house when we go past, they can have their fun, me and Ryan go home. well we take off and Ryan messed up and turned down a service road so they go ahead and they had to wait. well we catch up but we passed them so we had to turn around and we come back but they left to catch up with us already, so when we turn we were going a bit too fast and those spares arent made for much so the wall on the spare completely caves in and now we have a record 2 blown tires in one night. Ryan calls his dad and i decide to wait with him until his dad gets there and Brandon takes Chris and Chief home. me and Ryan are waiting and he keeps saying hes thirsty so im like 'theres a resteruant down the road, we can walk.' so we do. he gets some water... i was so hungry, i got some pie. it was good pie. i ate this pie with my fingers cuz i didnt have a fork. i had just laid on the ground and changed a tire with these fingers. i had not washed these fingers. it was good pie. Ryans dad was there when we got back and he called triple a, Brandon pulls up after having dropped the guys off and i ask him for a ride home cuz he doesnt live far from me. he takes me home. here i am, cold, wet, hungry, dirty, and wearing nothing but boxers and a sweatshit, because my clothes are soaking wet. i love my life. i told Tash to call me at 11:30. i had expected to be back by 11 at latest so i didnt bring the cell phone. i was back at midnight. i missed Tash's call. after tonight there is nothing i wanted more at this point than to sit back and talk to Tash and sip hot chocolate. i have no hot chocolate right now. i missed Tash's call...

-Piebald, Still We Let It Choke Us


ive been working like mad lately on basically everything. projects at home and school stuff... i dont know why. i kinda dont mind doing all the manual labor. i took down our 18 year old swing set. just to give a little insight into what that was like, i got to pulling the ladder for the slide out of the ground and my dad looks at it and says 'you know one of the steps is under there, right?' i had to cut all the pieces into 4ft lengths or shorter too... with a hacksaw, mind you. ah well... like i said, i dont mind the manual labor. it doesnt take much brains so i just put on some music and i have a lot of thinking time. last week was a full week, i need my thinking time... reflecting time. i tend to find myself struggling with questions... looking for answers, and you know, no one can give them to you... you have to find them yourself. i dont know... since a week before last friday so many things have happened that my head is spinning. that friday was one of the coolest days of my life... and also it worried me. there was things me and Tash talked about after school that worried me... but it got better. we went to the lakefront and just talked for a long time... and it was amazing. i didnt want that day to end, ever. i didnt think that feeling could be topped. saturday came. saturday i will regaurd as quite possibly the day i experienced the best feeling of my life. and to be honest, it has me worried that i may never experience anything like that again. could anything live up to it, or have i reached my pinnacle? is it all downhill from here on in? saturday... saturday was a full day. saturday i cut the grass first thing in the morning. saturday i finally cleaned my car in the afternoon (2 hours at least). saturday Tash called me to visit her at Rachels cuz my good man Trent was there. i havent seen Trent since God knows when. i pulled up at Rachels finally and Tash gave me quite a warm greeting. then Trent came out and jumped on me and started humping me... weird, but its Trent, hes a good guy. i met Al. Al enjoys food. Al is a good man. we hung out in Rachels room for some time then drove. we drove to Node, a cafe downtown. the place was packed so me and Trent sat outside. the rest joined us soon thereafter. i was hungry so i asked Trent if he wanted to go across the street to Open Pantry. he said alright and we started off. then everyone just followed. i walked in and Tash saw some stuffed animals and said 'get me one of these!' just messing around. and we walked past the condoms just then and i couldnt resist the moment so i said 'how about i get you one of those?' she said it would be funny if i bought them and akward. little did she know that the summer after 8th grade partly consisted of doing funny things with condoms and me and Sam were always the two brave enough to buy them so it doesnt really bother me or anything. it became apparent that she was entirely scared of them by the fact that she wouldnt touch them so i told her id buy them but she had to put them in my hand. and she had to stand next to me so everyone knew she was my girlfriend when i bought them. i left them at the top of my pile of stuff when i got in line and that was nice and akward, it was fun. we then headed down to the lakefront. the lakefront is 1 of two places where me and Tash really seem to live... we exist in these places... we ARE in these places. nothing is ever wrong there... and nothing ever will be. our little chunk of heaven on this God forsaken planet. so we went out on the rocks and talked. we talked about the thing that worried me on friday. Tash told me she'd get through it cuz she had me and we love each other. that meant the world and more to me. that will live on in my memory for all my life. and it may seem like a silly thing to you, but it meant something to me... to feel needed... to feel helpful... to feel important in another persons life... its a feeling no one should ever miss. then we talked about the fact that Tash's mom thought me and Tash were having sex. this in itself is irony, cuz we had done nothing even relatively close to sex. Tash said she talked to her friend about it, and her friend asked her if she wanted to have sex and they talked about it for a while and her friend asked her questions to see if she was ready for it and Tash was telling me about this and she finished with 'Matt, you fit the job perfectly.' this is #2. 2nd time that night i felt special for one reason or another. i felt i must have been doing something right for once in my life. i got the blanket out of my car and we cuddled up for a while looking at the lake and the sky and the stars talking. soon we had to leave to take Al home and i called home and bought myself all the time in the world to stay out. me, Tash, Trent, and Rachel headed back to Rachels. me and Trent tried religiously to start a bon fire with soaking wet logs without any starter other than the lighters in our pockets and some office paper. needless to say we werent very successful. Rachel wanted to get on top of the garage and i said i could get up. so i did. i ran, jumped, pulled... i was up. a joint effort between me and Trent got Rachel and Tash up and then Trent came up. there we sat and played a game of truth or dare that basically the biggest outcome was me sitting under a blanket with Tash in my boxers. we went in the house and watched part of signs and played some more truth or dare in which nothing really all that big happened and we left to get taco bell... in two cars. me and Tash in mine, Trent and Rachel in Trents. Tash wanted to talk... so we talked. she told me shes been thinking. she told me she thought about things with us and about how her mom thought we were having sex. she said she thought about sex. she told me she was ready. she told me she wanted to share herself with me. and in the most mature way ive ever seen the subject approached, she asked me for my opinion and told me more on hers. we talked for quite some time about it... you must understand at 12:30 the taco bell drive through in bay view is like a half hour long. we had plenty of time. we talked about it, and we agreed we were both ready... and you know what... for once in my life sex didnt seem dirty... it seemed like love... it seemed like something above and beyond us and everything and everyone around us. i once talked to a girl about her first time having sex with her boyfriend and she referred to it as 'making love.' at which point i said that was a term my grandmother would use. and she explained to me how it wasnt just sex as we see sex on tv and as we see sex in cheesy pornos and as we hear about sex being dirty... she explained it was making love... and i accepted it but i didnt understand it. and at this moment in time on that saturday night i understood, and i knew what she meant. the way we talked and the way the night went... there was trust... there was the feeling of two lives running together to form one, and i trusted her with me... all of me, physically and otherwise... and she trust me with herself in the same way... and it wasnt so much the surface that mattered... it wasnt about sex... we've gone thus far without it just fine... it was about how we felt about each other and it was about how in that moment a clear view had been put into my life that was always otherwise clouded. and we got our food and parked in a spot next to Trent and Rachel. we never ate our food. we talked. we talked on and on and on. and we talked about how we felt on this subject of sex. and lets think here ladies and gentlemen, we just get done talking about how we're ready for sex... we're sitting in a car alone in an empty parking lot in the dark at 1 am and what would you expect to come next? and what did we do? we kissed. and that was alright. and that was cool, because it wasnt about having sex... it was about the trust we had in each other and about how we both loved each other enough for sex... but we didnt have to prove it by having sex... no... we kissed... and i wouldnt have traded that for the world, ladies and gentlemen.... i wouldnt have traded that for anything. and thats basically all we did that night. we kissed. and i was happy. and this, friends, is the good stuff. this is what love is made of and this is what we spend our lives looking for and this is why we wake up every morning every day to a job or school we hate and this is why we go through so much and yet still live on... and this, friends... this was the moment in which i was happy, truely happy... and nothing else existed, and no one else existed... there was no world around us, there were no people and there was no consequences... and we didnt have to worry about them anyway, because we kissed... yes friends... we kissed.
the night ended eventually, as was bound to happen. and i went Trents for a while and then home. home to my life. home where there wasnt two lives led as one. home where i was alone in my bed and i slept. that, friends, was MY saturday night... no... that was OUR saturday night.

since then... since then nothing has proved to me that anything ever will reach that pinnacle again... but since then nothing has proven it will go downhill either. monday and wednesday were spent at mine and Tash's other place... whitnall park... the most beautiful park youll find in the middle of our city here... our other piece of heaven spared for us by the gods. in the secluded trails of whitnall park no one else exists... and i wouldnt have it any other way. the saturday to come would be our 2 month anniversary. friday Tash came to school crying. thursday her mom told her she couldnt hang out with Rachel anymore and she couldnt see me anymore. i held her as she cried the rest of the morning and i told her we'd figure things out eventually and everything would be alright. we went to first hour and by the time that was over she was feeling better. i dont know... we'll be alright... it just may make hanging out hard for a bit... ill update that as is needed.

what a night was last night. i have so much on my mind... but... good stuff... but... thought provoking. eh... i guess not all of it is good. i guess thats what a night by the lakefront will do to you. i just... im so confused. my life is rushing by me so fast i have to grab a hold of it. i got home at 4 am last night. 4 hours later i got up and got in the shower and got ready for church. we headed off and i was getting sick of my brother putting crap on the radio so i stole the remote from him and controlled it myself. i went to the mix and they kept playing shit from like 3-4 years ago and i was looking out the window and thinking with edwin mcain and lifehouse playing and it was just... i dont know... its like life was right there before me, all of it. my young life... and my life now... and what life could be... and i just... i was so confused and... whats going on... you know? what the hell is going on? you see... i attribute this to last night... actually i attribute this to all last week building up into last night. but mainly though... last night... it was one of those nights that seemed to last forever just because so much was packed into so little time in retrospect. i saw Trent last night for the first time in.... a long ass time. it was cool hangin out with him again. it was at Rachels. Tash was there, and of course Rachel was there and this Al guy. he was pretty cool. he was all about the food so he cant be half bad.  the real fun picked up when we went to the lakefront. me and Tash sat on a rock and talked... about life and... just... things. so many things that it left my thoughts scatted about. we dropped Al off and went back to Rachels, where we played truth or dare on top of her garage. we went to taco bell in seperate cars, me and Tash in mine, Rachel and Trent in Trents. we... had quite the talk... and things, are looking up. now i suppose that very statement would sound extremely vain for those of you who know the whole story... but its not like that... its like.... things are looking up, because me and Tash... we're just.... i find we have more between us everytime we hang out... like we're so much closer. i dont know... my thoughts are still strewn about, and it doesnt help that im not really telling the whole story here... pfft... if i have time ill try to make it more clear. for now i eat....

"event","i have a lot on my mind right now. just... thinking about life and things. i just registered for the draft. ive already said, if a big enough war did break out i wouldnt wait for the draft... id be over there living the life of a soldier from the start. i kinda wish i had been a part of WW2. to be there on d-day... its just something thats bigger than what were are, and where we are, and these vain lives we live, and the simple things we take for granted, and all these things we see as problems. just to be there to understand how we are all part of something bigger than our own comprehension. to make my peace with God, then charge into harms way with a loaded rifle and 3 of my newest closest buddies all with the will in our heart to defend our country, because somewhere back there is someone we know and care about. we have our weapon and our honor and our beliefs that we're so passionate about our cause for once, than we will kill for it, and we will die for it. and be part of something so big it will be taught by people who carry the title 'professor' and it will be learned about by everyone from every corner of earth for the rest of this planets time... and to think to yourself, i am a part of this. this is my cause, this is my war, these are the things i have done for my own honor, and for my country, and for the overall good, and for that special girl i left behind at home... waiting with apprehension for any word or news about you. and to come home a hero, with a heros greeting, and for once you know for sure you fought the good fight, and a nation of people agree with you so much to gather around the streets than you walk on. you all can go on protesting the war, but i happen to believe that killing thousands of our people doing their jobs and living their lives in 2 of our tallest towers constitutes a little bit of whoop ass. and our soldiers will hunt down these people into the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and the caves and the seas. and if need be, i will go out there, and i will hunt them down wherever they run. and i will hunt them down so next time you go to work, next time you go on vacation, next time you kiss your lover goodbye on their way out to work, you will know that not a soul will touch you, or them, or anyone. and that will be my reward, that will be my fill, and i will come home and live my life again. and i will come home, and i will greet all those i care about and i havent seen in a year and it will be one of the greatest moments of my life. yes, ladies and gentlemen, i am registered for the draft.

i was talking to Tash about this today. its seemingly a real possibility. i had to be registered by today (30 days from my 18th birthday) by law, so i left a sticky note in my car that said 'register for draft.' Tash crumbled it up and threw it in back. she doesnt want me to. she wouldnt want me going to war. i guess thats understandable. i cant assure her id be safe there. somehow ive always had the mentality that im somehow invincible. and i kinda feel like death is a weakness, and i hate having weaknesses... its hard to explain, its the way i am. but i cant tell her if i went to war id be alright and id come back safely. she asked me what id say to her if i did get drafted. i didnt really think about it at first... it was kinda a light-hearted conversation... and i said 'ill say ill write you every day and ill be back in 2 years.' she kinda gave me a look of dissapproval, and i thought for a second and i said 'Tash, if i get drafted, i think id ask you to marry me.' and she kinda looked at me and we talked a little about it in kind of a flippant manner, and then she said 'but the question is, would I marry you?' and i said 'well, what is the answer to that question?' and she kinda shrugged and didnt really say anything. it was still kinda a light conversation. then she leaned over and threw her arms around me and kissed me and said 'I would be honored to marry you.' alright, i guess this is sounding a bit weird, but it was just a conversation we had... ya know, im not crazy insane married-by-the-time-im-18 or anything. but it hit us both, that me getting drafted was a definite possibility, and that the whole idea of getting married before i left for war wouldnt be entirely abstract of an idea. we kinda went off on the tangent of what that would be like to be married this young and it was kind of a weird conversation, but it was fun... somehow... just the fact that it could happen and if it did it would be soon. you talk about marriage and you mean a while from now. if this happened it would be like... she would look as i know her now, and i would look as i am now... and it really wouldnt be that far off. we think of marraige and we try to picture our boyfriend or girlfriend as they would look 7... 8... 9 years from now in their mid twenties. this would be like slap a tux on me and a dress on her and thats how we'd look. it kinda... almost scared me... for a bit... but i dont know... it was a weird conversation. no, friends, im not getting married anytime soon... but you know... its not that wild of a thought that i could go to war... and its not unheard of of getting married before leaving for war. i dont know... im not crazy, i swear. theres other things on my mind, but this one is the most pleasant thought, and though its so unreal of an idea, im allowed by aloud day dreaming with Tash, guys. for now, im out

"event","so yesterday was a day filled to its brim. i was worried about hideaway all day. i kept telling Ryan exactly how much time was left before hideaway. i really didnt pay much attention in any classes and i didnt eat much either. you see, im usually not nervous... about anything. but considering last year (if you werent there or havent heard... too bad), there was a little preminition surrounding it, and besides that, the Counting Crows song (Sullivan Street) is kinda special to me and Tash, and i had it all planned out so well and it HAD to work or id be heart broken with all the time i put into practicing that song. so maybe its still not understandable for most of you why i was so worried about it, but if you find yourself in the position with the exact thought processes i had going on, tell me how you feel. so went most of the day. but then came 8th hour. anyone who was part of hideaway had to go to a meeting in the auditorium during 8th hour. so we're up there and Mr F left some student council girls in charge of everyone. so needless to say, it was no more than chaos. all of a sudden the lights go off. my first thought was this was a ploy to get our attention, but then we realized all the emergency lights came on. i looked over to the exit and i could see light coming in through there so i thought maybe it was just the auditoriums lights that went out. someone suggested that it was the light from outside, but that exit goes to the main lobby, i didnt think light would come that far in from outside. we sat around and enjoyed the darkness for a while then me and Cheif decided to go get our yearbooks while we waited. we headed for the exit and when we got there we realized the light shining in was just another emergency light, and all the halls were completely dark. there was a certain level of chaos, for teachers lost their control over select students, who had taken to wandering the halls aimlessly. picture the school entirely dark except for a very few emergency lights in the halls, and people aimlessly wandering. add to that that there was a storm brewing outside and the sky was completely grey. it was, as Cheif had said, like zombies roaming the halls. we got in line and got our yearbooks, then headed back so that Ryan and Chris could go get theirs. we just walked around the auditorium a bit, and left a couple times as we pleased, even though the administration was trying to bring back order, we snuck around them. it was actually really cool. remember, of course, i love the dark. eventually school ended, and a few minutes later the power came back on (which was curious, i thought... how well timed it was.......) and i talked to Tash a bit, then me and the guys went to Cheifs to practice. and that we did. alot. we practiced a bunch. then just me and Ryan practiced a lot more. then we ate a little something, and Chief made me some green tea so my throat, considering it was then less than 4 hours before id be singing in front of the masses. we practiced some more. alright, if you ever listen to 'Sullivan Street' theres this part toward the end where it goes 'its almost everything I need' but he holds 'need' out for a long time... well, relatively. but i had practiced this song so much that i probably could have held it longer than he does... but irrelevant, i could hit and hold the note and i thought of that as helping a little toward a good performance. so we practiced and practiced, and we all needed a little break, so Ryan was saying he wanted to spike his hair, so we went and got gel and yours truely went about doing his hair for him. the gel sucked though, so we got so far and they were kinda loose and curving over because the hair was too heavy for the gel so he just wore a hat. and we went back and practiced some more. then we left and showed up 'fashionably' late. we were on real soon after getting there, so we didnt get any more practice time. we get on stage, Ryan and Cheif test the bass and guitar, everythings fine. i step up to the mic, Ryan starts playing, Cheif cuts in with the bass, Chris cuts in with the drums. finally my part comes and i start singing and it doesnt come out the speaker at first. finally it cuts in. then i realized, theres no guitar or bass, the speakers cut out. it just threw me off a little and i forgot a line or two, i just waited for the refrain and started singing again. drums and vocals... that was the song. somehow by the grace of God i never lost my place, even though i was going by the drums. i play guitar, when i sing a song i listen for the guitar for when i sing. but like i said, somehow i got it off the drums. the whole song the mic kept cutting in and out. well i get off the stage for them to do the instrumental we came up with. and everything works fine. people liked it. while they were playing it i was talking to Dan Weiland, who was organizing the stuff, and he asks if we have another song. i said me and Ryan had our song, and he asks if we can go later. i told him that was alright, when i was really thinking that was perfect, cuz i had more time to practice then. so the song ends, and i call them all off the stage. everyones pissed cuz of all the time we spent practicing and the equipment went to hell on us. so Cheif arranges for us to play the Vines song again. we talk it over and me and Chris agreed that we didnt want to do it again. i wanted to just practice the Crows song a little more cuz i wanted it to be perfect, or damn near. so we agree. me and Ryan go and practice some more. then we go back to the backstage area and Tash comes in. i seriously thought she wouldve hated that first song cuz of all that went wrong and my singing was a little off cuz the whole speaker thing really threw everything about my performance off. well i guess it was cool. so we hung out for a while. and she told me if i sing that Counting Crows song she'll probably cry... but not in a bad way... and i knew what she meant and it just made me feel a lot better about the whole thing and more determined. so we practiced some more, and we kept asking Dan when we could go on, and he'd tell us later. and wed practice some more, and id hang out with Tash some more, and wed ask Dan, and hed tell us later. and finally Tash was saying she needed to be home and so we asked Dan and finally hes like 'i dont know that we'll even be able to fit you in' (some people took up more than their allotted time........) and so finally i regretfully gave up. i had it all planned out. and i practiced my ass off. and i was going to dedicate it to Tash and sing my heart out.... and.... meh... i was really kinda bummed, but i guess thats life. so went my night of hideaway. all the other lapsed time... ill indulge you with some other time. for now... im in need of a hot shower and some food. but for now, since i didnt get to sing it at hideaway, i leave you with Sullivan Street by the Counting Crows. so Tash, this ones for you...

take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
cross the water, home through the town
past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet
pretty soon now, I wont come around

I'm almost drowning in her seas
shes nearly fallen to her knees

take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
where all the bodies hang on the air
she remembers, she hides it whenever we meet
either way now, I dont really care
cuz I'm gone from there

I'm almost drowning in her seas
shes nearly crawling on her knees

shes down on her knees
down on her knees

take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
where I'm just another rider burned to the ground
come tumbling down

I'm almost drowning in her seas
shes nearly crawling on her knees
its almost everything I need

I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees
I'm down on, down on my knees
I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees
-Counting Crows, Sullivan Street

for you Tash, always for you"

"event","yes, 20 hours until hideaway. i was like flipping out this morning but after tonights practice im feelin a little better about it. not nearly where i should be at to be performing, but im feelin better about it. im still hella worried man. anyway, for those of you who want to come, with the band we're playing 'Ride' by The Vines, and me and Ryan are playing 'Sullivan Street' by the Counting Crows... thats the one im worried about. Counting Crows songs tend to center around the vocals.... ie, me. such is life i guess. ill tell you how it went tomorrow if it hasnt crashed and burned and im too down to write on here. until then...

"event","well, the results are in for the drafting competition. after 8 long hours of drawing in front of a computer screen, heres how it turned out... that was a hard competition. i wouldnt have figured it to take until 4 pm.... little after 4 maybe. half hour lunch break. that contest made me so hungry. and then all the computer troubles and all... and.... alright, i spose you want to know the outcome. well youre reading the journal of the number 1 high school drafter in the state of wisconsin. yeah... i took first. Scott took second. Dan accidentally deleted one of his drawings, but hes a smart kid, ill bet he couldve placed too if not for that. Pete got third in the architectual drafting contest. im not sure how any of the other guys did yet though. anyway, this is my update on life for now... or at least my update on the contest, life is a whole nuther story. maybe ill put something later about that... no... i probably wont... dont listen to me. im out

"event","so i had an interesting revelation last night while in the shower. you see, yesterday was a shit ass day. i mean hella bad. its the worst day ive had in a looong time. you know how when you have a bad day, people say you woke up on the wrong side of the bed? well i was thinking about this in the shower last night... because shower is thinking time... it doesnt exactly take all 10% (yes ten) of my brain to wash myself, so i think about things, school, music, love.... life in general. so i was thinking and you see, yesterday started out with a moth. this moth was buzzing around my head at 2am, namely up against the headboard so that its buzzing was amplified because the thing seemingly couldnt fly without smashing into the headboard. well after having woke me up many times over the period of an hour because the thing decided to make its permamnent hang out spot my headboard, i turned the light on and tried to kill it. it was the biggest moth ive ever seen in my life. it landed on my clock... so i clocked it... with my stereo remote (the nearest hard swingable object... it made sense at 3am). so the thing goes entirely ape shit cuz it was so huge that i didnt kill it, and it flies all over the place. so i couldnt get a good shot in. finally the thing flies behind my desk and silence falls. a silences that lasted an awful lot longer than i would have wished because i sat there waiting for it to come out and searching for it. never found it. eventually i realized that id be waking up in a little over an hour so i wanted to just get to bed. well i didnt wanna be woken up anymore so my bright idea was, if this thing likes my headboard so much, why dont i switch my pillow to the foot of the bed, move my blankets to the other side, and sleep the other way around. and yes, it worked, i slept my remaining hour like that. wait.... did you catch it? it took me until last night in the shower to catch this. ive never been superstitious, and i still believe this is no more than a coincidence, but its kinda weird anyway. my way to fix the moth problem was to flip around on the bed, so in essence.... i woke up on the wrong side of the bed. i thought that was weird.

anyway... enough for story time. its time to get back to the real world.

so that contest was today. got to school at 5:50am cst. 6:15 we loaded up the vans and headed for madison. got there roughly 7:45, set up, and got ready for the contest. one 'minor' problem... the computers didnt work... why? meh... its more than i care to explain right now and its all a bunch of technical blah dee dah that im sure no one cares to read right now... irrelevant... they didnt work. well we took the written test part, handed it in, and sat down and waited. for what? God, maybe? i dont know... but we waited because there was nothing else we could do. all the while everyone else has started their drawings. finally i go to find Mr Westphal, whos checking in on the people in the other contests from our school. didnt find him, but maybe thats cuz when i returned he was already back by Scott and Dan in the drafting section where i was supposed to be. he gave us these laptops that the place was letting us borrow for the contest. they had an entirely different version of autocad and it took me the first hour of the contest just to get used to it. i never really did entirely get the hang of it, but i got it good enough to deal with it. other people were finishing real fast right after lunch. Dan finished at about 3. me and Scott finally got done at about 4, and one kid finished about 15 minutes after us. it was tedious. my brain is fried. im not sure how well i really did... i wouldnt get my hopes up. i didnt even do the last drawing, which was a 3D assembly drawing, cuz the computers they gave us didnt have solid works, and i wouldnt have been able to get a 3D drawing done on autocad in the time they gave us. sounds like some others didnt do so well either though, but still... if i place at all, ill be surprised.... astounded is maybe more of the word im searching for. i didnt do nearly as well as i had hoped, especially with the different equipment. meh, awards are tomorrow in madison but im not going. ill let you know when i find out how i did. 8am-4pm... 8 hours of straight drafting with no more than 30 minutes for lunch. i have a slight headache, and im eatting everything i can get my hands on. that lunch wasnt enough. i went to tacobell and mcdonalds on the way home, then i ate the steak my mom made for din din. oh man... im really thirsty right about now and i really have no more to say because ::offset .25::all fillets and rounds r.3::positional tolerance .003 of datum A::tap and drill 10-24 UNC .367 deep with .4 counterbore .25 deep:: and the like took up my whole day. i assure you, you dont even want to hear about the details, and odds are they probably wouldnt make much sense for you anyway. crazy drafters and crazy drafting lingo. im getting in the shower... well... after i get something to drink. for now...

this day sucked so bad... im completely stressed out about numerous things, including many reports, that huge drafting contest in madison tomorrow that im realizing im totally unprepared for, the computer still has stuff that needs to be put back on, and hideaway is in one week. i dont know but i may have to drop hideaway. i dont think i can do it. its becoming too much too fast. me and Ryan know our song pretty well, we just have to practice it together. but Cheif is asking me to learn 2 songs ive never heard, plus he wants to write our own song all for hideaway. this is not going to work. besides all this i saw Tash last friday, then saturday i talked to her for about 10 minutes on the phone and not at all yesterday. today the vocal exchanges we made could be counted on ones hands. no hugs.... no kisses..... i dont see her again till thursday because tomorrow is the drafting contest and wednesday she has some biology field trip. a moth kept me up all night last night by flying into my head board and making loud noises. at very most i slept 2 and a half hours last night. i burned the pizza bagels i made when i got home that were to be my last hope for something good in this day. i was trying to sleep on the couch and i got yelled at for leaving my jacket on the counter. im out of washer fluid so i had to pull over on the road this morning to scrape the frost off of my windshield. i made a huge long post earlier that got deleted when i clicked the wrong button. the list goes on and on. what DIDNT go wrong today? someone find me some good that i could yet squeeze out of this day. it looks like its going to be a long week....

see, the thing that caught my eye was everyones had 'i' as the number one most used word. are we really all that vain... i guess it is a journal, and thus, about our lives, but still... i havent seen one yet that 'i' isnt the top, if you find one tell me. i thought that was interesting in its own special way. the other things that caught my attention on my own are #25 'like'... i told you i had to get off saying that. #37-38... 'but fucking' thought i spose but is spelled wrong. #54 seems to imply im not entirely vain. i spose really the only other weird one is #94.... '2'? what the hell? why 2? meh... so it happens... i really have no more to say right now so i guess this was rather pointless, but whatever man... take it as it is"

"event","457 peak minutes on the cell phone... yep, ladies and gentlemen, i no longer have a cell phone. the bill was $84 over between me and my sister so we have to split the $84 and i dont have a cell phone anymore. the real kicker here, my dear friends, i barely call people on it. theres a select few who refuse to call my house phone when im home, but call my cell. well guys, looks like you call the house from now on.

169 miles. the total mileage i put on the car while hanging out with Tash over the period of Mon-Wednesday. i no longer can use the car other than to drive to school and to drive home from school. plans for this weekend are pending...

other matters... this post is going to be rather sarcastic and possibly angry or depressing, one of the two, i have to pre-warn you for this but i have no apologies, i say what i feel needs being said and if you want to read it its your choice, its like an unwritten waiver. i refuse to pay for something i said that you didnt like

so as i was saying...

i have to start with talking about those 'my antidrug is ______' commercials. fuck you. fuck you to those who made those commercials. if a friend was in trouble, would you help them? i dont know... seems like an obvious question with an even more obvious answer, doesnt it. no... no i wouldnt fucking help a friend. no one wants it. you pictured them as drowning... they picture themselves as floating. no, im not helping... im controlling, arent i? you commercials get a huge fuck you. i cant even stand to watch them. i literally have to change the channel or walk out of the room, they just hit a nerve in the worst kind of way. they make me feel like such an asshole that my friends are still stoners. they show me how fucked up things really are. this is the life we live. no... standing on that dock i walk away while they drown, and you fucking commercails have to fucking pour salt over the wound. it makes me sick to watch those.

next, tobacco companies along with whoever invented cigarettes get a big mother fucking fuck you for corrupting my girlfriend. for corrupting my friends at that. you know, just for corrupting the better portion of todays youth, you get a massive fuck you. what good have you brought into the world? how can you sleep at night? it troubles me that someone can make a fortune off selling items that kill people in the worst kind of ways and still live with themselves. youve brought nothing of value to our society. youre like a disease. you spread and kill and corrupt as you go. and you sit atop your mounds of money and lead the most shallow life i could ever imagine. it sickens me.

you know, God has got to be laughing at us humans. we display the highest level of stupidity among all the creatures of the earth, yet we think we're so advanced. lets think about this. man invents the gun. we then proceed to go about mass killing each other with this new invention. man finds a plant that gives cancer of the mouth to anyone who chews it. so what do we do? we add some even more vile things to the mix, make sure the mix causes addictions, roll it all up in a piece of paper, light it on fire, then stick it in our mouths so as to best breathe in smoke and toxins. this is your standard cigarette. this is your standard cigarette that you pay money for. i wouldnt put something thats on fire in my mouth unless to show off, and even then for a short period of time with a more spectacular flame and a less deadly fuel for the flame, and id be careful not to breathe it in. i mean really, youre breathing in some of the shit that cars spit out because its worthless. the cars spit it out and into the atmosphere and we all bitch about it burning a hole in the ozone and causing global warming that will melt the polar ice caps and eventually kill us all. and youre going to actually pay money to stick a piece of paper with cancer forming plant in it in your mouth and breathe this shit in. we have detetors built into our houses to catch any deadly gases floating around, but youre going to pay to breathe some in. who here knows what aspestice is? you know, that shit that we use to use in homes and buildings and thermal protection suits because it was an excellent insulator? it was found to be cancer forming and outlawed. the cases of cancer from aspestice we relatively few in number. cigarettes are proven to be cancer forming by many many cases and you pay to smoke them. find me logic in here. then we have marijuana. the plant is found to fuck with your brain and basically kill off brain cells besides having most the effects of cigarettes. whos stupid idea was pot? i think theres a special place for you in hell. God has got to be looking down on this one fully stumped as to how he could create his prized race and they would turn out this fucked up. what are some of the names for when people have smoked pot? baked? stoned? i mean, can we be any more straight up? baked? think about that. it fries your brain so much we say youre baked when you smoke pot. i dont even know where to go with this one. if that doesnt make sense to you theres no hope. have you ever thought for a second that maybe theres a reason the government outlawed it? everyone looks at the government as this big bully pushing us around, but seriously guys, what purpose would a government have in mistreating its people. odds are they're going to want to keep you alive as long as possible. population is the power of a country. you think pot is outlawed so they can look at us and go 'ha ha, you cant have it'? i think its outlawed because of the effect it has on people and their bodies. i think ive beat this one to death... dont bother reaming me out about any of this, i warned you not to read it if you didnt want to. as for now, im out of here.

me and Tash and Rachel hung out last night. so many adventures in one night. it left my shirt smelling with a smell from basically everything that happened. taco sauce and perfume and soap and whatnot. we picked up Cheif eventually too and it was some night. but i took Rachel and Tash back to Rachels eventually. and we and Tash just sat in the car kissing and it was just.... this is what its about friends. the arguements and bad feelings and all.... they didnt matter because in this moment i was happy... and in this moment i learned... i learned what is all for. i may get mad at Tash sometimes. Tash may get mad at me sometimes... but that means nothing and theres a reason why it doesnt.... and in that moment, i learned the reason.

-Incubus, When It Comes


so ive been listening to a whole lot of the Make Yourself (Incubus) album lately. that album kicks ass. i never really thought about why they named it that, though that is one of the songs on the cd. but it really is about making yourself, the better portion of the album. and thats me. i make myself. i am me... and no one can change that... none of you. and i have to be that way. its the only way i can be. ive learned i cant really depend on much out of anyone at all. its myself i depend on... it keeps from getting hurt, because ive only myself to blame for anything and everything. and ive only myself to look to for everything. i really am a loner. its my only defense on most days to think of myself as needing no one else but me. and thus i depend on other things to replace the part of my life where people should be. i depend on my bike, and my guitar, and my car, and my music, and video games... and all the things that are my life... and all the things that really mean nothing... all the things that are empty and meaningless and vain. but thats all i can do. thats all i have. because we are all vain. every inhabitant of this earth, we are all vain. and eventually you too will come to the realization that yes, everything really is just as it seems. theres nothing below the surface, all that you hope in to be right and good and deep... theres nothing... its empty. what you see is what you get. it seems the motives really do match the means. all ive hoped for... the depth to this earth... the reasoning behind everyone that must somehow explain how you all act.... theres nothing. yes, life really is just as fucked up as it seems. we live in a two dimensional reality where nothing really runs deeper than the picture you see in front of you, and everyones motives are just as fucked up as their actions would imply. and youre fucked up, and im fucked up and we're all fucked up together in this fucked up pointless life we live. and its all in vain. you cross the street, you tie your shoe, you go to school, you kiss your 'other'... its all in vain. and we're all vain... and we're fucked up... and we're all going to hell because God by all rights should want nothing more to do with us, and i look with amazment upon his patience for not having torched this whole forsaken planet in the fires for the End.
please, i beg of you all.... someone reaffirm my belief in humanity... please... i need to see that not everyone is so fucked up... i need someone to show me..... show me life beyond the surface. show me that deep down, you really do have a good heart... show me you can care for another person. God couldnt have really left us all to die like this with none to carry on good. 

'so dont let the world bring you down
not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
remember why you came and while youre alive
experience the warmth before you grow old
where did it go?'

now that thats out of the way... today is mine and Tash's 1 month, so we're going to have a big shout out to Tash here

HAPPY 1 MONTH TASH!!

and as corny as that was and as much as the boys will make fun of me for that, i really dont care at this point. in fact all that really matters is how much fun it was getting as bitch ass dirty as i did today on my bike in that huge field of mud. i mean it was a swampland... and you know what else, im not taking a shower tonight. i dont feel like it one bit, so im not going to. no big deal, im pretty sure over the whole spring break i took a total of 4 showers. 2 of which were the last 2 days, the other 2 were the 1st day and the 3rd day, leaving about a week in the middle there. yeah.... im really in a sarcastic mood right now... its probably best you dont listen to a word i say, because everything that comes out will be a very sarcastic pessmistic outlook on life which will cause you to realize just how fucked up our lives really are. thank you and goodnight

16) learn some scales on guitar - nope

17) grow some rad ass white trash side burns

19) get some new cds: Counting Crows - August and Everything After, Counting Crows - This Desert Life, Boston - Rock and Roll Band (a collection album)

meh, so the list goes, on to other matters

so ive thought i was done with a particular group of people and a particular topic but it seems something... er... someone needs addressing. so Kate, it was apparently sweet of you to defend Kasey against me, or so says Kasey, so i think im going to have a word with you about saying anything to my girlfriend. actually more than a word... you know what for the record, dont ever threaten my girlfriend again, alright? youre not going to 'hurt her' alright? kick my ass, dont lay a finger on Tash. there will be no more physical threats to Tash, and im not asking you, this is how it shall be. 'shall' as in the legal word used when refering to the fact that there is no other possibility. alright, i have a real good idea for you, seeings how we dont like each other, ok? you dont concern yourself with anything in my life, and i wont concern myself with anything in yours. sphere of influence, ill stay out of yours, you stay out of mine, and as of now that includes Tash and Adam Bernal among others. i will defend these people to the death if needed. i dont believe i need to take this any further, as much as there is that i feel needs to be said, i will restrain myself because its not another arguement im looking for, but so help me God if it comes down to it i will not hold back again. this is the second time. three strikes and you will run to the gates of hell for safety.

"event","i woke up this morning to my brother telling me we had to go pick up sticks so my dad could mow the lawn. ah, the age old tradition of picking up sticks... who does that? well i laid in bed for a while. it smelled and felt so much like summer. my shade was closed but there was a little light coming in and it was the light of summer approaching us. i liked it and i hated it all at the same time. i think part of what i hate about summer is what it was as opposed to what it is now. at one point summer was hanging out with my 4-year-older-than-me friend, Ryan, (which is a big gap when youre 6 and hes 10) and playing games to the occasional zap of the bug light in his backyard. the smell of brats. skinned knees and treehouses and english muffins and that one time we slept in a tent in Ryans backyard and Tommy puked all over himself. ah... those days are all but gone. not even the most vivid of memories have been saved from turning to a grey photograph in my head. after that was Erik and Rav... and Phil... and Dave... and Steven... and Scott... and Paul, and Chris, and that kid that i dont remember his name... and numerous others. the biggest games of baseball (football, soccer, tag...) ever. this was summer. kool aid and bikes and baseball and.... and its all but gone. and then after things started to pick up. and it was the riding days. and Rav and Erik were still there. and then there was Matt, and Ben and Sam... and Jesse and Kyle and occasionally Jeff or Kevin or a few others, like that kid who looks like Snoop Dogg. and we rode and we terrorized the land. and it was good. and that group broke up and left me fucked for good summers for the first time in my life. and the next summer was worse as they drifted further away. and heres this summer and its lookin to be as the last two were. its going to be lame and im going to sit on my ass all damn day. and so it shall be. and if anyone knows how to bring back the glory of summer, please do. but until then winter will always be my favorite, and in that season i will live, and the other 9 months of the year will be anticipation of the 3 that are sure to come back to save me. and in this time ill watch that which is left of me die and shrivel in the summers sun.... somebody save me, i beg of you.

(no, i will not buy you cigarettes... yes, i will buy you porn.) so yesterday was pretty fun. i got up late (which in my terms is early) at noon. hung around for a while, then Erik came over. then after a while Tash called from her uncles cell phone from New York cuz... it was my birthday. she told me i HAD to go to a strip club or she'd be mad at me. you see, there are no strip clubs that 18 year olds can go in within 2 hours of here. so i asked her if going to the porn store was good enough and she said yes. so of course, me and Chrissay went to the porn store. Chris was afraid everyone would think we were gay going to the porn store together. thats alright Chris, we already think youre gay. its not quite what i expected. it was actually really funny and for the first 20 minutes i couldnt stop laughing. especially at the Fatty Patty obese blow up sex doll... seriously, even if i wanted that, i would feel like an idiot buying it. and the people working there were two relatively young girls. how do you go home and tell your mom you work at a porn store? aaaaaaaanyway. so break is more than half over and im not doing so good on the list, so i figured i better give it a check over.

"event","<P>so its definitely the beginning of spring break, and im definitely sick like mad. 'i kinda feel like i got hit by a truck' is the comment ive been using to describe it. not that i really know how it would feel to get hit by a truck, but if it counts i ran into a car stopped at a stop sign on my bike pretty hard when i was like 5. i&nbsp;feel really badly light headed.&nbsp;all my joints ache. my knees. my ankles. my hip. my elbows. my wrists. my shoulders. my neck. my entire back. even my fingers and my toes ache a little. im pretty sure im going to hire a japanese lady to give me a massage, cuz japanese are good at massages and having a guy do it would be just weird. then again, japanese are good at everything. she'd give me a massage then beat me in a decathalon and in 7 different video games. on second thought, maybe ill hire a russian lady, cuz russian girls are just hot. besides that russians are cool as hell. hmm... maybe i wont hire anyone because im pretty sure that i dont have enough money and im definitely sure Tash wouldnt like that. Tash, ill hire you to give me a massage any day. i may have to pay by other means though......... such as cheesecake. holy damn... has anyone seen the commercials for the new cheesecake blizzard (are they called blizzards?)&nbsp;things from DQ? oh man.... i assure you those would be just orgasmic. Tash, when you get back im taking you for cheesecake blizzards, cuz i know you like cheesecake as much as me... or so i think. so im definitely really cold right now. this is strange because im never cold. its epecially strange cuz the rest of my family is usually always cold and theyre not. yep, im definitely sick. so i made myself some hot chocolate. is it weird to chug a steaming hot beverage, cuz im pretty sure thats what i did, and it didnt hurt a bit. i had hot chocolate when me and the guys when to george webbs last night too. so the lady there told us that theres a $2 minimum per person and Cheif wasnt getting anything so he had to buy 2 bottles of water. me, Chris, and the Jew all spent about $5, doesnt that more than make up for cheif not buying any. thats still an average of almost $4 per person. what, was he supposed to wait outside while we ate? its george webbs, not the seven seas (which, by the way, we're going to tomorrow). i think it wouldve been fine if he stayed in there with us. then these morons come in and sit down around the corner of the bar from us and theyre staring at us and making fun of us the whole time. i want to see people like that dead. we didnt even do anything stupid. i can see if we all went in there wearing womens activist shirts or something, but im pretty sure we acted decently normal (which is something new for us). i guess i wasnt in the greatest mood cuz i was sick and felt like crap. i had one of those headaches where it hurts in the back of your eye, too. and me and the Jew noted that that eye was partly closed and real dark underneath. some ibprofen got rid of that pretty well today, but the being cold and the aches press on with the onslaught. me and Tash hung out last night too, as i noted in the previous entry. it was amazing rad. we hung out in her grandmas backyard for a while and i was in a weird lovey-dovey kinda mood. yep, pretty sure ill be harrased for that comment by the guys, but ah well. we were talking about how my body aches and she said i must be old, 107, going on 108 to be exact. and we were running around like little kids in the backyard and i told her i was gonna break a hip cuz im an old man and she was going to have to spoon feed me and give me a sponge bath in the hospital. i didnt know a broken hip was that severe of an injury that i couldnt feed or bathe myself, but im not complaining. then we watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacure and she kept jumping everytime one of those shocking moments would happen so i put my arms around her cuz she was laying with her head on my stomach kinda. that movie has a rather... interesting... plot. but it was a cool movie, none the less. afterward is when i went to Cheifs. at one point i fell asleep while Cheif and Chris played video games and Dan (the Jew).... 'watched.' and cheif used my stomach as a backrest (count of 2 people in one night) while i was laying there and he was playing video games and i told him to stay there cuz i was so cold and he was keeping me warm... im straight... i swear. i even had 2 sweatshirts on and a t-shirt&nbsp;and i was still cold. oh such is life. then this morning i woke up and took Dan home and went to Tash's to give her my sweatshirt i told her id let her borrow for&nbsp;her trip and we talked for like 10 minutes and it was cool. then i went home and crashed on the couch next to my cat. my cat is the coolest man. he ranks right up there with Bill, winter, and Tash... and Cheif of course, because me and Cheif have been going 15 months strong, mind you.&nbsp; anyway, that brings me to today... not a whole lot happened today so we're just going to go ahead and skip it, cool? i thought so.&nbsp;now to the main point of this post. im gonna make a list of things to do over spring break... more of goals to accomplish... and ill probably add a few after i finish this, and ill keep you up to date on what i did get done.</P>

"event","so i tried to make a big long post kinda explaining myself and my actions as of late to maybe better clear this whole mess up, but then after i had gotten an extremely lot written (staying up until 3 am) the computer froze and i lost it all, but now that i think about it, it wasnt really the best way of going about it anyway, the way i did in that. ive kinda collected my thoughts a little better here and im going to try to do this in the least offensive way possible. ive realized that in the midst of trying to get all my friends to stop arguing, ive thrown myself into a few arguements myself, and in essence, ive become exactly that which i hate. in order to fix the problem, i became part of the problem without realizing it, so maybe we'll try to work things out here, cuz to be totally honest, this is really stupid and overall pointless and if i lost a single one of you over this id be a hyporcrit, and more over id hate myself for it. i think between hanging out with Tash last night and hanging out with the guys, i have a more positive outlook on all thats been going on, and life in general, so im going to try to do this without ranting or making anyone mad again.

means and motive. i think we're going to have to look at these two words in order for this to make any sense. means is the way by which you intend to reach your goal or the way by which you intend to accomplish a desired outcome. motive is your reasoning for trying to reach that goal or outcome. lets say you want something to eat, so you go to a resturaunt. means would be the road you take to get to the resturuant, and motive would be that you want something to eat. are we all agreed on this much? i hope so, if you havent followed me on this much theres really no point in reading further, but i will continue anyway for the sake of those who do understand, which i would hope would be all of you. now that we've established what means and motive are, why dont i relate it to the topic at hand? see, i want you to seperate the two here. calling someone an asshole would question the motives, would it not? in otherwords, the many who think im an asshole right now are questioning my motives, when, in fact, it was my means that you didnt like. i think ill illistrate this point with a little fictional tale and hopefully you'll agree with me on this point afterward. so theres this real little kid. well this kid always watches his mom go out to her garden with some hedge clippers and cut all the weeds and other unwelcome items in her garden. well his moms birthday comes along and he wants to do something special for her but hes real little and he doesnt have money and he doesnt know what to do. finally he decides hes going to go out and trim the stuff in her garden for her so she doesnt have to work on her birthday. well he gets out the hedge clippers and he goes out to the garden and he starts clipping away and he decides that a garden is supposed to be green to look nice so all these colorful flower heads have to go. so he clips the heads off all the flowers and leaves nothing but stems and weeds behind, because the weeds are, in fact, green. he gets done and looks at the all green garden and thinks to himself 'moms gonna love this, wait till she sees it.' and he gets all excited to show her. on the surface, was this a nice thing to do? if i went and cut the heads off some lady's flowers, especially if she spent that much work on them, i think shed be pretty upset. is the kid an asshole? i dont think so. i dont think hes even a bad kid in any way. i think this is a question of means against motive. his motive was to do something special for his moms birthday. his means was cutting the heads off all her flowers. thus, i contend that its motive, rather than means, that determines if someones an asshole. now this story i dont like to think as entirely perfect of an illistration, because ive put much thought into this, and the means i use i find to be the best way about it, but you get the general idea. but anyway, back to means and motive. if i dont sit with Tash at lunch, i assure you its not because i hate her, or i think my friends are way too much cooler than her. i think Tash is amazing, to be honest, and i hope she knows this, and i think she does. my motive is finding a way to spend time with both my friends and my girlfriend in one day. my means is to hang out with Tash for 40-50 minutes before school, and hang out with my friends for 34-36 at lunch. dont call me an asshole for this. tell me im going about this the wrong way, tell me i need to find a better method. dont write off everything im working toward by calling me an asshole.

the next question of means and motive is my supposed 'half-assing' of this relationship. once again, i think half-assing is more of motive than it is means. you have to get in the same playing field here, dont call to attention my means, by insulting my motives. i think we'll have to have another story for this one. in a certain neighborhood, theres a new fad going around. all the little kids are having their dads build them a treehouse. and they just keep getting bigger and better. everyone has to one up their neighbor. so this little boy doesnt have a treehouse at all, and the kids are picking on him and making fun of him for it. well finally his dad feels bad that he hasnt built one for his son yet, so he decides hes going to build one thats going to blow all the rest out of the water. this guy is going to take this unofficial treehouse conetest to the extremes and hes going to put electricity and running water in this thing, and its going to be 3 floors total and have a balcony and a big bay window looking out onto the neighbors back yard. well the guy gets started and realizes what a huge project this is and finishes the first floor, then takes a break to eat. then he finishes the second floor and he takes another break to take a nap. he gets done with the third floor and its late now and he decides he better get to bed. the next morning he skips breakfast and comes out to put the balcony on. he gets done with that and goes back in cuz now hes really hungry. he eats real quick cuz hes so excited about this treehouse, he feels almost like a kid again and he knows his son is going to love it. so he goes out and gets the electricity hooked up and he worked up an appetiete while up there and he comes down for dinner. he goes back up and puts the bay window in, and you wouldnt believe how tired he got carrying that bay window up, so he decides its time for bed again once its in. the next morning he remembers how hungry he got for having skipped breakfast the day before and he sees another full day ahead of him so he makes sure to eat this time, but you better believe over that whole meal hes thinking about the treehouse and hes getting real excited because its really coming together well. so he goes back out and he finally gets water pipes in, and it took a lot of thinking to figure out how to do that, so he needs to relax so he goes and watches tv on his favorite chair for about an hour. he starts to get anxious because hes real close to finishing so he goes out there again and he seals all the walls in case it rains, and he paints the outside all at once. he comes back in for a late lunch and only finishes half of it because hes too excited about getting done with the treehouse. he paints the inside and works on all the little details he needs to put in and make sure its safe so he entirely misses dinner, because he wants to have it done for his son to see before his bedtime. he ends up letting his son stay up an hour later, because he's finished it and he wants his son to see. was he half-assing it because of all the breaks he took? i mean, im sure he wouldve finished sooner if he really cared about it that much and didnt take any breaks. is that the first thing you thought of when you finished reading that, that hes half-assing it by not working straight through to the end? i really hope not. i think he's anything but half-assing it. once again, means or motives? his motive is to make the best treehouse in the neighborhood for his son so no one can make fun of him anymore. his means is taking as much time as needed to build this treehouse right. does he take the breaks because he doesnt care about the treehouse and he just sees it as tedious so he has to get away from it? just because im not with Tash every waking moment of my life, it doesnt mean im half-assing the relationship. contrary to what women believe, guys love building things and fixing things. we dont see it as work to put a treehouse up. and i dont see it as work to hang out with Tash. i love hanging out with her. but the guy needs to take time out to eat and sleep, just like sometimes i need to take time out to hang out with my friends. am i half-assing it? personally, i dont think so. i can see if i were just flippantly saying 'i dont care' and so i went off and hung out with my friends, that would be half-assing it. this all wouldnt bother me so much if i didnt care. if i was half-assing it, it wouldnt matter that so many people are getting on me for this, cuz i wouldnt care.

now, i suppose this is still left up to 'well, i guess you'll just have to believe me' when it comes to what my motives are, but just take this to heart. if you told the little kid who cut his moms garden for her he was an asshole, i think he'd be a little hurt, and odds are, being a little kid and all, he'd probably start crying. if you told the guy he was half-assing the treehouse i think hed be hurt to say the least, considering all the effort he put into it. just try to look at things from my point of view once before you prejudge my actions. to be honest, im trying my hardest here, so it hurts a little when people just throw that out the window and call me an asshole. im not going to plead total innocence. i can see that if you didnt know the whole story, or if you never really took the time to understand what i was thinking, you may think im an asshole about this. i cant say that if i was in your position i would have done anything differently, so i dont blame you at all. i think the better portion of all this is one massive misunderstanding that we all need to get past. as far as the whole my friends all hating each other apsect of it, im not sure what to do yet, but i think for now ill just leave it alone because it seems to me i may end up losing friends trying to fix that and that would make me a hypocrit. i hope the damage thats already been done isnt irrepairable. i really would like to stay on good terms with all of you, and i hope you feel the same way, but i guess theres nothing i can do if you dont. so lets try to work this out, shall we?

"event","is the word 'antiprogress' officially defined as being a word? because if its not it should be. what better would describe the recent weeks than antiprogress? its like trying to empty the water out of a sinking battleship with a bucket and a sponge, if its going to sink, its going to sink, and theres nothing you can do except slow it down a little bit if you work real fast. just that youre standing on the boat to empty it adds weight to help it sink even faster than you could make up for with a bucket... antiprogress. get out the life preservers, cuz we're all about to drown. abandon ship, cuz you better believe im out of here like i never even cared about it. if it truely is two steps forward, and four steps back, shouldnt we be changing direction sometime soon?

finally im just gonna say what i mean and if any of you dont fucking like it, no one told you you had to read it, most often i leave shit out to protect the innocent, but you all can fucking kiss my ass cuz it just makes me look like an asshole most of the time the way it sounds after my editing and then people get pissed and honest to God im sick of you all for the most part and if you think im an asshole after this, no skin off my sack. i really dont give a shit any more. i spare, though, the few who really are innocent, which i feel include Bryn, Adam, Chrissay, and Steve (Squeedge), among a few others

this is how it is. to start, when i get to school in the morning, im going to sit wherever the fuck i fucking feel like sitting. when lunch time comes, im gonna fucking sit with whom i fucking feel like sitting where i fucking feel like sitting. after school i will hang out wherever with whomever i fucking feel like. alright? if you dont understand this concept i will tell you right now i dont want to hear about it... dont talk to me. im 18 in less than 2 weeks and by fucking law i dont even have to listen to my parents anymore then, if you fucking think im gonna fucking listen to you try to tell me what to do you better rethink your strategy. second off, which i know im gonna get harrassed for, i refuse to take maturity advice from a bunch of sophomors. in fact, i refuse to listen to the better portion of certian people i know bitch about how they think im being immature regaurdless of what age they are. youre all real fucking mature. youre so fucking mature you can make arguements like the grown ups do and you can not talk to each other like the grown ups do.... aww... whered you learn that from, your mommy? or did daddy teach you how to be cold and cruel? whats next, is the teacher going to show you how to play nice with the other kids and share your dollies? man... youre so much more mature than me... God, i wish i were you. i wish i had the ability to be cold and cruel and never forgive anyone no matter how sorry they were because i would up and fucking never talk to any of you again. fucking understand that, ok? if i were like the better portion of you who cant fucking forgive anyone and get fucking pissed off whenever someone does the slightest fucking thing to agrivate you, i would never fucking talk to a single one of you again. have any of you ever thought for one second that just maybe its not my favorite thing in the world to hear you whine about how much you dont like people who happen to be my best friends? lets get something straight here, Todd and Ryan ive known for longer than ive know the better portion of you and just happen to be some of my best friends... I DONT FUCKING WANT TO HEAR HOW MUCH OF ASSHOLES YOU THINK THEY ARE. there, its in big print for those of you who have trouble grasping this concept. next person that tries to tell me what assholes they are im going to walk away that instant, ok? you know what the best fucking part is ladies and gentlemen? i told them that i didnt like hearing about who of my friends they dont like and they fucking stopped. yes, thats right, i fucking defended the better portion of you and thanks a fucking lot for the grand way of paying me back. and what else? if theyre such assholes than why are they the only ones who seem to realize how much i fucking hate hearing about who you all dont like? if the rest of you are such great people why do you persist in informing me how much you hate all my friends. alright, ill give that Cheif has stopped bitching too, but beyond that the rest of you have not been spared. oh, and i guess i play myself up to be the victim. yeah, thanks, i put up with your shit for too fucking long with you showing no remorse and when i finally fucking snap and tell you how it is, you fucking think im trying to be the victim. eat my shit. how do you want me to react? 'God, your friends are such assholes' 'oh yeah, thanks, i thought so too, thats obviously why i hang out with them.' hey, maybe we can all get together and throw a huge party where everyone takes their turn telling me how my friends are assholes and i shouldnt hang out with them and then afterward i can go scrape my teeth with a piece of rusty metal and then drown myself in your toilet. you know, if i made a list of all my friends who have come up as someone that another of my friends doesnt like, i assure you every single one of you who are bitching would all be on the list too. when you bitch, keep in mind, someone else i know is bitching about you, and i defend you to them the same way i defend them to you. you hate someone, i assure you someone else hates you, ok? is it so hard of a concept to grasp now that i dont like hearing about everyone you hate? i suppose so. i suppose tomorrow morning the better potion of you are gonna have your heads too far up your asses to even care about what i have to say that youre going to bitch at me for something i put in here. you know what, save yourself the time, i can tell you right now i dont want to hear it. i stopped listening to most of you after you kept bitching to me about my friends and trying to tell me who i should hang out with and who i shouldnt. if i was trying to make myself out to be the victim i would be looking for your sympathy... i dont give a shit about your vain sympathies, i want you all to fucking stop bitching. thats all i want. i detest hearing you bitch about my friends. it puts a bitter taste in my mouth so bad i want to spit. i want to spit it out and light my tongue on fire to get rid of it. next off, those of you who decide to give me relationship advice by telling Tash how much of an asshole you feel im being to her might as well go right ahead and shoot me in the face because i want my brain so fucked up that i never remember that i knew any of you again. honestly, get a gun and shoot me, you'll feel better, and ill feel better. if you know so well how to date Tash, why dont you kill me, and date her youself? im pretty sure Tash can think for herself and doesnt need you to be implanting all your bullshit into her thoughts. and i dont need your instruction either because i couldnt really give less of a shit about it unless you learned how to properly communicate with other people in a fashon that doesnt present a sour attitude. if you learn how to be nice and talk ill be more than willing to listen, honest to God. have any of you noticed when Tash hangs out with me she doesnt think im an asshole, but when she hangs out with the certain few of you, she does think im an asshole? do we notice a patter here? when she thinks for herself... we're ok... when you try to tell her how to think... we hit the rocks. wait, whats this... yeah, you all are such definite good friends of mine, that you're working toward Tash and i breaking up, because thats what you're doing, whether you realize it or not. and to that certain someone who was telling me im the reason for my past relationships being so short, all that while did you ever think once that maybe that hurt me... alot? i mean at what point does common sense kick in and tell you that maybe saying 'you're like the little boy on the playground who cant get along with all the girls' might potentially hurt someones feelings? and what did i fucking do about it, again? all the while you bitched at me and made me feel like an insignificant piece of shit i swallowed it down and forgave your insults as they poured out of your mouth. and so as to not have anyone else thinking youre a bad person i never told them about most of that arguement, ie, Tash. i never told her the better portion of that arguement for her sake and for your sake and then she got pissed at me when you went and told her those few select things you felt were important to make her think im an asshole again. define irony, cuz this is it right here. but thanks much for not telling her how i explained to you my reasoning for why i didnt say hi to her at lunch at which point you said 'it sounds like you two just have a communication issue' which would have maybe cleared things up a little bit, but instead she was pissed at me again after school today. i fucking already am kissing ass to be in her good favor every other day and you decided to add to the flame, why? you especially i am dissapointed in. ive defended you against the better portion of people who are my best friends and who have been there for me so much unlike yourself at this moment. the people i hold dearest, that i would give my life for, i defended the likes of you against them and never said a word to you about it so as to keep you out of the trouble and thanks a fucking lot for being grateful. you may never know how much you hurt me with all the insults you hurled at me, and look back to that and try to find one fucking thing i said to you that could even relatively be taken as an insult. i really did think you were something special. please do me a favor and dont concern yourself with my buisness ever again.

how do i want you all to take this? honestly id rather you not take it as me telling you all how angry i am with you, even though thats what it is. id rather you look at it as a wake up call to knock the shit off, but somehow i dont see that happening anytime soon with how arrogant most of you have turned out to be. despite all i may have said i forgive each and every one of you, excluding no one. im sure right now that means nothing to most of you, and you think im being an arrogant bastard by assuming you want my forgiveness, but i do. i cannot stay mad at someone, its not in my nature. even that particular persion i had an especially long rant about at the end... honest to God i would love for things to be cool with you again, whether you believe it or not right now, and ill be pretty bummed out about it if shit did get fucked up between us. but i felt like all i said about everyone really had to be said. i drove home torn between being in a fit of rage and feeling utter hopelessness in my future with the most of you. to clear the record, im sorry... i really am, for anything i may have done to any of you previous to this, or anything i may have said in here. but come tomorrow morning i dont want apologies. i dont want arguements. i dont want sympathy. i dont want bitching. i dont want anything even relatively negative. all i want is to forget any and all of this ever happened, and i want to never have to listen to people telling me that im an asshole, or that my friends are assholes. please.

"event","god do i wish it was winter. i mean i have this longing beyond that goes beyond human comprehension for winter to be here again. and the worst part is, winter just ended so i have to wait until next winter. i dont want summer, honest to God, i dont want this summer. give me my winter back. now. i wanna move to northern alaska where they have snow all year round, and winter is 3 months of night. that would rock so much ass. i think i would orgasm on the spot it would rock so hard. and then id just die. id fall over and my eyes would roll to the back of my head and id die, because i could not handle the glory that would be winter in northern alaska. and you all want to move to florida and california to get away from wisconsin winters. wisconsin winters kick so much ass. thats the best part of this place. i want winter back. i do... i swear on my life i do. i want to sit in front of the fire place, with a roaring fire in it, and look out the window to 2 feet of snow and a slightly grey overcast sky. and i want to drink hot chocolate and cuddle up to stay warm. and i want to have 5, yes 5, blankets on my bed. i want to wear 2 hoodies and 2 other shirts under and 3 pairs of gloves and 2 pairs of socks and my thicker softer boxers. i want the cold. i want the long nights and short days. i want the snow. i want the fires. i want the hot chocolate. i want the clear starry nights. i can truely say there is nothing on earth i want more than this right now. its all that could make me happy right now(though im open for suggestions). i NEED it. i NEED winter. right now... i want it to come back. i cant wait a whole spring, summer, and fall. and its just making me depressed that there is no winter, and there wont be, and if snow came everyone would bitch like theres no tomorrow so i couldnt enjoy it anyway. as for now im listening to some Tegan and Sara i havent listened to in a considerable time and its just simply amazing, and its really all i have right now to abate this feeling... this utter longing for winter.

"event","take nothing for granted friends. as cliche as that is, its true. and we say it and we think it and we dont even really consider it in the end. dont be vain about things, no ones here to say you have enough time on earth to be wasting it on some of the things you all waste it on. i spose i wont harp on the everyone arguing anymore. youve heard my stance already and most of you just got pissed about it. i give up on it, you all are a lost cause and if someone else wants to pick up being mediator, the best of luck to you, you truely have a noble heart. as for the rest of you... argue all you want. dont talk to your closest friends. you can harbor this hate for as long as you please for all i care, but i will make myself clear on this, i do not want to hear a single word of it. not a word... dont even imply it... i dont care. if you dont like my friends go ask your grandma for a doggy treat because i absolutely detest hearing about it. dont ever say i didnt try. im not mad, as this post may seem to imply. im actually quite calm about it. theres nothing more to do. i guess im a little dissapointed in some of you, but im sure you hear that enough from your parents 'im not mad, im just dissappointed.' either way... youve heard my views so when you eventually come to your senses and realize i was right you know what ill say...

"event","im fucking tired as hell and i feel like shit. i felt like shit all last night so i barely got any sleep. and i was shivering all night even though i had the covers on.

as of right now i watch my all my friends start battle with each other. this is real great. i love you all. you all are so fucking great... i obviously need this... i need to watch you all argue and bitch and complain... this is what i need... i need it to keep myself in such great mental condition... i want to watch my life disintigrate before my eyes. why dont you fucking listen. get a fucking clue. youre too fucking full of yourselves to notice how much your fucking arguing has been killing me. ill fucking leave and ill fucking never talk to a single one of you again and im not fucking kidding. the more you spit out your mouth about who you dont like the less i want to hear your voice again. what the hell could be this important to you that you cant fucking forgive and forget? i want to take a wrench and a screwdriver and some tape and i want to fix you. youre broken and i want to find out why and i want to fix you. i want to see you in working order. i cant fucking take this anymore. im knee-deep in all your bullshit. i have to wade through the shit that you drop on the floor and leave there. go ahead, roll in your fucking filth, wallow in it. lick it up and spit it out. let it run down your body... feel it against your skin... bathe in it... and when you fucking wreak of it im not gonna give you a fucking hand. im gonna turn away from your stench and act as if i never knew you. or maybe rather ill smash your face in and let you bleed this out. ill open your flesh to let the anger and hate out. and your sustaining life will run out through the wound, your vitality will puddle on the floor in front of me and ill never know what could have been, but ill never have to suffer your arrogant, self-righteous voice again. never. never will i hear you bitch again. never will i hear you complain again. never will i hear you speak as though you somehow are by Gods will created better than the rest of us again. youre mortal. you bleed, i bleed, all those you rank on bleed. the sooner you fucking understand this the better. knock it the fuck off and get the fuck along. youve been warned.

"event","alright, i can see my last post turning into a battle ground, so just to clear up the record, Tash, im not mad at you (except for the smoking thing, which will be resolved on a later date), im more so mad at myself for all of this. its the whole hard on myself thing... i feel like 'well this is great, now she wont wanna hang out with me anymore if i say stupid shit like that every time.' and to be honest im not putting that on you, i understand this thing is different for guys and girls and all and i probably would be mad if the roles were reversed with me being the girl and all. just for the record i do think you are a classy girl and i hope everyone else reading this knows it."

"event","<P>this is how i feel, if you dont like it, dont read it</P>
<P>so Tash was mad at me all day today because of something i said... or typed, rather, and i didnt mean quite how it came out and i didnt really think about it. welcome to the wonderful world of being a guy. i really did feel bad about it all last night and today.&nbsp;yes, i made a comment that was mean. and i suppose the better portion of you have all heard about it already. looks like your beloved matt is not all youve played him up to be. im just an asshole like the rest of the world. i suppose you all are the stupid ones for having expected a single bit more out of me. im an asshole like the rest, im sorry i led you to believe otherwise. Tash was cool about it after school though... but she still let me suffer for a while in my guilt, but i guess everythings cool...</P>
<P>i spent my last dollar and 2 quarters for lunch today... it was that or go hungry. 8th hour i gave the rest of any silver coins i had to Jen for gas money and im left with nothing but copper... or pennies, for those of us who don't talk in names of metals. i have to put some gas in the car because to cover my tracks as to how far i went friday night i reset the odometer, which would be fine if i could put like 2 gallons of gas in to match it, but if i dont itll read that it was 200 miles on this tank of gas when the average is at least 270 to a tank. for those of you who have not fucking clue what im talking about, im pretty well fucked if i dont put some gas in sometime soon. besides this im not gonna have money for lunch until i get a job or at least until my tax returns get here. besides that 2 of my 3 guitars have a broken string, and the one with all full strings is the shitty mini guitar that i got for $12. i hope to fucking hell that job at ace comes through, but im not banking on it... honestly i doubt it will... it couldnt, my life wouldnt be complete unless i didnt have a job. it would throw the balance of the universe off if i had more than one good week in a row... or even relatively close to another good week.</P>
<P>next in line... my report card came. i have 1 f, which is better than i had figured, but im still up shit crick when my dad gets home. why dont we all go ahead and base the better portion of our entire FUCKING YOUNG LIFE on some FUCKING NUMBERS and FUCKING LETTERS that are figured to somehow represent the way in which we've wasted 7 FUCKING HOURS A DAY, 7 FUCKING DAYS A WEEK, 9 FUCKING MONTHS OF THE FUCKING YEAR. and then the irony of it all is that my homelife becomes such shit in the days following my report card that i actually wish i was gone and the only place i can be is at school, so the very thing that did me in is my only refuge from all the fucking shit its caused. besides this all spring break is coming up and thats real fucking great... i can sit on my ass all fucking break debating the purpose and general direction&nbsp;of my life while watching fucking MTV spring break specials and all the fucking free people out having fucking fun in some fucking sunny paradise running about their shallow pointless lives because somehow they've found the meaning of happiness and how it really does lie in shallow things like sex, beaches, and alcoholic beverages. and then will come my birthday and ill get some gifts that are somewhat thoughtful from some people, and rather not from others, and both types will go to futher a shallow, materialistic existance, when all i really want is my freedom and some respect and support from my family. i wish that report card never came. i want to take it and tear it up and light the pieces on fire and leave them to burn on the floor at school where they can help to light the entire fucking&nbsp;school on fire and i will sit and watch it burn with a bowl of popcorn, a cold drink, and a sick devious grin on my face, and i will lose everything of myself to the glory and the insanity of the moment and you will never know me again.</P>
<P>'too bad the things that make you mad are my favorite things'</P>

"event","so its sunday. i havent updated since wednesday. i get side tracked sometimes. so anyway. to be entirely honest, i dont really remember anything important about thursday. i walked into 6th hour like 10 minutes late cuz i was off taking care of other things. yes friends, this makes it 4 days in a row i missed a big portion of 6th hour. eh... ah well. i hung out with Tasha after school again. after i dropped Tasha off i went and dropped by Kaseys house and we hung out for a while, cuz i havent hung out with Kasey in some time and i figured why the hell not. i took her to Burger King, cuz she told me shes never had Burger King before. actually to be honest i didnt think of it until after we showed up there... i just wanted a burger. then i went home and my mom had made spaghetti. i love spaghetti, especially my moms, but she used some different sauce for this stuff and it wasnt that great.

friday came. not much happened during the day. to be entirely honest i cant really think of anything that happened at all. id inform you as to if it made a week that i missed part of 6th hour, but i dont remember 6th hour. meh.... so after school though. i took Tash home, and she told me to call her later. see, she had the house to herself for the weekend. so anyway. i got home and at 5 cheif called me. i asked him if we were doing anything and he didnt really say much. i called Tasha and i went over to her house. we went out for food and somehow ended up at george webbs on highway 100... past cold spring.... that was a hell of a drive. we ate and cheif called and i asked him if he wanted to do anything again and he told me to call him after we were done. so we finished and started heading over toward his house and i called him when we were like 2 minutes from his house. the three of us went to starbucks so Tash could get some coffee, then cheif went to little caesars to get some buffalo wings, cuz it was like a matter of feet from starbucks to little caesars, and me and Tash went to get the car and Tash turned around and threw her arms around me and looked up for a kiss, and so i kissed her and we ended up spilling coffee and some weird dude was just staring at us. so we got in the car right away and went drove it back to little caesars. cheif was still waiting so we went in and this dude with funky hair kept making some really funny comments like 'i hope you like them HOT!' and we had a good laugh. then we went back to cheifs and played video games on the original nintendo. first we played some fishing game (cheif named himself 'sweat b') where when you get a bite, this guy comes up and says 'hey sweat b, i feel a bite on your rod.' and then while youre reeling it in it just looks like the dude is jerking. as if this wasnt enough we went and played some olympics game where the runner from germany looked just like bill clinton. it was a fun time. for most of the time i was laying there and Tash came over and laid so her head was resting on my chest and i kinda liked that... it was cute. eventually i went to take Tash home, but instead we went to the lakefront at 11:30 at night and just parked there. at this point i realized there was a gap between the two front seats making it hard to get close and without thinking of how bad it sounded i said 'we could get in the backseat.' at which point we laughed, and she got out of the car, then got in the backseat and just sat down and looked at me with this cute innocent kinda 'it wasnt a bad idea' look. so i got in back and it must have looked a hell of a lot worse to the outside world than it really was. to clear the record though, we didnt do anything beyond kiss. it was romantic, not sexual. eventually 1 am came along and i said i better get home and shes like '10 more minutes' and i said 'well i guess i can drive fast.' that was kinda cute... she didnt wanna go home and i know i didnt either. and so 20 minutes later we left to take her home. we got lost on the way back to her house too. i got her home at about 1:50, and drove home, half falling asleep the whole way. i got home and got bitched at by my parents and went to bed. it was a good night overall. saturday i hung out with Erik most of the day. he came over after work. we went to get dinner for me and my brother, but my brother is afraid to stay home alone even though hes 13 so we had to take him too. so me and Erik hung out for the rest of the night cuz my parents bitched at me and wouldnt let me go anywhere. so we walked to the park and ranted about school and other such things and it started raining and we got soaked. then later on after everyone was in bed and whatnot i called Tasha and we talked until 4 am, at which point i went to bed.

as for now its raining and thats pretty awesome man. im hungry and im off to eat something

"event","so i spose ill delve a little into the rest of the goings on in my life right now. so monday i found out im failing physics with a 60% and i have 4 missing assignements that i could possibly pass if i get them all in and get 100% on them. right. like i could get 100% on any physics assignment in the time period of one day. so than i go to second hour. this girl was selling cheesecakes and a while back i asked my mom if she wanted one, cuz she loves cheesecake (i do too, but i have no money for such a thing). well so my mom says she does and she'll give me the money. well monday was the day the girl needed it by and i was signed up for a cheesecake already so i had no choice but to give her my $4 of lunch money and pay the other $4 in quarters. thus, i had no lunch. (yes, i do carry around $4 worth of quarters sometimes). monday was also the first day of 4th quarter. i have 2 new classes, and lost 2 of my study halls for the classes to take their place. reaaaal great. the day just drags on now. at lunch i got yelled at by mr luedke for having the wallet chain. lick my ass, luedke. i made that chain out of a bike chain i once rode (and twice broke) its my creative piece of work. its kinda like a trophy like 'i rode so hard i broke through metal.' i remember when i got called into his office for it and he told me i couldnt have the gothic look. he called me gothic. i have nothing against gothic people, but in that one sentence he just distroyed everything i stand for and everything gothic people stand for. this is our loving Lutheran attitude friends... well 6th period comes and i get a slip saying i have to go up to mr walz office. mr walz is one of the assistant principals, and the one who hands out the detentions to people. so i get in his office and he starts telling me i have too many attendence related detentions, so i have a saturday detetion to serve. real great. so i have a saturday detention now. at this point he decides its the best time to inform me that i have to shave and he gives me another detention for that. (yes, its school rules at my school to shave). so thats just real great. i had been telling Ryan that nothing else could go wrong before this. so i got back to 6th period, walked in and said 'i was wrong Ryan, NOW nothing else can go wrong.' and i was right. nothing else did. werent expecting that, were you? nor was i man. i hung out with Tasha after school and went to get coffee with her and took her home. it was rad. then i got home and i got a call from ace hardware, i had put an application in and they want to have an interview for a job. yessssssssssss. that would be a hella cool job. i get to work with tools. all i can think of as better is working at cascio, but meh... take what i can get. this was monday.

tuesday. tuesday i talked to Tasha at school a little more than monday, that was pretty rad. im beginning to realize how much this is going to suck to have 1 study hall instead of 3 now. dammit. ah well... one of the new classes is with Mr Becker. Mr Becker is probably my favorite teacher. the class is also an archeology class, so that will be fun. 6th hour, once again, i get a slip to go up to mr walz office. im up there at least once a week as of late, but one day after the other? well i get there and he says 'hi' i say 'hi' he says 'back again' i say 'yeah' and i put the slip on his desk. he looks around a little and says 'why are you here?' and i say 'i dont know, i got the slip to come up here' he looks through his stuff for a bit then says 'i dont know why youre here' im like 'alright' he calls the attendence people and gets off the phone with them and says 'sorry, our mistake' and sends me back to class. alllright. well then after school yesterday... well you can read about that in the last entry. then last night cheif tells me that he saw my final physics grade..... a 69%. 70% is passing. 69% is failing. if i just bullshitted half of one of those four assignments i probably would have passed.... thats just grand. meh.

so today went slow as ass. i was anxious about that whole interview and i wanted to hang out with Tasha, and i hadnt really talked to Kasey in a while, and i didnt really get to talk to cheif... i just didnt want to sit in a goddamn desk and do nothing... none of which i wanted to do. whatever man... thats school for ya. me and my sister traded cars today for the hell of it though, so that was kinda fun for a change. cept we had a fire drill today (6th hour) and i park right near the door and all these people went out by my... er... my sisters car... and it made me nervous with the guitar just sitting out in the open and all in it. and i said something about that and Ryan is saying how nothing will happen to it. a couple seconds later the masses set of some other persons car alarm. it kinda made me nervous to have all them right by the car. eh.. whatever man. holy shit, i just realized this is the third day in a row that for some reason i had to leave during part of 6th period. after school i served my detention and realize my cd player was out of batteries so i just slept through the detention. then afterward i took Tasha home again and came home to get ready for my interview (read: to change my pants... my mom insisted i dont wear jeans with holes in them). so then i go to the interview and im not really sure how it went. he said he has a few more interviews to go through and he'll get back to me. well... hope for the best. as for the moment. i have just witnessed my sister trying to do yoga to just the sound cuz the picture went out, that was a tad funny. funny thing, the person on the yoga tape is named Natasha... rad. im tired and sick and my back hurts and im off to bed.

'can you see her waiting there for someone like me?'

"event","so friends, this is how NOT to be smooth. after having read this you are gonna think 'wow, matt is really uncool.' like the mellow yellow commercials, i would have picked the wrong choice as to whats smooth. but hey, it was a fun time, so poke fun all you want, but we'll see who had the more fun.... or something. so here, i spill my guts out for you..... or... at least what goes through the head of matt at just such an occasion.

so i hung out with Tasha after school today. and we just kinda drove around and went to Whitnal park and whatnot, and i had Counting Crows playing the whole time, mind you. then i took her home. so i told her im walking her to her door whether she liked it or not, just cuz it seems rude to me to not walk a girl to her door... or something. thats irrelevant. so we get up to the door and we're just kinda talking and its cool.... no.... its cold. so we're standing there shivering just talking and it soon became apparent to both of us why i was still there... i was hungry... wait... no... thats not it. so we're just kinda standing there and im like 'i better get home' and so i give her a hug. and then we just kinda step back and she kinda looks at me then rolls her head to the side. and im like 'what was that look?' as if i didnt know... and shes like 'Jessie' (you see, Jessie had been telling her and me to make out with each other). and so im like 'alright, nows not the time to be bringing Jessie into this.' so than we just talked some more. and eventually shes like 'so, are you going to kiss me now?' and im thinkin, 'oh man... that just made it even harder... deep breaths...' so after some stalling im about ready for it and i realized how akward of an angle it would be cuz im too tall for my own good. so i needed to do some thinking on my feet, literally, and i came up with the plan that i was going to lift her up for it. yes, matt, that was a real great idea. so i lean over to get into hug position, then i lift her up. we get one little kiss in and shes says 'this is too weird' so i put her down, and we try again, and i was too tall as i had thought so i had to lean over and got a horrible angle at it, but it happened anyway. so for those of you out there watching at home... this is the thought process involved in such an occasion. anyway, i went home more or less in a daze. and tonight she put 'mr jones' by Counting Crows in her journal, so i thought that was hella rad.

so the answer to the question from now on: yes, Tasha, i am going to kiss you now"

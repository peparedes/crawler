If anything they should b tears of joy, but ik they're not. Like at my Uncles funeral, just standing there looking at him, thinking y him? but then i relized he was ment to get the sickness and to die, so there i said, ""Oneday, someday, Ill c u again, but not anytime soon uncle, bcuz its not my time."" thats wat we should look at it as, not something said but b glad about how one has made the journay to the end"

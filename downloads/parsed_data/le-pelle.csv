"event","I'm really anxious right now. I'm like, excited for no obvious reason. Probably because, somehow, someway, I got to thinking that I will someday meet Zach Braff. Or, for the most part, someone extremely similar to Andrew Largeman...But I mean, he's out there. I have this theory, that there's a person for everyone, it's just a matter of whether or not you find that person. 

So. I guess I'll find my Andrew Largeman. Hopefully before it's too late, because I really don't wanna turn into Co Minh. 

I hate school.

"event","Ok so Aly told me to update. I guess I was being hypocritical on getting mad that she didn't update even though, I never update this thing. Heh. 

The Christmas season is here. Who would have thought? Just yesterday I could have sworn it was the beginning of summer. I can't wait until Christmas though. It's so exciting, the days that lead up to Christmas, but then the night of Christmas, you're just like, blah because the magic's over. I mean, what's the next holiday that is actually exciting? New Year's? Heh. No. My birthday? Heh. Not this year, since I'm turning the big one three. Christmas is the only holiday that is exciting and cool. And it's about love and spending quality time with the people you love (and about that house on Montecito that always kills all the other houses because it's so damn bright). *Cheesy Smile*"

"event","I feel like no matter what is going on, it gets harder and harder to catch up and keep up to date here on Livejournal. I wish I had more time but I just don't. I miss you all so much and it makes me so sad to say I think my days of updating regularly on here are long gone. I'm not deleting my journal and I will still be reading as often as I can, and trying to comment and I will probably update here and there but in the mean time, I wanted to let you all know how to reach me on other social media sites that I am much more active on.

Please add me on any and all of these if you haven't already. I love you all so much. Please don't remove me (unless my lack of updates will bother you for whatever reason) because I do really love reading about all of your lives. &hearts;"

A secret, a story, an opinion, anything. You can be brutally honest.
Not that I'm not interested in what you have to say, but I'm also really curious as to how many people read or come across this journal."

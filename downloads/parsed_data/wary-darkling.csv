<b>BEIJING (AFP) - A Chinese company has had its license suspended after it tried to make money by selling land on the moon. 

The Beijing Lunar Village Aeronautics Science and Technology Co. managed to sell large swathes of pristine lunar property before being shut down, the state -owned Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.

The company, claiming to act on behalf of an entity referred to as the Lunar Embassy in China, charged 298 yuan (37 US dollars) for each acre (0.4 hectare) on the moon, according to the report.

Each lucky new owner of lunar soil was issued a ""certificate"" that ensured property ownership including rights to use the land and minerals up to three kilometers (1.9 miles) underground, Xinhua said.

Li Jie, CEO of Lunar Embassy, said that 34 clients bought 49 acres (20 hectares) of land on the moon in the first three days after his company became operational last month.</b>"

"event","Life hasn't stopped.  I'm having a hard time distinguishing if I am falling into an old, a very old trap.  When I was very young I threw myself into ""life"".  Marriage, children, work, their lives, the home where ever we made it, my husband's military career.  It all landed me in heavy therapy facing demons and issues that were long ignored.  That I ran from.

I feel I'm there again.  Running at 100 mph from anything that might get me.  If I get up early, keep running and don't look back, I'm safe.  I'm overwhelmed right now with all that I have heaped on my plate of life.  It's a good tactic and others agree.  What could be wrong with diversion?  What's wrong with creating a life so full, so busy that you don't have time, any time at all, to feel pain, to see the demons that keep trying to surface?  Just keep running, stay too busy for anything and nothing can get you.  Right?

There's glitch in the plan though.  I'm so exhausted.  I'm not as young as I was then and it's starting to yell back at me.  ...

I'm so tired and desperately need rest.  I've mismanaged relationships.  Friends, parents, and loved ones.  Anyone who always counted on me to be there, I haven't been, though not for lack of trying.  I've been too busy running, keeping my agenda over-filled with no gaps and now I am paying the price of being forgotten, being the target of anger from those who came to expect from me.  This leaves me with resentment for I begin to feel taken for granted.  As if I'm not allowed to live my life as I wish to.  Why am I responsible for other adults in my life?  Why is it my responsibility to take care of other adults?  It's been so long since I've felt a gentle touch.  Someone to brush my hair, rub my back.  Make me feel cared for.  Worthy.

Too busy to feel, too busy to care, too busy to deal with emotions.  I am tired today.  Tired and terrified that if I cannot get going, something will surface and swallow me into that void.

Why can't I ever find the balance?  The healthy balance?

*bleh*  I'm off..."

"event","What kind of people take care of, love, gain the trust and love of precious souls and then abandons them?  How do you gain the unconditional love and trust given so non-discriminatory by animals and then just leave them?  *crying here*...

<center><img src=""http://members.cox.net/warydarkling/misc/VA33550408961.jpg"" alt=""Frankie and Freddie""></center>

They are pure bred Blue Point Siamese.  They are 11 year old brothers.  They are declawed.  They were some body's everything until a month ago.  The people entrusted with these beautiful, precious little souls moved away and it wasn't convenient to take them with them.  They dumped them at the SPCA to clear their conscious of any wrong doing and left them.  They are at my friend's house because they got stressed and sick at the SPCA and she was asked to please come and get them out of there.  The staff was afraid they would die from disease, stress and despair.

They are grieving.  They are confused.  They are sick.  They don't understand what has happened to them or even why.  They are so precious *crying my eyes out*...  How???  How do people do this?

Please!  If you can't, for WHAT EVER reason you think is justifiable, cannot take your pet with you, at least do the right thing and make sure they are in a home, adjusted and doing alright before you abandon them.  The SPCA is NOT going to find them the perfect home.  It is not a magical place that finds forever happy homes for your pet.  This belief that your pet will find a home and be happy for ever more is a f*cking myth!

I wish I could contact the people who had them.  I'd tell them how sick they are and that they have had to get iv antibiotics and fluids.  That they just may not make it.  That they are confined to a room at a house where there are lots of animals including noisy dogs.  That they cry constantly and that they are so confused, so sad, and so upset.

*can't stop crying*...

I do a lot of work with animals and every now and again, some case comes along that won't leave my heart alone and quite frankly, tears me to shreds.

Frankie and Freddie are in the Hampton Roads area of Virgina.  They need a home that does not have other pets, no other cats, no dogs and no small children.  They would be perfect for a retired person or persons.  They need a lot of love and consoling.

Please don't leave your pet at the SPCA under the guise that they will be okay and that they will find a forever happy home.  Not that it doesn't happen, I have case loads of happy homes...  But it isn't the rule and to allow yourself to dump your pet there believing that...  damn them..."

The weather has been in the 80's and much easier to take.  I have been enjoying my time outdoors.  It's liberating and I can feel the summer heat depression lifting away.  Of course, it will really take of in the fall.

Kina continues to do well although I don't know how much longer she can be confined to this room.  She is starting to go snake shit at times out of boredom.  I have been bringing in the other cats for introductions.  While she is very curious and friendly in all mannerisms (body language and so on), my other house cats remain pricks about the whole thing.  Pretty soon we need to start letting her out of this room to acclimate to the household.  I just hope we don't loose her to a dark corner under the furniture!  Ferals are fantastic about finding these places to hold up in.  Sooner or later however, it needs to be done.

In the meantime, she becomes more and more of a baby every day.  We can now pet her thoroughly without loosing a digit.  She loves to play and engages most of the contact with us herself.  There are a few blurry pictures of her behind the following cut.  She doesn't stay still and she was difficult to photograph.  She has a congenital defect to her upper eyelids and cannot open her eyes all the way.  I am taking her to a veterinary ophthalmologist to further diagnose the condition.  She is completely adorable just the same.

I ordered a brand new digital camera that shoots mpeg video and a 128mb memory stick.  It was stolen en-route, investigations pending on both ends (shipper and postal) and well, all I got was the bill!  I so want this camera to take video of Kina.  She is so adorable.

I honestly have so much to do, a headache and no motivation to get crap done.  I need to take something for the head, drink some cold water and get the hell outside!

Pray for the people and please pray for the animals.  They are innocents, they really are..."

Life is changing and I do struggle to see the good in it.  I get none of this from humans, but find my happiness, peace and contentment with animals.  A pure language of the heart spoken.

Kina continues to do so well.  She lives in the house now with us and her socialization process just keeps improving.  She is so sweet, so very sweet and so good.  I thank God everyday for sparing her life so that she can share it with us.  She is, a true and beautiful gift.  Not to mention, she is the cutest thing you ever saw! *smiles*.

Life can be too mundane to note in any kind of journal.  So I'm off to live it instead of discussing it.  Sams Club on a Saturday, I know I've lost my mind.

The weather here got beautiful for a few days but we've been back in the heat for the past few days.  Today will be around 100 with heat indexes of 110-115.  I feel wretched with all this heat this summer.  There is nothing anyone can do, but I know my sanity suffers in the extreme heat.  I abhor it so, I really do.

I stepped out of myself yesterday and ordered myself a new digital camera.  One that does mpg video with audio.  I've kind of questioned myself all night about the purchase.  Part of me feels giddy and excited, part of me wonders what in the hell I am doing heaping another monthly payment to the plate.  Ouch!

We have got to move Kina into the house this weekend.  After much debate with the husband, he has finally ceded.  Originally we were going to put her in my son's room when he left for school.  Now that he's not leaving for at least another 6 months, that blew our plans out of the water.  So we now have to move her into our room which is a pain in the ass.  I hate having my bedroom door shut and the other cats are going to go nuts because they can't get in.  I only know she cannot stay in that enclosure any longer.  Her socialization has been wonderful but it needs to advance from here.  To keep her in the enclosure is now becoming cruel since she has become friendly, accustomed to human contact and needs more room to live.  I wonder what I'm doing sometimes...

I have, in the past, written to Dear Abby and run some pretty serious issues before her in all sincerity to hear the advice of her and others...  Not once, EVER, has anything I've ever asked this b*tch gotten any response.  Then I read the column and I see this bullsh*t?!  I want to choke the woman!!

<i>DEAR ABBY: I have recently become engaged to be married. My fiance and I have been together about seven months. We plan to be married next June.

My mother and I are trying to decide the proper time to put the engagement announcement in the paper. She thinks we should do it in a few months, when we have made our final decisions about the wedding. I am clueless. Can you help? -- IN LOVE IN TEXAS

DEAR IN LOVE: According to Emily Post, announcements can appear as long as a year in advance of the wedding, or as short a time as one week. However, two or three months before the wedding is average.

I could just throw up *blurgh*...  What is wrong with this place?  We have Arizona temperatures with puke humidity thrown in for good measure.  My husband has put in for a vacation day tomorrow because of the heat.  He works without air conditioning in a welder's get up.  This heat is going to kill people, mark my word!  We're lucky enough to have central air.  There are so many downtown in older places that do not have air conditioning.  I really feel for them, especially the really young and the elderly.  It's no joke for anyone, but it's especially dangerous for them.

We already have a plan to take Kina in the house when these temperatures hit.  Cats have no perspiration system and this kind of heat is severely dangerous to them.  Fans and shade don't cut it when it's this hot.  They just don't.  We'll get her inside under the air conditioning.  I pray that when these next two days are over, we will have seen the last of this kind of heat.  I live for the fall and will throw the biggest party when the northern winds cause me to have to put on a sweater!  I so seriously hate the summer, I always have and this month has been hell with the heat.

We are still recovering from the financial burden of Oscar's illness.  We could manage it if other things would leave us the heck alone.  Things like car registrations, misc. taxes and things that don't occur monthly are making it impossible for us to catch up on anything.  I'm sick of having no money and all we do is work.  *bleh*

Okay, I know I should try to find the silver lining in life, but for today, the haze has everything feeling so oppressive so I'll have to get back to that one.  I'm going to head out and wash my car before the heat really bears down and give my poor flowers some water since the thunder and lightening we've been getting has produced nothing in the form in rain.  Everything is dying in this heat.  *sighs*...  Ohhhh glorious fall and winter, I will embrace you!!

I could cry *bleh*.  The weather here has been wretched and there is no end in sight this week or next.  I'm truly worried about Kina.  If it were up to me, she would be in the house right this moment.  My son leaves for Arizona August 15th.  My plans are to make his room up for her so she can come into the house, complete her socialization and get accustomed to being part of the human and feline family.  These long hot days make me wish I could just bring her in now.  Might not be optimal, but I can't stand that she is enduring this heat outside when we can simply walk into the house and escape the heat.  We're doing everything we can to get her through it, but I still feel awful.  We have three, good blowing fans positioned around the enclosure.  The enclosure is already in our garage so it's far removed from any direct sunlight.  It goes without saying that the back door is propped wide open and the front garage door stays all the way open until 10 at night.  By around 8:30pm, the temperature drops enough into the high 70's and it does bring her relief from the day's heat.  It's a long time to wait though *pouts*.  Of course she has plenty of cold, fresh water and we are constantly going out to add ice to it to keep it cool.

A few more weeks and she will be indoors and I can stop my fretting.  She will even have her own room.  I am going to get a window perch to put at the window, some kitty furniture and I've got to obtain a day bed for that room.  It will eventually be my sewing room/guest room so I will go ahead and put a day bed in there to start with.  That way I can stay with Kina and she won't be alone.  My computer will be in there as well as right now it occupies space in my bedroom.  I'll be glad to have it out of our room.

*wry grin*...  From the way I write, it sounds like I'm anxious for my son to leave.  Not really.  Patrick and I always shared an extremely close, unspoken bond.  It played out when he was very small as being extremely close by, huggy and the only requirements for him at bed time were his ""booky"" (blanket), and me.  I remember how I used to love to stroke his soft baby hair and smell that soft baby smell...  Now as a young adult we share a closeness that means comfortable conversations, warm smiles and an ability to know what the other is thinking without words.  I will miss his presence in my life on a daily basis and it is with a very heavy heart that I will see him off.  *smiles nostalgically - sighs*...  Okay, nothing worse than a sentimental mother!

I'm off for what the day has to throw at me.  With God and Jesus at my side, I can't fail *cheeky smile*!"

"event","A Glorious Sunday morning?  I wish I could say so, but it's shaping up to be equally as hot and humid as it was yesterday.  The rest of the week doesn't offer much hope of anything different either.  *bleh*.  I'm trying to keep the spirits up but this heat is depressing to someone like myself.  I miss my hiking boots and jeans.  I miss my long sleeve henleys and sweaters.  I am not a summer person and can't recall ever being one in my entire life.  I see so many people enjoying this weather and I feel suffocated by it.  I am surprised how the heat and humidity can literally bring me to tears of frustration and weariness.  Yeah, I have actually *wry grin*...  I hate the bugs, I hate the sound of the katydids in the trees, I hate the sound of the frogs at night.  I feel like I'm living in a swamp.  At least up north we could count on the evenings and nights to bring in relief from what ever the day may have thrown at us in the summer.  Her in the Southeast there is no relief.  The temperature drops a little but it's so humid at night you could slice the air with a knife.  I live for the cooler weather and all the wonderful feelings it will bring with it.  Show me the fall!

My son leaves in another month for Arizona.  I think I'm mentally avoiding it so my heart doesn't shatter.  I sat across from him at lunch one day and let the fact sink in.  I instantly welled up with tears and couldn't swallow.  I know all about how he's a big boy now and he has to use his wings, etc...  But my heart is having a harder time adjusting than my brain is.

I will be moving Kina into the house when he does leave.  Her socialization has gone extremely well and she has come so far in the 2.5 months we've had her.  She's gone from a completely feral adult cat to greeting us close up, allowing for head scratching and playing with us.  Still more socialization to come, but she's made remarkable progress in a short period of time.  She's so adorable, you just want to snuggle her up and cuddle her.  The frustration is that you know you can't.  She still swats when you feed her though.  It's a strange thing.  You can climb into the enclosure.   Play with her, scratch her head, she kneads and purrs, twist all over the place playfully and lovingly.  Then when you go to place her food bowl in the enclosure, she smacks the hell out of your hand *grins*...  It's weird.  When my son vacates his room, I will furnish it to accommodate her and make her transition into the house with us and the other cats.  Another lengthly process, but not impossible.  I am desperate not to have her as an outdoor cat.  The dangers outside are too many and she is much too sweet to be out there.

"event","Too much to update my own personal journal on *sighs*...

Where have I been?  That's a really good question.  I know I've been asleep through the past few months and I know I've been living a nightmare inside.  I feel like I'm waking up and rubbing my eyes to a world that doesn't feel so estranged anymore.  I like the feeling.

I've heard the words through various music that I listen to and they seem to reach something inside that the words never did before.  Like some sort of connection, contact, and some kind of light goes off inside that makes me feel strangely peaceful and good inside.  I feel like I've never been alive before and now I'm just emerging.  What does it take to keep this feeling going?  I wish I knew.

I've learned that life does go on and with me in it.  I've learned that I'm not such a horrible being and if it means nothing to anyone else at all, to God I have meaning and value here on this earth.  He has proven it to me and that is all the explanation or proof that I feel I need to offer.  If at times I feel that no one else cares or loves me, he's proven to me that he does and will be there for me.  I'm not sure why I couldn't or hadn't found that earlier in my life but now it doesn't seem important to me to even ponder the question.  I know he's here now.  No one had to lead me to him, no one wore me down to install any beliefs.  I did not walk into a church.  I found him on my own in the midst of what life had to throw at me recently.  Whether you agree with me or not, approve or not, I like waking up every day knowing that someone walks with me, who knows everything I am and still loves me, is still there for me, and guides me every step of the way.  It's a very personal thing and it's your prerogative to believe as you see fit for yourself.  As for me, I like waking up to my days now...

Nothing has greatly changed except for how i feel inside.  We are still in debt up to our ears, past our ears actually...  The summer is bearing down on us with the most depressive, humid heat *bleh*...  Kelly and I still struggle through this thing called marriage, but I think we'll be okay.  I nearly lost Oscar, my feline angel, but again, God proved to me that he can, and does, bless us poor lost souls.

Do I run the streets preaching?  No.  I do not have the knowledge or the right.  Do I damn others into the ground?  No, I do not have that power or the right to judge.

I'm weary of being angry and feeling cold.  The world is going to do what it is going to do.  Being cold to it and feeling so much anger got me nowhere.  I will live my life as I see fit for myself and if God has chosen me to feel blessed with his love, his companionship, then how can I not feel so good inside?  It is a severely private thing for me and I'm internally basking in the warmth, the peace, and the good that I am deriving from it all."

I am hanging onto the days, going through the motions, trying to be sociable but not succeeding too well.  Flitting little conversations that don't hold any real meaning and the longing to find that (what Alanis coined in the phrase) intellectual intercourse?  Bleh.

Kina is making steady and ongoing progress despite the heat she endured this week.  I need to spend more time inside her enclosure with her to push this socialization further.  I must admit I'm a little on the nervous side of going back into the enclosure after being attacked by her earlier this week.  But I can't sway, nor will I.  Kina will be socialized when all of this said and done.  She is so gorgeous.  Such a beautiful little soul...  I love her and will never give up on her.  We've come this far, right?

I'm done with my coffee *looks in the cup and pouts*...  I need to start making copies of all the paper bullshit I need to get postmarked today.  I hate the government and I HATE local taxes!

"event","I feel like a moth under the porch light.  Keep beating my head against a wall.  Bleh, sick of myself even.  I told Michelle things last night over some drinks that I probably shouldn't have talked about.  Why do we do that shit?  She started mentioning things, so I dutifully opened up as well.  Always makes me sick when I actually divulge childhood shit to someone.  Why did I do it?  I feel ugly enough and doing so makes me feel so much more ashamed and even uglier.

I've been so internalized these past few months.  I feel like a murderer plotting the perfect murder, but instead, I am just trying to get from one day to the next.  I feel ugly and cold.  My disdain for people continues without any reprise.  The people here are so mean and so ugly.  I'm sick of them and I can literally see myself snapping and killing someone.  Pretty scary shit from where I sit.

This front coming from the south has swamped us with unreal hot weather.  Today's high will be 97 and the heat index is expected to be 110 degrees, Fahrenheit that is...  I am not a summer person.  Despite the fact that I love to work in the yard and garden, always sporting a summer tan and I love to go out on the boat, I do, in fact, really despise the summer.  I feel more alive and so much better when the weather starts to cool down and I can feel that icy wind through my senses.  I'm always at a loss at these people who just lurrrrrv the summer.  They can keep it.  My straight hair suffers, always stuck to my head and face and I despise that sticky feeling of always feeling tacky and sweaty.  Give me my jeans, my boots, and an oversized sweater ANY DAY!

Kina (a.k.a. Precious) is making such progress.  It's the slowest thing I've ever undertaken.  I have worked with feral cats before but never on a 24/7 one on one basis.  Each step is such a baby step and it has taken weeks for me to see the progress, but it is there.  Husband doesn't know it yet but I have no intentions of releasing her to the streets as an outdoor cat.  She <u><i>will</i></u> be one of our indoor cats ultimately.  She is much too sweet natured to be an outdoor cat.  I don't want her outside where mean people can get to her and God knows what else.  Besides, she has a congenital defect to her eyes and while she managed for two years as a feral with those eyes, I see no reason why she must continue.  She will be an indoor cat if I have my way.  She relaxes with me now, comes up to me and in the last few days is laying down with me.  She still hisses her little ass off when I bring her food, but the rest of her body language says ""Oh yes!""  Poor little thing is so confused.  Her feral instincts are conflicting with her desire to change.  It's okay though, because in the realm of the entire world right now, she is the only living thing that I feel comfortable with and can sincerely relate to right now.  We are, each other's comfort zones and I'll take her over anyone right now quite readily and vice versa.  Perfect.

I'm trying so hard to get alone with husband.  I've eaten crow and I'm bending over backwards for him but I feel like every time I turn around I get whacked with a bag of shit.  He's been so moody and snappy lately.  Out of the blue and without provocation, I get put down, critisized and hurt.  I feel so confused.  I don't know if I should sit, stand, be quiet, or talk.  Nothing seems to make any difference.  I can't do anything right by him and I feel that old familiar apathy approaching that is putting me in the mindset of not giving a shit again.  I'll just keep to myself, not talk to him and be his little robot.  Sooner or later, he won't be able to stand it and the tables will turn.  I'll get to watch him beat himself against the wall for a while.

Off to another sweltering day.  I HATE SUMMER!

"event","The days are really busy trying to do the things I do and still find enough qualifying time to spend with Kina (a.k.a. Precious).  I'm still really upset about money and the fact that just when we have a handle on our budget, someone or something comes along and fucks with us.  Soooooo overtired of this kind of shit.  I've grown really cold and cynical with the world, and well, I don't know really how to change that.  I look all around me and I really hate the people.  Mean, selfish, uncaring place.  Outside of the handful of people who make up my world of family and exactly 2 people I call friends, I've grown to hate people with a genuine disdain.  Bleh, enough.

Kina is a beautiful little soul.  Socialization is going so much slower than I could have ever imagined.  Some days it's two steps forward and three steps back.  But I love her so much and I giving up is not an option from any angle.  She is trying really hard too.  She comes out more and more now, guardedly, but she does.  She is so cute and only if one could see her, would they understand what I mean.  When I come to the enclosure, she comes at me.  Ears semi flat and she is hissing her ass off.  She'll even do the little spit thing one or two times.  I put my hand to the wire and she sniffs it.  Then she backs off and stares up at me with the most pathetic look on her face that seems to be saying to me ""I'm so confused but I'm trying really hard!""  Awww tiny Kina.  I love her so and time is the only thing that will change anything.  She was feral for nearly two years and they say that the older they are, the harder they are to socialize.  I have no expectations of how I think she should be.  I won't begin to compare her to my kitten raised, in home cats.  I know she will always be different.  I respect her for it and I will accept any boundaries she maintains.  The best that I am working towards is a compromise of necessary interactions between us to make having her live here with us acceptable and reasonable.

I saved her life and I guess right now, she is saving mine.  She gives me any feelings of warmth I may know right now and she gives me reason for tomorrow.  You and me Kina.  You and me..."

I am so tired of feeling so full of hate, so hopeless.  The only thing I strive for is the night time so I can put another day behind me.  I wake up dreading the sun, the day.

After twenty years, one would think I'd have learned not to turn my tired heart and head to the husband.  What is it in me that repeatedly turns to him for comfort only to be slammed with insults and criticism?  I have only myself to blame.  I love a man, have always had a love for a man, who has never been able to share the level of care that I have always longed to share.  I sought it in another but ultimately, through choice, chose my husband.  Days like today make me regret.  Days when I'm so tired and beaten down, heart tired, my head feels like lead and I long for an ounce of comfort but get none at all.  Not so much as a hug.  Just cruel words and criticism.  I have only myself to blame.  My choice, my bed...

*crying*

I miss you Al.  I miss the friend I had in you.  I miss the gentleness of your voice, your warmth that embraced me, bathed me and comforted me.  You could make all the world disappear.  You gave me peace, rest.  You brought me around to myself and returned me to myself.  You were my strength, my courage, my warmth, my love.  For reasons my heart can't put together, you took it all away from me without consulting me.  Just left me.  Abruptly and painfully, just walked out of my life taking everything I was with you.  You never even looked back to see if was crying.  You never looked back to see if I cared.  You just left...

I feel so cold, lost, alone, scared and weary...  I made the wrong choices, again.

This weekend was too busy and went too fast.  While I love having my ""adopted"" kids home from college, I do yearn for a little more privacy and no one sacked out on my couches until noon or later.  I did too much land work yesterday and I'm paying for it dearly today.  Of all the things to injure, why did it have to be my fucking back?  Sucks...  Got a great tan though *wry grin*.

Kina (Precious) moves along slowly.  It's like taking a 16th of an inch each day.  I had to get into her enclosure to do something in there last night and I scared her worse than I have as of yet.  Scared her (/slash) pissed her off basically.  She was hissing, okay, no big deal but then she did that charge thing at my face.  Not cute in the least.  I fixed the things I needed to fix and she was fine after that.  She's all but forgotten it this morning, but I haven't.  I just have to plug on with her like nothing ever happened.  They don't remember, neither should I.  It's harder to work with her on the weekend because I'm trying to keep her hidden (a.k.a. feeling safe) with all these ""other"" people around.  She knows me more and trust me more but everyone in the family can't resist 'visiting' her and trying to pet her.  Two sided coin, she needs the socialization and the more people petting her, the more she will get used to being touched.  On the other hand, too many hands and she will stay frightened and withdrawn.  I don't know why I keep on it, it's all irrelevant.  I won't quit on her, it's not an option.  I feel like I'm working with a little Helen Keller of sorts *grin*.  Sooner or later I <b>WILL</b> reach that part of her that understands.  Crack the code?  Re-wire the thought processes in her little head?  Sooner or later, it will come to her that all I (we) represent is love, care, good feelings, food and such.  It's just going to take a long time.  A really long time...

She's a kindred little soul and I love her completely.

Need to get the car out to Va. Beach for its oil change, inspection, tire rotation...  Wish I didn't have to go so far, but free is worth it.  Need to call and schedule that, running out of time on the inspection.  Need to make copies of our federal filings *curls lip*.  We filed everything we needed to file, we paid the taxes we needed to pay and what do we get for it all?  Brownie points?  Fuck no!  We get a letter from the state saying that they need copies of our federal filings because our state refund is in ""error resolution"" out in Richmond.  I am <B>SO FUCKING SICK</B> of being fucked with.  All we keep trying to do is the right things and all we get is fucked.  I am, so weary of the world.  I told Kina this morning that I wish I could crawl into her enclosure with her, curl up with her in there and never come out.

*sighs*

In a lot of ways I have crawled into an enclosure.  I've alienated everyone who ever cared for me.  I've got little to nothing to verbalize to anyone...  I'm tired, not physically, but mentally, emotionally, so fucking exhausted."

Kina (a.k.a. Precious) is coming along.  I've failed to update my journal and let it be known that a week ago I successfully trapped her.  She tested negative for everything, was given her shots and spayed.  I spend hours each day crawling into her enclosure and reading out loud to her.  Today I started ""Touch Therapy"", with a leather glove of course.  She's handling it surprisingly well.  She wants to live under the kennel pad we put in her bedding area so I have had to start removing it every day to force her into the world of the living.  Otherwise, she will remain hiding and continue to be feral.  I give it back to her at night so she has some level of security.  She is the most adorable thing.  Even when she flattens her ears and hisses at me, she's completely adorable *grin*...  How strange is that?

Well, I just got through ripping/burning an oooooollllld school cd for a friend and I need to bake that cake.  I wish I could find my heart in all of this.  I feel like I'm walking through the motions for lack of knowing how else to be.  Otherwise I could fold up and give up.  I resent being told I'm doing okay.  I want to scream and punch.

"event","I should be relishing in the blessing of a new day and the opportunity to be a part of it.  I try, I'm really trying but I can't feel anything.  When does that come?

It had been nine days that I didn't go down to the yard to feed the cats.  Just as Animal Control had requested.  I couldn't keep going.  I had know that she was gone.  I had to know that it was over so I could put closure on the whole mess.  My heart was aching and I couldn't get around it in any way.  I walked up the back drive and stood clinging to the fence.  The yard was eerily still and there was no sign of anything moving.  I let myself cry.  The traffic roared from the busy roads all around but no one paid any attention to the out of the way yard behind this busy complex of stores.  I, like all the little souls who once inhabited the yard, were of no significance to a cold world beyond the fence.  Of all the cats, there were just two that I so desperately wanted to save from this scenario.  Two that I knew had the sweetest dispositions and were so much more friendly than the other ferals.  I knew these two had the best chance at socialization and permanent placement.  Placement with me!  But when the trappings began, I came to be at the mercy of the law.  When Animal Control told me that I was at the city limit with cats and that I couldn't have these two, my world turned on it's axis.  I had to find a way to grieve these two losses and just get on with things.

Someone spoke my name from behind me.  I was startled.  It was Olga from the store.  I said ""hi"".  She said ""She's still here!""  My heart swelled and shattered in my chest.  My worst nightmare had come true.  I frantically called for her.  ""PRECIOUS!  PRECIOUS!  COME HERE MY BABY, COME HERE!""  From between two derelict vehicles a tiny face poked her head above the tarp.  She came bounding out, tail straight up and crying her lungs out.  My heart, that I thought had already shattered inside my chest made sure I felt it let go again.  She was so thin, so weak.  I looked at Olga and told her ""This is what I have been terrified of!  I had visions of her sitting by the fence crying not understanding why I wasn't coming.  Hungry, confused and so scared.""

Olga told me that she was really mad at Animal Control.  That they hadn't been back since the past Thursday (six days prior).  That they removed the mother cats and forgot to collect all the kittens.  The smallest kittens had starved to death in the back seats of the cars.

""Precious"" paced back and forth on the other side of the fence.  Crying and crying.  I looked at Olga desperately.  She asked, ""do you have food with you?"".  My broken heart punched from inside of me.  I couldn't speak but nodded an affirmative.  She waved her hand and said ""Go on!  Feed her.  She's starving to death!""  I couldn't get to my car fast enough.  As I opened the can Precious stood against the other side of the fence, crying.  Crying and crying...

She ate so fast.  I was afraid she would be sick, but she wasn't.  She put her little paw on the paper plate and licked it clean.  I sat down on the pavement on the other side of the fence.  I cried for what felt like forever.  I didn't think I had it in me.  The joy of finding her spared from the trappings and the pain of knowing she woke up every day wondering where I was, why I wasn't coming and why she was being left alone and to starve.  The guilt killed me even though I understood it wasn't my fault.  ""Creamcycle"" was gone.  He had been caught.  I allowed myself to grieve what I knew was his demise.  Ferals are labeled as such and they don't stand a chance once Animal Control gets them.  He was so sweet, so playful.  He could have made it if someone had given him half the chance.  I cried and said out loud... ""I'm so sorry my angels!""

I went into the store to see Olga.  ""Please Olga, please.  I'm going to trap her.  Please don't tell Animal Control she's here, please?  Let me get her, please!!""  Olga said ""Of course!""

So I've been trying to trap ""Precious"" every day with Olga's help but to no avail.  She is trap shy and will not go into it.  I'm at a loss.  I don't know how to do this.  I'm trying all kinds of things.  Camouflaging the cage, lining it with cardboard...  She will not enter that trap no matter what I do.  I am desperate to get her out of where she is, get her medical attention and start her on her new life.  I'll accept any and all her boundaries just to have her with me.

I love you Precious and I will never give up.  Never..."

Every day gets better.  We miss Kaylab terribly.  I don't suppose that will go away for a long while.  The tears flow less each day and remembering him is starting to bring warm and peaceful thoughts instead of heart breaking pain.  I picked up his remains on Friday and the women at the vet's office were so kind to let me reminisce.  Kaylab is home and will be with us always.  He will live forever in our hearts, our thoughts of him, and our never ending love we will always have for him.

The day before we had to say good-bye to Kaylab, my son was involved in an accident.  Thank God everyone involved was okay.  The other woman was found at fault so poor Patrick didn't have any strikes against him.  He is only 18 and hasn't had his licence a year yet.  It was his first accident so he was pretty shook up about it.  The other woman was able to drive away from the accident but my son's car had to be towed.  It was totaled.  Her insurance company gave him the average fair market value for the car which turned out to be three times what we paid for the car in the first place!  On Saturday we bought him a 1994 Toyota Celica.  Female driven, dealer maintained and ohhhh so very sweet.  If you'll pardon the old saying here, my son is happy as a pig in shit :-)

This week is looking really busy and after last week, I wasn't sure if I was ready for it.  Now I'm welcoming it.  Life goes on and so shall I.  Kaylab is not gone from me, just transcended into a better place.  I will find my peace there and always keep him with me in my heart.

You make the mistake of thinking someone is deep, caring and stands out, only to discover they're a murky puddle of shallowness.

I've picked up the hardwood chest that will forever entomb my baby.  I was fortunate enough to find the perfect frame to mount on it as well.  This morning I will get the brass finishing screws, a secure latch, the stain and finish.  I need other family members input as to which picture we will use in the frame.  Once the picture is in the frame it will be permanant after it is secured to the chest.  The very last item to secure to the chest will be the brass plate bearing his name.  I will have that made at the mall.  One would think this is painful to do, but it is actually helping me to cope.  I don't think there will be a day in the coming weeks that doesn't have some amount of pain in it for missing Kaylab as I do.

I mentioned it before and I'll say it again.  The other members of the cat adoration community have been so supportive and so helpful.  So many truly wonderful people there.

It's still freezing here and it's extremely odd for this time of year here.  We have snow in the forcast and my stupid daffodils don't realize it's too cold *grin*.  I need to run out of here while there is a lull in the weather to feed my other cats downtown.  They won't come out to eat if it's raining, sleeting or snowing.

I won't lie, I'm tired and I feel surreal.  I waft in and out of tears but I think it's normal and certainly expected, at least by me, given the new situation I've been forced into.  A life without Kaylab after I'd grown so accustomed to one that included him.

Time.  A lot of time...

"event","At 9:17 am this morning, March 15, 2005, we said good-bye to our first baby.  He steadily declined with age over the last few years and his last few days saw him in a lot of pain.  We are dealing with the pain his absence in our lives has left, but I know in my heart we did the right thing for Kaylab.  One always prepares themselves in their mind for these things, but you can never prepare your heart for how much it hurts to loose them...

May you always have the warmest sun spots to lay in my sweet baby.  I will always love you so so very much...

Things are quiet here and yes, he is tripping over himself.  If he would just walk up, hug me and tell me that he's sorry it would be much more simpler than tripping all over himself to be 'good' or 'nice' to me.  What am I supposed to do?  I never get closure on anything because he can't simply admit that he was wrong and say he is sorry for anything.  F*cking head games, I hate them...

I have to get the house straightened up and ready for company.  The outlaws are decending on us from up north this week.  I honestly don't mind his mother, she really is wonderful.  His sister Michele and I have some battle scars between us but we manage.  His niece, Michele's daughter, however, is a different story.  She's 19 going on 20.  She's completely disrespectful, mouthy, complains constantly and you just want to either punch her in the face, choke her or both!  I don't understand why she has to accompany them anyways.

I couldn't sleep well past three this morning.  Around 5, the time he gets up for work, the cats starting being stupid.  One of them was on my dresser chewing the silk flowers, the old one came down the hallway howling like he does...  Kelly went to get out of the bed to address the old cat and I told him ""I'm getting up anyways.""  He said ""No, stay in bed.""  I said ""It's okay, I can't lay here anymore anyways, can't sleep.""  He said ""Stay in bed.""  I said ""Hon, I can't sleep.""  He said ""Lay there 'til after I leave!""

I was punched, again...  I said ""That was completely mean."" To which he said nothing but went about his morning routine.  I did, lay there until he left, crying my eyes out...  He left out of here mad at me, no good-bye, no kiss on the cheek, nothing...

I'm numb already and I can't get my head around what it is that I did to deserve this morning.  I didn't do shit and I get treated like shit.

Noting ever changes.  When I think we're doing good, he always manages to remind me how little I mean to him.  This morning was little, but it doesn't take a catastrophe for him to manage to make sure I feel like worthless shit...

"event","Today was pretty mundane.  I'm fickle I think because sometimes the mundane is comforting and other times I fight the urge to go insane because of it.  What does that make me?  Things that make you go 'hmmmmmmm'...

I was off today and while I had grandeur notions in my head about what I could accomplish today, today saw me being swayed with the day.  Just rolling with the way of things.  I overslept (8 am is very late for me!).  I worked on the laundry and went to take care of the cats behind the store.  I hate to get down there after 8 in the morning.  Other people see me there and I don't want other people to know that the cats are there.  People can be horribly cruel and I fear their safety if the wrong person finds out that they are back there.

After that I went to bring a wrist support to my baby girl at work.  I stayed, had a cappuccino, had a few conversations with good folks and watched her fiance mutilate a crossword puzzle.  This is typical for him, the boy is not right *small grin*...  I returned home with all the intentions of completely cleaning the car but laundry still distracted me.  My son arrived home for lunch so we went the Chok for chinese food.  Actually it's the China Wok but at night the ina W is out on their sign, Chok...  Yeahhhh...  Came home, vacuumed and did what everyone who eats Chinese food does, took a nap.  Woke up, finished the laundry finally, drank half a gallon of water (lunch...), and pretty much sums up the day.  In other words, besides getting the bed made, straightening up some, vacuuming, and laundry, I did basically shit today.  *shrugs*... Don't know, maybe in the scheme of all things, we all need a day or two like that.  I do feel pretty un-accomplished (no, that is not a proper word) tonight though and that's my own hang ups gnawing at me.  I'll deal with it...

"event","i don't know what the hell is wrong with me.  i should be focusign on step 2, but no.  I'm busy break up with boyfriends, thinking about ex-bfs when i know i shouldn't, daydreaming about trips thru england and europe, scoping out friends who could help out with those trips, namely natives. Oh my FUCKING lord, just snap out of. it's getting you nowhere in all aspects of life. 

here's how it is. mike will never love you how you want him to. he loves medicine more than he had loved you. remember in that conversation not too long ago that you established that he wouldn't follow you wherever you went. you know, fairly well that you're not good with long distance, that you need that 24/7 bf. even if you had lasted this long, and you guys were busing it back adn forth btwn richmond and nyc... chances are he's still be applying for residency in cali.  besides that communication btwn the two you even when you were dating wasn't that great. a phone call here and there. even when things were called off and he promised to call more, but instead they were few and far between.  no webcam convos, not a single one.  he will always be there for you... and you should cherish that, but it will always be in that back burner/ friendly way.  deep down you will always feel like his charity case or feel like you're part of this one-sided friendship.  never letting you in. 

nick. holy crap did you put him thru the ringer. you tore him a new one comparing him to bf past and for what. he loves you so completely it's sickening and i know you're taking that for granted. he's will to stick with you while you shove that fact that you're not dating anymore in his face. he's willing to continue fighting for you... and i mean in a real way, not like guys who say it and really don't do much.  he wants to change for you.  he has made some great strides. prob the only guy you dated who has actually changed.  that alone speaks volumes of him.  he wants to be with you... he'll follow you to ANY residency, even is that means he's sacrificing a better residency for himself. and he's aware that my scores dont work in his favor.

so there.  why isn't the choice easy?!  you fucking nimwhit.  and the worst part is that you're bringing this all on yourself. you had to be this free-spirited oh-i-can-make-things-work and mend things up. friggin idiot, why did you pick up the phone and dial you're ex-bf number?  as if you didn't cause him enough suffering when you broke up with him.  pour salt in his wound why don't you.  you know what it is? it's karma... i broke his heart... and now i'm is this state of emotional limbo.

why did you call him? you just... got off peds early that week. ARGH! ROAR!"

and of course, it comes at a time when i have more than a few things on my plate: step 2 ck, residency apps, LORs, $$$, weddings, missing seeing my sister and brother off to college.  i dont even have the time to write in a journal, but i think i might just go insane if i don't.  so here i am... thinking about talking about it.  thinking..."

"event","i've been going thru a rough time these past few months, esp these past few days.  i dont think anyone keeps track of this blog anyone and it's just as well. 

it's just the most bizarre of things that happen to me.  my family is falling apart before my very eyes... and it was i who who started the ball rolling.  not that i did anything wrong.  i didnt do anything wrong.  i knew of the consequences of my actions but a lie ... how long before that unfurls?  i'll be as vague as possible.  it's only been a week - one hard week.  i see my mom in these new light - so calm, so collected, in rare form.  she's the epitome of what i want to be.  strong.  i'll get there soon enough.  right now i'm a firecrackers with a descent length fuse.  

that's probably the worst of my problems.

anish... yeah i wont be vague about this one... anish is being a bitch. holy crap. i'm gonna talk about it here and forget about his ass.  that's it. he's wasted so much of my time.  and i'll immortalize my feelings about him here.  4 years relationship. 2 years friendship shat on.  proposes to a girl he loves within 2 weeks of meeting her. congratulations!  here's the clincher. he cant ever talk to me again. ok, ok... i can take one for the team.  tells me he loves her more than me. alright... that sounds right.  you should love the woman your gonna marry.  i accepted it and i'll admit there was a little squabble.  i was understandably upset he just disposed of me like a dirty paper napkin and wrote him a very girly email about it.  more months pass by... respectfully, we havent talked. but he drops me a msg saying he and his fiance would like to meet me in boston.  i wasnt quite ready, plus i was in seattle, los angeles, etc.  but when i was ready i gave him the dates i'd be in town up until i was leaving the country.  no answer back... was his suggestion for a meeting a fluke?  i dont really care.  i was more like 'phew!'  bec knowing anish, he'd dismiss the fact that i was happy for him and instead rub it in my face that he found someone before i did.  i'm just picturing a really uncomfortable situation and imagining myself inviting tammy and feigning homosexuality. 


whatever... who cares right... but somehow he figured out i got into med school and called my phone the day i was flying out.  random but appreciated.  but then we're back to not talking again.  ok, i get it.  one time deal.  now we get to the most ridiculous part. FACEBOOK!  he puts up his engagement pictures.  they're nice.  i use this as an opportunity to ice break.  i comment:  she's gorgeous! but why arent you smiling? it's your engagement. look at her! smile! or something to the affect.  he msgs me with this gawd awful public msg.... someone's jealous!  i took 400 pictures. i couldnt post them all. blah blah blah... HAVE YOU SEEN WHY WIFE?!  me and mike read that msg and were like wtf!  DELETED!

my last attempt to make good bec i have patience so long that it can run down the nile river and still have slack. anish vora's birthday was june 18th.  thought i'd be nice, bought him a facebook gift, sent it to him with a message that simply said - happy birthday, ani!  he deleted it. and posted a thank you note for the birthday wishes, tagging anyone who wished him a happy birthday EXCEPT me.   this was a nice gesture on my part. and it's the last attempt i make at salvaging a friendship. 


funny thing is that i know he'll love her with all his heart... but he'll do stuff like buy her a platinum ring with princess cut diamonds - that seems sweet right? ... until you find out that that was what i wanted.  i'm not sure he did that... but it sure sounds like something he would do

sigh. the end of the anish saga."

"event","relationships havent gotten easier.  i'm older and dating my third... 

after the train crash of a relationship that thankfully ending last year, i have have absolutely no tolerance for anything with the current.  he's morally adjusted, considerate and a good friend - things the last one wasnt.  overall he's a better bf than the last one, so why am i less patient.  

desensitized, more cynical and more apt to beleive that effort doesnt correlate to the success of relationship, i am who i am now. 

i love him.  


i dunno.  
i see patterns of behavior that have been addressed but still persist.  annoyed that having been addressed these issues still exists, immediately i think wth some people just dont change. BUT overall the problems are miniscual compared to the train wreck. 

it's not for a lack of effort. right.  it still pisses me off. it's like when dad tells you not to watch tv to close... you move away.  next day youre two inches away from the tube.  BOP! what did i tell you about sitting too close to the tv.  you remember ... or you just watch for dad's footsteps next time. either way you dont watch tv closely IN FRONT OF HIM.  so why do something that would piss me off.  i know he doesnt do it to piss me off.

sigh. i'm looking at him now.  i dunno if he's truly happy.  i've pushed and pushed.  i know i'm this complete bitch.  i'm always picking on him and attacking him and i know it's excessive and it's stupid.  he just never pushes back. i dont have that resistence and so like any unopposed force of nature i just keep going. 

and i guess the question is whether i'm happy or not. i could be.  if there were some equality in this relationship and i know i shouldnt complain but i wish he werent so nice.  he's like a shock absorber.  he takes it and just swallows it.  i think that makes it worse bec there has to be some kind of instinctive emotional response and i want it out.  and i will escalate it until it comes out.  if he has this gut reaction to something i do, and we're in a relationship and he hides it, that doesnt make us any closer.

one of the few things i've learned from past relationships is that you're not doing anyone any favors by keeping emotions- things that bother you - inside. it's not self sacrificing and it's not noble.  why? bec the person will continue doing those things that bother you and they wont know. off topic... doesnt really relate to what's bothering me. 

you know break ups are probably the easiest part of a relationship.  one party deal.  no compromise... it's one decision made by one person to shake up 2 lives. 

i dont know what's bothering me. actually i prob do.  it's the irrationality of it all. it's 4:30am and i need sleep.  eyes are dry."

"event","smooth sailing so far.  gonna meet up with mike in nyc and do what we do best:  the touristy thing... except of course, we have both been to ny several times.  he, being the seasoned traveler and 4 years my senior, has been there many more times than i.  hotels there are friggin expensive.  the westin in boston was 140 a night... in nyc it's 300 and upwards.  i think the cheapest one i've found was the red roof inn.  decent, classy and right by central park.  

i think the westin in boston is the best hotel i have expereinced by far.  the pool and  jacuzzi could use some cleaning but the the continental breakfast and aerial view of boston are to die for.  their heavenly bed is truly heavenly.  

anyways... as i was saying.  nyc, baby! :o)  i want to at least see a broadway show.  i've already seen rent, so maybe chicago or the producers.  take a long stroll thru central park. maybe stop by the wax museum... and get a better look at lady liberty.  see how wtc memorial is doing too.  i've already sat in on the letterman show.  visit some friends namely ed, gobind, sheraz and daisy and  if mike wants his friends and family too.  and to top it off eat some ny style pizza or gelato.  exciting stuff! yay!  i bought a map the other day complete with subway map.  it'll just be like old times (a couple of months ago) when me and mike were traveling through italy or when i was trying to get around paris by myself :o) YAY!

got an interview at st. george.  looks like i will most likely be in the caribbean for medical school.  not bad, eh?  i'm on hold for 3 other schools (uvm, penn state, and albany)... and i'm waiting to hear from 7 others.  it's march. it's late. i'm getting nervous... but at least i have st. george to fall back on.  the interview is on tuesday at 8am in brockton.  

work:  paul just asked me to come to seattle in may for a couple of weeks to help set up shop... and get this... ALL EXPENSES PAID.  airfare and apartment.  how often does this happen... well for me it's happened twice in less than a year.  once for switzerland and now once for seattle.  it looks like i will be visiting cali this summer after all too ;o)

and lastly this summer i will be in vn for at least 3 weeks.  man... the only thing with that is i won't be bringing any money in.  i think my dad wants the three of us (me and the sibs) there for 5 weeks... thats 3000 (excluding taxes) dollars that could have been put in a bank or put towards paying off a loan.  26,000 in the hole as of today ... which isn't bad for a lady who's been in school for the last 6 years of her life.  

:) life is good. i just wish my realtime would work.

"event","this week i found out that both my ex boyfriends resumed their lives and are happily devoted to someone new.  for many girls, this would be enough to ruin your day, week, mood.  i admit that this double whammy news made cringe.  who wouldnt feel that way? the normal motions are denial, anger, sorrow, acceptance.  one begins to wonder what the heck was wrong with me? what is she like?  is she prettier than me? what does he enjoy about her that i didn't have?  well, i didn't think any of that (although now i am).  my first thoughts were: good for them.  maybe they can be happy.

my superb friend jacob hodes once said: never let go of a good thing.  and so far, i haven't.  i left both relationships knowing it would be better that way... either he wasn't the guy - well i guess that's the only reason so far - and very good friendships developed thereafter.

as for not talking to anish... i'm accepting it more and more as time goes by.  i would want a husband that stands by his wife and that's exactly what he's doing.  although i have my doubts about her, i don't know her... but this decision seems too hasty, but then again i also believe in *knowing* that a person is right for you from the moment you meet them.  and if indeed this is the real thing, i wouldn't want to stand in their way.  i am a small sacrifice for love. and i hope you are happy, anish :.)  hope you have a long and happy marriage.

i decided to try out a long distance relationship.  not officially hitched yet, but definitely feeling the weight of it all.  i am realizing that i am more high maintenance than i thought i was.  i require attention and affection... more so to compensate for the distance.  and yes distance does make the heart grow fonder.  there are some advantages to a long distance relationship.  you tend _not_ to get caught up on the small and petty things.  you appreciate each others presence a lot more.  and you focus less on the physical and more on the emotional.  me and mike webcam almost every night sometimes it can be a bit much esp when one of us is working on something, but it's always a good option to have.  we webcammed for new year's.  i dolled up and he dressed in his suit and we poured our wine/ apple cider and celebrate new year's on the east and west coast times.  it was nice. :)  the thing i really like about us is that he was my very good friend first and someone i was attracted to second.  i always thought the best relationships started off that way. 

oh and i got a raise this week.  i'm very happy about that.  now i can afford that shiny new schwinn bike i always wanted.  to top that off my old boss, michael (detmar) has asked me to help him finish off a project for a very competitive paper.  wait for it... AND HE OFFERED TO PAY FOR MY STAY AND FLIGHT TO ZURICH!  i was already planning my trip to the mountains to skydive and hit the bars with the old roommates, when i reread the email and realized there may be a small possibility that i might just end up doing the work in boston.  who cares?  it's nice just to know that my talents in the lab are well appreciated. 

i went in a date with mike (reinstein) and siv to end the week off.  actually i think the proper terms in 3rd wheel.  siv saw mike on my friendster buddy list.  she thought he was cute.   we went to kowloons off route one. good asian food.  i was the acting ice breaker. ... i don't think either one is interested in the other though, but maybe new friendships have developed (if you haven't figured it out yet, i'm big on friendships)


i miss some of my friends... tom, tammy, chrissie, anna, sean, hash, darragh... where does time go? sigh

anyways. eventful week."

"event","within the past week i have discovered that *both* my ex-boyfriends are in relationships... serious or not i do not know.  

and i admit i was a little hurt... not bec they had moved on or any of that nonsense... but bec they didn't tell me.  i found out that both were ""in relationships"" as they put it on thefacebook, a popular network of college students that allows members to tag their friends. and now they even have an option where you can state how you know a person, for how long, and under what pretense. it goes as far as to detail relationships, breakups and current status of relationship.  i digress... i was hurt bec i found out the way i did.  i thought that we were closer than that and after having the same conversation with the two of them about being open to each other and wanting to know when the other was dating again... blah blah blah (i bought into it. i revealed).  yeah... just a little disappointed.

anyhow... this all seems trivial now bec in the middle of this entry i picked up the phone and talked to anish.  current events - his parents *arranged* for him to meet a girl.  she was to spend 3 weeks with them over the holidays and return to LA.  anish proposed to her on new year's eve at times square.  yay, anish! :)  i'm really happy for him.  don't fuck it up.

anyways... i've forgotten what i was upset about.  i'm so happy for anish.  and his deciding moment was when he realized he loved her more than he loved me.  solid..."

"event","i have tolerated a lot of lame shit in my past relationships... let me just summarize what FOR ME when the beginning of the end becomes evident.  usually it's when one of three cornerstones fail: love, communication, trust.


LOVE
there are many types. the love you have a friend, for a parent, for a child. the love you have for a former gf/bf, for your current lover, for the ONE... all different. but what comes with all types of love is a universal respect for one another... unconditional concern and care.  and it comes in all sorts of fun forms.  walking you home (darragh, hash, and mike) and if unable to walk, a phonecall to make sure you got home alright (hash).  soup when youre sick (bobby), making sure you got drugs and button up (anish and blondie), wishing you a SAFE trip, calling just to hear your voice, beautiful messages, thoughtful gifts, flowers ... and the comments, jokes, and nonsense to cheer you up ... this includes crazy dances, moonings, kisses, bear hugs.  <sigh>  i am indeed loved :)   this part's no sweat.

COMMUNICATION
this keeps you connected. this keeps you good friends long after a bad break up.  this is what can be worked on and if you suck at it still, you're outta luck.  misunderstanding breeds distrust and we can't have that.  i do a good job in this dept most of the time.  my relationship with bobby re-emphasized its importance and now i'm better for having dated him.

a lot of people open up to me in confidence revealing embarrassing details of their lives or things they're not so proud of.  in this respect i am a good friend.  i listen.  i try not to judge but if you're completely insane i'll put my 2 cents in and it won't be subtle.  this is how many of my close friendships are and i don't expect any less in a relationship.  it's an expectation.  if you have something to hide or something you cant tell me, be assured that i will notice and i will be offended and standoffish about it.  

fine, so you forgot to mention a few things to me... but then it becomes a habit and then i begin to feel like you've left me out of parts of your life... that you don't think about me or more importantly US that much. strike against intimacy. strike against communication. blaring signal: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.  it's even worse if your partner can't even come to you when it's certain that there are things on their mind that bug them.  it's my understanding if you're dating someone that they inadvertantly become your best friend... the first person you go to, the person you vent to, the one who helps you cope.  can't come to me?  you might as well not consider me a friend.  if it's something small, then it shouldn't even bother you.

the closest person, the person who knows me best is anish.  he knows exactly how much to push and when to bug off.  he knows how i think, the processes behind them, he even know when i'm lying. i love him. at some point we shared passwords and after 2 years post break up, he still knows me better than anyone and all this is a resutl of the communication we had on our relationship.

TRUST
this is something i've come to learn isn't some you can just grant someone right off the bat.  the benefit of the doubt will only take you so far.  dependable... meaning there has to be a situation where they were dependable.   you counted on them and they met your expectations. different types of trust, of course.  i can trust bobby not to scratch my laptop if he borrowed it. i can trust anna to be there with a listening ear when i need some female companionship.   i can count on anish for sympathy and love. i can count on jimmy to give me the brutal truth.  again... different types of trust... but what i'm reelly talking is about the trust you share in a relationship (of course, why else would i be writing anyways).  be perseptive. 

jealousy is an entirely different thing."

"event","i am not on birth control and am probably one of the last of my kind.  do you understand my hesitation?

what does it mean to be on bc?  you open yourself to unprotected sex, practically welcoming it. you, the girl are solely responsible for not getting pregnant and if you do get pregnant, isn't it the automatic assumption that it's more your fault?  bec you must have ""missed a pill"" or something depending on which bc you're taking.  i've heard too many guys blame on the girlfriend: she's trying to trap me into marrying her... it's her fault... NO IDIOT! IT'S YOUR F-ING SPERM.  IT WAS YOUR PENIS INSIDE HER. AND IT WAS YOU WHO KNEW THE RISKS. 

i have always had a strong feminist side. i don't tolerate stupidity... and have even less patience with sexist stupidity in combination with casting blame.

anways... to me a physical barrier is better than a hormonal one.  the side effects are numerous... from the desireable bigger boobs and clearer skin to the health problem causing blood clots and death (this from the patch).  what are the risks?   you're puttign more estrogen and progesterone in your body... inhibiting FSH and LH and thus the release of the egg.  what ever the long term effects of that, i dunno... but increased estrogen are associated with pms and menopause.  if you've ever had a gf you don't want to be around for that.  

alternative: the nuvaring... introduced in 2001 is a vaginal ring that you leave in for 3 weeks, wait a week and bleed, then insert a new one. it releases small doses of an estrogen and progestin, just like the pill.  as noted on their website side effects include headaches, nausea, and breast tenderness, a low incidence of breakthrough bleeding.  still relatively brand spanking new.  we'll wait until it's a little more mature before we try that.  the patch sucked, and it was a more direct way of admistering these hormones... this probably will too. 



another option: approved in 1992 (so still relatived new) Depo-Provera injections ever 12 weeks.  each injection contains a dose of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate equaling 150 mg. The drug causes ovulation to cease by decreasing FSH/LH levels and also a low LH surge. Interestingly, a cervical mucus, much similar to that caused by Norplant (which is an implant that i've eliminated as an option), occurs in order to prevent semen from entering the uterus.  this is good if you want to avoid estrogen side effects. a plus! still need to read up on that.


so as it stands... i am not on birth control and those of you who are shouldn't be alarmed because of my posting.  i'm just trying to be thorough and i'd rather look at all the negative before poisoning  my body.  i'd rather just stick with condoms and avoid this all together... but you gotta consider all the other options. and it's just good to know anyways as an aspiring physician. 


and if you're a chick on bc... gimme your input.  i don't have many female friends who are willing to talk about this. 

love,

traditionally the wife takes the husband's last name... but what if it's a ridiculous last name like focker... martha focker.  yeah, that's not really what i'm concerned about. my pi's situation has recently brought this topic to the table.  he and his wife have this very modern arrangement.  their first child took Paul's (my PI) last name.  so he's alex lee nghiem.  their second one however, took his wife's last name: mac nghiem lee.  this is a wonderful compromise between the two, but i'll say the kids should at least have the same last names.  i'm not to cool with the hyphenated name... even if i was, it would still be an issue of whose last name should go first. i do however see practicality is keep one's own last name... professionally.  as an author, actor, lawyer, dentist, and physician your name is your business.  and that's why i've made an agreement with myself that i will keep the last name that appears on my MD. that gives whoever 5 years from now to marry me.  

i like my last name. the single-double syllable goes well.  i think my name would eb awful it was a single-single combo... do you know how short my name would be?"

"event","ok....
need a little break.  been working on my essay for a couple of days now and i'm just not good at writing about myself because i dont want to seem too cocky or overconfident or look like i'm embellishing... more modest.  but you have to embellish.  most people aren't stellar candidates with a 4.0 and a 45 mcat. but yeah, i am average.  if i could get it on personality alone, this would be so much easier. 

and then there's the md/phd essay.  just logged into a forum yesterday only to be discouraged.  better off going one or the other not both. mudphuds are mudphuds bec they can't figure out want they want to do.  clinical to laboratory time is 20:80.  and you're just better off getting a fellowship after your md.  so why am i considering an md/phd.  bec i see myself doing research  in the future. but i want patient contact first and foremost. what to do?  some of the things i read are prob true.  you can't be a good physcian and a good scientist under the pressures of meeting grant deadlines, writing papers adn seeing patients on a daily basis.  not gonna work.  so i ask again what do i do?  do i do the md route or the md/phd route.  i guess right now it's just strategy.  what makes me a good candidate is my research experience and my connections to md/phd and phd and some of the medical schools.  so usc, northwestern, standford, uwash, harvard. hahaha... i won't get into any of those schools.  

and can i say that sex complicates things. 180! hahaha.  i will be content being celibate for the next few YEARS of my life.  i can be very happy with my showerhead. hahaha...  we all seek companionship and i have that and i'm happy with what i have.  

there are always 2 sides to what i have to say.  there's what i say, or would like to beleive is true... and there's what i really think/ my prediction of what will probably happen.  more times than not my intuition wins out over my stubborness.  either way the outcome rarely surprises, and usually peeves me that i can't control everything around me. 

random thoughts... we are products of our past relationships.  you can thank my former bf for my talents ... as well as flaws... but i think you'll find that i've refined a lot of things and have dimmed the anger and jealousy that you often experience in the wonderful world of dating.  i'm not sure if that's a good thing?  i don't think i could tolerate jealousy for very long after swearing it off.  yeah... tangent.

italy rocks... can't believe i was there... and next is what???? paris!!!! hell yeah.  who would ever dream that i could take a weekend trip to paris and come back home to switzerland and then take another weekend trip to some other gorgeous place.  and can i remind you that i'm getting paid to live in switzerland?!  doesn't get much better than this... well i could go into business, travel for free, and use my sex appeal to get what i want out of clients. that could be better, right???? maybe.  

good enough break.  you think i would be keeping a travel journal.  but with the number of places i visited in a short span of time... i 1. can't remember the names of these places, 2. didn't have time to write a journal and 3. too many place to name, which is why i don't really want to sort out my bagillion pictures and send them out to my friends and make them uber jealous.

i wish i could back to those days where my heart would skip a beat at the cheesiest action.  those days where you were on cloud nine for the entire day because he touched your hand while grabbing for your pencil.  those days where your notebook was plastered with i heart <name of boy>.  those days where you missed a boy within one hour of departure.  what happened?

it's called the been-there-done-that syndrome... which is why your first love is seemingly the strongest love you'll ever experience.  love is not dead.  i'm just not as excited about new relationships anymore.  sure... i kinda do the girly ""awwww"" thing when i see a couple holding hands or kissing in public... public displays of affection are wonderful.  but you come to a point where the za-za-za-zing ain't happening anymore.  for me at least, there are motions you go through-

*honeymoon stage*
initiation: kissing.... lots and lots of kissing... hours of it.  i love this!  
            pretending .... laugh a little harder, smile a little more, put some cologne on, do your hair ... it's a ritual
            dates .... dinner and movies... that is, if you get through the movie 
            groping.... yeah yeah, we know where that leads

*let's get real*
propagation: steady dating
            hang out a lot more ... probably sticking around the apt, cooking, cleaning
            sharing everything... drinks, beds, underwear
            getting to know each other ... secrets, past relationships, flaws
            figuring out what bugs you... followed by on and off bickering
            expectation that there is no other than the significant other ... develops tension/ breeds jealousy

*cue credits*
terminations: fights become repetetive
            thoughts of finding someone 'better' loom around
            someone gets selfish and finally
            puts their foot down and courageously establishes that the relationship is OVER

THE END!

we know how the story goes ... which brings me to the point of why bother dating? right. to find mr. right... i'm tired of this idea of a mr. right.  who said that there was a mr. right?  i bet some guy did, who thought ""heh, some chick with beleive this and hook up with as many guys as she can to find him.""  what an evil plan.... so you get married... then what... you have kids... then what... you retire and you're stuck with each other for all eternity, to be buried next to each other or on top of one another.  this is would be a nice life if there wasn't a HUGE possibility that you'd grow to hate the person after 25 years.  so again, what's the point.... why risk losing half your investments in a divorce settlement?  why have kids that you'll have to fight for who prob will look like HIM? that a--hole!  hahaha. 

ok ok. i'm not entirely.  but i really hate how tedious dating can be. that you spend a couple of years of your life with someone to find out that you'll be going your separate ways.  and then start over new with someone new, knowing the same thing could happen.  isn't that a waste of time?  sure you can make yourself feel better and think well it was a learning experience.  tell yourself it's about the journey, not the destination.  that in the years you were dating joe schmoe, something good came out of it, chosing to ignore all the bad that came along with the good.  bah hum bug.  it's all a stupid game... a dance we perform to pass time by. 

so what's the alternative? to do the casual thing.  that has a whole slew of different problems.  let's see.... people get attached, they get hurt. friends with benefits, problems with commitment. life just becomes complicated, grey, and damn right confusing.

what happened to puppy love days.  :(  lynh's got too much baggage and security ain't letting her into the land of love.  doesn't customs usually take away suspicious/injurious baggage?  confiscate it... and burn it, please!

i'm a firm believer that things happen for a reason...  that bad things happen for a reason, that you meet people for a reason.
i have my theories of why i've met the people i've met.  i can tell you all of them make me a stronger as a person because all them have either made me question my values or solidify them ... have either facilitated progression or stalled it for thorough thought by posing the alternative.  

everyone has a meaning to my life.  why did i meet you?  i could tell you, but i can't promise i'll tell you every reason, mainly because they are very personal reasons and depending on who you are, i don't think i would afford you the liberty of knowing that you touched or maybe just nudged me in some direction.   

it's like crying. if you are the reason why i'm crying, chances are i'll try to hide it from you and try my damn best to hold the tears back ... because letting you see me cry is allowing you to see something very personal, very vunerable about me and because you are the reason why i cry, it's admitting that you have an affect on me.   that in itself is power.  i'd rather be this stoic type in the moment and then run home and cry into my pillow... which i've a couple of occasions... recently... or go to a friend.  

anyhow... over the past couple of years, i've resolved to saying ""i dunno"" less and less... because more times than not, it's not true.  i do know and think a lot of people overuse that phrase or submit to not knowing because they don't want to think about it or figure it out - a cop out.  it's probably the phrase i hate most.  it's the wishy washiness i've tried to eliminate (:o) ani)


reading all these journal entries, jeez... i do think about a lot things... a lot of stupid things

i could tell you why i met you ... whether i think it was to benefit me or you or both
i could tell you what song reminds me of you ... or if choosing your ringtone, what it would be and why
i could tell you what i was thinking when i first met you
worst flaws, what about you makes me smile/ annoys the shit out me, what type of person i see you marrying...
i could tell you about my bad habits, guilty pleasures, why i lead a paradoxical life, \my opinion is on everything, why i'm passive in some aspects but so aggressive on other fronts... all this i know and to say i don't know, is most likely NOT TRUE - but don't go asking me these questions, because i'm probably not willing to share of them with you ... ie you'd be surprised of what i have to say.

i'm telling you all my secrets.  wth is there more to know about me, right? no mystery left... riiiiight.... hahahahah
i'm just figuring out who i am... what my gut response is to things and why... testing my resiliency, to see how much before i break. 


like... this whole love thing.... i'm scared shitless of it but i cant stop loving people.  and so i keep people at a distance.  i've caught myself a couple times with the l-word dangling fromg the cusp of my lips ready to float into the wrong ears.  and it's not that i normally say i love you on a daily basis... it naturally comes out when i finally feel it.  and right now, i'm like: PUT A CAP ON IT! BAD IDEA!

it's almost entertaining to be in my head. never really that boring.  maybe one day someone will understand me totally or name a syndrome after me.

"event","""boys will come and go but friends are forever.  i wish that were true all the time.  


you know when a friendship is in murky shark-invested waters when you can't share everything with them.  that blows... esp for me, bec i blab about everything, thoroughly think about everything, and am pretty open to talk about just about everything, including bowel movements and menses. friendships are something i value and i really do get weepy when i forsee one ... becoming less than my ideal, which is inevitable.  they move away or become distant. we don't talk as frequently... and the friendship becomes one-sided ... and that blows chunks for me bec i'm the type of person who shares when people share... then it just becomes a self-fulling profecy... a flat, stale *friendship*

i don't need anymore of those.  i've gotten close to a few people, opened up to them, had them open up to me.  i think i'm a pretty apporachable person and easy to talk to... so why would i settle for a *flat and stale frienship.*  ok... so a lot of you are reading this and wondering if i consider our friendship one of those.  i probabaly do if you haven't talked to me at all in the past month.  i do make the effort to keep some afloat ... but this is a two person job.  i guess it doesn't bother me too much.  it happens all the time, right?  and then you make new friends.  those who stay are the ones you invite to your wedding (or marry!), develop deeper relationships with that make the significant other jealous, and would want to see smile once more before you die.  that's something to look forward to.  :o)

for once i've come out of a journal entry feeling the complete opposite.  so what? we close another chapter of our lives where people come and go, to open another one where old friedships remain and the stale ones rot away... hahaha, cutting our losses.  it's not all that bad.  




you know what hash said... he described me as a tom boy, tough on the outside but soft on the inside.... emotional and girly girl.  hahaha.  i guess that's the image i've wanted to portray.  that girl in the movies who's just rough around the edges, couldn't care less about makeup and doing her hair... a jock, a seemingly strong female who runs for class president, is captain of the football and track teams, is in the running for class valedictorian, never having dated a boy... and then one day she shows up to the prom in this gorgeous dress, all angelina jolie-like and somewhere from the dance floor to the limo ride home she reveals her softer side and she cries.  ok... so i don't fit this picture-esque desciption completely... but i don't think by caking on the make-up or wearing low-cut shirt or pants that show off the tho- tho- tho- thong are attractive.  i'd much rather meet a guy while wearing a t-shirt and jeans, wearing my geeky glasses and some chapstick.  at least he wouldn't be surprised to see me in all my glory when i just wake up in the mornings (actually i think i look my best when i just wake up) without the running mascara. i wouldn't be this completely different person... and i wouldn't have to worry about him staring down my boobs (what little i have)... leaving my personality a fighting chance. :)

"event","someone shoot me.  i've become the girl i pity. the one that has been tramatized by some boy-related situation and can't seem to get over it.  

i'm this mindless individual wondering around hating all things male, claiming that she'll never date again, or that maybe marriage isn't something for her.  what a pity... to actually beleive that i would be happy growing alone with my cat norman;  to sacrifice wedding bells, motherhood, and a family because one bad experience; to have no hope in the male species because one screwed up... 

it's a bit depressing.  what's worse is that the profession i have chosen is one that doesn't allow for lasting relationships.  here's a pattern.  to date one guy through undergrad. move away. break up.  date another guy during grad school.  move away. break up... here's my prediction: date another guy during med school. move away.  break up.  another guy during residency. move away. break up.  YES! wtf! i used to beleive that if you found the right person that long distance wouldn't be much but a small inconvenience.  that phonecalls everynight saying i love you and sweet dreams would be enough. i actually did that for four years.  even made recorded letters on microcassette to add some creativity to correspondences.  things would come naturally.  love and trust would get us through.  in hs, i remember thinking that long distance is such a stupid reason to break up... because really it meant that you didn't give the relationship a chance (jacob and kathia come to mind).  but then again, these are hs relationships that graduate to curiousity for college relationships. now as a 23 year old, almost 24, i've attained the cynicism that is confused with ""knowing better.""

i just hope i get out of this rut... i hope i don't always find growing old alone appealing.  i hope that i won't be afraid to let a guy in.  man, i've been stripped of a lot my innocence.  will i have intimacy problems too?  inability to commit?  sabotage every possibilty of happiness?  it looks like i've already started down this path.  what an ugly web i weave.  

it never ceases to amaze me that i can so easily remove myself from my situation and reflect on it logically. it's so weird. 

it's just so disheartening to know that the one guy you want is at the end of a series of many dramatic tear-jerking endings.  it's not enough that you try so hard for one relationship to last... to give the benefit of the doubt all the time, to be as understanding as you can, and show that you care about someone in so many ways ... and find that it wasn't appreciated or reciprocated, but taken for granted.  i'm just soo tired of it.  to baby guys and think it's cute ... but realize it's all a matter of convenience.  i'm not really thinking of any boy in particular... but reflecting on all the interactions i have with guys.  infidelity is another issue... jim, bill, dan, rob, dick.   so easy to do, and thus not easy to trust.

why is this process so tedious? why must we date poopie heads to figure out how assemble the right mr. potatoe head for us.   i should probably be used to this... this no guarantee thing... you know, med school, conducting research, medicine in general... i should be an expert in this field. THERE ARE NO GUARANTTEES IN LIFE.  watch out world.  lynh is ready to tell you to f*ck off.  

i'm just bitter tonight.  probably pmsing as some may claim. to you, i say ""psh!""


i just want someone to wish me goodnight everynight; to look back when we part;  to wipe the tears off my face and give me a bear hug; to share secrets with;  to make me feel beautiful not because of the skin deep, but because my full being is appreciated ... that last one is hard.  
goodnight all.

i'm sure the fact that today, the 10 year anniversity of my first ""relationship"" may have stirred some unsettlign issues for me."

"event","is it too much to ask for the full package?
are the friends you have of the opposite sex, your friends because they were at some point interested in you or vice versa?

i'm watching the average joe... it's a reality show where they pin up a group of your average joes against a group of models and jocks.  the two groups compete for one girl... one hot looking girl, with a heart i haven't yet figured out.  the sad part is that a girl that good looking isn't going to go for the plump and hairy with chunky glasses.  no one would. 

i'd like to say that personality is what girls look for, but i would be lying.  every relationship that i pursued was intially about good looks...  one of the few times i was attracted to someone because of his personality, did it end up in a romance? no. we were friends for a few years and then one day it just clicked.  i didn't really say anything to him until the year after we graduated and you know what???  he was totally crushing over me too... how little things have changed... how i'm such a wuss isnt the point of this journal entry though.

how stupid is it that we go for the overrated good-looks and great body with the attached face of brad pitt.  brad pitt, HAH!  how dumb is it that we know what path we follow and continue with the same cycle.  i think that there's something about being a good looking individual, that on some level you think you can do better, or can find someone better looking, (basically you're just full of yourself)or ... if you are dating a good looking person, you cling on because you think you couldn't better, or jealousy becomes a problem because you know the other could get anyone they wanted.  good looks just make a person likeable... but in all reality it's the personality that makes a relationship last.  it's so dumb that a relationship can last as long as it can based on good looks.

so i've heard about three storied about marriages that have hit the 25 year mark and now are expereincing rocky waters.  i had a conversation with a recently divorced male about marriages and i think he has a good point.  a lot of people marry out of lust.  that's perhaps *love* as many of us claim to know is really just a chemical reaction brought upon a person by something appealing whether it be great sex, good looks, **an image** (rich, physician with house by the water) of what they want in a marriage. and that image fades... and perhaps it is all chemical, something else that fades. 

maybe pre-arranged marriages are the way to go... let me just put that out there... i'm not saying ""hey, mom, dad, sign me up.""  divorce rates are the highest in america. why is that? is marriage not something sacred anymore? are more people feeling like marriage is JUST something next on the list to accomplish or naturally progress to after dating for a long duration of time.  are americans not percieving ""til death do you part"" as a serious vow they make to themselves and their partner? or are americans just viewing divorce similiar to breaking up, an easy option to take when things aren't working out.  people do it 2, 3, 4 times.  WHY? HOW!?  how can you say ""you're the one for me"" to more than ONE person?  perhaps the idea of THE ONE is just a suped up idea of who you're supposed to marry.  maybe you're supposed to marry someone that you wouldn't *mind* living the rest of your life with... heh?

sometimes the choices we make in our own lives are better decided by people who don't have a vested interest in them.  someone who's not under the spell of lust, that can see the good and the bad things about a match up, and most importantly are genuinely concerned about the concern of whoever is involved.  

so to answer the question of: is it too much to ask for the full package of fantastic personaliy plus attractive looks?  my answer is... something's gotta give.  good looks fade with age. core personalities don't change ... so i guess it depends if you want someone who will tide you over until the next one or if you want someone in your life for the long run.

as for the second question. i dont know if i have any friendships with the opposite sex that were ... in it's entirety ... friendships. (except for sean, who's my best friend with pride) i guess i shouldn't complain... the best friendships i have probably have come from physical attractions.

you know when you are IN LOVE when:

1. he's the only person you wanna be with
2. he's the first thing on your mind when you wake up, and the last thing on your mind when you go to bed
3. he buys you presents for no reason, and you do the same
4. you wake in the middle of the night and look for him to give a kiss
5. you look at him and think wow, i'm lucky ... for so many reasons
6. you can look into each others and feel secure about each other
7. he's your bestfriend
8. the thought of hurting him, pains you
9. not judgemental, not selfish, patient... can be completely open with him
10. you're done checking out other guys
11. you can use his toothbrush
12. you would be there for him and he for you, no questions asked, NONE
13. you take each other for granted because you can
14. he's one of the only people who can hurt you
15. can't live a day without him (this will be hard one to attain)
16. you wanna have his kids
17. you can see yourself growing old with him, and still holding hands
18. willing to compromise to make things works or agree to disagree... bec otherwise we've hit a roadblock
19. makes me want to be a better person, challenges me
20. is motivated in life... his work, his health, his family
21. looks will only get you so far... i have the tendency to be most attracted to guys when they are engrossed and passionate about something they are talking about
22. unconditional love

practicality... logistics... reality. i almost feel like i've been caught up in all of it.  let's consider how spikey hair and chin fuzz would feel.  how would pink bikini react... or curly sue.  and the reprecussions of it all.  how others would view your actions?  how they would make you feel... instead of how you feel about the desicion or if you really have yourself wrapped up around the situation the right way.  i mean... why can't i just enjoy my life without this side considerations or concerns of judgement.  <shakes her head>  life is too damn short.  i wish i were the person that would make that dive without thinking about it so much... for once... just once, no worries.  

i've lost trust in people.  why can i just not care... blow it off as spilled milk. not feel betrayed, insulted, wronged.  why dangle things in front of yourself when you know you're not ready to have it yet.  why not cut your losses and NOT bring those into your future that should be left in the past.

come to find out that me and my dad are more alike than i think.  when he was younger, he used to be this major chick magnet and not know it.  they girls would just wait at his house and he'd come home from helping grandma and there they'd be ... waiting for him.  and my dad wouldn't even pay attention to them.  he's walk right past them and go take his shower or eat dinner and then leave to go do more work.  my grandpa would just sit there shaking his head trying to get the girls to go home.  so my dad... was a heartbreaker and didn't even know it... or at least he was pretty modest about it.  he met my mom in 1980 and i think they had me... the mistake.   letting his more carnal urges take a hold of his better judgment... and they stuck together ever since.

this is where we differ.  i plan on finding mr. right... mr. right for me!  but everything else, i would love to be just like my dad.  what i wouldn't give to find someone just like him.  :)

i got the most random compliments this week.  i guess those are the best ones.  i told sam that i was on the market once again and he responded: good, i thought you were too pretty and too smart for him anyways.   jenny... (whoa!)... a chick ... said ""if i were sexy, i'd prob would've hooked up with a guy with a tongue ring.""  yes, i kiss and tell.  siv asked for my blessing to pursue a relationship with my long time crush, erik sandler (since we were in 4th grade).  awww i thought that was sweet of her, but that was sooo long ago.  danielle called me up and said i was gorgeous... gorgeous because noth only was i a cute looking girl but because i have ""a fanatastic personailty.""  we can't get by on looks along and that i was beautiful from the inside out.  and lastly from another girl who had a crush on someone i was dating... but wouldn't try anything because she liked ME too much.  that makes me feel pretty nice to know that people do think of me and my feelings ... and are concerned that what they do might hurt me.  that almost brings tear to my eye. :) i'm so lucky... just not so much in the dating realm, but i keep close company those who possess similar qualities.  


i don't know how people can cheat.  have they no conscience?  that alone scares me... to live life knowing you cheated.  no one would know... but you and that's all it takes.  i remember talking to danielle about infidelity and she said that it would take a lot of effort for her to do that. and to me at that point, i thought i'd be easy to... but now just the thought of cheating, immediately the image of the person that i would hurt pops into my head. so it's impossible for me.  even if you got me toasted, i wouldn't.  too many repercussions.  i'd have to lose consciousness... and at that point you're just taking advantage of me."

that's the new pick up line these days :o) you know what my line will be when I date next ... it'll be: promise you won't fall in love with me.


dear douche bag ex-boyfriend of my close friend,

i hope you know that you've probably lost the best thing that'll walk into your life.  to have dated her makes you lucky.  she doesn't just chose anyone.  to have let her go, makes you stupid.  she could possibly be one of the greatest people on earth and with time maybe you'll realize that, but by then it'll be too late.  love is blind... but you didn't love her ... yet you were blind to see what everyone sees in her.  someone who'll commit herself entirely to seeing that things work out - her greatest quality, her greatest weakness.  someone so genuine, kind, and unselfish.  someone with a big heart and who's so strong and can make anyone crack a smile.  she's beautiful and she's the entire package. 

i don't understand how you took her for granted.  i don't understand why she stayed as long as she did knowing she was unhappy.  actually, i do .  she wanted to give this relationship 100% - her best effort, against friendly advice.  she should never have to cry.  she still talks to you and you don't deserve it.  as much as it erks me, i know she'll be there for you in the future.  she's a bigger person than i will ever be, but at least i appreciate her.  she deserves so much more. 

fucking piece of shit.
XXXX XXXXXX


i think this is a letter every person needs when coming out of a relationship.  i'll need to read now and again to remember not to let any person treat me like a doormat.  i know my self-worth and i should trust my instincts.  i know that i can take into account a friend's advice, but ultimately it is my decision what i do.  my life, right?  if it doesn't feel right, bail. 

i've learned quite a bit from relationships.  I learned from jimmy that talk is cheap and actions speak louder than words.  i learned from anish that breaking up is not a solution to every argument and felt what unconditional love is like.  i learned from bobby to trust my own instincts and that i can handle quite a bit for a 23 yr old.  and anish - i can stand on my own 2 feet, don't you worry. and maybe they learend somethings too... like: don't hold back, be honest, and ... well i guess they all learned what i'm all about... or at least a little bit. 


on the brighter side of things, sushi tomorrow with blondie.  morton's steakhouse on thursday for a lab farewell dinner. and friday who knows where darragh will take me.  maybe for some irish food?

i'm so in my element these days.  ""dynamo lynh is back""  ... heh ... i treated some mice today, met with paul nghiem and his slew of post docs, talked to lauren... made some boys nervous (some dorky lab tech who froze when i introduced myself.  he didn't identify himself.  he just stared at me with this smirk)... ate lunch with jenny,  dinner with mike and jenny at chilli duck and wandered the mall.  added to my thesis and have written in my journal today.  my day is complete. 

leave a comment.... dodio :)"

"event","i'm typing my thesis and i'm about to poke my eyes out.  good new though... me and my PI will be chatting about the possibilty of me going to switzerland!  yay!

i love the summer... though its friggin hot here. 

i love friends.  i reccomend that everyone have at least a handful of them.  you have absolutely no i dea hwo lucky i am to have friends that have my back.  i would be in tears sometimes bec of a boy... i have lots of guy friends... butch ones too... and to crack a smile or to be half joking they would say... want me to break his legs... or i have friends who have guns, does that help?  :oD  haha, boys.. don't mess with me.  i'm from lynn/boston and i have the mafia connection!

so the summer. lemme just make a prediction.  more guys out in full swing. more guys who have balls to hit on girls. more guys in heat... just like any other summer.  who's to say that this hasnt started already.  a 21 yr old up and walked up to me and said i like your get up (meaning my outfit of beater and jeans).  found out he's a senior at BU, korean and portuguese... and likes his girls wild.  heh.   total frat boy with the spikey hair, cockiness, and abecrombie outfit with baseball cap.  oh yes... and i have caught site of the dirty bus driver.  i've already made plans on how to avoid bumping into him.  just once, i'd like ot go through a summer with some friendly smiles and occasional head turns.  none of this can i get your number crap.  I'M SO ASEXUAL! and you can thank someone for that. 

it's me time, remember.  med school apps, this thesis, switzerland... and let's not forget that i'll prob be in boston for just one more year... i do long term... i don't do short term.  and to start something right now only to put my head in a long distance relationship... NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR!  random hookups with no strings attached, maybe... i said maybe


ok... i think i had my break.  i will get back to thesising.

"event","lots of things have happened.  the biggest change is that i am single.  briefly i was sad, but i remembered how much fun being single would be.  i haven't been single for 6 years at least.  been focusing on one guy if not another... it's ME time.  side step it guys,  this girl may seem to have her heart blended and served in a jamba juice smoothie... but like rubber, she bounces back. 

so i'm gonna be single for a while i've decided.  i've been accused of not being able to do just that... and if you knew me well you would know that i love to prove  ppl wrong.  it's the nature of this beast.  maybe i'll develop a casual dating scheme.  multiple non-serious, non-sexual, no strings attached, non -relationships.   this is a very possible venture, with all the guys who have hit on me or are willing... haha... wouldn't mind a no strings attached relationship. this would be easy... now only if i didn't feel gross by the end of the day knowing that i've macked with multiple people in a week.  i could develop this emotional detachment and never connect with another human being again.... haha right... i'm making up stories.  but sometimes i do wonder how i may have skipped that stage of life when you just hit it and forget it. i've never had the urge to although the opportunity has presented itself multiple times. 

i can imagine all the friends that would be disappointed in me... bah... some would cheer me own

just wanted to check and say that I'M A HAPPY CAMPER once again"

"event","i went into the lab this weekend to inject melanoma cells into mice bevel side of syringe up.
i stood in line at qdoba for a burrito and noticed a lady with several shades of eyeliner striped on her left hand. 
someone set off the alarm at best buy and i think: well there's magnetism and coils at work.

i'm well aware of the details and at times i wish people understood that about me.  seriously... people will argue with me about occurence of events about what was said and not said, done or not done... and they are soo sure of themselves i just let it go, knowing full well what the truth is because i know exactly what i did and can affirm it with what i was thinking at the time.  i let it go... bec it's not even worth it to bicker about this shit. my rep, however, suffers.  i become the girl with the faulty memory.  dude... i can remember specific protocols i've done a month beforehand... i wouldn't even keep a lab book if it didnt save me time relaying information back to people and eliminate inevitable doubt.  

does this mean that i have no doubt?  no.  when i'm unsure, i express it.  and usually when i express some doubt, it's to cover my ass or to save face and not seem as cocky... to avoid developing a bad relationship.  i just hate it when i know they're wrong and they really think i'm wrong.  my primitive instinct (hahahah) is to take their head and stick it in a pile of snow.  if i were really mean, i'd say a pile of poo, but i'm not mean.

i just want someone to understand me.  someone who knows why i do things and why i don't do things.  and if not someone who's curious enough to find out.  i guess i miss that.  someone who is just as curious about life as i am and who won't make fun of me because i am ... but who'll look at me and encourage that curiousity even if it is a little childish... bec ... a person without curiousity is just... BORING.  
""when you stand next to ocean, i hope you feel small"" - i will never lose this quality - wonderment, curiousity, imagination.

i saw sam, my mentor this week... and it's *refreshing* (i use that word a lot) because he notices these qualities about me and he appreciates it.  i'm referring to the details, attentiveness, peculiarity.  sigh... isn't that what we look for in life... someone who can understand you and sees all the good in you.  

Isn't that how most affairs start?  the ones NOT solely based on carnal urges and the immediate high you get from doing the forbidden.  These are the type of affairs that make a person wish his/her spouse were more like the mister/mistress.  someone sees something in you that your spouse doesn't... something attractive, something good.  someone who appreciates the good in you.  i guess,  this maybe just be a normal product of a marriage.   good qualities become the norm, often taken for granted.  routine lives start to wear on a relationship.  encouragement and excitiment gone.  all that we appreciate about one another temporarily forgotten in a moment of weakness.  can you tell that i'm a little aprehensive... deftly scared of marriage.  it makes its a whole lot scary to me to understand it, because there's a possibility for me to forgive it... and i don't want to.  it shouldn't be forgiven.  it can be done.  i listen to relationships that survive it... and i ask myself why?  i guess for me, i wouldn't be able to forget that whoever jerkface is ... to him, someone else was better for months, for a moment... i guess i just have a lot of self-respect.  

no one has ever cheated on me as far as i know. i wouldn't care so much about a kiss, or even sex if i could beleive that it only was just that... and not a some CONNECTION he had with her that he didn't have with me. whatever. 

lol.  anyways.  it's always nice to get compliments from people.  i guess (i say that a lot too), the moral of the story is that no matter how shitty my life is that i should, we should, give thanks/ show appreciation for things esp to those we care about.  for the most part, i've been good about that. holidays... dinners... kisses... i love yous ... heartfelt emails ... cards... phone calls... genuine thanks... big bear hugs. :)"

"event","so i finished filing my taxes.  well almost.  used www.completetax.com.  i'm sure i'll hear from a particular indian child but it was free.

anyhow. i'm volunteerting at the hospital right now and i'm just thinking how ineffcient this system is.  fuctionalism theory - when one part doesn't do it's job someone else is there to step in. not the case.  this hospital doesn't network enough.  no communication amongst the health care providers or should i say clearly comprehendable communication (a grunt and a mumble here and there - unacceptable)... and then you have these yuppy physicians who have no awareness to how they may improve ""this system.""  immunizations, blood tests, screenings... it's not like these patients are chronically ill or like the results of these tests can be determined right away (except hearing and vision, which i do... but if there is a problem with either of these senses i still have to refer them to a specialist). so hours of waiting to me just doesnt make any sense.... just like waiting in the ER, THE EMERGENCY ROOM, for 3 hours before being seen doesn't make any sense to me.  granted a broken arm is not life threatening but can you imagine the swelling that can accumulate.  Once that fluid is there, it's there for a while... impeding much needed blow flow to the tissues that need to have waste flushed out, that need the nutrients and oxygen, that need to get better.  (i'd make a damn good doctor... so let me in already, imtoogoodforlynh med school... yeah, let's not digress)

maybe it's just how i work.  i always try to find the better way of doing things... being more efficient, getting more bang for your buck without sacrificing quality... for example, lab work... i can start and finish a maxi prep and a transformation, and stainings, run a gel, and passage my cells under 3 hours if i coordinate my down times appropriately.  Mike, our lab tech would take 7-9hrs easy.  i feel like people are putzing around, not thinking, wasting my time and wasting the patient's time... which of course leads to grumpy patients/parents and a pleasant patient/provider experience.  some things are just really easy to solve.  why don't people care?!  ok ... so maybe i'm a type A personality, with these high expectations of myself and of other people.  always on the move, always thinking.  sometimes i wonder how people can live the lives they have without curiousity.  why would you continue doing something the hard way/ the inefficient way/ the comparatively poorer way when there is a better way? because that's what people are used to and that's all they know.  

i've decided i will be practicing in an academic urban institution, where care is needed most and care needs improvement most, where change isnt perceived as bad.  and of course i can then go on and teach other residents.  i'm thinking preventive care... where else to stamp out disease, but before it even emerges. either that or geriatrics or special needs.... where i think most patient's needs are ignored

i swear i try not to get frustrated with the world. i can't help it.  i was even writing a happy entry the other day.  maybe it's because i'm a perfectionist... like jacob... like bobby... like many med students... things aren't good enough to us... and so happiness/satisfaction/contentment takes a litle more time to get to.  to me, there's always a better way of doing things.  self-suffient, resilient, effiecient... they are qualities i struggle when dealing with people that bring about thoughts of incompetence.  I'm sure i sound a little pompous right now... but whatever.  i live in a fast pace city.  i have little tolerance for all things slow.  i could never live in the midwest.

"event","lots of things to talk about tonight.
i went to the gym today with bobby.  bobby left early.  but at the gym a while ago, i befriended andres who happens to be an md/phd.  nice guy.  quiet.  last time we met we were talking about med school applications and the nonsense we have to go through.  i didn't realize he was an md/phd at the time but i figured ti out quickly from the way he was talking about when he applied... what schools, the school he knew he'd get into but knew he didn't want to attend, location of school, type of curriculum, happiness -subject based or systems based... factors that only very confident, very strong applicants would consider.  hints of choosey-ness, a luxury i lost somewhere in college.  anyhow.  i always see him in the gym and it's always a casual wave hello.  today we chatted for a moment and he told me that if i ever had any questions about the med school application process that i could come to him.  nice gesture.  buffered with i'm sure you could go to anyone here. modest and nice.  i said thanks and went to use the butterfly machine.  i left the gym and half way down the hall i hear ""lynh!""  it's andres.  he came to me with a yellow piece of paper with his number on it. if you have any questions feel free to call me.  ... uh, yeah ... maybe my head is a little big for my body, but i just thought is he giving me HIS number?  i see him all the time, so why would i need his number? and it's med school.  i've applied before. i just can't help thinking... is it some vibe i send off?  that i'm available.  i AM approachable and friendly.  i don't intimidate.  is that my problem?! ... pft... yeah bec i'm supposed act unavailable like a snob who happens to be externally attractive.  yeap... not really worth a journal entry, but it is something i often think.  but then i remember... guys will always be guys. 

i had dinner with jacob, sacrificing a day at church.  he is an amazing person.  we went to hs together and haven't seen each other for an enormous amount of time.  i saw him a couple times in college but then he kinda dropped off the face of the earth.  his email died... and i eventually googled him to find his new email address.  it's amazing what a girl can do when she puts her mind to it.  anyhow.  amazing person, who I, just clique with.  five years from now, i can assure you that we will rehash our lives to each other and suddenly look at each other realizing how comfortable we are.  i surely will be giggling like a school girl.  it was a good time of exchanging stories about life and relationships ang growth and appreciation of the people we have in our lives, discussing questions that we both have had, sharing experiences.  it may be just that i haven't seen him in a while, but i don't see a lot of this type of connection with other friends.  well... my  ""friends"" are of a pedigree. haha... med school student wannabees, with little experience with life, little learning outside the textbooks, no interests of their own beyond science.... BORING PEOPLE. lol. i'm actually thinking of one person in particular.  *cough, cough* phd's students aren't any better either. 

we've had similiar questions about everything and .... we... just celebrated growth.  jacob was a student teacher in history and after much agony he discovered this may not be his life's passion.  me ... he could tell science was mine.    i told him an interest in science is a required prerequiste to being my husband and i went about disections, diagnoses and cadavers and my 3rd burn on my leg. i guess  my eyes twinkled and he just knew it was my passion.  .  I can't ... i just can't see myself doing anything else.  i have this passion and an inabilty to make it happen.  i look at bobby now and i say that is me next year.  we wanna become doctors. we'd be damn good at it, fockers!  LET US IN!  i've already got patients lined up ... and we need doctors... wth! 

it's trying times for jacob too.  teaching... something i thought he would be good at bec he's the type of person who's passionate about things like that... almost obsessive.  very concerned... always looking to improve. never resting.  qualities i respect.  it's too much work for him taking on a job that's decievingly a one person job, but really requires an army to do what he wants to do.  :( so he's trying to figure things out and while he's doing that he's waiting tables.  and he gets to meet a lot different people with a lot of diffent perspectives.  coincidence that i was just thinking how fun it would be to a waitress. 

he's dating a girl named karly, an indian girl he met at swarthmore.  we exchanged stories about our relationships.  we both want mutual growth, companionship, in his words ""kindness"", someone goofy, someone who'll challenge.  we shared moments when communication wasn't an option because it was a dangerous topic... ""love"" vs. ""in love,"" the future, parents that kind of stuff that could quickly end a new relationship.  poof! gone.  break ups and broken hearts... family members with outside perspectives, leaving you with ""i like him/her"" or ""she/he was a good match for you.""  makeing the best of things and learning from our relationships.

he talked about a girl he was madly in love with and he measures up each relationship against it.  ring a bell?  hellll yeah!  first loves and gauging love ... if i had enough time to talk about that. 

i was high on life for like a week after talking to him.  i called sean and he was like ... so, you and jacob... you think you two would kindle something if he moved back to lynn... haha NO!  we're just very different people now. and i think my appeal for guys has plummeted.  dating entails work, getting to know a completely new person, adapting yourself once again... and besides i'm in a perfectly nice relationship right now."

"event","""What are you looking at? what are you, racist?""  something you often hear on a bus with a couple of bitter individuals sitting in the back.  how many of us are racist?  a good number, but not strictly againsts african americans... and i guess you really can't say it's racism if it directed towards *Americans.*  clarification, not just any american; any american who more than one generation removed from their immigrant relatives.

where is this coming from?  I'm in a inter-racial/ inter-cultural relationship. often times i do think there is a culture clash between the two of us.  and _very_ often, friends comment it is tough for two very different cultures to mesh.  what 2 cultures aren't different? and then i realized the hindi and buddist religions are very similiar, stemming from the same origins, muslims, sunni, shiites. granted they are religions, not cultures ... but still religion influences your way of living.  

i talked to sam, my mentor/post-doc who's going through a divorce right now.  he's persian, she's caucasian (a mix of italian and numerous other breeds).  he goes on about how's she is really selfish.  how she was expecting him to be rolling in dough (he's an md/phd now) and the 2 of them living in a nice house by the beach.  (he just finished his training! idiot! whatever.)  she's catholic, he's muslim. she's a college drop out, he's northwestern/harvard grad.  he came to the conclusion that the two of them were just really two different people.  many of the problems related to culture... upbringing, attitude, lifestyle.  I can relate to him because our cultures aren't that different from one another ... and maybe because we're friends.  Americans (and i agree with some of this) are egocentric, driven to attain immediate pleasure/satisfaction, me me me, how can _I_ beat the system, how can i get more $$$, let's sue... little regard to how others are thinking, feeling... no understanding.  it's just ME against the WORLD. and the attitude is that it is a dog eat dog world so fend for yourself... and and if you have a problem with something, bitch about it, bring it to a superior, i dunno... stir up some rukus.  how are we to fxn harmoniously???

none of my asian friends (the ones who aren't white-washed... white-washed, that's a horrible phrase, it's more like americanized) date outside the oriental realm.  i think siv and i are the only asians who've ventured out of the slitty eye norm...  indian friends are the same.  europeans, yup.  sam said he will only date persians, asians, or europeans... those who have cultural backgrounds outside the american one.  can you call american culture a culture?  i don't think we know what we're doing, what we really believe in, do we have a common sense of what is right and wrong, common values, morals, traditions, beliefs... we are the melting pot, a sum of many cultures... existing separately but together. yeah, i dunno.

i've heard a lot of negative american stereotypes (besides bush and his slew of idioc decisions)... like traditional vs non-traditional moms, a lot about attitude (which i sorta buy into bec the only people i see who bitch and moan are well-spoken americans with an extensive vocabulary in cussing... misery likes company and it spreads like wild fire)... the fruits and vegatables don't have the same freshness and smell. and you know what... the biggest difference between americans and other cultures is that other cultures will expect the worst and make good out of a bad situation (italians, russians, chinese, filipino, etc).  that's why you see so many immigrants working shitty jobs to put their kids through school, or to put food on the table.  they work their way out of welfare from the bottom of the bottom.  americans expect the best and if not given the best are disappointed. cue bitching and moaning. i guess that's why they're so miserable. think new york.  that's like the epitome of american.

i consider myself a mesh of american and vietnamese cultures.  the great thing is that i can live and indentify with both... be a dog in a dog eat dog world and still come home and be thankful for what i've got and not be bitter. 

i do realize that of the friends that i get along with, most are second generation whatevers: anna, chrissie, tammy, mo, mike t, mike m, hashim, anish, dariusz and darraugh, the native irish man in my life
but i do have a lot of friends who don't fall in that category: sean, bobby, ellen, greg, jimmy, tom k, tom m, robin  (i didn't think i could name that many)

i'm lynh and i'm a vietnamese american, american vietnamese."

"event","so i'm trying to figure out if i really want to do a md/phd

here are the pros and cons:
++++++++'s
-Excellent research experience. Few MDs get the type of experimental know-how that a PhD gets. 

-Strong basic science background for clinical problems. This translates into insight into difficult clinical cases. 

-A minor advantage is graduating medical school with little or no debt. It's almost an irrelevant advantage though, you'd be making real money 4 or 5 years earlier if you didn't go the combined MD/PhD route. The stipend is not reason enough to go the MD/PhD route. 


-------'s
-Time. The MD/PhD program typically takes 8 to 10 years to complete. By the time you're done with you're degrees, the people you started med school with are finishing their residency. Some may even be on the faculty of the med school. 

-You're not done. Before you can practice medicine or do research you have another 4-7 years of training. If you do a residency you'll be able to practice medicine; if you want to do research you'll have to do a fellowship. The alternative to doing a residency is to do a scientific post-doc. You'd be able to move into a faculty position sooner, but your pay would be that of a PhD, and you wouldn't be able to practice medicine. 

-You're no more competitive than a single-degree job candidate. If you're looking for a faculty position in a clinical department, an MD with a fellowship is much more appealing than an MD/PhD with just a residency. If you're looking for a position in a basic science department, your doctoral degrees matter less than the quality of your research and your recommendations. In the end, if you're good you could probably cut 4-5 years off your training and still end up in the same position. 

and the Admission Requirements 

Admission to MSTPs is competitive. It usually requires good grades (3.6 or better), high MCAT (10 or better per section), a good GRE score (1300 or better), significant research experience (publications are a big plus), and strong letters of recommendation. 

say i up my gpa, and get into a md/phd program... do i really want to wast 3-4 years of my life to come out behind financially and in practice.  ugh... but the knowledge i would gain... wouldn't i be a better doctor having all this reseach experience, being able to apply bench work to the bedside. oyyy!  a dilemma indeed."

"event","i can't complain.  things are good.  

i'm getting a hang of this growing up stuff.  life is really about compromises.  accepting things, understanding people, lot of give and take.  some things cant be changed like values and morale, the expereinces that make us who we are... our charater, our essence.

i went through a lot of my stuff last weekend, papers from HS and even jhs.  i have learned a lot and retained very little.  i also went through things that i kept bc of sentimental value.  things like notes from a former bf, flowers and carnations, cards, things given to me out of affection.  i started throwing some of it away.  i meant to keep them so that one day i could look back and remember what i did in the past, what made me happy... what was a huge deal back then.  but i kept a lot of things... jeez, i don't know what i'm talking about in these notes... and i used to find humor in everything and i was way wittier than i am now.  and the flowers and cards... i really don't evenknow what these guys were thinking. i was such a dork.  even now i don't know what people see in me that's so special. i get a lot of ""i'm really glad i met you""... or ""you're such an awesome person""  or something of the like where the other person is really saying jeez, there's something different about you and i like it.  my uncle in vn told me that i'm the type of person that a lot of people will like/love. thinking in my head, tell me about it... my ex-bf still loves me even though i treated him like crap... not the best-gf in my day.  still kicking myself.  butt is currently sore.

i dunno how i feel about keeping things from past bfs.  one side of me feels like i haven't really let go of them if i don't trash some stuff. and another part of me feels like i'm just trshing him and whatever we had together.  i still have stuff given to me as a gift from past bfs... and i can't help but feel a lil guilty.  i see these items in my room, like a shirt or a necklace, and i think of them... and then i feel like somehow i'm cheating on my current bf.  so then i don't wear these items or they collect dust, lose their style, and become outdated oneday.  say i give these things away... then i feel like i really am trying to erase them from my life... and i'm not that person at all.  this is an issue with me and pictures.  i mean, what do you do with them?  these people were important people in my life, you know.  and i don't necessarily want to forget them, but at the same time i want to feel like i've moved on. 

all this because bobby brought up his mom/sis developing pictures that had his ex in them.  he didn't want them. i don't even think he looked at them.  i have albums of ex's... albums that i probably won't show him or anyone that i date.  i just think it's interesting that i haven't had a bf that had pictures of his ex stashed somewhere and i'm not sure if i should be that way too.  i don't want to make anyone upset.

today's sermon... not so great. i couldn't relate it to life.  it was about how God forgives all sins, big and small and how He'll accept you even when you lose your way.  usually the sermon is a story of some sort with a moral... this was just straight-up you and God.

goodnight world."

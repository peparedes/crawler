"event","so its so good to have a crush again. its the chase i love. but the thing is, with this guy i dont think i can have a relationship with not just because he has a girl, but he works for my father! annnnd when do i ever have time to see him....but aww we hit off so well. awww it was like stars bursting out of the universe right into my heart <3 heheheh full of giggles and smiles. its greaaaat! abd and theres this cuties who rides the T with me on the way home from school and hes just adorable! im gonna bang him...oh yeah caits gonna make him moaaaaaaaaaaaan! lol yeeeehaaaa! 

so last week was amazing pretty much and i love boston and i love ariana and emmanuel and taylor and being able to get pot any time of the night and waking up knowing ""i am loved""-the tat that ari has on her back. its so simple but its so motivational and loving ....its perfect. I love her. And ya know what else i love, i love fruit bootin with her from boylston st. all the way down to harvard sq at 2 am when theirs no traffic and you can skate along in the middle and hear the roar of the bars bursting out onto the vacant streets. Sitting by the fountain waiting for Taylor to come pick me up and take me down and follow his good graces all across town and somehow always land somwhere along sturrow drive and lay in the green grass as the cars pass us in the front and the charles is moving rappidly behind us. Its a dream. Being high and skating is like being on E, until you feel pain from your feet hurting. 
and i just cant wait until the day comes when i can share all this with him. and i dont know who he is or if hell last very long, but hell know me somehow...soon. :) 

school is easy and i cant wait to break out and make love to Ben under the cedar tree come fall. wow yes. :) 

lol hahahahah im crazy but yall already knew that."

"event","I cant even begin to day how crazy, fucke-up, and un-fun this summer has been thus far. It all kinda tummblde down with that whole really dumb ass ghetto party then my grandmothers death, and 2 months later i finally realize it will take me a good long time to over it even a little bit. She was one of my favorite ppls i know. I would just go over her house just to hang with her and talk about music and what im new into and blah blah. She was and is the main person i look up to for insipration and knowledge esp. for the arts. I miss her so much more than i thought. 
My parents are going to Japan this October...and since i have school, I cannot go. :( Oh well my mom said she buy me a new mac and help me with some car stuff in exchange. I know she feels bad, and i knows shes been     trying extra hard lately becasue of all the things that have happened. 
Living right outside Boston has been so great! I love it here and the people are really nice. My sister i swear, shes my angel. <3 
I didnt think for a moment that i would miss my mom or my room or even that huge house thats too big for 3 people or taking rides in the porshe to the malls with my mom listening to jazz. But i do. It has taken about 2 months, but its just started to sink in. Ive been calling my mom more often, which means, ive been calling her. I think she realizes that im getting home sick. WHich is super weird for a girl who went to boarding school in middle school and also went away to summer camp for 3 months. But when your living on your own and making your own ""responsible"" decisions ....its a whole dif. ball game. And i really needed someone to talk to about my grandmother. I mean, sure, ive talked about it and all...but not as much as ive needed. 
She died right next to me. I was looking at her, thinking about what time I should get ready to leave to go back to my apt. in natick when her breath didnt come back. And my aunt and the family nurse called in cousin, the doctor in for a second opinion bf she took the time and mad the announcment. She passed quitely and soundly atn 5:27 June 22. She was so lucky she didnt die choking or awake or having a sesure. I helped her body get ready for creamation with my aunt and my female cousins by giving her a bath and dressing her in a cream dress, like my grandfather wanted. It took so much courage and idk ...just effort not to throw up. I helped the head so it wouldnt move and when we were turning her to make her bed since when you die, your insides kinda bleed out of your body..it lets go. And so the bed was soiled and blood came out of her ears and i freaked out. It smelt so bad. 
I went to the creamation with my granfather, uncles, and my aunt cathy. No one else wanted to go. Not even my dad. THat was hard, it was sad and we sat through the creamation, as it is the Japanese tradition to do so. And again, my second time doing so, this one was the hardest. She wasnt just a grandmother to me, she was also like a mother.

"event","shes making me go crazy. shes like so fuckin aaaaagh idk. 

i go food shopping and i get pastrami and she keeps saying ""ewww gross"" omg fuckin god how old r u? but then yet she pretends to be some kind of food conesure...if that so, dont make fun of ANY food..makes sense. 
then she wakes me up at the crack of dawn when im sleeping ON MY DAY OFF FROM WORK. i need to get a lock for my door. not only that she wakes up at 7am dancing around the house with the mucis on singing....fuckin christ u have no idea how much i wanna scream bloody murder. 
she leaves shit alll over the apt. never cleaning what she just left. leaving the tv on and the dinner out all night and stinks up the place. 

but if i do one thing, i get screamed at. i had my music on volume 6, and shes like IM SLEEPING! yeaaah at 3pm...u do it at 7am, but volume 30! she also has no idea what privacy means, she comes in my room at any time blaring something of no importance usually when im naked and or jsut what to be left the fuck alone. usually when the door is closed it means GO AWAY. i should get a door knob sign that says ""ASHLEY DEVINE: FUCK OFF...u come in, and ill shoot you with my hand cannon!"" 

she thinks shes like the master of the house. and she brags about how much money she makes and that i should strip with her, but i have more dignity and self respect idc how much money it makes. and im not sorry."

i am truely sorry for what i put my true friends through and i also hold much gratitude and thanks towards them for helping out with everything a good friend should do. ""a friend in need, is a friend in deed.""
and i finally got to meet Neva, chris' girlfriend from fitchburge s.c. 
I felt as though i had already met her due to chris' non-stop babbling, but sincere and cute all at once. I knew i would like her, or i should say, i knew i liked her. So that was wicked chill and shes super down to earth and respectful-just what the doctor ordered for chris. ;) im happy for ya bro ;) 

so ashley was annyoing the whole night-almost. and yes, i can say that cause she doesnt know i even haaave a lj! ahahah. sorry i luv ya babe. 
i was kida depressed about the whole kevin thing-still am. but its my own god damn fault for getting so attatched to someone whos ""an ass"" (chris) i dont think hes an ass, he means well. i just feel lost w/o him now. his personality was so wonderful. wow, im talking about him like hes motherfuckin DEAD! argh ahah. 


so yeah someone fuckin huge asshole stole 30 bucks from my wallet...nice nice very nice. loove you thank you SO much. :)....fucker

"event","so yeah last night...i cant even really say how weird it was. especially if one is not prepared for such things. My sister and I are the closest grandkids to my granparents...we spent more time with them as kids and still try to. My grandmother can cry in front of me because she knows she doesnt have much time left, she couldnt even ask my other cousin to give her a back rub. Ive never felt so hopeless in my life. 
My grandmother is the stongest woman i know, she has beaten terminal cancer once and now, 5 months later...this. Ive been trying to get to know her, trying to soak up as much information to pass down to younger generations as possible, but..it was hard to concentrate when all i as thinking about was not having her around anymore. How hard it would be and how worried of my grandfather i am. My grandfather is my favorite person in the world, i think i mentioned a whole entry just about him a couple posts back. Hell circle the world for me, hes given me so much-they both have. I look up to them so much. They have accomplished so many things in their lifes. My grandmother was a oprah singer in japan when she was young and then taught music at Burkley and BU for years and recieved many awards. She went to school while taking care of 3 boys and didnt even know english very well, and then went on to get her doctorate in the arts-music education. 
My grandfather is much of the same and he got his master in college education. he was a professor at BU for 10 years until he was granted the position of Dean and BU, SED. theyve been through so much. and i hope i can do as much as they have. 

im just sad. this whole house is one big bucket of tears. My dad looks like hes always pissed-but of course-his mom is passing away! i wish i could help, i wish i could make it all go away.

"event","so this week im going to be uber busy ...and maybe thats a good thing to get my mind of some things that have been dwelling up their for some time. 

I i have self respect, maybe hwat im doing right now, will hurt me one of these fine day...but for now im not trying to look in the future. Im trying to see in the present. and i guess, this is what i want. Welll actually, thats a slight lie. I want a relationship...but im to coward to say it or to go out and get it. and thats for many unsiad reasons i dont wish to uncover this late at night and this boozed up. Maybe i am insecure and think little of myslef, but i try to see myself in a better light-as a good person. To place myself around people who care and love me for who i am without any fancy garbage. And i think a lot of my friends do that for me. I thank you chris and ashley and Lauren and Alyssa-fuck commas-. AShely-i love her so much, she makes me feel whole again. i cant even say how much i owe gratitude towards her-i odnt even know if she knows how much i really love her. <33 Kevin kevin kevin, wow idk. Im taking a break from him for a bit for certain reasons hah.But he sees me in a diff. light thatn anyone else (not better, just different.) he sees me not in a category or a type or maybe jsut a women with breasts lol chirs will agree. 
but, hes such a dif person that i have ever met and thats what partly drives me towards him. Maybe its also cause he legally insane...ahah seriosuly. thats also drives me off the roof. lol yUP> 

hes a crazy ass kid who has much love for everyone and everything. He understands theri is grey areas i.e open minded. whenim with him, he makes me feel like im on a island vacation or out on a calm sea. LUCID. 

i just wish that i could change his ways, or change his mind about me. and thats where i have iven up and realized-im just not the girl to do it. 

i need something ive been searching for and cannot find. I know now, its not with kevin...but OHhhhh... how i wish it was. i wish for days. Id dance a thousand steps to get him back in my arms. ""i would launch a thousand ships to bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips as i burn up in your presence."" IG

"event","havent slept in a few days, and my brain turned to complete mush today while driving and just about everything. i got lost going to kevins house...helllo! i use to live right near him. But i am proud of myself for mastering backing out of his tricky driveway...i must say, hes proud of me for that. He was all like, ""Wow, look at you, Miss. Hot Shot Driver, didnt take you long to square that technique off."" and i smiled wide on the phone. 

Me and L went to his house just to drop off his chillin he left at my house, and i must say, im happy i got an excuse to see him. He wanted to follow me in...i think cause he kept walking while i was trying to hand it to him. hhaha. Timmy, his younger half bro...so nice and cute was waving hello from the deck. I talked to him a bit about last night...and i didnt want to say much (lauren, you know why) sshhhh. wink wink. ;) 
and umm he seemed concerned or nosey as to whom i was with. but it was nice. then it got to the good part but not for long cause L was in the car waiting so it woulda been not cool. So yeah and then we went to the mall. 

My grandmothers not doing so hot with her cancer.But we can only hope for the best! 


kevins been great, and i totally take back the whole ""he doesnt do shit for me."" cause, he does...and im happy that i have him...or w/e i have. Lauren, thinks he likes me and wants dif. than what he had said. I hopes so much!

"event","so yeah, im bored. but i have tond of homework to do-which blow. I have a take home test the size of texas, 3 papers, and my finals i need to study for and then, not to metion my added stress...if it causes you more stress than happiness-it prob. isnt such a good thing. as what chris said. I mean, yeah, i knew it all along. Sometimes you jsut need someone to tell you straight up. And i know what he said to be true...its just im weak..and i cant say no. I mean, if i can get sex- if it happens to present itself to me...ill go for it, even if it might cause me a broken heart or stress. Idk what it is. Its not even really sex..its the contact, connection. Im sick..haha seriously. Somethings seriously wrong with me...if i have sex just to know someone will actually touch me...i get off on knowing im wanted. But honestly, i think thats with everyone. and if not, tell me...PLEASE! 

i lost my cell and is killing me. i cant even call my best friend..Ashley. <33 love her so much. wow. 

kevin said hed call me. its 2 40 and im getting more pathetic by the minute, waiting for my phone to ring. 
If he doesnt call...im going to try not to make it a big deal.
heres some food for thought: i get attatched easily .....maybe. Or maybe its just that kevin doesnt like me as much as i him bluntly based upon what i have to offer him. And in saying that i mean, i dont have much to offer him, therefore, how can you like/fall in love w/ someone whos of no depth or meaning. Makes sense. im just reambling thoughts, doesnt mean i think its true. well.... not always. 

i hate business classes...im not even really majoring in it!!!!!!!! 

here some more food for thought: when it rains out...i dont get horny. It like, turns me off or something cuz i get depressed. thats good then, that its raining today. :) lol

im bored, want to go shopping, but i dont. Idk! 

i miss him so much right now, and the thing that kind of sucks (a lot) is that he probubly must not miss me. Cause if he did, he would have picked up his damn cell by now and apologized for not calling me twice when he said he would. 

A. either hes really forgetful 
B. he really doesnt want to talk to me 

When i talk to a guy i like, im not like how i usually am. Like, off the wall saying whatever comes to my mind. Unless i know you reletively well. Like steve, or Kevin, or Jake and yeah then theres Jay Penman <3 the love of my life. Ya know whats weird...if he asked me to marry him, i would. And that means something...deff. Hes like, my best friend and i like him a lot-always have and always will, hell just prob. never know it. Maybe someday if im like, dieing from Pancreatus cancer (which is uncureable btw)then id tell him. lol 

Ashley thinks that guys are intimadated by me, i really dont know what the hell shes talking about cause i fo sho dont think im intimadating-well, i hope. Oh god-what if i reall am! no haha naaah. 


i made more art today...photographed nature-came out well. :) then i have to go to NESOP to develop them bad ass'. 

This Sunday is Easter-im not religious so i guess, again, ill be the one going for the good eats. haha. hey, thats good enough reason for me. even if it is 2 hour drive to my cousins house in Conneticut.

"event","this week has been great. But its also been a wirlwind of mixed up emotions and events that has been hard for my mind to get use to and comprehend. 
Seeing Chris again has been great, its actually been theraputic-if u can make sense of that. And what i mean by that is, getting back to my roots-back to the days of being unresponsable and the only real thing i had to worry about was school and occasionally setting the table for dinner, and oh, trying not to get the crap kicked out of me by my older sister (who was and still is, smaller than me) But that was my life then, when i lived in Mansfield and couldnt fuckin wait to go off to college and leave that town and the bad memories behind. But now, that im gone, that i have no residence their...its like something died...and maybe im exagerrating but i dont give a fuck. I grew up their my ties and beginnings and endings of friendship are there. And now that im gone i feel so out of touch and like i left that huge part of my life behind. When i come home to Mendon-im not ""coming home"" not enough memories have been solitified yet, nor have i made enough true friends where i can confide in them on a rainy day. It just a place where i rest my head at night...my soul and heart is still in mansfield-even if i did hate it most of my life. 

anyway getting onnn...im done with kevin. he doesnt respect me enough. But maybe i dont deserve respect if im doing something like that. I was thinkining earlier that maybe this just isnt my time and im nto giong to try too hard at anything anymore. at all, with anything. if its meant to happen- it will. even if i dont beleive in fait...haha. 

im tired. bed then class early.

"event","so today rocked except for the whole arm fracture i got at the nationals..buut where not going to talk about upsetting things! argh. 

i love my job...how many ppl can actually say that. being a gradener is sick. id care what ppl say. 

my dad wants me to get a new car cuz my cars gas is too $$$ its 50 bucks to fill up on 93 gas...BLARGH is what i say. so maybe an older car will do..amybe Audi sounds good. idk yet. 

school kinda sucks right now, from all that training and compts I really couldnt spend time on homework..but now that i can...i dont want to...of course! 

I have to admit...Kevin told me not to fall in love with him. (which was an asshole thing to say_ nonetheless, i never listent o whatever ppl tell me and im liking him more and more. And i know its bad for me. Because all he wants is the causual sex thing..and sex, well yeah, its great dont get me wrong. But sex is just is quick fix and i dont want that. i want to be with someone who actually LIKES ME FOR ME and cares..someone care about me and think im great. No too hard to ask, is it? -apparently. 
But yeah,Kev said hes think im ""mad cool"" whihc i hate btw. ""MAD"" anyway yeah and that he thinks im sexy. Thats fine and dandy-but that does nothing for soul, my love. When i was talking to him briefly about my national's racing outcomes (speed, runs, finish etc..) honestly, this hurts to say this not to metion THINK it; he    didnt    even    care. and it hurt deep down inside like a growing tumer. he was too inthrawled with his damn video game than what i had to say, and say wow congrats. thats all i was looking for. W/E what do i expect from someone who told me not to fall in love with him and doesnt want o commit-and when he says commit-i instantly think he doesnt want to commit to me. this whole thing is so bad for me-its being used-but more than that-----::sigh:: guys suck....they just want to fuck your vagina and leave 10 seconds later. -WAM BAM THANK YOU M'AM.- well thats, honestly, not how i want to fly. 


help me. 


but today is sunny and now i have to get down to business with school work.

"event","I almost enjoy my father being home sometimes, when he plays the Beatles on his guitar or puts in a Miles Davis cd, it comes cascading up the back staircase and up under my door into my ears. Its security. 

The other night we had my grandparents over for dinner,i was still upstairs huddled in my conforter bussy perfecting lonliness and depression due to on-going fight with my parents about stupid responsibilities and the such. My grandfather's always the one to come and have a grandaughter to grandfather talk. And i love it, i wait in my room until he comes up...and he always comes up eventually. He use to sit at the edge of my bed..but now he says im getting too old and big to fit him. So now, he takes a seat at my drawing table chair,crosses his leg,takes off his glasses,lays his strong hands upon his knees crossed, and wobbles his right foot up and down a bit. Just the same as if he was meeting with one of his students or staff at the university. 
He asks, ""So, are you going to join us for dinner tonight, I would love to have your company."" I smile in flatter cuz everything my grandfather does for me is flattering. ""Yes, i gueess so."", I say. We talk for a few minutes about my home situation with my parents and what i should and shouldnt do. He offers to help me out with money and a job if i promise to try to get along with my parents...but i cannot take more money from him. He has given me too much. A nice car, a job as his personal assistant as a summer job- with the heighest pay, numerous sleepovers, clothes on the days i would spend over Kurts appt and had nothing clean to wear, and his compassion along with his wise friendly ears. i say, only if i can do something to help you and grammy out, ill do it. So we make the agreement and shake on it. He pulls my comforter off my huddled body and gives me his hands and gazes at me with his blue puppy dog eyes and always says,""You see, that wasnt so hard, now was it?"" And of course, i always have to say, ""Guess not."" as opposed to ""No."" just to make it a little difficult just to be difficult. 
I was thinking, well im always thinking what im going to do w/o him in my life...i need him to be here for when im wed, when i have my first and last child and when my ""husband"" and i get in a huge fight and i have nowhere to go. He is my favorite person in the world right next to Hollis and my Grammy Jean. We understand each other so well, most of the time all it takes for us to have a conversation is to look each other in the eyes, and we both know whats swimming around up there. 

Ive been kinda bored latley Curtis is away in Mississippi doing releif work, kids are back at school, and derick and Ash work full-time. But yeah everything alright....

"event","im in love with a guy i barley know...and i dont care what anyone else thinks cuz i love the feeling of lust, happiness, and being cared for by the one i love.  
I remember everything about him, the way he moves, the length of his steps, and his deep breaths in and out when his face is nuzzled in my neck while he sit calmly next to me, waiting for it to be passed around. He said i smelt like vanilla and flowers that night. And accidently stole his button down collard shirt and sleep with it religiously. His sent is branded on his color, sleeves, and chest. He seduced me that night when i took total responsibility for me, it made me want to go ""awwww"" in a sigh of relief and fall alseep in his arms that had been holding me tight. Matt told me he had been taking care of me the whole night and stayed by my side to make sure i didnt have any more weird hullicinations and such. 
This may sound weird or trite, but i feel something with him i have never felt before with anyone else...its something uncanny-unrecognizable. Beautiful. security perhaps but thats just a tiny part. I feel as though he will take care of me, he will have the meens to and the knowledgeh. Im seeing him soon, but not soon enough. Love happens when you least expect it, and with him-its like swimming in a sea of pastries...ahaha. he puts the best feeling of butterflys in me that i could ever possibly imagine. and i dont even really know him. yeah...i know...its not realistic. but i do not care!!!!!!!!! yeah sure, maybe i will get hurt in the end..but thats called living and learning and you must love that to truely live.

"event","im feeling really left out right now-ignored. and ya know what, at first, i actually gave fuck. but now, i have come to realize, its    just   not   worth   it. i thought i was someone...(im not going to finish that sentence cuz... uggh..and i i like leaving unfinished sentences..i personally think its intreaging..u may think its annoying but then, dont read it. :p 
anyway, back to where i started, i think i might not be what i think or thought i was. I think i protray and dif. person that how i see myself. and honestly thats not good. i only have come up with the conclusion due to the a few ppl around me. I never meant to be the one who got kicked out-and by ""kicked out"" i dont mean literally. what did i ever do to deserve this lack of respect?? im always the one whos keeping tabs and hosting everything...beacuse i like to. i like hanging out with anyone and everyone. if u fly with me, i fly with you. i never go out of my way to be bitch or offend someone. however, the more i think about that, the more i think i just might. due to my personaliy. i say what i want when i want to-with reason. but if you dont know me, (which most dont at all) it could offend you. But i the majority of ppl i hang out with are guys-they say offensive things all the time. but i guess, thats not the point im trying to make. ive always had this ""charm"" of never really knowing what to say at the right time. i think thats where my candidness come in. i cant help but to say what im thinking...im honest and im very communicative. i like to tell people what im thinking or where they stand with me. In most cases, if i like you...ill straight up tell you. if i dont, i just wont talk to you. idk who i am anymore. atleast, not at this moment, maybe itll all come back to me when i awake tomorrow. but im feeling slighted because of these select few people. id ask them straight up whats going on with them and where i stand -but i know, theyd just lie straight to my face. and that would make me royaly pissed. i dont tollerate liers-esp if i ASK you. 
i honestly think part of this earths problems id because ppl dont communicate well enough-at all.
EX: boyfriends and g/f's-if a guys doesnt like u anymore...he most likely dones tell u straight up...if he doesn he calls u, e mails, IM's, sticky post's it, or makes a msgr do it. and he usually just doesnt at all periode and leave u dang ling on a thread for weeks until u physically pound it out of him-cuz guys are pussy holes. yeah breaking up is hard, but its even worse when u leave ur partner hanging on forever.

"event","this week has been tough, things i have been doing and places ive been have been a summary of high school drama-who needs that shit. 
ive been seeing ross in prov. a lot, i made the decision to fully trust him and now, im so sick and cross at myself for making a fast decision that should have been long. not just that tho, hes making me think twice. hes going to call me tomorrow and im going to bring up my point that i want to make and see what he says. is he trying to make me take back what i said?! i wish he would just say what hes feeling more, maybe that would help. 
The other night when i was sleeping over at his house, i couldnt fuckin sleep, i was cold, sad and alone. He fell asleep on me 5 min after and i wanted to cry...dont ask but thats what i felt. I started to read one of his book, then asked myself wtf am i doing, its 3am...shut the god damn book and sleep. I wanted to wake him up to be with me,but i knew he had a business meeting in the am. I decided to just smoke and that would get me to sleep....the night was so long and lonley...its was horrible. i missed him so much and then i didnt even get to spend any time with him. He left that morning at 6 30...kissed me goodbye and i didnt see him until 12 noon then he dissapointed me with more bad news. Our day to spend with each other would be fucked, due to his pick up. i wanted to fuckin ...idk be mad. So i was mad and i screamed in my car on my way home listening to RAGE. and i havent seen him since....and it sucks. 

im thinking about getting an apt. with ross, or just more in with derick and Ash...idk yet. i have no money...im always broke....idk where it goes. i jsut need to get out of this god damn awful town with these weird ppl who never hang out with the opposite sex. too many ppl still stuck in high school, which is fine...just dont get me involved in your pettiness, lies, backstabbing, and flat out lamenessssss. im over it, actually that doesnt make sence..i was never into it... get me? 

i went out with the two bestest careing ppl in the world (besides jay and dee)The night ended well, but that start of it...well, i thought i was gonna bust someomes lip. 
ashley  is deeply depressed due to her meds...derick literally gets abused..not good i dont tollerate it. i sat down with ash who i love more than anything and told her straight up my side of the story from both of their sides. I tell everyone how it is wheather its nice or not. Im a frank person when i feel like being a bit on the cruel side. she was laughing at first and by the end of my rant..she was wimpering. I didnt do it intentionaly...im sit downs are never light and fluffy with hugs and ice cream. i get the tougness from my father-(an army brat.) so in conclusion, shes changing meds and picking her shattered life back together...and i said id help..because i love her and i want to. poor derick, he take so much and hes hanging on by a thread...he calls me all the time with suggustions, but the best solution is a just once on one girl talk and a cup of soup. we saw the movie, dave chappell..not what i expected but great nonetheless. it had the roots in it, which was sick..i love them. 

i need to pace myself...with people and places and even esp. the thing i take. im trying to take care of too many people...my dying grandmother and my depressed grandfather who is my fav. person in the world. it sadens me...everyone around me is sick. even ross, but that he could let go of, if he wanted to-whihc he doesnt. 

my training sucks...cuz im too stressed and overwhelmed with my sit. with ross, grandparents, ashely, problems at home, and my sucksy ass job and maybe school. i got cut last night to be in the 3rd heat of the nationals-which im very proud of. my couch keeps telling me i need to step it up. i need to stop smoking and go to the gym more. im getting weak. i fractured my right arm, but it doesnt hurt. i burned out badley going down the second turn and i sped up too fast when i should have been slowing to go over the pole. and i cut in too much too fast and lost it..it was embarrasing cuz it was a stupid intermediate mistake and im suppose to be not....intermediate. i got yelled at whiiiile going to the nurses station...thanks thanks a lot. i need a new helmet for the races..but i cannot afford a new one. i aslo need more wax, .......more.....of more. maybe im just tired and cranky. this is really long. ..... .... .. ....


and i dont see why, or understand the need for people to say one thing and totally do another. and just bs in general, maybe thats why i dont talk to anyone anymore tha i use to. cuz everyone...is too closed...and i mean that. its hard to make friends now a days...there too wrapped up with there life and the ppl who they know to even care about you or to call you once in a while jsut to say. ""hi, how are you"" 


pleasantries is no longer an action, it is just a word.

I think i might be going over to Chelsea wed night for my sister to revise my app for framingham-and have this gut feeling that i wont be accepted...the major for art is the only one offered at a state school. Ashely keeps telling that ill get in just soley based upon my grades at BU and that im intelligent...Ash my love, they look at a whole lot more than that, and my last report card SUCKED ASSSS!!!! anyway i degress.... 

I look like total sit today i have no pigment at all. im like...WHITE as a ghost. But then,i think about how i live my life day to day and i really shouldnt be surprised. ahah. This take me back to high school when i would drink every night and pretty soon i think i had a slight case of alcholism, ok yeah, w/e so i know. High school was tough for more reasons than the whole ""intellectual and brain work"" we all know high school has nothing to do with intelligence just about how hard u put in the god damn effort. For some kids, high school is AWESOME. i really would know what the fuck they were talking about unless in involved binge drinking and getting high before class with the usual art trekies...ahahah Fran, Fran, Fran always high or strung out on E. I miss that gal. Jared sitting in the corner by himself or with sarah diligently sketching. But im glad im outta jail, and into a bigger one. lol.

My body is kinda fucked up right now, i think im getting myslef into bad habbits. But when this happens, i really cant stop it, cuz i wont. 

This kid came up to me after class in the parking lot and he bluntly said something along this,""I couldnt believe you said that to professor Frizzell so frankly, ummmm serisouly i would ever expect a girl like you to say something like that."" i didnt know what to say, so i smiled (i bet it was more of a scowel) and walked away to safety. lol. 
I dont know what he meent. A girl like me. Thanks asshole, what does that mean? i look angelic like a fuckin angle. You would be even more surprised with who i am and what im really like if u met my stupid family. Im not some cookie cutter girl-i do not sumice to any steriotypical portrate of a ""girl"" or what a girl should be. I do what i want in most cases and if u dont like it, FUCK OFF. life too short to concider your options and worry about others thoughts and crits. I continue to be free and live how i was not taught to act. hahaha. just in spite of my parents sending me to that dumb little school. (kinda)

"event","Friday i went out for my friend Brendan Malloys 20th birthday in Providence, RI and it was AWESOME. i got drunk at fire and ice haha and we walked around the state building for a few really cold but i couldnt really  feel it. I love my true friends they are such an amazing group of friends that i wouldnt trade in for the world. And i hope they all know that. I met two new ppl, too Meg and Patrick theyre a couple. <3. i gave them and Fino a ride to providence since i offered to drive. It was so nice to see everybody again from Ericas christmas party and just show that i havent been able to go to as of latley. The pictures of everyone on the state building and on the Providence Place steps came out nice. awwwwww....everyone was so elated. THe ones taken on the state building steps came out funny as hell. Theyre going to be Speacial Fredd pictures...of all  of their friends and stuff. I was so drunk i could barley walk up the damn steps. Then Goguen drove home, cuz he offered and it was all good. Everyone had to take piece of gum just in case we got pulled over, but he went the speed limit. So all was good on 146 South bound for Mass. ha. I got my new Kate Spade sunglasses and theyre wicked hott and fit me well, but im only gonna prob. wear em for speacil occasions and save my Olver Peoples and Okley's for daily wear. I went shopping again the other day and bought tons fo crap i didnt need. I went to this shop on State st. and it has tons of great crap!!!! spent 150 on pants....yeah. bummmmmer.. I miss eric...when i just typed ""bummmmerrr"" thats what he says. :(. hes up in Maine at school and im not even gonna see him over spring break. o well. 
gonna so go everywhere during break and get really drunk...all of the time. haha. gonna take a road trip to NYC....yeaaaah.
Last couple of days have been great, actually. got outta work at 9 30 then went over brens house to hang out with friends and that was cool. I had missed hanging out with all of them. going to providence with Lauren Barr which will be so fun, shes probubly the only mature 17 year old i know whos in high school. Shes not so conceited and greedy like others i know. But shes wicked cool shit and i dont hang with mnay high schoolers cuz they all kinda....are lame. idk im too old to hang with em, so i realized. 
and now i have to het back to homework and thinking about jay. <333 
i love my life, sometimes. hahahha 

thinking about going over dec. house and getting totally wicked wasted.  cuz its fun.

"event","things have been OK good this month so far. I miss my old life, the one where i knew what i was doing and going in life. Maybe i never had it to begin with, but id like to think i did. 
Classes here at the school im going to now ...are ok. im not use to going to brockton everyday. I miss Jay a lot. I miss a lot of people. I never really see anyone anymore. Maybe its best that way. Some of my ""friends"" that i thought i had are seeming to fad out of focus....and im letting them-for reason that i think are liable enough in the sense of what friendship is supose to mean...but they have no real grasp of...so it seems. I feel disconnected from everything-does that makes sence? No. yeah thats kinda what i thought. 

Ive been hanging with ash and deick a lot cuz they treat me with respect as friends should and were all best friends and thats the best. I dont feel stupid around them or out- of-place, im just me and thats cool with them. 

Im loosing weight again...and honestly i thin somethings wrong with my body and this whole training thing is wearing on me. School, work, skiing, and somewhere between it all-a life. 

My life with guys-well ill say it simply, there is none. Guys kinda suck...so dont gils. OK so the truth, you want me to say it so I can admit the fact that i just dont like people in general and im a bitch...and ppl dont like me. I try, I do..honest!I try to be nice..i AM nice for christ sake. But i was going to go with the whole ""friends"" quote but im not. For friends are not what they use to be. i would cut and past the definition of a friend..but im not that anal or ....lame as i say it. 

I see myslef as someone who you can call on to come pick u up if u have a flat, or to console in after a long hard fucked up day, someone who will buy you coffee just because. But i like doing these things for my friends. And youre going to ask, why dont you do them anymore? 
Ill say this bluntly....people just dont appreciate JACK SHIT anymore.
Theyre all WAY too self-involved or maybe just plane werent taught manors in the respect catagory. I really cant say in general. But yeah, people are too into ""ME"". This generation should so be called, The ME Generation"" Maybe im just more mature, but i know that thats not it. How many times a day or minute do you ACTUALLY think about another person whom u are with? In a social situation such as, youre own house.>Do you make them feel at home but asking them if theyd like any drink? Friends are company-good company. People dont genuenly ask ppl ""how they are"", they dont care. I support my friends with theyre things wheather it might be shows, sports, or school in general. Im there for them not only because im believe in who they are and what they do, but because i think they would do the same for me. I enjoy going to shows for my friends and cheering them on at ski comps. etc. but does anyone fuckin ever come to mine? NO. of course not. Everyones totally forgot about cait. I wish i lived someplace where i could have friends-real frinds.
its like, as of recent, why do i bother with any of it..no one really gives a shit if im there or not. Im a fly on the wall. And thats how i feel. Insignificant-unwanted. left out. 

My day today sucked but w/e. I have a headache and im moody cuz im a girl and ya know. 


Im not going out of my way for anyone until they show me respect. And in that case, ill prob. have to get new friends. 

im sad so im going to bed.

Tues. 
Ericas X mass party!!!!!! drove over to Kurts house and went out with him for a date to ericas. awww how sweet. 3"" heels are a killer! the first 3 hours i was good and still socialable. then the 4th and 5th hour i was totally UNsocaible due to the massive amount of boooozzz i had. champagne is a crime...it shouuuld be anyway. 
Jay penman cam over to me when i was passed out on ericas bed and stroked my head and talked to me. i dont remember what it was about-cuz i was half dead, but it sounded nice and my friends from h. school always give me security and a feeling of being loved.also, dee took great care of me and i love her sooo much for doing so.wow shes amazing. hanging out with friends that night was so wonderful and i had this great scense of ""contentment"" it was like being high but almost better cuz it was all me and the moment, and the amazing ppl who i grew up with who helped make that moment. wow that was corny..but i dont care cuz it was true. 
 
Wed. 
went to awesome FREE show in Ashland. it was great. i saw Lauren and we ran across the lot into each others arms. when special fredd was on me, Frank, and L. took pics. i really got to bond with everyone-dispite my throbing hang over. i had such a great time. then went over to brens to review the night and the awesome fighht at a-even tho it really did suck cuz u just dont break out into a fight at a free show with young kids around. DUH. FUCKTAR deserved to get glass in his eye. grrrr.

i slept for like 2 hours. washed up really quick went out to breakfast and had another bowl with the guys and then realized wow its 1pm....i should really get going now. hahah. pot can make you do things, actually hhahah its the complete opposite. so i finally left and went to my granmothers house...and i cant believe i made it there alive.and it was really hard to act normal. and i want to laugh really hard and i couldnt...it sucked. but it was kinda my b day celeb. so yay. wow totally unexpected. if i had know...i wouldnt have come high and with gross clothes on. wow. STONER. no no. then i went home and bren came over and i smoked again, but only cuz he made me. pffhhh. yay this week was great.

I have class in 1 hour....yippee! so anywayomg i hope its what i think it is. Cuz i mean, i really want it to be true. I need this and want it. It all felt so good, like coming home on christmas...but better like hmmm. coming home on christman, your b day, and getting a fuckin Ferrari and your fav. meal and everybody u know loves you. -something to that extent. but it all went ""as planned"" and when i say that i mean, ""as i wanted it to go."" and maaan, did i want it to go bad. more so, come bad. no,m not cum...COME. im only emphasizing that for my own dirty mind. 
I went to fsc and i dont know if ill get it cuz its a hard program to get into, and uggh idk. i dont wanna talk about it anymore. 
Ive been trying to spend a lot of time with my grandmother atleast 2-4 times a week, i know she needs it and it will  be for the best for both of us. And being with her gives me that time to get to know her, even more. and today i found out some family info. that i had never know before. just simple things that come out of everyday converstations is what im looking for. a stronger bond. and i think everything will b alright.- i hope. 

im going to go now. latersss"

My mom i think is going thru menapause or maybe shes just ....idk. 
Im seeing Bren tonight...were having a huge camp fire in his yard with some friends smokin it up a bit and relaxin. YUP-the life.

U may think i have plenty of time, but between work, other finals annd normal work load of hw -NO! So right now, i feel extremely fucked. I have to take some work off just to make ends meet. Work is great tho, it really is. Its easy for the most part and hey, i get to work with clothes! OMG my pay check is totally going to BCBG! Well, half anyway. lol. I looove the clothes and for 75% off-who wouldnt. 
I saw Eric Fri. and Sat. OMG it was the greatest! I love that hippy loving pot smokerrrrr of a guy. We went over to Jordans house in the field the night i came home at 4 am. Jordans the man. He secretly has a crush on me which is so cute cuz hes like so young. I think of him as my little bro. And he get mad cuz he thinks he ""old"" He also likes to tickle me..a lot. Eric and jordan while nick was on the sex pillow or w/e he called it. Jordan made me waffles with peanut butter-so good. But waffles with ice cream is so much better. WE watched this horrible horror flick with tits and all. It was great esp. when Jordans father walked in at 2 am wondering what the hell we were watching. lol. erics gf is nice. that all i can say. lol. Eric payed more attn. to me than her, but im hs fav. so that prob. how its always going to be. hehe. HA HA other gfs's. im a bitch. oh well. haha. Im so glad i got to spend time with him tho. But obviously he woudnt leave to go back to Maine without seein his cait. <33. 
I ended up going to Legeuls anyway cuz freddie presuaded my rents. We also got a free meal and it was AWESOME. I had coconut shrimp and mashed potatoes and for dessert we had two pumpkin cheese cakes and i had a double espresso omg soooo fuckin good. we also got to skip the line, a two hour wate haha suckasss. the hostess boy hit on my -in front of my rents which was embarrasing. And my mom said, ""if jared was here, then he would be a little jelouse."" mom shut up! Jared and i arent a couple, buuut that doesnt meaaaan i dont like him. ha. The night i had my party is something to think about with him. Idk what was going through his head or what isss going thru his head currently about the sit. Its hard to read him...hes very somber, buut that what i love about my jared. Im having a hard time choosing between chris and jared...but if i had to...idk who id choose. 
Asley hasnt called me in a week-so unsual. she usually calls me by now to tell me about wonderful derek and asking for advice-cuz ya know. im just so old and wise. but i love her, shes awesome and we han out like...a lot. expt. for this past week. ive been busy. 
I really want to go into boston to see the malson grand movie with Jordon cuz he loves skiing just as much as i do...and maybe eric too when he comes back for winter break. yay cant wait. OMG when i hugged him good bye i wouldnt let go, im like, ""im never gonna see you again.NO, dont leave"" But hes like youll see my ass in two weeks so. I let go and realized. He gave me more hugs and kisses than his gf. Which later than night i felt bad about. And some lady just said that somebody ""stole"" her driveway. lol. idk.

I hung out after 12 WOW big fuckin harry deal! I came home at 4 am ii had to work at 7 am the next day until 2pm. I knew that id b tired and what not. I knew i had to wake up around 2 hours later in time to get to work. Im not dumb. My dad got pissed when i came home at 4 am yelling at me about some stupid 'cleaning the house with us, and cleaning your bathroom.""OK yes, sure ill do it. But you told me whiiiile i was walking out the door to my double day of work. What the fuck am i gonna do about it then. Im a busy person. he was upset at the fact that I went out after 12 30, after i got out of work, instead of cleaning the bathroom and shit. I mean, what am i gonna do come home at 1 am and start clenaing????!! Then would smack me up side the head for stupitidy. I dont see the big deal. Im a good kid, yeah so  what if i drink underage (they know that) so what if i smake pot once in a while-i fuckin deserve it!!! I go to a good schol, i get good grades, i got good grades in hs (duh) and i work whiiile going full time to school. Most parents would LOVE a chile like me. NOPE, not my parents no matter what i do, its never enough or good enough. I just feel sick. Im ver worked, over tired, over stressed, and over booked with SHIT. I have finals due this friday. IM FUCKED! i had like a mental breakdown while driving home today and i almost pulled over. Im stressed. i manage to do a good job at keeping it in under pressure....but if you really know me, you'll know somethings wrong. 
Also, my rents are still pissed at me they wont let me come to dinner with Sae at Leaguls w/e FUCK YOU TOO.! <3 ------<<<<<<<<<<<

We said grace and it was a nice poem, then we toasted with champaign with raspeberries on the bottom that were 2 shots within its self. I wanted to chill with bren and jared but. maybe tomorrow. i hung out with steve, that was good. We watched cellular and talked about stuff. I was actually really tired when i drove home which is weird cuz usually i dont get tired when driving home. But i had to close my eyes at the stop light.

I need to see J. i work at 3-10 30ish then tom. 7-1.  i have tons of hw to do and i have to say, i am behind. so sunday is totally devoted to art hw, marketing, and my english report. all finals. whihc sucks. i so dont wanna do it. but the more i say that, the harder it is. so im not goin to think about it.

They dont hang out with that crowd and they sure as hell has not known them for as long as i have. Not to mention, thay are MY friends. That person has only hung around a couple times with them...and they think they know all about them. I dont know, people just piss me off cuz they are DUMB as FUCK. 
And that person seriously doesnt want my friend to like me, as more of a friend so shes being ""retarded"" about the whole thing. 

yeah so last night, it was good. I hung out with Justin and Bren- got really high on taco night and it was fun hangin with the guys. i drove home as high as a kite-which is down the street so it was fine. i came home and instantly had to eat something-duh. this weekend im excited for and i hope ill be able to hang with some ppl.

"event","yeah so ive been super busy with work and school. Its good i guess, too keep busy. But their is good and band with all things. My rents are away again in MN. I feel weird 'feeling"" this cuz honestly ive never felt this in the past 7 years. but i must say, i kinda miss my mom. Maybe its cuz im going thru a hard time in my life right now, and she there for moral support. Even if she doesnt know it. Sometimes i just wanna be around her and hang out-a lot more than i can ever remember. Im maturing and becoming an adult-which i why i think i can stand my mother a little more than usual. lol. She doesnt know how much i appreciate her and i wouldnt tell her, id be like embarressed or something weird.

But i have a job at BCBG Max Azaria, later on i hope to get an intership in cali to work for Max. thaaat would b awesome! but yeah i get commision on top of 8.50 soo like yay! i made 300 bucks more with my pay check so like 600 bucks in total. yess i neeeeed it! 

i decied to fuck english all together. and im debating on weather that is a good idea or not. I mean, my rents will have to end up seeing my report  card and shit and be upset that i failed it. but the proff. is a fuckin tard. Ive never gotten a 68 on anything! esp. english. i took the damn class just to make it full time. cuz i already took the req. english class for the year. But i love(d) enlgish so i said, what they heck...take another english. and now im getting fucked for it. Im not going to go to class anymore, do papers, essays, crits..nothiing! i just dont know how im going to do it w/o my rents knowing. 
so yeah my party tonight (since it is 1 17 am0 is going to be fun. i need fun, friends, drinks, and laughter. this is going to be good for me. and im excited to mesh my friends together. i still dotn know if jays going to come, i want him to, but what ya gonna do. right?

"event","Yeah so these past couple of days have been really hard. My car is totally fucking me up the ass and my dad said that this is the last time he bales me out....actually, i wouldnt really call it baleing me out, but w/e. Hes getting me a pos car....im guessing. He says theres no worth in getting me a new car when i really shouldnt b driving anyway. uggh fuck you...its ur fault i have add and cant concentrate on driving and that my meds make me even more depressed,therefore, i get into minor accidents. My first car i had i had for like a month...it was nice, however i use to be a spoild little ungratefuly bitch so i thought it was a piece of crap just cuz it was used and i didnt like the color. wow was i vaine. Anyway it was my dads old mercedes SUV. it had it good times and bad but over all it was a good car. And i fucked it up...of course, it was my first car. anyway i dont want to talk about that anymore. I currently have a Honda accord its a 96..leather...electric shit..its nice-actually. I should have taken more care of it-somehow. Now-its completley worthless. The exhaust system is totally ruseted-not my fault. It coast to repair: A LOT-$1500. i dont have that. and if i get it fixed it wouldnt b worth it, the car is only worth $1500-if that. so u see my point. and my delema. Cars= problemos...BIG unless you like rich and can afford it. and im not. so yeah. 
My dad is pissed at me, but honestly when isnt he? Im always fucking something up and mispleasing them. Im sorry i graduated with a GPA of 3.4 and that i try really hard to be a good kid, im dont do heroin, im sotn work on the st. corner ...yet. haha and that ive never been in jail and overall im not bad. But in there eyes im far from perfect and their expectaionts are forever climbing while im lagging to catch up. this is a never ending battle-my sister even said. But after what ive been through in the past 2-3 years i just cant afford to care anymore- i just have given up for the most part. What is the point when ur totally unhappy and your life sucks. 


My fav. cat Jasmine passed away Oct. 03 it still hurts
My uncle who turned out to be gay passes away from AIDS-who would have thought.
My grandmother was dignosed with cancer for the 2nd time
My sister was in the hospital for some rare thing...she was really ill
We move June 03...stessful
haveing to commute 1/2 hour to school everyday and being late....ugh stressful
My aunt and uncle both pass away one after the other who i loved very much
My aunt Lisa from the same family as my late uncle with AIDs passes away from a long term alcohol addiction of 10 years...she was found in her bathroom beleding out of all her aordas. ewww. 
Then my life get worse cuz im off both meds and my cars suck, school, parents, money, tuition for school. Im cut off from my parents. 
My father exteneds my rust fund to 21 not 18. So i cant get any money till then. He also took some out to pay for that ""minor"" accident that i got sued (sp) for. maybe that why my parents hate me. idk.haha



this semester im afraid that my grades are going to be that great. Ive been under a lot of stress and i havent been on my meds which helo me a great deal with school. So im probubly only gonna get a 3.0 and my parents are gonna be pissed. But if i havent managed to break yet, thats practically a miracal.

so yeah that about it. dont u wish u had my life???

"event","so ive kinda been down in the dumps lately and idk know why, ok so maybe i could take a pretty good guess, but im not going to. 

Ive been staying home when i can. with the exceptions of Court and thanks to the worries of Zackary Phillips. Who i give much thanks to for getting coffee with me in Douglas and talking with me trying to keep warm in his old red volvo. 

I saw this girl on TV, she was like, commenting on a show or something...she waS gorgeous i mean, WOW bomb shell. and for a slight self-conscious moment i had wished i looked liked her. But i know that that is low or stupid to think. I should be happy with who i am, usually i am. But not this week....and stuff. 

i need someone in my life, and by that i mean a guy. I dont even want a guy like a bf but someone to aleast take notice or find me somewhat pleasing. ughh i just feel so gone. Im not the type of girl to go galivanting all around town and back with the every cute guy i see, im just not like that i.e im not a slut. lol Im certious and conservative with my emotions and behaviours. For many of the same reasons as why to others can b the same way, - I have had my heart broken and i dont have the highest of confidence when it come to looks. But when it come to other things, im very grouunded and whole in what i beleive in. Opinionated, yes; but reasonably open to others. 

I was talking to my friend Alyssa today in the library and she mentioned how she cried last night a lot. Im like hey, me too! and it was funny cuz shes all like, OK about it. As if its no big thing. whihc most of the time it isnt. ""were girls, were emtional and sometimes depressed over the littelest things"" lyssa which is so true. I just needed someone else to point that out. But im really glad i met her cuz she so sweet and nice, but shes also really cool to be around. She makes me laugh whihc is good. Cuz usually im the one making the other person laugh. So its a good switch up. However, i dont really think im funny haha so that the weird part of it all. But ahhh oh wells. 

Im going shopping with  my mom and wed. and im really excited...like a girl. thats one thing to look foreward to this week. Thats the key to not wanting to kill yourself over loads of hw and CRAP....look foreward to something....anything. making something to look foreward to. And before you know it, the week is over.

"event","im sitting at home tonight, alone. My rents are out at least. Theyre always out. My dads getting a new car soon...he has some figures and brands written down but i dont know what any of them actually arrreee. 

I went and saw my cousin today at her college, BC. I missed her so much since the summer down at the beach house. It wicked weird how we look so alike...she just had a skinnier nose and smaller eyes but all in all u cant really tell. She just got her fathers old Beemer, cherry red deluxe series two door sports car. they only made 200. The cost was something crazy at the time, like, 75,000 in 1987. So its in great shape so if she were to sell it for some crazy reason, it would b like 100 grand...prob.? But yeah shes doing well, we went to go eat at the rainforest cafe which i love like woaaahh. he new apt. is so sick...its sickening. But yeah we kicked it off well and we played pool down on Landsdown st. and i won...even tho i dont know how to really play. I had forgotten all the great times we had shared and how much we have in common. Im so lucky to have her a cousin cuz i know she'd do anythig for me and she backs me up when no ones else does-esp. with family convos. haha. We remonised about our Europe Trip in 2000 and how much fun we had and how fuckin shit faced we got on free table wine...and stripping on balconys in our hotel room. WOW def. drunk. Our really cute flight att. on Swiss Air on our way back home....wow he was HOT...and gay but what the hey hha."

"event","shes so damn selfish i cant stand it. everything is about her in some sort of estranged way. God help me. so in 3 weeks im going to be flying off to MN cuz well actually, i really dont even know why besides to see my aunt..but i saw her over the summer so idk. My mom and dad want me to go with them. First class babay. buut its only a 90 min. flight so who cares. MN i kinda boring....theyre are a lot of wicked cool art galleries but ive been to all of them 3X. idk i guess ill go to the malls and maybe go to a few shows. my cousin jay is still in japan so hanging with him is not an option-i miss the shit outta him, hes so cool and im glad we are as close as we are; even if we are 7 yrs. apart. This christmas my parents want to go to venice, after i told them how wonderful it was....they kinda got pissed at the fact that i had gone bf them hahah suckas. But im going to the MFA to see the Ansel Adams exhibit who is one of my all time fav. artist. YAY. shits i have to get goign on my hw...i have tons of crap that i havent started due to Evans cummins ovas.haha. but yeah i havent even started on my color and design project-but its fairly easy so what the hey. ::shrugs:: 
today is beautiful out and i am way sooo pumped cuz of it!!! I want a 330ci wicked fuckin baaaad. and im not gonna get it, what a shame. My parents dont think im responsible enough to get a beamer-which is true but who cares. Im having a huge ass delema about my major. I dont know if i should study marketing or fashion merchandising. My thing is, i want to still do something that is close to my heart, close to my roots-ART. but i guess in order to be in marketing you need to be creative but not in the sense of full blown art. But i dont know what the fuck i wanna do yet. And this is bad cuz it really depends upong which school i will be applying to. Business or art or a partial mixed school. IDK AHHHHHH. im having the same delema as erica. Erica i need ur help.

The AP  and UPI reported that the French Government announced after 
the London  bombings that it has raised its terror alert level from 
Run  to Hide. The only two higher levels in France are Surrender and
Collaborate. The rise in the alert level was precipitated by a recent
fire which destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively  
disabling their military.

(AP), Paris, March 5, 2003

The French Government  announced today that it is imposing a ban on 
the use of fireworks at  Euro Disney.
The decision comes the day after a nightly  fireworks display at the 
park, located just 30 miles outside  of Paris, caused the soldiers at
a nearby French Army garrison  to surrender to a group of Czech  
tourists."

Volescu laughed. &quot;You live by murder. How many people have you both killed? And if we add in all the Buggers you slaughtered out in space...&quot;

"event","&nbsp;i'm in SF and i'm sick and bored...stuck at home coz if i went out today, i'd pay for it tomorrow...went to this party called Hard French yesterday and it was awesome, but yeah, i was coughing like hell after and BAM, i'm sick! my aunt and my cousins are in Monterey, they'll be back 10PM pa and i really wanted to go because today was the only time i'd get to spend with them...ugh, i hate being sick...it's getting in the way of a lot of things...but i haven't been getting enough sleep so it was bound to happen, i guess...i wish i was able to prevent it though...like i wish i drank lots of vitamins and shit...bahala na! i'm so bored! i'm reading but my eyes kinda hurt after a while....but i'm guessing i'll be able to finish this book and start a new one tonight (hopefully)...i'm alone with a furry, white dog i don't even like, but oh well, i was the one who decided to stay home...they were convincing me to join them...but i know the limits of my body and today would have given me a flu so yeah...

i haven't really been staying still...left for europe end of march, got back late april, left bora after a week, and left for SF 3 days after arriving from bora...maybe that's why...my dad wants me to move here but i'm not too sure...i'm not sure about ANYTHING....i'm kind of a mess but i guess it's okay...i don't care so much anymore...but i still get guilt trips...like i was thinking of extending and going on a road trip to LA but i know that i've been on vacation for too long...i feel like my life isn't getting started...like it's on some sort of stand still...and i guess that's what really bothers me about it...i've been traveling for a year and i'm putting everything (and i mean EVERYTHING) off...

i'm no longer bitter about a lot of things...that's how this whole &quot;escapism&quot; thing began anyway...i was bitter, i was broken and i needed to get away coz i didn't have the strength to face whatever shit it was i had to face...now i'm fine and i have whatever superpower it is that i would need to jump over the damn hurdles but i'm stalling...i'm stalling because i don't want to make a decision and get stuck...i'm unsure about so many things and i guess i just can't not be sure before i make a move...

the up side to this whole thing though is that I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN! my life is so fucking unstable but it's soooo much fun!!! i've never felt this happy and free...so yeah, i have the occasional guilt trips...but a part me wishes that this stage in my life never ends...the past year was shit...c'mon, cut me some slack...i wanna have fun!!! so yeah, i'm taking every moment in, blah, blah, blah...one of these days, it will have to end...i'm thinking sooner than later...and then i'll be more responsible...like when i get back home or something...and yeah, i'm telling myself all of this so i can rest easy and sleep well at night without my conscience bothering me too much! :p

all the &quot;life&quot; shit aside, I REALLY REALLY NEED TO GET BETTER! TANGINA, I ONLY HAVE A FEW DAYS LEFT IN SF AND I WANT TO GO OUT!!!&nbsp;"

&nbsp;
updates are a bitch

nothing much to say...i've seen the most beautiful places in the world while i enveloped myself in self-destruction.

exes are a pain
relapses are a no-no
vices catch up with you and you eventually have to pay


i haven't exactly been living my life right. that much i know...i am a mess...but i'm working on it
it just sucks when certain people refuse to disappear even after you've threatened to alert the village guards and ban them from your subdivision because they do nothing but aid in your self-destruction...

my favorite part is when they claim love...something they know nothing about...it's even worse when they claim they're different and you have to pull out your mean streak to wake them up to the fact that they're nothing special and they're just like everyone else...

i'm not in denial. i was in love. but he's dead....you can't do much with a corpse, can you?;)

PEOPLE WILL GO REALLY LOW FOR THE SAKE OF FAME. really really really low!

moving on... yeah, i gotta get my act together.&nbsp;

alanis morissette is brilliant...another favorite line: &quot;I've never had this lack of ache for dalliance&quot;&nbsp;

oh and yeah, relapses, relapses, relapses...blast from the super past relapses MUST BE AVOIDED. they will do nothing but add complexity to one's already-complicated life.&nbsp;

but if i must indulge myself (for a minute MAX!)&nbsp;to something akin to a relapse, i would definitely go foo!:)

&quot;and i wonder, when i sing along with you...if anything could ever feel this real forever...if anything could ever be this good again.&quot;:)&nbsp;"

It's that simple. This suggests that it isn't love that is so important to us but the mystery itself. The love connection may be merely a device to put us in contact with the mystery, and we long for love to last so that ecstasy of being near the mystery will last. It is contrary to the nature of mystery to stand still. Yet it's always there, somewhere, a world on the other side of the mirror (or the Camel pack), a promise in the next pair of eyes that smile at us. <strong>We glimpse it when <u>we</u> stand still.&nbsp;</strong><br />The romance of new love, the romance of solitude, the romance of objecthood, the romance of ancient pyramids and distant stars are means of making contact with the mystery. When it comes to perpetuating it, however, I got no advice. But I can and will remind you of two of the most important facts i know:<br />1. <u>Everything</u> is part of it.<br />2. It's never too late to have a happy childhood.<br /></em><br />i'm pretty sure about the first one but i'm still trying to figure number 2 out. :)<br /><br /><br />and Murakami:<br /><br /><em>Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something <u>inside</u> of you. <strong>So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so that sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step.</strong> There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.<br /><br />And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, <strong>make no mistake about it: it will cut through your flesh like a thousand razor blades.</strong> People will bleed there, and <u>you</u> will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.<br /></em><strong><em>And once that storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm is all about.&nbsp;</em></strong><br /><br />here's to moving on...hopefully. :)"

i'm helping my mom with work right now...but i still feel as if it's lacking...i still feel incompetent...maybe it's just the time of the month....and realistically speaking, my body NEEDS a break...i've pushed it too hard and i'm starting to feel the effects....and yet i still feel like there's so much more to do...so much more to accomplish...so much more to learn....

sometimes i envy the college dropouts who were able to fit in the &quot;real world&quot;....school is just a bubble....but it's where i see myself the most...as a student, not a teacher....it's kinda funny so i told my parents i want to take another major and then take my masters and then a doctorate....anything to avoid the real world...it just gives me the creeps...they saw through it immediately!&nbsp;they told me i'm just trying to avoid working...i know i am...maybe there's some sort of research company i can work for that focuses on history or something....coz i only know one thing right now...i like to read! that's it! my writing skills are obviously nothing special...i don't like dealing with people....i don't want to work for events...i am incapable of kissing ass...and don't even get me started on numbers...i don't really have extraordinary skills that can recommend me anywhere....my skills are mediocre...

i don't want to let my parents down...i don't want to let myself down....but my very make-up is a let down on its own....so i can't help but sink into some pathetic form of self-loathing....please just let this be the time of the month!:P &nbsp;

idleness is toxic...i get depressed every time i'm idle....i can't not have short term goals...long term may be questionable...but i never run out of short term goals...they keep me sane...they keep me going...i don't know when this whole thing started....but all i know is that i need to be busy ALL THE TIME...i need to be setting my sights on something and trying to achieve it ALL THE TIME....idle moments make me overthink...and they make me evaluate my life....and it's hella depressing....whether it be writing a song, following my book list, school work, office work....i have to be doing something all the time..."

she would always pacify me when i fought with my parents...she used to take me out of the room and tell me not to push their buttons anymore...she would always do it with a smile, and more recently, by offering me a cigarette and then we'd end up smoking together...the last time she did it was during the pageant, when i felt bad because of some family shit...we stood up and she told me we could smoke in the judges' room...in a way she was kind of like an extended grandmother...most of the people in carousel are in some way like family to me...i just visited her yesterday but she couldn't talk anymore...she had a seizure and i was so worried but i was able to blink back the tears...her hand was so cold so i held it to warm it up...after she got out  of it, all of us surrounded her...and i was smiling, on the verge of laughing because i was so relieved...she smiled back through the nebulizer and that was basically our last interaction...
she always gave me advice when we'd smoke together...in most of the memories that come to mind, we were smoking together...i guess because they're the most recent ones...
i don't know what else to say...i consider myself fortunate to have known someone like her...anyone who's ever known her should consider themselves fortunate..."

my mother wonders how i can stay up the whole night...as in just stay up, stuck in my room, not doing much...there's a comforting feeling that comes with being the only one awake while everyone else in the house is asleep...it's very very very peaceful...and i try to take advantage of peace in any form....but i think it's time to go back to normal after tonight (though i doubt it will push through) coz my sleeping habits have made me feel detached from the real world somehow...and i'm afraid of being completely detached...because i have this tendency to get carried away sometimes, and i lose my grip on reality...so i will try to fix my sleeping habits, i guess...i just don't know when...

i took fluimucil again...so far i haven't found harmful effects that come with taking fluimucil regularly online...but this has to stop some time too...

""the bright, tight, forever drum could not describe nightswimming."" :)

it just gets better every year...i have to say that october 28 was the highlight of my sembreak...i told my parents in advance that there was no way i would be going to any of their ms. earth events that day...it was a good break...we slept through the morning...it was kind of like christmas because we had the whole gift giving thing...we went to three different bookstores and bought lots of books...he got me this really nice orange rose...but it's dry na...my helpers are helping me press it...hahaha! there are no words to describe it...describing it with words won't do it justice...i was just generally happy that day...it was so nice! it was like for one whole day all my feelings of resentment disappeared...it would a stretch to say that it was almost holy...but it felt like a movie...everything was special...it's one of those days i wish i could be able to go back to...i really don't know how he does it!:)
we watched highschool musical 3...i'm not a fan but even that was good...it's one of my favorite days ever ever ever...it wasn't the loud, exciting kind of fun (that can get tiring)...it was very peaceful...one would never expect it because we argue a lot, but there's this peaceful feeling that being with marco brings out...
work ended last sunday...and though i didn't really have a set job description, it was tiring...i'm glad to be back in school...i'm glad it's over...it was hard to be pleasant all the time...to keep my opinions to myself...to deal with cranky foreigners...to laugh it off when all i wanted to do was shoot someone...the whole thing was tiring...it definitely had its perks...some of the girls were really sweet...i'm visiting ms. netherlands in the summer...but it would have been nice if marco were there...he didn't attend a single event...and it was kind of funny because people always look for him...even if they've never met him...hahaha!!! 
anyway the stress that came with work just made me appreciate the 28th even more during the sembreak...:)

"event","it's almost christmas and i'm still in school...this is the first christmas in a long time that i'm not attempting to complete simbang gabi...missed the first one already...i wish i could control my anger...maybe i am too fatalistic for my own good...always looking for something or someone else to blame...always running away from the big things...ewan ko ba...i would probably be freud's favorite patient if he were still alive...i know my faults...i know my ghosts...the only thing i can't seem to accept is that i can change things if i wanted to...because blaming my childhood traumas are easier...at least that wouldn't make it my fault...i'm still angry...actually i'm extremely angry...because they can't stop talking...because they can't leave me alone...because i end up doing things i don't want to do and it makes me feel trapped...because things that shouldn't be taken out on me are being taken out on me...because <b>every</b> christmas they find a new way to get me in trouble...because i wasn't able to react andblow up years ago...because i'm keeping a lot inside...because i can't deal with the ghosts i know...i'm all theory...that's all i'm about...but you can't make me take action...i don't do action...because action wouldn't give me a right to be angry...and i like having the right...it makes things easier...because that would mean that i'm not in control of how i'm feeling...because it gives me a reason to blow up without feeling like such a bad person after...and responding with hostility is easier than responding with love...so yeah, i'm angry...i'm as angry as i can get...and i just really want to scream...the things that were haunting me a decade ago are the same things that are haunting me now...it makes me wonder if i ever really responded with maturity...because i thought brushing it aside was mature...i thought escapism was mature...i don't even think i'm capable of giving love purely because there's always distrust and hostility attached to it...<br />i know all of this...i know what i should be doing...i know what would get me over it...but it requires too much...and i'm not emotionally ready for it...there are too many bad memories...there's too much hostility in me, i don't even know what to do with it anymore...it's kind of like my smoking...i know it'll eventually kill me but there are too many factors that are dependent on it...stopping would mean adjusting and changing my lifestyle...something i'm not enough of a person to do...<br />i've been angry for too long...so much of my life is dependent on it...it's been so long that it's become a part of who i am and i don't think i know anything else...i've<b> never</b> not had baggage...i can't even remember a time when it wasn't part of me..."

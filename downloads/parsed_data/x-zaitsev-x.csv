"event","-a little interior monolgue type schizoid rant taken from the life of will-

its going to work out. last time you ended up making a fool of yourself and we cant let that happen again. it works out you fucking bitch. its just highschool, and not to sound like a prick but plenty of girls like you. you know it. yea you loved her, but seriously. think about it on a systematic technical scale. roughly 7.2 billion people spread across this earth. if theres a girl who you care this much about who lives in the same STATE as you, then odds are high if you look. if you search. if you put some fucking effort into it. you can find a seemingly perfect girl. Hell with those odds. i'd be suprized if anyone were with their true love. so dont worry will, its going to be just fine."

"event","this drama i cause, thats all i cause is drama. i just make people turn against each other. people like me, and i still dont know why. girls, dont like me, gabe is right i suck. just leave me be, its killing me too. having you all feeling sad, and depressed and thinking you're too fat. its not true. non of you are fat or should be depressd. im not blaming you because i cant. you cant be blamed for the way you feel about somone. although i am really sorry for being here and making all of this mess. im really sorry for girls i like, girls who i either ( make feel uncomforatble, or ""guilt trip"") i am im sorry. girls im really not worth your time. so i think i might leave the school. i hurt soo many people. its not worth it for me or you. i dont fucking do anything here anyway. im not very talented. im just good at improv. so im strongly considering leaving. this school is killing me and you."

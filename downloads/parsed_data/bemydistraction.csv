Floor- 9.05 :D
Vault- 8.725 with a 9.0 start value.. who does that?
Bars- 8.5 not my best, but I'm happy with it
Beam- 8.8 finally stuck the stupid routine. 
AA- 35.075 wowwwww I never thought I'd get a 35 in my first year level 8. anddd 17th out of 42 girls. crazyy

so I was sick tuesday and wednesday. I really was. And I came back and people were giving me crap about how I purposely skipped so that I could finish my Bio project. EXCEPT NOT. Try throwing up at 12:30 in the morning and then seeing if you want to go to school the next day. Yeah, that's what I thought.

Driver's Ed ends really soon. And I'm really happy about that. Longest two months of my life, but it will all be worth it. April vacation, apparently not sooner, is when my dad's letting me go for my license. How nicee.

what else.. 
I hate livejournal. I don't even know why I do it. 
I probably won't do it for much longer.


So some certain people have really been bugging me lately. Seriously, grow up. Let's make a big deal about everything and make people feel bad about themselves.
You know what, I realized that now I'm in a really bad mood. So i should probably stop typing soon before I say anything I'll regret.

Practice was good tonight, except since I still don't feel like my normal self, floor and beam were interesting. I wish I could control my arms and legs better when I'm wicked tired but nooo.
And Becky finally watched the Notebook. My god, I love that movie. <33

Jamie's birthday is sooooon. Monday to be exact. My little girl is growing up! haha jk, you're not a little girl, but I dooooo loveee youuuu.

I need to go shopping for new clothes, too. Real bad. 

La la la, its 11:30 and I have nothing to do. Easter is this weekend, so Caitlin can drink Coke again soon. 
I have a meet on my half-birthday. States to be exact. OMG STATES. I'm thinking my mom shouldn't go, since I do better when she's not there. Then again, the jackets for Regionals this year are, to put it bluntly, ugly. Canary yellow just isn't my thing. Who knew. 
I think that's it for now. Longgggg. You don't have to comment, I don't really care anymore."

Speak up in praise or complaint. The more you express yourself honestly and with love, the more you'll receive as well. You're surrounded by equals who are ready to take you at your word. Communication breaks down an old barrier, making you available to someone who has admired you from afar. Writing letters and sending email are especially favored methods of getting in touch with loved ones this evening."

Get a little peace and quiet after running around out there in all the haste and noise. Be sure to give yourself a pat on the back for your heroic efforts, too. And if you're still brooding over the way things have turned out/are going/might turn out -- well, don't. It's time to lay that burden down. Check that luggage -- don't carry it with you. You'll enjoy this journey so much more.

You want to shout your newly discovered feelings from the rooftops today, but it might be best to keep them to yourself for just a bit longer. Emotional responses are true to your heart, but may be inappropriate in certain situations. Do your best to keep your personal and professional life separate from each other. There is no need to take anything personally. Tonight, an outburst could injure innocent people. Make sure you have all the facts before saying anything."

It's possible to be part of the community without stifling your own needs. Look around for unexpected solutions and don't be afraid to ask someone older and wiser for their take on things. It's surprising how many things stay the same.

hmm..my horoscopes from here are almost always correct..its scarry

AND mine for tommorow friday seems correct also..
this is interesting



Go ahead and scream and yell if you need to, especially if you've got your support group around you. They'll understand. If you can't express your emotions around friends and family, then when can you? Right now, getting all hot and bothered feels good. Your extreme behavior suggests that you may be making up for lost time. Later on, you might want to retreat and take some time to think about what just happened. Reject an invitation politely but firmly."

An affair of the heart hits a bumpy spot in the road. Objectivity may be the only thing that can get it back on track. Spot the pure intention behind an imperfect action. Most people are still works in progress (thank goodness), and this person is no exception. Understand that both they and you will change from day to day. If you can grow together, that will be wonderful. If you cannot, then at least you can proceed on your path a little wiser. Trust that everything happens for a reason

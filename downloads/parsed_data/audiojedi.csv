"event","Got to see Cloverfield last night.<a href=""http://arcadia.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=21152601648&amp;ref=mf""> Read my review here</a>. If you want to stay surprised, just know that the movie is EPIC!!!<br /><br />Auditions for <i>Waiting for Lefty</i> and <i>Evenings of Improv</i> were this weekend too. Auditions themselves went pretty awesome, and I'm cast as Clayton in <i>Lefty</i>. Need to re-read the script, but 99% sure I'm not exactly a good guy. I know for a fact I'm a spy infiltrating a taxi driver union, but that's all I remember right now. Still pretty badass though. So I have about two weeks until I start living in the theater again until mid-April. Sounds like fun...<br /><br />I wound up joining student activist club in a strange half-joking deal with the president of said club. Was actually pretty cool. Until such time as rehearsal claims my soul, I think I'll be going pretty often. Plus since then I've decided I need more Rage Against the Machine in my life. The two aren't completely related, but it gave me an excuse to listen to something I'd been trying to find a reason to hear for awhile. So I bought <i>Battle of Los Angeles </i>on Amazon and iTunes'd the first album. Good stuff. Also joined martial arts club randomly too. Not sure how much that one's gonna agree with the schedule, but we'll see.<br /><br />Rundown of classes so far<br />Science in Civ: Probably gonna be better than last semester. Professor is far more interesting to listen to and better people in it. Still no firm attendance policy and its my only class on Fridays, so the temptation to skip is definitely there, but not as high as last semester with Cooper.<br /><br />Scenic Practicum: Theater class with Chris Kleckner. Game on. Might decide to run crew for <i>Tempest</i> which would be another nail in the coffin of my freetime, but need to talk to Chris and see if I can do both <i>Tempest</i> and be in <i>Lefty</i>. Won't know till next week.<br /><br />Writing and Communications: It's rarely a good sign when my professor a)strolls into class 10 minutes late with barely an apology, and b)speaks in such rambling thoughts and in such a manner that a bunch of us turn to each other and ask if we think she's stoned. Oh yeah and I wanna punch a couple people in that class...this is gonna be the Visual Cultures of this semester<br /><br />Theatre History: Johnathan is pretty awesome, and sounds like he's gonna make the course better than it would normally sound. And Dash and Ren are in it, so its a repeat of Visual Cultures/Video I. Kickass.<br /><br />Pluralism: Only had class in the large group, which wasn't nearly as infuriating as large group in Global Justice was. Not the most exciting of material, but I'll live. Though from all accounts I've heard, once we're in smallgroup I'm gonna want to punch people. Gonna take a bit to see how I feel on this one.<br /><br />That's about it. Going into Philly for a community service thing tomorrow, so bedtime is imminent. Catch you all later.<br /><br />==TJ=="

-Classes
-Rehearsal for Love of the Nightingale, which will be absolutely FUCKING AMAZING. If you're in the Philly area around mid-October, come see it!
-I'm mentoring Bill Meier's First Year Seminar course on Science Fiction. Lily, Jill, Pondo, and the like, you would love this class. Cool people, and I get to spend an hour and a half watching movies and eating food. GREAT SUCCESS!
-Tourguiding in the mornings twice a week.
-Trying to run the radio club, with some things more successful than others.
-Keeping up a social life with my 7 roommates and friends and stuff.

That's pretty much my life these days. When things slow down enough I'll give a real update on some of the specifics of what's happened, but the Facebook has a lot of that, so yeah, catch you guys when I've got more time!

Check out the pics when you get a chance.<br /><br />I'm too lazy to do a real update right now, I'll do one later in the week or maybe early next week.

"event","So I wake up yesterday morning and my computer's video card decides to go kablooey. Gives me some screwed up version of the Blue Screen of Death, and then when I restart the bastard, the monitor isn't responding. So I'm on the house computer till Monday-ish when the magic little repair place gets through with it. 

Went to Jeremy's birthday party last week. That was fun, to say the least.... then Sunday was the Arcadia reunion out at Katie's house. Lots of Dalmuti and Settlers, and one fucked up game of Monopoly. Good times, except for the part where TJ's stomach was being weird. Then that night was Meredith's grad party, where my second wind kicked into overdrive and everything was happy and such. Since then life's been pretty boring. Lots of playing Xbox, watching Scrubs, and other random things that aren't terribly interesting. Saturday is Jacqui's grad party, and then a week from that I leave for ETC.

Oh yeah probably shoulda mentioned that. Yeah I'm interning up at ETC this summer. Finding a job in Ridley was a pain, and the more I thought about it the more I realized that going up to Eagles Mere for a summer was probably a good thing. So from the 23rd till sometime in early August I'm gonna be very hard to find.

I think that just about does it...wanted to remind everyone that I'm not dead. Facebook might have something later.

"event","If you're reading this on Facebook, sorry for all the music-based entries. I have it set to take my music blog feed and I've devoted a lot of time to that in the past week or so. But I'm back to real life for a little bit.<br /><br />Pirates 3 was Saturday night. In the interest of not giving stuff away, it wasn't quite as good as the first two, but still worth the 8 bucks to see it in theaters. I'm probably gonna see it again with the parents sometime soon. It was cool to see all the ""older"" crowd...but I'm friggin' tired of being the youngest. Actually, I'm friggin' tired of being reminded I'm so young, but whatever.<br /><br />The job hunt has made approximately zero progress. Wawa bent me over and fucked me up the ass last week when it decided it didn't want to hire a seasonal worker, so that really sucked, but Chrissy pointed me in the direction of Charlie Brown's, who's apparently in need of servers. And when all else fails there's the co-op. But I think if I decide against Charlie Brown's I'm gonna go up and intern at ETC this summer. In fact I haven't decided if ETC isn't what I wanted to do all along. Getting away from it all for six weeks might actually prove to be good for me.<br /><br />I think that just about does it. Here's hoping this summer doesn't suck. I'll be back later in the week...<br /><br /><i><b>Throw it away<br />Forget yesterday<br />We'll make the great escape...<br /><br /></b></i>==TJ==<i><b><br /></b></i>"

"event","<i><b>""...then CHEER THE FUCK UP!!""</b></i><br />~Chris Carabba<br /><br />So yeah ended up going to the MtvU campus invasion tour yesterday. Suffice it to say it was freakin' amazing. Got Ronnie Day to sign my copy of <i>The Album</i>, which basically made the whole day worth it. Augustana was surprisingly awesome live, given how mellow their album is. Got some free stuff, and just generally had some awesome time. Rather than do some half-assed disorganized account, I will present to you the following:<br /><br /><u><b>High Points of the Day</b></u><br />-Monster brought out one of its trucks to give away free Monster to everyone waiting in the long-ass line on Columbus Blvd. to get into the show. If you've never had Monster before, be aware it should be had sparingly, especially if you're me.<br />-Meeting and getting an auotgraph from Ronnie Day before anyone realized who he was<br />-Being about 4 rows away from 2 of the 3 opening acts (Kidz in the Hall and K-OS...Kenna was wrapping up by the time I got there)<br />-The hut where they were giving away all kinds of free stuff and had awesome games when you didn't feel like hearing the music<br />-Very nearly catching some of the swag the Mtv emcee was throwing off the stage.<br />-Sunshowers. When the rain comes, all the silly MTV kids run for the hut, so I can take their spot near the stage.<br />-The awesome dude that conned a roadie into giving him one of K-OS's drumsticks<br />-Augustana rocks surprisingly hard for being a piano-based band<br />-Augustana's extra 3-minute jam session near the end of ""Boston""<br />-Being about 15 feet from Travis (guy from Gym Class Heroes) and not realizing it<br />-GCH's tirade about fans who come up to him and start rapping (""After a show, I'm all tired and sweaty, and all I really wanna do is get into my pajamas, get into bed and watch some Grey's Anatomy!""<br />-Front row, stage left for Ronnie Day<br />-Ronnie Day going unplugged after his guitar battery dies (more on that later)<br />-Working my way up to within 4 rows of the stage (stage right side) in time for Dashboard's set and never being more than 8 rows away from the stage.<br />-Dashboard Confessional still playing old-school songs and letting the crowd sing along<br />-DC's tribute to VA Tech students, hence the quote above and a cover of ""Teenage Dirtbag""<br />-Closing out the show with ""Hands Down"" + jam session<br />-All of the above and still being home before midnight<br /><br /><u><b>Not-So Good Parts<br /></b></u>-In my rush to get out in time to catch the train, I forgot to grab my camera.<br />-Walking from Market St. to the Festival Pier. Never realized how long that walk was.<br />-The dumbasses in front of me in line to get into the show<br />-The Guitar Hero tourney in the hut didn't have any songs unlocked and you couldn't hear the game music for crap...poor execution...<br />-The MTV emcee was kind of a jerk. For a minute I thought he was Jay-Z, but I doubt Jay-Z would blast ""This Is Why I'm Hot"" so shamelessly.<br />-Schools that had flags or banners represented at the show: Penn State, UPenn, St. Joe's, Temple, Albright, one or two others. Despite having a surprising number of students there, Arcadia gets snubbed.<br />-The dumb chain-smoking bitches during Augustana's set that kept yelling about how dumb and stupid they were and how they were just there for Gym Class Heroes. Look, if you don't like the band that's playing, quit ruining it for the rest of us and leave till your act comes on!<br />-The long-as-hell line to get an autograph from Augustana<br />-OK, so after Ronnie Day's guitar battery dies, he gets down on the ground and we all form a campfire circle around him while he plays (keep in mind he's on the 2nd stage and on the mainstage the emcee is giving away stuff and whatnot). We get through the first chorus of ""Outside"" when suddenly our singing is drowned out by none other than ""This Is Why I'm Hot"". We all proceed to boo and ultimately Ronnie's set is cut tragically short. Fuck You MTV!!!<br />-Food at the Pier is mad expensive. A 20 oz. Powerade set me back 3 bucks!<br />-Stupid MTV kids that bitch about wanting to see Dashboard so much, but by the time he starts playing they stand there like zombies with no expressions on their face. And during the older tracks, they're noticably not singing along. Coincidence? I think not!<br />-The dumbass who screamed ""JUST PLAY!!"" when Chris Carabba asked for a moment of silence for VA Tech. I hope this guy got curbstomped.<br /><br />All in all, awesome concert, and now I want to go to another this summer. Under the cut I have an apporximation of Dashboard's set list (might've gotten the order of some tracks wrong) and some pictures of the stuff I got.<br /><div text=""Set List and Pics"" class=""ljcut""><u><b>Dashboard's set<br /></b></u>Don't Wait<br />Rooftops and Invitations<br />The Good Fight<br />The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most<br />Again I Go Unnoticed<br />Screaming Infidelities<br />Teenage Dirtbag<br />So Long, So Long<br />Vindicated<br />Stolen<br />Hands Down<u><b><br /><br /><img width=""175"" height=""263"" src=""http://a20.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/5/l_b522e91b4932072666b147a6c1d33973.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /></b></u>One of the two posters for the event I got.

My Schedule for next year, proving that I must REALLY hate myself:

Monday
Science in Civ. 12:15-1:20
Visual Cultures 1:30-2:10
Sci/Civ Lab 6:00-8:30

Tuesday
Scene Study 9:30-11:30
Video Production 2:10-3:50

Wednesday
Science/Civ 12:15-1:20
Visual Cultures 2:10-3:50

Thursday
Scene Study 9:30-11:30
Video Production 2:10-3:50

Friday
Science/Civ 12:15-1:20
Stage Combat 3-6

OK, that doesn't look as bad as I first thought. But still...a night lab AND 3 hour class on a Friday? What happened to my happy little 65 minute classes? I miss those.

In other news, me, Gina, and Kara are looking to get tix to see Dashboard, Gym Class Heroes, Augustana, and Ronnie Day at Penn's Landing on the 29th. For 15 bucks a shot plus the stupid internet charge, I think it's doable. Only issue is the tix will get mailed home, so Kara'd have to drive me home to pick 'em up. Won't know for certain till next weekend when paychecks come in.

OK I'm done for now. I'll be back once this weekend passes, unless of course next week goes to hell (which it just might...more later)

"event","Finally finding an opportunity to update. I know its been awhile, so let's go over what's gone on;

-Overall life's pretty good right now. There was a brief period where it was a little touch-and-go, but it's all awesome-filled now.

-Don't remember if I mentioned this here, but I'm treasurer for the ARC. Not a huge deal but it puts me in pretty solid position to take over the club if i so choose. Also means I have a better time slot for my show (Tuesdays and Thursdays 4-6PM). Danielle's also now my co-DJ, so we've got my awesome mainstream rock-ness and her all-over-the-place indie punk style. Makes for a kickass show. But you already knew that.

-Landed a spot on SPB's exec board as the comedy chair. Basically this means I'm responsible for bringing comedians to campus. Pretty awesome. Going to a retreat with the rest of the board to get to know them (note that my girlfriend and best friend are already on the board) this weekend. Only going like 2 blocks off campus, but still something different. But this also basically means that my free time is dwindling very quickly, hence why I haven't been updating all that much.

-Classes aren't that bad. Bill Meiers (Global Justice and English prof.) is out of his freaking mind, and for that he is amazing. Mark Wade's a good guy, and Method Acting is the last-ditch effort to keep me in the theatre program. Chris Mullin and Into./Comm. is pretty awesome, even though it's a perfect example of the ""Arcadia Ratio"" (There are 8 people in the class, I'm the only guy.) The rest of my classes are about what I expected. And for added fun, NO PRACTICUM!!! TJ gets credit for everything he does!!!

-For all my technologically inclined readers; my digital camera's LCD screen cracked; is there any way to repair this, salvage the camera and/or get a replacement screen? It would really suck if this thing is useless now.

That pretty much covers it. I'll be back eventually.

"event","With the xanga all but defunct, this and the myspace blog are gonna start getting most of the entries these days. I'm looking for a good place to start an entirely music-oriented blog. Last.fm is OK, but its too low profile and I don't see the kind of thing I'm looking for in it. Any suggestions on a new spot are welcome.<br /><br />While I'm thinking about it, new entry on the <a href=""http://www.last.fm/user/AudioNinja/journal/"">Last.fm blog</a>, not attached to that project I mentioned last time. Check it out if you feel like it. Meantime, some musings on what I'm excited for in 2007.<br /><br /><b>Fall Out Boy</b> - The only band to have its album complete and ready to release so far, excitement is already builiding for the February 6th release of <i>Infinity on High</i>. The first single ""This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race"" has been climbing radio charts for a few weeks now, and early listens to the album suggest an angrier FOB. Frontman Pete Wentz already admitted that ""This Ain't A Scene..."" was written in response to criticism he and his band received since exploding onto the scene in 2005. Perhaps all the touring and exposure has left FOB a bit jaded? If the result sounds like the first single, then more, please!<br /><br /><b>Jimmy Eat World</b> - The Tempe, AZ band has already announced that they will be rereleasing their first two LPs, <i>Clarity</i> and <i>Static Prevails</i> on May 15th with bonus tracks and demos. In addition, they are in the studio finishing up the new yet-to-be-titled album, hoping for an early summer release. In my exploration of oldschool emo I tried out a few tracks from the early albums and I gotta say, I was really impressed. Reports from the JEW camp call the new album 'eclectic', containing a little bit of everything fans have come to expect and then some. Look for a tour to accompany the new album.<br /><br /><b>Omnisoul</b> - Odds are you've never heard of this Wilmington, DE based band. There only two tracks come from the soundtracks to <i>Fantastic 4</i> and <i>Madden 2007</i>. From the former, ""Waiting (Save Your Life)"" is a pretty nice rock ballad, the kind of thing you might expect from The All-American Rejects. ""Not Giving Up"" from the Madden 07 soundtrack, is exactly what you'd expect from such a playlist; a bouncy, upbeat locker room anthem with the slightest twinge of an angry Maroon 5. The band signed to Wind-Up Records (also home to Evanescence, Alter Bridge, and the now-defunct Creed) early in 2005, and after endless touring, the band should have its first full-length release out sometime this year. The band has been compared to Howie Day, Coldplay and John Mayer. If you're a fan of any of them, keep your ears peeled.<br /><br /><b>Linkin Park</b> - The rap-rock quintet went into the studio in November to begin work on their fourth studio album with nearly 120 tracks to work from. The band expects to cull the best 18 tracks into a full-length album. According to a story in a November issue of Rolling Stone, producer Rick Rubin has encouraged the band to look beyond the formulaic rap/scream vocals and crunching guitars that led to the success of their previous albums. The band is aiming for a March release, perhaps aiming to compete with Guns N Roses (more on them later) and beat Metallica to the CD racks. Say what you will about <i>Reanimation</i>, but I think Linkin Park has yet to release a truly unimpressive record, and if they really do back away from the rap-metal influence, they could have something really big on their hands.<br /><br /><b>Disturbed - </b>Still riding the success of 2005's <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i>, its unlikely that Disturbed is in any rush to release new material. But with System Of A Down and Staind each taking a hiatus and Ozzy unlikely to appear on this summer's Ozzfest, look for Disturbed to rule the hard rock/metal world for awhile. You might see Disturbed and (Mudvayne/Pantera project) Hellyeah! to be a big draw in time for the summer tour craze. Ever since <i>Believe</i> I thought Disturbed was wildly underrated and lost in SoaD's shadow. It took till this past Ozzfest for me to be proven right, now let's see how it pans out from here.<br /><br /><b>Guns N Roses - </b>No punchline here. I'm serious. If Axl Rose is serious about a March 6th release for <i>Chinese Democracy</i>, then count me in to be buying it that day. Consider it another example of the <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> Effect. Thanks to the delays, broken promises, and the fact that Rose is the only remaining original member (everyone else left and formed Velvet Revolver), expectations are so low that all Rose has to do is release a half-decent CD on that date and those who buy it will probably be satisfied, if not pleasantly surprised. If Rose is smart, he'll bring a tour around, complete with that crazy dance move of his and the occasional fight or two. I don't think its possible for Axl Rose to lose here.<br /><br />That does it for me. If you're still here I'm impressed.<br /><br />==TJ=="

"event","First, a big thanks to the people who offered their ears and mouths (well, eyes and keystrokes at least) on my last entry. I think I'm alright now. I was gonna get into it again, but decided not to.<br /><br />Earlier in the week I went to Borders and picked up a book called <u>Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers and Emo</u>. It's all about how the whole concept of emo, both as a music form and a subculture in America, formed. The author (Andy Greenwald, if any of you read <i>Spin</i>) traces it back to the fusing of hardcore and indie rock in the mid-80s and profiles all these emo bands from the late '90s all the way up to 2002 (when the book was published). As such I've been listening to these late-90s indie bands like Braid, Texas is the Reason, Mineral, The Promise Ring, etc. If you've heard of any of these bands, I'd be amazed. One of the best things is how he wrote the book two years before bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! At The Disco exploded, and yet he explains how bands like them are NOT emo. Greenwald explains that emo was an escape from the irony and layers of meaning that riddled the mainstream rock of the late 80s-early 90s. Emo has none of that. It's free of all irony; it's just a simple, naked catharsis from a band reaching out to fans that needed a connection (a group into which the bands often fell into as well). It's kinda hard to explain, but if you're interested I really reccomend the book so far (I'm a little over 100 pages in). So yeah that's a glimpse into what's on my iPod right now.<br /><br />The scary thing about this is, I actually found myself considering giving the likes of Hawthorne Heights a second chance. Someone tell me if this is a terrible idea, please. <br /><br />I've got a new project on my last.fm page I'm trying out. It's basically me offering thoughts, musings, anecdotes, whathaveyou about songs that have left some mark on me. If you ever read <u>Songbook</u> by Nick Hornby, it's kinda like that, but not nearly as eloquent. I could use some feedback and just the knowledge that people read the things I write. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/user/AudioNinja/"">Link is here.</a> Go to the most recent blog entry. You need to be a last.fm user to comment on that page but if you want leave a message here. Or if you ask really nicely, I'll add the entries to the LJ. It'd give me an excuse to update this thing more frequently than I do.<br /><br />I think that just about does it. Wow, its earlier than I thought....<br /><br /><i><b>Forget what we're told<br />Before we get too old<br />Show me a garden that's bursting into life...<br /></b></i><br />==TJ=="

"event","<div text=""Warning; TJ actually thinks in this one. Parents are asked to skip this one."" class=""ljcut"">I'm pretty sure I had a bit too much caffeine last night, and more than likely I'll be paying for it tonight and maybe for a few more nights. For added fun my back is now in an immense amount of pain, and on a scale of 1 to 'shit', I think I'm rocking a solid 8.5 right now. Good times, good times...<br /><br />That said, I'm really glad I went with Gina down to Newark last night. It felt good to get that change of scenery, and, well, yeah, it was Gina. I'm pretty sure it was a better time than I would've had at Pondo's (no offense to anyone who was there). Of course, that coupled with the end-of-year survey on the facebook and that caffeine backlash, and now TJ's mind is racing, not always a good thing. I feel the need to write out some of what's in my head, and maybe it'll help if I write them someplace where people can read it and respond, so here I am now. I'm trying to type while having the internal filter in my brain turned off, hence placing this under a cut.<br /><br />That end-of-the-world feeling I get is back. There's less reason for it than ever, and yet something isn't falling into place. I really wanna believe its the weather. It's been total shit outside for the past couple days, and today when I got back home it just knocked me out. I've been pretty disillusioned with the whole world since then, and I can't really explain it. I think it has something to do with the fact that I'm in Ridley for another 2 weeks, but all the excitement of the break has come and gone, so now it's just me killing time till the 14th.<br /><br />Being with Gina and her family got me thinking about my family and I realized...we really aren't that close anymore. Yeah, some of us get together for Christmas and awhile back we had Eagles Mere, but now it's just kinda...I dunno...not really sure where that thought was headed...<br /><br />I hate it when I get like this. I can feel myself bottling things up. I went out earlier and I swear to God I felt like I was gonna start crying just for the sake of releasing all this shit, but nothing. Almost made me angrier that I felt like I was moving backward and that just made things a little worse. These past few months were the first time I can remember really changing a part of my personality. When I first got to college there was a part of me that thought that who I was was flat-out perfect. My friends helped me realize how wrong I was about that, and I started to realize that if all the things I said (and supposedly meant) were true, then things would need to change. I know I'm not perfect, and as I sit here typing I feel myself fighting back a memory of one relapse I still can't think about without it hurting. And now it's back. I don't feel like I have anywhere to go, so I just keep it all inside until something forces it out and from there it all goes to hell...<br /><br />I'd be lying to you all and to myself if I tried to say this didn't have to do with the fact that my girlfriend is a few hundred miles away. Yeah, I know; I just saw her this weekend. But that doesn't stop me from missing her still. That's another thing; I have needed other people a bit too much. I can't keep expecting other people to be there to catch me, 'cause when they aren't there for whatever reason I won't know what to do. It's not right, hell it probably isn't healthy to need people (to need <b><i>Gina</i></b>) the way I feel like i have...<br /><br />And here comes TJ's inferiority complex, just in time...<br /><br />Now seems like an alright time to end this. Feel free to comment, anything from a 'I hear ya, TJ' to a nice hearty 'Fuck you!' is acceptable. I'm probably deserving of a little of it all right about now...<br /><br /><b><i>And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this...<br /><br /></i></b></div><br />==TJ=="

"event","An update simply for the sake of an update. It's been awhile since I touched this, and in general I've been pretty bad about updating all the blogs. My readers should know that I'm debating closing down the xanga account; getting the distinct sense not many people read it anymore and it'd be one less thing to worry about not doing. At this point the people who like to keep up on what's going on in my world are on Facebook, and the beauty of RSS allows them to read this via facebook. Less work for TJ to have to do.<br /><br />I've been in Ridley since midday Tuesday. Already gotten to see most of the people I wanted to. Saw Tony and Kev Wednesday night. Tony's...well, he's Tony, and Kev's doing alright for himself. Good to see he's cleaned up a bit. Still want a chance to see Ray and all them before I go back, but there's still plenty of time. It's been kinda boring here so far, but there's a lot of break left. I really hope it gets better.<br /><br />It's only fitting that no sooner than I return home am I updated on all the neverending highschool drama that plagues my friends. Not really complaining about it, but I feel like I need to offer advice cause that's the kind of friend I am, but at the same time I'm like, ""I'm done with this, I have my own stuff to take care of."" Can't believe I'm actually about to type this, but I do feel myself slipping away from them sometimes. I haven't been great about keeping in touch, and I know certain people are apprehensive about it, but there's a part of me that knew this was gonna happen, no matter how much I would try to prevent it. And to those highschoolers, you're not too far away from my spot. Not gonna offer any advice other than to keep that in mind.<br /><br />I really do miss Glenside. Yeah it's great to see my family and seeing the grandparents on the 26th will be nice, but there's a part of me wondering if highschool has the right idea about going back on the 2nd. Like, I'm not gonna have any work to do while I'm home, and what happens in those 2 weeks after new years when we have off? How the hell am I gonna amuse myself, 'cause at the rate I'm going the computer and xbox will have worn out their amusement capacity by sometime late next week. If Tony, Kevin and the others read this, we had better figure something out. I know you guys busier than I am for the next few weeks.<br /><br />Christmas is on Monday. That's much closer than it feels. I don't know if that made sense. It's 1:15 and my brain has been mush for a solid half hour now. Yeah, Christmas Monday, Grandparents Tuesday, Godknowswhat till next Sunday, when Pondo had better be having a New Years shindig, then the 3rd I'm meeting Gina and Laura and we're all going into Philly. Tony don't forget you're coming too. That shall be a fun time. It'd be kinda pointless for me to verbalize here the fact that I miss her...but, um, well, <i><b>I do.</b></i><br /><br />Ok I think that's it for now...Catch you people later.

"event","So I moved out of Kistler and into Heinz 221N with Kevin today. Res Life is trying to close up as many of the vacancies as possible before the semester ends and since Vince is transferring (he hated it here) and Kevin's roomate never showed up, it worked out nicely. Mad props to Kara, Bill, Garey and everyone else who helped me transport all my crap across campus today.<br /><br />Yeah...it's finals week. And I don't have a serious final till Friday. Here's the rundown of this week:<br /><br /><b>Monday</b> - Last day of regular classes. English class was cancelled and I just dropped my paper (which came out better than I thought it would) in the box outside Wagner's office.<br /><b>Tuesday</b> - Reading day. All normal classes before like 2PM cancelled so as to promote students to read/study for the coming onslaught. I had my Night Class From Hell final at night. Took me a whopping 25 minutes and I'm not planning on taking another Practicum for a <i>very long time...</i><br /><b>Wednesday</b> - One-on-one meeting with Mike Whistler (Improv instructor) at 10AM. Basically to do one last reflection on all the work I did in the class and to get his feedback on the direction I'm headed. Kinda weird 'cause I'm looking at changing my major, but still good to hear my instructor's take.<br /><b>Thursday - </b>Perform my monologue (Henry Drummond from <u><i>Inherit the Wind</i></u> if you were curious) for Voice and Speech at 10:40. Then I'll probably do some studying for Japanese. And somewhere in this mess I have an English thing to wrap up and make sure my portfolio is in some kind of order.<br /><b>Friday - </b>Japanese final written exam. It's scheduled from 1-4PM, but I truly hope it's not <i>really</i> a 3-hour test. I don't see how it's possible for it to be that way, but I also don't want to find out.<br /><b>Saturday and Sunday</b> - That English assignment probably fits in somewhere around here, as does saying goodbye to Gina and anyone else who's leaving, and chilling out with the remaining crew.<br /><b>Monday (12/18)- </b>English presentations and whatnot. Again scheduled for 3 hours, but if there's a merciful God in Heaven it'll be done in 2.<br /><br />Then I'm coming home sometime on Tuesday. I have thoughts on the end of the semester and the future and all that, but they haven't been fully fleshed out yet. When I get a free chance to gather my thoughts again I'll try to take care of that.<br /><br /><b><i>So I walk up on high<br />And I step to the edge<br />To see my world below.<br />And I laugh at myself<br />As the years roll down.<br />Cause it's the world I know.<br />It's the world I know...<br /><br /></i></b>==TJ=="

Such is the life of the ill.<br /><br />It's been a weird week...a <i>very</i> weird week, ever since I got back to campus things have been all over the place.

"event","This isn't an entry so much as it is the promise of an entry. A good entry requires loud music and semi-intelligent thought. Given that it's after midnight and Vince is half asleep, I can provide neither. So in closing, check back tomorrow, and I promise there'll be something worth reading.<br /><br />EDIT: I was planning this about 4 hours ago, but then I found out that Garey and Ed got Guitar Hero II, and that pretty much brought all productive activity to a standstill. But either way, I'm here now, so let's get to it.<br /><br />Earlier this week Gina and I broke up. Of course if this LiveJournal is your only means of keeping up with me then you didn't realize we ever got back together. Furthermore if this LiveJournal is your only means of keeping up with me you REALLY need to try harder. Either way, I'm allright. No, really, I'm alright. I've talked to people about it, and all is well. I could say more, but verbalizing what I'm thinking isn't happening well right now. Yesterday Bill and I went to Wawa and each came back with a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's, and since then most brain activity has been impaired.<br /><br />Registered for classes today. Looking at changing the major either to communications or double majoring theatre/communications. I'll see how the spring goes. Still need to register for London preview later tonight. Yeah I'm probably gonna be in London for spring break, which is all kindsa sweet.<br /><br />My music taste is all over the place right now. My constant rotation in my CD player is as follows:<br />(+44) - <i>When Your Heart Stops Beating</i> (4.5/5)<br />30 Seconds to Mars - <i>A Beautiful Lie</i> (4/5)<br />The Who - <i>Endless Wire</i> (4.5/5)<br />My Chemical Romance - <i>The Black Parade</i> (4.5/5)<br />Angels &amp; Airwaves - <i>We Don't Need to Whisper</i> (4/5)<br /><br />Well, that would be my rotation if not for the fact that my headphones finally up and died earlier this week. And for added fun Bill has successfully gotten me to test the water in the universe of country music. I've commissioned Bill to create his hand-selected Best of Garth Brooks for me to start out. Say whatever the hell you want about this subject, I've never particularly cared what other people think of my music taste.<br /><br />Godspell tech starts Saturday. Not gonna lie; not really looking forward to this. I mean it's kinda cool that I'm light board opping, but the time commitment is absolutely murder. Thank God there are only like 3 more Night Classes From Hell and then I'm done till at least sophomore year. I hate this idea of spending my life slaving away in a theatre for a one in a million shot at doing something big. The enjoyment I get out of theatre can be found elsewhere, hence that bit earlier about me changing majors.<br /><br />OK I think that'll be all. Don't know when I'll be updating again, but I'll try to do it in due time.<br /><br /><i><b>And somewhere on the edge of time<br />What the poets die, the words won't rhyme<br />I'll call you up and say<br />'We made it OK'<br />And somewhere in the back of your mind<br />When you see your demons come to life<br />And the world just fades away<br />You'll know it's OK...<br /></b></i><br />==TJ=="

"event","Now's a good a time as any for an update, especially given the fact that it's been a few weeks since i touched this thing.<br /><br />By now just about everyone prolly knows that Gina and I broke up, though it was the most peaceful breakup in history. To be totally honest there isn't too much else to talk about. 18th birthday is coming up, classes are going nicely, and I do pretty much have the greatest friends any college kid could ask for.<br /><br />Oh, there is something. I have a show on Arcadia's internet radio station, <a href=""http://radio.arcadia.edu"">radio.arcadia.edu.</a> I'm on Saturdays from Noon till 2 and Sundays from 10AM till noon. Check it out, it's all my kind of music, so it can't be that bad.<br /><br />I've discovered the wonderfully awesomeness that is Guitar Hero for the PS2, and it sucks up my time like none other. I make playing ""More Than A Feeling"" look like a Green Day riff. Yeah, I'm that awesome.<br /><br />As you may have gathered by the short paragraphs I actually don't have much to say. I'm gonna go watch the Mets game till Gina, Christa, Kara and Garey get back from the mall (I was taking a nap when they left, hence why I'm not with them.)<br /><br />==TJ=="

"event","A quick update before I go downtown with the LC (Learning Community).<br /><br />Went to see <em>The Break-Up</em> last night with Gina, Vince and a few others. I wanted to hate it with every fiber in my being, and don't get me wrong, it wasn't that good of a movie, but I was expecting much worse. And I don't care what Gina says, there was nothing wrong with that ending! It's now on my perpetually growing list of movies to review on RT.<br /><br />Classes have been OK so far, though EN 101 drives me nuts and I'm going to hate Practicum by semester's end (2 hrs, 40 mins every Tuesday night, including my birthday and Halloween, and not one f&amp;#@ing credit to show for it). Got a friend or two in each class, which makes things go down easier. Been spending most of my afternoons getting my ass kicked in pool by either Bill, Don, or Gina (if she gets lucky), then doing the homework at night or the next morning if it's something easy like Voice &amp; Speech. The 9AM Improv that I thought was going to kill me actually isn't that bad, and the class itself is pretty basic.<br /><br />Garey and Ed's room has now become the big hangout room, mostly due to their Xbox360/DVD player and party drawer riddled with snacks, and the fact that Garey is dating Christa (Gina's roommate). So we're all connected, and life is good.<br /><br />OK I think that'll be all. Gotta go to the theatre to meet the LC. And I need to bring a fork??<br /><br /><em><strong>And it's brighter than sunshine...</strong></em><br /><br />==TJ=="

"event","As promisedon the xanga, some random musings on the music/entertainment world.<br /><br />Upon hearing ""What's Left of Me"" on the radio a few dozen times, is it safe to say that Nick Lachey is at least a closet emokid? I mean take a look; he falls hopelessly in love with a girl, things turn ugly, they break up (for the purposes of this argument I'm willing to bet Jessica still has one of Nick's hoodies), and he then goes and records an entire album of whiny and sappy music about her. And oh yeah, tracks on said album include ""What's Left of Me"" and ""I Can't Hate You Anymore"". Give that man(?) a fauxhawk!<br /><br />I think I figured out what my problem with Fall Out Boy is; at the time <em>From Under the Cork Tree</em> came out, fellow emo-pop-punk-insert-unnecessary-hyphenated-category-here band Taking Back Sunday were probably on the verge of becoming big. Bigger than they are now. When <em>FUCT</em> got huge as a result of Pete Wentz &amp; Co. selling their souls to MTV, it forced TBS to try to copycat their sound, resulting in their most recent album. Don't get me wrong, what I've heard of <em>Louder Now</em> is pretty cool, and I in large part enjoy both FOB albums. I just wish Taking Back Sunday could have gotten the success they deserve without being overshadowed.<br /><br />After working in a restaurant where the cooks are predominantly black and thus have control of the radio in the kitchen, I think I can safely assume that rap radio only plays 6 different songs in various combonationsover the course of 24 hours. I hereby move for the following words/phrases to be blacklisted until further notice:<br />""It's Goin' Down""<br />""I Know You See It""<br />""Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It""<br />""Snap Yo Fingers""<br /><br />A challenge for my fellow music fans; listen to Rob Thomas's ""Lonely No More"", noting the melody and lyrics in the chorus. After doing this, listen to Rihanna's ""Unfaithful"", again noting the lyrics and melody in the chorus. Then try to convince me Rihanna didn't snag a hit song by ripping off Rob Thomas.<br /><br />Am I the only one who thinks Shakira sounds like a Muppet? I bring this up because with the help of a nifty piece of software Brian showed me that lets me download files from iTunes libraries to which I am connected, I just downloaded ""Hips Don't Lie"". Estimated time until I regret doing this: 14 minutes, 23 seconds.<br /><br />You folks were lucky to have been spared an angry rant tied to the difficulty I had in getting the new single by The Who. Let's just say, if you're going to promote your new music in a given area, you should make that music readily available, NOT just as an import. Either way, the single's pretty good. In no way is it ""Baba O'Riley"" or ""Pinball Wizard"" or anything from their heyday in the '70s, but it's still a solid release. I intend to pick up the album in October, that is, if they release it in America and not just Australia.<br /><br />I heard ""Let U Go"" by Ashley Parker Angel earlier today, and if I didn't know better, I woulda sworn Good Charlotte released a new single. Further listens to his music suggested the same thing. And oh yeah, didn't Avril Lavigne make it uncool to use chatspeak in song titles? <br /><br />I propose a rule that limits the amount of money a store can charge for CDs that are considered ""Classics"", ""Essentials"", or otherwise important recordings. I should not have to pay 20 bucks for a Beatles CD, unless said CD is more than one disc (<em>The White Album</em> and <em>The Wall</em> are exempt). I'm talking to <em><strong>you</strong></em>, Borders!<br /><br />A message for Taylor Hicks: You're an <em>American Idol</em> winner, which puts your shelf-life at approximately 18 months (Kelly Clarkson not included). Stop trying to prolong that time, it'll only make the end hurt more.<br /><br />Everclear frontman Art Alexakis was on ""The O'Riley Factor"" defending the video for ""Hater"", which displays a Jesus lookalike doing uncomplimentary things. This means Everclear has an album in the works. As self-appointed spokesman for the music world, allow me to issue the following statement: <em>I don't care</em>.<br /><br />Bill Simmons suggested that Suri Cruise would appear on ""The Surreal Life"" in 2026. Allow me to offer a potentially more enjoyable opportunity. In 2026 Cruise and Haley Mathers (Eminem's daughter) will replace Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie on ""The Simple Life"". But first Mathers must release at least one failed solo CD. Tell me I'm not sitting on a friggin' goldmine, people!<br /><br />Hawthorne Heights <strong><em>still sucks</em></strong>. That should be reinforced often.<br /><br />OK I think I'm done. Hope you enjoyed that little peek inside my mind.<br /><br />==TJ==<br />"

"event","So I figured its probably about time for an update. I might actually let some stuff out on this one, don't know yet.<br /><br />Work schedule is hell this week:<br />Today 4-9:30<br />Tomorrow 4-9:30<br />Thursday 4-9:30<br />Friday 6-10<br />Saturday 5-11<br />Sunday 9-3<br /><br />Hopefully I'll catch a break with next week's schedule, but I can't really promise much. I had yesterday and Sunday off though, which wasn't bad. Met up with Sean (Arcadia friend) yesterday in Northeast Philly. Went to Neshaminy Mall and saw <em>Superman Returns</em> again. If you've never been to Neshaminy Mall, think Springfield Mall all on one floor. Pretty awesome. It was cool to hang out with college friends though. We're prolly gonna try to do it again in a few weeks assuming I can catch a break with this work schedule. I think this brings me to what might be called the point of this entry. I wrote it down in the journal T-Bone gave me for graduation after the orientation, but here it is again.<br /><br />I think I'm ready now. Ready to move on and go to college. I wasn't sure before because I didn't know what to expect from the place, the people, and just the whole <em>really</em> living alone thing. But now I've tasted it and I know what's waiting for me and I'm ready to find out more. Ridley's given me all its going to offer for now I think. Don't get me wrong; it's not that there's nothing here for me anymore. So long as I have friends and family here there's a reason to come home. But I've had quite a bit of time to think about how things'll be here once I'm gone. Based on what I've seen and heard from the past few weeks, it looks to me like things'll be just fine. I don't need to be here to make the world turn the way it should. Looking back it probably hasn't ever been that way, but as of right now I know for sure. I'm ready now. Bring this whole college thing on.<br /><br />I think Jill's got it right to end this entry<br /><br /><strong><em>The north is to south what the clock is to time<br />There's east and there's west and there's everywhere, life<br />I know I was born and I know that I'll die<br />The in between is mine<br />I am mine...<br /></em></strong><br />==TJ=="

"event","Okay after a relatively annoying technical difficulty yesterday, I will now proceed to provide commentary on the Grad Party. Lemme preface it by saying it was pretty much the most awesomest thing I've ever been a part of, and I wanna thank everyone who came, my parents for helping set it up, and anyone else I mighta forgotten just then.  So yeah the afternoon actually started out at Joe Canamucio's Grad Party, which I wasn't sure I was gonna make it to. I hung out there for a while. Spent most of the time with Canamoo, Chris Sanborn, Boyle, Steve Savage, and a few others. Played Sanborn in foosball and lost, and watched the guys play horseshoes in the yard. The day's award for 'Most awesomely bad article of clothing' went to Mr. Canamucio, wearing a Chicago Enforcers XFL T-Shirt he got off the dollar rack at Modell's. Pretty sweet.  Went back to the church around 4, finished helping my folks set up and Shaner was the first guest to arrive. He and I go down and throw a frisbee around for awhile. Eventually the masses arrive, but not without having trouble directing Jacqui to the church. Everyone eventually got to the church and we made our way upstairs, examined the display made in my honor (I <strong>still</strong> can't find my JCS program...curses). Matt and I decided that a screamo cover of ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" would be surprisingly cool to make/listen to. The Ping-Pong idea didn't quite work out the way we planned, so we compensate by turning the floor into a pingpong table. And they say my friend's aren't resourceful...  Later we go back out to play some Ultimate. Didn't really work playing 7-on-7 on such a small field, but we coped. Now would be a good time to note one of the better subplots of the evening; Matt was basically flirting with Jacqui the whole night. The entire time Matt was completely unaware that Jacqui was bi, and that ""I was the last person Jacqui dated that had a ****"". Matt didn't find out till he IMed her yesterday. All who were aware of it (which was most people) had a damn good laugh at the whole thing. Finally after running around and tiring ourselves out, we go back upstairs and do the whole gift thing.  OK, for those of you who watch <em>24</em>, especially those who have seen the season that just ended, I now pretty much have the Jack Bauer man-purse, courtesy of Lunchbox. The thing really does carry <em><strong>everything</strong></em>. I was able to fit basically everything I got save for the <em>Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll</em> inside said bag. The T-Shirts were also pretty cool. They are listed below:  -""How To Be A Ninja"" -Pig Pen form the <em>Peanuts</em> (there's a kid at RHS who had this shirt and I never got a chance to tell him he had an awesome shirt. Now I have said srticle of clothing) -Ghost Rider (""Cool picture of a crappy superhero"") -Random shirt from anime I don't watch, but it's a ridiculously obnoxious yellow color, so of course I like it.  Also got a pretty cool journal from T-Bone, so if the entries here get less and less exciting it's because all the good stuff is going in there.

Figures too, we had just started watching <u><em>Pulp Fiction</em></u> when I realize I should leave before I get sick at my friend's house. I <strong>still</strong> need to see that movie. Curses.<br /><br />Besides that there's really nothing to talk about. Work today 5-10, then I'm off for the next week. Assassins on Monday, Baccalaureate Wednesday, and then apparently I'm supposed to be at the high school Thursday for some thing that the seniors do every year?

"event","So for the past week every news station in America has been doing pretty much nonstop coverage leading up to the <em>Da Vinci Code </em>movie. Personally I could not be less interested. I've not yet read the book and know very little about the controversy surrounding it. For added fun I don't plan on seeing the movie, especially given the less-than-stellar reviews tied to it. I don't see why its all causing such a huge stink.<br /><br />What I'm fascinated, and slightly confused by, is the amount of uproar a piece of entertainment has generated. I mean, a friggin' movie is causing riots, debates, and creating such backlash from the largest established relgion in the world. Has any other film, book, or event in recent history created a worldwide response the way <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> has? I get that people are somewhat offended by the religious implications, but I think many people are simultaneously reminding others of something, while forgetting that same thing; <strong>it's a work of FICTION</strong>. Maybe Dan Brown did some research prior to writing the book, as many authors do, but at the same time the guy's allowed to put what he wants in his book. Much in the same way Oliver Stone had his implications on JFK's death, Dan Brown can create any interpretations on the life of Christ he pleases. And last I checked, Brown hasn't said he believes in what he wrote, thus furthering the 'work of fiction' defense. Maybe if people stopped getting so perturbed when their ""infallible"" religion is seen in a way that might not be completely glorifying and accepted alternate possibilities, we'd be able to handle things like this better.<br /><br />That's it; I'm making everyone <strike>in America</strike><sup>around the world </sup>see <em>Dogma</em>. <br /><br />Oh, and another thing; if a piece of literature or film considered fiction can question the faith of so many people, doesn't that say something about how fickle those people are, and how easily broken their faith is? Shouldn't the church be doing more to solidify people's faith rather than going out bashing and trying to bring down <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>? I think there needs to be a shift in priorities.<br /><br />I mean, religion and entertainment have been intertwined for decades; <em>Jesus Christ Superstar, The Last Temptation of Christ, </em>and <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> to name a few. It's just another interpretation. If people are going to get upset over portrayals of Jesus, shouldn't those same people be upset with the Heaven/Hell/God imagery in <em>Lost</em>? But yet other countries think its funny as hell when we take shots at Mohammed or some other religion, and then we tell them to chill out when they get offended and stuff. Kinda ironic too how 2 years ago we all used film to restore our faith thanks to <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, and now we're using the same media to bring it down with <em>Da Vinci Code</em>.<br /><br />So I guess my point is that entertainment should be just that; it shouldn't build or destroy beliefs, cause riots, or incite revolutions. It should get people thinking, but it's not meant to cause the kind of response this has.<br /><br />And I'm serious. Everyone around the world should see <em>Dogma</em> if they're so up in arms about <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>.<br /><br />==TJ=="

"event","<strong>Once you are tagged you MUST write a blog about your 6 weird habits/things as well as state this rule clearly. In the end, you need to choose the next six people to be tagged and list their names.</strong>

1. Not that this comes as a shock to anybody, but I almost ALWAYS have my headphones on. Why, you ask? See, song lyrics express how I feel better than I ever could. Thus, music sorta becomes my way of connecting with my emotions, and making sense out of the bazillion feelings that pop through my head on a given day. A lot of people mistake my hiding behind headphones as trying to disconnnect with the world around me. Not the case; if anything it might be the opposite, if that makes sense...

2. I actually can't play drum set at all. To those of you who ever see me air drumming, you might notice it's usually the same pattern for every song.

3. If/when I fall, I fall hard, fast, and don't stop until I've come crashing to the ground in an massive, ugly, usually fiery wreck. Doesn't take much to push me off the ledge either (case in point: me and Ashley)

4. I play the 'what if?' game WAY more than any one person should. As impulsive as I can be sometimes, I always find myself going back and questioning what I've done, and what might have happened if I had done something differently. It sucks.

5. Sitting here next to me is a notebook with the Flyers logo on it (I'm working on fixing that part). Inside that notebook is a bunch of stuff I wrote down over the course of ETC this past summer, as well as some of my more recent ramblings. It is the second notebook of its kind, the first was lost earlier this year and replaced by this one. Inside this notebook along with the ramblings and things slightly more personal than what you find in this and my other weblogs. There are also the beginnings (rarely the endings) of songs I've written. No, you cannot see inside this notebook.

6. Despite how I may or may not have used to be, I <em><strong>crave</em></strong> physical and emotional contact with other people. Having that kind of unique attachment to someone, I dunno, it just gives my world another dynamic that makes it all worth trying. Such might explain why I've had so many girlfriends over the past year and a half or so. Some people call my need for contact 'clingy'. Call it whatever the fuck you want; just don't think less of me for it.

Either that or there is and my brain is moving too fast for me to be able to remember what it is. *feels in pocket to make sure prom ticket <em><strong>is</strong></em> there* OK I'm good. Wow, this is purely insane. More than likely I will not sleep until sometime mid-morning tomorrow, and even on that I make no promises.

"event","I want it noted this is the second time I'm typing this. The iBook I'm on came unplugged, and thus shut down. Isn't one of the points of laptops that you can leave them unplugged&nbsp; and they'll still function? Guess not in Ridley.<br /><br />Moral of the story: iBooks are Satan's laptop of choice.<br /><br />Seems like everyone I know is having the worst 7-10 days imaginable. My mom blames last week's total solar eclipse. That theory works for me. My only other idea involves God having a very large middle finger.<br /><br />
<div text=""Ashley and I broke up"" class=""ljcut"">I was gonna make you open this cut to read that, but I changed my mind. If you didn't read the xanga entry dated April 1st, yeah, there you go. We split Thursday night. Given another week or so I probably would've done it myself, but that doesn't mean I feel any better about it. Ashley claimed someones comments about me led to this. Manda's looking into that. Quite frankly I could give a shit; it's not like the outcome'll change. But at the same time I really hope that Shiloh or Nancy (Manda's running suspects) wouldn't stoop that low, 'cause I can't guarantee I won't go completely and totally apeshit on them both. And I know if I did I wouldn't feel the least bit sorry.<br /><br />When I told my parents on Sunday (three days after the fact), I told them I didn't particularly care to talk about it since I didn't have that much info and it wasn't what I wanted on my mind at the time. Of course that's the cue for my mom to probe the subject. And she won't even do it in one fell swoop. We'll just be sitting at dinner and out of fucking nowhere she says ""TJ, did Ashley..."" AAAAGH! If I thought it'd make things better, I'd no-so-kindly remind her that I didn't wanna talk about it. But it's not that easy.<br /><br />And you can always count on friends to make things easier, lemme tell ya. Lunchbox showed about as much sympathy as a fucking disgruntled traffic cop. His basic reaction was ""Now you know how I felt when you and Ashley were together after Manda and I broke up"". Thanks. Fuck you too Tony. And Hell, Meredith saw this time as appropriate to ask me to junior prom. I was cool in the beginning since she didn't know. But when she prodded further after I made it pretty clear it wasn't my thing, then I got a little irritated. I think at this point Ray's the only one with any kind of respect for my position.<br /><br />I'm trying to remember that in the grand scheme this is light compared to other stuff. There's stuff with my brother I'm not talking about even here. Plus cash is running kinda tight since the car up and died, hence my comment above about the eclipse/God's middle finger. <br /><br />On another note, Katrina and Shane split yesterday. Given that I'm not exactly speaking to either of them, this wouldn't be as big as you'd think. But it still seems to create a new definition of ""forever"", don't it?<br /><br />OK I think that's it. I'm just really disil-fucking-lusioned with the universe in general right now. Especially with school right now. I believe the count is around 62 days right now. Not soon enough. That's all I'm saying.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure the only good to come out of this week is that I got in touch with Lizzy last night. We might try to do something over spring break. That would be awesome-filled.<br /><br />OK now I'm done.<br /></div>
<br />I actually feel a little bit better now.<br /><br />Well, I do believe this just wasted most of a VHS period that I kinda needed to do work in since I'm going out tonight. But I really needed to vent a bit. The xanga may or may not be spared this vent. Haven't decided yet. Now to try to do some work...<br /><br />

Ain't that just beautiful?<br /><br />Luck for me it was the most un-serious entry I've done in awhile. Here's a short version, since I don't feel like remembering all I typed.<br /><br />Thanks to all the people who helped crazy-neurotic TJ this week...even the ones that did so and didn't know it...*SNEEZE<strong><sub>Ashley</sub></strong>SNEEZE*<br /><br />There was a Who song in a car commercial once upon a time.<br /><br />The Who &gt; The Doors<br /><br />Arguing with Lauren Patterson is funny as hell.<br /><br />Yeah that was about it. And now for a page out of Fanelli's book:<br /><br /><em><strong>Feel better Ashley...I love you so much...</strong></em><br /><br />==TJ=="

"event","...this is weird...<br /><br />...everything's pretty good, at least last time I checked it was...<br /><br /><br />...so why the hell do I have that doomsday feeling in my stomach? Last time that feeling came along I was a few hours removed from having my life turn to total shit for a few weeks.<br /><br />Someone do me a favor and smack me upside the head and tell me I'm being paranoid.<br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Unloading some baggage."">Alright, so the play ended. This past week has been the first week in awhile where I could actually feel human for a change. Also the first week where I could spend time with Ashley and all that goodness. How fitting that for the first three days of the week I go down with pink eye. Fan-fucking-tastic, right?<br /><br />Then there's whole job business. I know I need a job for any number of reasons, I'm not trying to deny that. It's all the things that come with getting a job. That extra step toward being a <em><strong>""real""</strong></em> adult. Y'know, after I typed that sentence i realized what's so wrong with that; I want all the good shit about being older, but without the downside of actually, y'know, being an adult. Its a crappy view of it, I know. But its what's going on in my head now.<br /><br />And now for an admission, something that I realized yesterday during a cathartic, surprisingly difficult conversation with my mom about this whole job bit. <strong>Change scares the bloody motherfucking HELL out of me.</strong> Before it wouldn't bother me so much. Just part of that whole ""natural progression of the universe"" kinda thing. But now there are any number of things that throw that out the window, not the least of those being Ashley, Ray, and all of them. I don't want all the things that have happened this year and all the things that will happen over the next six months to take down what I've tried so hard to build up. It means too much to me to have to give that all up. And part of me is afraid getting a job is the first step toward losing it.<br /><br />I guess this is the crappy part about being the oldest out of a group of friends.<br /><br />I guess ultimately my point to this is the same point I've made at least once in the past 6 months; my friends, all of them, are ridiculously invaluable to me, especially now that there's all this uncertainty circling me for the next six months. I can't do it alone. I need my friends to support me while I nosedive into the fiery pit. And I know sometimes I get caught up in other things, other people, all that stuff. But I don't want jobs, girlfriends, or anything else to get in the way of friends I wouldn't give up anything in the world for.<br /><br />OK. I actually think I feel better now.<br /></div>
<br /><br />OK, my loyal readers, I think that'll be all for now.<br /><br />==TJ==<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;3<br />&nbsp;Ashley"

TWICE!!!!<br /><br /></em></strong>Yeah, got acceptances Thursday from Aracdia (2d choice) and Penn-Delco (last choice). Still waiting for word from Drew (top choice), which in theory is coming sometime in March. Still though, 2 for 3's good stuff. Takes some of that pressure off. And as of 1:30PM Thursday, I want out if highschool. I've had it; get me THE HELL outta here! The only two things in this universe that make me REALLY wanna go to school are Ashley and the show, in that order (no offense to the cast of CoA). But yeah, that's the big stuff from this weekend.<br /><br />PS City of Angels opens Friday, runs Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and the following Friday and Saturday. <strong>YOU HAD BETTER BE THERE!!!<br /><br /><em>But It's You I Fell Into...<br /><br /></em></strong>==TJ==</font></p>"

</span><b>List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre,
whether they have words, or even if they're any good, but they must be
songs you're really enjoying now. Post these instructions in your
LiveJournal along with your seven songs. Then tag seven other people to
see what they're listening to! Bonus points if you give reasons for why they're you're favorites for the moment.<br>
<br>
</b>These are in no particular order:<br>
1. Audioslave - Doesn't Remind Me<br>
<br>
This is a bit of a departure from Audioslave's usual stuff. A fun,
catchy, even upbeat and happy rock number with a great chorus. And
c'mon, have you heard Tom Morello on that guitar solo? AWESOMENESS
MUCH??!!<br>
<br>
2. Avenged Sevenfold - Bat Country<br>
<br>
I had to warm up to this one a little bit. Avenged Sevenfold had all
the makings of a really weak, overproduced metal band. But after you
listen to Bat Country and sample some other stuff off <span style=""font-style: italic;"">City of Evil</span>,
you start to get a sense that they might be the kind of band to be the
Metallica for the next generation. They have an awesome blend of heavy
guitars and screaming vocals, and a smoother yet still heavy texture.<br>
<br>
3. Adam Pascal - Liken a Razor<br>
<br>
Yes, that Adam Pascal; the one who played Roger in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rent</span></span>.
He has two solo albums out, and this song is the first track off the
first of those albums. It's got sort of an STP feel in the guitars and
verses, but in the choruses it breaks into a Creed-esque rock
ballad-type thing (minus the Jesus Christ pose). Its available on
iTunes, and if you really need it I can burn it for you.<br>
<br>
4. 30 Seconds to Mars - Was it A Dream?<br>
<br>
In reality 30STM's entire second album, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">A Beautiful Lie</span></span>,
is on this list. But this song is so powerful. It's by far one of the
softest songs on the disc, but it carries so much more weight than the
rest of the CD. Jared Leto can do no wrong!<br>
<br>
5. James Blunt - You're Beautiful<br>
<br>
This man is awesome. Another British export making waves in the US. You
may have heard this song on 'Smallville' last week, and its been
floating around the charts in the area. A beautiful, acoustic ballad
that sucks you in from the opening chords. Commentary on Blunt's other
stuff is pending.<br>
<br>
6. Train - Meet Virginia<br>
<br>
Train had a hist before ""Drops of Jupiter""? What? C'mon, this song is a
radio classic! I don't really know what else to say, other than if you
don't know this song, you've probably been under a rock for about 6
years. <br>
<br>
(Last song to pick...always a pain in the ass...)<br>
<br>
7. The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony<br>
<br>
I first realized who/what this song was when Richard Ashcroft (lead
singer for The Verve) did this song with Coldplay at Live 8 in London.
It was an incredible performance, and it made me want to get the
original version. This is a wonderful song with an awesome string
accompaniment and addictively good background vocals (""It's just sex
and violence, melody and silence). I love this song.<br>
<br>
And I tag Ray, Lily, Lauren, Keeler, Lunchbox, Chrissy, and Matt Wright<br>"

"event","<P>I'd like introduce a new segment-thing that will frequent my 3 blogs (take this time to comment on TJ's lack of time and/or a life), entitled 'Scumbag of the Week'. In this segment&nbsp;I will introduce a person/group/organization that deserves to get kicked in the face, flipped off, or otherwise lambasted. We actually saw some examples of what it will look like on the xanga, where I went off on Joey Porter, Lars Ulrich, and the NBA front office. However, the official winner for this week is.........</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>...The ABC Network!</P>
<P>4&nbsp;Reasons why ABC gets this award: The NFL, 'Desperate Housewives', 'Lost', and 'Commander and Chief'. All&nbsp;four of these shows got my favorite show 'The West Wing' cancelled. C'MON!!! I&nbsp;had no beef with you people till your shows got all popular. I mean, yeah it was stupid of NBC to move 'West Wing' to Sunday nights, but look at this intellectually; which of the following is more stimulating: A well-written, powerful show about one of the most revered offices in America (written by the guy responsible for ""Sports Night"" and <EM><U>The American President</U></EM>, no less), or a respectably cast, addictive-like-crack (or so they say)&nbsp;dramedy about scummy people out to destroy one another? As I re-read that question, I realize just how much it could backfire on me, but still, it friggin' sucks. Damn it ABC, you weren't supposed to be any good after you put out that 'West Wing' knockoff crap 'Commander in Chief'. And to the people at NBC; don't think there won't be a massive write-in a la ""Family Guy"" and ""Star Trek"" over this. And I swear, if you put some dreck like ""My Name Is Earl"" in that 8PM Sunday slot, <STRONG><EM>there will be bloodshed. </EM></STRONG>But yeah, a nice big ol' middle finger to the scores of 'Housewives' watchers that knocked a perfectly wonderful show off the air</P>
<P>OK, so that's it for that one. Keep checking the blogs; I'm gonna rotate this across all 3 blogs, so as to make sure they all get used, and so that the various groups of readers all see who's getting slapped around in my mind.</P>

"event","I just love how my actual VHS class ended before Christmas, but my next one doesn't start till the 25th or something, so I can spend the next like two weeks doing whatever. In the case of today, 'whatever' looks like this.<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I don't know if you're reading this, or if reading this is completely unnecessary since you can see clear through me. I actually kinda hope you aren't reading this, since for you to pick up what I'm about to say from this rather than me actully, y'know, saying it would be all sorts of pathetic. I just need to put this down in some kind of cohesive order instead of it all just swirling around in this cluttered head of mine. I'm typing this on the fly, so just bear with me if I repeat myself or sound disorganized.<br><br>I've told you before I don't know how many times...you are incredible, amazing, awesome, all of that. And I mean every word of that. But it goes beyond just that. You hang out with Manda and ll her friends, but you're so much...I'unno, different, even better than them. I see you, and I can't help but just smile and think to myself 'Damn, and to think I was about to not go to that Christmas party...'. In the morning, my alarm clock goes off, and for the first time in what feels like forever I've actually looked forward to walking up to school, 'cause you'll be there. I know that sounds sappy as hell. But its true. I said I was nuts about you, and I am. You're beautiful, fun to be around, and you make going to lunch that much more fun. I don't think I could ask for anything to change about these past 3 weeks.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>...I love you...I don't know why it was so difficult for me to type that just now, but I do. Maybe its 'cause I've only known you a month or so and for me to have gotten to this point that quickly is a bit strange, but the fact remains that I do love you.<br><br><br><br>Y'know, I took all that time to build up to those two lines, and spent absolutely no time figuring out what to say after that. *laughs* There I go again, cracking jokes about myself when I have nothing better to say. So I'll just leave you, and let you know that that thing I told you I had to tell you but couldn't? Yeah I think I just did...unless of course you're not reading this...</span></span><br><br>==TJ==(...c'mon, do I really need to say &lt;3 Ashley, or did none of you read what I put there? Well, if you insist...)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;3<br>Ashley<br>"

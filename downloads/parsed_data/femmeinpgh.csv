"event","So....  I think I'm going to be voluntarily removing myself from the lives of my family.  My wonderful, sweet family, who I have always considered supportive, loving and caring.  The family that is supposed to have my back always.  The family that I always felt SOOO lucky to have, because they accepted my queerness... and always embraced my friends and lovers. 

Except they haven't.  And I was faced with that cold, harsh reality today.  G and I are supposed to go to my sister's house for thanksgiving.  We have G's niece... and need to drive her to Fresno on Wednesday... so, my master plan was to drive her home to fresno.. and then just keep heading to Sacramento and spend the night with my mom.  Ellie, G and I... spending the night with my mom.  Ok.  Shouldn't be a big deal.  

I was talking to my mom on facebook.. and I said... Hey, can G, Ellie and I spend the night on Wednesday so we can just be there on Thursday morning, instead of having to take that drive Thursday am?  Sure, she says.. I'd rather not have Ellie on my furniture.. and you and G have to sleep in separate rooms.  

Wait, what??  

I'm going to be 40 years old next year.  I'm a grown ass woman. But, I have to sleep in a separate room than the person I'm coupled with?  Are you fucking kidding me?

So, I say... are you serious?  Would you make Donna and Scott (my sister and Brotherinlaw) sleep apart?  

""Well, No"", she says...  ""they are married"".

Yes mom.. I know... but, I can't get married in the state of California.  

""Lets not get into this... lets just have a nice time.  You are more than welcome to stay"". 

Um??   Lets not get into this?? Lets not get into a conversation where you are faced with perpetuating the minimalization of my relationships and love?  I don't get enough of that in the world??? In society?? I have to deal with it in my own family????  Are you kidding me??

I am SOOOO angry.  I have been gone for 10 years... and only been back for two. I started thinking... maybe the reason they have been supportive is because, really, they haven't had to face it.  I came home for weekends at a time... spent time in hotels... before that, I was local, so never had to spend the night with anyone in my family.  And now... I'm bringing someone around more often... and they have to face seeing us hold hands, pecks on the cheeks, and god forbid, spend the night in the spare bedroom.

So, I have to make a decision...  Do I allow my family to reduce my relationship to a ""pal"" who hangs out in different bedrooms, just to keep the peace?  Or do I stand firm in my anger and say no... if you want to see me... you have to see ALL of me.  You don't get to pick and choose the parts of me you don't want to deal with.  It's all or nothing.

Looks like thanksgiving will be G, Ellie and I at home."

"event","I have a few &quot;REAL&quot; friends...  friends that I know would have my back no matter what...  those friends who I could call at 2am and ask for anything.... even if its just to sit on the other end of the phone and listen to me breathe because I was going through something.

I have a big handful of &quot;folks&quot;.  People I hang out with... really enjoy their company.  Laugh with, drink with... just generally chill with and have a great time.

My family loves me unconditionally.  Even when they don't agree with me. 

I also have a group of people who I wonder about.  People who claim to be &quot;friends&quot;, but they are the kind I need to wear kevlar with... the ones who grill me for information, and I wonder when they are going to use that information against me later.  Or if nothing else, I wonder if they are listening to me just to get their &quot;drama fix&quot;.    

I am working on eliminating that group of people from my life."

We went out to the little club in Long Beach.. it was pretty whack.... but, my Michael came out and hung out with us. &nbsp;I LOVE&nbsp;him. I miss him SOOOO&nbsp;much.&nbsp; It was so good to see him and just be in his energy.&nbsp; As soon as he saw me he said... &quot;geezis christina, how much weight have you lost since February???&nbsp; It's only about 18-20 pounds, but working out has really changed my body composition... so, it looks like more.&nbsp; He said... you look like you lost 30 pounds and then gained 5 more in your tits girl !!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was just so good to see him... and have him meet G and G meet him.&nbsp; I really need the important people in my life to know each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The club sucked... the music was pretty awful, but the three of us had a really nice time anyway.&nbsp; Saturday night was an amazing experience for me...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean...&nbsp;REALLY amazing.

I took a LONG&nbsp;time to get everything loaded into the truck.. and tied down... and the driv ehome was SLOOWWW.&nbsp;&nbsp;We didn't get back to the bay until about 1am... and now I'm beat..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to go home, get undressed... and just be in my bed for a few hours."

"event","I'm giving up.&nbsp; I'm going to stop trying to figure everything out. &nbsp;I had a great conversation yesterday with a friend that totally pissed me off.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't I stop trying to figure things out and just listen?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to just go with the flow... and enjoy the experience of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm broke.. yeah?&nbsp;&nbsp;So what?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still pay my mortgage and the bills... I&nbsp;just can't SHOP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to be thankful for the fact that I have a job and can actually pay a MORTGAGE. Not rent.. but, a mortgage on a house that is mine... that I&nbsp;can paint whatever color I want. &nbsp;That I can have dogs or cats in without paying a deposit... that I&nbsp;can have people over for a night or a lifetime without adding someone to a lease.&nbsp; It's my house.&nbsp; 

My friends make me crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;HAVE friends. &nbsp;I have people in my life who LOVE&nbsp;me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, for REAL love. &nbsp;The kind of people that would lay down their lives for me if it came to that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, they make me crazy....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they are worried about me... they have the raised eyebrow &quot;be careful&quot;&nbsp;look about them... and I&nbsp;need to accept that about them.&nbsp;They want what's best for me... and want me to know that they are there for me when I need them.&nbsp; In the interim...&nbsp; they are going to just step back and watch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love my friends.

My family... ohhhhh.. my family. &nbsp;The conversation with my sister the other day realllllly upset me.&nbsp; I was SOOOO disturbed by that... and couldn't understand where it was coming from.&nbsp; Is she really concerned for me?&nbsp;&nbsp;If she was, why would she suggest dating a MAN??&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, REALLY?? &nbsp;That is not the solution.&nbsp; Is she trying to pull me away from what I'm in now with G?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I overthinking this?&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it just be that she found comfort, stability and love in her marriage to a man... so, she thinks there is no other way to find those things?&nbsp;&nbsp; who knows.....&nbsp;&nbsp; but, she does love me. &nbsp;And she will be here for me long after other people have come in and out of my life. &nbsp;I&nbsp;need to respect that and cherish her for what she is.&nbsp; And, my beautiful 18 year old neice, who asked me about gender identification yesterday... and is going to take a gender studies class, because she wants to understand why G prefers to use &quot;he&quot; and &quot;Him&quot; instead of feminine pronouns.&nbsp; Like, she REALLY wants to understand.&nbsp; That is SO cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;knew they would be confused by all of this... and I'm SURE it will take time for them to get it... if they ever do. &nbsp;But, my beautiful Brianna wants to understand.&nbsp; That is amazing and awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love my family, no matter what.

And...&nbsp; G.&nbsp;&nbsp; ohhhh,&nbsp;G.&nbsp; I have learned so much about him before I&nbsp;even knew him.&nbsp; I got information from a lot of sources.. and... I appreciated every single tidbit of information I got.&nbsp;&nbsp;People were/are trying to protect me... and I have all of the information I got stored in the back of my brain so that I try to keep my head about myself.&nbsp; But, the bottom line is I love this person deeply.&nbsp; Does he love me as much?&nbsp;&nbsp;He says so...&nbsp; he tells me how he feels... and that he wants to build a life with me... and isn't that enough?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I HAVE to think about 1 year, 5, years, 10 years from now?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if this doesn't work?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if he cheats on me?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if he does to me what everyone has told me (including him) he has done to other women?................&nbsp; there are SOOO&nbsp;many what ifs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, today.... I&nbsp;love him... and I&nbsp;want to be with him.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I'm scared... but, I can no longer let that fear guide my decisions.&nbsp; I need to enjoy the experience for what it is.. today... and go from there.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If it ends tomorrow.... well, I had a couple of the best months in my entire life. &nbsp;Today, it is true, and it is joyous.&nbsp; Even if what people tell me is true... that what he says is just BS that he uses to get what he wants...&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting what I&nbsp;want too... so, should I care?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And... honestly, I don't think that's what is happening. &nbsp;I&nbsp;think he truly feels and believes what he says today. &nbsp;Is that a guaranty of tomorrow? &nbsp;Absolutely not.&nbsp;&nbsp; He could see some beautiful brown girl on the street tomorrow and forget all about me...&nbsp; and you know what?&nbsp;&nbsp;So could I.&nbsp; No relationship has a guaranty or an predetermined expiration date.&nbsp; A kiss and an I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;YOU is not a promise of forever.&nbsp; 

So.....&nbsp; with all of that, I'm letting go and going to enjoy my life.&nbsp;"

I get a few very kind comments from my friends, and an instant message from my sister &quot;Why did you just post that you are feeling empty on your page?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, I am in fact, feeling empty... I&nbsp;tell her.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, why do you want everyone to know that...&nbsp;I mean... why do you post stuff that is so SAD&nbsp;all the time?&quot;<br /><br />The conversation went downhill from there.... I told her that I just wasn't as HAPPY all the time like she was... I don't like in a 2 freakin million dollar house which is paid off... with horses in the backyard... and don't have the money to spend 20K a year to send my kid to private school.&nbsp;&nbsp; And buy a 4,000 bike to trail ride with... blah blah blah blah.&nbsp; My life just isn't that CHARMED.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />So, the next part of the conversation went like &nbsp;&quot;you know... maybe if you would date men... you wouldn't be so sad all the time!&nbsp; You date manly women anyway&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Wait, WHAT!????????????????&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been OUT since 1992..

"event","Ohhhhh... this dog is going to give me a heart attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

we were back in the ER last night.&nbsp; She was having major back pain... which was super weird, since she had MOUTH surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was crying and her back legs would give out when I tried to touch her back.

After 3 hours at the ER, xrays, and an enema... (yuck)... it was determined that she likely strained a muscle during or after surgery or... it could be nerve&nbsp;damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put her on&nbsp;a super steroid to get the inflamation around her muscles down... and gave her a narcotic to force her to sleep and stay off her feet.&nbsp; By the time I got her home.. she was WAYYYY loopy.&nbsp; Couldn't stand up without tilting over.&nbsp; Couldn't walk down the hall without running into a wall.&nbsp; I forced her to lay on the couch with me...&nbsp; and get some rest.&nbsp; Which she finally did.

this morning... I had to force her to wake up.. and when I did... we both realized she had urinated on herself without realizing it.&nbsp; I carried her into the bathroom and wiped her down... and put the couch cushion in the washing machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

She was having major pain in her back again.. but, was also not really capable of walking that well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't&nbsp; want to leave her home alone... and I had to go to work.&nbsp; I called the vet and described what was going on....&nbsp; and they agreed&nbsp;to do a medical monitoring of her today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By the time we got to the vet....&nbsp; she was in lots of pain in her back... and was whimpering.&nbsp; It was so sad.

They think she likely twisted her back and bruised her muscles.&nbsp;&nbsp; so now... she is on muscle relaxers and the&nbsp;steroid to keep the swelling&nbsp;down.

So.... after another&nbsp;$600.00 (combined with the $1200.00 I already spent)&nbsp;and a long&nbsp;night/day at the hospital.. she is home again.&nbsp; Sleeping on the blanket bed I made&nbsp;for her on the floor.

we are both exhausted...&nbsp;and I'm officially broke&nbsp;"

"event","Darcy was at the&nbsp; ER last night for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;

She was drooling really heavily... which by itself isn't enough to really cause concern, except that she just wasn't acting like herself. We went to the vet, and as it turned out, the drooling was just an upset tummy.

But...&nbsp; during the course of the exam, the doctor found a walnut size tumor under her gumline.&nbsp; Anyone who knows boxers, knows that they are notorious for cancer.... so, that was a huge cause for concern.&nbsp; They don't have the facilities for a biopsy at the ER, so I had to take her to the regular vet today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The regular vet actually found two tumors inside her gum line.&nbsp; One was bigger than the other and hid the second one.&nbsp; They were super hard... like little rocks, so they could not do a needle biospy, and they need to be removed.&nbsp;

So... she is scheduled for surgery on Monday at 8am.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I will hope that she is fine.. and that they are just little bits of nothingness....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However...&nbsp; I have to really hope that she wakes up from the anesthesia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anesthetic is super dangerous at her age.... but, we have no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked about giving her a strong sedative and a local.... but, because its in the mouth...&nbsp; a sedative won't relax her jaw enough to open her mouth at the level they need to.

So... she is scheduled for surgery....&nbsp; while, I, on the other hand.....&nbsp; am scheduled to cry repeatedly over the next three days.

I am so scared...&nbsp; and so incredibly sad."

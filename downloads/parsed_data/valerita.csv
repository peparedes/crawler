We're not 5, please stop acting like it. If you really do like me then just fucking tell me and stop dicking around. It's so annoying, it's not cute anymore.

so yeah. i'm in the same place i was last time i posted.
well. not entirely. 
with the whole boys situation: yes, nothing has changed. well, something might have changed, but he hasn't made a move yet and who knows if he ever will. the boy just needs balls.
with the whole friends situation: well that's a horse of a different color. i've pretty much completely changed my group of friends. of course, i still talk to my old friends, but not as much. it's a good thing. they like me more now, which is kinda weird, but they were never really normal. my new group is amazing. i get along with everyone (pretty much) and it's a party. they're just so much more like me. i'm kinda in the middle now, but closer to my new group of friends.... now i'm just confusing myself...

it's weird to be saying this, but for the first time in a VERY long time, i am truly happy. i'm completely content with my life. and i REALLY like it. sure, things could happen that would make me happier, but for now i'm good. =]"

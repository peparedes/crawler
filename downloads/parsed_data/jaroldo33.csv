"event","So i have been up for over 24 hours,or actually more now, but anyways...we just got back from a 24 hour tournament (that means that you play all night long) so we played a game at 2 at night, it sucked. But Cascade shocked everyone again! Even though no one comes to rep us up, we played good. Beat some teams we probably shouldnt have, and no one though we would, and by the end of the first day, we were sitting #1 seat in the harder bracket of teams. Thats really good for us. But ya, we went to sleep about 4:30 that morning, and woke up at 9 to play again. Thats a lot better than some teams because everyone else had to start playing at 6 so they got no sleep what so ever. But ya, we finally lost today to a team that was really good, actually, one player on that team was good, he beat us himself pretty much, so that sorta sucks but hey what are you gonna do? We finished 3rd overall out of 16 and went 4-1 on win loss ratio. Im really tired now, so i think i'll leave you now, so come rep us at our games at Eastmont, (for the schedual of games see Nora) cause we could really use your support. Peace out everyone, i'm sleeping!!!!!!!!"

"event","So i played a basketball tournament this weekend, and i found out... im pretty out of shape. Tennis just doesnt keep you in shape i guess, thats some fine print they dont tell you about when you sign up. Anyways... we did a whole lot better then anyone thought we would, everyone thought that Cascade would be out the first day, and then when we werent, everyone said we would be out the second day. Well we did get out the second day, but after we beat some really good teams and made it into the playoffs. Thats pretty big, a Cascade team in the playoffs... go figure. But ya, we lost to a team call Nuckquilla, of something like that. They had a 6 foot 7 guy!!! Thats huge! So ya we didnt do to bad i guess, we got 3rd in the tourny so we are all pertty happy."

"event","You know, work sucks, i suggest that you never get a job EVER! My day consisted of school, tennis practice, work, then after i got off at 11, i had to go home and do a 4 1/2 page reasearch paper for english class. Its actually my fault for not doing it ahead of time, but why blame it on myself when i can blame it on work? And my stupid teacher?"

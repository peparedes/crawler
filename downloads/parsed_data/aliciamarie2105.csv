"event","This is my tribute to the nice girls. To the nice girls who are overlooked, who become friends and nothing more, who spend hours fixating upon their looks and their personalities and their actions because it must be they that are doing something wrong. 

This is for the girls who don't give it up on the first date, who don't want to play mind games, who provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they've heard a thousand times. 

This is for the girls who understand that they aren't perfect and that the guys they're interested in aren't either, for the girls who flirt and laugh and worry and obsess over the slightest glance, whisper, touch, because somehow they are able to keep alive that hope that maybe... maybe this time he'll have understood. This is an homage to the girls who laugh loud and often, who are comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots, who care more than they should for guys who don't deserve their attention. 

This is for those girls who have been in the trenches, who have watched other girls time and time again fake up and make up and fuck up the guys in their lives without saying a word. 

This is for the girls who have been there from the beginning and have heard the rite words of advice, from ""there are plenty of fish in the sea,"" to ""time heals all wounds."" This is to honor those girls who know that guys are just as scared as they are, who know that they deserve better, who are seeking to find it.


This is for the girls who have never been in love, but know that it's an experience that they don't want to miss out on. For the girls who have sought a night with friends and been greeted by a night of catcalling, rude L0VESzs and explicit invitations that they'd rather not have experienced. 

This is for the girls who have spent their weekends sitting on the sidelines of a beer pong tournament or a case race, or playing Florence Nightingale for a vomiting guy friend or a comatose crush, who have received a drunk phone call just before dawn from someone who doesn't care enough to invite them over but is still willing to pass out in their bed. 

This is for the girls who have left sad song lyrics in their away messages, who have tried to make someone understand through a subliminally appealing profile, who have time and time again dropped their male friend hint after hint after hint only to watch him chase after the first blonde girl in a skirt. 

This is for the girls who have been told that they're too good or too smart or too pretty, who have been given compliments as a way of breaking off a relationship, who have ever been told they are only wanted as a friend.

This one's for the girls who you can take home to mom, but won't because it's easier to sleep with a whore than foster a relationship; this is for the girls who have been led on by words and kisses and touches, all of which were either only true for the moment, or never real to begin with. 

This is for the girls who have allowed a guy into their head and heart and bed, only to discover that he's just not ready, he's just not over her, he's just not looking to be tied down; this is for the girls who believe the excuses because it's easier to believe that it's not that they don't want you, it's that they don't want anyone. 

This is for the girls who have had their hearts broken and their hopes dashed by someone too cavalier to have cared in the first place; this is for the nights spent dissecting every word and syllable and inflection in his speech, for the nights when you've returned home alone, for the nights when you've seen from across the room him leaning a little too close, or standing a little too near, or talking a little too softly for the girl he's with to be a random hookup. 

This is for the girls who have endured party after party in his presence, finally having realized that it wasn't that he didn't want a relationship: it was that he didn't want you. I honor you for the night his dog died or his grandmother died or his little brother crashed his car and you held him, thinking that if you only comforted him just right, or said the right words, or rubbed his back in the right way then perhaps he'd realize what it was that he already had. This is for the night you realized that it would never happen, and the sunrise you saw the next morning after failing to sleep.


This is for the ""I really like you, so let's still be friends"" kiss after you read more into a situation than he ever intended; this is for never realizing that when you choose friends, you seldom choose those which make you cry yourself to sleep. This is for the hugs you've received from your female friends, for the nights they've reassured you that you are beautiful and intelligent and amazing and loyal and truly worthy of a great guy; this is for the despair you all felt as you sat in the aftermath of your tears, knowing that that night the only companionship you'd have was with a pillow and your teddy bear. 

This is for the girls who have been used and abused, who have endured what he was giving because at least he was giving something; this is for the stupidity of the nights we've believed that something was better than nothing, though his something was nothing we'd have ever wanted. 

This is for the girls who have been satisified with too little and who have learned never to expect anything more: for the girls who don't think that they deserve more, because they've been conditioned for so long to accept the scraps thrown to them by guys.


This is what I don't understand. Men sit and question and whine that girls are only attracted to the mean guys, the guys who berate them and belittle them and don't appreciate them and don't want them; who use them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest will be made. Men complain that they never meet nice girls, girls who are genuinely interested and compelling, who are intelligent and sweet and smart and beautiful; men despair that no good women want to share in their lives, that girls play mindgames, that girls love to keep them hanging. Yet, men, I ask you: were you to meet one of these genuinely interested, thrillingly compelling, interesting and intelligent and sweet and beautiful and smart girls, were you to give her your number and wait for her to call... and if you were to receive a call from her the next day and she, in her truthful, loyal, intelligent and straightforward nice girl fashion, were to tell you that she finds you intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend, would you or would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the ""stalker chick"" you'd met the night prior, who called you and wore her heart on her sleeve and told the truth? And would you, or would you not, refuse to make plans with her, speak with her, see her again, and once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once more for this ""nice girl"" who you just cannot seem to find? Because therein lies the truth, guys: we nice girls are everywhere. But you're not looking for a nice girl. You're not looking for someone genuinely interested in your intermural basketball game, or your anatomy midterm grade, or that argument you keep having with your father; you're looking for a quick fix, a night when you can pretend to have a connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the condom you were using during it.


So don't say you're on the lookout for nice girls, guys, when you pass us up on every step you take. Sometimes we go undercover; sometimes we go in disguise: sometimes when that girl in the low cut shirt or the too tight miniskirt won't answer your catcalls, sometimes you're looking at a nice girl in whore's clothing - - we might say we like the attention, we might blush and giggle and turn back to our friends, but we're all thinking the same thing: ""This isn't me. Tomorrow morning, I'll be wearing a teeshirt and flannel shorts, I'll have slept alone and I'll be making my hungover best friend breakfast. See through the disguise. See me."" You never do. Why? Because you only see the exterior, you only see the slutty girl who welcomes those advances. You don't want the nice girl.. so don't say you're looking for a relationship: relationships take time and energy and intent, three things we're willing to extend - - but in return, we're looking for compassion and loyalty and trust, three things you never seem willing to express. Maybe nice guys finish last, but in the race they're running they're chasing after the whores and the sluts and the easy-targets... the nice girls are waiting at the finish line with water and towels and a congradulatory hug (and yes, if she's a nice girl and she likes you, the sweatiness probably won't matter), hoping against hope that maybe you'll realize that they're the ones that you want at the end of that silly race.


So maybe it won't last forever. Maybe some of those guys in that race will turn in their running shoes and make their way to the concession stand where we're waiting; however, until that happens, we still have each other, that silly race to watch, and all the chocolate we can eat (because what's a concession stand at a race without some chocolate?)"

"event","""Blue Chair"" 
There's a blue rocking chair
Sitting in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands
It sways back and forth
With the help of the winds
It seems to always be there, like an old trusted friend.

Chorus:
I've read a lot of books, wrote a few songs
Looked at my life - where it's goin', where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield
But nothing compares to the way that I see it
To the way that I see it, to the way that I see it
When I sit in that old blue chair.

From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail in and out of Cinnamon Bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
Prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start.

Chorus:
I've read a lot of books, wrote a few songs
Looked at my life - where it's goin', where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield
But nothing compares to the way that I see it
To the way that I see it, to the way that I see it
When I sit in that old blue chair.

That chair was my bed one New Year's night
When I passed out from too much Malibu and diet
And I woke up to a hundred mosquito bites
I swear, got 'em all sitting right there
In that old blue chair.

There's a blue rocking chair
Sitting in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands...

""On the Coast of somewhere Beautiful..."" 
i knew i could never hold that girl
she was born to see the world 
all i got is a picture she mailed me
barefoot in the snowwhite sand
bag of seashells in her hand
she finally found a paradise it seems

*chorus*
on the coast of somewhere beautiful
tradewinds blowin through her hair
sunlight dancin on the water
and i wish i was there
dont know how im gonna find her
and all i know so far
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful 
runnin with my heart

sometimes when the sun goes down
shadows fall across this little town
and i close my eyes and i drift away...
to another place and another time
when the world was ours and she was mine
i dream of holdin her again some day

*chorus*
on the coast of somewhere beautiful
tradewinds blowing through her hair
sunlight dancin on the water
and i wish i was there
dont know how im gonna find her
and all i know so far
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful 
runnin with my heart

dont know how im gonna find her
and all i know so far
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful 
runnin with my heart

oh 
shes runnin
with my heart
on the coast of somewhere beautiful.."

I dont really like doing this whole online journal thing anymore... i dunno.. it kinda seems like a waste of time for me now. I have to many things to do. I sometimes update my xanga but thats only when i have a lot of fun. 

I miss florida a lot i guess. The people were nice. I miss how i had nothing to do down there but i was still having fun. Its like i was with 3 other girls and some guys we met down there, we didnt really all know each other ""that"" well but we had the time of our lives. But then i get back up here with everyone i know and my days just seem to drag on. I think its because of school. My weekends have rocked... but my weekdays suck ass! 

I have to get a prom dress. If anyone has old ones that would fit me let me know. I dont want any really skinny chick on here saying.. ""oh i have one for you"" when they know my fat ass wouldnt fit in it. I will be highly annoyed if this happeneds. 

Schools almost out and im scared and happy at the same time. Im 18 year old, single, and happy right now. I love it. 

SENIORS WHAT.. 05' baby - that reminds me of Devon! I love her. We're going to Ferris on Friday! I cant wait.

"event","This weekend was sooo fun! You dont even know..

Friday

Adam called me and then i went over to his appartment and hung out with him and hes room mate Chris! They were playing Halo 2 and we were all just having a good time. He has the fattest cat i have ever seen in my entire life! It is huge! His name is Chubb Chubb. Its soo cute! Then we all went to see White noise. I liked it, minus the ending, that was kinda bad. It made me jump a few times tho. Then we went to go get some food and then we went back to his appartment/townhouse. And just watched the Jamie Kenendy show. It was fun.

Saturday

I went to work at like 10 and then me and Ashley went to Detroit! It was a lot of fun. My friend Chris's band was playing. (not the chris from the night before) The bands called The Summer Formal, and they're really really good. I couldnt belive it. There was a band called Finius there and they were sweet too. Ashley got us lost a little bit.. lol and it was funny, i was gettin so mad.. im such a loser.. but its all good.  We had to pay like fucking $12 to park! i was like holy shit! But it was worth it. We got to hang out with the band and stuff. And Ashley fell in love with the singer Nick. I have to admit he is way hot. He wears girls pants, and thats just hott! I wanted to stay and party with them but by that time we werent going to get home until like 1 anyway so we just left. On the way home we listened to my old Jonesday tape! It brought back so many old memories. It was a good time. It was so funny to watch Ashley get that excited. It was good times

Sunday

I woke up early and me and Denny went to meet up with Paw, Josh, and Chachie! And we all went Detroit ( yea it was that kind of weekend) to check out the Auto show. I had the best time. They make me laugh so hard its rediculus. I was acting like i was from Manchester England the entire time and people believed me. Two guys asked me where i was from and Denny had to walk away  because he was laughing so hard. I swear i havent laughed as much ive laughed this weekend is so long i cant even remember. But then we all came back, and we were taking pictures in the car. I'll post them when Denny gives them to me! They are soo funny! But then we went to get bubble tea in EL. It was so funny. I guess you had to be there but thats going in my memory book forever as one of the best times of my life. No joke. Then i got home and it wasnt good. Me and my mom kind of bonded and we got stuff sorted out. But im really worried about her. Ive been praying all day for her. She needs it. So even if you dont believe in  God, will you please pray for her. I would really appriciate it. 

Monday

I was supposed to go to this MLK day thing, which i was really interested in. But the events from the night before got me down a little bit, so i didnt end up going. I got all my laundry and stuff done, so i guess thats a good thing. Today was kind of just a chill day. It was nice. Im really thankful for the things that Martin Luther King Jr. did for all of us. He really was a great man and he will live forever through the people hes touched. Its really amamzing. Ive been thinking about this stuff lately. I want to be known forever for doing something great. Like in my Western Civ class we were talking about Socrates and Alexandar the Great, and they lived soo long ago, and yet we still hear and learn about them. I want that. Maybe someday ill have that. 

well as for the rest of the week, i really dont have any plans. I have to study for finals but thats it, oh and I have to study for my ACT's. I know I know.. im a loser for not taking them before. I just thought I was going to go to LCC, but now that im going to Ferris i need them, so im taking them. Better late then never right.. well thats all, im kinda burned out. Hope you all have a good night. And dont forget to pray for my mom! Thank you.

Introduce her  to your friends as ""The most amazing girl I know''. Sit in the park and talk to her.  Take her to the library, ice skating, playgrounds, and coffee shops. Tell her stupid jokes... Whatever it takes to make her laugh. Write poems about her. Walk with her, even if its just around the block. Throw pebbles at her window at night. SURPRISE HER. Do things that make her SMILE, make her LAUGH, and make her want to KISS you right on the face. BE SPONTANEOUS.. When she starts yelling at you, tell her you love her. Give her back rubs. Play football with her. Let her fall asleep in your arms. Call her even if its just to say hi. Call her back if she calls you. Jump on the bed with her.  Whisper in her ear. Sing to her, no matter how bad you are. Carve your names into a tree. Get her mad, then KISS her. Push her on swings. Stay up with her all night. Leave her little unexpected notes.. on the car, or on her door, saying how much she means to you. Take her to romantic places and lay out blankets to look at the *stars*. Make up nicknames for each other. Show up at her work or apartment unexpectedly. Send flowers and dorky notes that only you two understand. Teach her guitar. Lend her your cds. Make her cds of songs that remind you of her. Write her letters. If she asks you to go to a show with her, go, even if it means a 5 hour car trip. Go on a road trip even if theres no destination or you cant be gone long. Listen to her favorite songs. When shes sad or sick, hang out with her or stay on the phone with her, even if shes not saying anything.  Buy her ice cream. Let her take all the pictures of you SHE WANTS. Look into her eyes. Slow dance with her, even if the music is fast. Make her a romantic dinner for special days. Remember dates.. even ones like your first kiss or date and surprise her on the anniversary. Kiss her in the rain. Kiss her when she least expects it"

"event","I dont know what makes me do the things i do. I dont think about things before i do them... i think about it after... Why cant i just be one of the guys! lol not litteraly.. but why cant i just hang out with people anymore... i dont understand how life got to be this complicated.. 

I truely wouldnt change a lot of things in my life because its those situations that have made me into the person that i am.. even if i dont like my self that much at times. But i realized that everyone hates them self at one point or another. I am no different. There are some lustful relationships that i would take back, I know i hurt people, but for some reason or another at that point in time i didnt care. And now i look back and im shocked at how i acted. Im sorry to those who have felt that from me. I never really ment to do the things i have done.. and i hope one day you'll realize that your a much better person not with me... rather then with me. 

I am a strong person. And i think thats what makes people want to be around me.. and at other times it makes them hate me. I understand that. But sometimes I need to realize that my actions speek louder then words.. and how i treat people needs to change. i hold hate in my heart for too long and i need God to help me get rid of it. But maybe im waiting too long and looking up to much... maybe i need to do things on my own for a little bit. You know i havent really ever gone that long with out a relationship... I think its because for some reason or another i need to feel loved.. and i dont mean friendship love.. i just mean love. Real love. And ive never really had that.. besides one person who i think, thinks he loves me... But in all acutuallity he doesnt. Havent you ever be so in love with someone.. so blinded by it.. because you think its so wonderful, then you have a fight and break up or just stop talking and realize that the person that you were with, wasnt really the person you knew. That they did all these bad things. But you just didnt see their faults because you were blinded. 

I dont want to be blinded by lust anymore... Im 17 years old. I have a lot of happiness thats is a head for me. And i just want to be me for a little bit.. If i have to find out who i am alone.. then thats what i need to do. I need to find God agian. Its so funny, that i never give credit to the big man when things are going good... but when times are bad all i can do is blame him. Its not his fault.. he gave me free will... and now i need to take it back.. 


I really am happy. Yes there are things in my life that i need to change to make me a better person, and friends i need to keep and friends i need to get rid of.. it seems like all my hate and hostility comes from wanting to be someone im not.. or to be around people that might not give me what i need. 
I just need to realize that everything will be ok in the end.. and if its not ok.. then its not the end... and i need to realize that no one is perfect.. that people are just like me.. people who forget to call friends.. even when they need them.. and people who make mistakes and say things that they shouldnt.. i need to become a better person.. and i will... so dont worry about me.. God will take care of me.. I think everyone needs to find out who they are, and what they need, before trying to help someone else...


I love you.."

Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets.
This is not a small cut that scabs, and dries, and flakes, and heals.
And I am not afraid to die.
I'm not afraid to bleed, and fuck, and fight.
I want the pain of payment.
What's left, but a section of pigmy size cuts.
Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks.
Would you be my little cut?
Would you be my thousand fucks?
And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid.
To fill, and spill over, and under my thoughts.
My sad, sorry, selfish cry out to the cutter.
I'm cutting trying to picture your black broken heart.

Everyone ive ever known is here or around here and it scares me that i could move off to college and never see some of you ever again. Im sorry for the things ive done and and said. It makes me sad to think that the bonds im making with people now could be broken in less then a year. 
I take to many people for granted. I just keep thinking about the people that I've lost in my life... Every single person took those people for granted... every single one.. and now look.. Ill never be able to hold my grandmas hand again.. or walk out to the car and warm it up for her.. Ill never get those tiny things that i miss so much.. back. <b>EVER</b>..  And if you think about it.. every single one of us are going to die.. at some point.. it happens.. its natural.. It could be tomorrow and i dont want to leave this earth knowning that i didnt try to fix things. So im sorry... Im sorry to everyone.

Everyone has told me just to go to LCC, which for me is just fine. Because its closer to home and its a hell of a lot cheaper.. But then this finanical aid guy came in today and told me  Ferris can be just as cheap! So i was really excited. And in 2nd hour Jerry told me he got in, and so did Nick and Brice, and Toms  getting in too! SO CONGRATS GUYS!! But now I'm really excited, Ive grown up with these guys so it will be fun to know some people there if I go. AHH Im SO HAPPY. I hope i get it! I really do! But anyway.. if all else fails I will be @ LCC! So no matter what.. I win! Ahh i just get freaked out because you have to fill out all these forms and do all this other crap.. Plus i have to do the ACT's gowwd... Its alright though.. 

The last couple of weeks have been fun, Found a boy.. and hes a good one! Finnally! Hung out with cool people... and some not so cool people. MY HARMONA turned the big 2-1!!! And me and Annie went to Rickys house and hung out with them! It was a blast... I beat the hell out of matt and Zoran.. and we held down ZO and put a Hitler stash on him! B/C hes from Germany/Crotia. I love those boys... Were all going to Silver Bells in the City on Friday. IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO GO.. TALK TO ME AND YOU VERY MUCH ARE INVITED! SO if DUFFY, HANNAH, PAIGE, DEVON, RACHAEL, ANNIE, ANYONE! Brookes all ready going i think.. and i dont know if Tosha can.. 

My grades have been pissing me off.. Alright im reallly smart and i know what im talking about.. BUT.. my grades dont reflect that. So i was failing a class and people got on my ass about it! But this week has been good.. Ive been doing all my shit that i needed to get done. and hopefully it starts a trend...

I have to say My heart goes out to My Annie! I love you hun and so did your grandma.. Hang in there.. Everything will be ok! if you need me im only down the street of a phone call away****************

"event","So i went to see saw on Halloween. I thought it was soo much better then the Grudge. I like movies like that... 
This week has been soo disappointing. For one thing. Bush won. I wanted to shoot my self. I hate him more then anyone. I'm not going to get into it because anyone who knows me.. knows why i hate him. I think ive done my share of shoving why down people throats. Me and a bunch of people are wearing black arm bands, for a silent protest. Me and brooke got ours last night. Oh and this girl came in to my work last night and told me proposal 2 was voted yes. I had the worst feeling. What i dont think people realize is its not just about  homosexuals. They don't understand straight people are effected to. Ok for example if my friend and her boyfriend have been dating for like 6 years or something. If he goes in a coma.. because of proposal 2 she has NO say in what happens to him. None.. Not even if his only family was a dad that was a crack addict. The fucked up parent has a say, but the best friend and girlfriend... who has supported him and love him and been with him, wouldnt have a fucking word in edge wise. I hate people who only see one side of things and then vote for something all their friends vote for. It shows you how well educated we are here in America. Wow..

Now that thats over... I cant wait to go to college. Yes I love high school because its so routine but im alright with change. I think i can handle it. Plus i want to met so many people! God its going to be amazing. I love the good friends i have. i thank god everyday that i have them in my life. But some people i can just live with out... Like the type of friends that sit there and talk shit behind your back right after you leave the room. Its sad how immature and annoying these friends are.. and yet i still try.. hoping that one day they will grow out of it... or hoping that they see how much they've fucked up. Yes ive done some pretty hurtful things to people. I know that and im sorry. But ive tried being nice and ive tried being friends. But a relationship takes effort on both parties parts, not just mine... 


My mom went to my conference's, and i guess all my teachers like me. Mr. Harmon even. I thought he hated me, But i guess he said that i was one of the strongest, most out spoken female students he has ever known. I was so happy to hear that last night. People make suck a big impact on my life. And sometimes i dont even know it. All my teachers say i should be getting better grades. Ok i know im smart, i just hate doing homework. Plain and simple. I hate it. Exspecially when i have work and friends and family i have to deal with when i get home. Its hard.. But hey whatever i guess i have to just buckle down and get it done. 

I have to go get ready for the day.. Catch ya on the flip side..."

"event","Its been soo long since ive done this... I guess its because i dont really have a lot of free time anymore, just to sit down and let someone that i probably dont know read about my life. My life isn't very exciting anyway. All i ever do is just hang out with friends and go see movies and go out to eat and junk like that. Oh an i work. 2 times a week.. But i have no problem with that. I really do enjoy where i work. And i love everyone that i work with! GLEN in my fav. though. We get along soo well.. Its crazy! But anyway. Schools been good. I feel like im swamped though. I have like 4 projects in econ, a couple in western civ. one in Sociology and one in my film class. Plus i have to do work for a class im taking next semester. Its going to take me a lot of self control not to freak out about it. because on top of that I do have to work, I go to chruch, i have test and quizes, and homework and i have to blance my social like and my family time. Sometimes it can be overwhelming. 

These last couple of weekends have be awesome. Ive met a lot of way cool people. Like Mike, Alex, Eric, Joe (not the freak) and Tim. Those are baiscally the guys i hang out with. Sometimes theres a few more but who really cares. I think i feel more comfortable around guy. They are just so easy to get along with. Girls create Drama. I'm am so far gone from that its unreal. I do hang out with some girls though. Mostly Brooke and Tosha. They are super fun. Isnt crazy that you can have so many friends in school, People that you talk to everyday and can have the best conversations with. But you will never hang out with them out side of school. Maybe once in a blue moon you will but most of the time you dont. Me and Devon were talking about that. I love her so much. shes one of those people, i can talk to for hours and we can have so much in common... but for some reason or a nother.. We dont hang out. I think its just because when you hang out with a certain group of people and you have fun with those people you make plans for the next night or the next weekend.. and you really never think about inviting anyone else. Even though it would probably be so mcuh fun to have them over.. you just dont... Its kinda crazy. 

I got the new The Used CD and i must say, Its very good. I really like it a lot. I browed the Hawthorne Heights CD from Derek and there are some really good one liners on that one. Like..

""Sit back and let her die slowly,
Dont cry
She didnt love you anyway"" 

Wow i think that applies to some people now a days. I would hate to sit there and have a relationship with some one for so long and then break up.. I would feel like my time was wasted.. But i know some people dont think like that. I suck.. I know..

I have a doctors appt. on wednessday... Im scared.. 

Thats about all maybe ill have to do this again someday!

But of corse i still have my old friends. I love them. Speeking of old friends, Cortney left me. :( Im very sad... Its alright though because I talk to her all the time. Plus im going to see her on the 15th i think! its gonna be awesome. She goes to Kent state. And guess what?!?!? I might go there with her. I kinda want to look at western and Grand Valley. Maybe ill have to take some college days here soon. 

Me and Brooke have become very close again. I have to say i really like it. I really missed her and that fight was probably on the dumbest things ever. But we've become closer then ever! For some reason we always end up hanging out.. then going to target.. its our place. I think its funny. im Proud of you Brooke.. and you know why! 

Me and Zoran arent really friends anymore.. and it sucks because i really really miss him. I just miss being around him and being able to just go over to his house and play on the computer or watch T.V or playing poker with him. But i guess he said some pretty bad stuff about me.. and i dont think i can be friends with someone like that... Even if it hurts this much, Just seeing him in the halls kill me. :( 

Annie and I will always be friends.. Ive just noticed that.. I know im stupid for not realizing it earlier. I Think about it and we've been friends for 12 years.. Not many people can say they've had the same bestfriend for 12 years.. Its amazing! 

Oh OH the other day me and Ash went to target and got a camra and a Lunch box! oh yes it was fun!

Aries - Your Love Profile


Your positive traits: 

You're quite the charmer. You've got the wit and attitude to attract almost anyone you meet.
Out spoken and honest, any date knows how they stand with you.
Fearless, independent, and willing to try anything twice - your dates should expect the unexpected. 

Your negative traits: 

You tend to be vain, and you expect your partner to feed that vanity often with complements.
Hot tempered and impulsive, you've occasionally ended things ... only to reget it later.
You're obsessed with being the best, most loved girlfriend or boyfriend your sweetie's ever had. 

Your ideal partner: 

A risk taking, free spirit like yourself - who can keep up with your latest wild child antics.
Someone stylish, attractive, and fit... who can keep you attracted for months.
Is hard to get - and lets you pursue things. You prefer to be the chaser, not the one being chased. 

Your dating style: 

Wild, unpredictable, fun, and daring. Your ideal date may involve a couple motorcycles or naked skydiving. 

Your seduction style: 

Honest and direct - you have no need for romance or much foreplay.
Show off. You like to show your lover how you're the best ever.
Ambitious. You often like to go all night - or aim for multiple orgasms. 

Tips for the future: 

Start to believe in second and third chances. You don't have to dump them so fast.
Savor the process. Sometimes the best part of falling in love is taking things in slow motion.
Let go of comparisons. If someone's with you, then you've already one. Stop worrying about exes."

"event","If you think about it.. Everyone makes choices in their lives. Whether it be good or bad.. 

Im not saying that they deserve to die or even get in a crash that night.. But they made the choice to drink and drive, Knowing that something bad could happen. Everyone knows that when you drink and drive you can get hurt or hurt others.. But they did it anyway. I wish that they thought about it before stepping in that car.. But they didnt.. and now they have to live with the choices they made.. 

Its just sad that someone had to die.. I Feel sorry for them and for the families. Because the choices that they made today.. are the regrets they have to live with tomorrow.. 

I hope that they ones who lived.. learned. I know that sounds cliche but its true..

Whats the point of going through school and meeting some of the best people in the world.. and then one night you drink.. for whatever reason.. and step into a car and die... without knowing what you could be or what you could have done.. it just seems like a waste of time..  

We've lost to many people this way. Doesnt it just seem easier to not drive.. I know people are going to drink or whatever and do what they want.. But just dont drive if your going to do it. Stay at the place where you are drinking.. Because the next time you step in to a car after drinking.. you could kill your self.. or even your best friend.."

Friends=good
work=good
family=good.. 
life=fine


Life gets Lonley  but the funny thing is.. I'm never alone.. its crazy.. 


Courtney leaves at the end of August.. its gonna be sad..:( were going to see her though!  

Ok heres some theroy's 

Telling the truth isnt always good.. but lying isnt always bad, if telling the truth makes some one feel bad.. then lying can be good, Good things can come from lying.. but bad things can come from telling the truth although.. sometimes only telling part of the truth is the same things as telling a lie.. i have no idea if thats good or bad.. 


I have a theroy about parents.. they want you to appreate the good things in life.. but not do them, they want you to have love, and value love, and recive love.. but not make love... they say do as i say not as i do.. whats up with that??


Why cant people ever say what they really feel?? I think if everyone just said how they really felt about a situation.. there would be a lot less fights... but maybe their would be more.. but maybe.. if from the begging people did that.. there would be less... who knows.. more people would be hooking up though.. oh skeet.. 

off to bed i go.. good night! 

Just think about those things.. crazy.."

I love my friends dont get me wrong. And their are a lot of lies being spread about them.. and it needs to stop! People assume wayy to much.. and im sick of it. 

I am NOT a bad person for making a mistake.. i didnt do anything bad.. i just did something stupid.. and im telling you right now.. its not happening again.. so if you dont want to be someones friend because they made a mistake.. then your really not going to have any friends.. b/c NO ONE is perfect.. and if you think you are.. then your freaking nuts!"

"event","<center> soo yesterday had its boring parts, but for most of it, it was fun. Hannah and her little sister came over. And we played in the pool and layed in the sun. We went inside and we ate 3 pizza.. they were the frozen kind.. yum! Then we watched a movie.. and my living room has some awesome movie thearter qualities! lol.. meaning it gets really dark.. and kinda cold like a movie theater.. :) 

A little later the one and only Ashley came over.. and i swear to god.. she is SUCH a PHONE-A-FOBE.. if you know what i mean.. (i know i cant spell but hey .. whateva..) She doesnt call anyone, unless its like us girls.. but its so funny to watch her try to call some one, then chicken out! She even lied and told me she called someone.. but she didnt.. its soo funny.. but then we called jake.. and he didnt pick up.. so we called Andrew Ash.. and i guess he wants to go see a movie with us tonight.. but who knows with that kid.. But then We went to pick up Annie and went to get ice cream.. But Ashleys tasted like straight up ASS! So we went to a nother ice cream place and got a new one.. :0) 

I love the park.. its peaceful. Me and Annie and Ashley went to one and sat up on the lifegard stand.. Its cool being way up there and being able to see all around the piss hole that they call a pond. It was uber ( as ashley likes to say) KALT lol (cold in German) so we went to annies and grabed the Dane Cook DVD and a borad game. We didnt end up watching or playing either of them. We played the DVD viersion of my T.P. And it was nice just playing a game and eating food with those girls.. I dunno what i would do without them.. Probably nothing. Oh ya .. we called you too aubri.. but you cant ever hear your phone right.. bia.. no i still love you! 

TONIGHT: I'm going to get myself ready. Me and Cindy are going to see HARRY POTTER. ANd then after ASHLEY gets outta work.. me and her and MAYBE ANDREW... and some of his friends.. are going to see a movie.. maybe.. if he ever gets the balls to call us! lol j/k.. i do really miss him..

"event","Ok.. So i Havent updated for a while.. But its because my computers messed up! But here it goes.. Since I've gotten back from florida I've had the best time. Wednesday plans got kinda messed up but it ended up being fun! I hung out with Ashley, Rachael, Derek, Jake, and Ben for a little while. It was fun becuase i havent hung out with those boys in sooo long.. It was a good time. I chased Dereks dog around... haha im funny. 
Thursday Erica V. Got here.. I didnt really get to talk to her much so i dont really know anything about her.. But i Had the best time at rachaels bonfire. I hung out with Aburi, Annie, Ashley, Rachael, Kelli, Jerrid, Tony, and this kid named Chad. I mean there was a lot of people there but those are the ones i mainly talked to... Oh ya.. Aburi Proposed to me.. it was AMAZING, We're married now. Umm and that was it for thursday, Friday i had to go to work at like 10 in the morning.. i know boo hoo, but it was earily. Ashley came up after and we bought her stuff and me a pair of comfy pants. Then we met up at paiges house... but she wasnt done babysitting so we went to the park and all met up there.. we went to walk in the Rely for Life thing. It was the coolest thing. We were the 101 Dalmations or whatever. And we won the tent thing, The theme was Dinsey if you didnt catch that one. It was Me, Ashley, Paige, Brandon, and Steve. It was a blast. Everyone minus Ashley who was playing Cards with brandons family, walked at midnight, for an hour, and im telling you in flip flops thats a killer. But we all went to brandons and got in the hot tub. And me and ashley and steve had a gigglefest 2004! it was sooooo much fun, Were doing that again! we were all squshed on a fold out bed! oh yes.. it got a little cozy! me and ashley totally spooned.. lol j/k. I only got 45 minutes of sleep and i had to work at 10 again the next day. But it was all good. Saturday night me and ashley hung out with this kid Glen, jeff, Tom and Denny. It was fun, We met up at Damons at like 11:30 with her sister and heather and lindsay. It was a blast. I lost at triva. too bad. Then last night me and Ashley again hung out.. then ABURI came over! and we went to get people food and went to the TH. Which was my first time and i gotta say, that place is soo dirty.

"event","Me and someone else got in a really big fight.. we have never faught like that. It was a whole bunch of talking about what the other person has done wrong. I always blame other people for my problems. And I know I bring a lot of the drama in to our groups. But I never intend to do that. We all have our problems.. but sometimes I feel like all the fingers are pointing in my direction, because im an easy target. Nobody can say that they are drama free all the time.. and I usally have at least one thing that is going on. And some people have asked me why I dont talk about my problems with people. And why I only let a select few in to ""my"" world. Well I am going to put it all out there...

I DO NOT trust people. Some of it is my past but most of it, is what people are doing right now. I feel like NO one ever see's the good I've done for people. And they dont see that really I try to be a good person. I really do care about my friends! With my whole heart. I love each and everyone of you for who you are.. and i dont usually judge what bad ive seen in you. But I feel like there is ALWAYS someone mad at me.. for whatever reason there is. I know I have said and done some pretty stupid shit in my day. But DO NOT hold that aginst me now. I am totally different then I was one year ago.. Just like ADULF said in her journal. Im growing up. Im going to make friends along the way. Some people will not like me.. and i know that.. I know I can be a bitch. But maybe I'm just blunt. I say whats on my mind. So you always know what I think of you.. Or of what you say. I know a lot of people arent really used to it but i have always been this way. WHY ARE PEOPLE ACTING LIKE ITS A NEW THING???? 

Someone once told a friend of mine that the reason he liked me so much was because I dont like people walk all over me and he thought i could keep him in check. And I do, do that. But why does this person care so much what I think? And then when I do say what I think.. They get all pissed off.. I dont understand. I know its not what you say.. its now you say it. I know that i say it in hurtful ways. But if this person really thought we were friends then, I would think, they would know i never tried to hurt them like that. And sometimes i say things that i think.. before thinking about if its going to hurt that person. Im sorry if i hurt you. And I hope you do know I care about you. 

Sometimes I feel like im at the edge of a cliff and my friends are on the other side just trying to push me off. None of my friends know i feel like that.. Becaues i dont want to hurt them. And its not everytime we hang out.. its only like once in a while.. But... When it happens its usally when everyone starts attacking me. And ive talked to some of my friends about this.. so i dont want them to think im keeping it going.. just some of the other people need to read this. 

I put up my walls because I have to.. or I'll have nothing to protect my self with. 

The only thing holding you back from your future.. is you past.  So let it go. 

And the only reason I put that in there is because i need to live by that.. 

Sometimes i want to move away from everyone and go to a place where NO ONE knows who i am .. so i can start over. I know i cant do that.. So i rather just start over Here. 

Hi my names Alicia Kyte 
I live in Holt. It can be the best town and the worse at the same time. 
I know some of the best people in the world they mean the world to me. 
Im 17 years old and I have never been in love... Only because I do not allow my self to get hurt. 
I drive the Blue Love Machine... Its my baby! 
Im going to be a senior next year. My last year... and I cant wait until I hear 
""I would like to congradulate the graduating class of 2005!"" 
Oh ya.. and I love ITALY!!! 

That is all.."

"event","Alright a lot of people have been discussing Gays. Everyone has an opinion. Just because some one doesnt think the way you do doesnt mean that person is a bad person. And if Annie backs up her story with evidence that she thinks is right that doesnt make her a bad person ether. I think its easier sometimes for people to point their fingers at people who are different from them. Maybe because the person who is pointing the finger is the one with the insecurities. 
    I personally think that gay people <b> should </b> be able to get married. They are people too and people deserve to be happy!  Just because they are gay doesnt make them a bad person either. That is ONE thing about that person. Its NOT WHO they are. You can not help who you fall in love with. I honestly can say that i believe that gay people are born gay. Because every gay person i have ever met has told me that they have known that they were gay since they can remember. ANd I dont care how many studies you show me saying that it is something chemically wrong with them, I will not believe it. 
  If this is a country where everyone is free to practice what ever religion they want to, but with out killing anything or hurting anyone, then why cant gays get married? Who are they hurting? 
   50 years ago it was not right for races to mix. We now look back and say how stupid that was. In 10 years we are going to look back and say how stupid it was for people not to let Gays get married. This problem is NOT going to go away. So why not let people who love each other get married? What if the government suddenly said that you and the person that you loved could not get married... You would fight it til death do you part.... 
In order for people to understand, something has got to happen.. Just like the Civil Rights movement.. Protest started, And protest have started now. I just rather be on the side of people who want people to be happy.. Not the ones who try to hold someone back from being happy because they dont agree with something (that has NOTHING to do with them) about a person...

These are my thoughts.. Love them or Hate them.. But they are my own.. NOT yours."

We knew he had a plan, so we went over there early to watch him. And Mr. Conner was over there and they were going to get us. SO we waited until Mr. Conner left and Mr. K went to bed. ANd then we hit! It was amazing. We wraped the TP around his whole house! We had it every where.. It could have been better but we only had 12 rolls. We went back to record it, with brandon and Rob. And Rob and Rachael went and tried to get his car again. Just messing around. Then he caught them. But it was the 2nd time we had been there so it didnt count. And i wasnt doing it so it was all good. But Rachael and I went back at like 8:30 to help him clean it up. And when we pulled up he had THANKA AK written with TP on his car! IT was soo cute. He cleaned up some and then we did the rest. All in all it was a good time. Then saturday i went to work and that was fun. Then i went to Sarahs and Garett, Benson, Rachael, Annie, and Tony all came over. It was fun. We all danced and Jumped on the trampoline. Then Sunday i went to church with Rach and Troy from work was there.. hes so cute. Then i went to work and had fun with Ashley and Aaron! Then i went back to sarahs and Me Annie Jerrid, Tony, Charles and Sarah went to see a movie. After the movie annie and charles left and me and the two boys and sarah played Truth or Dare.

"event","Today was fun. It started good and its gonna end good. After school, Andy, Tom, Peter, Kyle, Jolie, Rachael, Ashlee, and I all went to Wendy's! it was way fun. Andy and Tom both had orgasums when they saw this one type of mustang.. it was quite funny! I got my pictures from Prom Developed and I must say me and Josh looked pretty swanky! w00t! 

Yesterday I came home from school because i didnt feel good. And I slept from 11:45 until 2:45 then from like 5 tp 7 and then from like 11 to 8 this morning! It was amazing. Oh And i had a really GREAT dream.. But we wont get into it. 

I went to the lacross game for a little bit.. and we lost.. and i went to the soccer game for a little bit.. but Kelli was already done so i couldnt watch her.. But then I went to chruch, and had some really good converstaions with Sean and some other people. It was good just to sit down and have a conversation about nothing in particular for once. I havent done that in soo long. It felt good. And some of the things we talked about were funny. Like old Nickleodeon T.V. shows. I think those are some of the best conversations.. Oh ya remember Heeeeeyyyy DUuudeee. i dont think that was on Nick.. but it was good. 

I realized something the other day. I dont think im going to get into a relationship with a nother person for a long time. Because when i do it ALWAYs messes us relationships with other people.. EXAMPLES.. Bloomberg... I stoped being friends with him and kyle and lindsey. Norris is still a good friend! I love him! Derrick Piper and Nick Reaves..im no longer friends with really either of them.. or Megan or Mark.. i wish i was but im really not.. me and nick still talk and stuff but not a lot.. Derek A... I love him to death but were not friends.. i wish sometimes i could just give him a big hug... but it would be wierd.. me and jake and eric arent really Great friends like we used to be.. but thats going to change because im not giving those guys up.. Hey ADULF we should go to whiteys tomorrow.. after i moe.. lol dont laugh.. we can see his mommy!! anyway.. now with the whole Garett thing.. I feel like no matter what we say .. Im not going to be friends with like Tony and Scott and Jerid.. and it sucks .. i mean i KNOW im going to be friends with Garett.. but with the other boys.. i just dunno.. 

THAT DREAM WAS FUCKING AWESOME!! hahah I have to work this weekend.. you should come and see me! Friday 5-9:30 and saturday 11-2! oh yea! IM OUT LIKE A FAT KID IN DODGE BALL!!!"

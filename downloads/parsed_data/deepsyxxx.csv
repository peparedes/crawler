ok i drove a shitload yesterday and was listening to 99x out of atlanta for about 4 hours and their little morning show was on for half that time, they were talkin about how pathetic it was for adults to be all into this harry potter shit and how people wree soooo upset over the ending but they weren't gonna give it away. 

Finally someone calls in and one of the hosts tells them to just say the ending, he did and what followed was some of the funniest radio i have ever heard in my life, people pissed off, one of the hosts singing ""the head master dies"" in 10 different song styles, a woman calling in saying she reads to her husband every night before he goes to bed and how her husband was very upset that the ending was given away. 

I'm in the process of trying to find recordings of it, because my god it was funny."

So yea...a good amount of shit has been going on lately, hopefully i can remember everything.  But first, 2 things...

Number one: I'M NOT IN JAIL! We called the court on wednesday and talked to my probation dude who said he doesn't want to put me in jail so i scrounged up 100 bucks to mail to him, and even though the entire 1080 bucks was due in FEB. of this year, and it's already 4 months late, dude said he'd give me ANOTHER year to pay my fines off, do i have the best fucking luck or what? Kick Nuts!

Second...MY MOTHERFUCKING BIRTHDAY IS THURSDAY, JUNE 23RD, WHATCHALL GETTIN ME?

Speaking of birthday's, Happy Birthday  Lizzie

OK now...First, We'll talk about the  GOOD SHIT:

First off, I met this chick last weekend...she rocks, whoa...does she. But we've only hung out once cuz she's always busy or never able to get outta the house which totally blows. I'd definately like to kick it with her alot more cuz as i said, she rules... hopefully she's gonna come to the bar b q with us tomorrow, if not...i dunno. Maybe if she wasn't running cars into the back of old ladies she'd be able to hang out more, eh?

Ooooh......Me and moe are going to michigan during the time the gathering is going on, and probably at LEAST a couple days afterwards, i'm doing a guest spot as a piercer for a good friend of mine while she goes to the gathering. I'm not sure how long after she gets back we're going to stay but i'm kinda hoping it's a little bit at least, everytime i talk to said person i enjoy her and her ""company"" more and more, we'll see what happens with that i guess

Moe and I started working on a new song the other day and ooh wee is it bad ass, we've got the bass, lead , and rhythm lines figured out completely for verse and prechorus/bridge...we just gotta get the chorus worked out on it which i'm sure wont take long.

Cooked out today, me moe and mercy had 6 huge fuckin steaks all to ourselves, we were all stuffed like whoa by the time we finished, it ruled

And now the bad shit...I really fucking miss someone and there's nothing i can really do about it, not as if she'd give a shit anyways but yea, it's been bothering the FUCK out of me the past 2 days seeing Moe and Mercy hangin all over each other and me sittin there by myself, majorly fucking gay. I'm happy that Moe found a chick he's really into but at the same time it just reminds me that i have no one and it makes me all shitty, Oh well...karma's a bitch, i'll have my time soon enough

Amber's not allowed to talk to me anymore, i guess something i said as a joke in her live jounal pissed ogar off and he said he doesn't want her talking to me anymore. It's not like we talk that much anymore anyways, but it still sucks cuz it's nice to hear from my little one every once in a while.

My laptop and cell phone dissapeared from the shop last week, but we know who stole them, or who was involved in stealing them rather, i don't really give a shit about the laptop other than the fact that i had alotta guitar shit on there that i need/want but the fact that he took my phone is some hoe ass shit, all my fucking phone numbers are GONE, i never remember anyone's phone number anymore so i'm royally fucked on that tip. But like i said, karma's a motherfuckin bitch, and i'ma fuck his shit up when i see him, and then let the bounty hunter's loose on his ass, fucking chickenhead junkie motherfucker...you'll get yours, bet on that shit.

I'm growing more and more tired of columbus, i've realized there is nothing here for me anymore and i gotta get the fuck out of here, i've been slowly but surely going apeshit from boredom and the only release i have lately is my music and drugs, and the drugs ain't good for me so i gotta do something to get away from all this shit...i just don't know what, hopefully the michigan trip will open a new window for me and everything will start to go well, who knows."

Shanna and i aren't ""dating"" anymore, because she decided we're both getting attatched too quickly, and yet we went to the movies tuesday night ""just as friends"" and ended up making out for the entire movie ""just as friends"" I'm going over her house tonight after work to lay out and watch the stars...but...""just as friends"" I wonder how long it'll be before we start having sex again...but...""just as friends""

I stretched my PA to a 10 gauge last tuesday night when i got drunk, also got my tongue pierced twice monday, and then again last night...pics of all the new fun stuff coming as soon as i feel like taking them.  I talked to steph from Jersey last night for a couple hours cuz i was all depressed and she made me feel better...she rocks.

I miss talking to my sister, i haven't seen her online or anything in a while, and whenever i call her i get the answering machine


it's like one big fucking joke to the world, isn't it?

Yea, they're growing on me, i guess i like the way i look, but i dunno... 

D and I haven't really been talking lately at all, there's not a real reason for it, we just don't have much to talk about, but it still bothers me alot...we used to sit on the phone all night long and talk about nothing but now we hardly talk at all. I guess she has alot of things that she needs to think about and deal with, so i don't know if i should call her...or wait for her to call me, or what...i just really miss talking to her like we used to, and i haven't seen her in a week or 2, so i dunno what to do, i think i'll let her take care of everything she needs to and then try to talk to her, i don't want to bother her while she's taking care of her stuff and have her get mad at me for bugging her. 

In other news, i went swimming at troy's apartment yesterday, that was pretty fresh, word.

I might be getting a job as an assistant manager at wendy's, that'd rule...

It was really weird, but what was even weirder was when it was over i woke up in a cold sweat breathing really heavy, that's the part i didn't understand.

Heather paid for me to get my ear's pierced last night, i wanted to start at 8G but they could only start me at 12 because she had only jewelry up to 12G released to her, if i wanted anything bigger i would have had to pay for the jewelry, rather...heather would, lol. but she was broke after getting them, so yea. I'll post pics of them tonight.

It's weird, i never wanted to get my ear's pierced, i dunno why...i just didn't think it would look right on me, but they actually look pretty good, i'm gonna stretch 'em out and get smaller diameter rings once they heal, but yea...they don't look too bad. like i said, pics coming soon!"

"event","Man...i just wish i knew what was going on, there's so many things left unsaid, and i've been in a really weird mood since about 10PM last night. Troy and his girl came over and we watched school of rock and girl next door, that was pretty cool, but my mind was elsewhere...thinking...yea. Seems i been doing alot of <i>thinking</i> lately and i don't know what it means, or what to do about the situation, but i'm pretty cool with the way things are going, so it's ok. I just wish i could say certain things to certain friends, but i can't bring myself to do it.

This weekend was pretty productive, one of the balls from my PA fell out so and i couldn't find it so i went and got a CBR for it, and then i found out that the red ball i had in my labret ring fits the horseshoe that was in my PA (which is really shouldn't, because it's a 14G and the PA is a 12G, but it's acrylic so it stretches)  So yea, that's pretty cool, i'm starting to think i should have gotten the smaller CBR but i'm worried that when i get a hard on it'll be too small and pinch/rip a little bit, so i might have to test that theory, who knows. One cool thing is i can still take the ball out of the CBR when i want to take it out without having to use pliers, but i also don't have to worry about the ball unscrewing and falling out when i have it in, i'm thinking the cbr is the way to go.

I'm gonna get one of those spikes for my labret like david from disturbed has...
<img src=""http://www.steelnavel.com/images/L14516CS134_400.JPG"">
and i'm also probably going to buy another CBR for my PA, cuz i saw this on a site last night and almost shit myself, think about how cool it would be hanging from the old dick'ola:
<img src=""http://www.painfulpleasures.com/body_jewelry/gallery/Captive_Rings/Jeweled/JR003.gif"">
How awesome would that be? You're right, it would be really awesome.

I took my smiley out...it's been migrating for about a month, and there was a tiny peice of skin left over the ring, and i decided to just say fuck it and take it out, in about a month or 2 once it completely heals i'll get it redone, but right now it's kinda nice to be able to bite things without it getting in the way ~_o

God i hate Troy's girlfriend, she doesn't like me because she's on that whole ""he's taking you away from me"" thing, it's funny though cuz troy's like ""bitch i knew him long before i even met your ass""   It's like, i wouldn't have a problem with her, but she's so fucking stupid, she's a 16 year old drama queen high school student and she thinks she knows evverrrrrryyyything, it's fucking sad. Like a week or 2 ago, somehow we got on the topic of gay people, and how they are born with it, it's not a choice. And of course her being a black chick from the backwoods in a shit town in alabama, she's like ""it is a choice, that's just nasty, blah blah blah blah blah"" and i started getting really pissed because she's sitting here arguing with me like she has any fucking clue at all, so i finally just said ""fuck it, you're right, you know everything""    So then last night, she somehow or another called troy a monkey, and we laughed about it and me and troy went back and forth going ""dude, that's racist, she called you a big lip monkey"" blah blah blah, and you know what this stupid twat says?   ""well, we're primates!""   ...here's how the conversation went, between me and her:

""well, we're primates!""
""no...we're not""
""yea we are! we're primates!""
""no, stupid, we EVOLVED from primates, we're homosapiens, it's different""
""i got my notebook out in the car, i'll show you""
""you don't have to fucking show me, it would just prove how stupid you really are, bottom line, we evolved from primates, we're not fucking primates, do you know what the word primitive even means?""
""what EVER!!! we're primates!!!""
""SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU STUPID CUNT""
""BUT WE ARE!""
""ok...fine...whatever, you're right, like always, i'm not going to keep this 'intelligent'(insert finger quotation marks here) conversation with you, because we know how well versed on issues YOU are. (refering to the gay discussion from a couple weeks ago)""

It's like, i don't have a problem with stupid people, i feel bad for them some times, but when someone swears up and down they know what they're talking about, when it's plainly obvious that they are fucking CLUELESS, i get heated really quick, i wouldn't hate her if she didn't hate me, but i tell troy all the time that she's a fucking mongoloid, and he just laughs. Boy it's a good thing she doesn't know how to get to my journal...shit, i doubt she even knows how to use a computer, anyways. Yea, long story short, troy's girlfriend is one of the most ignorant human beings alive, and she hates me, ergo...i hate her. And she's really fucking stupid...really...really, stupid

I'll be making about 150 a week, maybe a little less...i figure with phone bill, general shit, and ciggarettes, plus my car/insurance payments(once i get them) i'll have maybe 100 bucks left each month, which wont be bad, i still have to pay that 1000 dollar fine or my ass is going back to jail, but after that i dunno...

I also start school in july, WOOOT! Computer Networking...today when i was looking at the jobs from Sunday i must have saw about 15 ""Computer Network Specialists Wanted""  Ad's, so hopefully all those jobs will still be up when i finish school next year, i'm sure there will be a couple at least. 

After about a week me and grandma are going to look around and try to find an eclipse for about 3-4 grand and get a loan for it, hopefully payments will be about 100 a month, but my insurence is gonna be like 150 a month or maybe a little more, because of my ticket's and shit...so that'll suck, but we'll figure it out.

<h2>You Are an Indifferent Ex</h2><font color=""red"">
You're not one of those guys who thinks about his exes - or even remembers them<br>
""Love 'em and Leave 'em"" is your motto. And your break ups tend to be a clean break.<br>
It's a nice strategy to have, and girls appreciate your total lack of emotional baggage.<br>
But just a little reminder: it is okay to remember the good parts of your past, even with exes.

Where young cats buy gats, shoot and never look back
Where the whites live with the whites, and the blacks live with the blacks
But somehow we unite, through the culture of rap
I'm from Brooklyn, word to the Dodgers, Russian massages
Where thugs bust guns, and sons are raised without they fathers
We do away with has-beens, rock the latest fashion
The rule's never rat - what you want to know, or who's askin
Just some habits of highly effective MC's
Y'all is pussy rap, my speech made you weak in the knees
But talk's cheap, I'm straight from the streets
I'm action-oriented when I'm screamin KILL CORRUPT POLICE
I read books, reap intelligence to compromise my bad looks
I roam with God-bodies and crooks

"event","So yea...Shits been pretty good lately, i been running to try and lose weight, i was on the phone last night and didn't realize how much i walked and ended up walking about 8 miles, after i got off the phone i ran another 2, for some reason i didn't get tired at all, my feet didn't hurt or anything. The only reason i stopped was because my ribs started hurting all of a sudden and my lungs were burning, so i figured that would be a good time to stop.

I got 100 Bucks from my grandfather to go towards my fines today, so hopefully i'll have my liscence back ASAP...I also got my ""A Dozen Black Roses"" Book that D' bought me from amazon <333

I think that's pretty much all that's been going on lately, i been busting my ass trying to find a job but nothing's happened with that yet, my grandfather might get me a job at the post office sorting mail at night making like 10 bucks an hour, but who knows.

<h2>Your Seduction Stye: ""Sweet Talker""</h2>
Your seduction technique can be summed up with ""charm""<br><br>
You know that if you have the chance to talk to someone...<br><br>
Well, you won't be talking for long! ;-)
<br><br><br>
You're great at telling potential lovers what they want to hear<br><br>
Partially, because you're a great reflective listener and good at complementing<br><br>
The other part of your formula? Focusing your conversation completely on the other person.
<br><br><br>
Your ""sweet talking"" ways have taken you far in romance - and in life<br><br>
You can finess your way through any difficult situation, with a smile on your face.<br><br>
Speeding tickets, job interviews... bring it on! You truly live a *charmed life*

Pretty much sums up what i've been feelin like lately, i dunno what the fuck has been going on. I lost one of the people i care about the most because i had no way of getting ahold of her, but it's still my fault, everything is always my fault, i've accepted that fact.

Let's see...what's been going on lately...after i got out of jail i went on a couple coke binges for days on end, and after someone refused to talk to me and let me explain what's been going on i did a half ounce in about 3 days...drowned my sorrows, as it were. I just wish you would talk to me and understand why i didn't want to bring you down with me and make you upset by dealing with my bullshit, but it's too late i guess.

I got kicked out of the house, i'm staying at my grandparents until friday, they wont let me stay any longer, hopefully i can find a place by then, if not i'll either be on the streets or in a shelter, i'm thinking about jacking a car and hauling ass to new york, since there's nothing left for me down here. At least if i get caught i'll have a place to stay, right? I might end up pawning my guitar and some other shit to get some money to take care of myself.

On the up side...i got my GED diploma in the mail today, which means i could start school in the summer, not as if it matters since i wont have a place to stay or any way to get to school.

I been writing alot of lyrics and shit lately, maybe i'll decide to post something up here, or even write something new, who knows

If you read this...please talk to me."

Hopefully she digs him cuz if she doesn't she wont stay and help with the apartment, ain't no thing either way i guess, it'll just take longer to get an apartment with just the 2 of us.

I'm going to take my GED test on the 7th! roCK! I gotta go like a half hour away to take it though, that's pretty gay espicially since i have to be there at 7:30 which means i'll have to get up at like 6AM that day...WHACK"

<h2>Your Tongue's Talent is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/lickingpussy.html"">Licking Pussy</a>!</h2>
Your small slippery tongue is just perfect for fitting in those little folds. You're not shy about giving pleasure, and you demand it back.
<br><br>
You're perfect at working it all over, licking and slurping. You love the warm moistness of coochie, and you savor the flavor.
<br><br>
Watch out though, you don't want a permanent catfish smell on your breath. Next time you go down on her, throw in an Altoid for some flavor.
<br><br>
You'd be most compatible with a Rimmer. You both absolutely love exploring deep, dark places with your tongue, and you can teach each other a couple of tricks. A Rimmer is sure to get you to open up a bit, and quit being so secretive!

1. if ur counting something he just yells out random numbers

2. he always adjusts the tint on the tv like everytime i watch tv with him so that the people are tinted green...and he will never let me fix it hes alwyas like i like it like that??

3. when u ask him to staple something he will .. but he will staple it in the middle of the page everytime it never fails

4. he calls 1 800 numbers and asks the people out on a date because he thinks its hysterical..he does that like 2 times a day it was funny at first but not anymore..lol

5. he sets alarm clocks for random times??

6. he changes the tv channel 5 mins before the end of every show

7. when we got to resturants he has gone it and all he has ordered were the mints that they have for free at the cash register and water...why even bother making a reservation for that?

8. he gets orange traffic cones for free from his uncles work or something he him and simon because they think its funny go out and put them across random streets to see people turn around and go a different way?? they crack up to! thats not funny!?!

9. he pays for a lot of things in pennies..like just because he thought it would be funny he has 5 dollars in change coming to him and he asks if the lady can give it to him in pennies and she does and it took forever to sit there and get it counted out

10. just to be annoying he repeats half the shit u say as a question even though he heard u the first time

11. he made me and kiley only call him ""Conquistador"" for like 3 days straight and got mad when we forgot?

12. omg it was kind of funny but we went to the laundry mat and he put 1 sock in each washer thing and like took up 2 and people were in line waiting and he only wash 2 socks...:-/ it was really funny

i could have gone into detail but i didn't feel like typing, erin remember last night 'shoot me' or was it 'sue me' lol. that was so funny i love you so much thanks for being there for me and kiley i know she is thankful to we really needed a friend to be there. and even though u and her weren't that close u came anyway. thats a true best friend. i love you. and i feel like i need to talk to you more often. oooo and i love hearing the stories from az again and again and again so don't worry about it. kt's so cool i don't mind hearing about her all the time. lol.

NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU. it sucks really bad. i just want to break down and cry. but i can't. i need to be strong and show him he is an asshole a mother fucking ass hole and even though he killed back then..i have to pretend it did nothing and that i am strong. fuck what am i talking about i am weaker then ever. have a great vacation.

i'm in my room and bored
the boredom rain has poured
nothing to do
i'm telling you
i'm bored out of my gourd


with video i've dwelled
four systems, one handheld
for what its worth
i saved the earth
when aliens rebel


i built six models, and
made sculptures out of sand
watched 8 tapes
and fought the apes
then led a marching band


i got tears in my eyes
days like this i despise
my parents are
still sleeping and
its hours till sunrise


hehe my little brother has been singing that over and over cause its one of hte only songs he knows because he learned it in preschool today. wow how exciting to be able to hear a new song everyday when he gets home

ahhhh its driving me nuts and its been one day with one song

"event","The stupid RATS got a journal!  Why don't WE have a cool nickname?  They get called the ""BedlamRats"" and we are just plain US.

Wait... Momma just said we are special and because it is DIFFERENT to not have a group name for us.

Okay, that I can live with.

They do call us ""The Kittens"" all the time, and that is degrading!

My Momma is sick today.  The other momma took her to the hospital.  She was crying and moaning and talking about her back.

OH, I did not tell you.  My stupid claw that I lost last week is all red and bloody today, so momma wrapped it all up in white soft stuff with medicine on it and tape!  YES, she TAPED it to my FUR so that I can't remove it!  I shoooook and shooook and shooook my paw, but it didn't go anywhere.  It was VERY annoying.

I wonder how she plans to get it OFF my fur?

Momma is sleeping right now, and the other momma looks like she is about to fall asleep where she is sitting.  She is supposed to stay awake cause she has to go pick up daddy this morning.  She is soooooooooo tired though.  She keeps nodding.

I just went to check on Momma who is talking in her sleep.  She is saying some odd stuff.  The other momma told me that they gave her DEMEROL to help her feel better and that DEMEROL is very strong medicine.  But momma talks this way sometimes when she is NOT on the medicine.

Oh, Momma just laughed and explained things to me.  That's silly.

Anyway... This typing is annoying me with my bandaged paw.  I should go.

Thank you for reading

"event","So, this morning when Daddy Teeb got up, I started feeling sick.  I got sicker and sicker and sicker and finally started to gag.  Daddy yelled at me and I got scared, so I ran next to the trash can and puked all explody-like.  Daddy scooped me up, which scared me even more and he held me over the trash can.  I kept kicking and gagging and then I just gave up and puked all over in the trash can.  Daddy petted me and asked me why I was so sick and called me ""buddy"" like he does when I am sad.  I was very happy to be petted, but then he put me down to clean everything up.

Momma number 2 (The Nori Momma) came out later and when Daddy told her about the puking, she scooped me up and cuddled with me cooing lots of things about me being sick.  She is very nice, but she worries too much.  I think it is just a hairball.

Momma number 1 (The Kyla Momma) got told the whole story and she picked me up and looked me in the eyes for a long time.  I tried to tell her it was just a hairball, but she is very worried, I can tell.  She mentioned a word she has said a few times that Aunt Sami always runs when it is mentioned.  That word was Vet.  I wonder what a vet is?

Well, Kee just ran by and I need to run after him and be a general pain-in-the-collective-ass.  Be back later!

She hides. Dark in night, the sky breathes her name. See the skin on her back? Not who she is. No one knows who she is. ""Are you ok girl?"" Her heart is dead but her feet still dance. The ocean's a grave, fly from the soul. The grave digger loves her but the stars dread her. She's unknown to those of us who understand. She makes no sense. See her the way you want. Change description, break your heart. Taste of air cleanses the mind but her veins do not pump. Shaken there into destiny, she holds it in her hands. Sleep is only calling, for eternal shelter. Smoke stays in her hair but the mist is too cold to catch. Only if you stop the world. Only if she stops the world. Maybe she'll die on the outside this time."

The one word you use to describe everything. You say the abuse helped you. You think that you can't trust him. He stares at you with his books. Not only do you hear his whimpers of fear, you feel his heart beat. The burning ashes caress your thoughts. Poison runs deep through her veins. She sits there in a silence thoughts can not disturb. Lonely forever, for no one to understand her. She's prisoned in sorrow. Retreat, run away, escape. She knows no one will understand. Is she left alone? No, because no one was there in the first place. Blacker than night her blood runs thick. She fears them. Dearest child, you burn me with a glance, yet I can not pull away. I swear your eyes are bleeding. ""No,"" she says, ""those are yours."" My bloody tears made her laugh. Is she smiling? It was the last thing I saw. Dearest child, your hands are cold.</FONT>"

<p>
Those times when you had silence clinging in your throat, remind you of death. Do they speak to you the same way the dagger did when it rest in your hand? Is it the thought of a suicide that gives you energy? Or is it the mere thought of someone blowing their head off that makes you crave it? You taste sincerity, you hold it in your grasp. Aren't these thoughts making you anxious? They make me want to drown in them. As you take your hand in hers, remember one thing. She is only the image of the girl you once knew. Beware of all those things she says, for she can not be trusted. When you hold her in your arms she has a smirk on her face for she is depleting your imagry, along with hers. I see you, you know it too. All you want is to slit your throat, so why don't you do it? Because you want to linger in your suffering. So when the knife goes to your wrist next time, remember it is your fault. You could simply have it end, but then, wouldn't we all be in pain? Who should take the pain more? You or me? Them or you? Tough question isn't it? Pain. Think about it."

He stops infront of her once they reach &amp; she walks by him. He turns around &amp; she doesn't look back, not even once. He starts to follow her then he stumbles to the ground.

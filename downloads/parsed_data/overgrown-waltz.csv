"event","<center>so, for the first time in my <i>entire</i> life, i lost my cell phone.  i cried.  seriously.  it was my only means of contact with many people because it was the only place i kept phone numbers and many of you are states and states away.  i am writing with a sincere and dire request: please, everyone email me or call my cell (the number for which is still the same and still has voicemail) and leave your cell numbers/any other numbers pertinent and current which you use (like dorm numbers, gouldies!!!).  and if there's anyone else's number who's not on livejournal that you know i once had, if you would send that along/leave it in the message too i would be so intensely and eternally grateful.  don't fret now, i'll still be intensely and eternally grateful even if the only number you leave is your own.  ;)  my email addresses are geebygirl74@aol.com or geebygirl@yahoo.com.  you can use either, or call my voicemail if you have my number.  please spread the word around to people you know who aren't on livejournal (like alexa and baba, for the gouldies) and let them know to call me because, really, i have <i><b>no</b></i> means of contact beyond my phone for lack of email addresses.

i know that this is a pain in the ass, but pleaseplease<i>please</i> humor me and make recollecting phone numbers a little bit easier.  and, in advance, to anyone who follows up on this: i can <b>not</b> thank you enough.  love to all!

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?
Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me
Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?
But now the dreams and waking screams

So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

rebekah, the girl who makes my coffee, last night hanging out.  i wish this picture did her justice.  alas...
~~~
we, rebekah and i, had a really good time last night.  we went to this open mic down in richmond, not the city, the area of san francisco, and got coffee and chilled.  we then went back to her place and just sat and talked for something like three and a half hours.  it was really fun.  we have a <b>ton</b> in common, i felt like.  it was kind of eerie.  she reminds me a lot of leigh, but in the best ways.  she's older than i am and knows a lot about the world even though she's never been more than a hundred miles out of california.  i like her.  she was a really cool gal.  i just said gal.  well, i guess i wrote it so it doesn't really count.  good.  so now that that's settled i have to get back to work.  i love you, kiddies!

"event","<center>still working at ACT.  work is going fabulously.  my boss maureen, who i call mo, calls me kiddo, takes smoke breaks with me, lets me move into her office and work from her <u>really</u> comfotable couch every day, <i>AND</i> let me go gift shopping this afternoon at anthropologie after i got out of a stage combat rehearsal that she got me in to.  she is positively the best boss that this world has ever known.  i absolutely adore her.  she's great.  work has been amazing even though it's been a lot of bitch work.  to tell you the truth, i really don't mind the bitch work.  i must say i'm pretty darn good at xeroxing things and stuffing them into envelopes and transcripting and all of that, so it's really kind of fun.  i don't think i've ever had a better time in an office.
~~~
this morning when i went to get coffee after i had been at work for an hour and a half or so, i went to this little independent coffee house called Madeline's.  this place was so cute and fresh and the moment i walked in the girl behind the counter (this amazingly hot butch girl with a shaved head, two thick rings in each ear, a dark navy hooded misfits sweatshirt on under her work apron, and baggy black boy dickies) gives me a once over and says, in an honestly sincere way, ""that's quite an array of genres you have going on in that outfit.  the eightball belt really ties everything together...i don't know if you could pull it off otherwise..."" i have never had anyone flatter/hit on me quite so unabashedly, and i really kind of enjoyed it (especially because i'm taken and it's not like anything will ever happen, it's just nice to know that i'm still attractivev to other people...*smiles* [i love you, baby] &hearts;).  so we talked for a bit and i got my coffee and went outside to sit in the sunshine and sip on the mocha i had just purchased.  i'm sitting there no more than two and a half minutes when she comes out to change the bag in the outside trash can, which clearly doesn't need changing being that it wasn't even half full, and says ""oh, now i <i>know</i> you're a bad girl...smoking and whathaveyou.""  so i introduce myself and she does the same and asks me if i know where the cool kids hang out in the city.  i tell her that i usually head up to haight street for the hanging out and whatnots and she looks at me and says ""i'm impressed, i spin every friday night on haight...you should come see me this week...""  so i say ""really? (sounding impressed at myself...[hee hee]), maybe i'll do that.  i have a friend coming up that night.  we'll probably stop by.  ...look for my belt buckle."" and she says ""you know, i probably won't remember your name but i'll for sure remember your belt.  i'll get you in back, we'll party."" and i say ""great...i'll see you then."" and we say our goodbyes and i go on my way.  it was NUTS.  i have never been hit on like that.  of course i'm not going to go and like meet her for dinner or anything, but i do think that i'll take leigh and tor to go see her spin on friday.  i <b>need</b> a night of dancing.  it'll be great.  we'll all get crunked after and have a good time.  maybe i can work it so that joy can come up and spend the night...i'm going to get on that.  right now.

so here's my story, your honor: when my mom came out to maine for quite the visit she brought her new digital camera.  sounds all fancy schmancy, right?  well, it was.  but she forgot one minor detail.  a USB cable.  that means that i was unable to post <i>any</i> of the pictures i took whilest i was out there...whilest i was out there.  that said i'll give y'all a few of them now.  shall we?

as if eight photos weren't enough, that will be all for now, kiddies.  i'm really proud of myself for listening carefully enough to joy's instructions to remember how to do all that.  i hope it all works.
so now that i'm feeling sufficiently vain and sleep-deprived (that's right, kiddies, i haven't gone to bed yet and it's 6:55 am...) i think i'll get up and take a shower before driving into the city for work.  oh!  another thing!  i start work today!  my internship with ACT!  yah-hooo!!!  maybe i should have slept.  ah, well...i was busy.  ...being a nerd.  wow, i get cooler and cooler as every day goes by.  i. am. <b>awesome</b>.  and it's ok, right?  right.

saturday is the day, kiddos.  saturday i will finally be home.  palo alto, california, yo.  that's what i'm talking about.  god, i'm so ready.  i've been ready for the past month and a half.  and it's finally here.  wah-hooooo!!!  i'm <i>so</i> fucking stoked.  stoked to see all my lovies, my cali babies.  stoked to be around people who say hella and...stoked.  ;)  stoked to be in a place where people actually <u>want</u> to spend time with me, who will go out of their way to pick me up and hang out for a few hours, who say i love you on a regular basis.  stoked to be <b>home</b>.  god, i'm so excited.  it's going to be so good.  then on monday i'm off to san francisco for a week for my internship at ACT.  i'm staying with my cousin carly and her boyfriend ari at their apartment in the mission so that i don't have to commute to sf every morning (which is such a relief).  walking or taking muni to work.  waking up with coffee and cigarettes.  mmm, it's going to be really good.  <i>really</i> good.  i'm so excited for ACT.  sure, i'll be doing a lot of bitch work (i.e. stuffing envelopes, making phone calls, xeroxing, taking phone calls, organizing costume rooms and prop shops, <i>etc</i>.), but i also get to do a lot of fun things like sit in on and help out with rehearsals, help with brainstorming new ideas for shows in project meetings, mend costumes, usher a few shows (which means i get in free!), and perhaps even work backstage for a couple of performances.  it should be really amazing.  i finally get to see what an actual working theatre looks like. how it all functions. and how things happen and come to be.  it's going to be great.  ah, i'm so excited.  toto and kitta and joy are all going to try and come up and hang out with me while i'm there, too.  perhaps stay a night if they can.  i'm so excited to be staying with carly for the week, it will be great.  she and i have been trying to figure out a time for me to come up and take a weekend with her for over a year but it's always fallen through before.  but now i get to stay with her and ari. couch surf, <i>and</i> work in the city.  for a week!  another wah-hoo!  ha.  then i'm home.  home again, home again, jiggity jig.  for three weeks or so...maybe a little bit less, i'm not sure.  home to palo alto.  god, most people there really don't know what they have.  how amazing it is there.  what kind of a town it is.  how lucky they are to live there.  it's such a good place.  and you don't really know until you're gone.  until you don't have it anymore.  so many kids at my old high school spend so much time complaining about living there, saying how everything is so uptight and rigid and how all they want to do is get out and that they can't wait to leave.  it makes me want to vomit.  i miss living there so much.  i mean, sure, it has it's faults, but what place doesn't?  honestly.  if any of them tried living in bethel for even a week, they would run home screaming to their [figurative] mommies, begging to never be sent away.  it's such an amazing place, and so few people actually know it.  *sighs*  they'll realize it someday, i hope.

well, that was quite the satisfactory entry.  i love you, and to those of you in maine who i'm actually friends with, i miss you.  i hope your breaks are great and restful and that your four-points are wonderful.  i can't wait to see you all and hear about everything when we're all back.  until then, adieu.  to those of y'all who wear fanny-packs...no, just kidding, bad ben fold's reference.  to those of y'all in cali, i love you and miss you terribly, and i can't wait to see you in two days!!!!!  i love you i love you i love you i love you!

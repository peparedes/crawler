All i tried to do was dye it a nice brown and get a trim, but instead i get hair that's about an inch above my shoulders, too long to be cute and too short to do anything, and it's currently a golden reddish color, because the brown decided to not show up.

I'm babysitting on New Year's Eve, which is okay because i am making a shitload of money and that's good, BUT somehow i picked up an extra kid, and they were scared because they don't live here, and then they passed out on the couch. And then when her mom called she said not to move her, so now i'm stuck with no TV, no noise, no nothing. Only the stinking computer, and my sparkling apple cider, which is half gone already. 

Also: Yesterday i basically embarrassed myself at Nick's because i got sick and threw up on his carpet at his going away party. SWEET. I didn't even drink anything. I can drink like a tank and not have a hangover, but when i have a migrane, WATCH OUT! i may puke on you.

I'm working a lot this week, which means lots of dinero on my paycheck.
I got tickets to see Anberlin. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY i love them. 
I'm also going to get tickets to see Cartel and Cobra Starship and Boys Like Girls, but they don't go on sale to the public for another two weeks, and i'm too lazy to get a credit card and buy them presale. 
Winterfest is on my 18th birthday, and i'm going to skip it and go clubbing with Dave, because winterfest is lame.

So we went to mass tonight and there are these two girls who go to my church who sing well, but they have to sing louder and longer than everyone else to show it off. and at first i was like, whatever, they're good singers, but now it's really bugging me, because they do it only for attention. Ok, so you can sing...do you really have to rub it in everyone else's face?

"event","Yearbook party was fun! lots of random questioning and catch phrase and more good clean fun. Then we drove home behind Christine at an average of 23mph (the speed limit was 55mph). EWWW then Wes almost died because he passed us both.
ALSO yesterday was a pretty sweet concert. TheAudition is always amazing, even when the crowd is completely bitchy (well get to that in a sec) and they play acoustic when they really didn't have to play at all. And the first band was crazy. Like, I've never seen a crowd more pumped for the first band. The lead singer jumped off the 12 foot speaker and crowd surfed. I've never seen ANYONE do that, let alone the first band. SO check out Madena Lake (sorry if that's spelled wrong or something). BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING a lot of people in the crowd were really really ridiculous. For the record, I was sick and throwing up chicken nuggets (gross...sorry) and there were girls saying that I ""couldn't handle it."" (that's crap...thanks). and there was this kid who got all up in my face and another in a bandana who thought he was badass and another girl who blatantly pushed me in the back be cause i got in front of her. Whatever...concert drama is stupid. And it must have been good because i'm sore...HA whatever

Peanut Butter Jelly time will be forever stuck in my head.

Tomorrow starts Secret Santa Season...yeaaa! I better not get screwed over...

Tomorrow is also the 2nd concert of the 6 day concert season...Murder by Death. Also seeing the Format, AAR, MCS, and Boys Like Girls on Monday.  YAAAAAY.

The commercial with the Asian guy singing/rapping in the bathroom gets me every time. So does Tourette's guy. I know it's horrible and i'm sorry but it's hilarious.

So David and I have been very off and on over the past week or two, and I kept thinking about if i made a good desicion and if he was going to be alright and all that post-breakup madness, and I'm happy to say i made a good choice not to be with him, but that conclusion came with a whole hell of a lot of bullshit that hit me deep. I've been made fun of and I've been laughed at and all that cruel shit, but I haven't been this hurt by anything like that since middle school. Ugh. 

I'm happy the truth came out, and I'm happy it's final, I'm just sad at the way it happened. I wish it wasn't so messy.

So in Applied economics, our company name was BAMF (business associates of marketing and finance...not the other thing you dirty thinkers...) and I kind of didn't think anyone was going to take us seriously, but whatever, i never really remember voting on the name. But anyways, it died. It didn't just get shot down, it got stomped on and spit on and it's legs broken with a sledgehammer. I'm in complete and utter shock (sarcasm). I mean if they don't accept BOOTY shirts, what makes anyone think they're going to accept THAT?! now we're all going to get competely bitched out by Mr. drabek, because he got bitched out for something he didn't even do, and something he thought had been approved, but actually hadn't. Thats not fair to him, or anyone for that matter.

I'm also having a serious problem with certain types of people also. I hate when people dress compeltely insane or do stupid shit or listen to a certain type of music because it's different, not because they like it, and then they look down on you because you're all ""sheep,"" but really, they're sheep because they're following what they think is different for the sole purpose of looking like they have more class than you. I also hate when people namedrop, especially music. I also hate when people you thought were friends are actually stupid and bitchy. I hate when my boyfriend is sarcastic, and when all of my friends are sick and not at school. I hate when basketball practice is frusterating, and i hate my ankle. (WHEW...that was a load off).


Well that was fun! Other exciting things in mi vida:

DAVID GOT A RED CARD because he PUNCHED A KID IN THE STOMACH!! haha who even saw that coming? oh i love that kid
ANBERLIN is on SUNDAY!!!
Lots of babysitting this weekend = lots of babysitting MONEY this weekend...and lots of time with my 2 fav. girls!
Tomorrow is Thursday...and i am a tad excited, because that's almost friday, and david has a game that he can't play in
JNet is home this weekend!
Homecoming was badass...i wore striped tights!
Yesterday, Dee and Lindsey ran into each other. funniest basketball moment we've had so far...

Alrighty...more later when i feel like it.

Wow. i was in the training room the WHOLE FUCKING TIME. it's not like i'm going to wait outside for you in 50 degree weather with flip flops and a t-shirt on. show a little effort.

I think i put too much into the hope that people are trustworthy and will do the right thing, and I  open myself up a little too much, and its a huge letdown when they do something wrong to me. I give a lot, and don't get it back. all the fucking time.

I would say i'm gonna be positive now, but i'm just not having a good day. so i guess i'll just stop bitching and end it there.

I've lived next door to them and for 2 years have not noticed that they have a trampoline...sweet jesus what i've been missing.

I've spent the past hour online looking at livejournals of lesbians who just so happen to also be obsessed with knitting.

AND OH MY GOD DAVID GOT A TATTOO!!!!! AND HE DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT IT!!! he was just over last night and i look at his arm and there it is! i freaked out for like 10 minutes because i was so freaking excited. it says ""alive"" in icelandic and it's pretty sweet. But the best part of it is is that now i can walk up to him and be all ""SWEET TAT MAAAAN"" yea i'm stoked.
Then i was trying to convince my parents to let me get my nose pierced before i turned 18...that was probably the biggest waste of time. 

And my car is being ridiculous. All of a sudden it decided to throw a shit fit and have everything go shitty at once.
I've spent 185 bucks on two new (nice) tires, but now my oil is leaking, and the crack in the windshield is rapidly expanding. MEH.

Things That Are Making Me Happy:
1. David
2. The possibility of Clerks II with Katie and JNet tonight
3. The Mackin' Cheese on the Stove at the moment
4. I Got Paid Today, and it was more than i expected.
5. I'm also getting paid for babysitting twice today
6. I found more concerts i want to go to...yesss...
7. To be materialistic...new clothes

Things that are making me unhappy:
1. Drama
2. The mere thought of conditioning the rest of the week at 7 a.m.
3. The Paycheck i got (mentioned above) was only 48 bucks. ha.
4. The Keene's are taking over my life
5. I'm a tad broke
6. I have no idea what i want to do with my life and the idea of that is making me crazy...i mean you see all these kids who are my age or younger and they're successful doing what they love to do...whether it's make music or movies or golf or whatever, and hell, i don't have that kind of talent, or drive, or passion. It sucks.
7. The whole trend of everyone trying to be original, but actually they're all the same. Rarely do i see someone wearing what they want because that's what they like and want to wear. You'll always have your scenesters say they're doing it, but seriously, they all look the same to me. And they all give me (and Jnet when she comes) the same looks that we don't fit when we go to shows in Howell and stuff. GAH! that's what i say to that.

haha sorry i have a lot of pent up anger. Maybe i should get into boxing or something...

I guess i should leave now, since i've been randomly adding to this post for about 45 minutes between Mac making and eating and watching children and stuff.

On a final note: Jay and Silent Bob are sexy, and i am staging a protest against anime. Sorry David.

"event","My mother is ridiculous. She calls me and tells me to get off her ass when i've only been somewhat close to her for about a half mile because she went from 60 to 40 in about 2 seconds. Then she yells at me for being on the phone when i'm driving, and she was the one who called me. 

My foot has a fucking stress fracture. It hurts like a fucking bitch. Crutches hurt way worse. I hate being so bored and not being able to carry shit and not even being able to shoot around.  
I love not being able to be in shape without swimming. 
I love how I've seen David twice in the past 10 days. 
I love how some people just continue to get to me, even if it's pointless.
I love homework. And having a million tests in one week.
I love when I go to a sweet concert and see sweet people and sweet bands and i have to stay on the balcony. I can really enjoy the fucking show because I've been standing on one foot for about 3 hours straight, and not on the main floor where i'd really like to go but can't because my crutches would get in the way.

Anyone catching my sarcasm?


I'm going to get some food because my mother doesn't believe in feeding me.


and to end on a good note...Love"

"event","Oh man...it's finally April! March is really the worst month for me because it seems to take the longest...but it's finally over!
It's also very early in the morning, and my foot is broken, but we're going bra shopping (too much info...sorry) and everytime i say that it makes me think of Zoolander. I'M NOT YOUR BRA!! hahaha i love that movie.

Yesterday we saw Failure to Launch and it was cute. Then to Angela's for a little party for her bday. And me and JNet are seeing Grease tonight...sweeet.

Oh wow two little kids just electric scootered down my street...that was a little random. haha yesterday before school the little kids next door were up at like, 5. I'm not even kidding. they were outside playing while i was getting in my car to go to school. I want that kind of motivation!


I'm SUPER excited because i may be going to Chicago the last part of Spring Break with a whole bunch of other people who would otherwise be stuck in Pinckney. i'm so effing excited, and i'm hoping we can pull this shit off...

OOO we're leaving!
LOVE and such"

Am.
So.
Ridiculously.
Bored.

I cannot look at myspace anymore. I cannot look at any more purevolume. If i eat something else (i.e. more of the Howard's cookie dough) i will throw it up. Sorry for the graphic nature of that, but it's true.
Currently i'm babysitting, and when Belle wanted ""uppie"" she forgot to mention she had ketchup all over her. Now my badass white Blasters shirt is red. Serves me right for wearing white babysitting, but since when do Belle and Lexi want uppie?
Shit. Now i'm talking in baby talk.

Yesterday was amazing. We saw the 2nd Academy Is.../Panic!/Hellogoodbye show at Clutch, and it was pretty sweet. There was one guy, though, who thought he was much, much smaller than he actually was, and kept crowd-surfing. Over. and over. AND OVER. it was bugging me...especially when he kicked me in the head. NICE! Ha and during the Academy Is i was standing next to this kid in a wool jacket and it kept rubbing on my arm and it was weird.
HELLOGOODBYE PLAYED WELCOME TO THE RECORD which was sweet...because that song makes me happy. And they were even better than they were at The Intersection.
Panic! was pretty sweet too...I think their set seemed longer in Grand Rapids though, because when they were done playing i was kind of surprised. But Panic is always sweet. I'm not complaining.
It was one of the better Academy Shows I've seen. William=love (not because of looks either...) and I loved The Fever. Definitley went a little crazy. 
What's shocking is i spent NO MONEY ON MERCH. I know. My mother almost died of shock. She's still recovering. Not too many pics showed up though...i think i had to get closer. oh well. 
Then Arby's. mmmm. 
Then Family Guy. double mmm.
WHAT A SWEET NIGHT!

I think i'm gonna go do my Poe work...
    BUT SPEAKING OF POE!! We watched this movie to start the Poe unit off and I found out that he married his 13 year-old cousin. Sweet Poe. So Mrs. Zolenski asked us what we thought, and being myself, i said that i thought it was a little weird that he did that. I mean I know that it was a long time ago and I really think he's a genius, but it's weird to me because i couldn't imagine what they'd do together, let alone the whole incest thing. So the aide, who thinks she knows everything about everything says in her most annoying voice ""HE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE HE LOVED HER, HE DID IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO PROTECT THEM...blah blah blah..."" Ok. Sweet...I don't care. HE MARRIED HIS COUSIN. THAT'S ALL I SAID. i don't need input. and i said that, then she gave me a dirty look. HA i love it.

MEAPS suck. My knees suck. And my dad is leaving for a month. SUCKY

I know the whole last part of that was a little bit of a downer, but i'm kind of in a bad mood. I can smell the ketchup on my shirt and it's gross.

Off to American Lit-it up...and in a few hours (when i'm done) i can say ""I Lit it up!"" HAHAHA i'm such a dork...and i really like it.


much LOVE homies"

"event","Currently, I'm at Dan's house typing on his computer while he talks to his mommy, who is an incredibly cute lady if you ask me...
I'm in a really weird mood because i just gave blood and i'm woozy.
Now we're going to Adam's house! WOO!
Howell Battle of the Bands was way, way, wayyyy better than ours. Monte is sweet. So is Boss Ross and Pistol Whip Kelly and Harvey Dent.
AND listening to cool new music (i.e. Brett Scott Symphany Orchestra) in the car with my sick speakers....sick in a bad way
Then i am not looking forward to basketball. BOOO

Ok anyways...we're leaving. This was short...weird

LOVE




P.S FROM DAN:
Dear Readers,
 Carly keeps talking about a picture of Scott and a kid we called Ching Chong.   P.S.S. I picked the mood, and song. Please post comments...
                                          One Love, Daniel"

"event","I'm getting extremely frusterated with people at the moment.
NUMBER ONE:
   Tyler is completely retarded. He got caught drinking WAYYYY too much, and now he's in some deep shit. I feel bad because some of his 'friends' are assholes and tried to put all of the blame on him, but still, he shouldn't have been drinking to thie point that he was drinking to. It was kind of funny though, because I got home from the Monte show (which was sweet) at one in the morning and he's there on the kitchen floor, passed out/sleeping. It was a little weird.

NUMBER TWO:
   I'm getting pissed because I feel like I can't trust some people, and I hate it, because they aren't acting the same to me, and then i act different to them and it's a vicious cycle. I mean i realize that people change, but it's a little sudden. And i hate it when they change for the people who left them. I dunno...i'm just confused.

NUMBER THREE:
   Mrs. LaChance, Mr. Ray, Mrs. Alm, Mrs. Zolenski...why so much homework?

AND MOST OF ALL:
   My fucking gay basketball coach. He specifically told us that if we came to practice and always worked hard, we would earn playing time. I played zero minutes in the first game yesterday. Z.E.R.O. Geo and Mim didn't play either. It's a bit of a waste of my time and money...it's not like i'm paying $500 dollars to sit on a bench right? And it's not like I suck either. I'm sorry i'm not a good shooter when there's three minutes left in the game and you throw me in expecting me to be hot in a gym that has the windows open. Good Call. Even at practice, I am always a sub. It's completely ridiculous.


Anyways...Enought Whining. Off to homework it up...lata.

LOVE"

"event","O.M.G. I have the biggest deadleg of my life at this very moment. Sweet. It feels amazing. I was also elbowed in the face and my lip is cut. OWIE!! Basketball blows. But we won 2 of 3...which isn't bad, and we beat those goddamn Pacers. wooo...

Babysitting is cool too. Like yesterday, for instance. One kid threw up on me, one kid had an accident and is scared of her cat, and one kid wouldn't stop crying, leaving only one perfectly happy, healthy little kid. It was worth it though...60 bucks in one day is okie dokie for me!

ALSO:
YAY David is coming over and i haven't seen him (well...) in a while.
DOUBLE YAY! umm last night was pretty sweet(...aside from the cop scare and the mud on my shoes...but whatever) Jeanette made one of the funniest random comments ever to a cat, and i actually got to sleep in a bed with covers. When does that happen?

Right now the lotion i have on my face is kind of burning...that's not a good sign i don't think.

OH david in the driveway...yessss....

that's all for now really...

"event","Happy Valentine's Day. Wow i'm not typing well today...it took me like a half hour just to get THIS down.

I definitley do not want to eat another piece of candy or brownie for at least a week...because seriously i'm so full! Anyone who hates Valentine's Day because it's too ""commercial"" is just angry at the world. What other holiday celebrates love and urges everyone to bring candy and treats to school? I mean halloween is great too...but that was a while ago! They can't be angry at that! Now you could if perhaps you have a thing where you don't like candy (weird...) or sugar (again...)AND you don't have a valentine,i can see your frustration. but i've never met anyone like that. 
It's ok to totally be secretly jealous of all the girls that get like, a million roses at the office, and remember that i love you.
i just can't afford all the roses.
Besides, who wants roses anyways? A few are sweet every once and a while, but they die! I like my 2, but a dozen? what? that's like, 30 bucks too! You could buy a badass soft blanket and a CD for that much...
I'm also a huge fan of Power Ranger valentines too...

haha i think i've over-analyzed valentines day enough.

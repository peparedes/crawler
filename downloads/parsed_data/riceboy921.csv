not as fun as last year... though there were some better moments

jaimie wasnt there first off.  that pretty much sucked butt.  it was a slow slow start to a comparitavely uneventful trip.  last year was so much more fun.  o man... but yeah.  u were sorely missed jaim.  dani came :)  that was a plus. of course.  the maxair was by far my favorite ride.  it was like being a drunk superman. holy cow that was fun.  lol.  did some little kiddy rides, and died in the heat.  i pretty much sweated all of the water that was in my body.  o man... i hate sweating.  so gross.  no millenium force.  we were too lazy to wait in line.  jerks.  o well... o yeah... i GOT A NEW FREAKING SWEET LAPTOP!! side note there...  i'm using it right now actually.  its sooooo sweet.  anyways.  church tonight... should be fun.  yay! ok... bye!"

"event","wow... so both of us get hit hard.  both of us are given a wake up call.  both of us are both put in situations that totally suck.  its like a nightmare that never ends.  u wanna wake up out of it... but nothing happens.  ur just stuck.  stuck in the worst possible scenario.  all you can ask is y?  y God?  why now?  of all times?  just when i'm having the time of my life?  what are u doing?! why are u screwing with my life?  

the thing is though... we both know that God is sovereign.  we both know that everything has a purpose in his perfect plan.  it just sucks to think that all of this bad... is actually for our good in some way.  we cant see it now,  but maybe God's preparing us for something... maybe he's protecting us.  he's waking us up from our childhood and getting us ready for all the real trials and stupidities that are to come.  ""i know this hurts... i just hope this may help in the end.  this is the only way i know to help you.  i love you.""  that's what he's saying.  ""you'll understand in the end"" our only job is to listen.  to listen to what he's trying to say, to what he's trying to do.. accept it because there isnt any other thing we can do... and then try to piece together our lives and move on.  

i dk... maybe this helped.  i'm here for you.  i love you, u know that right?"

open house was fun...got muchos money/towels? what?  lol yeah... towels and body cleaning stuff... that's awesome! i'll be nice and fresh and clean in college! yeah! hmm.. tuesday... dani came over and we watched peter pan! that was pretty sweet... wednesday... sat at home, went to the dermo, got some wicked sweet sunblock, went to the awana carnival.  pretty fun.  then we hit up cafe mocha for the first time ever! definitely the new hang out spot.  that place is amazing!  thursday... baked cookies with dani :) and mark and kristen and shattana... but o well.  i still got to spend time with my dani! couldnt make it to eka's... sigh.  next time though...next time.  (eka- u just gotta hit me up earlier!)  k neways... friday was craziness.  i went to the awards day at school, played some soccer, gave colin his cookie...then came home for a bit.  shimmied over to doug's to pick up him, sean, and phil then drove to davison.  fun stuff.  the service was so freaking long though! and they had some weird candle lighting ceremony...  said hi to all the ppl we knew, then hung out at the stott's and the baudoux's.  drove home in the construction barrel filled road that is I-75 and got home at 1.  mom wasnt happy lol... today- went to jaime's open house, tiff's open house, and the athens graduation.  o my word that school is huge!  about 500 graduates! that took forever to hand out their diplomas! GAH! then went to red lobster with our friends, and then watched the pistons game at christians.  yeah pistons! 3-3 my friends... pistons party neone?? not at my house though... just putting that out there.

hit up olive garden, caught up on the last two weeks, went to walgreens (bleh), target, dentist appointment lol, got some really good ice cream and then the soccer game.  the girls won!! woo! one more game... we went to eat at wendy's after, and i got a big bacon classic with extra bacon.  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... yummy.  that's the first fast food i've eaten in so long.

i'm so tired... and i still have to drive my sibs to school tomorrow.  even after i've been ironing, and such for like 2 hours.  i'm about to die

i still need to practice for recital, and write a speech.  grrrr..."

"event","i have a dilemma... i'm going off to college next year, to south carolina.  that's crazy far away.  i know its going to be amazing for me, and that i'll be able to learn a lot and grow a whole bunch.  But things have started coming up that make me not want to leave home... i want to be home and make more of an impact on my friends here.  for quite some time now i've been wanting to start a bible study or a teen thing...something where ppl can get together and hangout, talk about God and His impact on their lives, and just encourage each other in the faith.  i dk, i really think it would make a huge impact on ppl. 

dani...o man.  i dk...too much stuff to write...

but then on the other hand...what if i need to go to bju so i can be better prepared for all these plans?? i really dont feel ready to start a bible study on my own.  i wish i had someone who would keep me accountable, someone to push me to do my best in college, to help me stay focused on the future and the more important things in life.  when girls come into my life, i need someone to smack me and keep me on the right path, not to get all caught up in my feelings and what i want for the moment... too much more...dont want to write it all...


no comments needed...just wanted to get that all out..."

"event","alright, so jaimie told me to update..

well saturday i went to my eighth grade reunion...kinda lame.  i got there and there was only like 10 ppl there.  we played a little bball then jetted over to kayla's house to sit and talk since it was freezing cold.  watched our school play lol...fun stuff

then drove a million miles cuz i had to drop ppl off

sunday was alright, went to church, choir practice...THEN we went to the SNAC! so much fun :)  ate some nachos, talked, made a song lol... i'm amazing at the guitar (right...)

after we messed around in the parking lot lol.  that was really fun.  i love my youth group!  me and jaimie broke up...sigh... o well, now i'm free to pursue tiff :) lol jk.  she dumped me even after i scratched her eyeball! i freaking touched it!! 

(for all those not a part of the youth group...me and jaimie were never actually going out...therefore, do not get worried and start gossiping to dani :) lol)

monday... i found out i have asthma! GAH! that's what's been slowly killing me... i have 5 meds i have to take now and 2 inhalers!! 2!  well then i called dani and talked to her for like 5 hours! lol no not really..it was more like 1, but it was late at night, and i was drugged up, and it seemed like a really really long time :)

stayed home from the soccer game today...and then i missed the ethnic day at athens...all cuz i'm freaking sick!!  much sadness..."

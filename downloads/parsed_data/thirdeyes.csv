"event","Who's up for a little discussion?  After the idiots of sparknotes, I realize that I prefer our discussions here...
anyway, reading Xurg's last entry and the exerpt of mine on our bio reminded me of a long something I wrote in our black book last year about love.  I distinctly remember saying that at the time I was incapable of it which also launched Susan into lecturing me.  Susan, I'm afraid you were right afterall- one must open up.  After having done so, I realized that so many of my views on life and love have changed.  Now that Christen has found that too, I must ask, what are our opinions of love now?

"event","Therapists, eh? Well, I think they are full of shit. However, I've never had the pleasure of seeing one before. But I think it will be easier if I just go along with the rest of them and judge therapists without a basis or reason. So, according to me (and my opinion is fact) Therapists are poopy heads."

"event","Parents: 

They were teenagers once.  Yes, about 20 years ago.  They know exactly what we're going through.  But guys and girls are different, very different, dad's don't know daughters, and moms don't know sons.  They didn't have friends exactly like ours...frankly they didn't exist back then.  What about this one.  When dad calls you by mothers name as an insult...even when they were still 'in love'.  Or, once they've divorced, calls you by mothers name, and doesn't realize it.  How is this sinero supposed to be taken?  Were they even in that situation?  

Therapists: 

What do you think of them?  Are they good for people, or not?  Explain please."

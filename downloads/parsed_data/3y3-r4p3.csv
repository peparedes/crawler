"event","hello all, i recently started to watch a cartoon well i guess its a cartoon... anyways its at homestarrunner.com.  i suggest that everyone and anyone who reads about my life here should go and check the website out.  anyways back to the update i started and finished a summer school class, met a new person, got really sunburned at the beach, then met another person, and to top it all off my wisdom teeth are coming in.  so im pretty much a walking wound.  hopefully this sunburn thing will susbside soon and the teeth thing, well i want to get them pulled but i have a fear of needles... its alright tylenol is only 5.96 for 50 tablets thats like what .14 a pill so 3 pills every 5 hours or 12 pills a day that will last just under 5 days so i will need 6 bottles a month which is like 38.00 and only 456.00 a year... im gonna stop rambling and go make an appointment to get my teeth pulled.  i mean honestly do you know what you can buy with 456.00... a lot of gummy bears.  damn i cant wait for those gummy bears."

"event","so i like to write this stuff i guess. and when i read my journal of december i had to chuckle. only because as i see i was right yet again it is april almost may and ill be 20 wow a whole 20. and as i already stated about being alone i was right. it is a good 4 months later and nothing has changed. well besides me becoming a whole lot more bitter than before nothing else has really changed. hmmm oh yea i moved out of my house i forgot to mention that. i got out of there and now live in an apartment with 4 other guys soon be 3 and that is pretty nice. im close to campus as you probably figured out due to the fact i bought a bike. do you know what else really pisses me off. women. like i could sum up most of my worldy problems to one thing. women. they are the reason that men do most of what they do. if not the reason we do everything. i mean seriously why do we make money? to spend on women. why do we work out? to look good for women. why do we dress they way we dress? to impress women. all i gotta say to women is that you are all evil in your own ways. don't try to deny it and if you don't think your evil then you must not be trying hard enough. haha just look deep inside yourself its there just waiting to be unleashed. good luck."

"event","so it has been like what a crap load of time since i updated this wonderful masterpiece i call life. so lets see what is worth while to mention. hmmm i guess i will start with i got the crap scared out of me by a psycho fat chick. she screamed at me and i nearly beat her over the head with my flashlight haha that would have been great. ummm oh yea today i saw atreyu today at my school two of my freinds drove from their school to mine to see it with me it was alright they aren't my favorite band in the world. oh yea i got a new bike as well on sunday. set me back a good 5 bills but hey i need to get into shape and save gas money anyways. so i have a new interest in my life its a game, a game i play all too often and with so many people. i wish for once this one wouldn't have the same ending as the rest but alas it will. hmmm to all of those out there that understand what that means im sorry that you know. haha great. well i have done enough ranting for now. maybe i will be a little better at updating this. eh no promises."

"event","so yea today was my brothers b-day party that was fun i guess. hmmm yea i havent updated this piece of crap in a while so i guess i will. i went to hisperia and or victorville dont really know where i was. then again i dont ever really know where i am but that doesnt really matter. so yea as always i go home alone every night so why should this night be an exception. my brother and all of his freinds have a girl down there and i am upstairs with my friend the computer which by the way is a fucking piece of shit that breaks all the time. but anyways im glad christmas is over time for new years. time for all the fat people to go on diets, all the smokers to quit, and all the alcoholics to quit beating their wives and children ... i mean quit drinking thats right thats what i meant. how long can these things be like if i keep typing will this page ever fill up or will it just let me keep babbeling on and on. hmmm i dunno i guess ill never know becasue i really dont have that amount of time on my hands what with being bored and having nothing to do. yea so now im pretty much done im gonna go in my room and sleep and when i wake up everything will ofcourse still be shit. but at least its a new day."

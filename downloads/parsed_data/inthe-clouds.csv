The only good things about yesterday was that I bought incense and hair color! My hair is going to be light brown instead of black!! Yaaaaay. Good times.



Oh, and my neck is swollen. Grrrrr."

"event","So, what does a 15 year old girl do with her Friday evening? She looks up a book to read! What? Excuse me? Did you say <B>NERD</B>? Haha, I don't blame you! Believe me.

I'm going to buy <u>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</u> Mitch Albom. I know someone has suggested this book but I am forgetting who.



Anyway, I took an online IQ test and I have an IQ of 108, which is average. The test said I was a ""Visual Mathematician."" This is very true, I am always in need of a visual.

"event","I have read four books so far this year. I know I can get an easy A+ in English but somehow I am getting a D. I know that I am probably <i>one</i> of the better reader's in my class. I don't like to do silly worksheet's. I just want to read the book.



Kids, at the school. I watch them struggle with their teachers to get a passing grade. I watch them smiling when they get an A. I know they care about their future. They care about it so much they go home and smoke pot or get drunk with their friends.



I respect my English teacher, Mr. Talbot. Because he still has life in him, unlike the other teachers. He motivates me to actually remember that not everyone is a complete idiot. 



I have wanted to become an English teacher my entire life. What holds me back is fear. Fear of burning out. Fear of being hated. Fear of having to teach people who do not want to be teached."

Nothing important is really going on with my life right now. I'm struggling to fight against my eating disorder, thoughts of my mother, getting sick, not getting enough sleep. I have missed two days of school due to no sleep and terrible stomach aches. I plan on going tomorrow, the real purpose for me going is to ask Josh to buy me a carton of cigarettes. Well, to also go to English and Healthy Choices. Those are honestly the only classes I can stand.

How is that I can read four books in less than two months but I can't keep up with my English book, To Kill A Mockingbird? It's not very interesting, really. I have 4-5 chapters to read by tomorrow and I don't see how this is going to happen. I don't even know how many chapters to read. I should just read up to chapter 20. Blah, blah, blah.


I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I just feel like a burden."

"event","The week has been molding itself into one solid 168 hour ""day"". Get up, read, do this, read, this, read, this, read, that, read, this, read, that. Read, go to bed. Get up, read, do this, read, this, read, this, read, that, read, this, read, that.

In two days I have successfully read <i>Running With Scissors</i>. What a fantastic book! I plan on reading <i>Dry</i> next.

You could say I have finally gone mad. Or you could say I was bored. But I made cookies for my family. At 8 PM. It was fun, though. Sadly, it wasn't the kind you mold. It was pre-molded. Ha, so I have 48 Valentine cookies on the counter and I bet by tomorrow afternoon they'll be gone. I think I might bring some to school and give them to friends. I'm not sure.

I already took my medicine and I'm extremely tired, goodnight.

Always,
Kristen"

Last night I got in a huge fight with my step-mom because I calld her my  ""step-mom."" Which makes sense because she IS.

I can't go to Justin's after school anymore unless his mom is there or someone over 20, I guess. She thinks I'll get pregnant or something, which is stupid because I'm not like that. Maybe I can take the pill and everything will be okay. I still have to think about it.

I really need a cigarette, I really, really do. Goddamn. Josh said that he could get me some but I feel bad asking him because I didn't go to his little gig. I didn't want to go, actually and niether did Justin or Chris. So we just didn't go.

"event","Oh, man. Today hasn't been too good.

In first period it was just boring and dull. We watched this movie on the ocean and it scared me. I'm deathly afraid of the ocean and deep water.

Second period we had that jackass sonofabitch substitute who thinks all woman are shallow. Oh, and he voted for Bush. Enough said, I guess. But Andrew gave me a donut which was nice. I don't know, I enjoyed the donut.

Third period was better than first and second. I always enjoy seeing Mr. Talbot. I was such a nerd because I was dissapointed we didn't read for the first 15-20 minutes of class. Haha, wow. I'm such a nerd.

I hung out with my boyfriend at lunch, ate chips, drank soda. Blah blah blah! He's going to Arizona or something this weekend and I'll be so so so so bored without him!

Healthy Choices is what got me in such a bad mood. We talked about poisoning and then we moved on to ipecac and self induced vomiting. I was bulimic. I recently got out of recovery but it stills makes me so sad to think about it. The ipecac reminded me of Meghan, a woman who used to be in the recovery program with me. It's so incredibly sad because she almost died from overdosing on ipecac.

P.E and Algebra were both boring. Nothing went on.

When I got home it turned out my wonderful step mother forgot to leave the gate unlocked so I couldn't get in the house because she was gone. So she came home and let me in and I was so angry with her I couldn't even speak. She then gave me terrible news that this little girl I knew was in a fire. She almost died and the people forgot her in the house that was on fire. She had to get herself out, all by herself and she's only 10-11. She's fine but she has nightmares about fires and she see's fires everywhere. It's so sad.

I called my boyfriend to vent and cry and scream and yell. But he was busy and I didn't want to bother him. Which made me cry even more and blah everything is a mess today.

That's all, I guess.

Always,
Kristen"

"event","It's so fantastic to have someone love you. To wrap their arms around you and you feel so protected. It's amazing and beautiful and it's so hard to describe. You feel like you're floating on air and you're looking down at the whole world and you laugh at them because they are not having this wonderful expierence.

I have been in school now for two weeks. It's great to be surrounded by people you don't even know. I feel like I'm doing something with my life. I like all of my teachers. Especially Mr. Talbot. He's not only very good looking, but he is intelligent and he is the best English teacher I have ever had.

P.E is boring because all Robert, Briana and their group talks about drugs. Mainly pot. It's stupid and I usually hang around by myself but sometimes it get's really lonely so I feel like I have no other choice. Robert is very desperate to get my to try pot, but honestly I don't want to.


Oh, I am very excited to start this journal because I feel that I'm going to be using this for a long time. I have so much to tell everyone and I want to share it with everyone.

Always,
Kristen"

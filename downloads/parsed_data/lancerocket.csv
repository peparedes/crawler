"event","I barely even log onto Furc anymore. I remember when Furc was just starting out and my brother and I got on. We were greeted by some chick named Sylvea Moon and her boyfriend Mental Man. My colors were an uncoordinated mess and I wanted wings more than anything. The left side of the screen was just brown, and there weren't any buttons to make it easier, you had to learn every command. We had no clue how to make a halfway decent dream, had no idea what to do, and had no idea that we would make so many friends. Sylvea Moon became like, my best friend. xD In all.. I sort of miss the awe that Furc gave me 4 years ago. Now it seems like some sort of distant memory, but in all honesty I sometimes wish that it was the way it was way back when. I guess I'm just living in the past."

"event","Oh man did that hurt. I just got this thing in my neck (That I seem to be the only one who gets them.).. It hurts so bad. It's like, if I twist my neck the wrong way,  I like dislocate it or something.. While it's trying to get back in place or whatever, my throat closes.. EVERYTHING hurts, breathing irritates it, speaking is bad, and don't even think about swallowing. I would think if I were to cough in this state of being I'd die. e.e; It only lasts 3 minutes, but it definitely feels like it's a lot longer. x.x; Things are getting so out of hand. I almost finished my summer project today, making the best figures I've made with clay in my entire life. I felt good afterwards.. However, my dad got a little out of hand today.. I brushed his pool once... Twice.. Then he called me out a third time, cursing and screaming so bad he got red in the face. In the middle of his ranting, I yanked the brush head off of the pole and dove into the pool clothes and all and brushed the little bit of impossible-to-reach green up by hand before resurfacing. He was looking at me all strange, and I was soaked, but I didn't hear from him again all day. God I was pissed off. Something that I can't talk about openly has been bothering me lately.. So bad that it's taking over my life.. I can't complete simple tasks.. Like.. Putting in my contacts.. Which has been second nature since I was like 10.. Takes me 15 minutes all of a sudden.. Brushing my teeth is complicated and eating is a chore. I don't get it.. I need to get rid of this."

And! Kitarii! Happy birthday to YOU. Cause I won't BE here. But I love you too. Sure, if it weren't for Reese you'd probably be just another hoochy bitch who hangs out in New Haven, but I met you so now you're one of my bestest friends.

Why doesn't this shit happen to me? Oh wait, it does, and then I get left behind. -.- Read this. (I only editted the names so that the person won't get flamed. )

Lance Rocket: I don't get it.
M: What is there not to get? He doesn't love you Lance. He wouldn't leave you if he loved you. 
M: It's time to face facts, dude... He's not coming back. He hates you. Get over it.. 
Lance Rocket: Why would he tell me otherwise then?
M: Because he doesn't want to hurt you. But dude, it's true. Who's ever  honestly loved you?..
Lance Rocket: ....

Heh.. Wow.. Feeling loved. The saddest part of this is that it's true.. I've loved many.. But I never get the love in return.. What's the use any longer? Why love?

Another note, other people who were idiots to me tonight can all kiss my ass. You know who you are, and I'll have no problem notifying you about whether or not you're one of them if you're wondering. Dicks. >\.. And thank you for warding one off, Jonno. =)"

"event","Well.. The weekend was as boring as expected. First the 4 hour car trip to her house confined as close as humanly possible to my family. (No it was not enjoyable.) When we FINALLY arrived, I realized that they were short one bed. o.o; Guess who got to sleep on the floor. o.o; Jagged, concrete floor. No, Not enjoyable. x.o;

The next day, I was dragged to a ""beach."" It was more packed than the Jersey shore which I thought unhumanly possible, but I suppose I was wrong because this one was like.. Eating somebody else's elbows in 10909 degree weather. Fun. There was ONE highlight to it. I don't know if this is customary in New York as it is in Switzerland, but while staring out into the lake with a bored look on my eyes a bunch of young guys ran up to the water in their clothes. They stripped completely naked in front of everybody and lingered around a little ( I think one knew I was looking. o.o; ) before jumping into the water. Wow. o.o; But uhh.. They came back out and that one who I think knew I was looking was the only one who stayed... But I won't go into details about that one. o.o; Yeah, later on that night I told everybody that I was going for a nice ""walk in the country"".. And I hightailed it over to Cooperstown where Cryssy's club was to surprise her and such. It took some twisting and some bothering a bouncer but he let me in under ""family conditions"". Anyway, Crystal sang and didn't know I was there and all. She sings nice. =) But uhh.. After that was the funny part. I went backstage surprised the shit out of her and then went to sitting on the backstage bench and hitting on all of the dancers, because, they were... HOT.. <3.<3; And lmao.. Here was the funny part... Crystal went out to get something from her car on the crowded main street.. She had dug in her purse for a while because I'd taken her first set of keys to confuse her, not knowing she had an extra set. So she unlocked her car with the button and right after that, I hit the lock button on the set I had. She kept unlocking it and then I would lock it. She finally looked up and glared at me and then I snickered and hit the panic button so her car alarm would go off. Needless to say, people stopped and stared at her like she was a retard. When I finally let her get the car door open, I set off the alarm again. Funny. e.e; I got smacked too. But yeah. I didn't get to linger and chat much longer because I had to hightail it  home. I don't think any of them had a clue. Cool.

And today. Another ride in the car. Yay. The real thing that bothers me lately though occurred before we left, after my last journal entry. When my  parents argue, the whole neighborhood knows, for my mother is LOUD. So when I heard her say, ""In our Family"" and ""junkie"" in the same sentence, I got suspicious and decided to hang around the bottom of the steps to get a better view of what was going on. In doing so, I found out that my own uncle.. A man who has been with me since my birth and who I've always trusted since as far as I can remember does drugs habitually.. It's the reason for his financial trouble.. I mean.. I could have never suspected somebody so close to me guilty of the one thing that I could end my relationship with somebody for.. But.. In this case how can I even let him know my anger? I can't not talk to him, because I suppose he has no clue that I know.. But I can never look at him the same way.. bring myself to look up to him anymore... It's a sad world I live in.. When I can't even trust my family members to be clean anymore.."

"event","Well time for that dreaded weekend at my aunt's that I was complaining about a couple of days ago. Yeah.. But, I'm going to call Crystal's home phone cause it's a local number and her mom won't get suspicious and see if I can hit her club. =P. Awesome. But.. Other than that. Shitty. Bleh. I'll miss all. Hope all will miss me. =)"

"event","Today, I actually talked to a lot of people.. And it's kind of really unhappy actually. Just talking to everybody and seeing how much they've changed since I first met them... It was 3 years ago that I first discovered the internet... It was 3 years that I met all of my old friends... Here or gone... Most gone... And it's kind of sad. We all used to be such children.. Now they've all grown up and become so much more mature, and it seems like I'm the only one who got left behind. Still a child. Missing out on life, because I'm so naive and blind to so much stuff.

While babysitting Satan's children, I sat online and talked to people. And talked. And talked. And talked. So many people tell me that they look up to me, that they think I'm really something else.. That they actually *worship* me. I don't understand this at all. Of all the people you should never look up to, you should never look up to me. All you guys are all so great and so amazing at like everything, why would you look up to me who's just.. not?

Anyway, that wasn't even the saddest part of my day. I remember how I was even more naive last year... Guys... All of my old friends.. I want you to think.. Think back to last year.. When we used to all sit at the pond.. Everyday, the pond would be full to capacity, so full, that many seats on the ground with and without pillows were taken because there wasn't enough seats for us. There was never any asking, ""Have you seen"" or ""Where has ? been"" because we were always so well informed.. The closest of friends.. Every single night we would sit and talk and joke and laugh and just have a great time.. It was amazing. I considered everybody here to be like brothers, closer than anybody I knew IRL.. Closer than everything that I ever loved.. I mean, I was at the point of naivity where I thought we would stay this way forever. Meet IRL. Have fun. But no, none of that ever happened.. We fell apart, and look at us now. Spend ONE entire day at the pond and maybe 3 people who used to be there all day will show up for 4 minutes. It's just depressing... Everybody's went their separate ways.. Everybody's different, new friends, new interests. Am I the only one who misses it? Am I the only one who even thinks of it anymore. I mean, I mention some things that we used to do people and they go, ""What?"" ""Huh?"" ""I don't remember."" You've all forgotten.. Forgotten what great friends we used to be.. And it's a shame. =\

Sanguis continues to work hard for my journal's betterment. Thankies. =)

I think I've lost Tristan again.. He's disappeared yet again... Or... He just doesn't care and is avoiding me or whatever... Do I honestly deserve this? I mean... I thought he actually loved me... What's the matter with me?"

"event","LMFAO. This logfile is SO great, it is the funniest shit that has ever happened to me on Furc. Ok, My friends and I are starting up a Final Fantasy 7 thing, and we were making up creative names for the characters. So we got to Tifa and I suggested ""The Slutty Bartender"" Followed by the suggestion of ""Cum Guzzling Whore"". So, Sure enough, I made the name Cum Guzzling Whore (with hearts between every letter in the bad words.). She must've been the most shortlived Furcadian character ever. Here's the log. LMAO.

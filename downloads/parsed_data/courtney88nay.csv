"event","So today i go my progress report, I'm failing hitory. It doesn't really make sense to me how, but whatever, Mr.Helmreich sucks anyways. But I have an A in sociology, a B in chemistry and a C in Marine Biology! :) haha.. yup. In sociology right now we're watching ""Dead man walking""... it's a good movie so far! and in history we just started watching schindler's list. annnyways, had a nice talk with pete tonight! He gives good advice, so thank you to Pete Lebrun for reminding me not to rush high school! haha :) But even though I'm excited for college since I really want to meet a bunch of new people, I want to stay here and just go back to last year, becuase i think sophomore year was definitely the best so far. All the awesome seniors, easy classes haha..Oh well! Time to move on! Guys lately, SUCK..seriously lol. Can someone please explain to me why girls feel like they have to stop their boyfriend from talking to his friends? Is it jealousy? or what? It doesn't make sense to me.. People need to get over their insecurities, and not even deny that they have any because obviously being a controlling girlfriend is because they feel insecure and think they need to isolate their boyfriend from the other girls of the world so nobody steals him. It's so annoyingly stupid. Lets just all be friends! lol.. I finally get to hang out with my cousin tomorrow night! We went from being best friend and hanging out almost every weekend..to basically never talking. It's weird how once you hit puberty everything changes hahaha ;) Well I'm bored with this now so Good night people! Have an awesome weekend!!!"

"event","Wow! So It's been a little while since I updated. Absolutely nothing has happened. Went on a field trip during first block today to the SEWERAGE place.. that was a blast i must admit. NOT haha it smelled really gross. Being mean to Tberry was funny though, until he decdied to be a JERK and say im always mean to him even though amanda and allegra are more mean than I am. Yup..History always sucks because my teacher's DUMB and I really don't like him. I think he must've done a lot of drugs when he was younger because he's sooo out of it all the time. It annoys me so much. If you're going to be a teacher, maybe you should atleast know what you're doing. Oh well, I'll survive! So after school i sat around at home and then went to the store with amanda to get some lunch for tomorrow. We're going to Wells Reserve with our marine bio class, so that should be an adventure. OH and on the way back to school from the sewer place, amanda tried strangling me..repeatedly. It wasn't cool I was choking. Then she had to play the ""you can't do anything, im not touching you"" game, which i HATE because i can't stand people putting their hands in my face but whenever she does it I can't help but laugh. After that, we started telling people about how over the summer, when me and manda would be swimming in her pool she'd MAKE me pull her around..while her hands were like around my neck, and if i didn't stand up straight she tickled me. It wasn't fun...trying to swim while laughing really hard doesn't work. Anyways, tomorrow's going to be cool, because I get to miss school..again, but I can't even go all the way down on the beach or something because my teacher said there's ticks? and if you know me..you know im petrified of them for some strange reason. Yup well..that was about my day! Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did...haha :) 


Thought this was funny so I have to put it in here for the world to read---

"event","So! having a license is pretty cool. Tonight I hung out with Amanda Almond..we went to return 4 massive bags of bottles that I had, and filled up my gas tank. The bad thing though..is that one of the bags, someone in my family who's obviously not too smart (ricky) threw trash in one of the bags and it had been there for a while so it smelled REALLY bad and was all nasty. We had to take them back to amanda's grandparent's house and wash them off with a hose..then we went to hannaford and returned those ones. So now! The gas tank is full :) For probably the first time in a while. After that we went to wal-mart and got manda some posterboard and toilet paper and construction paper! haha.. She made me carry the toilet paper.. So then we went to Villa Capri..talked to DAN..and walked him up to villa capri from aroma joes and I got an application cause I'm awesome like that. This guy at the bar..wearing a pink shirt smiled at me haha he was like balding... It was a little creepy. Manda and I just decided to go home after that because we're doing something tomorrow I think and there wasn't really anything else left to do anyways so..yeah. That was my night. :) Pretty exciting huh? lol..yup..anyways..time to go cause this is boring now. LATER!"

"event","So to start off my day..Travis didn't even get out of bed until 7..then he decided to take a shower while Ricky and I just stood around waiting. I came so close to driving myself there but I didn't wanna screw stuff up since I'm going to hopefully get my license tomorrow anyways! *HOPEFULLY* haha annnyways, we got there, and i talked to Lori for a few minutes then found man! I started telling her this story about when i was younger and i went to the pet store to save some turtles from a tank..but then i realized that it never even happened..I just watched it on Rugrats one time lmao. That was pretty interesting. We got to go down to good old 'stump pond' as everyone calls it and collect friggen water samples. I wasn't even supposed to go because I didn't turn in my permission slip form but I went anyways. =) Being the cool kid that I am. I ended up falling in when we got to the pond place and i got pushed down that stupid little waterfall... hahah jk that didn't happen, I didn't even go near the water. Sociology was pretty boring, we didn't even do much at all. Then I went to the library for advisory and alll the way there i was freaking out because I left my keys in my desk in the sociology portable. I had to go all the way back and mrs.nicholson ended up stopping me and asking where I was going. Wow do I honestly look like the type of person to be skipping a class? noooope! 3rd block kind of sucked..I didn't do anything, at all, except for listening to my classmates argue about the U.S. being like nazis or some crap like that? it was entertaining....4th block i got to be partners with the COOLEST kid in the world. Bunna Ros! :) lol..where would I be without him? So yeah..I came home and talked to this really HOT kid for like 5 minutes cause he's way too cool for me. Thennn I went driving for a while with my madre. And now...here i am! so yup..that was my day :)"

"event","Had our first day of school! It wasn't even as good as I expected..my classes aren't too bad, except for sociology..which im not too excited about because it's full of like..17 seniors and 3 other juniors..and the only senior that I know is TJ..not that it's bad, because i LOVE TJ :) But.. I hate presenting things to classes, and tomorrow when I present my thingy it's gonna suck. But whatever I'll get over it. Tberry's definitely my aid again in marine bio haha. Won't be the same as art class but it'll still be awesome. So yeah..going for my license wednesday :) wish me luck! haha I'm definitely gonna need it since some of us just can't grasp the concept of parallel parking lol. Hung out with Allegra today..it would have been so much better had I not felt like I wanted to curl up and die the whole time. haha I was so sick :( But on the plus side.. I got to feed some goats!! They were cute lol they had these stubby tails that they were wagging :) Then!! Allegra's mom went down this big slide, and fell at the bottom lol it was sad, but still funny. I atleast helped her up! Cause I'm awesome like that. There was a rabbit, and my little brother was fascinated with the fact that it would bite a stick... I'd probably bit a stick if someone stuck it in my face too and i didn't know wtf was going on.. anyways! I'm kinda tired..and feel like laying down..so yeah, ;) later"

"event","Yesterday was really boring..I woke up at like 11 or 12 and played some mario..haha then i really didn't do much at all. Went to shaw's with my mom and saw ashley drouin and amanda scarponi! That was pretty cool.. then I saw Sarah, who was all excited to be on her lunch break hahah :) gotta love her! I didn't end up going to bed until like 2 because SOMEONE asked me to stay up cause they'd be back in a little bit..lol, oh well whatever, I'm over it. But all night I kept smelling weed..it was weird. And DONT tell me it was my parents because I know for a fact it wasn't..lol..Anyways..Tonight I'm going to the movies with Allegra and Carolyn? and some other people to see napoleon dynomite! :) So right now I think I'm gonna go and find something to do until it's time to get ready.."

"event","Today, when i went shopping..the cashier was REALLY hot, haha. It was great. He couldn't find the price on a pair of my pants so he just charged 5 dollars for them. I thought it was pretty cool. When we got home my mom made me go driving..she got all mad because I couldn't offset back. As if I'm ever going to have to when I have my license... I can always just go find somewhere else to park! While she was making me drive around I had to go into this weird place for her to make a payment, and there was another really, REALLY hot guy there. I'm pretty sure he wanted me... hahah just kidding. Well maybe he did but oh well. So last night I had a dream about a baby chick! It was so incredibly adorable!!! It was little and yellow/brown and really fuzzy..and when I called it, it would come to me lol. It's feet were made of weird stuff though, it was like the stuff on the bottom of a cat's foot, but then it felt like suede kinda? Anyways! When I squeezed it's foot..it would squeeze my hand back lol. Aww... I wish it was real :) SO! to finish this off.. I love travis berry because he's my best friend..lol..."

"event","-To the person I had an argument with last night.. I really don't regret anything I said..I think it was all just stuff I needed to say before, but didn't have the guts to. I do feel bad about all the stuff that has happened to you but I have problems of my own, I don't need to be worrying about other people all the time...

Manda said my journal sucked because I didn't tell everyone how I went to massachusettes the other day with her and met her grandparents. They're really nice..her grandmother laughs..a LOT haha..it's cool though. Cheery older people are awesome. Her grandfather's so cute hah and loud! We talked to nick.. wasn't the best conversation I've ever had...It's kinda dumb how people can just drop their friends for a girlfriend..or boyfriend, whatever the case may be. Anyways! Besides that manda and I had fun.. we went to the beach too. It was pretty interesting..lol.. these big waves kept going by, and the bottom of her bathing suit ended up getting untied..nobody saw anything though because it was underwater! My boob popped out to say hello and I didn't even notice for a few seconds haha.. We were eating lunch on the jetty, and this old guy behind us had his umbrella blow away.. it was sad. But when he went to go pick it up his chair tipped over hahahahhahaha...I know it's mean but if you had seen it you would've laughed too. Then! the old guy behind us was swearing at bugs that were flying around him, but yet we were only like five feet in front of him and i didn't see any bugs. Kinda makes you wonder.... ? I didn't even get much of a tan but oh well, I don't care. That's what living in maine does to you.. Anyways! That was about it I think.. :) Another fun weekend at manny's house! later peeps ;)"

I started packing up more of my room today. I am glad that more is getting done because I put it off for so long. I don't really have too much time to be screwing around. I have 5 days to finish up all of my packing and pack for Rhode Island. I have a family reunion to go to on the 21st. Luckily we are flying because I cannot possibly imagine driving there and then coming home only to pack up and drive to Western the next day. I am going to be even more stressed out as the days go on. I am trying to remain calm and optimistic about the whole thing but I am finding that hard to do. There is a huge pile of crap in the family room right now that I will be taking with me. My mom found out that she cannot rent a u-haul because there is some kind of lawsuit going on with Firestone that also has to do with Ford Explorers. I guess there were too many accidents involving them or something and that is the only vehicle that cannot be used to pull a u-haul. Well that is the only car that has a trailer hitch on it so we are shit out of luck. Or my mom is just going to have to borrow her friend's Yukon. That would really help. I just cannot get over how much I have to take. I decided that it would be kind of nice to have a couch to sit on, something other than our beds. We won't even have enough room to sit up straight on our beds. So I am bringing part of the old sectional that used to be in our living room. I don't know how we are going to fit that in our van. Yeah so I have this to worry about and then making sure that I have everything done. 

I started shopping for some clothes for school and then got aggravated because I had to take my brother and he gave me hell the whole entire time. So that put me in an ugly mood. 

My dad is coming home tomorrow. Well actually, he is coming home later today. That'll be nice because I haven't seen him in over 2 weeks. When he gets back I am gonna have to have him help me pick out a digital camera. All I know is I need a decent one for around $200. And of course nothing too complicated."

"event","My mother has been getting on my nerves lately about the same annoying stuff. I am sick and tired of hearing it from her. She is the reason why I feel like shit all the time. She makes me feel like no matter what I do I will never be able to look the way she wants me to. I know I shouldn't be caring about what she thinks. She is worried about what I could potentially do to myself next year. I worry about it too but I know that I have control over myself and my actions. I am not happy with myself as it is so why would I fuck it up? I am done with this shit. She is the one that is contradicting herself. Whatever.

I was trying not to think of school starting but now I can't wait to go so I won't have to deal with her anymore. I need some space and feel like she is smothering me. I know this will be good, for me to get away. I didn't really have the motivation to start getting stuff together but now I do. Tomorrow I am just gonna have to go out and get a bunch of shit. I made out a list of some things but I know it's nowhere near how much I need. 

I have to start packing up my room and going through stuff. But it's really hard to do that now because I don't know where to even start."

Well so far this summer has been relaxing and kind of boring but that is a hell of a lot better than being in school. It is funny, I still feel like I should be going back to Chippewa next year. It hasn't hit me that I am completely done with high school. I don't think it will until I am 3 hours away from home and living with Stef. We talked a little about how we want to decorate our room. From what it sounds like, we will end up with a fricken rainbow of color. But that is Stef. I could care less. 

Her grad party is on Sunday and I am excited. Her family is going crazy trying to prepare for it. My mom wasn't too stressed out about mine. My family was here and able to help her out. 

So it is 20 after 3 and I am sitting here still in my pajamas and I can't remember when the last time I showered was. I know, extremely gross. I am planning on taking one after I am done with this. Which I guess is now."

My brother threw a fit about swimming today. I'm the one who has to drive him to Fraser 3 days a week. 

I went over to Franny's to celebrate her birthday with her family and then Chelsea joined us later.

So tomorrow I have to try and get up early. I spend my whole morning sleeping and it is gone, shortening my day. I want to actually get some stuff done this summer. 

My mom's friend's son is coming over tomorrow to explain some things to me about Western. That will definitely be helpful. He is going into his 5th year for business and human resources I think. He said that sometimes the counselors don't sit down with you and help you pick your classes. You end up having a half hour to pick the classes you want to take. Well, I think I am going to need some more time to really figure out what I want to do.

Then after I might stop by Ashley's. 

Sunday isn't quite the end. Not until I have my diploma on Monday will it be over. I'm excited."

I went to see my brother and my mom dance last night. The recital was really great. 

Friday I went to the all-nighter and honestly it wasn't anything special. I had a good time. A few things happened that I am not going to waste my time talking about. 

So what was my high school experience like? Hmm I don't know if words could describe it. What I do know is, high school is nothing like what people say it is. ""The best years of your life."" I don't think so. Those years are yet to come."

Usually I have no problem just BSing everything. But for some reason, I can't concentrate and bring myself to write this. I have other things on my mind I guess. 

I received my confirmation for my orientation from Western. I have to go June 15, Stef's birthday. That's the one day I didn't want but I got stuck with it because I sent the request in late. So I have been thinking about registering for my classes and meeting with my counselor. I also hope I can meet some current students while I am there. I started looking at the floor plan for the room and trying to decide what I need to take with me and what Stef can contribute. I want to go to Fall Welcome Week. It starts August 23 and goes through the 27th. I get to move in early and get settled and meet some new students. It is going to be really hard for me to meet new people but I have to open up and be confident in myself. I always feel like that is standing in my way. I think by joining CCF it will help. I have been looking at the website and find myself getting really excited about it. I might try and email some of the students involved now so I can get a better idea. I know by being a part of that organization it will help me stay on the straight and narrow next year.  

For now I am trying to focus on getting through these next few days of school. I cannot believe it is almost over. Then again, I have been waiting for this for as long as I can remember. I have had my fair share of high school and couldn't be more thrilled that it is over. Everyone says that high school is probably the best time in your life. I beg to differ. My high school experience is lacking in ""good times."" I mean, I had fun with my friends and stuff but other people just had to screw it up for me. And I didn't want to let that get to me but it did. Just like how prom wasn't all it's cracked up to be. I am ready to be done with the immature high school scene.

"event","I have gone back on my word and feel like crap because of it. I finally thought that everything was going to be fine and I never had to take part in anything like drinking again. And what do I go and do? I went to Jen's pimps and hos party on Saturday and realized later that I had made the wrong decision. Sure being there was fine but I went there with the intention of getting smashed. And that is exactly what I did. I didn't think it was a big deal until after when I got home and thought of how wrong it was to lie to my mom. I had come a long way. I stopped lying to her and felt better and then this happened. When I was at the party I attracted some negative attention that made me feel horrible after. I just really need to stop doing this to myself. I have grown out of it. This whole week I have been complaining about how juvenile high school is and here I am being a part of that. So that's the last time. 

Friday is senior skip day. I am going to cedar point with Katie. It should be fun. I am hoping that a few other people come with us. My mom is paranoid of course. When is she not. But she is letting me go because she knows that she is going to have no control of what I do next year. 

But first I have to work tomorrow. I am kind of hoping that with this on-going investigation, they will find a reason to close the place. I hate it so much. But I cannot quit until I find another job. And the chances of that happening is slim to none. College kids are back and they get first dibs. Oh well. 

I am looking forward to school getting out and graduation and then my family coming out here for my grad party. I have no idea what the summer entails and that is somewhat exciting. But I know it is going to go by really fast. I'm gonna need some help getting through it."

This year sucks and I can't wait for it to be over. I know that I will probably only miss my close friends and everyone else doesn't really matter. I just have to make it through the next few weeks. 

Stef is in Mexico right now. Not fair. I don't think she gets back until Sunday. Whatever. 

I miss my family a lot. I was lucky enough to have visited them in February. And they are coming out here at the end of June. At the end of August I get to go back for my family reunion. So it won't be too long until I see them again. This passed year I have spent a lot of time with them which is nice because I never get to. I used to only see them twice a year. I made the decision to stay here for school next year. I think it would be way too difficult to move away now. I need to be on my own first to see if I can even handle that. It would be nice though to move there maybe after 2 years or after college. I can always think about it. And that makes me feel better. I want to be able to spend as much time with my cousins as I can. I thought that it would be fun to go on a road trip this summer. I really want to go to Cape Cod. I have never been there but my parents have and they said it is beautiful. That could be one fun senior thing to do, if I have time. 

I bought my prom dress on Sunday. It is green. And not an ugly green. It is kind of hard to explain. You'll have to see it. I had a weird dream about prom. It was funny how real it felt. I just wish it was. 

My mom is trying to fix me up with someone. Ok, when your mother starts doing that, then there is definitely something wrong. I just want some time to myself. Yeah maybe it would be nice to have a relationship but I want it to be one full of substance. And I know I am not going to find that now. I don't want to be dealing with someone who I know will not be in the picture for a long time."

My brother left early with Kevin today so he won't be driving down there with us. I am kind of relieved that I am not leaving the country or going some place where I can get in trouble. 

So more college crap. I visited Western and really like the campus. I have to say that I am excited about college. I think it will be a really good experience for me. The whole living away thing, I am just going to have to get used to it. I know that it will be difficult to get adjusted but I figure that there is plenty to keep me busy so I shouldn't worry too much. The only thing I am slightly worried about is Stef not being able to go there. I really want her to but it is not my decision. She has to choose to got there herself. Ugh, so now I am counting on her to go because I need someone to room with. And I don't want to room blind. Who knows who I'll end up with. 

I hate working! People suck and I need to kill them!

I need to go away and clear my head. But then again, I have this feeling that going there will only bring more issues to confront. I like Nick and I want to have a relationship with him that is more than friendship. I don't know whether I built up a fantasy in my head or if I truly believe that there is something between us. That is probably what I am going to find out when I go. And that scares me. I have never been in a long relationship at all. I find something wrong with every single person. But I think I am just afraid to get close to someone. When I met him, I immediately thought about how much we have in common and I just couldn't think of losing someone like that. That kind of person doesn't come around often at all. I don't want to have to let him go. It would be so hard for me to do that because for once in my life I have this new found optimism and I know a lot of it has to do with him. I need to talk to him about all of this. Of course that is going to be hard. (Sigh)

You are gonna be screwed if you can't handle this."" That is different. I won't be around people constantly for a whole fricken week like I will for spring break. Plus, I want to spend my senior year spring break with my friends. Not people I don't know. Sorry, but I don't see the fun in that. I am now currently organizing something for myself. And I will talk to Fran and Chelsea about it and see what they think. My parents are fine with me going somewhere in the country but they want me with people I know and they don't want me driving. I have started looking at hotels and stuff I just have to make sure I will be able to budget this properly. I don't want to spend too much. I can't anyway. I talked to my parents and they said that they will chip in some but they have to be okay with the place I go to. They said forget Panama City. So oh well. I wasn't even going to go on spring break but then again, it is a week to just get away and do nothing. I want to relax over spring break I don't want to be around a ton of people. Kids either go to a city in Mexico or Florida-Miami or Panama City. Those are popular. I don't want to deal with a bunch of damn people and high schoolers. That is the reason I want to leave, to get away from that. Not be dumped into a whole mess of fricken kids. Geez, I sound like an old person. 

I needed to get it all out b/c I am annoyed and frustrated. So far my senior year hasn't turned out quite like I had imagined. For once I would like something to work out nicely."

"event","I have my college writing mid-term tomorrow. I guess it shouldn't be too bad. I have to write an essay on the class and my experience so it's almost like a reflection. I also have sociology tomorrow. Lol. I don't know what to expect from that one. 

So I have recently gotten more involved with exercising and getting healthy. I think I am joining Bally's. I'll be able to go there and see what kinds of things they have to offer. If anyone wants to join with me, let me know. I bought DDR and have been playing that constantly. It is so much fun and a really great work out. I'm also getting better at it. And I have gotten back into doing Pilates. 

College issues...I don't know where to begin. I have to decide soon and I can't until I hear from the colleges in Rhode Island. They requested information so I know it is gonna take longer. I need to send them my semester grades and I won't see those until all my exams are graded. I don't know how long that will be. I will have to make my decision based on whether I get in or not. If I get in, I still don't know if I am going to go. My major problem is just going because of a guy. And of course that isn't right. I would also go there because of my family. I have no clue as to what I want to major in so I don't really think I should base my decision on what the school has to offer. If I don't know what I am going to do, then does it matter what school I go to? If I were to stay here, I would probably end up going to Western. I have this whole picture in my head about how Stef and I would go to the same school and room together and have a good ol' time. But she has her heart set on Calvin. She hasn't heard from them I don't think but still, she wants to go there. And I shouldn't really be counting on her to be a deciding factor in my choice either. But the sad thing is, she will and so will Nick. It seems like everyone knows where they are going. 

My mom booked tickets for us to fly out to Rhode Island for mid-winter break. I am thinking of touring the campuses and maybe sitting in on one of Nick's classes, if I can. My mom also said that we can take a day and drive to Massachusetts to see some of our friends. I am kind of nervous because I haven't seen most of them in like 9 years. It should be interesting. I miss my family so much so I am excited about going. 

Stef and I have to plan our spring break. We are thinking about going to San Francisco because her aunt lives out there and both of our parents do not want us leaving the country. All I want to do during that week is relax. And if it is just Stef and I, then everything should be fine. Plus I have never been to California. 

Well it looks like I am done. Hmm maybe I should try and study. Or maybe I will just end up doing everything but that. Yep, sounds good."

Friday night I went to look for DDR with Franny and I couldn't find it. So I am gonna have to go back and look somewhere else. If anyone knows where to get it, please tell me. After that we went over to Chelsea's for a while and had a frustrating conversation. All I can say is, I am irritated about some recent things that have happened and it seems that there is no way for me to do anything about them. I am struggling to see the brighter side of the situation because as far as I'm concerned, there isn't one. 

Yesterday I had to work and that sucked. I couldn't get over how many people complained the whole time. And it wasn't like I was doing anything wrong. Ugh people just bother me. This never happens when I work during the week. And now Beth asked to work for me on Thursday because that is the only day she can work. That means I won't have 2 days next week. But I am working Saturday morning again so I shouldn't be complaining. I just hope everyone will lighten up by then.

Last night Franny came over and we just watched a movie. 

Today I went to church and then came home for a while. My mom all of a sudden decided that she wanted to go to Somerset. She had to exchange a ring my dad got her for their anniversary and get her watch adjusted. I went with her and walked all over the place. I had never been there before so it was nice to see what kind of stores were there. I am gonna go back and spend a day there because you can't just go for 2 hours. 

My dad bought my brother a Honda Civic. He actually flew out to Chicago to get it and then drove it back. I still cannot believe he did that. My brother doesn't appreciate anything so it surprised me that my dad would just go and buy him a car. And he has the worst attitude ever. Mike practiced driving it today. Oh yeah, it's a 5-speed manual. So he is going to have to learn how to drive that. And my dad wants to teach me how to drive it too. I think I should learn in case I ever have to drive it. 

I am not doing anything tonight. Just watching my beloved Patriots. My dad has money on the Colts so let's hope they lose. Lol."

I think things are looking up. I talked to both Mrs. Luft and Mr. Rowzee about writing letters for me and they said it wasn't a problem at all. Thank God! That puts me at ease. Now the only thing left is bringing my grade up in college writing and studying for exams. I am planning some days to go to the library. I don't exactly have a choice because I am always way too distracted around here. I will actually get some work done for once. I just need to figure out when I am going to go. I haven't exactly had much time. 

Ugh and I have to work tomorrow night and saturday morning. I guess it isn't that bad. I haven't worked in 2 weeks because of my surgery so I figure it's about time I went back. Plus I am in need of some money. Oh and I found out some how Lauren has my check. I guess they gave her the wrong one. That isn't surprising. It's probably only like $25 anyway. 

I am really worried about Katie. And the last thing she needs is me yelling at her. She has been through a lot, probably more than I ever will. I just want to talk to her but she is distancing herself from me and everyone else. I can kind of understand that part. I am just so upset that she has to go through all of this crap. She doesn't deserve it and hopefully she knows that. I don't know what to do anymore.

So snowcoming should be interesting this year. I am going with Dustin. Lol. All I can say is, he better behave himself. And I want him to drive my car or take something decent. I guess I am going to set everything up so let me know if you are coming with me. My mom's friend is hemming my dress right now. I am excited. I just hope it doesn't look...old. For some reason I think the beaded pattern takes on an old lady appearance. I don't know, maybe not. 

I am once again worrying about college stuff. I need to just chill out and not bother with it too much. But I still have a lot of stuff I need to fill out and get sent in. I need to make sure that my grade in college writing isn't going to screw me over. Ugh I hate that class! 

On to some other things. After I was in pain from getting my wisdom teeth out, I got sick. I was hanging around Chelsea and Stef all weekend and they were both sick so I probably got something from them. I wasn't thinking at the time. I am feeling better today though. On the positive side, I played DDR all weekend! That I have to say, is one of the most addicting games ever. And it is one of the few that you can actually use as an exercise regiment. I decided that I am going to get it when I have a chance.

I feel like it is time for me to become independent and start to act like an adult. My parents don't know any of this yet. My mom knows that I applied to colleges there but I don't think she thought I would honestly go there. Well I am. And I have peace about my decision. I know that if I get rejected from the colleges I applied to, then it wasn't meant to be. I think that I have a pretty good chance of getting in though.

Today Fran came over and we rented some movies. Saved and A Chinderella Story. I thought both were good. Saved was kind of weird because I have never in my life seen people act like that and hopefully they don't because that was going overboard. People think that I go overboard with the whole religion thing. I was trying to explain stuff to Nick last night and he just started laughing. I opened up to him and felt better that I did. I just didn't want him to think that I was a freak or anything. 

Tomorrow I am going to see a movie with him but I don't know which one and I think that I want some other people there too because I said it was like an early birthday celebration. Got a laugh out of that one too. 

My brother had a little problem tonight. I guess some of his friends got pissed at him and they were going to beat him up. They were supposedly high and had tasers. I don't know. But I went and picked him up and he told me the whole story. Him and Jeremy ended up sitting in the car forever talking about it because he gave some girl his jacket and I guess she took it home with her and I wasn't going to drive around and find her house because she doesn't exactly live close. Then I told Mike if he has anymore problems to come to me becaue I got Nick and all of his cousins to back me up. You hang out with Albanians and you're all set.

I have this intro paragraph to write for college writing and I can't bring myself to work on it now. It will put me in a bad mood and I don't need that.

Yesterday was fun. I got my hair done with Fran and I guess it turned out good. It will take some time for me to get used to it though. We were going to go to Great Lakes but by the time our hair was finished, it was too late and my mom wouldn't let me go. So we went to Lakeside instead. I wasn't in a shopping mood anymore so that was pretty pointless. Once I got home I had to help my brother with his speech outline. He can never do anything himself. My mom ended up spending like 2 hours helping him with it. 

I went to the game and was very disappointed when our poor excuse for a football team lost! That pissed me off so much and Nick kept rubbing it in of course. Victor went with his friend Matt who I met at Stef's house. Fran and Chelsea came with me. After the game we met up with them at Koney's, the one on Hall that closes at 10. So we couldn't even eat because they were turning the grills off when we got there. I knew that the one on Garfield would be way too crowded anyway. We stopped at Stef's after and listened to her scream at her brother. Lol. I feel so bad for her because her brother doesn't listen to Stef and does what he wants. I would have to beat him if he acted like that to me. Her parents weren't home though so we couldn't really stay that long. 

I might go to small groups tonight. I really want to but I have to make sure that other stuff gets done around here first. 

Oh and if anyone would like to join a gym with me, please let me know. Stef, I am not willing to run outside and make a fool out of myself but you can feel free to do that. ;)"

I have a feeling that it is almost gone now because I have a sore throat and am coughing now and once that happens, it usually means I am on my way to getting better. 

Revolution was a blast! I had so much fun and it was great to experience something like that. I know I definitely needed to. I am making changes in my life. Well, continuing to. I am figuring out what my priorities are. I feel like I'm in a better mood too. Kent asked me to give a testimony in front of the whole youth group. I was really nervous just thinking about it, but you know what, I know that I have to do it. And it is different because I am speaking in front of a group of people who are all there for the same thing. So I know that will relax me. I haven't written it yet, but I am going to find some time to do it. Stef, I know you will make sure that I don't back out of this. You have nothing to worry about though. 

So tomorrow I am getting my hair highlighted with Fran. I am still thinking about what I want to get done. I'll probably decide there. After that we are going shopping at Great Lakes. I am excited because I have never been there before. Yes I know, pretty sad. And then we are going to the game and I will be able to see Nick. I haven't really been able to hang out with him in a while. Victor and Anton will be there too so I really want Stef to go. Please just call in to work and say that you are sick. You are, so it isn't really lying.

I haven't talked to Stef in like 2 days so I don't know what's going on with her and I don't know, it is worrying me a little because she still doesn't know what her punishment is. I am afraid to call her house.

This week was longer than it should have been. I am so sick of school. The same thing every day. I was upset when I found out my cumulative GPA isn't what I thought it was. I am doing fine this semester but I screwed myself the first 2 years. It's hurting me now and finally I understand why people told me that the first 2 years are the most important. But who is honestly thinking about college then. I am still going to apply to a bunch of places and see what happens. I guess I'll never know until I try. 

I watched the O.C. premiere last night. I love that show so much. It's so unrealistic. That's why it's great. I mean, they have 20 somethings playing 18 year olds. I'm thinking, hey, I'm a senior and there are no guys like that at Chippewa.

Because I have disappointed myself once again and my parents. It is hard to control myself sometimes. But I know that it is necessary.

This weekend I am going to Revolution with Stef. I have been waiting for this for a while and think that it is my calling. Stef talks about these retreats all the time and they sound like so much fun and a really great experience. So YAY!

I have also decided that I need to crack down on my procrastination and start filling out some applications. Stacie was accepted to Western and her ACT score wasn't the best. So, there is some hope for me I guess. 

I am still waiting for that right person and I will continue to patiently. Gosh after talking to Stef about this countless times it depresses me. But I know that I have to wait and I guess I never know what will happen at Thanksgiving."

"event","I haven't written in here in a while. I have been extremely tired and avoiding the computer lately. I don't know why, maybe I just haven't felt like it. 

I met this guy Nick yesterday and he is really nice. He went to Seneca and I hardly remember him. But anyway, I went to his cousin's basketball game at Joe Dumars with Stef. It was fun.

More problems with my car. I am not even going to go into it because I am so sick of it all. Let's just say that my wheel could have fallen off like Dustin's.

I have to work tomorrow.  Hopefully I won't cause a scene like last week. I told Linda about it today and felt like such an idiot over what happened. I don't know, I just get way over emotional at times. The good part is, I get to work with her and LeeAnn tomorrow and then Thursday it's only her and I. I am working Saturday morning with Lauren. I haven't worked a Saturday in a long time. I just really need some hours.

My mom brought up the idea today of going on a cruise for spring break. At first I didn't want to and then I thought, well it shouldn't be so bad. I won't see her that often anyway. And this way maybe Fran's parents will let her come if they know my parents will be there. So I am going to get everyone together who want to go and we will discuss all of this because if we don't do it soon, it's not going to happen.

I find myself thinking about Thanksgiving more and more each day. And I don't really know why. It might be because I spent time with my cousins alone and now I really miss them a lot. I love my family so much and I just wish I could be closer to them. 

Here is my theory on college: I really want to go to Oakland but then again, I don't know what I want to major in so that doesn't make much sense. I don't want to waste money on trying to figure out what I want to do. So that's when I thought about Macomb. But I don't want to live at home because I have a feeling that my parents are going to keep the same rules for me that I have now. And I can't afford to live in an apartment. I would have to share it with 5 people.




And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive




Time for me to do some homework. :/"

Well today as I was leaving school I almost went off like a psycho. I walk over to my car and see Mike standing there waiting for me to unlock the door. I open my door and then I open the back door to put my backpack in. To my surprise Jeremy was crouched down hiding in the back seat. There was a 10 second delayed reaction on my screaming. And then I yelled at him and got pissed off. Well, walking by my car at the time was Chris Dejardins and some other kid with him. They were mocking me and that just did it for me. I was ready to blow up at him but I guess I was so upset I couldn't say anything. So I got in the car and let out a very long string of words that I am not going to repeat in here. My brother thought I was going crazy but he said,""Steph, if you need me to do anything, let me know. Slash his tires, egg his car, etc..I'll do it all."" I'm like ok thanks. I would love to do that. Be prepared for my revenge you fat f@$k! I hate him sooo much. 

So I heard something about a party this weekend...anyone want to further explain.

I could seriously use something right about now.

Homecoming is almost all set now. Just have to figure out a few more things. Like where the after party is."

Now I don't know what to do. Maybe if we all can resolve this somehow it might be better. I don't think it's really solving anything by going to Dakota's. It just makes it look like I am running away from stuff I can't handle.

#1 Katie is not going in our group with us. 
#2 Chelsea is probably going to Dakota's.
#3 There will only be like 3 of us going.

Even though I did get a dress, 2 dresses, I can always save them for something else. My mom will be pissed but oh well. And yes it is senior year, but...oh who am I kidding! I still want to go but going without my friends isn't going to be fun. So I am not just gonna stand there by myself and look stupid. I will sit at home and be miserable instead."

"event","I am bored and there is nothing to do. Fran called me so I need to call her back because I think it's been an hour and I don't want to keep her waiting. 

So yesterday I had to work and I thought it was gonna suck but it wasn't that big of a deal. I wasn't there not even an hour and the crap started. One of the servers, Abe, was being a jerk as usual. I was going to tell one of the other servers that I sat his section but he was cashing out so I just waited until he was done. But before I could tell him, Abe came over and started freaking out about the table. ""Greg you have this table and they have been sitting there forever and want to order."" I was like, ""I just sat them about a minute ago so chill out."" Well for some reason he got pissed and said, ""Don't tell me what to do, shut up..."" and then I forgot the rest of it. Not a big deal because I know that he is a jerk and that is just his personality. One of the cashiers told me to go tell the manager how he talked to me because he is not aloud to say that. I was going to and then turned around and went in the bathroom to calm myself down because I was going to start screaming. I leave the bathroom and Linda starts asking me if I was crying and I said no and then my manager came up to the front and the cashier told him that I was crying and before I could say that I wasn't, I started to. I don't know why, I guess I was just letting all of the stress out from the past week. My manager made me go back into the office and tell him what happened and told me to calm down and tell him next time someone says something like that to me.  So I was pissed at him the whole night and never said one word to him. 

After that was over, I was fine and the night went well. I ended up staying later and talked to Mateen for a while. There is a new server, Nathen, from one of the other locations working here and when I saw him I thought that he looked very familiar. So when his shift was done I started talking to him and tried to figure out where I might have seen him before. He is nice and hot but he is tall. Lol. Oh and he smokes :( I didn't even realize it until I saw him in the lounge and was like ok well that is a turn off.

Today I didn't do anything really, just cleaned. My brother's friend's family came over for dinner and then the boys went golfing. And now it comes back to me sitting here bored out of my mind. Well, gotta go."

"event","There is nothing really to say about school other than it sucks and I hope the year goes by fast. I like some of my classes. I hate lunch because there is pretty much no one in there. Maybe I need to make some new friends too. 

I will soon be stressed out over homecoming, ACT's, work, and other school stuff. 

I wasn't supposed to work tonight because I closed for someone thursday night so she said that she would work for me tonight. Well, I get a phone call this morning and it is from her. She tells me she got in a car accident last night and just came back from the hospital. She is a nice girl and everything but I have this feeling that she lies about a lot of stuff. Like the fact she has been sick for the last 4 or 5 days. And that's the reason why she went home early. Hopefully it is slow tonight because it's Labor Day weekend and a lot of people are out of town. I pray that I have a relaxing night.

Yesterday I went to the football game and was in serious need of some kind of drugs. lol. I don't think I can handle going to those things anymore. Too many people I can't stand are there and I just felt claustrophobic. Feeling like that when you are outside is pretty bad. 

Well, my mom just came home and I need to get some stuff done for her."

"event","First day of school is tomorrow and I am a little less than thrilled. 

Right now my car is screwed up and it's not really that big of a deal but my dad did freak out. I had to put my parking pass on my car so I grabbed the spare key from the kitchen because I didn't feel like running up to my room. Once I got the sticker on, I tried locking the door and for some reason not all of the doors would lock. My dad was outside so I asked him to help me figure out what was wrong. I thought it was just the key so I went up to my room and got my keys and then went outside and my dad was getting pissed about something. Turns out the left backseat door won't lock because the lock on the inside is jammed. Right away my dad wanted to know who was back there and how it happened. Of course yelling at me the whole time. He is still working on it and is probably in the worst mood. But my dad is the type of person to keep working on something until he can fix it or get it right. And it doesn't matter how long it takes. So I am hiding down here.  

Today I did some last minute shopping and I didn't realize how much I spent. I never intended to but it just happened. I got a little carried away I guess. 

I spoke to Stef and she is seriously thinking about transferring. But she said that she is gonna see how it is at Dakota and if she cannot stand it, then she will leave. I think that it would be so much fun if we went to the same school together. And she wouldn't have to deal with the same people over there. Chippewa is not as bad I guess. I think she would honestly be happier.

Anyway, the saga continues. If anyone feels like doing a good deed, I need a homecoming date. 

See ya'll tomorrow."

"event","My day yesterday was interesting and fun. I had to work at 10 yesterday morning and for the first hour I was by myself until Steph and Linda showed up. I was feeling like crap since I woke up and I was trying not to make a big deal out of it. I just think that it isn't really healthy for me to work 4 days in a row. And 3 out of the 4 were mornings. That leaves more time for people to come up and complain. I just love it when someone yells at me about something and doesn't give me any time whatsoever to explain the reason why I did it. I am not a stupid person and I don't need people to assume that I am because I am still in high school. I personally feel like I have outgrown high school and no longer belong there. So anyway, around 2 o'clock I started feeling worse and without realizing it, I was holding my stomach. Well, my manager saw that and asked if I was feeling ok. I said that I wasn't and he said that I could leave if I wanted to. I was like, I don't know if he is being serious or if he just said that as a joke. But he said that if I couldn't work I should leave. So, I did. 

Once I left, I called Franny to see if she wanted to grab some lunch with me. I picked her up and we went to Koney. After we were done I saw one of the older, like my dad's age guys who I work with there. He is a cook. And I told him how I left early and some of the other stuff that was going on.

Franny came back to my house and we chilled for a while. Mary called and asked us to go over there. She ordered pizza from Father and Son. We all went to go pick it up and I had to stop for gas. Mary decided that we should stop in and see Dustin at Nino's. We stopped by Mary's department and I nearly died when I saw the hottest guy working over there. I was like, ""Mary how can you work with him every day?"" I know I wouldn't be able to concentrate. When we found Dustin he looked surprised to see us. I started talking to him and then someone called his name and when I turned my head to see who it was I thought I would be sick or faint. Kevin was standing right there. I tried to not make a big deal out of it. I mean I am mature enough to handle stupid people like him. I saw Mary and Fran turn around and walk down an aisle so I followed them and then stood there worried about what was gonna happen next. Thankfully Kevin left and Dustin came around the corner to talk to us. I was like, ""What did he say to you?"" Apparently Kevin wanted Dustin to see his car. Why did he have to come all the way to Nino's to bother him with pointless crap?

I am so glad that I got rid of that and now I wonder why I even started anything with him in the first place. I think maybe I was part desperate and then really stupid. During that whole time I was spiritually lost in a sense. I was trying to fill a void and I thought at the time, he was the best one to help me with that. Of course now I do realize that I was wrong and I guess I do understand the reason why I even got myself involved with him. I cannot thank God enough for steering me in the right direction now.

So back to last night. When we got back to Mary's house we ate and then watched Simply Irresistible. That is such a cute movie. Right when it was ending Dustin came over and we just talked for a while. Mary kicked us out at 11:30 but I had to take Franny home anyway. 

My brother is all excited because he has a homecoming date now, some girl he doesn't even know. 

I have yet to find a homecoming date. Part of me doesn't really care and then I remember that it is my senior homecoming and it would be nice to have someone to go with. 

Anyway, I have nothing going on today. Don't have to work so I am probably gonna stay home and do nothing all day unless someone wants to do something. 

Bye for now."

"event","Last night I went to blockbuster with Fran and Chelsea and I saw Brandon and Danielle there. We started talking for a while and then all of a sudden there were quite a few people from Chippewa that kept popping up in the store. I was like, ""Is this a test to see if I can handle school?"" So Chels and Fran came back to my house and we watched Connie and Carla. I thought it was pretty good. 

Today I woke up to the sound of my brother bounding through the door with his schedule. Someone's a little excited. 

My parents took my pictures back today and I am not sure how it went because I haven't heard from my mom yet. Oh well, I don't care which ones they chose.

I really don't want to go to work. I have to close tonight because the other 2 girls started school this week. More money though, I should be thankful.

Alrighy I am gonna finish up my laundry and then get ready. I'll update later."

I am not too fond of Lauren though, I guess because she is my brother's age and she is kind of trashy. I don't know, maybe I can adjust to her. So Stacie and I are dealing with the same thing right now...older guys. This one guy who we work with asked her out and he is 21. While there is the guy who I am currently interested in and he is 20. I don't really see a problem with it.  I actually think it is kind of funny that we are both going through the same thing. She left around 3 and I was stuck there 'till 4. At 4 the guy I like came in to work and I spent some time talking to him. By the way his name is Mateen and I am not quite sure what nationality he is. He told me and then I forgot. I just know that it is a small country. Sure his name is different but don't let that throw you off. He is so sweet and I feel comfortable around him and that is important. 

My parents are trying to decide which senior pictures they should get. It is taking forever because even though there might not seem to be that much to choose from, there really is. My mom is still upstairs trying to figure everything out. We have been doing this for about 2 hours now and I am about ready to tell her to just pick something and be done with it. 

I think I might do something with Fran and Chelsea tonight. I have to take some movies back to blockbuster so I figured they can come back here and we can watch something. 

Alrighty I am gonna go and sort some things out."

I was kind of hoping that I had more people I knew for sure are in my classes. I think that I have a pretty easy first semester. The only thing that I am worrying about are all the problems that happened last year. I am so sick of all that and I hope all of it can be avoided this year. I want to enjoy my senior year.

After registration I went to the mall with Mary to look for a homecoming dress. We had no luck at first in any of the stores because it seemed like everything was gone. I convinced Mary to try Windsor and see if there was anything relatively cheap. She ended up getting this darker blue dress that looks a lot like Fran's. She was happy with it even though it was a little more expensive than she hoped for.
I found a few sweaters that I liked and was again very dissapointed to find out that Weathervane is no longer in business.

I have to work tomorrow and I am not really looking forward  to it except for the people who I work with. They are my only saving grace. I am getting a little closer to one of my coworkers. He is really sweet and he is I guess you could say an ""all around nice guy."" We might go out some time this week and see what happens. I am kind of hoping this works out because I need a homecoming date. ;)

Once again Stef was getting upset over her certain someone. I know that everything is going to work out for her though. She deserves someone great. Yeah ya hear that Stef!

Well so far so good with this thing. I kind of miss deadjournal because I am so used to how everything is set up and this one is confusing me and making me mad at the same time. I will figure it out soon enough. 

Here is my schedule, please let me know if you have anything with me.

1. Independent Living- Kubiny
2. 20th Century U.S History- Barnes
3. Environmental Science- Fulton
4. Creative Writing- Chiodini
5. College Writing- Jeffire
6. Sociology- Mallia

"event","holy crap craaazy day yesterday. had a meet in the bronx - there were like hundreds of teams there omg. atleast 200 people in each race.

ok -- the bus ride: hour an a half long .. one of the sophmore boys had to pee realli bad n he was like dieing he wanted to like pee in a bottle .. but the coach wouldn't let him. that was actually funny but i felt bad for him. so the rest of the bus ride was listening to our cd players .. talkin .. doing that thing to ur knee - haha .. and tellin the kid not to pee in a bottle. when we finally got there like 3 kids ran off the bus to go to the bathroom and then the rest of the team got off and went to go find a spot to put our crap. so we had our stuff like right by the finish line. then the sophmore boys B team had their race in like 5 minutes so they went to warm up n stuff. yea so our race wasnt untill 11.19 so we had like an hour n a half to hang out and watch other races n shiatt. so we watched both freshmen boys races, and then the girls A team watched the girls B team race, and then we hadda go warm up n stretch. ahh i hate the begining of races soo much! there were like a billion girls (ok maybe exagerating alil bit) at the starting line, and like ahh its just so frustrating .. haha i sound so stupid. well yea our race started n the field was like way longer than sunken meadows was so that sucked. n then there were these random wood like planks in the course so u hadda like watch the floor all the time. so i finished in 56th place .. and got 11.46 - this course was longer than sunken meadow so we all added to our best times there. 

well since we had the last race of the day we went to get lunch at the deli n some people went to like mcdonald's or w/e. n then like there was this big rock mountain or something n we went like climbing up that thing n on the top u can like see some of the city.. so that was preety cool. then it was like 12.30 n coach was takin attendence then gettin the bus. so we got on the bus n went home. that was one fun bus ride :-) 

after we got back to st johns there was a freshmen football game going on so we went to watch the rest of that. they were playing st anthony's and won 6-0. haha st anthony's lost :-) then my mom came n brought krystyna, meggan, n ricky home.

at like 7 mk & meggan picked me up to go to jackie's parrtay. niceeee house jackie :-) so like there were a few ppl there i knew like brittany, mk, meggan, shannon, lindsay, alana, and of course jackie.. so that was fun - haha alana was yelling at jackie's neighbor and she got all pissed off .. woopsy. hehe. so mk n me got home at like 11-ish n she slept over. we were so tired so we like sorta found me an outfit for the club tonight, and then fell asleep. 

so now im gettin readi to go to meggan's n then at 8 me, mk, meggan, brittany and maybe jackie are going to the club! yay im so excitedd. well im gunna go and get my stuff together and stuff, then sleepin over meggan's tonight with the gurliess.

"event","well i just got extremely bored .. so i figured i would make one of these things.

today was one long, awesome day. got up at 6.45 to get the bus to the meet at like 8. everyone was sooooo hyper this morning! sat with my lovely claire on the bus :-) n then with ricky and meggan in the end.. when we got there we were told that the A team's race wasnt until 10.45 .. so we had like 2 hours to do absolutely nothing! but knowing our team we had fun. so at like 10.15 we went for our warm up n then strechted, did our strides and got on the starting line. the worst part in the meets are definetly the few minutes standing on the starting line waitin for the gun to b shot n ur race to start. i hate it! well lets just keep this short and say freshmen A team got 2nd place .. good job girls! i got a PR today n im very happy bout that- 10.42 biatch! :-)

after our race we did the cool down and whatever n then went to watch the rest of the team race - i think the JV girls won their race and so did the boys. coach was real proud of the team today. then me, meggan, krystyna, red, and loeschner went into the mouse hole to cheer on the Jv girls.. and on the way kept doing retarded things .. haha im not wearing a sweatshirt w/ a hood to races anymore ;-)

at about 3 everyone was gettin readi to leave , and since my wierdo mom stayed for the meet - me n krystyna didnt go on the bus. so now after that loooooooooong day i am very tiredd - i might just go to bed earli tonight .. but then again i highly doubt that. 

tonight meggan, mk, their boyfriends and a few other ppl r goin to the movies .. i was gunna go but the lazy mom didnt want to go pick me up at night. soo yea ill b online all night tonight ;-) 

well im outt gangsterrz _ xoxo <3"

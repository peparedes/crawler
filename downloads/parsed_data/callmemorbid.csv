"event","Unless you're lucky enough to grace my friend's list, you're only reading one out of every 10-15 or so journal entries that I write, and you're definitely not getting any significant dirt, and well, you never will. I learned my lesson a long time ago, which is why my secrets go either into the ear of my boyfriend, into the ear of my best friend, or in another place that is entirely locked away. I know some people just go crazy when they don't have a life to meddle in, but I'm happy to state that mine has been virtually meddle-free for almost a year. Or maybe not, but at the very least I haven't been paying attention. This journal really has no ""dirt"" perse, but when you're a target, hell, even writing about going out for a cheeseburger is dangerous territory. 

Anyway, if you'd like to be added, let me know, and if you're not a mental patient, I'll be happy to oblige. XOXO

Jesus. It's funny how many crushes one can have in their early to mid twenties. I seem to have had my share, and I seem to have embellished every last one. It's fun/funny to look back at all that perfectly and piningly padded angst. It's also comforting to say what should be said without having to pose a million and two questions with the intention (I can only surmise at this stage in my life) of convincing myself that I could turn every pretty boy into the perfect thing. Don't get me wrong -- the questions were fun. There's a certain charm in guessing and wishing and cyncicism combined with outright hypocritical love-lust, but it just can't compete with wisdom. I'd like to be able to say I'm not embarrassed by anything I've ever written or felt, but that's impossible. I can, however, say that there is only vague embarassment at the notion of feeling embarassment. I'd laugh if it weren't so terribly humiliating."

I am afraid. Was disappointed, but now I'm just kind of shaky. He's drinking again. And of course I shouldn't care, because nobody else seems to really, but it affects everything. His sobriety was the only thing that slipped out of his lying lips that I truly believed. I could say ""He's this and this and this, but at least he's sober now"", and now I don't even have that peace of mind. The lock broke off my door and now I live with an alcoholic experiencing a fresh relapse into drinking, and one who considers me the most wicked woman alive at that. So yeah, I'm a little nervous right now. I really didn't expect this. Why the FUCK can't he have a single fucking friend who actually wants to HELP him? Why does unhealthy regression make everyone feel so fucking comfortable? Well, I'm not comfortable. I'm scared shitless. I was fine with a fear-free loathing. Now I'm just worried. About everything. Me mostly, and him leastly, but still a little, because no matter how much you despise someone, it's still heart-breaking to watch them throw another good thing away.

"event","I actually did laundry yesterday, and I might even be loco enough to finish it today. Finishing what I've started isn't typically one of my stronger points. 

Tomorrow I think I'm going to go to New York Deli and apply for the waitressing position. I'm tired of Champps. We don't turn many tables, and even with the holidays upon us, the business in the mall is mediocre at best. NY Deli is small, casual, and like 4 blocks away. I hope they're still hiring. 

I'm supposed to hang out with Traci tomorrow night but I just realized I have to close dinner, so that's no longer an option. NY Deli closes at 8 o'clock so if I worked there I wouldn't have this problem. :) Maybe she'll want to hang out tonight instead. I can try. We've been friends since 7th grade, but we're really bad about hanging out. She moved about 5 blocks from me several months ago, and we really haven't been taking advantage of the fact that we live so close. It's pathetic, really. We used to whine when we lived far away, but now -- she's right there, and we're not hanging out. Hell, she's never even met DAVE who I dated for almost 4 months. In fact, I'm not entirely positive that she even KNOWS about Dave. I'm starting to make myself feel guilty. Fin.

So, Raquel is in Florida now with the love of her life. I think it's adorable, though it's still hard to shake the fact that we'll probably never even live in the same city again. I know there's a point when it won't be sad to me, but that point is not now, especially with everything that's happened. I needed to talk to my best friend, and then I realized that not only do I not have one, but she's not here anyway. I honestly think she was one of the only things that made Richmond tolerable for me. I no longer have anyone to go to Romania with. I no longer have anyone to make gay tape-recorded songs with. I no longer have anyone to make 100 bucks an hour getting tied up with. I no longer have anyone to make me cupcakes on my birthday. Or to celebrate Rock Hashanna with. Or to make awesome comics about the details of a life that everyone else seems to find insignificant, if they are even aware of them at all. I no longer have anyone to watch anime porn with. Or to change the lyrics to Tori songs with. Or to do Arnold with. Or to broadcast a private block-exclusive radio station with. Or to make fun of Mike with. Or to go to the river with. Goth nights are boring. I hardly ever go anymore. I NEVER dance anymore. So you see, I loved the little whore. I love the little whore. Probably always will. She is by far the absolute coolest girl I have ever known, hands down. 

I just got my SG hoodie that Mike bought me in the mail. It fits great, so now I can show off my Suicidegirls.com pride, even though they rejected my set for poor picture quality and I'm considering selling it to a competitor. So, I may end up getting archived on SG, but I sure would enjoy that money. How loyal am I? Bah. Who cares? It's just T & A, afterall. I'm considering hitting up our former bondage guy, Rick, and doing whatever the hell he wants me to. For 100 bucks or more an hour, I think I could forget the fact that I was using a dildo in front of a sweaty old man for a few hours. I think I could forget almost anything. I said almost. Sure would make Christmas shopping a breeze. Hey mom, you like the dress? Guess what your baby girl did to afford it?! That's right! I let a middle aged fat man fuck me with a 5 speed studded dildo while I was gagged and bound to a spinny chair at a Best Western! I know, I know, you're so proud. Shhhhhh. I know you are. kiss kiss.

Rockbot has a show next week in -- get this -- CHESTERFIELD. That's right folks, there's no denying that we'll inevitably be spotted by at least half a dozen label scouts and record execs in the prestigious high school or church that we end up rocking. I'm so excited. Gimme a break. 

New Years Resolution: At least 2 weeks in Europe in 2005. Who's coming with me?"

"event","still considering moving. things are good with the band right now, but I don't think that's going to be enough to keep me here. more than likely, nothing will be. I'm done with this city. at least I think. If I move it probably won't be until the spring -- I'll need to get a new job or at least save up enough money to do without a job for a month or so, and of course set up a new living situation. I get excited thinking about it. You know, getting the fuck away. There's too much pain in this city. I realize that one shouldn't move just to run away, and I'm not. I just want to start over. Live somewhere else. Meet new people. Something like that. Anyway, nothing is definite. I'm sure I'll know before long. 

Waiting for my new set to go up -- actually more just waiting for the bigass check. Grrr. 

Have to go back to work soon. I despise these doubles. Please pick up for me tomorrow Dave. ::pout::"

"event","I'm sick of these bad dreams. I hardly ever even dream, but lately it's just nightmare after nightmare. Last night I dreamt I had a huge anorism (sp?) in my head. And I don't even know exactly what that is, but in my dream it was a big bursting vein in my fucking forehead that my dad was trying to slice open with a knife. It was very scary. Everyone kept telling me I was going to die at midnight, but when midnight came I was still alive and I just kind of sat around and cried waiting to die and then I did....I actually reached the part of the dream where I died. First time ever. 

The night before last my sister was dying of cancer, and I ended up using a drill to drill little holes all the way through my wrists. That one was a terkjerker. Fuck this shit. 

And I can't come. I can't fucking COME. I can wear myself out masturbating for 15 minutes, and for no fucking reason. I'm pissed."

"event","Someone who was supposed to care for me and keep me safe is now someone I am terrified of.

I wake up every day feeling numb.

I hear every disgusting unfounded insult over and over again, overlapping sometimes. 

I hear that I am worthless.

That I am a trick cunt. That I am garbage. 

I see his raised fist. 

I still feel glass in my hair even though I've showered 6 times.

I still find blood on the floor. 

I still have the message on my machine.

He will be leaving. I don't know when, but he will be. 

If violence, destruction, raping the last bit of innocence from my spirit is something brought about by love, then I want nothing to do with love. 

I feel destroyed. I will never be any good for anybody. I used to think the world was a good place. I used to think he would protect me if anyone tried to hurt me. He said he loved me. He was supposed to protect me. He was supposed to be my friend. Instead he stood there and watched me panic and cry, watched me cower, watched me gasp -- he stood there and waited for me to be completely broken, and when I was -- he stepped on me and ground me into the floor with his boot. 

Stop crying you worthless fucking cunt. Stop fucking crying. You're a fucking trick. 

And then he spit on me.

Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman can i be your man?

Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me,

C'mon, take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up...

(Ooh, in the name of love)
Pour some sugar on me
(C'mon fire me up)
Pour your sugar on me
(Oh, I can't get enough)

I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

Listen! red light, yellow light, green-a-light, go!
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up
oh, loosen up

You gotta please a little, squeeze a little
Tease a little more
Easy operator come a knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah

You've got the peaches, I've got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine

"event","just when you think everything is fine, your whole world is shattered and you see that nothing is what it really seems to be. as time progresses, there is more evil being displayed in the already impure hearts of the masses. trust is a sacred object more holy than the manuscript that the devout follow. individuals destroy the trust that they have earned, leaving a constant select few, and abandon them. desperate for a new life to build, the broken man is slowly being strangled and their hope for survival is being eradicated, until a day comes when they collapse and realize that their striving was futile because they could not change their fate. they would always be abused and broken no matter the situation because of who they are inside themselves. time after time their trust is broken and time after time the hearts of the evil fill with more of their deadly venom and begin to subconsciously or consciously look for a new victim to destroy."

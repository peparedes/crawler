But still, for an academic it's a biggie. 

He's getting all nervous already.&nbsp; And this from the guy that didn't want to go through the ceremony."

I just lately seem to be pretty below par on everything.&nbsp; And working hard at it too!

Where is your guidance councilor when you need one?"

"event","So, I'm babysitting this cat named Leo.  His ""mother"" is off in China with my mother (the real kind so no quotation marks) so I said I would watch Leo if she looked after my mother. 

Well, Leo is a very dumb cat who is now stuck up the chimney.  Yup, you heard me right!  So, what to do?  Any suggestions???  I'll try the Humane Society in the morning (as it is now nearly midnight) and then the chimney sweep.  But other suggestions are quite welcome (short of a sledge hammer to the bricks)"

"event","I know its nothing, but its still bugging and driving me crazy for some reason.

Ever get in a mood where, instead of all those familiar favorites offering comfort and fond memories, they just seem to remind you of every stupid bone headed mistake you've ever made?  Yeah, so now I can't stand to listen to a single CD in the house, find a book to read for fun, or pretty much doing anything without getting mad at myself for some stupid thing.  I don't know why, but every now and then this mood hits and I start throwing everything away.  Which can be a good thing, just a bit painful and unproductive.  It's times like this I start drinking tea instead of coffee, so good thing I found my stash cleaning the garage yesterday."

Getting majorly excited for those last 2 weeks of my trip in September when I get to drop in with Sarah and bug the crap out of many of you.  Yuppers, will be much fun.  And I will have super earned it by then, that's for sure.  Crazy work-a-holics.  Really, weekends are when you stop working and actually eat dinner before 10pm, I swear!

Well, gotta go get some lunch.  Hope you all are well and happy.  I'll get working on the whole postcard situation soon!

"event","so it looks like I have more than one post in me today.  While at the conference we had a wine tasting evening, that just didn't satisfy (let's just say there is a reason Swabian wines don't get exported) and it was with a repeat wine tasting partner as well, so now its got me all in a mood to go tasting.  So, Sarah, I think you need to report in down south here very very soon!  It's an itch I can't scratch alone!"

"event","It is now official. I am  my own worst enemy.  I obviously am not adult enough to handle distractions at this time.  I am far too content to just sit glaze-eyed at the computer screen all day rather than face my dissertation.  Contentment tends to lead to inaction, and a general wasting away of time that leads me wondering where the days have gone.  It's mostly playing games and reading various news papers on line that are sucking up the time (which isn't really a bad thing, being informed is good, but stil....) but apparently, like an addict, it has to be cold turkey for me.  So, I'm pulling the plug.  Literally.  I'm taking out the internet cable, and turning it over to a responsible adult-type authority figure to hold for the next week.  If I'm good and productive during that time, I'll put it back so I can check in and make sure you all haven't destroyed the world in my absence.  The hardest part is going to be not even turning the computer on at work.  I'm so without will power!!!

Right, so behave (or really I hope misbehave) yourselves while I""m gone, and post lots of interesting bits and such so that when I get back online I have a nice reward to read through.

Toodles!!

Well, it's good news bad news time again.  

Bad news first, my little studies turned in their papers today.  They all got them in on time, but of course now I have to grade the darn things.  WHY ME???  I can do this though.  I'm sitting here at work bored for the next 2.5 hours, that should be plenty of time to read 8 15-20 page papers.  Yup, I can make myself start at any time!

Good news, Yo Yo Ma is playing here on campus next year.  That would just be the greatest.  I don't know who managed to convince him to play in a podunk like this, buy Yay to whoever it is!

Got the Cowboy Junkies playing quietly and Tuesday Morning always reminds me of why there is no way no how I could date someone in my current state of mind.  Nope, no way!"

OK, what I want to know, is why every stupid quiz ends up saying I don't like to stay put when that isn't even one of the questions asked?  Do I really have such a restless vibe?  I mean yeah, I want to move now, but it's not like I've moved very far in my life.  Hello, just go home from the house I grew up in where I sat my sorry butt on the couch and watched TV, same as most every night of my life!  

In other news, Karen is my hero.  Yup.  

And Sarah, you need to stop hiking more than I do.  I'm starting to get jealous."

"event","OK, so Sarah wants to know how the writing is going.  Hmm, well, I got up nice and early today (7:30 am) despite wanting to sleep in because the elephants upstairs were being all active and stompy.  Then, for some reason, getting up, showered, dressed, and breakfasted took until 11am.  Cush had something to do with that, but it was mostly big bad me.  Then I made it to Mom's to work and enjoy the sunlight, and I finally got going, when there was a knock at the door.  I had a package from Brazil!!  Yup, my friend sent me Brazillian booze!  So I'm one happy camper today.  I love packages!!  I'd squeal like a Tosc right now if I could!  Alas, now I must return to the diss and try to get through at least this one section today.  It's important, it's difficult, I'm edgy, but wish me luck.  Then, tomorrow, I'm turning in this chapter to my dad to look over, so that will be majorly angsty time for me.

As a treat tonight, I shall swim!

And as for eating, well, me = big pig today.  
Oatmeal for breakfast (tad bit of sugar, but otherwise healthy) with calcium fortified OJ
Leftover chicken and rice for lunch
handfull of chocolate chips (bad bad bad Susan!!!)
So I think salad for dinner tonight, if I can make myself do it."

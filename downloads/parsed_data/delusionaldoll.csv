"event","Ok so heres a look into my world.... Anything and everything that can go shitty has... My cell phone is turned off because my bill was 600.00, which would be no problem if I was working full time still but since I'm not... um yeah big problem.... which means I can't talk to the people who are important to me... which in turn leads to paranoia... especially when I get nosy and see things I shouldn't... My trust level for three very important people to me has dropped significantly... I guess it goes to show that everyone is a fair weather friend... specially when you are around alot to entertain them and give them what they want from you... but when your life is shit or things go wrong and you can't be all about them they screw you over....  *sigh bitch whine moan*   

I just spent the last four nights at the hospital with my mom and haven't slept... My brain is running a mile a minute with all kinds of random negativity...kinda like the cartoons when they are just in a world of shit and they have the dark cloud over their head... that's me!  eh what else??????  

I was trying to think of something positve but fuck it.... I don't care!"

"event","OK so the thought of the day is this.... how do you measure your worth?
Do you measure your worth by how many friends you have or how much money you make?  Or maybe you place more importance on education or life experience.  I measure my worth in how honest I am with myself and others, so of course my worth changes daily...Have you ever noticed that there are some people who lie constantly just to get through the day because they place so much importance on the opinion of others.  I try everyday not to be one of those people... then I go over to my mothers... we all do it.. lie to mom and tell her how well your doing just so she won't be judgemental and tell you nicely how much you suck but she still loves you...hehe.. anyway what else?

o0oo this job I applied for rescheduled my in-person interview, which i took as a bad sign..however..they called around 5 and asked if I could start in two weeks!  So I guess my phone interview went well enough.. who knows..perhaps they are just toying with me...BASTARDS!!!!!

Other than that nothing new to report...god I'm random...

"event","What is a broken heart you ask,
is that what your wanting to know?
You mean you've never been hurt
so bad that you always felt down and low?
A broken heart hurts more than anything ever could.
I can't believe you've never had one, I hope you never should.
A broken heart is wishes and dreams that never come true,
a goal in life never accomplished or losing someone dear to you.
A broken heart is a friendship that breaks apart too fast.
A broken heart is loving someone and them not loving you back.
It's an endless pain from your heart, deep within your soul.
It's an agony I hope you'll never know.
A broken heart is a hope that breaks right in two.
My broken heart is one word,
that word is simply,   You



UGH wtf is up with this mood I'm in.... I need to stop lmao"

"event","Ok so where do I start... don't you hate it when you mean that metaphorically and someone always has to chime in with ""start at the beginning""... screw that I don't wanna type that much... heh.  

So I'll start with my thought of the day..eh..week.  I am destined to be the number two, second pick, ""he can't have what he really wants so he'll settle for me"", girl.  Seriously it seems to be the card that was dealt to me.  And yes I know your drooling for the example but I'm not gonna open up about that one just yet...

I've also made the decision that if I am going to keep up with this whole journal thing that I'm going to make all of them public...who know maybe I'll acquire a following!

So I'm sitting at work and being bored as usual.  I've done my 15 minutes of actual work and its only 3am... nothing to do till 5 *sigh*.. I'm full of random thoughts and bored as all get out... but luckily I have a friend and fellow insomniac to keep me company so time will go a lil faster and it doesn't hurt that hes just way too sexy to be ignored..heh.. anyway I think I'm done for now but I'm sure as my female hormones ebb and flow I'll get more interesting.. (ugh I used flow smh)

So g'night for now <3"

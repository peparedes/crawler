"event","I just found out that a friend of mine is in a Mental Hospital because she had a Mental Breakdown. Im so worried about her and I cant call her because she doesnt remember anyone or anything half the time. I guess it happened because of a girl at school, ex-boyfriend and other stuff. I know the girl who played a factor in this and shes not exactly the nicest person at times, and shes FAKE. I wish there was something I could do.

"event","Well I dont really know where to begin so i guess I'll just start off by saying that I cannot trust ANYONE anymore. The only friends I have are the ones in this group and its plain to see that some people are obviously not my friends. I dont understand why people cant talk to their friends about stuff that happens. I understand that it may bring back bad memories, but isnt that what friends are for? To help each other out? Thats what Ive always thought. I seem to always get in trouble no matter where I go or what i do, which leaves me to the conclusion of me not talking about anything that happens anymore. whoever it is thats stabbing me in the back Id like you to come forward and tell me so that we can talk about it. So please if your the one, TELL ME!"

Everything is just getting to me big time and yet I cant talk about it to anyone because the only friend I do have here is going through a family dispute, and the friends that I have in the group dont want to hear about it cause I apparently have ""Drama"". So from now on Im holding everything in, and its eating away at my insides causing me to break down. I just dont know how long i can hang on."

"event","Well I just recieved a phone call from a friend of mine saying that she was going to pack up all her things and leave and live out of her car because there is going to be a HUGE fight at her house because her brother is going to kill their father cause they think he is cheating on their mother. This is all because a woman was leaning up against my friends father and he was apparently rubbing her thighs, which I didnt see, I just saw her leaning up against him. I just dont know what to do anymore and Im running out of ideas."

"event","Today I went to see a guy who offered me a modeling contract. I was so happy, thinking this was my time to shine, and when I got there I walked in with a smile. When I talked to the guy and started asking questions he began to creep me out by saying things like how beautiful I was and how sexy I looked. I asked him what would be involved in the modeling and he had began by saying small jobs such as catelouge modeling and for other projects, then he asked me if I would be interested in posing nude. I told him that was out of the question and he laughed and said he was just joking. Then he started talking about some of the first jobs I would be doing (catelouge, and store posters). I became more intersted as he went on but then became uncomfortable again when he AGAIN mentioned posing nude. He told me that no one would see the pictures but him and I and offered me $20,000 to do it. I told him that again I was not interested and that he was making me feel uncomfortable, he put his arm around my waist and told me that he had a lot of models who felt that way at first but once they got into it they love it. I pushed him away and told him that I ABSOLUTELY would NOT do it and he said that it was my loss and that if I wouldnt do it then I wasnt  getting paied the $1000 we signed for when he took trial pictures of me the day before (which may I add were FULLY CLOTHED). I just dont know what to do. Part of me feels like I did the right thing, but yet part of me is saying I should go back and tell him Ill do it. Also Im upset about the fact that hes refusing to pay me the money that we signed for in the contract for when he did a ""first shot"" processing. Im only 16 and I dont know how to fight this, Can anyone help me out here?

"event","well I took off last night, couldnt handle the pain anymore. I just cant stay in a place where secrets arent good ones. Im not saying where I am right now, in case Ryan reads this. But I took the babies and left, I didnt want them to be around the abuse. But anyway, enough of that lets get on to something more interesting. 
I told the guy I have a crush on that I like him....even though he IS married.  but I also told him that I don't want to ruien his marriage, so what do you say? Lets just call it a friendship??? I think I can handle that. I was listening to my JC Chasez cd last night as I was laying in bed and when a certain song came on it made me really think. below are the lyrics.....Thanks JC.....its a great song, and I think Im about to turn my life around.

Clear my eyes it's the morning after
Did I fall in love, or did I find disaster?
Take a second just to breathe
I pick my heart up off my sleeve, yea

There she goes and I know she knows
By the way she eased out on her tippy toes
Skip the breakfast, tea for two
We made no plans to rendeavous, yea

Someone for everyone but no one for me
(No one for me)
Constantly searching for the love I need to

Build my world around, around
I'll be the lonely one until I find someone
The one I build my world around, around
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world...

Lazy days, I'm in a hazy phase
Of watching countless ways in which my life goes crazy
Foolishness to blame
Still it pains me all the same, yea

Empty faces with empty gazes
In a race of change I'm losing faith in my pace
Trying to keep my feet before I fall

I'm on this endless road with nothing to see
(Nothing to see)
Constantly searching for the love I need to

Build my world around, around
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one I build my world around, around
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world

A cornerstone of honesty
(All around)
A foundation of gravity and freedom
(All around)
A clear and concrete understanding
(All around)
A love that's best kept safe and sound

It's amazing how we fear we may be
It's from ourselves we so often run
Abandon fear and consequence of heartbreak
Expose the truth and give yourself to love

We've all been set up to be disappointed
We have to crawl before we learn to fly
It's a blur that moves right into focus
Removes the doubt, aligns your heart and mine

Build my world around, around
(It's amazing, ah yea)
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one I build my world around, around
(Around, around, yea)
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world around, around
(Around, yea, oooh...)
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one I build my world around
(Just say it, just say it, just say it, just say it, yea-yea, oh baby)
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world..."

When your problems just seem to get to the point where you dont know what to do anymore, can you run from them? I believe you can, but they wont go away no matter how fast you run. If this is the casse, then what do you do to get rid of them? Someone help me. Bev, if you read this, we need to talk about YOU KNOW WHO!!!!

"event","Well folks by the weekend, we will be moving to Florida and I cannot wait. I will still be a part of RP so dont worry, Im not going anywhere. Although I know there are some people in this group who would just LOVE to see me leave, but im not backing down this time, so you all can just deal with it. I dont ask for anyone to like me, I just ask for respect, and if you cant give me that, then SCREW you all. I just think it is so stupid how people can be so rude to a person the DAY that they join the group and all. Also, sending out rude emails is wrong too. Everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect, Im sure all of you have made mistakes before, and you dont see me judging anyone. 
Anyway enough about that, I have to go now so that I can finish packing. Talk to you all later. 
Love, Kaytie Bear"

"event","Well its my 16th Birthday, and things couldnt get better. I got my liscence and then was surprised by seeing that Ryan had gotten me my Metallic blue mustang convertable...Im gonna take good care of it. Now if only I had the guts to tell the guy I like that I like him, although I know deep in my heart that I shouldnt cause hes married. Maybe I should talk to him and his wife, tell them how I feel and then tell them that Im just gonna back off, cause I really dont wanna mess things up. Yeah maybe thats what Ill do. Hopefully that wont make things bad between them, cause Id feel horrible if I was the reason for them fighting."

I dont know how to tell him how I feel, cause Im afraid that if I do, it will get back to his wife and she'll kick the shit out of me. Chances are this guy will see this and my secret will be out of the bag, but like I said i just dont know what to do. Someone please help.

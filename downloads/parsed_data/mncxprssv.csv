"event","I spent the night chewing off my lips and digging my dirty fingernails under the skin on my face. When I closed my eyes all I could hear was demonic laughter from all throughout the night; voices layered on top of one another and never ever pausing for a moment. I watched my companions sleep in the dark wishing one of them had heard the noise as well, but I remained awake and alone and insane. I never thought morning would come. I must quit this foolishness."

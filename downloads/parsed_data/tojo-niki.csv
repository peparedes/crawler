It was his son that raped me, it wasn't my fault. Now i feel horrible and have been feeling horrible all day, i'm so sick of being made feel like total shit, they don't know what i've been through and am going through.

Fuck them

Im off to excersise and paint. 

I'll speak to Iain about it later, he'll make me feel better."

"event","I keep going from feelings of recovery eating dinner and purging it. I feel very run down right now.

Im so so tired today, tired of everything and just plain tired lol. That man was in today and today was the worst incident ever. He came over to me and asked if i had the time and i showed him my arms and said no (hes foreign so i thought he wouldnt understand) i was myself and waiting on Iain. He grabbed my right arm and pushed it back to the wall and said ""see how strong you are. see show me"" and it fucking hurt. His whole hand fit easily over my wrist, i felt fucking fragile! He broke my bangle because he held on to it so tight. (it was the one Iain gave me) And he laughed and then walked past and i was shaking and wishing iain would hurry up and i was trying not to cry. Then the man came BACK and said ""why you waiting here?"" and i told him i was waiting on someone, he asked who, i said my boyfriend and he said ""oh you have boyfriend? any room for more sorry sorry"" and i was like no. then he walked away and came BACK AGAIN and said ""all those boys do is smoke"" and then ""so you have boyfriend,"" ""yes""(me) ""any room for more boys?????"" and i was like ""no!"" god what the fuck do i look like?!!! (slut i guess) so he walked away and then Iains friend run past me and said ""alright?"" and i smiled and nodded. he past and i was nearly in tears, terified and shaking because this guy might come back. The finally Iain came round the corner and i ran and cuddeled him and i was shaking so bad and he was really worried and kept asking if i was ok and his friends all walked past (i think they heard) and i was trying so hard not to cry and i cuddeled and hid my face and iain was really angry at the guy. then i turned around and the guy was at the top of the corridor looking down at us and started walking towards us so iain seen him and took my hand and pulled me round the corner and around the other route, we got to the top of the hall and there he was AGAIN so iain (being a quick thinker) pulled me in to the shop. 

Then we went to his car, he asked if i was ok and i shook my head cause im not. I didn't want to push him away again like i had whenever it happened before so i told him i felt horrible and slutty. He took me a drive and calmed me down, he was so sweet about it. He listened as i called the guy all the names under the sun and we stopped and he cuddeled me and told me he loved me.

I went and reported it too my college lecturer today, she told me to write it out and i might need to identify him, im so so scared to do that but it needs to be done,

So an eventful day. Iain was so special to me today though, i'll phone him later and tell him how much i love him. 10PM cause hes at football all night. I wish he didn't play football sometimes but its only one day a week, i guess i can live with anxiety for a few hours.

""but what if he gets tired from f/ball and drives home and crashes...."""

Im 112 lbs, i want to be...108/110 for Iains birthday because his Aunts and Uncles will be there and yeah...I just want it. 

Its nearly three pm. I haven't studied yet, i will later, maybe before and after dinner all the way up until Iain comes over.

I've done 30 minutes of tap today and im going to skip for half an hour and probably sex later, Iain told me he wants too so i'll take it how it goes. 


I wont lose weight sitting here typing so im going to go skip for a while and then study. <3"

"event","I feel like giving up right now. With most things, with driving lessons - they seem to be a waste of time and not helping seeing as im a ""poor"" driver and can't concentrate on the road well enough. Driving just doesn't interest me. Big deal.


With college because i hate English class, i like the subject, but the teachers a moron and for the past 6 months has failed to devise at least a structured lesson plan for the week. We go from a play to a novel to a poem in the space of a week; un finished. Un fucking known. How am i supposed to pass the essay exam when i don't know how to write an essay on a certain play or poem. I sure as hell aint going to write it on the novel, that novel is the dullest piece of shit ever written and he chooses <b>that</b> Maths is now hard. What a change, i went from being able to do absolutly everything in maths to <i>nothing</i> in the past week. There is just <b>no</b> point to modern studies and Biology is now about the same as maths. How intelligent do i fucking feel.

Sleeping, yes, lets give up on sleeping too. All i do is have nightmares.

Oh shes in one of <i>those</i> moods.

Iain still hasn't told me whether he liked or <i>hated</i> the poem i spent fucking days making. Probably wont speak to him tonight either. He probably wont come over on Friday because his mums ill. I hate love sometimes, i wish i could make everything better but i can't.

I got retainers and they make me talk with a lisp. They hurt. Im supposed to wear them 24/7 but i refuse to wear them outside, im not going to fucking talk like a moron for the sake of perfect teeth. Fuck that.

So far ive had one cookie today. Its 12pm and im of to college until 4pm. Go Niki. She can't even manage breakfast or lunch. No one caressss. 

I just want to crawl under my covers and dissapear. Bye bye, auf wiedersehen, au revoir, Ce la vie, ciao, sionarra, goodbye."

"event","Hello,

Im new here, i know one person, Amelia. (Shes <b>awsome</b>)

I don't know where to start really, i've had a past, as do we all, maybe a little more complicated than others - but a past none the less. I've been through a lot and with the help of my boyfriend and Amelia i'm still here to tell the tales. Maybe i'll save that for anothere entry though, i don't want to get all hot and heavy on entry number one.

I have brown, (now its <sup>short</sup>) hair and my eyes change according to mood. (from blue to brown to green and now yellow) It's a weird funky ole' trait of mine but i like it! 

I'm going to be really corny now and tell you that my fave colour is yellows, teal green, pinks and anything light. I'm a happy crazy girl in my head, i don't have the energy to show it outwardly. I <b><u>enjoy</b></u> getting lost in a book, i like showers better than baths and you may find it hard to believe, but i also like to wear odd socks to college.

I am Anorexic, but i DON'T like it, it's one of the worst things anyone should ever have to deal with. I do continually try to break out of this but too many things happen and at the moment i've kind of given up. I will try again soon though, just going to wait until i have a clear mind and the strength.

I go to college at the moment, i only have three months left until i leave and start a new one. Ultimatly i want to be a primary teacher. Its my dream.

I hope to meet nice new people here, be <i>nice</i> to me. I'm a nice preson really i promise lol.
:O)"

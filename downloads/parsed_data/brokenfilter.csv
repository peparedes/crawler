It's so hard to get to work. It's cold and miserable here and TX was warm and happy. I miss mom and dad so much, and I want so bad to move down there and work with mom in real estate. Find a cute house with a big yard where we can do our halloween display. But Sean won't even consider it. So I cry everyday... he suggest we find a nicer climate in a city we can both like. North Carolina seems promising... but still San Antonio would be so nice."

Polymyositis diagnosis about 2 weeks ago, rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis in March earlier this year. I thought getting a diagnosis would be good and get me on the road to feeling better.

"event","Sometime in december last year I started to have weakness and pain in my hands. They were swollen and I couldn't wear my wedding ring anymore. After 4-6 weeks of the pain not subsiding I finally went to my doc. She sent me to get some tests and to see a specialist. 

After my 3rd visit and some trial and error, I've been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I cried the first time I heard that, and I'm still feeling sorry for myself. But I'm hopeful. At this point in time, I just hope the treatment works and I can get rid of the constant pain and swelling (which sometimes keeps me up at night.)

Things could be worse. Today I heard about a 27 year old woman with bone and breast cancer. So, giving myself a shot a week isn't bad. The idea of having deformed clawed hands that are fairly useless is pretty scary. You have no idea how much you take your hands for granted until it hurts to open a door, or you can't open a can of pop, or it hurts to hold a pen.

"event","So, last night I made a confession to Sean that was really burdening me... I felt like such a BAD person. I and everyone always joke that I have no heart, because I don't have a whole lot of empathy for others.

But this... I didn't expect to be so shallow.

I told him that even though I was a little sad to have miscarried, I was mostly GLAD and relieved. I didn't want to be pregnant, I didn't want a baby, I didn't want the burden. But everyone else was so happy when they found out I was pregnant even though I was feeling ambivelant, and so sad when I lost it and I was feeling glad, that I felt I had to go along.

What pressure!

I figured I'd start getting baby-momma feelings once I saw the ultrasound/heard the heartbeat. But I was terrified that I would go months and still not want the baby.

It kind of makes me wonder... did I miscarry because I didn't want the baby, or did I not form an attachement to the baby because somehow I knew I would miscarry??

Sean was incredibly understanding. He'd been looking forward to the  baby so much that I was afraid he'd think I was the worst kind of person. But he said he wasn't surprised and totally understood. On some level, I already knew he knew I was relieved, but I didn't think he'd be ok with me being GLAD about it.

So I've gotten back on the pill, even though everyone thinks we should keep trying (we weren't really trying to begin with), but I'm really NOT ready to get pregnant... scary."

Normally, I would vote democrat because I think republicans are a bunch of judgemental, bible-thumping closed-minded bigots. But from what I preliminarily know about Guiliani, I am very tempted. From what I understand, he supports abortion rights, gay rights, and gun control. Plus, he did some great things with getting New York to be a more liveable place. And I tell you, his appearance on SNL when he was Mayor puts him in a totally different category from other candidates.

Conversation part 1:
Guy: Yeah, I know these people through my dad.
Sean: Who's your dad?
Guy: R****
Sean: Oh, I know him! What a great guy! How's he doing?
Guy: He died of cancer.

Conversation part 2:
Guy: I used to live in California. My wife and I had a house out there, but a bunch of crack fiends move in next door so we had to sell.
Sean: I'm sorry to hear that.... Is your wife here?
Guy: We're divorced.

I will however, be making pot stickers, jamaican beef patties, jerk chicken wings, strawberry crepes, chocolate chip-oatmeal cookies, and taco bar. I know it sounds like a great big nonsense conglameration, but this is all for 3 days of gaming.

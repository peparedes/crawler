Soap Operas.  The British are obsessed with them, especially ""Eastenders"".  For the uninitiated, it's a bunch of cockneys shouting at each other for half an hour 4 times a week.  The cast is made up of people who wouldn't be able to speak a coherent sentence of their own if it wasn't written down for them.

And it's got Barbara Windsor in it.  The cockney ""comedy"" actress who was married to an East End gangster and who, apparently, we all love and is an institution.  Should be in a fricking institution.

For those of you who don't know, East End gangsters are not cool like Robert De Niro in Casino.  They are the scum of the earth, and cockney to boot.

And the British are obsessed with it.  Perhaps it's why their own lives are so messed up......"

"event","Just got back from running my Pub Quiz where I've been struck by the realisation that I have a dirty foul mouth.  Why is this?

a) I love to shock people and be ""admired"" for going to the edge.

b) I have Tourettes bastard Syndrome.

c) Due to my puritan upbringing I've subconsciously decided to totally go the other way and be a bad man.

It's not big or clever to say ""cock"" over a microphone, is it now?
I might think about not doing it for a week, if I can be bothered.

"event","So here I am, doing all that logging in stuff you have to do, and I was thinking about what I could possibly write for my first log.

I was going to moan about Christmas being everywhere from October onwards, but a lot of people love that and I don't want to alienate anybody this early on.

What about the war on terrorism?  That's a very now subject.  Apparently it isn't a war against Islam, but how do we know that Islam isn't starting a war against everyone else?  Because they say so?  Because our leaders say so?  Riiiiiiiiight.  I'm going no further with that one as I have no wish to invoke a fatwa on myself.

Stupid people would be another good one.  One of my goals is to wipe out stupidity within 20 years, although this would involve bombing Stoke On Trent and Coventry, Britain's 2 stupidest cities.  But then I thought about the pub quiz I run on Sunday nights and how even the dumbest assed kids that join in really want to do well and learn and win prizes.  So that one's buggered.

So I'm not going to complain about anything today (not even my beloved Aston Villa Football Club), so I'll thank you for reading (comment if you can be bothered) and I'll speak to you soon.

First off I want to say sorry to the one person that I said I would never do it again and I did...you know what I mean and who you are. I am truely sorry and want you to know that you still mean ALOT to me and I do still love you. Let talk please.

Havent talked to Rachel in weeks as well since the surgery actually, and I really miss talking to her and being with her. Not sure how to approach her anymore. Not sure if she wants anything to do with me anymore. If she does great, but if she doesnt then I wish she would at least let me know.

In hind site...surgery went well and viccdine is great...was able to eat solid food about a week after the surgery, therefore I lost about 13 pounds....apparently 7up and sherbert are good for weight lose. Now that Im eating again, I probably gaind about 7 back. Basically the surgery was the removal of tonsils, tubes put in ears, and fixed a deviated setum (nose). The great side to it was that the biopsy of the tonsild came back negative...major plus for have been smoking for the last 15 years. The other plus side is that I quit smokeing ....been three weeks.

To you (you know who you are) again I am sorry and PLEASE PLEASE fogive me and lets work on it, and us."

I was supposed to meet some friends out last Friday night and unfortunatly I was in a car accident with my friend. His car got totalled and I spent several hours at St Lukes in the ER. Needless to say the friend that I was supposed to mete out that night was extremly pissed at me for standing her up. Which I didnt do intentionally.

Anyways....Tomorrow is surgery for me...kinda looking forward to it. The one thingI have come to realize, is that how will I know if I die during the surgery. Granted the surgery is only on my ears, mouth and nose, but there are always risks when it comes to being out under. Guess we'll find out...not that I plan on dieing...but just one of those ""Hmmmmm"" thoughts.

Met this girl last night (Sara). Jeff and I went to a strip joint. Needless to say shes a stripper. Shes hot, but what stripper isnt. Anyways she asked for my number which I gave her (cell phone) and surprisingly she called it last night around 1 am. Shes calling me back today....said that she wiould give me a ""private"" dance at her place......looking forward to it and I'll have to make sure I remember to write about it.

I realize that this entry is bounceing all over the place...but it is my journal...so deal with it......

Was online during the day yesterday as well...nothing new for me....and was talking to Tracy. Why is it that most women (I would say over 80%) wont admit that they  masturbate? I now know of at least 4 that do and they do regularly. Anyways..her yahoo profile actually states that she masturbates. Now I think it is very sensual, or erotic if you will, to watch a woman please herself, and an extreme turn on. Even better when Im tongue fucking a pussy or ass and she reaches down and starts rubbing her clit. So Tracy and I were talking and being as I am always naked at home, and 9 out of 10 times on cam...we cammed and got off together. We will get together in a couple weeks  for more of a live-up-front session....looking forward to that.

Today I have my last interview for Harley.....as long as I show up I will get the job....would be great to work there. The discount on a bike is outragous. Thats about it for now..."

"event","Well its been awhile since I wrote here and I have been pressured by someone to write...to to you...and you know who you are...here it is....

Not too much happening since I last wrote. I met rachel on Tuesday for lunch. Great lunch. We went back to her place and had a quickie. We didnt have alot of time do to the drive to her place and where she works...but it felt great to be inside her again.

I called and found out that I aill be going to the sleep wellness center this Friday for a study. Damn Sleep apnia. Actually kinda looking forward to it, as its one step closer to the surgery that I know I need. Never really understood why I was always tired after getting 7-10 hours of sleep...now I know, and will know more after Monday. I have an appointment with the Doc on Monday...mainly because I still cant hear the greatest in both ears. So there may be another surgery there as well, we'll see. Thank god for insurance. lol.

Heather finally showed up today on messenger. She said she needed to talk to me, but wouldnt say anything else. I know that she is having issues with her 42 yo BF (shes 25). I cant compalin..I just broke up with a 19 yo and Im 35....what can I say I like them young, and thick. :D The last time I talked to her though, she said that if I didnt hear  from her by Wednesday, I should call her at her mom's...needless to say I did and she wasnt there. The other thing she said today was that after I had asked here how it was goping...she said something to the extent of not good....so It will be interesting.

I have come to the conclusion of one thing..I need some friends here in Milwaukee. Jeff and Amy are having a kid...just found out yesterday....Im happy for them...but since he's gotten married...we havnt hung out like we used to. I also need a steady GF. SOmoen who like what I like. Someone whos adventurous. Someone who likes sex, likes to be licked and like to be outdoors. Ususally I would like them to like golf...but I can forget that part. Hey what can I say Im a exhibitionist, as welll as a voyour. Rachel is great and we have a great relationship, but I wold like some female that I can share with her. SOmeones whos bi or bi curious. Best of both worlds..:D

Well more later...need to finish stroking......"

"event","Well what can I say...We must have gotten about 13 inches of snow....it sucked.

Well i was up late last night nad I think it worked out but we'll see. I was in a chat room on Yahoo and started chatting with the woman from Sheboygan (Heather). Needless to say I think we hit it off..kinda. She is involved in a LTR with a man who is married still but lives with Heather. When I started talking with her, she said that she was looking for friends. Thats cool...can always use them...but being I was in a horny mood, and was working on stroking for the 4th time yesterday...I asked her if it was friends with benefits....she said that it would depend, and see where it goes.

So needless to say, she saw me on cam, and being a nudist as much as I can, I of course was naked. She only saw me from the shoulders up, but assumed that I was naked. As it turns out..we have alot in common...she loves being naked as much as I do, loves to receive oral, and I love giving it, likes the fact that Im sahved, and has had and wants more bi-activity. She is also cool and excited about me being bi as well. She sent me some pics...she has big tits...and love to have her nipples sucked. She also loves anal...she says she cums the best that way. COOL.

Well at the very least we will be friends...on the plus side we will be friends with benefits. We'll see what happens. We will probly meet this week for lunch or something.

I also talked to Rachel last night. She was online as well. Would love to see Rachel and Heather together...with me in the middle of course. Rachel was in a good mood for being stuck at home...she didnt want to go out in the snow. I dont blame her. We talked a little bit about lunch this week as well...but nothings confirmed...would love to see her again...feeling her mouth arong my cock...or better yet, tasting her pussy  again......that sweet shaved pink pussy.......mmm mmm good....."

"event","Well i made it to the urgent care Dr. last week for my ears...they have been plugged for the last couple weeks. The dr said that I have fluid behind my eardrum...While doing her normal exam bullshit, she said that my tonsils are extremly enlarged...being the sarcastic person that I can be, and sexual as well...I said thankyou...she didnt get the meaning...

She did say that I should see an ENT, which is what I did yesterday. This Dr said the same thing..only this time I didnt say what I wanted, being as it was a he and not a she. Well needless to say...I have sleep apnia,so I am going to get scheduled for a sleep study and then surgery to have my tonsils ( the ones in my mouth) removed (meaning I will still be able to have kids, just not any time soon). After that surgery I will be schedule for another one for a deviated setum..dont ask me to explain that one....So I'll take it one day at a time......."

Met Rachel last week for lunch...well I should say she had a Protien lunch from me....what can I say...she is good......It actually brought back memories of the first time she sucked me off....and the second, and the third ......well you get the picture. I picked her up from work and we went for a little drive...found a park and started talking...needless to say...I had to kiss her. Again the memories came back and to tell the truth, I almost forgot what I was doing.To make this a little shorter, she went down on me in the truck, broad daylight and drained me. It was greatcant wait to see her again. Maybe she will snowball again...we'll see."

"event","First off let me say that I am extremly disappointed in the packers.....makes me wish I wasnt at the game...but hey......I was and I cant complein too much...was in a box...

So anyways..I said that i would finish explaining my meet with rachel so here it is....

Like I had said...Rachel came into the sjhower while I was in there, and was just talking to me. I didnt think too much of it, especially being as Im a guy...but I couldnt remember if I was bare when we were together last or not...but what did I care...if I wasn't then she would have to get used to it...if she didnt like it....

<Pause>...I have decided several years ago that my life was going to my life and I was going to live it the way I wanted to...meaning that I have no inhibitions, and I like to be naked...not to mention naked outdoors....I do frequent the nude beach in Madison and I little place in Racine that I found that has some very secluded areas for nude tanning...there are times there that I wish I had some company :D.


Needless to say when I was finished with my shower, I opened the curtains and wiped the water from my eyes and then looked sittiing on the tolit holding a towel, as she was looking at me...I had gotten semi-hard thinking about her sitting in there while I was in the shower.

When our eyes met....she had this look that was so hypnotising, so sensual and erotic it was incredable. She has beautiful eyes and tender lips...soft yet forceful...and at times...very very  sexy. 

She got up and walked towards me and before I could reach for the towel, she dropped and reached for me and kissed me....my wet body pressed against her clothed on....

To say that what happened next wasnt special...would be to lie...it almosted seems like it was our first time...so sexual. The details here are insignificant, but thats not to say that thy're arent plenty. 

We must have went at it a good five times that night. She didnt even make it to work...which was fine by me....breakfast------>her...:D

Not sure where this will end up going, relationship wise....but we will see...all I know is that I dont want to fuck things up again, and if we dont become bf/gf...then hopefully we can still have a sexual relationship.....regardless...there will always be feelings for her, and I just hope she knows that...."

"event","This is a late entry but at least Im making it. I will try to make this long story short, and leave out some details.

Met Rachel Thursday night after volleyball.....it was so great to see her again. I called her about 9:30 ish after the game, which we only won one out of three. I told her that I was on my way, but was really sweaty and asked to use her shower before we went anywhere, which she said fine.

When I Arrived at her apartment I will have to admit I was nervous as hell, but she ease all of theat when she came to the door to answer it. Im glad she did...all she really had to do was buzz me in...but she walked down and opened the door....Once inside the foyer, I leaned in to hug her which she accepted, but then she leaned and gave me a kiss....I was hoping for that, but just not that early in the night.

We made it into her apartment and she showed me the bathroom and handed me a towel. I semi closed the door, started the water and got undressed and jumped in. I was still nervous so I decided to take a long one, just to ease it a little....she came in while I was in the shower and we talked about this and that.

To make it even shorter....we never left the aprtment...and I didnt leave till the next morning. 

I have to run now and do some errands...but I will explain more later..."

Been chatting with an old friend of mine (Rachel)...cant wait to see her again...Hopefully next week some time. We had some good times together...but I fucked them up. She had great eyes and a good sense of humor...but she sucks at playing pool....I think we're goping to meet for lunch next week...the plus side is that its north of Milwaukee in Mequon..which means not as much snow...I hope.


I can remember the first time we met...and the first time we kissed...she has soft lips, on both ends. She's a bbw and she had cut her long hair...which I almost cried about...but she says that she growing it back. It was always great sex with her. Definently looking forward to seeing her again even if nothing happenes. I can hope for at least a kiss from her...and if more happenes than I wont complain."

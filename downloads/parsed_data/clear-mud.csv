"event","we headed to monteverde with the intention of exploring a new climate and resting. chris had an inner ear infection that made activity very strenuous and we had been living in teepees and moldy cabins with cold water the past 3 weeks, so we decided to splurge and spend 12 dollars each for a hotel with internet, free breakfast, hot water, and all the tea and coffee you can drink. we took long, lavishing showers and headed into town to explore. by far monteverde was one of the best places we had been, located so high in the mountains the clouds would swarm into the town creating an eerie fog throughout the streets. we stayed in that night, drank cuba libres, and played countless amounts of shithead and euker with two guys we met from new york. jessi was a recent graduate in p.a., which came in handy with chris ear, was very light hearted and his friend steve was a goofy guy that had a similar lust for travel. the next day we relaxed more, thought about doin one of the expensive tours but vouched against it and wandered the town again and grabbed groceries to make fajitas and tortilla soup for our friends. the next day we got on the jeep boat jeep to la fortuna with 2 families that had also been at the hotel. one couple had a kid uri from israel which they fed loads of candy and continually bounced around. we finally arrived with the site of the enormous active volcano arenal billowing smoke from its peak into the surrounding sky giving a similar donnie darko feel. when we arrived we stayed in a hostel called grungo petes for 5 dollars a night. it was cozy, colorful, and within 10 minutes chris and i got into one of the biggest arguments ever. he decided to storm off to a bar and i decided to pierce my nose. after a few hours he returned to the hostel where i had drunkenly made friends from israel, canada, and switzerland. we resolved the fight immediately and talked to the friends from the table about parties in bc, israeli armies, and travel. soon they had their dinner ready and were courteous to share their shish ke bobs and cucumber salad with us. the next day we woke up and ventured to the swimming hole, on the way we stopped for a breakfast and decided to rent bikes. we rode the clunky, mountain bikes to the swimming hole and tied them up. it was a beautiful oasis with large rocks and water billowing over their tops. also there was the largest rope swing i have ever seen. we lounged on the rocks and watched local ticos flip and swing into the water until our friends from the hostel randomly showed up. so we all hung out and shared good times and took pictures of the various swings into the water. after good times with everyone chris and i decided to make our way to the waterfall..."

"event","due to the hangover our travels began later then expected. we decided the day before that instead of taking a bus that routed almost 3 hours around our destination (mal pais) we would cut straight through the mountains with our packs which was only 2 hours. it was strenuous with several steep inclines and declines along with 30 more or less packs but it was what we had been craving. i think in those 2 hours we traveled to a completeley different climate as well as passed mel gibsons house, errr enormous pompous gate. when we arrived our backs and feet ached and we found refuge in pacha mammas lodging aka a 3 story teepee we were referred to by mary. the place literally meaning mother earth was run by a german man named franz who had a lot of land along the coast for 5 years and in the past 2 had doubled in value. therefore making franz very relaxed and let us stay for 5 dollars a night. that night we mostly walked through the town to check out the sites and ate the worst chinese food known to man kind. after the disappointment we returned to the teepee and climbed up the side of a hill foreshadowing the teepee to a giant platform resting atop the giant trees overlooking the sea and beyond. we read aloud to each other and watched as the sun drifted aimlessly beyond the abyss. the next day we woke up early and ate at a small soda up the street then walked along the shoreline to a common surf spot. we rented a long board for 10 dollars the whole day and took turns drowning in the sea. chris got the hang of it and stood a few times, i was a slower learner however. reguardless, i can see myself becomming involved in more surfing in the future. as the sun began to fade we moved upshore to a couple of brewskys then made our way into town for food. we went into a restaurant with a fire ablaze in the front, which should have been the first clue for a tourist trap, we ordered two sandwhiches, 1 fish 1 chicken. when they were ordered they were on wonderbread and my chicken was the nasty run offs from the fit}re or something. it definitely would have made me sick so i didnt eat it and it cost 7 dollars which is very expensive for costa rica. sooo i left with an empty stomach and unsatisfied opinion of mal pais. we headed home exhausted from surf all day and a yinge of sickness from travel and climate change. the next day we slept in, ate breakfast, and planned on leaving the touristy city but ended up staying due to lack of knowledge with the bus schedule. still run down from the day before we crawled back and took a nap and freshened up. we stumbled back into town to watch my favorite movie (big lebowski) topped off with delicious ruso blancos. sleepy from cocktails and a good date we took a cab home and made plans for the next city, monteverde."

"event","so we stepped off the bus and onto a long driveway leading us halfway up a mountain. once we entered the gate it looked like a minature rainforest with small paths into wild brushes and animals around every corner. we soon read all the required documents and introduced ourselves to the various volunteers. after feeding all the animals and giving them necessary antibiotics we followed everyone even further up the hill to the farm and housing (huts). the animals in the sanctury included several parrots and various birds, 3 very pesky blue jays, an anteater (anti), a white faced monkey (tarzan), a kinkajou (kinky), a baby skunk (sissy),a baby howler monkey (mona lisa), several turtles, 2 baby squirrels, 2 rabbits, porquipines,  guineau pigs and feliz the toucan. when we arrived at the farm we found several annoying chickens, various birds, this evil creature named knipper that all pamphlets make look adorable, and an ocelot. once we were acquainted with the place we plcaed our things in the honeymoon hut situated in the treetops of the jungle. mary the coordinator had two programs a volunteer could do, work stay where you lived in the hut for free and worked 6hours of work or work pay where you lived down the street in a jungalow for a discounted rate 7 dollars each and work 4 hours. we had a three day trial to where we were eatin alive by bugs and had no time to do anything but work from 8 to 11 then 2 to 5. so we decided to use the jungalows that were run by ed, a funny guy from holland, our jungalow was equipt with a cold water shower and kithen below along with several noisy monkeys swinging from branch to branch 100 feet above us. the day after we arrived at rainsong a going away party was arranged for some of the departing volunteers, so come around 12 o clock every rondevoud at the beach to join in celebration of pina coladas, weed, and sun. after that day life seemed to slow down and we were able to set into a comfortable routine. every day we would wake at 8 and walk to the site and take care of various animals, i became fond of anti the ant eater while chris the baby monkey mona. many of the animals were injured due to the electric lines of costa rica. its a huge issue currently because the country refuses to insulate the lines and several animals are being electricuted. tarzan only had 1 arm due to them, one of the blue jays died because of it, and a monkey died upon arrival from it. anyway, after taking anti to search for ants and lounge with her in the sun, i would make her yogurt breakfast and medicate her tail. when 12 o clock rollec around we would head back and either relax in hammocks drinking rum and eat mangos accompanied by a book or head to the beach and childlessly splash around in our young love. we also became friends with a couple of spanish vets, vanessa and jose luis, they were young, lively, and a lot of fun. everything was going smooth until a member who had been there since january ran into trouble with mary (the coordinator) apparently the girl christine had needed a couple of days to clear her head to various reasons and mary wouldnt have it. she made her pack her things and leave so she came to one of the jungalows where we were staying to calm down and regain a clear mind. a couple of days later she calls ed and says that he must tell her to evacuate or she wont send him any more volunteers (which keeps him afloat in the low season) therefore leaving him no choice. after hearing this information we decided to cut our stay short, soon the spanish couple also left and 2 of the coordinators a girl liz from new zealand and coral from california also made arrangements to leave early. after the vets left a new couple from new york moved in. they were also fun and  before we left we ventured to the beautiful waterfalls of montezuma with them. cecilia was also a nutrition major and boyfriend travis was goofy and kindhearted. unfortunately we were seperated after the first waterfall but we both made it to the part at seperate times. the next day was our last day and ed and bob threw a party for us. bob was a funny old man that made honey wine and did an hour headstand every morning, he always had something short and witty to say. everyone slammed shots and danced to reggaetron most the night and we woke bright and early hung over to journey to our next destination."

"event","so we hopped on the ferry and sailed across the little strip of water that kept us from the shores of montezuma. once we arrived, the sky was dark and we were presented with the option of taking a taxi, so we accepted and shared with another traveling couple. the man, also chris from canada and marrisa from france traveled in large scales and put the expeditions in our small lives to shame. after a 45 minute drive over underdeveloped roads and tropical terrain we arrived in the picturesque town of montezuma. at first glance it seemed like a haven with rasta flair, bright lights outlining every building, and craft tables in front of every shop. but as we looked closer tourism was the main draw to this town and every overpriced shop and restaurant depended on the overflow of unappreciative, mostly american tourist. its not that i hate tourists, its just how they treat people and the land. most of them buy 4 wheelers and whip through town or buy sodas and restaurants and serve the same shitty indistinguishable food as america and get quadruple the amount. but anyway, we decided to camp on the beach where we met jandi a young rasta, luis the leathermaker from brazil, and am older rasta lady with a contagious laugh. we all spoke broken spanglish, smoked costa rican herb, and communicated by music from the tiny ipod on the table filled with english songs. as the night drew to an end we piled into a tent they offered and slept through the first heavy storm since we had been there. the next morning we woke up and ate mangos off a near tree, packed up our things, and headed towards cabuya, rainsong sanctuary. as we walked we hitched a ride on the bus that took us to the entrance."

"event","This trip is by far the most interesting experience of my life. We arrived in to san jose the first night and stayed at the international backpackers hostel. There we ate the best carribean chicken i have ever had with rice and beans. next day traveled to sarchi to look at their crafts and ox carts, unfortunately our guide book sucks and the cabina they recommended had been closed for 2 or more years. so after a 15 minute conversation of broken spanglish she took us down the road to an older womans home who she proceeded to yell at. the woman told us to sit and be patient. so we did. 10 minutes later a boy on a road bike rode up and explained he lived in rhode island for 8 years and has cabinas. lucky break. the cabinas were beautiful and on the side of a river bed next to a mango tree and the boys father, the one armed man gave us the 411 of the place. we freshened up andwalked down the enormous hill into town and split a plate of arroz con pollo which was also delicious. then we ventured over to the huge ox cart which was abot 30 feet high, all hand painted. the next day we rode a bus to alajuela then san ramon, the city of presidents and poets. the town was full of locals. shops, n sodas. we made our way to a hotel, relieved our backs from the heavy packs, and weightlessly wandered the streets foreign to everything around the next corner. the middle of the day we craveda snack and bought aguacates (avocados) tortillas and limons (limes) and made tacos at a local market. on the way back to the hotel we walked into a bar and watched the costa rica vs america game. needless to say the rat going up and down the back wall received more cheers than america as costa rica scored a goal within the first 10 minutes. as we stumbled back home the streets wew busy with cheers and victory. the next day we made our way to punterenas to catch the ferry...will write later out of time"

"event","So, I had probably the best thanksgivings this year. Drove to dtown with erica after a good double/triple date thing and great night. When we got to wacko some crazy at subway started talking to us about bikes and factories that he more or less would stash our bodies in... creepy. Then we got to dallas and saw the rents, and my dad made me tote firewood around the house to make a firepit in the back which was pretty awesome. Then come thanksgiving day, my neighbor had a turkey bowl to where they played football and hosted a wine tasting. So me and my mom got nice and wasted with almost everyone in the town I havent seen for like 5 years before the family came over and attempted to make dinner while doin a drunken jig around the kitchen. Then my cousin comes and wants to smoke a joint. So we go over to where this family used to live next to me and roll and jay when my dad comes around the corner! Of course he sees the zig zag papers and lighter prepared to ignite greatness, and makes the comment, ""oh ganja eh?"" and so we're like uh, yeah, you want a hit? To which he refrains so we spark it, then he comes back around the corner and is like, well, i'll take a hit. So I got stoned with my pa and the feast was a lot more interesting. Then we clean up and me and my cousin sneak off to smoke another jay and eat pumpkin pie. Soon after Im ready to pass out from turkey and shwag and my cousin drags me to her friend katies house, where we proceed to smoke 4 more blunts! and watch a really weird movie that was way too long. Finally thats over and I come home and watch Iron Man with the folks which was really pretty awesome, plus the fact that I was geekin out the whole time. All in all a pretty festive holiday that was pretty awesome. Now I think im headin back to dtown in a few. Ciao LJ."

"event","Good halloween, on thursday me and Julianne rode our bikes to hole in the wall for a zombie walk which ended up having a cover charge, so we said f that mo, then rode on over to red 7 to this xXx HARDCORE xXx show hahaha, and this guy took off his mummy wraps and went crazy. Then woke up nice n late to the critical mass on friday and dressed up as a person that fell off their bike since I have ample amounts of fake blood. There were about 300-400 people all dressed up crazily, and I must've jinxed myself because I fell off my bike inthe roundabout scraping up the whole right side of my body, real smooth. Then I though I lost my keys and tryin not to ruin halloween I decided to scale my balcony from my neighbors second floor onto the 3rd floor... terrifying all dressed bloody and whatnot, I always make great impressions. Then Chris came up and we made pizza and derick and erica came to join and eat and we all traveled downtown to look at the crazy scene. Then after we decided to stop paying for drinks we ventured to a party behind fiesta, wish the pun was intended, but really..Next day woke up and went to work from 12-7 and the ventilation system wasn't working :-/ so i breathed in a lot of smog and probably shortened my life a bit, then chris came up and we had a beer and went to oxblood. Took a few shrooms, watched a few bonfires, and played under the awesome stars :-). It's nice cause life is always completely at ease with him and I hope that never changes. Then we slept in my car and drove back in the mornin and took a long nap to rest off the night before. After we went to the river and I showed him this meditation trick that was hard to convince him to do, then we stole pumpkins out of peoples yards to carve and make pumpkin seeds by the fire. This whole weekend I felt almost like a little kid in love and I wouldnt have it any other way. :-) Now back to school/work but soon thanksgiving... ciao!"

"event","The weight of the world is love
Under the burden of solitude,
under the burden of dissatisfaction

the weight, the weight we carry is love.

Who can deny? In dreams it touches the boy,
in thought constructs a miracle,
in immagination anguishes till born in human--

looks out of the heart burning with purity--
for the burdens of love, 

but we carry the weight wearily,
and so much rest in the arms of love at last,
must rest in the arms of love.

No rest withouth love,
no sleep without dreams of love--
be mad or chill obsessed with angels or machines,
the final wish is love
-- cannot be bitter, cannot deny,
cannot withhold if denied:

the weight is too heavy

--must give for no return as though is given in solitude in all excellence of its excess.

The warm bodies shine together in the darkness, 
the hand moves to the center of the flesh,
the skin trembles in happiness 
and the soul comes joyful to the eye--

yes, yes, thats what I wanted,
I always wanted,
to return to the body where I was born.

"event","ah man, i feel as though i don't know where to start or stop anymore. Life is pulling me into so many various directions that its hard maintaining the concept of true self. I'm living in four completely different worlds consecutively at the same time, and although I hope it will become easier to adjust to, I'm having a very difficult time doing so. I live at a co op to where everything is new and exciting, i meet a new ecclect person every day that is knowledgeable but also very naiive because they are young and inexperineced like myself. A broad spectrum of students that are very different in their own unique way but also very similar at the same time. I'm the girl that waits tables and cooks in the back at the same restaurant I've been at for a year and now its so comfortable that its trite and bland. Although I cannot quit because I would not be able to take on the load of learning a completely new menu and making more strange acquaintances. I'm the illusive girl at school that is one of the youngest in her class and even though my major should be a cinche i always go to school the first 2 weeks feeling frustratingly intimidated. I love my classes and my future always seems bright but sometimes I'm wondering if I'm making a horrible mistake, guess everything never permanent but I hate the thought of lost time. I'm the girlfriend of a boy whom i love very much and we genuinely care for each other, but i feel as though i'll always be his side project from his thriving ambition for music and work. I would never consider standing in the way of his drive for what he wants but at the same time, I don't know how long I can sit in a not so serious relationship that I have wanted to make work for months now. He's extremely good to me and we get along extremely well, but theres just something missing that I don't know if time can replace. I can put all my thoughts on paper(lj) but formulating how i feel into sentences in his presence seems like communications class all over again. I just wish that I could rewind back 3 months to where the rose colored lenses made everything seem wonderful and new, but I know that time would only bring me right back to where I sit with unending troubling thoughts again. I suppose this i just another one of those road blocks that every person comes to at the beginnng of a new (school) year and after they leave the comfortable portion of their life that they have fallen back on for so long. Even though I have logically pinpointed pros and cons repeatedly in my brain, sticking with everything I put myself into seems like the most mature and reasonable thing to do. I just hope this horribly feeling in my gut begins to disperse and let me sleep at night :-/"

"event","Aye, so my days at riverside are coming to a quick end. Today me and Greg painted my entire room with an overcoat and my mind feels slower from all the fumes... and i didn't even eat a paint chip. It's nice to always be moving but at the same time I know I am really going to miss living here and all the cool people I see on a regular basis. It's really refreshing to be able to ride my bike to work every day then come home and be able to have a brew by the river and a nice chat with worldly people that are from diverse backgrounds and don't talk about college classes and agendas every day. Tomorrow is my last day and I will be living with Greg for 2 weeks. I'm excited  because it will be nice to play house temporarily, but also kind of nervous, just because I feel like everything is happening very quickly, coming from the girl with commitment issues ha. I'm sure it will be fine and dandy since it's only a short time and we're both very laid back people. Then I am off to the 21st street co op. It's definitely going to be a crazy year between school, work and the co op, but I know it will be a fun experience. On another note, I just got back from volunteering for bonnaroo a couple of weeks ago. Also very amazing, I left on June 6 to build a gigantic lite brite! It was so fuckin awesome, a pain in the ass the build but it turned out really cool. It was 8 feet high and 8 inches in diameter, we spent most of our days filling up 8,000 water bottles and when the festival started we had a lot of people trippin bawls come up and say things like ""oh gee, looks like a lite brite"" dur dur dur. Although, it kind of sucked because I stopped eating meat 2 weeks before bonnaroo, so i ate a lot of bread lettuce and tomato, doused in mustard for spice, but whatevers I survived. It was really cool because it was like watching a gigantic town being built around us, then we had a couple of vegetable powered buses full of dartmouth guys come by that were pretty rad and we went to a few shows with them. Also when the ambassadors came, a couple of guys from Maine chilled with me and chris a lot and they reminded me of flight of the conchords. When the shows started I got to see a ton of awesome shows including sigur ros when I was shrooming and almost cried in awe haha. Im so lame sometimes. My morning jacket put on a 4 hour set in the rain, and it was amazing!/freezing/totally worth everything. Also I saw ladytron which I have wanted to see since like junior year when me and caitlin would blast it in the car and drive around. I was kind of disappointed with broken social scene but it was still cool to see them. All in all after the long 2 weeks, me and my amigos were definitely ready to get our smelly asses home. Welp, more packin beckons, peace"

Outside is splendidly grey an drizzly, perfect weather for research and paper writing. I'm currently writing/procrastinating a paper on sustainable agriculture, and nerdily enough I'm really excited about it. This weekend has been really fun and laid back so far. Friday I went to work and ended up workin on the deck and makin mucho dinero, which is always nice, then played tennis with this guy greg i've been talkin too, ultimately we tied, which is nice since guys get all weird if you beat em, they're testosterone starts showin i suppose. Then we rented Army of darkness which is amazing, bruce campbell, what a stud. Yesterday, went to work, then went to eores(sp?) birthdy with my neighbors after we smoked copious amounts of hash out a really intense bong, needless to say i felt as though i were tripping the entire time and made the experience very enjoyable since majority of the people there were more than likely trippin bawls. Then I went to this beatles tribute band with my manager, which i thought may be a lil awkward but ended up being really fun. We smoked on the roof of hickory street then headed over and the band sounded EXACTLY like the beatles, looked like them, and acted like them, well i suppose i can't really vouche for that, but i can imagine. Guess its safe to say, if there were a coarse on beatles immitation, they would ace it with honors. Now im resting in my bed, was sent home from work since its all drizzly and im goin to spend the day catchin up on things i need to, which is refreshing. Tomorrow I'm studyin with my friend chris and im really excited about that.

I couldn't have asked for a better spring break, cause it pretty much came to me haha.<br /><strong>Monday/Tuesday</strong> <br />me, david, and his best friend and girlfriend slept outisde (in the rain) waterloo for the free my morning jacket and yo la tengo tickets WITH OPEN BAR. It wasn't too bad minus the rain cause the people from Independent film channel came and interviewed us, smoked us out, brought us free breakfast tacos at like 4 in the morning, and gave us free gum. Then the next day at the show they interviewed us again and we all look hungover and stoned check it out ---&gt;<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.ifc.com/video/Film/Festivals/SXSW/SXSW-2008/1457734336"">http://www.ifc.com/video/Film/Festivals/SXSW/SXSW-2008/1457734336</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />haha im so lame in it. Then we got inside and they had a fully stocked bar so i got a lot of crown and coke and thoroughly enjoyd the show as me and david had to lean on each other so we wouldnt be pummeled to the ground. THEEEEN after the show the IFC comes up to us again and gives all four of us free wristbands for being such ""good sports"" it was so badass, definitely made my week. <br /><strong>Wednsday <br /></strong>woke up exeedingly hungover and walked to work. Me and a few friends were going to go to this boat party but ended up being way too disorganized, so me and my friend katrina decdided to take the shrooms in my freezer and walk downtown instead. So we went to the jackalope and this local punk band was playing and the guy was goin insane. He ripped the light fixture out of the ceiling then started spinning around on the bar and started moshing in the small space WHILE i was shrooming, it was intense. <br />Then we left, smoked a bowl, and walked back and amber, josh, chris, and anthony all came up from san marcos and we walked back down to sit outside REM which was fun. Another good night :-) <br /><strong>Thursday</strong> <br />Woke up around 1 and me and chris went on a bike ride to daily juice where he met the cutest girl. So we were scheming on how to get her number for him and met up with his friend bryan. We were on our way to new order books when my bike flipped out and the axle bent when i went up this hill, so that kind of sucked a lot. lot of ""what should i dos"" happened and i just walked the bike home to where we smoked a lot then headed the del the funky homosapien and spoon free show. That was really badass and i saw my friend emily from work and candice from tx state who i havent seen in almost a year so that was fun. Me and chris drank a lot of jack daniels and proceeded to dance heavily at del then found amber, liza, and josh after the show. After that we were goin to this party at the childrens art museum which ended up bein a bust so we walked back n smoked and chilled the rest of the night. <br /><strong>Friday</strong> <br />Woke up and went to work again really hung over and made a lotta bills on the deck from all the sxsw tourists. Chris and Bryan then came in and got chips to keep me company for a bit. Then once i got out of work went home and drank a lot of coffee and chris and bryan came back up and they biked downtown while me a liza walked and we met up to see the cool kids but it was really crowded and they didnt have wristbands, so we decided to go find a place to smoke instead. So we went under this sketchass bridge with a bunch of punk rockers and smoked with them and realized we were sitting outside mxpx, so that was pretty badass even though im not a huge mxpx fan. Then after that we headed over to cedar door to see nada surf. Me and my friend juliane were able to sneak in and we got within one person away from the singer. It was so awesome when they played fruit fly and went all crazy too. After being in a haze of awesomeness, we went over to the lamar bridge where there was a crazy punk band playin and chris saw the girl from daily juice again which was adorable. But he wasnt very smooth about the situation and didnt get her number, stupid boy. Then we staggered home after a good night and smoked on the couch and passed out. <br /><strong>Saturday</strong> <br />woke up and walked to work to watch a beer cooler for 6 hours. Random, i know. I got a massive sunburn but it was a good thing i got super stoned before i went in so the time went by fast. Hickory street had some pretty good bands that day too. This one guy came in and he was the bassist for the johnny cash movie, and sounded just like him too so that was badass. Then i got off work walked home and my friend jeff and his band were playin down by the river at my apartment complex with some other bands randomly. So i went down there and the last band was really cool, they sounded a lot like the decemberists meet wolf parade, good combo. So i drank a few beers down there and saw kamisha who moved to utah a while ago so that was cool seein her and a lot of people i hadnt seen in a while. Then i decided to walk to NOFX's free show with emily which was so badass. The singer, sad i dont know his name) was trippin balls and was yellin at the audience to throw him x, and claimed the x being thrown was tums. Yeah it was hilarious. Made me sad erica wasnt there cause we used to listen to NOFX a lot. but nonethe less it was awesome. Then me and emily and her boyfriend walked to 6th street and went to the jackalope but i was ready to pass out so i walked on back. <br /><strong>Sunday</strong> <br />Went to work again and had to work a double in a really shitty section. But whatever, everyone at work was so hungover and exhausted that no one gave a shit about anything, it was nice haha. round 3ish i took a break and just passed out on the couch at the hideout for an hour haha, then went back to do inventory for a while. Then when i got out i hung out with julianne for a bit then went over to kyle's to hang out with david :) We took a lot of tequila shots and david and his good friend pat took some acid and proceeded to have a good time. And now its ST PATTYS day today!!!!!! the party never ends and my body is going to die but it'll be alright cause life's short :D Well, gotta go to class no more spring break! don't forget to wear green today"

I just realized this post is really pointless but im in a semi-nostalgic mood so whatever. I really wish i had a button where i could zoom ahead like 5 years and see where i was and who i knew, is that weird? I guess i just feel like im in a really akward place in my life right now because i dont want to get too close to anyone and i dont want to seperate myself either, meh whatever.

"event","So basically, i hope all you people in texas are having a great time with snow, because right now its 63 in mississippi and humid and i just saw a hillbilly running around at walmart with shorts on... so you suck. My mom thought it would be clever to bring a 12 hour murder mystery done by one woman imitating 20 different voices... lets just say my dad almost fell asleep behind a wheel and came close to killing a hobo. So we vetoed that vote. Hopefully it's going to get colder down here... they say they're asking for snow but the last time that happened was in 1964 and thats not an exaggeration. but meh. thats about it, i just hope ya'll are having fun.

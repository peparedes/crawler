"event","Nerd Rock Josh: i could start a real cobra terrorist group
Nerd Rock Josh: cause then i could buy guns
Nerd Rock Josh: and then well stop veganism
Nerd Rock Josh: and world hunger
michaelsharpguy: you'd have to start soon
Nerd Rock Josh: by feeding vegans to the starving
Nerd Rock Josh: cause you know 
Nerd Rock Josh: cows are vegans
Nerd Rock Josh: and theyre quite tasty
Nerd Rock Josh: so maybe vegans are quite tasty too
Nerd Rock Josh: and well start by terrorizing animal rights groups
Nerd Rock Josh: like the ALF and PETA
Nerd Rock Josh: like how they do research faciliites that are trying to find a cure for AIDS, deafness, and blindness....
Nerd Rock Josh: but since the ALF and PETA dont do anything that actually HELPS ... we eliminate them
Nerd Rock Josh: but before doing brute destruction 
Nerd Rock Josh: we give them warnings like
Nerd Rock Josh: cattle decapitation on their doorstep
Nerd Rock Josh: rude, but VERY funny pranks
michaelsharpguy: yeah
Nerd Rock Josh: we could say 'hey ingrid 'im a stupid cunt' newkirk.  end peta.  or we will end it for you.  eat a burger.  you stupid bitch <3  Cobra'
Nerd Rock Josh: it would be great
michaelsharpguy: that it would
Nerd Rock Josh: cant you just see a headline 'PETA GONE...  Wow...  Didn't see that one coming'
Nerd Rock Josh: the PeTA Reich ends ....
Nerd Rock Josh: i haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate animal rights activists soooooooooooooooooo much 
Nerd Rock Josh: theyre the most uneducated fucks ever
Nerd Rock Josh: 'but cows have feelings'  FUCK YOU
Nerd Rock Josh: thats DINNER
michaelsharpguy: well, some know what they're talking about when it comes to information
michaelsharpguy: but i don't believe in what they believe in
Nerd Rock Josh: no
Nerd Rock Josh: most of them dont know SHIT
Nerd Rock Josh: they just get their information from really lame ass books
Nerd Rock Josh: that have no scientific data nor reasearch
Nerd Rock Josh: just scare propaganda
Nerd Rock Josh: i mean come on!  wheres the fucking works cited page on PeTA's videos.
Nerd Rock Josh: and do people NOT see the license plates are in foreign countries in a lot of these videos?
Nerd Rock Josh: oh wait thats right cause in the OLD videos.  they were south of the equator...
Nerd Rock Josh: and tried blaming it on america 
Nerd Rock Josh: until someone that thinks like me pointed it out 'hey, thats not even in the US, dumbass'
Nerd Rock Josh: because we have LAWS preventing this sort of stuff
Nerd Rock Josh: and youre supposed to report it if you see it.
Nerd Rock Josh: and thats why we have REGULATIONS... 
Nerd Rock Josh: but now peta edits their footage a little better and avoids that sort of shit
Nerd Rock Josh: with license plates
Nerd Rock Josh: evidence that it could be from foreign countries
michaelsharpguy: yeah
Nerd Rock Josh: but instead of reporting mistreated animals in factory farms to the proper authority...
Nerd Rock Josh: THEY PROTEST THE MEAT COMING TO MARKET?!
Nerd Rock Josh: WHAT THEFUCK?!@
Nerd Rock Josh: and what made me SICk to my fucking stomach one day in austin
Nerd Rock Josh: was this big rally of angry vegans not allowing anyone into wendys on 6th street and congress
Nerd Rock Josh: they wouldnt let anyone in
Nerd Rock Josh: so the resturaunt lost money
Nerd Rock Josh: and heres the worst part
Nerd Rock Josh: the part that made me want to whip some asses
michaelsharpguy: ?
Nerd Rock Josh: a STARVING HOMELESS MAN had a buck 10... to get himself a jr bacon cheeseburger... and they wouldnt let him through
Nerd Rock Josh: because he was going to eat meat.
michaelsharpguy: i hate elitists
michaelsharpguy: i would come back with the biggest side of beef i could find
michaelsharpguy: and plow my way through swinging it
michaelsharpguy: and then i'd buy a classic triple, go sit on the curb, and set the side of beef in my lap
michaelsharpguy: and eat it off of that
Nerd Rock Josh: if you think youre SAVING the world by preventing people from eating... then you should DIE a HORRIBLE death
Nerd Rock Josh: the reason the earth sucks is that were what... 6 billion strong?
Nerd Rock Josh: and 2 billion are starving?
Nerd Rock Josh: you cant have a prosperous world with hunger and misery
michaelsharpguy: it's not all our fault
michaelsharpguy: i mean c'mon
michaelsharpguy: who the fuck would STAY in ethiopia?
michaelsharpguy: i mean if that's their holy land
michaelsharpguy: their god doesn't love them very much
Nerd Rock Josh: but with capitalism, equal oppertunity (not equal rights)  and agricultural science  (genetically engineered crops)   we can put a big fucking dent to the problem
Nerd Rock Josh: and thats why i think we need to just destroy all things dubbed 'holy lands'Nerd Rock Josh: and have someone claim theyre the anti christ
michaelsharpguy: well, we would be destroying american religious beliefs,and a lot of constructs on society are based on that
Nerd Rock Josh: and be a martyr so that these people will realise 'oh fuck our religion is stupid'
michaelsharpguy: in a land without god, you thinking starving is a problem would be considered idiocy
Nerd Rock Josh: but see, i have no proof there is a god.
Nerd Rock Josh: science has proven god(s) wrong on several accounts
michaelsharpguy: you can't prove or disprove god
michaelsharpguy: because there would be no beginning
michaelsharpguy: and humans think on a strictly lateral level
Nerd Rock Josh: who gives a shit about the begining.  we need to worry about NOW.
michaelsharpguy: there's a beginning and an end
Nerd Rock Josh: and not the future 
Nerd Rock Josh: just NOW
michaelsharpguy: it's not that simple
Nerd Rock Josh: yeah it is
Nerd Rock Josh: like what are we doing now
michaelsharpguy: people need to identify with who they are and that would be considering all and everything
Nerd Rock Josh: being sleep deprived and debating on the internet
michaelsharpguy: yes
michaelsharpguy: yes we are
Nerd Rock Josh: people just need to wake the fuck up and realize that religion is big business.
Nerd Rock Josh: john hagee's a fucking millionaire
Nerd Rock Josh: all because he preaches
Nerd Rock Josh: DAMNATION
Nerd Rock Josh: and scares people into thinking theyre bad people
michaelsharpguy: people are bad
Nerd Rock Josh: not all of em
michaelsharpguy: that's the problem
Nerd Rock Josh: people are bad if you tell them theyre bad
Nerd Rock Josh: sure
Nerd Rock Josh: theres some REALLY rotten apples out there
michaelsharpguy: see, i don't need a god to know not to lie,cheat,steal,or do anythign where substance is needed to alter my state of happiness
Nerd Rock Josh: but theres a lot of good in people
michaelsharpguy: but i'm not straight edge
michaelsharpguy: or chiristian
michaelsharpguy: or anything
michaelsharpguy: but at the same time
Nerd Rock Josh: see the simple rule of life is
michaelsharpguy: people need beliefs because...people are fucking dumbasses
Nerd Rock Josh: and this is HUMAN life...
michaelsharpguy: they need rewards,and if there's nothing to look forward to, what's the point of getting ahead and making yourself happy?
Nerd Rock Josh: the rule is 'do as you wish.  but do not impose harm on another person'
Nerd Rock Josh: well 
Nerd Rock Josh: i think everyone should get a brain enema
michaelsharpguy: imposing harm is evolution
michaelsharpguy: how would you get business if you couldn't get a better product than some guy next door?
michaelsharpguy: how could you ask out a girl without hurting some dude's feelings?
Nerd Rock Josh: but its in our instinct to survive
Nerd Rock Josh: physically harming
Nerd Rock Josh: mentally harming is just for the pussies
michaelsharpguy: ah
michaelsharpguy: okay
Nerd Rock Josh: like
Nerd Rock Josh: murder
Nerd Rock Josh: murder bad
Nerd Rock Josh: unless you have a GOOD reason 
Nerd Rock Josh: like 'yeah well that fucker killed my son, therefore i killed him'
Nerd Rock Josh: well did he do it for the hell of it ?  'yeah he did'  well then good job  thats justice.
michaelsharpguy: yeah
michaelsharpguy: well i agree on that standpoint, but then we would be in a state of anarchy
michaelsharpguy: and anarchy wouldn't work
michaelsharpguy: sorry, anarchy would NOT work
Nerd Rock Josh: lying is only justifiable if youre going to get in a girls pants
Nerd Rock Josh: anarchy is stupid
michaelsharpguy: i mean, we already try to have a society of no hurting,murder
michaelsharpguy: does it work?
michaelsharpguy: NO
michaelsharpguy: happy 9-11 by the way
Nerd Rock Josh: as long as theres no giving up freedom for security im happy
Nerd Rock Josh: that means socialism/communism is out of the question
michaelsharpguy: i'm happy as long as i can play in my band and eat and sometimes have money for jack in the box
michaelsharpguy: that's all my life is right now
Nerd Rock Josh: i feel that people should work and get paid to work
michaelsharpguy: good idea
Nerd Rock Josh: and thats capitalism
Nerd Rock Josh: and when you have exports
Nerd Rock Josh: and trade with other people
Nerd Rock Josh: the economies start to boom
Nerd Rock Josh: and become awesome
michaelsharpguy: i don't think there's such a thing as everyone being able to afford everything
michaelsharpguy: cause if that were the case
michaelsharpguy: we would have a downfall almost immediately
Nerd Rock Josh: well see we live in a society of gods and clods

for some reason i was wandering in this cloudy area...there were no trees, or even a pure colored backround..it was just an existence in itself. I was truly at one with nothing and everything had turned it's back on me. i found all of this solitude in such simple places. the only glow was that of my ebony pupils and my eyes turning red from tears that had already past...i figured out that no one's actually theirselves...they're all just caricatures of the laws they had learned by now. i found that i was one of the few open to this nothing i was walking around in. people don't let their eyes open as much as they should to see the way things are going to turn out. it gets so easy to be able to visualize these futures...and they hold themselves responsible for predictions made under lights i still can't see. 

I'm not being poetic, i'm being serious...

there's people who only know what they allow themselves to see..i don't know anyone who truly opens themselves up to anything..anyone with a variety of tastes in every single thing....all of the wonderful spoils of life are being wasted on those that can't see what it will bring them.temporary satisfaction is their game..and within that..everyone loses. people are starting to ""grow up"" around me and ""make mature realizations and decisions""...am i ahead of the game? am i keeping an illusion of righteousness? i think i'm just questioning the fact that no one is who they really are. no matter what, you care what people think..even if the person is yourself.what if you do just what you think is right for no one? what if you do what you know doesn't help or hurt anyone, and no one will even remember two years from now? no one will take the chance to think twice. it's so easy and i've already begun...i have this feeling that this ""nothing"" i was meandering in wasn't some tale of new beginnings..but a reflection of how i'm actually handling things around here...it's just so easy to strike down the minds of those who are normal...that all of you(Who are different) find it compelling to try to be original when the norm is so constantly left out. am i the only normal one left? in this clouded panoramic of color..(that kind of looks like the end of the neverending story 2 now that i think about it..you know where the ivory tower disintegrates and it's just him and that ugly ass princess?)as i was saying..in this clouded panoramic of color..it's the only place with visual sanctity and grace while it's also the only place where i can find myself alone.

it's solitude for my technicolor dreamcoat

i'm not sure what i mean...but i know that it doesn't matter

"event","so i'm sitting in my room with allison yesterday and my mother calls me telling me there's still a chance to graduate..

of course i'm in terrible disbelief
1.)too many absences(a huge amount) in certain classes
2.)my grades have been too low to average out to passing
3.)what?

she says that i can take credit by exam courses, and do extra credit for the teachers who's classes i'm failing. not only that, they'd ""help"" me. they said i could be all done by saturday and walk the stage.

now let me explain the dilemma.

in my opinion, graduation is a beautiful thing...and i would do most anything to get there. This small task of taking some more tests and doing some more work seems to be right up my alley since i'm desperate for graduation.

but

i've had just as much time to graduate as everyone else..and now they're all forced into final exams and what not while i would be ""fixing"" my grades and absences. not only that, i'm pretty sure they'd have to wipe a lot off of my record to get me to graduate. that isn't fair to everyone else. everyone else used their time wisely and they're gettin out the real way. sure, some of them cheated their way there..and life isn't fair, no....but even after all of this, i'll remember myself as ""The kid who got out of highschool by everyone cutting him breaks that no one else got""

the worst part about all of this is that i know other people would probably take this chance...but i don't see it as a chance. i see it as someone building a door to fit me in to a room for exclusive people...i feel like getting out this way would be dishonest.it just comes into play as the whole ""extra credit"" situation...and if you don't know..i think extra credit is bullshit for anyone who wasn't absent from class...but that's an entirely different subject.

i guess the reason i'm posting this is...i wonder if i'm being an idiot about it. should i do what would get me out quicker, or should i not do what i feel is completely unfair to all of my peers and predecessors?

stay healthy...

i love you guys..no matter what happens"

i would kill to walk the stage

i've been hearing about a lot of peopel complaining about graduation and how they're not looking froward to college and leaving. I know they're not me and i can't say that i share their exact situations..but i would fucking love to get out of this shithole i call a home and getting out of this shit educational system. you know, kids get points on personal quota with the teacher, and they get exempt from responsibility for being in sports and stupid shit like that...fuck that.i gave this year more effort than i have any other year of high school and it was probably one of the worst...all i've wanted to do since i've gotten here is get out and i can't even do that much because i have to attain a bunch of other shit i don't need and won't matter in two years anyway.i know people get the whole ""you don't appreciate what you have "" rap all the time so i'll make it brief...There's people who arent' graduating and tried their damndest to get there....

or

you complain about your food tasting bad when there's probably some kid dying of starvation in your neighborhood cause his mom's been missing for eight days cause her pimp killed her. so he doesn't know what to do except sit on the floor and cry with his stuffed duck in hand and wait for her while his stomach begins to eat itself.

and yes,if it helps to illustrate,his cheeks are sore from crying.

i bitch about a lot of petty shit that isn't necessary just like everyone else...but this feels like how one would feel if they hadn't had a girlfriend in 20 years, and their best friend is complaining about the 15th girl he had dated that year...you know?

i'm going on saturday to feel more left out than i ever have before..and to feel more like a failure than a thousand abusive lectures from my parents because i'm proud of the people who are good enough people to not be like me...and even the few that aren't graduating with me aren't reluctant about everyone else's involvement..so i'm just a bitter asshole about it....

i'll just sit there with a smile on my face seeing what i can never do, loving the person i am not, and loathing who i've come to be as of now..

It gets so easy to try and forget
People get to walk away from here
I have to crawl
Ah! Graduation!
Such a time to be lenient
I find that challenges are never too small
We've become God's tiniest beings
And the big side of a wishbone won't get us home anymore
A scratch from the needle that plays a trick on sound
And Herculean minds are brute,brawn, and forceful
Living incognito
Mandatory breaths
And nothing but hyperboles as contradicting descriptions
(Plus paradoxes of onomatopoeias as decisions)
My window of opportunity is tinted
Seeing idiocy rewarded with sympathy
and supreme intelligence revered as the likeness of God
Not one of the normal gets a break
the re-living of futures with 20/20 hindsight
A pathological sincerity is a scoff in your mind
The everlasting bastard casted upon contrasting caskets
With faster disasters and notice past her fasting
how could you? and why so?
infected with smiles brought upon by optimistic plagues
i still love it, could you believe it?
founding fathers upon a last indignance
i still love it, but it's laughing in my face
This is truly my last adventure
the eternal cocksucker proves his point
yet the whore is the one with wisdom in human behavior
i have yet to embrace the friend with arms so small
my friend that hangs with those standing tall
but we all know..you can only embrace so many

if you want to boycott gas..don't do some stupid ass one day boycott. 
1. if you're going to boycott, do it for weeks, even months
2.people who don't buy gas one day are just going to buy more the day before or the day after
3.if you really want to throw that shit out of swing..sell your gas guzzling car, work a couple of weeks/months...and get a hybrid car...they're cheaper...and they're one of the reasons gas prices are rising..(according to a poll i read in newsweek for gas prices since they've come out)
4. or if all else fails....go blow up all of the exxons or something...if you're going to get your point across, don't try to hurt the companies in theory...make it so NO ONE can get fucking gas.

"event","let's see...

i have my plan, tell me what you guys think of it.
i don't graduate..:(
i get a full time job this summer, and take some classes by exam
i finish up in excel next semester
get my car
get my night job
get enrolled in NW vista
get my basics over spring and next fall

that's my plan so far... what do ya think?

okay, so check this out...i went to catholic school, right? and there was this girl named alix. she was the only one who kept in touch with me after middle school ended....she's always been one of my best friends because of it.so yeah, about a year ago, i say that i'll go to prom with her because i figure...""hey whatever, maybe i'll get to know her more by then and it won't be so weird"" ...well that didn't happen and i called it off about a month and a half before her prom. so she goes on her lj and says that it's all my fault that she's going to have a terrible time. Her friends proceed to call me ""asshole"" and stuff in the comments because i guess i crushed her dreams of prom or something....but then later on she talks about what a fuckign great time she had at prom and then later has the gall to ridicule me to her friends because i'm in a band. she figures that i'll still be playing the shitty clubs in this town like..years down the road when she has some magical fiancee to beat me up for ""ruining"" her great prom night by not going and then her ending up having a wonderful time anyway. 

now then

i understand that alix is pissed off that i ditched her, but she ended the friendship upon this, you have to understand that. she left it on an away message saying how i led her on and how i've been a terrible friend. I'm not saying that she doesn't have the right to talk shit,but once again...people who don't know shit about me assume all of this bullshit about me just so they can talk about me and feel superior for a split nanosecond....i must say that i'm really tired of people who haven't taken the time to get to know me talking about me like they know me. unless it's fact, i don't want to hear about it. and if you're going to talk shit...do it to people who aren't going to tell me...(of course i'm going beyond the alix situation on this) shit talking is one of the lowest forms of communication. i don't talk shit unless the person already knows that i think that way, or if it's just known fact....well i guess everyone has their rights to open their cocksucking mouths to spit out whatever shit they just swallowed from whatever sewing circle they belong to.

i guess i just missed alix, and i didn't want to see that the first thing she said about me after that whole mess was just a bunch of shit talking about stuff that's important to me(like my band)

anyway...fuck that whole bullshit story and everyone involved in it..cause i had a good prom and i'm almost certain i wouldn't have had i gone with someone i've barely talked to for 4 years at a different school..adn from what i can tell..has changed quite a bit from the sweet and modest girl she used to be...

my prom owned.

we finished our new song today...

and it's either called 
""juan will never get his guitar back because it's only a memory""
""nathan gray""
or
""bear goes to hollywood""

it's not bad....i suggest you guys come see it on saturday at the city limits cantina....it's the ready to fail c.d. release..and i'm sure it's going to be good. it's $6 so yeah...start savin'!

<P>You know what bugs me about music lately? well..i consider myself a bit of a music connoisseur.I've known a lot of others in this field. I'm not saying i'm the authority, but i have a well rounded taste. It bugs me when people go out of their way to listen to different types of music solely so they can look like they know what they're talkinga bout when it comes to ""music loving"" music isn't about how much you know, it's about...actually, fuck that...it's about nothing. The best music has no message,no reason, and no predecessors.some people listen to music for political messages,religious messages,lyrics that they think can relate to whoever has broken up with them recently, a conjured feeling of worthlessness that they've recently acquired,or just some thing that sounds cool. You know what? I'm fine with that! but i'm tired of people going out of their way to look like dumbasses talking about music like they know what's what! I listen to music constantly and i still don't know shit about it. i will say that i can probably talk about it coherently for longer than a lot of ""music lovers"" out there i know, but that's only because i base my life around music, rather than letting it be a side factor. i can honestly say that music is the only thing where i can know what i'm talking about sometimes, and probably the only thing i'm any good at creating. and trust me when i say that i'm mediocre, at best. Man, and i'm not going to even get started on people killing certain bands and artists...that shit is just <U>wrong</U>...if you claim that you like so many different types of music, how come you're constantly listening to the same bullshit over and over?</P>

i was just watching tbs and they're showing the matrix on sunday,right?
and not until now have i heard such a cool tagline for that movie...

*ahem*

""when your world turns to nothing but binary code...which will you be?The zero, or THE ONE?""

i'm sorry...but that makes me want to watch the whole trilogy tonight.

way to go ted turner

"event","<P>so, i go to a show last night...not a hardcore show..but jsut a $2 tuesday thing at sin13. Keep in mind that this is the first show that i wasn't playing at that i had been to in a while. I get there, and it's fucking closed for the night and no one knows why. I went to see the Yequals..because they're probably the best non-hardcore band around these parts. I guess it was alright though, i got a copy of their sampler from the new c.d. they made, and i gave them our demo. They put ours in on accident when they were going to check if they gave me the right demo and they were like ""whoa! who the fuck is this!? That was fucking hard!""</P>
<P>it made me feel cool...B)</P>
<P>I got to go to krispy kreme(shipley's still kicks way more ass) and go play police 911 and some game where you have to be a quickdraw with cowboys. It's pretty damned fun. My legs are sore from moving around on police 911 though. (That's the shooter where you move with the game, it does a number on your thighs)</P>
<P>Yeah, so we have our show tommorow night..and i'm fairly excited. I think lance and i are almost finished with our parts of the new song, and devin will pick it up pretty fast. We added this part that sounds like dillinger/converge...which i must say, i usually wouldn't be fond of if it didn't...<STRONG><FONT size=5>KICK SO MUCH FUCKING ASS TO PLAY!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>I actually hate this whole metal/grind/thrash-""core""(and i use the word ""core"" loosely due to it's overuse in the music scene today) movement we have going on. I'll admit our band has breakdowns and stuff in it..but at the same time...we have a sort of american football-pre saves the day type melody to it. I don't know..maybe i'm boasting...but yeah, i'm glad i'm not in some dillinger wanna-be band. Or a band that sounds directly like anyone else.</P>
<P>the new song is called ""always fear a man that knows his jazz""</P>
<P>we'll probably play it at the cantina show coming up on the 22nd...which is a the ready to fail c.d. release..i suggest you all be there...the cantina has a stage now, so it's actually turning into a pretty nice venue. </P>
<P>That's May 22nd, which is,not this saturday,but next saturday. i hope you guys can make it out(if you see the need)</P>
<P>another thing i've wondered about lately is this whole high school affiliation with a quick lifestyle. I understand that kids like things FAST these days. I figure..life is like a road..and you never know where you're going to run out of gas and die....but if you go too fast, you can't enjoy the scenery on the way. What good is adrenaline if you can only see yourself during the rush? I guess i just hate drugs and partying and people that constantly have to be doing something.i mean, i like being occupied..but jesus...some people never sleep in their bed..</P>
<P>And i'm a man that loves his bed...</P>
<P>well i think that's all i have to say..</P>
<P>stay healthy everyone </P>

<P>i realized something today. Hunting is fucking gay. it shouldn't be a fat guy with a bunch of beer in a contained forest(where the animals can't leave) with tagged and marked animals.He shouldn't be wearing a complete camoflauge outfit, polarized glasses and be carrying mini-grenades and some automatic weapon he ordered direct from germany.</P>
<P>hunting should be some naked guy with a fucking sharp rock out in the middle of the god damned rainforest. otherwise...hunting is for fucked up pussies who like to think that their meats are bigger than they seem.</P>
<P>all in all...<BR>fuck hunting</P>
<P>i've been saying ""fuck"" a lot of things lately. i think it's because i'm starting to lose a lot of hope. i don't see much coming...do you?<BR>I mean honestly...what is there to look forward to? adult life?!?!</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=7>FUCK THAT</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>i can't wait until my show on thursday..i've gotten a lot more excited about it since practice. It's fun to be in this band..and i don't give a shit if we're not good enough to make it...it's fucking fun to do....plus i have somethign to put my time and effort into..i just put a bunch of pictures and shit up on our site..which are pretty funny :) </P>

"event","busy weekend of not doing a thing...i'm at eddie's, and i have been here for the duration of mother's day..

i had band practice
i got to see allison
i finished my keyboarding project
started my children's book

and now i'm starting to realize that the since is nothing but a dishonest trickery upon constantly said mentalities only lived in intellectual vanity. I take it to heart a lot more than one would think.

but what might one think when the answers are in front of him/her so much, that they lose meaning unless unanswered in retrospect?

"event","I'm at eric's house right now because eric is cool. we've been doing a children's book for i.p.c. about atom, the boron molecule...so far...we're about 13 pages in,and one thing about science has been mentioned. It's definetly an ""A""...

Eric: ""HEY!, THATS MY NAME UP THERE!""

we're listening to new radicals....hell yeah!
i wonder how some people's lives are going to turn out sometimes...are they just going to leave for some other city, come back...get married...get divorced...get a promotion,get cancer...get fired...get married again....become widow(er)ed..die...and live on in history as nothing?

i can't wait
plus, i have a feeling college isn't going to bring me any closer to wisdom, or intelligence for that matter.
wait this is the best part
""WE'LL KICK YOUR ASSES!""

anyway, i don't think that higher education is going to...educate me in any permanent matter. i honestly ahven't learned anything in high school except how to avoid work and barely get by in most cases.

what the fuck is it going to turn into?

stay healthy

p.s. taking back sunday still fucking sucks and i don't care who you are...emo started ten years ago, it should've ended when american football broke up"

i'm really tired of the deceitful

i wore purple today

i got the perry farrell c.d.(finally)
eric burned me jamiroquai
and i suggested cannonball adderly to eddie for jazz purposes

newspaper is kinda interesting...wish i had the smarts to be in it.

i've liked sonic youth since the 6th grade and murray street is still my favorite...and it was the first one i heard...i suggest that, if you're going to try and get into them, buy that one.

fuck taking back sunday
fuck that....fuck anyone who isn't more original than agent orange,sunny day real estate,american football,texas is the reason, or saves the day when it comes to ""emo"", or emo-core...and fuck any ""screamo"" band that calls themselves screamo when they never even equal up anywhere close to glassjaw.

This my friends, is where it's at...

show next thursday at the communion
$5.00
we go on at 9:30
we're opening up for hollowpoint

"event","An open editorial to all future and current ""Shadowbane"" players.

     I have been a Shadowbane subscriber for four months now. In 
the past four months I have been subjected to one of the worst 
MMORPG's available. The game mechanics, customer support, 
exploits, bugs, and lag issues all contribute to an 
unsatisfactory gaming experience. 

     Overall the lure of an MMORPG which boasts a massive PvP 
environment is irresistable to most seasoned gamers. The game 
allows players to participate in sieges, as well as random PK'ing 
and PvE style combat. These are the elements to which I was drawn 
to buying the game and subscribing to the service in the first 
place. What UBIsoft and Wolfpack,(the marketers, and development 
team,) do not tell you before you buy the game is that the game 
is prone to the worst lag imaginable in such situations. During 
sieges, the game lags so badly that very often you find your 
character dead or dying from PvP attack before you have the 
ability to respond in any way. Often I have engaged in PvP battle 
and have been completely unable to move as the game freezes, 
dropping my frame rate down to one frame per 10 minutes. Very 
often in such situations I find myself victim of sb.exe error 
where the game client completely seizes and crashes. This is not 
an unusual occurance. Any current player of Shadowbane will tell 
you that this is a common problem, that UBIsoft and Wolfpack will 
not address. In the past four months they have released numerous 
patches for the game in an effort to correct this problem, quite 
unsuccessfuly. I have found myself logging off the game when 
sieges or larger scale battles erupt as it is not worth the 
frustration of playing, knowing that the game will freeze and 
error. 

     Also, during sieges and battles, the cross-platforming of 
the game between PC and Mac systems creates massive packeting 
problems and results in numerous server-wide lagspikes that last 
anywhere from 2 minutes to an excess of several hours. The worst 
of the lagspikes I have endured lasted 3 hours without the game 
servers being rebooted, or any attempt from Wolfpack to resolve 
the problem. During such lagspikes, client side timers, like 
those that determine the length of ""Buff"" effects, still run 
while the server side events are completely arrested. During this 
time it is impossible to ""Re-Buff,"" thus leaving the player open 
to attack/increased damage when the lag passes. Several nights 
ago, I personally experienced 5 lagspikes that lasted 5 minutes 
apiece within a 30 minute period. Therefore, within a half an 
hour period I was only able to play the game properly for a total 
of 5 minutes. This perhaps is the most common problem I have had 
with gameplay in the past four months. 

      Also, when such lagspikes occur there is no warning that a 
spike has occured. A player who is moving will appear, 
client-side, to be in one location, when in fact the game server 
recognizes them to be somehwere else. When the lag passes a 
player will find themselves ""Rubberbanded"" a considerable 
distance back than where they percieved themselves to be. 
""Rubberbanding,"" is a frequent issue in Shadowbane, and the cause 
of much frustration. Often a player will attempt to run or evade 
a dangerous situation, only to find that they have rubberbanded 
back to the point of where they were in danger, and at that point 
taking damage or finding themselves dead. Rubberbanding seems to 
be most prevalent during periods of heavy lagspikes or when 
characters are moving in group formations. 

     Exploiting is another major issue within the game. To 
Wolfpack's credit several of the major exploits have been 
resolved over the last few months with patches. Since I began 
playing the game I have witnessed Theif-class characters use the 
""/stuck"" exploit by waiting invisible in a bank, robbing other 
players, and using /stuck to remove themselves from inside the 
bank before a player can respond. This was corrected by putting a 
timer on the /stuck function. Another major exploit was ""The 
Bursar Bug"" which allowed players to open trade windows with 
other players, place an item from their immediate inventory into 
the trade window, and removing the item from their inventory back 
into their open Bank box while the item still appears in their 
half of the trade window, thus falsifying a trade. This exploit 
was not remedied until the most recent game patch. 
    
      Another major exploit that has not been addressed as of yet 
is the ""Safe Zone Summons Exploit."" First off, when a player is 
""Summoned"" or teleported by another character they enter into a 
graphic ""Tunnel."" Shortly after a player is summoned, they appear 
in front of, (or rather inside of,) the summoner. The summoned 
character is completely vulnerable to attack as soon as they 
appear which is usually a good 30 seconds before they have 
finished porting through the tunnel. The summoned character is 
completely blind, unaware, and impotent to respond to attack. 
This in itself is not an exploit. The exploit itself comes into 
play as a Summoned character recieves a summon dialogue from the 
summoner, stating where they are attempted to be summoned from, 
(i.e. ""Summoner wants to summon you from the City of Khar 
Th'Sekt"") In Shadowbane, Khar Th'Sekt is a ""Safe Zone"" where 
players cannot be agressive or engage in battle. The summoner can 
then move outside the safe zone while the summon recipient is 
still in active transport, and before they appear. The summoned 
character is then no longer within the safe zone when they appear 
thus rendering the recipient succeptible to taking damage without 
them having the ability to do anything about it. This is a 
blatant misrepresentation of where the player is being summoned 
to and most players agree that this is considered an exploit. 
Shadowbane Customer Care considers this to be ""part of the game 
mechanics."" There are several other major exploits but for the 
sake of briefness I will not include them in this editorial.  

     Item and Currency duping is also a major problem within the 
game. Through various methods, unscrupulous players have found 
exploits which allow them to duplicate items and currency, thus 
destroying the in-game economy. Duplication negates the worth of 
rare items and allows training of expensive skills to be easily 
achieved, without doing any work to accquire the resources as the 
game requires. Furthermore, this unbalances other characters 
chances of survival within the game and disallows them any chance 
of being able to level their character or farm items in a fair 
manner. 

     Bugs within Shadowbane prevent certain game mechanics from 
operating properly. Examples of such bugs are ""The Safe Mode 
Bug,"" where your character logs on invisible, and in safe mode, 
meaning you do not appear to other players and are unable to be 
attacked until you move. The bug does not occur until you do move 
and your character remains transparent with a ""Safe Mode"" icon in 
your Effects window. The game continues to register you as being 
invisible and immune to attack, although your character is in 
fact completely visible and completely open to attack. There is 
no way to resolve this without relogging your character. For 
characters such as Thieves or Scouts that use ""Sneak"", 
(invisibility where your character is able to move freely.) This 
can be a major inconvenience as the ""Invisible"" icon is not 
replaced with a standard ""Sneak"" timer, making it impossible to 
determine the status of your invisibility. Very often players 
will find themselves stuck inside of wall and building graphics, 
unable to move or free themselves. 

     Patching from the server as a measure to fix certain game 
problems/bugs/exploits commonly end up creating more problems 
than they were intended to solve. Commonly Wolfpack claims that 
patching and server maintainance will not interrupt game play as 
the patches are uploaded to the servers during regular morning 
reboot cycles. Often they claim that when servers go down for 
maintainance or patches are uploaded that game play will be 
interrupted for only a few minutes at most. The reality of the 
situation is that on patch days or maintainance days, the servers 
go down for a better portion of over six hours. After the last 
patch the ""/who"" function of the game was rendered nearly 
useless. As of yet, the development team has made no effort to 
repair this critical function. Frequently with new patches, the 
game is prone to increased lag. One patch previous, it had seemed 
that the lag greatly decreased. Following the most recent server 
maintainance the server lag and rubberbanding issues escalated to 
nearly the worst that I have seen it in several months of play. 

     I should point out at this time that all of my characters 
are on one server only. I do not play on the other servers, but I 
often read the server notes on the Shadowbane forums provided by 
UBIsoft. Most of the other servers are prone to exactly the same 
problems in the same frequency. One server recently experienced a 
critical hardware failure that made gameplay impossible for all 
of the servers customers. 

     One other point that I would like to mention is that 
Shadowbane customer care is quick in responding to Customer Care 
petitions, but they are completely unwilling to help a player 
resolve their issues with the game. I recently contacted Customer 
Care over one of the aforementioned issues, as a victim of an 
in-game exploit. After explaining the situation in detail they 
take the position that this is, ""Part of the game mechanics."" 
Furthermore, after my initial contact with Customer Care, I was 
not offered an opportunity to reply to their response. When I 
sent my email reply I was sent an automatic message stating that 
If I was unsatisfied with their response, I could re-petition 
after four days. They only respond to in-game petitions and do 
not accept petition by email. 

     In conclusion, I will offer no suggestions to the Shadowbane 
Development Team on how to improve quality of gameplay. At this 
point I feel it is my duty as a consumer and a gamer to warn 
future, and current consumers on the shoddyness of this 
particular product. Shadowbane is a waste of time and money. On 
average the game works properly three of seven days of the week, 
if that. If I had been properly informed of the constant 
problems, bugs, and exploits that are involved with this product, 
I would not have bought the game and subscribed to their service 
in the first place. I do not reccomend this game for anyone, both 
new gamers and gaming veterans alike. Under no circumstances 
would I ever reccomend anyone to sign up for a year-long 
subscription to Shadowbane, let alone A month's subscription. 
I am cancelling my own subscription. I cannot in good conscience 
sell my account to anyone. Please take my honest warning to heart 
and save your money. 

Caveat Emptor."

My car is kind of fucked and I want to be able to get it repaired before I try to take it on any long drives. I've just been passing time by working on www.swgnexus.net and doing shoutcast web radio broadcasts. I usually do them later in the week from 12am to 4am. Industrial/Goth/80's etc at http://psyche.liquidskymusic.net:8000/ (just click listen if the server is up) Thanks to Shannon in Chicago for giving me the best ideas for music to download, and for keeping me current. Shannon turned me on to this fantastic track by Helium Vola ""Omnis Mundi Creatura."" I can't stop playing that over and over. Other than that, I've been recording more of my own music. I'm not thrilled that MP3.com caps non-member song lists at 3 songs, but what can you do? It's free. Other than that, there isn't much to report. I turned 30 on January 24. I deal with my room-mates dramas with his ex and my current friend. I haven't been back to Rochester since X-mas, and don't have any plans to visit anytime soon. I look back at living there and the friends that I've had, and aside from just a few people, there's no reason to visit."

Expensive, yet fabulous. I watched ""Donnie Darko"" this evening. It appealed to me the same way that ""Twelve Monkeys"" did. Lately I've become obsessed with absolutely clean living conditions. I want nicer furniture. I feel like my feung shui is off kelter. This is the most boring winter ever. I finished Kingdom Hearts and now I need something else to occupy the time in between. In between what I wonder. I cant go anywhere and I dont have much to do until the www.swgnexus.net site is up completely and the game released. I play the guitar for about an hour or 2 every day now and I am becoming accomplished. Well ttfn."

They have taken advantage of it by giving me the most inhumane hours possible. I will be hard pressed to ever trust a new employer again. Fuck you, Best Buy. Aside from playing a show at the Bug Jar two weeks ago that went rather well, not much has been happening. I try to fit in a few moments for myself in a day when Im not working or sleeping. Working at 4 am almost every morning is non conducive to any sort of social life. I haven't gone out hardly at all and I'm getting cabin fever. Hopefully I will be able to provide my folks with some decent Xmas presents this year. I am not buying anything for anybody else. I don't have the money.I may burn some CD's for my friends, but nobody should expect anything store bought. I am poor. Between bills and presents, this is going to be an overly expensive December. One upside to the month is that I got a new/used car. A nice Honda Accord. Reliable, with a heater you could fry eggs on. Other than that, I haven't seen too many people lately. It was nice to get home to Rochester and spend time with my people there. Too bad my old car died, literally, as I drove into town so I couldn't drive everywhere I wanted to go. I did get to share a beer or two with my friend Jeremy which was really nice. Got to spend time with the family too. I got to see my old ""friend"" Fawn and was quickly reminded why I stopped talking with her in the first place. Shannon never comes online anymore. I don't know if I should keep looking for her or not. I wish people would just tell me whats up so I don't keep waiting for them. I spend way too much of my life waiting for people. In any case, thats about it for the moment. Until theres something worth reporting, I'm out."

I don't know when I can even sleep anymore and the last week has been a serious blur. At least things are finally settled with the apartment. We're all moved in and everything looks great. The next door neighbor is my age and cool, the downstairs neighbor is deaf. Everything works out. I can feel myself turning bitter again...The smile reserves are all empty. I'm running out of compassion for people again and concentrating mainly on myself. I've decided to quit smoking again soon and get myself in shape by the summer. There are so many things about my life I need to change right now. I feel like stepping on people. The world makes me angry. Time to change everything again. We had cable here for about a week after we moved in, and it only reminded me how disgusting the world can be. How horrid the world has become. How many things need to be changed. Perhaps it's just the sleep deprivation talking. I really haven't slept more than 20 hours this week. I can't seem to get a hold of anyone I need/want to talk to. Enough ranting...Rented GTA Vice City...time to go kill video sprites."

It's just hard to not smile when you have one of these songs pumping. Perhaps I should start writing the stuff. My computer is fated to never be USB compatible. I tried getting a webcam hooked up, but no luck. It's a rainy night in Buffalo, and that is depressing. The one thing I can say about the weather here is that mother nature never does anything half ass. If it's raining, it's pouring...if it's snowing, well, I don't even want to think about that right now. But either way, the weather has dictated my mood for sure today. It is just dark and wet and my bones are aching for no good reason. I'm still waiting with baited breath to see if I get my job for sure, because I am so damn tired of sitting here day after day doing nothing. I moved to Buffalo to get away from all the insanity and bullshit of Rochester, instead, the insanity is replaced by nothing. Absolutely nothing. Buffalo is no social Mecca. There's just nothing going on tonight and the sidewalks have been rolled up already. ""It's a Raymond Chandler evening and the pavements are all wet...and I'm lurking in the shadows 'cause it hasn't happened yet..."" I remember reading that at a poetry house in Milwaukee years ago, and thoroughly embarassed myself when someone recognized it. Thank god that the perpetual guilt of embarassment has subsided. I feel self-loathing now as a dull throb rather than a screaming catastrophe. I don't know if it's the change in scenery or lifestyle, or just getting older, but there's no sense in wasting my energy hating myself anymore. My life seems calmer now, slower. I regret less. If anything I regret wasting so much time with guilt, fear, loathing, and self-hatred. Like I've said before, I find beauty and peace in the world when I pay less attention to what mankind has set before me, and I start finding beauty in the rest of the world. The world of man is a noisy, unbalanced, and chaotic place. There's only so much sensory overload the mind can take in the course of one day. My zen is the world. I dream in blue."

What do I have to say? Who hears my voice? Today I was thinking about the golden days of industrial music, where having a synthesizer made a musician unique and artistic. In the glory days, they would meet by sending each other mail-art, they would send each other animal parts and get themselves exiled from whole countries. They would join together and write incredible earth shaking, life changing, paradigm shifting music. What happened to that spirit? Where are the true artists today. Why do the people involved in ""The New Millenium Avant-Garde"" resolve themselves to such egotism and snobbery.Every great mind needs a great mind to co-operate with. Cevin had his Kevin, Bill had his Rhys, Genesis had his Monte and Cosey, and yes, even Trent cant go it alone. He needs his Dave Ogilvies and his Floods and Brian Eno. Where are the artists that I am going to change the face of music with? Surely not in Buffalo NY. Am I in the wrong place or just the wrong time? I want my mail-art. I want my animal-parts. I have to make a change and do something that matters.  What can happen at 3:53 am?"

It will be really nice to get back to work. Life goes on as usual in Buffalo. Yesterday was Eric's happy 20th birthday, and I have my 30th birthday coming up in just over 3 months. I was thinking the other day about how far I've come along in the past 10 years. I can at least see that I've matured in many ways. I dont let the crushing weight of insignificant people or emotions get me down anymore. I know what I want from life, but I am afraid that it's too late to chase some of my goals. In many ways I feel the need to shake off the trappings of youth, but keep myself young at the same time. It has been 10 years now since Heidi. She is in my mind at least 30 seconds of every day. It has almost been 10 years of being alone since her. I wonder sometimes how I keep myself well adjusted after being alone for so long, but I have many distractions. It gets easier to forget as the years roll by. At least I can say that I've become an accomplished musician in these past 10 years. That's a major goal that I've conquered. Now, only to make something of myself as a musician. My favorite artists all hit their success in their 30's and that's just around the corner for me. Recording, Tours, Money. Time to hop on the bandwagon for anyone else who wants to ride along. To my anonymous friend, yes, it's you."

I finally got a decent job offer and after the impending drug test that I should pass no problem I will have money again. My cold is all gone, but now the weather has changed. Everyone I know is getting sick or has been ill. It reminds me of a line from the book, ""The Exorcist,"" '...Like a magic carpet for germs.' Halloween is rapidly approaching, one of the most dread nights out of the year. I never seem to have fun on Halloween, and it has nothing to do with the fact that I dont get dressed up. This year might prove differently. Always, when the weather gets cooler, I get more sentimental. I have been thinking a lot about the one woman I know that I trust. I don't even know her really, but I have never encountered a person so well grounded and concerned about who I am. She has her own problems, but seems to take them in stride.

"event","I am deep within phase 3 of a cold. Phase 1. Slightly uncomfortable, but still relatively healthy. Phase 2. Diminishing health, symptoms begin, sinuses become irritated, swollen and begin mucous production. Throat becomes inflamed. symptoms can be mild or severe. Phase 3. Just plain fucking sick, and nowhere near feeling healthy, accompanied by an acute over-production of mucous. Illness is felt throughout body as a malaise. Sleeplesness. Apathy. Phase 4. Mucous membranes stop production, sinuses begin to clear, malaise leaves, breathing and pain faculties approach standard comfort levels. I'm sure everyone is familiar with this. I feel like total crap. I haven't rested well in days. I don't cope with being sick very well. The weather is so warm and humid, that I feel even worse. At least in the wintertime the cold air is soothing to a cold. In summertime a cold feels like you're trapped under the heaviest, nastiest, wettest pile of blankets imaginable. Everything feels like I'm doing it with 20 lb. weights on my extremities. My eyes are sore. Have I mentioned I don't cope with illness well? This reminds me of one of the best lines from the animated version of, ""Return of the King.""

The clothes need washing, the trash needs taken out, and the floor needs a desperate vaccuuming. I want to get this taken care of, but the neighbors will not enjoy a Dirt-Devil being run at 5:30 am. The car seems to be ill as well.
      I think that about covers everything tonight. My stats are slipping, so if you're reading this, stop, and go listen to the new tracks that are up. http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/360/jenova_union.html"

"event","What a wet nasty day to get in the car and road trip. The engine got so wet that the car had trouble starting. It seems as if everytime I drive to Rochester, God sets the forces of nature in direct opposition to my plans. Torrential snowstorms. Driving rains. Howling winds. In the end the drive was worth it. I got cookies. It was also worth it to visit family and friends. Little sister needs to plan her moving arrangements better though. Hyasynth had her song delivered and liked it so it is going up on MP3.com. Dreaming was colorful again last night albeit grim and frustrating. Women showing up in my dreams that are unwelcome. I have started talking recently to two people that are in pain from relationships or depression and I wish that I could help them. I think that I've swung out on the other side of the blackest depression I've ever been in and I see that life is pretty decent. I dont let the little bullshit get me down anymore. I look forward to more life and find it precious. I have no more time for bullshit. Value what you have when you have it. Mourn it's loss when its gone, but do not dwell on what you cannot change. Don't get so lost in a dream that you forget to live. http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/360/jenova_union.html"

"event","#89 on the all regions charts! #41 ON NORTH AMERICA CHARTS!!!! Needless to say I'm rather pleased. Tomorrow, I get to go to Rochester to help my sister move, and to visit some friends. It's going to be interesting to see what things are like between my friends there and I now that my habits have changed. I slept way too late again today thanks to a pointless unemployment appointment. I waited over a half-hour for a 5 minute meeting. In any case, my dreams have gotten stranger and stranger. The events are much more vivid, I remember more of them, and I can finally dream in color again. When I wake up it takes me a second or two to discern dream state from reality. For once in a great while I feel well rested when I wake up and more focused during consciousness. My subconsious has proved to be very intriguing. Hopefully I can attempt lucid dreaming soon. http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/360/jenova_union.html"

You must go read this. This is a poem written by my friend Euth from #gothic. She has a definite talent for writing! I'm not easily impressed by poetry and I think her writing is wonderful. Right now, I'm so damn tired I could fall asleep at my keyboard. I finished my new track entitled ""Hyasynth Blue"" for another online friend. This one's going up on the MP3.com page for sure. I hope she likes it. I had two rather interesting nightmares in my brief period of sleep last night. One involved having to work my way through a long series of green tunnels being preyed upon by a large spider. Thats the last time I read the chapter, ""Shelob's Lair,"" in Lord of the Rings before bed. While I'm napping go check out http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/360/jenova_union.html"

"event","I'm really not happy with Dalnet atm. It's kept me occupied and sane this summer, WHEN IT'S NOT CRASHING EVERY THREE MINUTES. I'm currently wide awake at 4 am waiting for the fresh stats to post. I heard the most glorious 15th century vocal music in the car tonight. I highly reccomend listening to classical music in the car. It makes you less agressive and more intelligent if possible. I want to get up to the college and ask Doc Walker if he can reccomend any good recordings. I wonder if you can find music like that on Kazaa? I miss the days of FLCC. I'm fairly eager to see the old professors and show them that their time teaching didn't go to waste. I wish I could go back to school right now. I need new reading material. The problem is when you read masterpieces the imitations hold no lustre. Going to burn new songs to disc to upload on the site tomorrow.http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/360/jenova_union.html"

"event","I ate so many damn mini egg rolls I think I'm going to be sick. I'm over at my friend erics tonight. Decided to take a short break form working on music tonight. As a forewarning, if you ever have to go on unemployment they get downright naggy about coming in for bi-weekly eligibility reviews, usually at some ungodly hour of the morning. I should be able to hook up with a job sometime in the next week or so. Got an application in at Best Buy.
Other than that I've been getting tons of responses from friends about my MP3 mailings, and I got my 1st piece of fan email! Thanks to Hilary up in Canada for that! Got letters today from old friends Erick Scheid and Gregory Paul out in Rochester. I'll put links up for those guys later tonight. Greg and good friend Dan Dangler ( www.houseofhellfira.com ) were kind enough to put me up on their MP3 radio stations. Much thanks for the promo guys!

"event","Just put the finishing touches on ""Hyasynth Blue.""  This is a much more industrial track than I have written in awhile. Used a bunch of samples I got from www.analogindustries.com 
Most likely I'll put the track up on MP3.com when it is completely tweaked to my satisfaction. Otherwise, it came out sounding pretty good! It always seems like I can come up with more interesting ideas for songs when I am writing them for someone other than myself. As always, I smoke too many cigarettes when I am creating. I am bored out of my mind waiting for my friends to get out of work. Damn. I just spent all this time making a .wav and MP3 of this track and I can already hear levels that need to be corrected. Being a perfectionist can be a pain in the ass. I can hear my book begging to be read but I haven't the heart to pick it up at the moment. I cant find my damn rings either. As always, dalnet is being a pain in the ass."

"event","YARGH. My numbers are slipping. GO LISTEN TO THE TRACK! http://www.mp3.com/Jenova_Union
Other than that, I woke up late today after dreaming about being back in High School. Dreamt about a friend named Brian Corrigan that I went to youth group with back in the day who I remember was an aspiring musician as well. I need to quit smoking. I'm dreading having to move all this music stuff (plus all my other belongings.) I have no idea what I'm going to do today. I should try and see if I can get a hold of my friend James in Chicago that I havent talked to in 2 years. Finally found him thanks to my friend Hyasynth from #gothic. Shes a fantastic girl =)http://www.hyasynth.feminaexmachina.com/exposure.html The track I'm creating for her is almost done."

"event","WHEW! I finally got this thing up and running. It's late, I'm still awake, and I'm utterly exhausted. I am completely addicted to checking my stats at MP3.com, (my latest obsession,) and I still have about 350 pages to go in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" (yeah, I'm also addicted to the books but they're an easy read, and quite humorous.)
It's finally cool enough outside to sport my hoodie and hopefully it will stay just like this until the end of November. I booked a show at the Bug Jar in Rochester NY on November 21 and it looks like I'm going to be competing with other electronic musicians that night.
If anyones interested in my music they can check out the link in the subject for this entry. I have about 5 cigarettes left and I'll probably have to go to the gas station before 6 am to get a refill. I have a fever and the only cure is more cowbell! Thanks to Eric for helping me get set up with all of this."

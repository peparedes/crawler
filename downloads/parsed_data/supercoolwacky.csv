Outside.

Well, clearly he's inside or he couldn't be posting this. Busted.


So earlier i was diving for shells with my Nautical Nuns when I realised i'm moving away in two days. Clearly The Bourne is not very far away but it feels like it is. I hope the people whom i am sharing with (who seem nice) don't turn out to have obsessive compulsive disorders or care about farting and cleanliness too much. Urrh, error. It would be like living with The Vordemon, or The Carlton. Although if i lived with The Carlton she'd be able to take me places on her moving piano and i wouldn't have to pay the extortianate rates for driving lessons and court fees. Or death duties. Isn't that the most annoying thing you've ever heard? The goverment screw you all your life by taking your hard-earned money and calling it Tax (not Super Tax, this isn't Monopoly. Or is it? Is it? We've never had a party in a mental home before, although I'm sure it would be just too divine. I hope I get to be the top hat, not that wierd shoe - what was that always chattin' about? Why a wierd shoe? Not even a posh shoe. Actually, when it comes down to it, why a tiny doy, I mean tiny species of dog, obviously it would have to be tiny or it wouldn't fit on the board - except if it actually was one of the breed of those tiny dogs, but it would be quite hard playing around it while it just sat in the centre like i giant Persian Raspberry Swirl) and then you die you have to pay for it! Bastards. And they call this country a democracy.

Say Country really slowly, accentuating the two syllables. Go on. Count-ry. Rude isn't it.

Where's Henry?

Still...

...Inside.


'What! I'm not your senorita, I'm not even part of your tribe!' remarked Lorton as I realised that after about seven years of seeing her almost every day she was going off into the big wide Lortondom (like Kingdoms for Lortons), or Bath to nanny the rich and famous. Maybe she'll look after Madonna's bizarro kids and join Kabbala.

DON'T DO IT FAIR LORTON, THE WAY TO THE STARS IN ON THE GREAT PAVEMENT IN THE SKY, WITH MYSTERIES TOO DEEP FOR A SWEET LORTON LIKE YOURSELF TO DISCOVER. (Even if she climbs as fast as Viginia Creeper, which is swamping my house, or rather, mon parents house at le momento. Bastard.)


In related news, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BECCA! I know it isn't yet, but i wanted to get it in quick before the dwarves strangled you in your sleep. HAPPY DEATH DAY! Do you remember that? I would have felt so guilty if you had actually died.

Instead...

...YOU'RE BLIND!

Did you know that love is a verb here in my room. Actually, that's a bit of a stolen lie, and I think we all know from whom it has been poached, even if you stole my dreams away we shall fly high on the wings of the dove. Poor Milli. Bad Helena Bonham Carter, stop that or I'll put you down the toilet and flush!

For the delicate heart of a lady. I'll withdraw you fool, you and your limp cravate, I ask you! And the sorry cut of your sleeve, sink me I can scarse bring myself to look upon 'em.

My heart is heavy for leaving you my fellow friends, though what care i for human hearts, soft and spiritless as porridge, a Nautical Nuns' heart beats fierce and free! Yet still, you can come and stay with I if you answer me these questions three:

1.  Where does the name Supercoolwacky origionally derive from?

2.  The party may have been lovely Mother, but what was it really?

3.  And if the universe is constantly expanding, what is it expanding into?


That last one has been driving me mad. Is it just beyond human understanding that somewhere there can actually be nothing or have no end, like in the Nightmare Castle books? Just because everything we know has a beginning and and end? Sorry Kat, this was not designed to piss you off, I just really wanted to know and wondered if anyone out there in cyber space knew anything about actual space. Plus, did anyone watch Dungeons and Dragons the other night? It wasn't as good as the TV series. I used to love that more than pestilance.

Post your answers on my live journal, but make great haste as I will be duely leaving for The Bourne on Saturday this week, this specifically applies to you, those who are undesearving of the other sex. Yes, thankyou Kitty. Oh fab, I love cats, not my cat though, he's a right old wanker, actually most cats annoy me a little. They're really stupid but look at you like Coral - like they eat bars of gold and bathe in pearls - you're not better or sexier than me, Cat, you're not the Bassist's immortal soul (or The Vordemon, mmm, her face gets Ry going - Makosi does not like this).

I see.

Well?

I said I see.

Do you ever wish you lived in the Twenties, where I could drive to the beach and not be restrained by stupid buses that don't go on bank holidays. Stupid gays. No matter, we can all promonade the beech when i am retired at The Bourne. Hurrah, what a splendid idea, and i shall wave you all off - Send our love to Father!

Well my sparrows, i will get out with my nonsence now and go hopping along the road with a steamroller-daughter, or get back to diving for shells, i've built up quite a collection, if only those stupid nuns would stop stealing them and spending them at that casino in the mountains. The one without any eyebrows said you don't get respect from wearing other people's wive's furcoats and she's going to start up a singing school and wait for Mr. Postman. Bitch, swaying me with her persuasive emotive arguments. How can I possibly refuse, just think of the children, they need those shells more than me, yet I still need them to get to Texas and put on my blue, blue dress.

Has anyone seen my Spark, it's not here, here...


...here.

This may be my last entry ever, so cradle it like a Van Gough pig, and care for it more than a light in the dark, as I am Sister to the Fates.

Goodbye, goodbye everybody. I must go, those nuns are getting frisky and I never wave at the 9:15 any more. Here's a final thought: whay are bands so ugly?"

"event","Right, so i just had to wash my hands in oil from the floor of my garage. Now my oudour some what resembles that of a leaking automobile - I'm just too devine! I mean, i'm lovely. The reason behind this being that I'm doing this huge painting for my village fete on Saturday, you know, the ones with fat people on in tiny beach clothes so that they splurge amusingly and have their faces cut out for people to put their own equally amusing faces into for photos. I didn't realise that the paint i was using was oil-based and thus became covered in it. It was only when it began to dry that i realised there was a problem and i couldn't get it off. Also my flesh was being uncomfortably glued to off bits of flesh so i had to spread all my fingers out as i rubbed myself in floor-oil. Edward said i couldn't use the white spirit because there was hardly any left. Bastard. I wouldn't mind except the picture i'm doing on a huge board is one of those bits of 'art' that's meant to be comical and cartoon-like, whimsical if you will. It bores me to do it and it's not even like the end result will be beautiful to look at or be proud of, not like if i was doing something Art-Nouveau inspired or copying a Carravaggio. Grr, arg. I think I'm getting paid for it, and it better be a lot. I'm trying really hard not to rant about the Tate Modern right now as that is what this aboration to art is reminding me of. Error...

Might sit a car later and flick the window up and down, it was so much fun in the limo.

Urh, that reminds me of yesterday when i had my first driving test. I thought the first one was supposed to be fun - I hated every single second of the two hours. My instructor Lynette is really nice and gives me sweets but that didn't distract me from the fact that I was incharge of a DEATH MACHINE that was more terrifying than The Vordemon. Can't wait til next week's lesson! - I'd rather gouge out my eyes with rusty forks, atleast I would feel less tense doing that! Actually, maybe not.

Thursday I have to meet this guy called Rupert who I might be living with for a year with two girls called Amber and Becky. It was nice of him to call me from Thailand the other day because there it was one in the morning and we spoke for about half an hour and he seemed really nice. Actually it was Mcow he was calling from, if that's how you spell it, because he's been in Malaysia visiting his girlfriend, but soon he'll return and marry Becca.

That's that, ciou."

Things that remind me of Kat:

- Toxic by Britney Spears
- My Neck, My Back, by Khia, it kind of makes me want to lick her 'UH!' juuuust like that.
- Miniature things, most notably tiney musical instruments or animals, preferably dogs or puppies - GO ASTRO!!!
- Ton of Lorts (as in Settlement of Lorton)
- Volvas
- Women being viewed as mindless sex objects not as equals to men - see Klimt's 'The Kiss.'
- Rolos
- Vogue
- Yelling or anger (with good reason!)
- And for some reason sexual advice, though i cannot think why - can you Kat?

There's probebly more, but i'm getting a beating as it is. I love you Kat, you're v. super cool wacky. (no Gwen, it hurts!)

"event","She's as fine as dandelions blowing in the wind
She's not thinking she's listening


These are more personal than i've been with anyone, you just cannot dance my rhythm in time:

Cats that trip through yonder sphere,
She has nothing left to fear,
The sky grew dark,
The sphere rose high,
And glinting this,
In spinning trips,
Proceeded by the singing lark,
Finally they wave goodbye.

He sings the blues,
We enter truth,
In this we see,
Our own true harmony,
And though we circle down to ground,
Your melody is bringing me down.

The cold she feels is warmed by day,
With friends which sit not far away,
The twisting, turning into rhyme,
We find it's now too late (to shine),
Enjoy in each, each shard of time,
By motorway she dines on chocolate cake (and wine).

The wind blew warm and fragmented from the South,
Stirring in our fragile coil,
These two days have been no toil,
Elaborated liquor denied my mouth,
These seven days were raised up high,
With friends that laugh in days gone by.

          *      *      *

Maybe you were all faster than me,
We give each other up so easily,
And silly little wounds will never mend,
I feel so far from where I've been.

          *      *      *

Jack Johnson on the radio,
Spinning, singing, to and fro,
And as her life would end,
Events become unplanned.

The notes trickle forwards down to me,
Until together we link to make our perfect harmony,
Close as close and close together,
I hope she will sit and stay forever.

As doves escape the noisy lofts,
Our tender touch is sweet and soft,
But who's to say,
Not half a week before the storm,
We help together each day,
For in each moment a shining star is born.

          *      *      *

The swirling spirals now complete,
I feel it needs more stars of red,
And as the sun shines through the heat,
The leaden beads quell all doubts within my head.

          *      *      *

As hard as dreams that I may wish to cast,
These precious illusions may never come to pass,
How much I want,
How much I need,
As our worlds collide we seem like twins,
Yet c'est la vie here in my lonely without him.

Say you, say me, say always and forever more,
I'd be your perfect little Sugar Bride,
In secret I would be your Whore,
If our hearts would naught divide.

          *      *      *

             SHE FLOATS

Like Beast of Hair,
In truth or dare,
Be thick or fair,
The notes we hear,
They drift to me on walls of ice,
Some words kept quiet as the mice,
Though always not as sweet as pie,
Drifting between low and high,
Sweet Dreams we wish they can come true,
As clear and priceless as mornings dew.

Though what are we to trust, our faith?
In what,
we flit from place to place,
She sings a song we hardly hear,
It drifts through corn cut twice last year,
The Wheel spins faster,
I feel a chill,
The colours merge and lose their luster,
Is all that's left grey?
Is each day grey?
Where have all the colours gone?
They soon return when having fun.
I will not fray to grey,
This emptiness we seek to fill.

And as the morn fade into day,
I mingle outwards with the Fae,
If you cannot find it,
It is you that is lost,
To friends we give it costs no costs,
The Crimson Heart she brings,
For she's not thinking she's listening.

          *      *      *

Those within your heart can never fade"

Isn't it wierd how you never think that it's just a burgular sleeling your tv, it's always a murderer who knows exactly where you are and are only after YOU! I was so sure that someone was walking up the stairs and breathing outside my door that i pushed my fucking massive heavy dresser in front of the door and falling asleep with a huge protective log within reach. This morning i was so happy to wake up and still be alive, i really valused what i hava. I know its stupid and has ehoes of 'Friends' when that car backfired and Ross thought it was a gun, but it was really like that, i had convinced myself i was going to die and i was alive -HURRAH! Also Swallows and Amazons was on yesterday, I love that movie it's so sweet and fun.

Your Melody is Bringing me Down

A couple of old Burgate people coming over tonight which i hope will be fun, Ton of Lorts (as in Settlement of Lortone) is staying with me all week until we go to Larmer Tree, and she's got her own room and everything, we just went food shopping and spent fourty quid on what was predominatly pizza and alcohol - heart attacks here we come!

Anyway, I think I'll go and lie in a field now, or finish the mural on bedroom wall, which is looking really good now, bye."

"event","Me and Niv watched the news all afternoon today until they began to show all the same stuff again, but isn't it awful? Does anyone understand the fucked-up thought processes behind bombers or suicide wankers? Apparently the play 'Talking with Terrorists' gives you the perspective of how hurting innocent people becomes verified as alright to do in the mind of some people, through surcumstance, and Hitler's best friend indoctrination. Urh, it's terrible, I can't stop thinking about it, which cuts my mind into two apposing halves as Lorts, and Ed and I are going to Larmer Tree next week and there's so many things to do there - I'm sooo excited. There's african danse classes and yoga, and clay sculpture - ooaarhh, it's going to be super cool wacky (appropriate, eh?).

So, do you ever wonder how much you should let other people's lives influence your own and vice-versa? For example, children are dying in Africa every second acording to the Make Poverty History campaign and I'm sat here worrying if my hair is alright (Make no comments). I couldn't help but wonder, are we in our rich Western countries too selfish and self-obsessed so that it is detrimental to the lives of others we haven't even met? I mean, we are born with so many choices just by default, we could do almost anything if we worked hard enough for it, but people in parts of Africa don't have that choice, they only have only one path in life and it is trying to stay alive and keep their children alive. And that gets me to wondering how much I should think about it and how much i should actually do. Because there's no point worrying about it if you don't actually do anything to help. I mean, I have a right to a life to don't I? But then so do they. What should I do? If we didn't have TV, radio or newspapers we wouldn't even know that they exist, so, urh. I just feel so guilty having fun when i know people all around the world are dying and i could be helping to prevent it. But then, they are not in MY life, but does that make any difference? How far does selfishness blend into everyone's general human needs? Because I don't think i can watch another report about dying African children, it's just so heart-breaking. And everything else by comparison seems so empty and petty.

URH! I hate feeling like this. How does everyone else manage? Is everyone just completely void of empathy or do they quietly get along and help without making a big song and danse about it? I sent an e-mail to Tony Blair from the Make Poverty History website, but what's that really going to do? Also, the white bands are made in sweat shops! - oh my god, is the entire world corrupt?! Does anyone else feel betrayed and let down by that? Plus, isn't Bob Geldoff REALLY annoying?!

So glad I got that out.

Don't you hate it when you become a little bit obsessed with a song by someone who is clearly a twat? Charlotte Church is my most recent example. She moved out of her million pound flat in London just because she couldn't be arsed to clean it - clearly a dick, but I really love that song of hers. While I'm rambling on about this subject, Good Charlotte also fit into this category. Piss me off fuckless, but then they do those irritatingly catchy songs that you secretly really like, but you just can't admit it to yourself, even when you clandestinely sneek into Woolworths to buy the single. It's clearly the Charlottes of the world that should be watched, maybe slightly injured. OH! and worse, when it gets to the stage when you have to lie to people about what you're listening to on the bus or in an art lesson. Once Roz chased me round the whole sixth form because i didn't want to let her find out that I was listening to Ashlee Simpson - I know she's completely feckless and talentless and almost unfathomably irritating but the album's really good alright.

Shit, this is becoming a confessional, I'm going to go and finish the mural on my bedroom wall before I write something baaaaaad.

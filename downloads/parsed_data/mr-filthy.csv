"event","okay, first of all, cradle of filth is awesome, and dani filth is so darn sexy! lol, j/k. they are juat so... well, lets put it this way, they are what i like to call emo-metal, if you will. i mean, if i had half the cash they do to spend at hot topin, i'd be beating fucking oZZy right now, and that's pretty  evil.

i also like disturbed, i've been listening to them a lot lately, and i'm further impressed every time i slide in the cd. and for christ's sake, when are they going to get a new bassist, their current one SUX. i looove the drummer, he's got skills, and he's ficking hot as hell.

and again, i'm probably going to be writing about 4-5 times a day, so enjoy my life, eh."

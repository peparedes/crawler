"event","story number two: Vanishing Sunset

one more day of school, and then it's done, Moira Hastings told herself as she sped down the highway past the beach. i'm sure i can survive one more day.

the sun was shining brightly over the crystal-clear ocean, the sound of seagulls flooding the air. early surfers jogged onto the sand, eager to catch a few waves before the crowds arrived. she wished she was out there with them, wind rushing at her, cool water splashing about. just wait till this weekend, she reminded herself.

rhitmoor high school was just up Ocean Highway, about a ten minute ""speedy"" drive from her parent's lovely mansion in the hills. Dr. Drake Hastings, Moira's father, was the founder of the Haster Corporation which owned laboratories all over the world. his once brilliant partner, Mason Foster, died last summer in a plane crash. they never found the plane or any of the bodies. so, Drake was left with all of the responsabilities. he was handling things very well. the corporation makes at least 260 billion dollars a year.

needless to say Moira, her older brother Charlie, and her parents have lived a wonderful life. money problems are two words never spoken together by any of them.

she parked her dark green BMW in the spot marked ""Senioirs Only!"", one of many that lined the first three rows of the parkinglot. being a senior had it's advantages. she thought about what a fun four years it had been. what with cheerleading, drama, photography, yearbook, volleyball, FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America), and honor society, Moira's time had been spread over pretty thinly. the way she looked at it was if you could only do it once, you might as well be the best at it.

that attitude gave her cheer captain, volleyball co-captain, the lead in most of the school plays, and president of FBLA. in fact, she was off to Princeton in the fall on a drama AND volleyball scholarship. her family and friends were so proud of her. 

Moira sighed as she got out of the car and closed the door. she realized it would be the last time she would arrive as a student.

""Hey, girl!"" a familiar voice called out behind her. Moira turned to find her best friend, Kaitlen Crook, jogging over to her. 

""Why the long face, Mo?"" Kaitlen asked. ""You look sp depressed.""

""Just sad to be leaving, i guess, Kay,"" Moira replied, starting to walk towards campus. ""I didnt realize how much i was going to miss this old place.""

""Me too,"" Kaitlen said. ""All the memories. in fact, you're about to make one of your own today, Mo.""

Moira laughed. ""What on earth are you talking about? i think someone's had way too much suger in their cereal this morning.""

""Oh, no you dont!"" Kaitlen teased, turning to face Moira walking backwards down the ahllway. ""I knoe what you're up to. you're trying to get out of asking Evan MacAllister to come along this weekend, arent you?"""

"event","ever since erik james was a young boy, he knew there was something out there. something strange, but magnificent. something no one had ever seen or heard of before. so unheard of, no one would believe it if they did hear it. erik was the kind of guy who kept an open mind to everything.

the weatherman predicted sunny skies that afternoon. not a cloud in the sky. however, not five minutes after erik arrived at hayward college on his bike, it started to pour.

students scrambled around with things such as newspapers, folders, and backpacks over their heads. they huddled underneath trees and awnings like cows escaping flies. the sky was as dark as midnight, and heavy with thick, black thunder clouds. flashes of lightning danced through the sir every few minutes. there was a slight, icy wind blowing through the leaves. it was a depressing sight to erik as he ran through campus with his backpack on his head. his first class was clear accross campus. his sneakers squeaked on the soaked concrete.

as he turned the last corner, he saw her. she was just turning to walk inside the doors of their history building."

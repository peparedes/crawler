To win back your love again 
I will be there, I will be there 
Love, only love 
Can bring back your love someday 
I will be there, I will be there 
I'll fight, babe, I'll fight 
To win back your love again 
I will be there, I will be there 
Love, only love 
Can break down the wall someday 
I will be there, I will be there 
If we'd go again 
All the way from the start 
I would try to change 
The things that killed our love 
Your pride has built a wall, so strong 
That I can't get through 
Is there really no chance 
To start once again 
I'm loving you 
Try, baby try 
To trust in my love again 
I will be there, I will be there 
Love, our love 
Just shouldn't be thrown away 
I will be there, I will be there 
If we'd go again 
All the way from the start 
I would try to change 
The things that killed our love 
Your pride has built a wall, so strong 
That I can't get through 
Is there really no chance 
To start once again 
If we'd go again 
All the way from the start 
I would try to change 
The things that killed our love 
Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know 
What you've been through 
You should give me a chance 
This can't be the end 
I'm still loving you 
I'm still loving you, I need your love 
I'm still loving you 


Tryin' to say I'm sorry, didn't mean to break your heart 
And find you waitin' up by the light of day 
There's a lot I want to tell you, but I don't know where to start 
And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away 
Ooh, baby I tried to make it, I just got lost along the way 
But every time I look at you, 
no matter what I'm goin' thru, it's easy to see 
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you, 
seem to come easily 
'Cause you're everything to me 
I never really wanted to let you get inside my heart 
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending 
I thought it wouldn't matter, if it all just came apart 
But now I realize I was just pretending 
Ooh, baby, I know I hurt you, but you can still believe in me 
But every time I look at you, no matter what I'm goin' thru, 
it's easy to see 
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you, 
seem to come easily 
'Cause you're everything to me 
It's gonna take a little time to show you, 
just what you mean to me, oh yeah 
It seems the more I get to know you, the more I need to make you see 
You're everything I need, yeah 
Oho, I need ya, I need ya, I need ya... 
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, I know I hurt you, 
but you can still believe in me 
But every time I look at you, no matter what I'm goin' thru, 
it's easy to see 
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you, 
seem to come easily 
'Cause you're everything to me 
You're everything to me, you're everything to me 




Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight 
Someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight 
Somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer 
That we'll find one another in that dream somewhere out there 
And even though I know how very far apart we are 
It helps to think we might be wishin' on the same bright star 
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby 
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky 
Somewhere out there if love can see us through (love can see us through) 
Then we'll be together somewhere out there 
Out where dreams come true"

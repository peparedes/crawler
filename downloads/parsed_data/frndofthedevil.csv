"event","I have to face my fears on Saturday,  I really don't want to and if I could I would just run and hide.  But I can't, so now I have to march forward and just suffer through the anxiety and whatever residual effects it has.  I wish I could just move away, and start a whole new life with all new people and places.  Sometimes I just wish.......well whatever I could wish for alot of things....maybe if I wish for shitty things to happen I could then find a sense of peace, because shitty things always happen....and then all my whishes would come true."

"event","Well, the wildwood flower grew wild on the farm and we never knowed what it was called, some say it's a flower, some say it's a weed, but we never gave it much thought. Till one day we was walkin along and my brother Bill reached down for a weed to chew on. Well, it took the rest of that day, and most of that night to find my brother bill, and when we did he was naked sittin on top the windmill.  I yelled Bill come on down from there, and sure enough he did.  He'd never done nothin like that before so I asked him why.  He said I don't know I was chewin on this here weed. I SAID WELL LET ME GIVE IT A TRY!  Well before too long man came out from Washington to see about this wildwood flower, and his eyes turned as white as a sheet.  He dug and he burned, and he burned and he dug, and he killed all our pretty little weeds.  Then he got in his car and as he drove he waved, so we smiled back and waved, just a sittin on those sacks of seeds!"

"event","i got a five dolla rock from a nigga on the run
a twelve gauge mossy pump pistol grip shotgun
a twenty stack three dolla bills yall got none
don't tell me this time that ya heard this one

ladies i got'em and won't hit the bottom
papers i twist'em with liquid i blot'em
i been to all the show's rolled with grouppie ho's
been a rockstar on x how many nights nobody knows

so why then can't i stand by and get high
watchin other niggas puff down put a rage in my eye

and that shit don't thrill me

big said ""do'n better now""
""wear'n gucci leather now""
but for me it don't do it
i can see through it

i liked the days of old
when the case was cold
i could run through the streets
and the pace was bold

but now they got me on the bracelet
the phone they might trace it
they got laptops in the cruiser
with a blow up of my face shit

i can still out run'em
probably even out gun'em
but it leeds to the place
a jump suit and a game face

i don't need that shit again
local county or a state pen
a place i already done been

which brings me back
to a crazy white horse mescalito
and a panama jack

who's in the junk camp
do'n nitrous with a bunk stamp
that got ya into the show
for just a couple rails of blow

and don't nobody know
just how far this shit could go

"event","I'm having a hard time with wanting to smoke pot lately. I have no interest what so ever in alcohol any more....it always lands me in jail or to a black eye I am truly disgusted with it...I'm going to two step meeting an one closed discussion meeting every week....that has been keeping me on track....clean that is...but I just keep thinking about pot all the time...i haven't even been playing music...I look at my guitar (fender semi solid telecaster)and just think about how I wish I could smoke a bowl and jam some space or antelope till I'm soaked in sweat. But then I don't even get up and jam because i get all depressed that I can't puff. 
God, when will I ever stop craving pot....WTF..the fact is I play a thousand times tighter when I'm sober....but i don't know it's like I'm punishing myself for wanting to smoke by not playing...I remember when Jerry died and Bob said that what made him sad was not that Jerry loved drugs more than his band members.....but that he loved drugs more than he loved THE MUSIC....fucking A....I love the music man I love it....I need to get out of this funk...any suggestions would be gratefully appreciated.

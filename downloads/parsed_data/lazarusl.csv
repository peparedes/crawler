"event","I caught part of a ZZ Top concert on cable last night and it just reminded me how much I love the Power Trio.  The power trio band really got big in the 60's but the first one in Rock and Roll was probably Buddy Holly.  Buddy Holly and the Crickets started out as a 4 piece, Buddy singing and guitar, a rhythm guitarist, upright bass player and drummer.
After a year or so the 2nd guitarist left and Buddy stuck with 3 piece for recording and touring.  
	 The Power Trios that changed everything was Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience.  Well Hendrix the music landscape for everything rock really, which is remarkable considering the short amount of time he was recording.  While Clapton's career has spanned something like 40 years Cream was only a couple albums and a couple years together, but with Jack Bruce on bass and sharing vocals and Ginger Baker on Drums the trio kicked ass and wrote a couple of immortal tunes in White Room and Sunshine of Your love.   There are probably a few more from the 60's but none come to mind.
The 70's would bring us ZZ Top, Rush and The Police, all who would get even bigger in the 80's.  Though the three bands would sometimes use keyboards on theirs recordings, live it was back to the basic PT format.  Rush even finds ways to keep the power trio and still play all keyboards parts as well.

The 90's brought a whole new age of power trios to the forefront, Sublime, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Green Day, Everclear and the new king of all power trios Nirvana.

I'm sure there are also quite a few PT groups in the 2000's but only Los Lonely Boys come to mind right now as I don't follow bands as closely any more.  I also should add that there are a LOT of bands that are technically musically a power trio but with the addition of a singer.  the Who, Queen, Led Zeppelin, the Doors, Black Sabbath, Stone Temple Pilots  and lots more I'm sure I'm forgetting.
Well enough of my prattling."

"event","Ok  couple more books to review... 

<img src=""http://www.katrichardson.com/images/PoltergeistSmall.jpg"" alt=""Poltergeist cover"" width=""300"" height=""451.5"" hspace=""5"" vspace=""5"" align=""Left"" border=""2"">
The 2nd Kat Richardson ""Greywalker"" book is titled  Poltergeist.   It's a nice followup to Greywalker and a I felt a faster read.   Here is a edited Blurb.


Premise:
Richardson's clever follow-up finds Seattle PI Harper Blaine investigating a deadly lab-made spook. Pacific Northwest University professor and psychologist Gartner Tuckman is trying to replicate the results of an actual '70s psychokinesis experiment, whose participants appeared to create a poltergeist. Tuckman's assistant provides fake phenomena to encourage the subjects' belief in their psychic abilities, but soon the experiment begins producing off-the-charts evidence of an actual specter. Harper is asked to look into who is messing with the experiments results and gets a murder mystery for the bargain.

Opinion:  I enjoyed Poltergeist quite a bit and at least as much as Greywalker if not more.  Many of the great supporting cast are back and a few more added to flush out the world Richardson is building.   If a reader is interested to pick up and read Greywalker , I won't have to bother suggesting they continue on with this one.


Next....

Strolling through Barnes and Noble on a spree to rejuvenate the economy, I ran across a table full of 1st of a series in a plethora of new and hip genre of supernatural mysteries.    I used my tried method of picking by cover and picked up a couple.   the 1st one I've read is Moon Called by  Patricia Briggs.  

Premise:
Mercy Thompson's life is not exactly normal. Her next-door neighbor is a werewolf. Her former boss is a gremlin. And she's fixing a VW bus for a vampire. But then, Mercy isn't exactly normal herself.  Mercy is a Walker able to change between human form and that of a Coyote. She was raised by Werewolves and understands the rules of the packs, but when Mercy tries to help a young untrained werewolf she gets herself in lots trouble on a scale she couldn't have imagined.

Opinion:
This book was so much better than I was expecting, I'd never heard of Briggs, but that isn't that big of a deal. Until a year ago I'd never heard of most of the people who work in this genre.  Her intricate description of Werewolves and their packs makes the story flow.  You don't really get the information till you need it in the story and I'm guessing there is a lot more she will elaborate on in the next few books.  I also like her take on Vampires, (yes there are vampires too).  They are really just cursory characters in Moon Called but I believe they'll play a much bigger part in the future installments.

Oh and I have a link below of someones elses research on Silver Bullets.  They did this after a couple gun enthusiasts chided her over the ammos inclusion in her book.
That's it for now, next author I'm going to read is Simon R. Green, another I wasn't familiar with but he's mentioned in the same sentences as Jim Butcher, which is good enough for me.

"event","I have a zen method of choosing books to read, or usually for the wife to read.  I stroll through and pick them by cover and title.  Most times I don't even read the flap blurb.
Funny thing is I have about 95% success rate on picking good books this way.

One of these selections was Kat Richardson's Greywalker.  The cover art is done by Chris McGrath (www.christianmcgrath.com) and I recognized his art from the Jim Butcher Dresden Files covers so I gave it a try. 
<img src=""http://www.katrichardson.com/images/GreyWalkerCoverSm.jpg"" alt=""Greywalker cover"" width=""300"" height=""450"" hspace=""5"" vspace=""5"" align=""Left"" border=""2""> 

Premise:
Greywalker introduces you to PI Harper Blaine, after an ugly run in with a fellow on a case Harper dies, briefly and as a carry-on luggage from her round trip ticket to the afterlife she can now see and move through the murky greasy Grey and all it's ghosts.  
Here is the official bit from her website.  I'll cheat because I've read a couple books since then and don't have it on hand.
	""Recovering from a near-fatal accident, Seattle Private Investigator Harper Blaine develops the ability to move through the Grey: the realm of ghosts, vampires, witches, and magic that exists between our world and the next. Harper wants her life to return to normal, but when her clients turn out to be paranormal, the reluctant Greywalker is drawn into the affairs of ambitious vampires and angry ghosts. As her cases converge, Harper uncovers a plot that threatens Seattle's Grey world and must choose between honor and survival.""

Opinion:
I really enjoyed the book and I thought the characters were well fleshed out and weren't cookie cutter cliches.    The supporting characters were as interesting as Harper her self and didn't didn't come across as just plot devices.
My only criticism (and my wife says I'm wrong) is that the rather involved description of the Grey mad the pace drag a few times.  This I will say doesn't carry over to the 2nd in the series Poltergeist which I will write up next.

If your into noir-ish detective yarns with supernatural twists, give it a read."

"event","On June 2 2009, My father's life came to a close.  After a year and 1/2 struggle with Mantle cell Lymphoma.  He was a strong man in many respects,  he wasn't even on pain killers for most of the time, and he was lucid up to just about an hour before he passed.
  
At the beginning of December his doctors sent him home to die telling us he wouldn't probably make it to Christmas.  Wen and I flew in to help bring him home from the hospital and ended up staying the whole week instead of just the weekend.   During that week he got somewhat stronger and better in spirits but his platelets were still too low and his system couldn't produce more.
  
We came back to Boston and worked for a week then drove back down early for Christmas break.  He was weaker but still talking like there was lots of time.  We stayed till the Dec 27th and drove back. 

My father had made us all a promise to not die during the holidays, both his mother and my mom's mother died around X-mas as well as Wen's mom on the day after x-mas a couple years back.  My and Wen's Wedding Annv is Dec 31 and we had 2 funerals on it in the last 5 years. He didn't want to make it 3.  So as a quite Blizzardy New Years eve came and passed here in Boston I marveled at my fathers resolve.  He and I had a good talk that day but I knew he was getting so weak.  I could here in his voice even compared to when we left to return to Boston.    On Jan 2 my mother called and let me know he was fading and a hour later called back to let me know he was gone.  

We flew home for a funeral service than he himself had planned right down to the music played and order to the minister to ""keep it short and sweet"".   

He wanted to beat the cancer but I have to admire how he left on his own terms."

My dad has had cancer for the last year, Mantle cell lymphoma.&nbsp; Incurable but treatable.  First symptoms were just about this time last year during a family vacation.  After the local small town doctors were stupid, baffled and spending equal amounts of time scratching their heads and asses, I found a way to get him into to Duke Cancer center.
They took very good care of him and besides a couple scary time when the&nbsp; he got very very weak from chemo he came through it well.&nbsp; We delayed the move to Boston till he treatment was done as he an mom stayed with us during treatment periods.&nbsp; About the time of the move He was starting to have problems again.&nbsp; That was May, now it's July, last week they went on a doctor approved vacation and he ended up spending it in the hospital in Fl.&nbsp; One or more of the tumors that had grown up in the last couple months has ruptured, the cancer is in his lungs. &nbsp;&nbsp; They made it back from Fl after stabilizing him, and he is now in the Hospital in NC, with pneumonia. It won't be long if he has pneumonia. &nbsp; We are flying out tomorrow morning and will stay at least till Sun depending what happens this week.&nbsp; 

Life may suck from time to time, but Death really sucks a whole lot more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not poetic or profound, just fucking accurate."

Lets see what's good in the world.....
*Saw Wall-E, possible Pixar's best and the Magician and his bunny short at the beginning was great too.  I'd recommend it to even the hard hearted out there.  Lots of Fun.
*Saw Wanted.... I enjoyed the film, nothing like the comic.  Had it been it would have made the worst movie..... something Uwe Boll would have done.  Don't know him?  <a href=""http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0093051/"" title=""uwe boll imdb"" target=""_blank"">Look him up.</a>  and see what cinematic abortions he's brought forth.
Anyway back to the movie... Wanted.  It was violent, unbelievable and a bit on the gory side.  Not a cinematic masterpiece and I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to most.  But I enjoyed it enough.

Lastly I am looking forward to the Dark Knight... methinks it will kick much ass.

George honestly had a unique way of phrasing an obvious truth that just made it funny, he could also go way far a field with outrageous statements that were equally funny. He had the subtlety of a brick through a plate glass window and he made me laugh.  He seemed to be less lighthearted with his attack on humankind as a whole since his wife died in the late 90's but he was still funny no matter what.

I don't hear a twang in my voice and apparently neither did most the southerners where I lived.  So why is it all the people here go ""Oh I figured you were from the south when I heard your accent.""  Is it southern to pronounce the syllables appropriately in words?  Not the south I'm used to.  But I'm guessing the difference is the letters left our or slurred.
Native to Boston no one pronounces R's.  Drawers become Draaws.  Park becomes Paak.  Car becomes Caw.... etc.  you get the idea.

"event","Ok here goes another attempt to use this journal thing.....
Wife and I now reside in Boston Ma.  It's mid May and the temp can barely get into the 60's.... so summer should be mild compared to NC.  I don't  even want to think about next winter.  They have real winter here... not that wannabe season that sits between fall and spring in NC.   
What's new?
New Job.... spiffy new job.  Sysadmin at MIT.   Not bad for a half ass like me.   I don't think I have ever felt dumber than when I walk in this place the first few times.  
I am slowly getting the feel for the team I'm a part of now, but there are a few oddities on the staff that I'm finding more difficult to break through with.

No house yet we have a contract on the one in NC, it going slow...
We have  a tentative close date for our condo here.. it's not without drama either.
The commute is another big adjustement... we were spoiled 10 mins to work if we hit all traffic lights.  Not so in Boston and neither are out sublet or future home is near the T (Boston trolley system)

No new friends yet and we miss the old friends.... some we fear we might not get to see for a very long time.

oh well that is life and that is change... end chapter 3 page 1."

"event","Kinda lost in thought over a conversation I just had with a nice young lady about being jaded and what brings you to that point.  I think for most people it would have to be dating/love. At first I was going to say the opposite sex but then figured that could be limiting as a descriptor.  I think for the most part this could be regarded as true.
For myself I have a bit of broader scope on the situation, I find that I constantly amazed at the links human nature can take us.  It can lead one person to do the most deplorable things or another of same  to risk their own ass to save someone elses.
I try not to put too much faith in people as a whole without throwing myself into the abyss hard core apathy. 
Oh my is it a fine line some work days."

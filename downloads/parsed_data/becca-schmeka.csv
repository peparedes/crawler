"event","Heyyy look its 10:00 in the morning and I'm writing in a livejournal haha. So this is what the world has come to...

Back from San Jose! Thankfully I did alright, even though I was really nervous going into it. Definitely had some nerves during my first couple matches. Yeah, I was listening to ""Good Riddance"" on the drive back home, and...I never thought I'd say this...but I think I might kind of miss it. The big supernationals I mean. Mostly because I see people there who I only get to see maybe four times a year. And despite all the psychotic tennis people, there are definitely the nice ones here and there. We've all grown up together, over the years, I suppose. 

Anyways! I got to see REEVE OLIVER last night. They rocked and they're hilarious on stage. Some other bands opened for them that I didn't know, but I liked Killfast Casino. The Real You had like a bunch of teenagers in it and then this one random like 30 year old. Weirdddd. I went to bed with my ears ringing, good feeling :)"

"event","Life is pretty crazy and/or busy. Not that I mind, and besides, I wouldn't have it any other way.

Bonfire tonight was cool, I'm all bonfire-d out though. We met some interesting guys from Alabama/Florida/etc. They also took one of our tikki torches, haha. Strange. And we had people from three continents- US, France, Australia...woahhh

Yeah nothing  big to report. Just going out a lot, summer rocks. Ballkids starts tomorrow so definitely amped for that. Been looking at the concert schedule for the rest of summer and into September October-ish. It's going to be so awesome, yessss I can't wait! I love music x 1000000.  

Heyyy look at that it's almost 1 in the morning so I better be getting to bed. 



i just want you to know
that i've been fighting to let you go
some days i make it through
and then there's nights that never end
i wish that i could believe
that there's a day you'll come back to me
but still i have to say
that i would do it all again
just want you to know

"event","There's seriously something with me and writing these things in the morning. Weirddd. Anyways, so glad to be home! The weather here is lovely...no more 100 degree-90 percent humidity-108 heat index-random massive thunderstorms (actually, I liked that last part...) type of thing. 

EVER. AGAIN. HAHA. It feels so good. 

Just been hanging out since then. Dinner, orientation, movie, beach, etc. Ballkids is coming up soon! I'm so excited for that, it's going to be fun.  Yeah I'm a kid at heart. 

What's up with there being something I want to go to but having to leave that day?! I left when Wedding Crashers opened, and Plain White T's, Allister, Gatsby's American Dream, and a few others are coming the day I have to go. Clearly this is some type of scandal/conspiracy. Arrrr. 

I'm so confused about some things. Ahhblahhheughhh23@#)#048092)*(^&





Oh and by the way, Lance Armstrong is amazing and he is my hero :)"

"event","The past few days have been cool, home alone...yeah! I love it, the independence, scheduling things when I want to, going out when I want to, whatever. 

Saturday I took Elise and Jeremy to World Curry, which is in PB, and then we went back to Jeremys house and watched Oceans 12. The part near the end where the guy explains how he got through the random movement motion detector things pretty much killed the entire movie for me. So I like the first one better, haha. 

Sunday morning I went to early bfast with Brian and Jeremy at ihop, had tennis, and at night I took TOMMY to World Curry (yes that's two days in a row) and  came back to my house and started Remember the Titans. Thennn Logan  called and him & Kevin came over, with their friend Sammy, and we all hung out. After they left, me and Tommy watched the Yellowcard DVD because it is just that awesome. 
 
Yesterday I had tennis of course, and then I hung out with Anthony. We ate dinner at TGI Fridays (sesame jack chicken strips = godly), went to Tower Records, and watched Old School, which was really funny. I hope I get to see him again before I leave? 

Tonight I went to Jeremys house, then got some food with Logan at Red Robin. There was this weird guy sitting near us who kept looking over every ten seconds...creepy. We both came to the conclusion that he had the hots for Logan. Then Jeremy, Elise, Brian, and Tye joined us and we chilled, and then we went to the awesomest playground in the history of playgrounds, which I also took Anthony to yesterday haha. But after a while this guy yelled at us. He said this was our ten minute warning, that he'd called the police, and told them there might be drugs involved. Yeah so we left haha. What an ass. 

After I came home I played basketball with Jee. Basically, I rock. Nine in a row, damn straight! It was kind of hard to see though because one of the street lights wasn't on for some reason. 

haha okay Im going to bed."

WARPED TOUR WAS AMAZING. 

We saw...My American Heart, Armor for Sleep, Fall Out Boy, Matchbook Romance, Hidden in Plain View, Underoath, Senses Fail, Dropkick Murphys, The Starting Line, All American Rejects...and probably more that I just don't remember right now. I was sad because Amber Pacific didn't play, but we went to their tent, and they were really nice...I think we were stalking their lead singer for a while, haha. 

Damn, that was awesome. Granted, it brought back some memories, and I'm still not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 

Is it possible to be super happy but kind of sad/nostalgic at the same time? I'm afraid no little mood smiley face thing can cover both at once."

First day went to Ben Browns party, where I fell in love with trampolines. Saturday...oh yeah I hung out with Anthony. Batman was sold out so we came back to my house, and I rocked him at basically everything :P Sunday I went to lunch/saw Batman with Britt and Tye. It was really good and definitely suprised me, go see it if you havent. Mondayyy I went to Logans house (its amazing) and we went to the beach with Justin, and then Kev came at some point. Tuesday I hung out with Britt- haha we have the greatest conversations ever. Wednesday I watched Mitchell suck at pool, we got In n Out, listened to him tell racist jokes, etc. etc. Thursday I went to the fair and saw Spin Doctors with Logan and Kev which was fun. Yeah were cool like that. Then we went to Starbucks, and then the beach. The water was glowing because of the red tide, it was pretty :) Fridayyy was a JB^2 day, me and Brian rented Stealing Harvard, which Jeremy hated HAHA. Then we went to the beach until like midnight, good times. Yesterday me and Jeremy went to the beach again, then at night night me Jeremy and Mika went to Golden Spoon, then the car wouldnt start, and then when we got home we watched Monsters Inc.

Friday I saw Star Wars with some of my studs which was fun. We also went to Rubios which is always a plus! Taquitos = love. 

Saturday had a tourny up in LA, ended up defaulting the second match so I could get back in time for PROM. Which was awesome, good times. Our limo was pimp too. And KC has an amazing house! 

Yeah so Sunday I had to play two matches on like four hours of sleep. I also managed to faceplant during my first match. It was weird...I swear I was just running, and then I fell over. You can laugh I dont mind :) 

Thennn yesterday I went to calc in the morning, rushed to the tourny, had a super long match, came back, edited my damn author project paper, went to Barnes for a meeting, came back, and did more homework until one in the morning. Woke up at 530 to go to the tourny, lost, came back, went to physics, bombed all three quizzes, and now Im home.

You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Last night I saw Sahara with Logan and Justin. Justin left early, movie ended... it was alright, Anthony met with us, we went to Starbucks (it was freeeeezing), then Logan left and me and Anthony hung out for a bit. My dad made me come home kind of early, which I was suprised about, and then John Lee called, and he came to my house and we sat outside talking, about random stuff. And we bugged Jee, and I laughed a lot because theyre terrible people :P Then I went back into the house, my back was killing me... dont know whats wrong with it. 

Yesterday I was semi worrying about Anthony because his myspace said ""divorced"" (yes I know, you can call me retarded), but Alex basically implied that I was being really stupid if I was basing my worry on a myspace. He called it asian paranoia, haha. And Logan said everything seemed fine, so I stopped worrying :)

I feel a little bit bad for the pitcher though (emphasis on 'little') because he walked home the winning run. Haaaa, I wouldnt want to be him on the bus right now. But Nady was up anyways so in any case, we probably would have scored a run somehow. 

This week has been nice, havent really done anything out of the ordinary. I had a tournament so that took up the first couple days which I was super bummed out about because I had thought this would be the first spring break without one (wrong). But after whining nonstop to my parents I finally went home after foreverrrr. 

Monday Anthony came over for a little...he cracks me up :P On Tuesday he went with me, Brian, and Jeremy to Fidels. After we dropped them off, we went to this park that I didnt think was a REAL park, but I guess it sort of is, whatever! Last night I grabbed Brian and we got Starbucks =D and went to Blockbuster to rent a movie. Jeremy refused to watch Dodgeball so we were going to get After the Sunset or something, but the guy wouldnt let us because I ""wasnt under the account""... that was bullcrap. So we drove to Jeremys house, and went to get Coldstone. And just sat on the steps talking, it was nice :) We decided were going to Europe next summer and that were all going to live in New York after college, haha. Then we went back to Jeremys house and hung out. I really suck at pool. And they tried to kill me under Jeremys love sac huge bean bag thing and I couldnt breathe. Anyways, today I went to the beach with Alex, Jeremy, and Logan (Brian ditched us)...it wasnt as hot as I thought it would be, so the water was freezing. I found this like, ten foot bamboo stick/pole thing but they kept trying to steal it those poopers. Then we got RUBIOS, woo! I went home, watched the Padres game, talked on the phone, was going to hang out with Logan and Ben, but madre was in major nazi mode. Oh well. She said some prrreeetty ridiculous things, it was almost funny. 

Right now I smell like some serious menthol. lol. Because I injured my back so I have those icy hot patch things on it, and I like, smell myself walking around. Yep.

I had a really shitty day yesterday, and those are generally pretty rare for me, so yeah...it sucked. Usually I dont let things get to me, either that or I just dont care haha and let it go, but for some reason I cracked a bit yesterday, it was pathetic. I guess its good once in a while to let everything out. Brian tried to cheer me up though, I have awesome friends, what would I do without you guys?! 

Umm...what else did I do...oh I talked to Anthony on the phone for a while. He was eating cold pizza at night when clearly its better in the morning! And he got into the college he wants so congrats to him =D Its so weird, I can get so paranoid about him sometimes, not cause I dont trust him. Just because I assume a lot of stuff and overanalyze, something Im wayyy too good at. Its like an immediate action that I cant stop and its annoying like no other, but Elise is my therapist and were working on it <333 (by the way, she is cooler than you)

School really sucks, my parents, especially my mom, are going to flip when they find out how bad Ive been doing lately. Ahhhh.

Break has been pretty good so far. Highlight was definitely Friday cause I went to see Matchbook Romance with Anthony and Tommmy, it was so much fun. There were lots of guys with girls pants, which looks kinda uncomfortable, but whatever floats your boat. I think its kind of funny that Ive seen The Matches more times than Ive seen Yellowcard, haha. 

Thursday I went to our schools play with some people, which was really good! What else...watched Friday Night Lights at Alex's house yesterday with Brian, since Hitch was sold out. It was pretty good, but not as good as Remember the Titans :P 

Hmmm...Oh, today, I hung out with Brinig and Ali. We got Coldstone, yes!

Annnddd last but not least, Anthony is the best! At the concert, he had his arms around me like the whole time which was nice =D Were a phat Matchbook Romance singing duo. Hazaah.

Today we were going to watch Friday Night Lights, but we ended up going to poker at Dan's house, which was fun. Me and Brian were a 'team' and we didnt know what in gods name we were really doing, but we did win the pot once on a straight OH YEAH. Alex has an awesome guitar and an even more awesome amp. 

Four day weekend baby, yeah! Its about time too, this week was such a biatch. Im looking forward to sleeping in and hangin out a lot and for the first time this year, I dont have ANY homework. Zilch. None. Nadaaaa. Mother of pearl, its a miracle. Hopefully my dad will be around to defend me from the grasp of my slightly overbearing mother of mine so I can go out and have fun with my spiffy friends. 

Oh yeah, and Anthony is hilarious.

Life has been alright lately, this past weekend was one hell of a sucker cause I was studying pretty much all the time for finals, which were not fun, especially today. Yeah, today was a killer. But now that its over I am mucho relaxo-ed and Im heavily considering watching Remember the Titans, but I might ditch that to play guitar...decisions, decisions. 

Me and Jeremy played a trick on Brian because he was super spazzing. Arent we evil? He said he was scared out of his pants, too...SCORE :P

The feeling will pass, this is really temporary, but I cant help but wonder...

Its pretty sad how like, one thing, or one person, can 'ruin' my day. But its overreaction, something I seem to do very well at times. I always know its not a big deal, but I turn it into one and it bothers me because I think about it when it DOESNT MATTER. Its like I put a burden on myself, and I want to get rid of it, but I cant. Damnit.

Talking to Elise always calms me a little though, shes right. This is so trivial its not even funny. Things will be better tomorrow."

Its raining pretty hard right now! Its kind of scary driving in it, theres like water waves all around you and its hard to see, but turning up the music really loud makes everything better :)

Were not going to talk about the game okay?! Im still not over it, we had our chances but whats done is done, hopefully next year. I must say though, I wanted us to win SO badly so that if we did play the Steelers, I could bother Anthony :P 

Moms really not being very cool at the moment. I dont know what I did to set her off, actually, Im pretty sure I didnt do a damn thing, but shes given me so much crap this weekend. Maybe its the very late afteraffect of me not doing super duper good at winters, who knows. Im sick of it though. Now she thinks Im lying to her whenever I tell her I want to go out with (insert name here). And then after that she throws a fit. What the hell, I thought I was a pretty good kid, but nope, not good enough for her. At this rate Ill have to be named a saint or something to get some slack from her. But anyways...

This is funny, Alex is such a good son- 

: and decided to play a prank on my mom
: i roll into the driveway and call her on my cell
: ""yea mom, i dont know how to say this but i got in an accident""
: ""your kidding me""
: ""nope""
: meanwhile i walk in the house on my cellphone
: ""hey mom""
: ""alex be quiet you brothe rjust got in a car accident""
: ""o ok""

Mika and Kiyo came over and we baked brownies. So of course, being the genius I am, I measured out a cup of vegetable oil and dumped it in, but that was the amount you needed for forty brownies, not twenty. So we ended up making forty, haha! The more the better, right?

I got to see Dana, Esther, and Diane today! Which was really cool, hearing what they said about college makes me want to go even more, if thats possible.

Tonight I met up with some people to go see Meet the Fockers but it was sold out! So we finally decided to rent a movie- me and Ali insisted on The Prince and Me, and we got some other one just in case. Then we went on over to Kevins house, oh, and Logan has a really cool Escalade. And it get points because he let us turn on Yellowcard really loudly. Anyways, moving on, we made cookies har har har and then we made the guys watch our movie :D Deep down, they loved it, we could tell by how rivited Daniel was, because Sean kept waving his arms around trying to get his attention and Daniel didnt notice at all, ha. Thennn we busted out the ping pong table, and it was freezing outside. Kevin has a really cool bass guitar too. Good times.

30 Things Guys Should Know About Girls


`READ AND LEARN`

`1. Whatever you do, don't just show up at their house...they run around in their underwear just like we do. 

`2. DO NOT CHEAT ON THEM. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about anything. Trust me, they WILL find out and you will be mud. 

`3. Beware of every single male relative and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your ass at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the damn hat.

`4. NEVER miss an opportunity to tell them they're beautiful. 

`5. DON'T refuse to kiss in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's beacuse they're jealous.

`6. If they slap you hard, you DESERVED it. 

`7. DON'T be afraid to touch them if you want to. If they're going out with you in the first place, it's because they like being in your arms. 

`8. If you DON'T sleep with them, DO NOT tell your friends that you did. 

`8.5. If you DO sleep with them, DON'T tell your friends that you did. 

9. You CAN be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it.

`10. NOT all of them eat like birds, a lot of them eat like whales.

`11. Most of them DON'T mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a pussy. 

`11.5. Do you honestly need all your money that much? Be a man, pay all the time.

`12. Every girl should eventually get THREE THINGS from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring. Even if it's not a serious relationship. 

`13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you arn't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely.  

`14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to kick the shit out of him.

`15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer. 

`16. NEVER, ever slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, ""Oh you're so dumb"" or something, never make any gestures back. 

`17. Go to a chick flick one in a while. She DOESN'T care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went. 

`18. You're dead meat if you CAN'T get along with her pets, parents and best friends. Be PRINCE CHARMING to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals.

`19. DON'T flirt with their moms

`20. DON'T be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like shit, so be UNDERSTANDING.

`21. If you don't like the way they drive or the way they do something, you do it.

`22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend.

`23. DON'T stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you. 

`24. If they complain that something hurts, rub it for them without being asked. 

`25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/westling, be very GENTLE.

`26. Memorize their god damn birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life. 

`27. DON'T marinade the cologne, but smell good.

`28. DON'T give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice, even it cost under 20 bucks. 

`29. If you think the relationship isn't going to last, don't wait to find out. It will only hurt you more if you draw it out.

`30. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, prividedge and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nonosecond."

"event","I always say that Im going to update this, but never find the time. Well right now, Im bored out of my mind and stuck in a hotel room so why not ramble some in this thing, eh?

Oregon was so much fun! It seems like forever ago, probably because this week was so long. I got to meet a lot of new people, we played a lot of ping pong, anddd me and Molly ate tons of MnM's because we were total zombies in the morning- needed sugar to wake up (I dont think that ever happened, haha!) Good times...Spencer wins for most adorable when we found him sleeping against the window/ underneath the table. Darren (he was our coach) is beyond hilarious, he has the best stories. He told us he used to be the drummer in a band called ""Smooth Vanilla Shake"". Now comon, you cant say that didnt make you laugh. Alrighty, enough about that. 

Lets see...Tuesday I went to the CIF game, speaking of which- CO CHAMPIONS?! What the hell, thats just weird. You cant tie in the championship game, thats the dumbest rule Ive ever heard of. Theres only room for one first place, one team at the top, and it should have been us. Oh well, technically weve 'won' two years in a row, althought I dont exactly round a tie as winning. I feel bad for our kicker, people are probably giving him a lot crap for not making that one, cause we would have won if he did. I would feel so bad.

Thursday our tennis team (er, well, some of us) drove up to see the George Lopez Show which was by far one of the coolest experiences Ive ever had and definitely worth the drive. First, we got to go to this room where they had an whole bunch of food, and being the team that we are, we ate and ate and ate. Good thing we dont work there, theyd have to restock every few hours :P So then we get to the studio, and you have the set and the audience sitting a little bit higher up and in between scenes, theres this warm up guy that entertains the audience. He was SO funny. So so so so funny. We were laughing our ASSES off, especially when he started charting relationships between girls and guys. Mannn it was funny. And when he started telling this one joke, I SO knew the answer (cause Anthonys told me that joke before :P)and I really wanted to shout it out, but I resisted. 

Oh, right before we went to our seats, we had to go through a metal detector. So of course, it never crossed my mind that a can of soda would set it off or anything, and I went through, and he backed me up, and the guy looked at me like I was the biggest idiot EVER. And then made a comment about how I was being a stereotypical athlete, haha!

So that was a recap of the last week or whatever. 

And now, Im at a tournament I really dont want to be at (you knew I had to complain at some point) because I want to see my friends. Ive been so busy the last month, Ive had like zilch time to hang out. Im so confused about tennis, sometimes I wonder if I even like it. I mean, I do, I think I just get tired of it? Especially when it takes up all my weekends and stuff. Maybe if I wasnt so...whats the word, social? then it wouldnt be such a problem... 

I tried talking to my mom yesterday about letting other people drive me, and all she could say was ""Well what if...and what if..."" OKAY Im not going to get into a car with some kind of lunatic. Seriously, I wish she would just trust my judgement. No, scratch that, I wish she would just trust me period, because she doesnt. 

Anywaysss, Im gonna go play the guitar some more. If you read through all that, youre crazy.

Robert: I dont even want to tell you what Becca did last night...
Joyce: My imagination is running wild
Robert: Well, youre on the right track...

Hmmm...Brian wrote another pretend Becca diary entry in history a few classes ago, but its too long to type the WHOLE thing out, so heres a little bit of it:

""I passionately roll down the hill with Ryan Key in my arms. However, I was only dreaming, and in reality it was a fat pig. Yes, that is symbolic. Brian is such a deep thinker (Ryan is represented by the fat pig)...Right now, in history class, I am being the biggest control freak and being a dork.

Only five more days till winter break! Free for two weeks. 

Kind of out of the blue, but I love my friends so much (wait, I dont have no friends :P) Theyre always making me laugh! Sometimes I wonder what will happen after high school, like, do we all just go our separate ways and never really talk again? Hmmm...guess only time can answer that one.

First things first: its FREEZING. I thought that since I just came back from Missouri where it was 'bloody' cold, here would be a piece of cake. A walkover. No worries. Well, I was wrong about that! My dad thinks theres seriously something wrong with me, because at TGI Fridays, I would have layers of clothing and and Id still be freezing. I think Im just bad with cold weather, even though I sort of like it. Oh and it snowed while I was there :) Not a snow storm or anything, but nonetheless, powder! I havent seen any since, a long time, maybe the last time we went to Europe, which was before sports started to take over all our holidays. 

Some hot chocolate or a chai sounds really good right now. 

Hmmm...break was nice, I just wish I had been in town longer so I could have hung out with friends more and NOT missed out on football, but anytime away from school is good for me. 

And can anyone say CHARGERS! Yesss, were in first place, by ourselves. Boo-yah. 

I love December (its not December yet, I know, Im just saying), holiday atmosphere is fun. 

Cant really think of anything else to ramble on about. It always seems like I have a lot to talk/write about when I start typing but after a bit, I forget. Yep, life is like that. 

Im going to go fiddle around with my guitar! Im so excited, even yesterdays chaos cant deterr me :P Mucho thanks to Kevin for helping me with the string. I still cant quite believe I snapped it. Good job Becca! My dad was furious, but not at me, haha.  

Oh wait, happy belated birthday to Bobby :)

So last night we (Jeremy, Brian, Mika, Ronnie Poo, Kevin) all went to Souplantation to chow down, good times. There was this guy there wearing this wetsuit material bright bright yellow...thing. It was beyond hilarious, mostly because he had a serious case of the man-boobs. 

Hmmm so today I tried to sleep in, but I woke up at 630 anyways, not what I planned to do. I got to see Anthony, which was cool cause I havent seen him in a while. Aw mannnn I love that kid, hes awesome :) Him Ryan and me went to TGI Fridays, mmmm

The other day in history we were watching a really boring movie about the Civil War so Brian wrote a pretend Becca diary entry:

""My name is Becca. I am 16 years old. I know how to drive. I play tennis everyday, and my favorite professional tennis player is Justine Henin Hardenne [wrong]. She is my idol [wrong again]. I love Yellowcard, and everything around me reminds me of them. I cant stop thinking about my lover Ryan Key. Every violin I heard reminds me of Yellowcard.""

Music is so good. What would i do without it? 

In history today, Matt said the funniest thing. We were talking about Yellowcard (wonder how we got on that subject...not like I like them or anything :P) and he said ""Oh I have a Yellowcard hat! Its one of those...knitted trucker hats..."" instead of mesh, haha...it was funny, trust me.

And FINALLY we went to Souplantation with Ronnie- he got a cooler filled with ice water dumped on him...thats what you get for winning =P- and some of his people. When I came back to the table where we were eating, with a huge bowl of ice cream, Kevin (funny kid) said ""What animal did you kill to get THAT"" haha, good times. 

Saturday I had a tournament(suprise suprise) and didnt end up going to homecoming that night, just couldnt be bothered to because I was too tired. But I did make my dad take a detour so i could get the Yellowcard DVD. Go figure, haha. Sunday I went to IKEA to get a new bed, how random is that. The cool thing was when we left to go back home, the chargers were up by like, 13 points, and then by the time we got home, they were already up by 100000! Awesome.

Its been raining a lot lately :) Well, for this place, anyway. 

Im so bored, its time to go waste more time doing nothing. 

Adios!




And after all, youre my wonderwall..."

"event","Wooooo- were in the finals :) It was a close one though, jeez! 

My dad just said that when he was younger, he tried to play the guitar to impress girls. He also started talking really randomly about baseball earlier, I think maybe the time change has done something to him. 


Hang on or let go...hmmm..."

"event","The election is coming to a close...wonder who will end up winning. What peeves me is when people say ""F*** Bush!"" or ""F*** Kerry!"", yet they know nothing about politics, or what the candidates stances are on the issues. They look around them, and see who else 'everyone' seems to be cheering for, and hop onto the bandwagon. Not that I know anything, but I dont go around supporting Kerry/Bush just because my friends are for one or the other. If you know your facts, then great, everyone can have their own opinion...but if youre just saying something so you can say something (does that even make sense?) then I think its stupid. 

I thought about Gho the other day during my match, it was really kind of random. I miss seeing him in class lounging on the couch, with his red shirt on and big sunglasses =/ And I wish I knew what to say to make my friends feel better. Bleh.

My dad came home today. Cool. 

They didnt have the YC DVD at Warehouse. Not cool. 

This entry is pretty random, eh?"

A lot on my mind I guess you could say, but I dont really feel like typing it all out. Thats why its time to copy/paste- Ronnie (we still need to do Souplantation) had this stuff up a while ago, I thought some of it was true, so here it is...enjoy.


Troubled teens and worried parents....Wear Sunscreen.

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.
The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.  I will dispense this advice now. 

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth.  Oh, never mind.You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded.  But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.

You are not as fat as you imagine.

Don't worry about the future.  Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind.  The kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.  

Do one thing every day that scares you. 

Sing. 

Don't be reckless with other people's hearts.  Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours. 

Floss. 

Don't waste your time on jealousy.  Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind.  The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself. 

Remember compliments you receive.  Forget the insults.  If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. 

Keep your old love letters.  Throw away your old bank statements. 

Stretch. 

Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives.  Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't. 

Get plenty of calcium.

Be kind to your knees.  You'll miss them when they're gone. 

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't.  Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't.  Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.

Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either.  Your choices are half chance.  So are everybody else's. 

Enjoy your body.  Use it every way you can.  Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it.  It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own. 

Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room. 

Read the directions, even if you don't follow them. 

Do not read beauty magazines.  They will only make you feel ugly. 

Get to know your parents.  You never know when they'll be gone for good.
Be nice to your siblings.  They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. 

Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on.  Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young. 

Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard.
Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.
Travel. 

Accept certain inalienable truths:
Prices will rise.
Politicians will philander.
You, too, will get old.
And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders. 

Respect your elders. 

Don't expect anyone else to support you.
Maybe you have a trust fund.
Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse.
But you never know when either one might run out. 

Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85. 

Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it.
Advice is a form of nostalgia.  Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth. 

But trust me on the sunscreen."

So, went to school this morning as usual and was DEAD tired because I didnt get enough sleep. The physics quiz was impossible, if I do say so myself aaannddd...yeah. Staying up till one studying didnt help too much there! Then I rushed home, went straight to tennis, and then came back home. On my way back, I was exiting the freeway, and there was a moving truck in front of me and a small car in front of that. And the guy in the car just like, randomly sticks his hand out the window. Er, his finger, I guess (the middle one, obviously) and I laughed because I thought it was funny. Then the guy behind me got super mad and the two little chickens were having some road rage and zigging and zagging over the place. It doesnt sound interesting, but it was. Because I said so.

I was in the weirdest funk in the afternoon. I didnt even feel like going out, which is VERY strange because Im really social person. Love being around people, talking, whatever. Usually Im dying to get out of the house. Too bad my mom doesnt really trust me, so she always gets mad when I go hang out with friends or something, or, she just doesnt let me go at all. Eh, weve been having a lot of arguments lately. Oh well...

Ended up going to the game even though I kind of wanted to go see Friday Night Lights instead. Met up with Mikey and got some STARBUCKS (yesssss) and then went to the stadium, which was packed. It was fun, and my voice is gone from all the yelling/screaming/cheering we were doing. 

Alright Im off,
later gators


rest in peace gho."

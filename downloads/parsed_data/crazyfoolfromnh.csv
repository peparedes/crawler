"event","... but life for me has been alright. I haven't really done that much lately, just played pool and worked out. I have started a reputation at some of the halls I go to. Probably because I've won two tournaments, of which I'm sure you guys don't care either. Anyway, I don't know if this applies to anyone, but I will be in Virginia for about a month, starting Friday. So if anyone is in that area for whatever reason, give me a call. Other then that, I will talk to you guys when I come back around New Years.

"event","Well it has been a while since I last updated this journal of mine. Today I returned from being out to sea for 5 days. I believe my ship I just destined to be underway for all major holidays of the year. I imagine I will receive some sort of derogative comment from some people by writing this post, just because that's how it normally is. Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice memorial day. Other then that, if anyone who would like to get in contact with me, and doesn't havc my new cell phone number, it is 1(603)233-8974.

"event","hey whats up peeps, just chillin down here, in sunny florida. havent heard too much stuff lately about nashua, but thats cool, cause not much happens there. the past two days its been raining, but other then that its been hot and sunny. pretty nice just wish i had a car. well my ship pulls in tomorrow, and i will be going on there, so im not sure when the next time is that i will get to use a computer. so if i dont get back to you for a while thats prolly why. hey      happens right. <b>on another note;</b>
<br>
these computers here, for some odd reason AIM doesnt work, so if you wanna contact me other then phone or email, you gotta use yahoo instant messanger. kinda odd cause you would figure that the navy would have top of the line computers, but no.. thats not how it works here. so if you get a yahoo name, just email it to me and ill add you to my list. by the way my messanger name is hainsworthr, really original huh?

<p>i mean if you dont youll always regret what you never did do in the past. finally, i leave you all with this, when i come back next time, only a certain few will know so it can be a bigger suprise.

"event","This is most likely going to get some remarks that are degrading but oh well, my message is for the better.  

I was unable to post in her journal, so I figured I would try and help out her situation, considering that last time I checked, I was friends with her or atleast a good aquantance. Now I dont know exactly what is bringing you to a lowered self emotional state, but I believe I can relate in some ways.
<br>
Now, me personally, I went through some of the most depressing times of my life in the past 2  months. Boot camp was not an easy thing for me. I believe it or not actually cryed. Why, because I thought that I was gonna be held back, and not be able to see my family after the scheduled 2 months. This is because I thought that I was going to get put back in training. Not being able to see any of your friends or family for 2 months straight is hard, as I am sure you can imagine. The main reason for this is because if you get in too much trouble, or just fall behind in the things you need to do, you get sent back a few weeks. I actually met a guy who had been in there for 6 months, just because he had injured himself.
<br>
Anyways, sure I am rambling on, but I wouldnt be able to get my crappy story across if I didn't. Basically what I am trying to say is that you gotta talk to people, let um know how you feel, and if they are your friends then they should listen, no matter how rediculous the circumstance. If need be you can talk to me.
<br>
Now I got that out of the way, I will be awaiting the storm of comments that come along with posts like this, most likely some will be from RCT. lol"

Then on top of that the asshole who runs the whole program wouldn't do fingerprints for me cause I had only turned in my info today, son of a bitch.</p>
<p>After that though, I went back to the barracks got dressed and shit, and went to get some burgers for lunch. Met a guy that I knew from bootcamp there, then he found out he was late for class and had to jet. After that went back home and chilled until now.</p>

Right now I am debating on whether or not I should go to a party in 2 weeks. Most parties that navy peeps throw get busted by the cops, means big trouble for them. So I mean go party, have fun, get drunk, all that good stuff. But still run a huge risk of getting arrested and lots of bad stuff, especially since Im under military law aswell. Well anyways, I finish my schooling here in Illinois the 7th of May. So I should be back in Nashua the 8th or so. Either way theres gonna be some parties, atleast there better be."

Making a serious commitment toward the one you love will open new doors for you. Although you pride yourself on being self-sufficient, the truth is you can only benefit from having a partner. A child or creative project could bring you closer toward a cherished goal. Feel free to release an emotional burden and adopt a more carefree attitude. You were meant to live a joyous life, so follow your bliss. (c)2003, Russellgrant.com (19June2003)

"event","Tonight after my indoor soccer game, I decided to race my freind Justin Jaskowitz. So we were both going about 100mph down the highway going in and out of cars, and thn when I was coming up to exit 4 I saw some flashing lights. ""blue"" flashing lights. So I pulled over and Justin kinda just sneaked away.
What he asked me:
<ol>
<li>Where were you going in such a hurry?
<br>
<b>To the weathervane restuarant to eat with my parents.</b>
<br>
<li>Was that your friend you were racing down the highway with to get to the weathervane?
<br>
<b>Yes</b>
<br>
<li>So do you know how fast you were going?
<br>
<b>About 80 I guess</b>
<br>
<li>Well see I clocked you at around 95
<br>
<b>Oh.... really, sorry about that</b>
<br>
<li>Do you know that the speed limit is here?
<br>
<b>Yes</b>
<br>
<li>Where abouts were you coming in such a hurry?
<br>
<b>Bedford, I was coming from and indoor soccer game</b>
<br>
<br>
<i>The list goes on but eventually after he came back to my car and said that I have to go to court on Feb. 15th. Then he told me a short story, he was like when I was younger I used to speed, and do stupid things like that. But when your going 95 it can be really easy to lose control and if you do, your done for. I just kinda agreed and then eventually after about 20 minutes i got to the weathervane restuarant.</i>
<p>
My parents had already known that I had been pulled over cause they passed me about 5 minutes later. It was kinda funny cause when I finally got there they just made fun of me, lol.
<p>The moral of this story is try not to be Jeff Gordon, unless you have a nascar."

Therefore, Morse got Renzi to take 3 buckets of water outside and ice up Palmer's truck. When I went outside later that night, after we had closed, I looked at Palmer's truck and seriously it must have had about half an inch of ice all over it.

After about a 45 minute drive made it to the mountain.
I went to Pats Peak w/ the whole England crew and went snowboarding. Became affiliated with the snowboard and now I'm a pro. (or so i think) After about an hour I found a jump and tried it a few times. Didn't land once, but i got some major air. Then we all went home after about 5 hours. Around 7 we went ot the Outback Steak House (and did not choke on any steak) and I had a burger. Came home once again and then just chilled for the rest of the night."

"event","I hate Christmas. I hate what It has become. Even though I'm not a devout Christian, I still don't like what stores are making it into. Michele Is ""worried"" about me, ans the last thing I want her to do is worry about me. I have plenty of worrying to do about her. I never went to her birthday party and I haven't got the guts to talk to her since. That was like a week and a half ago and the longer I drag it on, the worse I feel. hopefully it'll work itself out. that would make me smile.It would be a lot easier if she was back in NH. My birthday is tommorow, the big 16. I think my parent forgot though. I hope Lindsey go tthat pillow she promised back in the summer."

"event","Every Journal needs a first entry so here's mine. I miss TJ, I haven't seen him in a few days, which worries me because he's always around. I hope he went back to his turkey friends and wasn't shot or eaten or anything. I hope I get a new turkey for Christmas (It's the most stressfull time, of the year). I wan to have a new years resolution that I can actually keep like not letting people down, or being there for people who need me instead of doing what I do now. I miss needing someone and being needed. I miss waiting by the phone for hours waiting for a call just to talk on the phone for hours. I miss being missed. I want to be myself again. I want to have something all my own that gives me comfort. I don't want to have to deal with a band that's not going anywhere anymore. I don't feel comfortable with change but I think it's needed. I'm changing therapists now and I'll either have a new one (my forth one) or have to drive wicked far to see the one I have now. I don't want to do either. i don't want to be in counseling. I don't think she can help me with anything that I can't do myself, but I guess I don't have much of a choice."

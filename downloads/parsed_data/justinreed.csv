"event","<font face=""verdana""> <font size=1><center><b>Today was a decent day. Some psycho freak that Ive never met in my life keeps iming me,almost like we were best buddys. They say they're a girl who lives in some diff. part of N.Y, (I forgot which) and she keeps i.m.ng me asking how my day was and all these random questions. im startin to wonder if it's some old freaky diseased pedophile stalking me... Today was O.K. in science me,sarah,katie and josh were talking about me and how I stole these million dollar pearls and the F.B.I was after me and stuff! It was crazy, i escaped though. In lunch we were all shooting all kinds of food down haileys shirt. Then she beat me up and gave me a bloody nose and stuff...not really.Errr rest of the day was O.k i guess... then I stayed after with Mr. Kowanes who was a crabby ass for no reason but oh well. I have no plans for tonight which is pretty sad. me and Alyssa have decided our plans for tonight are sitting at our houses and picking our assholes! So at least I've got something fun to look forawrd to, right! YES! Im out, CYA

(Note: the computer psycho just imed me again! AHHH! I sent her the picture I put below and told her it was me. Hopefully now she'll stop iming me!)

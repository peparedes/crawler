"event","Alrighty so this is my new journal. And with a new journal comes new life and new meaning...all will change. And here is the starting point...and from now on an account of all things...

It's mid-october... two weeks before my two FAVORITE holidays of the year.. the first being Halloween and the second my birthday! Okay so my birthday isn't a holday, but it should be!! Anywho, this weekend is the annual MWD Employee picnic and its going to be at the most AWESOMA place...the ZOO!!! Donny and I are going to that early Sat morning and then Saturday night us and art and chavon and some other peoples are going to KNotts ScaryFArm!! Woot! I am so excited I been looking forward to this ALL year!!! Donny bought us some glowy bracelets and stuff already... oh man I can wait...

Speaking of buying, we... well TheDon bought another baby kitty on saturday night, (along with a kitty condo, kitty scratching post, automatic kitty box and auto kitty food and waterer... Donny went all out! LMAO) well were not sure if its a boy or a girl though, I guess its a little early to tell... it's just 6 weeks...we think its a little boy, we named him SIFU...if it turns out he's a she we'll call her SIMA. We brought Ally on tuesday night and as of today they seem to be getting along alot better...Although I have to admit having a new kitten around the house is like having a new baby... neither of us have slept since Saturday! LOL... He's getting better though, every night we seem to get a little more sleep! HAHA

Other than that things at work are going pretty well. The new ops manager seems to just adore me and my sells have been the top grossing for going on 3 months. BUt even though I sold at the top last month we didn't make goal...so hopefully this month we can pul it off so I can get some extra $$$$

So all in all I am pretty content. At this point I'm pretty much liking whats going on in my life right now and that doesn't come often...rigtht now I'm just counting the days until the big 2-0!!! Woot!"

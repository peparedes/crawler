I started a diary when I first got here, and then I totally stopped putting in entries and got lazy for the past 2-3 weeks, so I'll do this instead.  This way I get to share!"

"event","you guys are updating like crazy today!  so i took sis' color test and here are my results:

Your Existing Situation
Having difficulty making progress and unwilling to put forth further effort. Seeking more comfortable conditions where he can avoid anything disturbing. (i guess that's kinda true, school sucks shit right now and i really don't want to study)

Your Stress Sources
Wishes to be independent, unhampered, and free from any limitation or restriction, other than those which he imposes of himself or by his own choice and decision. (=vague)

Your Restrained Characteristics
Demanding and particular in his relations with his partner or those close to him, but careful to avoid open conflict since this might reduce his prospects of realizing his hopes and ideas.

Remains emotionally unattached even when involved in a close relationship. (this last part is NOT true.  although the first part's true)

Your Desired Objective
Wants to make a favorable impression and be rewarded as a special personality. Is therefore constantly on the watch to see whether he is succeeding in this and how others are reacting to him; this makes him feel that he is in control. Uses tactics cleverly in order to obtain influence and special recognition. Susceptible to the esthetic or original. (this makes me sound like a manipulative little bitch.  which is not true)

our Actual Problem
Seeks to avoid criticism and to prevent restriction of his freedom to act, and to decide for himself by the exercise of great personal charm in his dealings with others. (...everyone's like that though)

So I didn't think I'd like it, but then all this media and critic buzz about it made me curious, and then I found out it's Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson and I knew I had to see it.  It's not your typical Woddy Allen movie but it's great.  go watch it."

It's been a while since you last saw me
One breaks down and the other ones fade
These eyes can see the days break
Too late for the other's mistakes

Sit down laugh thinking what have we done
Let me inside
Is it all over before it's begun
Please give me some time

Cause we are running into the sun
Getting close to something into the sun
You know that we're falling
We're falling back into the sun

I never meant to let you go
Why did I leave maybe we'll never know
But I'm a man now broken on the ground
I'm in need and I think that it shows

All this time we're going nowhere and we know it
I was so blind
All the lights are leading to where you're going
I'm not far behind

And now we're running into the sun
Getting close to something into the sun
You know that we're falling
We're falling back into the sun

Into the sun
Into the sun
Into the sun

You know that we're running into the sun
Getting close to something into the sun
You know that we're falling
We're falling back into the sun"

Coming back 
Coming home
The queen of love enters the room
Silence ensues...
To the king what have you done to my life
Did you you take me for a fool or for a wife

And the king is in his court
Counting all his diamonds
One by one they do fall

Says the queen our pride the prince of spades is coming home
It'd be nice if you could spend some time alone
After all he's in line for the throne

And the king is in his court
Counting all his diamonds
One by one they do fall

So now just get up off your ass and
leave all your treasures behind
your son is coming home with you to spend time
show him how a good king should be
and don't ever forget the day
when your turned your back on him and me
still I stayed"

by James Blunt

""My life is brilliant""
My life is brilliant.
My love is pure.
I saw an angel.
Of that I'm sure.
She smiled at me on the subway.
She was with another man.
But I won't lose no sleep on that,
'Cause I've got a plan.

You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
I saw your face in a crowded place,
And I don't know what to do,
'Cause I'll never be with you.

Yes, she caught my eye,
As we walked on by.
She could see from my face that I was,
Flying/Fucking high,
And I don't think that I'll see her again,
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end.

You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
I saw your face in a crowded place,
And I don't know what to do,
'Cause I'll never be with you.
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
There must be an angel with a smile on her face,
When she thought up that I should be with you.
But it's time to face the truth,
I will never be with you."

It Can't Come Quickly Enough

Sailling through the tunnels 
In the morning by yourself 
There's a very special feeling 
True sensation all is well 
If you stand and reach your arms out wide 
Close your eyes and try to fly 
It's an underground illusion 
Tricking you from side to side 

We knew all the answers 
And we shouted them like anthems 
Anxious and suspicious 
That God knew how much we cheated 

It can't come quickly enough 
And now you've spent your life 
Waiting for this moment 
And when you finally saw it come 
It passed you by and left you so defeated 

Skyscrapers rise between us 
Keeping me from finding you 
If the concrete architecture 
Dissapeared there'd be so few 
Of us left to navigate and 
Defend ourselves from the tide 
It's an underground illusion 
Tricking you from side to side 

There's no indication of 
What we were meant to be 
Sucking up to strangers 
Throwing wishes to the sea 

It can't come quickly enough 
And now you've spent your life 
Waiting for this moment 
And when you finally saw it come 
It passed you by and 
Left you so defeated"

by Lifehouse

The sun goes down as the city lights
Pave their way through the darkest night
Raindrops fall as an old man cries
Never thought to ever think twice

Of all he had
Of all he lost
A selfish life
and guess comes with the cost

Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away
Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away

The same old streets just a different name
Same old house just the family's changed
Pickett fence
The window stains
Freedom spells by a man in chains

Silence is all we have to give
And the memories of a life I wish we'd lived

Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away

Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away

From all that you made
That you lost
or threw away
Traded in for a brand new life
But I can't
Can't let go
Can't turn around
Hold my head high and walk away

Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away

Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away"

Aaron came back from Korea and the apartment seems a lot livelier for some reason.  I watched Batman Begins last night with my friends, and I have to say that I LOVED it.  Perhaps I had low expectations, and it had some things that just didn't make any sense, but compared to what the other Batman movies and the Tv series were like, this is literally a work of art.  The art direction was amazing and Bruce Wayne actually felt like a real person in this movie.  Please go watch it!!

This is all true. September 7th. ""The clock is ticking....""
Written by Matt Lazzara

I don't think a lot of people sit around and contemplate their lives. I mean, people think about their futures and what they're going to do, and what they should have done in order to achieve something, but I don't think anyone contemplates their present. What they're doing right now. Everyone's heard of living in the moment or whatever, but I think very few people act on it. Myself included and that's something that I regret immensely.

Life is a finite thing. Obviously, everyone's life is going to end, but mine has a time limit. No surprises for me, and depressingly enough, that time limit is going to run out rather soon. I've never really told anyone how long I have left, or what exactly (in great detail) is wrong with me, because I would rather myfriends viewed me as a vital, volaile, rather silly human beings, but at age 21, most people don't understand or know how to contemplate the thought that someone you know, they would abandon me for more secure, lasting relationships.

So everyday, every minute is vital to me, the most mundane things are breaths of fresh air. The things that most people take for granted but shouldn't - a kiss, a pudding fight, a good long walk or an intriguing conversation - are now intensely important to me, and I think they should be important to everyone. The fact that I know I won't be able to experience these things makes them achingly more important to me, and they make me desparate to achieve them one more time.

I want to close my eyes and kiss a girl one more time; the kind of kiss that makes you feel like you're floating, the kind where you forget to do something with your hands because it's so good. I want to go camping, and lay in the grass and think how naively beautiful the day is. I want to shoot off fireworks and run away when the cops pull up. I want someone to hold my hand and tell me something nice about myself. I want to be able to read the paper and deride George W. to someone, and have them hate that asshole with me. I want to sit on a stoop late into the night, drinking shitty beer and telling stories. I want to feel alive, and not dead or dying, and think that those things - the most trivial and passing connections to the world and people in it - are violently important.

So this is my contribution to you. I'm desperately telling you - all of you- to take advantage of your youth and vitality. I hear too many people talking about college and getting shitty jobs afterward. I hear too many people talking about work and how this and that sucks. Fuck, we're all wasting our lives doing things that disconnect us from everyone else! You don't need a four or five year plan, and you sure as hell don't need to worry about feeling innocent and immature again. Worry about making everyday something to talk about, and not just another blank page in your life.

I used to act like you. I had a plan. I had a future, and all that blew away, but right now, I barely have a present, and that's how I've realized the error of our ways. Please, please, don't get old and die, and die of cancer, and realize you did nothing with your life but make plans that never happened. Don't miss opportunities anymore. If you like someone, tell them, if you think the time is right to kiss someone, do it. If you feel like you're in a rut, don something to stupid and silly and fun. If you feel the world is ugly, make something beautiful. Stop being so cautious, some movie line said : if you take life too seriously, you'll never get out alive.

Trust me, as much as life sucks sometimes, and wow, do I know it sucks, it is still the only thing we know. It is the only thing that matters, and it's wonderful. Life is a beautiful, ridiculous, tragic disaster, but it's the only thing we have. So don't let it lie by the wayside in pursuit of crap that's barely important. People are the most important resource, and so are the relationships we build with them. I feel the pinch of that more ever now. If we could spend 400 billion dollars to cure cancer instead of building and maintaining weapons, I wouldn't have to write this. So this is, essentially, a plea. This is the most personal thing I've ever written, and I hope it reaches more people than I ever could.

Don't forget this is the only life you have, make something worthwhile out of it, and no one who you've laughed, cried, kissed, and bled with will ever forget you.

In Memoriam

It is with the utmost regret that I announce the untimely death of one of our members.  On Sunday, February 15, 2004, Matt Lazzara, a private in the 104th passed away after a long battle with cancer.  Matt and his father Scott were staples at many events and had made the long trek to Gettysburg in 1998 for the 135th.  Matt was 21 years old when he succumbed.  In the few years that he was with us, he became a favorite of many of us.  He was a serious re-enactor, who had a great sense of humor and put up with razzing. To say he has been missed over the last few years is an understatement.  To say that he will be missed from now on is obvious. Our heart-felt condolences go out to his family and friends.

The following is the notice that was published in the Chicago Tribune Published February 19, 2004:

MATTHEW D. LAZZARA, 21
Matthew D. Lazzara was not only an avid fan of punk rock music but also a history buff and walking compendium of facts on the Civil War. Mr. Lazzara, 21, of Western Springs, died Sunday, Feb. 15, in his home, of cancer. ""I'd always hoped Matt would live long enough to change the world, even if it was just a little at a time,"" said his father, Scott. ""He had such a good head and heart."" Born in Hinsdale, Mr. Lazzara grew up in Western Springs and graduated from Lyons Township High School in 2000. ""He'd always been a voracious reader,"" said his father. ""His favorite subject was history and he knew so much about it."" At age 14, at the urging of one of his high school teachers, Mr. Lazzara attended his first Civil War re-enactment. He interviewed several participants and wrote a report on what he learned. ""He amazed many of the [people] he spoke with, not only because of his grasp of dates and things like that, but with his understanding of the weaponry used during the war,"" said his father. A few years later, he became a re-enactor and joined the 104th Illinois Volunteer Infantry. Mr. Lazzara was also worked as a gaffer and grip on corporate productions in which his father was involved. He also worked at a cable television station in Berwyn. He was an active volunteer for Food Not Bombs. Mr. Lazzara is also survived by his mother, Kathleen Sheridan; a brother, Michael; paternal grandparents, Samuel and Lucille; and maternal grandparents, Philip and June Sheridan. Mass will be said at 11:15 a.m. Thursday in St. John of the Cross Church, 5005 Wolf Rd., Western Springs.

Donations can be directed to the Matt Lazzara Fund through the American Cancer Society."

"event","I measure every grief...

I measure every grief I meet
With analytic eyes;
I wonder if it weighs like mine,
Or has an easier size.

I wonder if they bore it long,
Or did it just begin?
I could not tell the date of mine,
It feels so old a pain.

I wonder if it hurts to live,
And if they have to try,
And whether, could they choose between,
They would not rather die.

I wonder if when years have piled--
Some thousands--on the cause
Of early hurt, if such a lapse
Could give them any pause;

Or would they go on aching still
Through centuries above,
Enlightened to a larger pain
By contrast with the love.

The grieved are many, I am told;
The reason deeper lies,--
Death is but one and comes but once
And only nails the eyes. 

There's grief of want, and grief of cold,--
A sort they call 'despair,'
There's banishment from native eyes,
In sight of native air.

And though I may not guess the kind
Correctly yet to me
A piercing comfort it affords
In passing Calvary,

To note the fashions of the cross
Of those that stand alone
Still fascinated to presume
That some are like my own.

On a lighter note, we've been apartment hunting...man I never knew it could be so fun.  I haven't actually talked to my parents yet about it, but hopefully I can convince them to say yes.  I really need to move off the dorm and into a place where I can actually cook and watch TV.  Plus this HUGE fan under our windows whirs like a motherfucker every night and it gets soo annoying and I can't sleep.  So there are three places that are pretty sweet, Hampden for a three bedroom goes from $900 to $1500 depending on the floor we're on, but it doesn't include electricity/gas.  It's really nice though, hardwood floors for the dining room, living room and kitchen, plus the three bedrooms overlook the St Louis Cathedral and I guess that'd help push me to go to church....  And it's got a washer/dryer unit in the apartment!!  The bathrooms are very antique style, which is good and bad.  The other place is the Reserve at Central West End and it's only $925, but the third bedroom is SMALL.  I'd barely be able to fit a bed and a desk in, so that might be off.  Plus the floorplan is very linear and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to your bedroom.  The drywall is very nice though, and the bathrooms are a lot newer.  The third place is Park Royal, but they don't have a waiting list and it's more expensive, around $1600.  The place is very big though, plus it's closest to the school, AND utilities included!!  So all pending an OK mostly from my mom."

my life is extremely dull right now.  I just feel kinda fat, that's about it.  This weekend has been kinda boring too...so yah we had a big exam and I passed, that's about it.  I'm starting this wine bottle collection on my shelf next to the window, and when we walked back to residence and I looked up to my room it looked like I was a HUGE drunk or something.  I immediately closed the blinds when I got back into my room.  There was a fire alarm in the dorms yesterday but we just stayed inside and waited for it to go away heh.  Oh I'm watching Sex and the City again, from scratch (Season 1), and I'm lending out the OC season 1 like crazy.  Not sure why Arrested Development is getting on my nerves on Disc 3.  Downloaded Equilibrium, the movie with Christian Bale in it, gonna watch that soon.  I want to find the Machinist but can't find it anywhere online!  Also got this Japanese horror flick called Dark Water but no one would watch it with me.  Argh.

Oh my friends were in this swim meet (Intramurals for WashU) and they did pretty well, I had never been to a swim meet before and that was pretty sweet.

Kinda tipsy hehe."

AAAH I don't think I'd be able to afford one for a loooooooong time...maybe 10 years from now.  the S4 is even more impossible...that'll have to wait 20 years or so.  This really sucks.  I have a soft spot in my heart for convertibles...I called my dad while I was there and the connection was really bad so he thought I said I was at a Corn Show before the line cut.  Great, now the farm stereotype of St Louis will REALLY be confirmed.

Last night that club had NO air circulation whatsoever so my clothes smell like smoke and um other things.  Got it all washed, I was wearing the new BR shirt I got on Friday (it looks REALLY hot) and now it's hanging to dry after being cleaned yay!  Other parts of the night I'm gonna try and pretend it never happened heh...I hope I never run into that person again.  I wouldn't know what to say.  Yah I ran off last time I saw you.  Uh yea.  I did get a phone number from someone else more interesting though, that's pretty hot.  

Downloaded all these Two-part and three-part inventions by Bach and it's really hot.  I went to a Methodist Church too and the music thereis really cool.  Now gonna head to the art museum, which is free by the way, cool or what?  Yea feeling extremely nerdy about all this...gonn have to listen to some Gweny Gwen Gwen to make up for it.

"event","So I've been trying really hard to look for employment this summer to relieve some of this horrible debt but so far it's kinda been no luck...I mean, two profs kinda said they were interested in taking me in their lab but they were like, oh by the way get your own funding.  So I'm kind of screwed right now...dunno what to do.  I applied for this scholarship to work at NASA but I highly doubt that I'll get that, considering that I have NO background in space studies.  Sigh life sucks as a student (and then they tell me life sucks out in the real world...just great).  Darnit my sarcastic mood is building up I can feel it.

Also, American bureaucracy is about to kill me.  Everywhere in the US, you need a social security card...for credit cards, health plans, applying for coasco membership, renting cars...and if you don't have one you're screwed.  Here's the funny thing: in order for resident aliens (yea I'm an alien, yippee) to apply for a social security number I need to be employed.  Oh get this...in order to be employed outside of the school I need a social security number.  So this leads me back to research and I'm stuck there.  So basically I'm screwed. AAAH!!

Classes kinda suck too...the courses are kind of boring, except for immunology but my undergrad was immunology so it's kind of a review for me.  I feel so trapped in St Louis!!  On the happy side I've picked up swimming again so that's pretty sweet, but my friends are all sick so I've been missing that for a week or so.  It's been snowing on and off here but snow makes me happy.  My international student ID which says I'm 22 is working and I've been in clubs here in St Louis, finally!  I've been cooking a lot too, which is awesome 'cause it's really fun.  I found this really nice store called Whole Foods (and everyone here laughed at me for not knowing what it was...as well as White Castle, which actually tastes really gross unless you're drunk) and I go there just to smell the teas.  It's so nice there, and everyone working there looks so good and are so young.  Watched the beginning part of Aviator...we had to stop 'cause we were so drunk.  But it really isn't that great so far...Cate Blanchett has this ANNOYING accent, and so does DiCaprio.  It's painful to hear it.


Oh I might be going on a cruise to the Bahamas!  Actually it's only a 7 hour cruise, but then we get to spend 4 days there!  Yay I'll get a tan hopefully, that'd be sweet ass.  Darnit when is Coldplay's album coming out?"

He had me in hope for three weeks!  I feel very shitty about that.     And then there's school in general...I'm really sick of classes and having nothing to do in St Louis.  It's really not that bad; this weekend (which was a long weekend by the way) we went to see Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (which turned out to be not too bad, although it was hilarious to hear the actors slip on their lines and to hear local accents, e.g. saying ""killin'"" instead of ""killing""), and then we drank like mad and watched Harold+Kumar Go To White Castle and then went to White Castle ourselves, went snowboarding on this dingy hill that was so icy i slipped and gave myself a mild concussion, played LAN games and cooked dinner for ourselves.  It was really fun, but I'm still depressed.  I think I really want to meet someone but I feel like it's impossible to do it at med school and I dunno how to get over this feeling.  Kinda just want to hide from everything.  It's even more depressing since my two friends here in st Louis just broke up last night and it's all mad chaos with me stuck in the middle.  I dunno what to do about everything!  I have no idea what to do with my M.D. either.  Just EVERYTHING's up in the air and I can't really deal with it all.

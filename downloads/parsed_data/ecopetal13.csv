"event","on wednesday i had english with him and he laughed at things i said so i guess that he wasn't mad. then at lunch i left the table i was sitting at for a moment and went over to a table close to his to ask someone a question and i say him getting upand walk over to my table at the seat right next to the one i had just occupied so i finished up at the other table and walked back to mine trying to look like i hadn't even notice. but the first thing i did notice was that he haden't even talked to anyone yet but the moment i sat down he started talking to me. then when i said to him ' can you smell josh right now [he was sitting next to josh] cause he smells so bad' and he turns his head and sniffs the air around josh and then he scoots more toward me and i laugh and i am like' he doesn't shower or like wear deoderentand he took alonger slide toward me.lol.i think about that right now and i think that he must be one of those boys who like showers regurally and were deoderant every day and that is definitly a turn on.lol. and then i think of him showering and taking off his shirt to put on deoderent!lol just kidding lol.so yeah and then i head to social studies after lunch and nicole says to me 'rachel asked tyler if he liked you today in science adn he was like yeah' and i was like'omg you probably embarassed him' lol and then rachel comes and she is like 'guess what he likes you' and i was like 'i know i already knew that and nicole said you asked him' like omg everyone is getting involved with this whole thing! everyone is trying to hook us up and find out who likes who adni am like OMG! but at the same time i am like, proceed please you are feeding me info and helping me flirt but whatever what will come will come.lol.!!!"

"event","Jenny was so happy about the house they had found. For once in her life 'twas on the right side of town. She unpacked her things with such great ease. As she watched her new curtains blow in the breeze. How wonderful it was to have her own room. School would be starting; she'd have friends over soon. There'd be sleep-overs, and parties; she was so happy It's just the way she wanted her life to be. On the first day of school, everything went great. She made new friends and even got a date! She thought, ""I want to be popular and I'm going to be, Because I just got a date with the star of the team!"" To be known in this school you had to have clout, And dating this guy would sure help her out. There was only one problem stopping her fate. Her parents had said she was too young to date. ""Well I just won't tell them the entire truth. They won't know the difference; what's there to lose?"" Jenny asked to stay with her friends that night. Her parents frowned but said, ""All right."" Excited, she got ready for the big event But as she rushed around like she had no sense, She began to feel guilty about all the lies, But what's a pizza, a party, and a moonlight ride? Well the pizza was good, and the party was great, But the moonlight ride would have to wait. For Dan was half drunk by this time. But he kissed her and said that he was just fine. Then the room filled with smoked and Dan took a puff. Jenny couldn't believe he was smoking that stuff. Now Dan was ready to ride to the point But only after he'd smoked another joint. They jumped in the car for the moonlight ride, Not thinking that he was too drunk to drive. They finally made it to the point at last, And Dan started trying to make a pass. A pass is not what Jenny wanted at all (and by a pass, I don't mean playing football.) ""Perhaps my parents were right....maybe I am too young. Boy, how could I ever, ever be so dumb."" With all of her might, she pushed Dan away: ""Please take me home, I don't want to stay."" Dan cranked up the engine and floored the gas. In a matter of seconds they were going too fast. As Dan drove on in a fit of wild anger, Jenny knew that her life was in danger. She begged and pleaded for him to slow down, But he just got faster as they neared the town. ""Just let me get home! I'll confess that I lied. I really went out for a moonlight ride."" Then all of a sudden, she saw a big flash. ""Oh God, Please help us! We're going to crash!"" She doesn't remember the force of impact. Just that everything all of a sudden went black. She felt someone remove her from the twisted rubble, And heard, ""call an ambulance! These kids are in trouble! Voices she heard...a few words at best. But she knew there were two cars involved in the wreck. Then wondered to herself if Dan was all right, And if the people in the other car was alive. She awoke in the hospital to faces so sad. ""You've been in a wreck and it looks pretty bad."" These voices echoed inside her head, As they gently told her that Dan was dead. They said ""Jenny, we've done all we can do. But it looks as if we'll lose you too."" ""But the people in the other car!?"" Jenny cried. ""We're sorry, Jenny, they also died."" Jenny prayed, ""God, forgive me for what I've done I only wanted to have just one night of fun."" ""Tell those people's family, I've made their lives dim, And wish I could return their families to them."" ""Tell Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied, And that it's my fault so many have died. Oh, nurse, won't you please tell them that for me?"" The nurse just stood there-she never agreed. But took Jenny's hand with tears in her eyes. And a few moments later Jenny died. A man asked the nurse, ""Why didn't you do your best To bid that girl her one last request?"" She looked at the man with eyes so sad. ""Because the people in the other car were her mom and dad."" This story is sad and unpleasant but true, So young people take heed, it could have been you.


READ AND PASS ON TO AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE

Please listen to this angel's request...... 

If you do the small favor she asks to come true, She will be sent down to guard and protect you. 

Please....do it for Jenny. 

Send ten copies and see what happens in four days. You will get a surprise. This is true, even if you are not superstitious. 

Good luck, but please remember: 10 copies of this message must leave your hands in 24 hours................................."

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG><FONT size=2><FONT color=#ff0000 size=7>A </FONT>few years ago a mother and a father decided they needed a break, so they wanted to head out for a night on the town. So they called their most trusted babysitter. When the babysitter arrived the two children were already fast asleep in bed. So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later in the night, the babysitter got bored and so she wanted to watch tv but she couldnt watch it downstairs because they didnt have cable downstairs (the parents didnt want their children watching too much garbage) so she called them and asked them if she could watch cable tv in the parents room. Of course the parents said it was ok, but the babysitter had one final request. She asked if she could cover up the large clown statue in their bedroom with a blanket or cloth, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father(who was talking to the babysitter at the time) said.....take the children and get out of the house.....we'll call the police...we dont have a clown statue..... the children and the babysitter got murdered by the clown. it turned out 2 be that the clown was a killer that escaped from jail. if you dont repost this within 5 minutes the clown will be standing next 2 your bed at 3:00am with a knife in his hand</FONT></STRONG> </FONT></P>"

"event","ok the first memorie i have of this summer is...MY SISTERS PARTY!!!
so let me start by saying that it was on the 24th of june at my fathers house in westport mass.(about a half hour away from middletown). and this year my sister said i could come!!! not that i don't come every other year it has happened but it is just an entirely different feeling when it is the person having the party who invites you and not yourself!lol! but anyway her party is know around westprot for being the most bad ass party of the year. why you ask? wellto start every year she has a band or at the least a DJ and the music is always bangin,(!) then theres the fact that our dad who is 100% irish has NO problem with serveing alcohol to anyone (minors and myself inculded)so he gets a 60 pack or a keg or two every year(well really not until my sis was 18 but it was always there anyway)then there is the small bond fire in our backyard , the hot tube that usually opens very early in theparty thanx to alcohol, then there is the pool table and final the fact that about 60-100 people come every year. not to mention that one of our neighbors always calls the cops(usually because of the noise)but we alway get away with it cause my dad is like freinds with a popular cop with our last name lol. so i have a milloin details that i will reveal all in good time aka tomarrow im tired.!"

"event","tomorrow i'm off the hook and finally free from my mothers grip.if you didn't know i was grounded for fucking ""bad"" behavior:(.well what ever any way if you didn't know alica periera gave henry miller a bad grade in tec-ed for making a crappy bracelet(out of plastic and he is usually pretty good.) and so he said ""lets see you make a good bracelet "" so she tried and sucked and so henry and rob  were like ""your worse at it than i am"" and she got wicked pissed and she punched henry in the spine. so then mr. conca fond out and henry was wicked pissed and alica got busted and they told her to go to mrs. mccarthy's office and she stormed out and went to sit in the hallway and came back in sobbing so that mr. conca would feel BAD for her and sure enough after crying her eyes out she avoided trouble. i don't know about everone else in this school but alica periera bugs the crap out of me."

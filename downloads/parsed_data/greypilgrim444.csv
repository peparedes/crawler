assuming i make it in the new year, i'd like to see the following developments and reforms:
-in the year 2006, any two people who have the same computer password must be married regardless of age, sex, race, or creed. 
-in the year 2006, the sign of success will be autographed sports memorabilia mounted to walls.
-in the year 2006, more people will use conditioner in their hair and semi-colons in their sentences.
-in the year 2006, Apple will invent a flying car that is compatible with EVERYTHING.
-in the year 2006, Jerome Bettis will teach me how to bowl, and then drive me home in his flying bus.
-in the year 2006, Billy Joel will crash into a 707 that is parked on the runway.
-in the year 2006, the trees will attack and it will be the vegans who are the first to go.
-in the year 2006, FOX will bring back Celebrity Boxing, but with only half the original writers, and subsequently, only half the original brilliance.
-in the year 2006, Ohio will be sold to China for $2,400.
-in the year 2006, The world will continue to deny Bob Costas his big break.
-in the year 2006, toilet paper corseness will be regulated by the government.

"event","connor and dan came over to watch the game, fix christmas tree lights, bake a ham, and build a fire in the fireplace.  during half time we went outside and played with my BB gun.

the president of cwru came by for dinner tonight.  i meant to tell him ""case sucks! cmu! cmu! cmu!"" but forgot.  hopefully the tree, ham and fire said it all.  

he asked me how his friend jerry cohen was doing and i told him about the porn.  then i told him about the natrat.  maybe if the steelers had scored another touchdown i'd have felt secure enough to revisit the shabazz story.   alas, pride in robots, drama, and 41 points can only go so far in countering the shame of collegiate controversy.  i'll just have to wait until easter dinner before taking racial-hate-speech out of my backstock.  by then it should be a prime conversation piece.   assuming the steelers made the playoffs.  and there hasn't been a new new-black-panthers-party-esque episode to make us forget our shameful, pornographic, short-term past.  

i don't like being bad at thinking.  specifically, i hate being inarticulate.  i vaguely remember feeling sharper when i first gave up alcohol.  now, not so sharp.  while i've been able to think, i haven't had any command of language.  i'm going to assume my diction has been weakened by a lack of sleep, nutrition, and exposure to stimulation and challenge.  i don't know.  words just aren't coming to me.  and when they are, they're usually too stupid to use.  

if i hadn't always been impractical, this hyper-critical anxiety blocking my cognitive abilities would really worry me.  i used to be all about the impractical negligence of logistics.  it was kind of nice.  dreaming, floating, drifting along.  but somewhere down the line that ended.  now i'm objectively detached to the point of not being able to function.  maybe i've become a cynic, but i don't care for that term.  it's too often used by those who need to label things for their own security.  furthermore, in cynicism hope has been lost.  while i haven't necessarily found hope in my state of not-cynicism, i'm still looking everywhere i go.  which brings me to my next point.  santa is dead.  get over it.  i still need to wrap presents for my family and stick them under the tree.   

sometimes i wonder if perhaps i'm just really slow.  maybe everyone else already realized the arbitrary nature of identity a long time ago.  and maybe they did the math and figured out that it was indeed better to sacrifice objectivity and reason, than to live in a state of existential paralysis.  it's all possible.  probably wasn't that climactic.  everyone just said yes, it's all pretty random what we do with our lives, but worrying about it isn't worth the time or energy when we have a functional system.  i guess that works.  i just have trouble committing to a practical character.  i can't forget that every guiding principle i have has been randomly inherited and is no more valid than any other.  

i'm not sure what's easier and more cowardly: acting or thinking.  in either case i need to stop being a douchebag.  i need to get some passion and rock n roll back into me.  make a few emotional investments.  stop devolving into shy, awkwardness.  go on world tour.  wrap presents and put them under the tree.  

etc!"

it's really just an inability to breathe right.  this past week i haven't been able to concentrate on the breath.  this of course has made it difficult to concentrate on the present moment.  i try to focus on just breathing, on just letting things pass, but it's tough when every single stimuli makes me tense-up in some obsessive anticipation of hyper-analysis.  so i have this tense body, and this active mind, and neither are allowing me to regulate my being into a state of peace because i can't just breathe.  i can't just let things around me go.  i can't even believe what have been my few constant truths in life, that peace isn't planned out but lived one moment at a time, that all things pass, and that past and future failures and achievements must be released.  i haven't been able to believe these things on two levels.  the anxiety ridden level where paranoia seems to have subplanted my common sense as of a week ago.  and my philosophical level, where i'm not feeling right 'letting go' and 'experiencing just the moment' in the midst of this suffering world.  

i know my inability to sleep well at night isn't helping to end world hunger.  but somewhere back there i just lost the stomach for indifference, knowing how much my personal comfort costs the world.  i'd love to find a way to sleep at night and help others by day.  but a part of me distrusts that solution simply because it's rational, and rationalization and justification are scary things.  

meh.  i have much more to say. many more theories and feelings i can propose and debunk.  not tonight.  

i'll end by saying that we all went bowling tonight, and after two terrible games, i finally had a good experience controlling my body and mind.  i did everything i could to simply let go of the game, the numbers, the score, the place, the people, the sounds, the lights and just focus on knocking down the pins when it was my turn.  before rolling i concentrated on my breath and took an inventory of my body, the weight and texture of the ball, and the moment in general.  then i rolled.  and when it was over, it was over.  

it's all very zen, bowling.  as many times as i knock them down, they'll be back up.  there will always be more frames and always too many pins for me to knock over.  it's just about concentrating on the 10 i'm given at a time, enjoying the process of trying to complete my task, and letting go of the outcome when its over.  it's just like RENT taught me: no frame but this frame."

you know the spyware we were talking about, that makes every search turn up porn on my downloading program?

MATT
uh huh

TIM
i'm always amused by some of the titles

TIM
'One armed man gets dominated in sex'

TIM
'Precious little twink getting it in the ass'

MATT
that first one sounds hot

TIM
'hot young twinks giving hand to a bear'

TIM
'young studs fucking each other while high on GHB'

TIM
what's GHB?

MATT
Gamma hydroxibutyrate

TIM
what's that?

MATT
put simply? It's a date rape drug

TIM
how do you know all this?

MATT
ER experience

TIM
uh huh

TIM
'19 year old does (she says) her first porn scene and fucks two guys'

TIM
i like how they're not convinced it's her first

MATT
I wouldn't be

TIM
'i videotaped my girlfriend giving me a blowjob and she dumped me so fuck her its on the internet now'

TIM
i can respect that

MATT
yeah, so can I

TIM
'pussy getss corndog put in it AND STICKS'

TIM
they're really excited about that last part

MATT
wouldn't you be?

TIM
'virgin gets her cherry popped--you can tell because she bleeds a tiny bit and you can see it hurts'

TIM
what the hells hot about that run on sentence?

MATT
because it would suggest she's virginal

TIM
'i taped my bf masturbating and he dumped me so you can watch him LOSER'

TIM
not as good as the other one

MATT
nope

MATT
not even close

TIM
probably because it's from the woman's point of view

TIM
and women suck

MATT
I like them more when they suck

MATT
we probably have enough throws to make a really cool fort

TIM
the coolest fort ever?

MATT
don't push your luck

TIM
i'd kinda like to make it in the bedroom and annex the closet and possibly the crapper

MATT
could we annex phil's room?

MATT
and set up a colony

TIM
yes

MATT
and communicate between the two using two cups and string

TIM
but first we get the toilet

TIM
that's priority

MATT
ok

TIM
this convo is blog worthy

MATT
yeah? Going all the way back to the fort?

MATT
or just the porn?

TIM
the porn, then the fort

MATT
the ol' switcheroo

TIM
Live at Leeds style

MATT
man I love that album







BONUS CONVERSATION FROM EARLIER THAT DAY:

TIM
so i typed in 'Wrath of Khan, french' into my downloading program and got 'french solo victoria spreads her legs wide and invites you in (wrath of khan, french)' as a result.

TIM
should i just settle for that?

MATT
well you see

MATT
people have designed software

MATT
usually spyware

MATT
to pop up no matter what the search is

TIM
that will automatically contain the text of your search in the file name

MATT
right

TIM
yeah yeah

TIM
i know she's not french

TIM
but i can pretend

MATT
uh huh"

If Matt and I weren't going to die terribly young (and poor and forgotten), we'd probably be that neighbor someday.  by then, we'd also be married and truly accepted for our lifestyle choices.

while you might think all of this and the Depend's (TM) are just as easily available at any State University of New York, dig this: the old folks also have wifi.  

sometimes i wish i were old.  for a while i didn't feel like i was very good at being young.  then one day i was.  recently, i've been fantasizing about spending time with people and books i love.  quietly.  without a need to see things burn or suffer.  that's not to say i'm ready to play the game.  i just don't feel like spending my energy on stealing traffic cones when i could be having soup.  

i saw a little old lady writing up the weekend events on a dry erase board in the lobby tonight.  when i'm old, i wonder if i'll still ask myself what dirty words i could make with the addition or subtraction of single letters.  i hope so/not.  i don't know at this point, really.   how horribly safe being sure of things like that will be.

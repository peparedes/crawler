NO CAFFEINE FOR THE OPTI!<br />Book of the Week: Queens.org - Not a book but it's what I've been reading lately<br />LOL Cat of the Day:&nbsp;<a href=""http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/lolnominee-vicki-webby.jpg?w=400&amp;h=544"">http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/lolnominee-vicki-webby.jpg?w=400&amp;h=544</a><br /><wbr></wbr><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""1st Week of Work - Can Haz Hold Button Plz"">Well. I finished my first week of work, and it went relatively well. I work at a medical referal line call center, so I get to learn all sorts of new and interesting words like 'urogynocology'. And all sorts of juicy little facts like you can get reconstructive surgery anywhere. And I mean...<em>anywhere.</em>&nbsp;Also? The hold button is freakin' awesome and apparently&nbsp; my voice is soothing?&nbsp;In any event, I finished up my week, looking forward to the next. It's just nice to have something to do during the days, instead of staying at home all day, taking medication and forgetting to record/write down if I have anymore attacks.<br /><br />For people who don't know? I have seizures now. Yep that's right. Usually only during the night/very early morning and it's all due to a vaccination that was given to me without my consent. Now I have an unexplainable neurological condition that can at the most extreme, make me black out. - Trust me. That's not pleasant. Not in the least. But I'm getting better slowly. We're taking a less conventional route, herbal remedies and therapies and the like. I also cannot have any stimulants so...no caffeine or sugar and I'm supposed to have as little stress as possible. To avoid triggering something accidentally.<br /><br />Oh yes, happy happy joy joy. I have to take about... 12 different things in a day. I guess you could call them medications, their just called this really complicated thing like nutraseutical or...something like that. I also have to wear a Gluthathione patch, and it helps in another way as well.<br /><br />So...time sheet faxed in, work week finished, only 2 'major' attacks from Mon to Today and due to easy fatigue having to go to sleep between 7:45-8:30. Life has changed quite a bit. But atleast I'm getting paid!</div><br />"

"event","So I'm working on college...yes. Assignments. Not very happy here with my leg feeling weird, but no hospital cuz whee, no constant pain. I'll see what happens when my dad comes up. I'm worried cuz we have stairs...and I'm not looking to fall down any stairs yo. That would huuuuuurt. I'm practicing a song as well for Sim Idol and I reeeeeeally hate Beyonce right now. Lisssssten, good gracious. SHH, Shuts up! And I'm rambling cuz I feel just so murky...

Anyhow, my mother is pushing more water at me and these questions aren't going to answer themselves. Just an update. No hospital, but no badly injuring myself further.

There's a gecko in my house
Awfully glad it's not a mouse
Even though it makes me scream and shout
I wouldn't want to put it out.
Becaaaaauuuuuse

There are mosquitos in my home
Downstairs they freely roam
And they little buggers like to bite me
Apparently I have sweet meat
Buuuuuuuuuttt

The gecko he does eat them
And so I'm here to sing his anthem
ROCK ON LITTLE FREAKY THIIIIIIIING!

I am living in hawaii now, a place that's hot and moist
My room is the amazon rain forest, but that...is not by my choice
My room has just one window, and is the size of a postage stamp
And it stays humid in there without the AC, even though I run a fan!

College is almost over, and I'll have my AD (July!)
Hopefully in the fall, I can hit NZ (I'll fly!)
I used to love computers, but after these two years
I've got VBS TD TCP/IP coming out of my ears!

I hope you loved this update, it's really really late
I'm so ready to move out, I'm sure many can relate!"

"event","Today I'm feeling : Crampy

Lols received today: None

Books I'm Reading: CCNA Guide to Cisco Networking

Coffees:  0

Chatting with: Random People

~*~*~*

Let it first be clear, that I hold no grudges against the beautiful entity that is, Cyberspace. I am a citizen in this virtual world, well known in some aspects, feared in others. I am not a snob, but I am a person who is mildly offended when the lovely English language is butchered.

Chatspeak, it kills baby faries.

I understand some people are lazy, but is it too much to ask for a person type as if they have atleast an Elementary level grammar education? I admit, I am not perfect and typos do happen but there is truely no excuse to type like I shall type in the following examples.

Example Number 1:

yO waZzup, you iz a crAzY ho LoL

Why this is wrong:

First off, being called a ho is not amusing at all, whether you know the person or not. Secondly...if you do not know how to use the shift key properly, don't use it. 

Example Number 2:

than I wis lyke, thets gr8t and the sayd I shuld go

Why this is wrong:

First off, if you do not know how to spell...there are sites like dictionary.com and most computers have a dictionary on them somewhere. If you are unable to use any of these very helpful writing tools...then atleast invest in a good spell checker, or avoid sites where you will be mocked. The only way you are excused for such things, is if you are 12 or younger. 

Example number 3:

*profanity that I can not be bothered to type out* *crude and lame description of sexual fantasies* *excessive angst*

Why this is wrong:

Perhaps it is not wrong, but it annoys me. Alot. I personally don't want to know if you want to fornicate with Jennifer Lopez, and I know life can, to be crassly juvenile here, I know life can 'suck' just give a warning so that people who are also being sucked by life and do not care to read such things can scamper off to read of lollipops...or whatever.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically, online and in person I have a low tolerance of being grammatically lazy just because a person can. Again, I am not judging anybody, but I do prefer to talk to people online who atleast *look* literate. If they type like a 9 year old who is dyslexic, I am not one to judge but I do not have much time to dedicate to translating their text. So, it is not personal...and I'm sure I'm not the only person with this tiny online pet peeve.

There, this is your Cyberspace post for the week. Tune in next week when I find something else that rubs me the wrong way.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are some of <i>your</i> chat speak pet peeves?"

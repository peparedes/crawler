"event","good grief, shame on me....I have become the worst LJ poster I know!! It has been so long since I last posted I can't think where to start!! Well...Gastro-enteritis has been a close friend of mine..., working like a dog, college, course work and revision, more work......more work than that....doing six or seven days a week at the moment...most tiring it is....what comes next.....CRD got 'flu, CRD has given 'flu to me....which also means bronchitis (couugh couuuuugh)...trip to vets yesterday with Ben (one of CRDs Guinea Pigs) he was really poorly--had pneumonia--apparently most likely a secondry(sp?) infection of him catching OUR 'flu...had to have him put to sleep...I sobbed like a baby. Poor little mite. Bill the other one is now on major antibiotics everyday (ever medicated a guinea pig....not fun!!) to make sure he stays well!!!! So...that's about me upto date I think... missing my online family and my special friend Shane on here...haven't chatted with him for ages and have lost his email address!!! Anyway I am alive and half-well for any of you getting restless about my lack of contact. I'll try a little harder to post sooner.. Much Love to all my family and friends-miss y'all xxx"

"event","I cannot believe that it is a week today...nope, yesterday in fact since I last updated my journal! How bad is that? Have no mitigating circumstances either....well I have been working my tail off this week(at work, obviously) lots of late nights etc etc.. hey that could almost sound like fun...after all my boss is a bit of a cutie. Loads of college work too...but other than those...I have no real excuse. Had a pre-bonfire night type firework party thing tonight, lots and lots of pretty colours...it was wonderful. Until the big firework decided to go wrong and came hurtling at me at a million miles an hour!!!! Ever played football with a ball of fire???? So yeah, that kinda put a damper on things...but all in all it was a good night. Anyway--bedtime--busy day tomorrow!"

"event","Hmmm..what to say? Who knows.. sometimes life is very peculiar. Went out with the girls on Saturday night (that being the 19th and the 6 year anniversary of my Dad's death) and couldn't get drunk for the life of me... one of my best mates from school came too; first time I have seen her in ten years...and though we have both changed dramatically--basically on the inside where it counts we have stayed the same. It was really nice to see her. She did however get extremely drunk--and had me in stitches...never seen her drunk before. So...a thoroughly good if somewhat bizarre night. Had a brief sob about my Dad...which I never understand...the man was a total bastard..and a complete f***ed up Puppy....but I miss him so much. Anyway...much homework awaits me for my Psych course..must pull my finger out and get on with it."

"event","Another day another diary....or something. Well, what can I say today.....not a lot really...had an interesting offer of being chained up and used for riotous sex today...turned it down, as you do. Well as I do anyway. I'm a good girl. 
Have to work tomorrow so have to have a reasonably sensible night tonight, don't know what's wrong with me....turning down bondage offers...trying to make a go of a job...mayhap I am growing up? Damn, Bloody hope not! Just a mental abberation perhaps? 
Wonder how many spelling mistakes I make in these postings....have noticed one or two I think. Maybe I should ask Santa for a dictionary for christmas. Or maybe I should just run the spell checker?? Interesting thought, must investigate further."

"event","Hmmmm me not doing so well at this keeping up my journal thing....my bad-smack hand. Very hectic weekend just gone...too drunk and other STUFF to even find my pc..let alone type a sentient message. This is a best attempt completely sober....so imagine the mess I would make if I wasn't! Started a new job today--hoorah for me--passed a Psych exam, top of the class, hoorah for me again...ok..well I have come on here, made excuses, bragged a little, must be time to leave again! Some of us have to WORK you know..heeheehee"

"event","Well I lasted a long time didn't I....just popped into a yahoo chat room, as is my want ..and found that yes, all my suspicions were well founded, chat and the world in general is full of pretentious a***-holes. Sometimes people piss me off. Really piss me off. Would like to do that squishy head thing and eliminate some of them. 
Had a dream last night....had everyone I have ever dated in it...guest starring in the head of me. Most of them were A-holes too. Not entirely sure what the meaning of the dream was...perhaps being a super-psychology student now I should try some of Freuds' free association dream analysis. Or maybe not....I'd end up twice as screwed up and even more bitter and twisted probably. But still adorable I assume..??? Ha ha."

"event","Babies...
A special friend of mine just had a baby (well his partner did all the work...actually I presume he helped in the very formative creation.. but you know.......they had a baby) and he mailed me a picture of the tiny little angel his daughter, for the first time in who knows how long I just looked at a baby and though 'yeah I could do that again' so contrary to what I like to believe I do have some maternal instincts... The Bitch does get broody after all.
 Anyway, over that now...mouth less sore today..brain less dead also..2 hours of Statistics does that for you...actually no...I got that back to front.....too many late nights just recently and I have a job interview tomorrow..so a very short post today....need my sleepie-times."

"event","Well, I've just downloaded a new program supposedly to help make this journal game a little bit easier...and now I feel really blonde.....can't work out how to use this little box thing..is it safe? Will it break me? Will it even friggin' work. Why have I no friends on my lists? Are there any answers to my questions?"

"event","Trying to learn my way round this site...I lost my bio somewhere between typing it and getting to this page...I am bio-less :( Had to post something...the UK escapee sibling of mine must have checked here a million zillion times (I exaggerate not)last night and promptly moaned when there was nothing for him to pick over and criticise! Love ya bro.
Had a wisdom tooth out today...hence the subject title for this post...that makes 3 gone now...so what level of wisdom does that leave me with? Considering the person I am, can I afford to have lost the amount I lost with the previous 3 extractions??? Anyway...sense of humour failure now..pain of this sort doesn't work for me...this'll do for a start and maybe by my next post I will have worked out how to get pretty pages like the rest of you have..or a bio...maybe not though...don't hold your breath."

My life is pretty full these days, if you talk to me on a regular basis you probably know this, but I haven't been doing the big exciting trips as much lately, and really, that was mostly what I posted here about.

Mostly migrated with the hordes to Facebook, but as always, email is the best way to get a hold of me.

"event","Saturday October 24th - My last full day in Nawlins. Took a walk in the morning around the neighborhood. The sun was out so I got a bunch more pictures of ironwork and neat doors. I have no idea what I am going to DO with all the photos if even 1/2 of them come out! Hopefully at least one photo of the tree across the way which is COVERED in Mardi Gras Beads turned out. I was having trouble having them show up in the pictures. 

After lunch Jess and I took a walk to the 1st Annual Magazine Street Blues Festival. :) Tiny little thing, but it was fun. We shared a cup of tasty tomato basil soup and a redfish and black bean taco, wandered through the few booths, then headed up Magazine Street. Magazine street is pretty much at that point a bunch of small shops, mostly antiques, but a few fun ones to wander in. One fun thing was we saw a random band playing on the porch of a clothing store. They weren't bad either. :) We successfully made it down to the Buffalo Exchange, though it was really crowded and neither of us found anything we couldn't live without. We were less successful finding a particular (or any) ice cream shop on the way back. Oh well.

Around 7:30 all three of us headed into the CBD Central Business DIstrict) to try and catch the Krewe du Boo Parade [http://holiday-entertaining.suite101.com/article.cfm/new_orleans_halloween_parade]. We ended up getting stopped in the car less than one block from the end of the route, so we parked the car (no one was going anywhere, we were at 2 one ways, both blocked in the ""out"" direction) and walked the block over to catch the rest of the parade. We saw almost all of it and the floats were totally fun. They also threw (and I mean lobbed them at you, watch your head style) beads and cups and other plastic crap. Since we were at the end, they threw lots of stuff. I am heading home with a good bunch of Mardi Gras beads to share around. It was fun and the music was wonderful.

Once the parade was done, we were able to move the car and went into the French Quarter to catch dinner at the Gumbo Shop [http://www.gumboshop.com/]. I had the Chicken Andouille Gumbo to start, I don't usually like Gumbo, since I don't usually like Okra, this one was really good, and the Okra wasn't either overwhelming or slimy.

For main I had a combination platter with Shrimp Creole (mmmm yum) Red Beans and Rice (very different from the previous one, but still tasty, more plain) and Crawfish Etouffee (which was not to my taste) It had almost a sweetness to it I didn't really feel for after all the semi spicy creole food I had been having. Maybe it was just that day, I don't know.

Then Joel and I split a bread pudding with Whiskey sauce (that was fantastic) for desert. 

It was a nice ending note for my food in New Orleans. 



Sunday October 25th was drive to Austin Texas day. Nothing much to say. Mostly flat. There was this insanely long (25 or 30 miles?) Causeway/raised road/bridge over the swamps out of New Orleans. There was a neat ""swamp tour"" boardwalk thing at the Texas welcome center. Though I didn't see the rumored alligator, there were cute turtles. Also very cool clouds over Houston. Maybe some of the pictures turned out.

Arrived in Austin around 6pm. Settled in with one of my CS hosts and talked for a while about travel, then went and got a sandwich at Thunder Subs. I got a Vegie Delight with Cheese and Roast beef. Totally huge and messy and great. Whole wheat sub, with avocado and Hummus, lettuce, sprouts, cucumber, mushrooms, olives, tomato and provolone and Roast beef. :) The sandwich guy gave me a kind of funny look when I asked for the RB on it, but made it for me anyway. Went after to a local Pub called The Draft House to get a beer. I didn't like any of the beers THEY made, but I ended up with a Texas made Pecan Porter by (512). It was delish. More talking about travel. They (my hosts) couchsurfed around Turkey earlier this year, and I am interested in how well it works overseas. Apparently well. Camille got off work around 9:30, and we all three talked for a long while, some of it outside enjoying the almost perfect weather at a local coffee shop. Totally awesome people.  



Monday October 26th. Woke up to pouring rain. Today's plans for walking to the museum and around downtown will just have to be adjusted. Took a rain and thrift day. If you like to thrift, and you are ever in Austin, TX check out the Goodwill Blue Hanger stores. Outlet stores, with clothing in bins, $1.25 each piece. Takes a bit to sort through things, but I got lots of fun stuff. 

Dinner was Texas Barbecue at Ruby's Barbecue! I got beef brisket with delicious barbecue sauce and a mustard potato salad (that kind of tasted like deviled eggs) and a vinaigrette coleslaw that I loved. Thanks Camille for the suggestion! Camille and William got Elgin sausage and let me try some. It was also very delicious, though not spicy though it was billed that way. Desert was Amy's Ice cream. Camille got a delicious pumpkin that I was very tempted by, but I ended up with the ""shiner"" (beer) one and a Kahlua/porter one.



Tuesday October 27th

Walked downtown to the Texas Museum. Wandered through the exhibits for about an hour, pretty interesting actually, then caught a show about Texas Weather that was fun. Then walked all the way downtown to 6th street, stopping in a few interesting shops, turned around, and walked back to the house, total walked was about 5 miles. Wheeee.

In the evening my hosts had a few friends of theirs join us for a wonderful Pumpkin carving party. Another CS'er who I had been talking to online joined us, and good food (sausages, chicken, and Turkish meatballs) and good beer was had by most.I picked up a few 6 packs of local beer at the grocery store when we went to get the pumpkins. 3 or each pack are going home with me to share around. Hopefully one of the photos of the carved pumpkins will turn out.



Wednesday October 28th. Drove to Silver City, NM. 13.5 hrs total on the road. 3 short breaks.  Lots of open, boring space. Some neat weather over Houston, photos might have turned out. Nothing much else of note. Arrived In SC in time to eat dinner with my host. We went to a local brewing company and split a small pizza, as well as each had a frosty mug of their home brewed root beer. :) Hanging out and talking, then sleep. Oh, just a note, it was realllly cold once I got to New Mexico, apparently it had been snowing on and off all day.



Thursday October 29th. Silver City, NM. Woke up lateish (8am) thanks to a host who works downstairs of where she lives, so she could come back up to lock up when I finally made it out. :) Then after dressing in layers, I packed my stuff back in the car and walked downtown (1.5 blocks to main street) to explore. Wandered into and out of pretty much every open store on Main in an effort to stay warm. Couldn't resist a adorable sculpture made out of a old GMC truck hood and a packet of 5 old Harlequins for $.25. Had a fantastic lunch at Vicki's Eatery. Started with a mug of homemade hot apple cider. Then had a cup of the homemade chicken noodle soup (lots of chicken and broad noodles), and a grilled Havarti cheese sandwich on sourdough with grilled tomato added in. Totally delish and hit the spot. After lunch I discovered the small gallery area in downtown, and wandered in and out of galleries. Around 3, pretty much frozen solid. (it was in the High 20's, low 30's, with a nasty wind) I took my computer into a nearby coffee house that had free wifi. With a hot Chai in me I found a place to stay that night in Phoenix, (Thank you Q-Street) and headed out of town early. Brrrr.

5 hr drive to Phoenix. Some pretty sky shots, I hope they come out, a incredible long sunset (Driving west!) and not much else. It was dark for over 1/2 of the drive. Arrived, was fed dinner of beans, rice and baked pumpkin w/apple. Good. Tired. Bed on a comfy futon. 



Friday next time."

"event","Woke this morning with my legs still sore, not sure how much walking I will do. The Sun however just stuck it's head out.. I may have to take the camera out, regardless. Most of my shots so far have been under cloudy skies. Tasty Honeycrisp Apple for breakfast. 

Decided to stay in and play with the computer in favor of sore legs and realizing 1, I was planing to walk several miles in the afternoon, and 2 I still hadn't heard back from my next stop, (Austin, TX) on whether I had a place to stay!

After noon Jess got home, then we all mustered out of the house to head to the French quarter. Wandering through shops filled with all kind of odds and ends ensued. Watched Joel try on a multitude of different hats, but none that were perfect. Oh well. I picked up 2 presents for others and a pretty rhinestone fleur-de-lis necklace for me. I am wearing it now and it makes me happy. I saw another set of purple and green (Mardi gras colors) that I am still thinking of, and possibly a painting that is stuck in my head. You know when you see something, and think.. wow, I really want to own that.. Well I probably won't go back and get either of them, but we will see. I only have tomorrow before I head out. J&J indulged me and we stopped at Cafe Du Monde and I got a Cafe o'lait and the Beignets. Oh my goodness was there a lot of powdered sugar! Totally fun to eat, and actually pretty tasty for fried dough. I couldn't really taste the difference that the ""chicory"" made in the coffee. It just tasted like somewhat bitter coffee to me. I was hoping for a distinct flavor. Oh well. Now at least I can say I did it, and I even have a picture to prove it thanks to Jess.

After coffee we took a walk along the river up to canal street, then wandered back to the car via Royal Avenue, again stopping in a few neat shops. 3 miles+ total walked. Such a fun experience. 

Now checking email and things to do in Austin before going to bed. It's actually turning into an early night somehow. And yes, I did hear back from Austin! Place to stay confirmed.

Talk to you all again soon!

"event","So before I get into Boston and the wonderful week that was, I have to tell you of a tragedy. 

My beloved little olympus digital camera has died. It not longer is able to judge exposure and over exposes everything, and there is no way I have found to fix or compensate for it. In light of this, after much angst and trial and error to get it to work, I have purchased a new camera. No pictures attached to this post, though in a few days I might get them up on Facebook. And possibly none for a while as I get used to the new camera. Bah.

------------

Arrived in the Boston area latish Thursday night, in time to pick Theresa up from work at the flying trapeze rig in Reading, MA. It is INSIDE a ""Joardan's Furniture"" along with a water/light show, Imax movie theater, RIchardson's ice cream and candy shop. Even though I didn't fly this trip, still not sure of the health of my shoulder, it is tons of fun to watch other people fly. 

If you are in the Boston area and want to see awesome Trapeze work, the Boston Staff Show is on the 25th. (Beantown you get to see MY friends fly! They will be all in gold!) http://boston.trapezeschool.com/ Or take a class and fly yourself!

Friday morning Theresa and I had breakfast at a diner, then walked a bit around Wakefield before I took the commuter rail and T into Boston proper to hang out with Emily! Yay! It was awesome, we walked from her apartment along a portion of the freedom trail and since Em is a history buff, I pretty much had my own personal tour guide. One who could be convinced to have gelato before lunch. ;) The gelato was good, nice flavor, even though the tiramisu one had chunks of a cookie like thing that tasted of soggy bread in it. I didn't eat that part. Lunch was at a pub, and while my lobster was tasty, they got negative points on service, it took forever to get the food, and the clam chowder wasn't very good. There is NO excuse n New England to have bad clam chowder. None. Walked my feet sore, but saw a bunch of neat things, wandered through a farmers market and picked up inexpensive veggies, and headed back to the apartment to rest a bit. Em made homemade gourmet pizza for dinner, that almost was a no go when the cheese turned out to be bad, but Heather saved the day going down to the corner market and getting more cheese. Final result, Pizza with fresh basil and Roma tomatoes and capers was delicious! After dinner, we all headed out to a place that Zagat rated highly for desert.. I think my food Karma was just off for the day. The Bread pudding was at least tasty, but I almost missed my train home because they took so long. Ugh. Still it was fun hanging out. And I DID catch the train.

It rained Sat and I took a ""rain"" day. Stayed in and played on the computer (got the previous posts out)  and played a bit with Photos. Dinner when T got home at the local pub. I got delicious (redeemed!) clam chowder and a salad. They had homemade Irish soda bread they brought to the table that was fantastic. T's Spinach salad was missing the candied pecans (they were listed on the menu, it's not like we were expecting them unduly) 

Sunday lazy day as well, Finally got motivated and met T at work at 4ish. We went to get linner of Pizza, very yummy ""special"" with good stuff on it. I can't remember. what So sorry. After dinner, Theresa had staff fly, and I headed out to my next home in Boston with Alec and Brisket! Yay Alec. Thanks for having me. Alec had the leftover Pizza, then later that evening he made couscous with sausage. It was tasty. 

Monday I spent a few hours wandering through the local goodwill. Fun, fun, fun. Apple (honeycrisp) and garlic hummus (from TJ's) and Pita chips for lunch. Dinner unexpectedly was homemade borscht, sauteed greens, and sauteed hen-o-the woods mushrooms. We headed over to meet some friend of A's that lived down the street, with the intention of getting barbecue afterwards. We stayed late and watched Top Gun and were fed and never DID make it to the barbecue place. But the new friends are awesome and the mushrooms (my favorite) were much better than barbecue. At least in my opinion. :)

Tues we met Crystal, one of the new friends from the night before, for breakfast at a hippie-esq place, Clear Conscience Cafe, where I got a chai and a bagel with cream cheese.. or was that cream cheese with bagel? the proportions were equal. 1/2 inch bagel, 1/2 inch cream cheese. Good thing I like cream cheese. Em met us after breakfast and Alec she and I wandered around trying to go shopping. The stores we wanted weren't open, despite their signs saying they were supposed to be! After walking back and forth the 3 blocks between the two stores several times, Indian food was had by Em and Alec, who hadn't had breakfast. I still wasn't hungry though it did smell tasty. After Em left, Alec and I wandered, still waiting for the other stores, into a goodwill where I scored a fabulous REI rain jacket. (this will be important later, trust me). We then FINALLY found our target stores open, they had what I wanted, and we walked back to the house about 2 and a half miles. We took the scenic way through some of Harvard college. Detouring through a neat little exhibit of scientific stuff in the science building, along with the Mach 1 computer. The trees were looking pretty and we passed an awesome playground with this huge net like climbing structure. I restrained myself from climbing on it since it was swarming with kids. For dinner Heather met us at a local pub called Christopher's [http://www.christopherscambridge.com/home-flash.html]. I got a chocolate porter which was good but not great, and a fantastic hamburger. Wow. Huge and delicious. I got the ENGLISH BURGER  Coleman natural beef burger marinated in ale and grilled, with cheddar and Applewood smoked bacon, served on a large English muffin. It was exactly what I wanted and totally hit the spot. The good company just topped off a grand day.

Wed. Wandered around with Crystal. Fantastic breakfast at Sound Bytes [http://www.soundbitesrestaurant.com/] We shared 2 of the specials, a pear and goat cheese stuffed french toast with real maple syrup, and a smoked salmon and avocado eggs benedict. They were both really fantastic. More wandering, and chatting, and hanging out ensued. Dinner was tasty meat stuffs that Alec made. I have no idea what it was but it was yum. :)

Thurs morning I went back to Emily's for breakfast and final hanging out before I left. She made me abelskiver for breakfast. It is essentially danish donut holes? Or at least that is what it looks like. :) Tasty. Then back to Alec's to pack up, and off back to NJ. Wheeee..."

"event","Monday morning (Sept 28th) I lazed about a bit, then headed out, first briefly stopping to meet some online friend in person for the first time. Totally got sucked into conversation and it was horribly hard to leave! 

Long drive to Oshawa. Pretty much no traffic though for the win. There were all these signs on the highway about how over 50k over the speed limit is a min $10,000 fine for street racing. That said, most everyone went at least 20 to 30k over the 100k posted limit. I was only going 120k, and being passed by big rigs.

Arrived in Oshawa to dinner of roast chicken and noodles with Canadian cheese. Nice and tasty and filling and the company was superb! Jagatha (sp?) is just as soft and friendly as I remember from last time. She spent inordinate amounts of time on my bed, snuggling up with my jacket and slept with me at least part of the night every night I was there.

Tues was a veg day, hanging out with Brent and Suzie and Jag of course. Brent made Poached Eggs for breakfast with bacon and toast. I forgot how good and easy poached eggs are. :) Or maybe Brent just made it LOOK easy. Afternoon, Suzie and I headed to their Gym, where I got to swim about 1.5 laps in the pool before getting distracted by the water slide. How cool is that!! A few times down it and Suz and I relaxed in the hot tub thing and chatted for a while, then steam room (for a few minutes, I can't stay still that long) to complete the ""spa"" treatment and back to the house, where Brent made a delicious steak salad. The steak was absolutely perfectly cooked. Mmmmm Oh, random Chocolate martini in the afternoon for the win. I had never had one before and it was interesting and tasty.

Wed morning I headed to Toronto to visit with a Zara. After hitting lovely traffic (WTF it was 10:15 in the morning!!!) it took me a lot longer to get there than I expected. She made delicious Chive/Truffle oil crepes with a Leek, Mushroom, Chicken, spinach and garlic in cream, brie, and Parmesan sauce filling. Oh goodness. 
After ""Brunch"" We wandered to the Laurence market and sampled our way though. It is a lot more like the foreign markets I saw in Spain and France, than the US flea markets/Farmers markets, with food and non food, and rather permanent setups. Top floor is meat,  fish, cheese (I loved the chedar with Guinness in it), wine (local) and mustard. (yummy) also cooking supplies/Kitchen ware. Understory was clothing, jewelry, smoked fish/caviar, tea, and fresh veggies, and also something that looked like a small convenience store. (there was cooked food on both floors). 
Hideous traffic again heading back out to Oshawa. Toronto traffic apparently just always sucks. Dinner was tomato soup and grilled cheese. We started a movie, and I gave up halfway to go to bed.
Thurs (Oct 1st) after breakfast and Brent being a totalllllly awesome person and rotating my tires, I headed out to Boston and T! Long drive, nothing particularly notable about it. 

Next: Mass"

"event","The first five people to respond to this post will get something made by me! (keep in mind it is likey to be beaded, so if you don't wear earrings, please note that!)

This offer does have some restrictions and limitations:
- You might not like it.
- However, it will be just for you.
- It'll be done well within this year.
- I won't tell you what it is. You might get a story, a poem, a drawing, a painting, cookies, or a piece of jewelry (though you can specify a color and I might take it into consideration if I decide to do jewelry).
- I probably won't do anything I would find too terribly strange, but you never know.

The catch is that you have to repost this and do it for other people. It's like a chain letter, but way cooler."

"event","Happy New Year everyone! Hope you were all safe and had a wonderful time!

Special for 2009..
my cell phone conspired to not see in it's 5th New Years by joining in the
festivities New Years Eve and jumping into the hot tub a bit before
midnight. Guess it couldn't stand the thought of more abuse. :)

On the convenient side, a friend (thank you John!!!) just gave me their old
phone 2 weeks ago, so I should be able to just plug in my card and go.
However, I

1. cannot figure out how to get off the back of the new phone yet, to put in
my card (it's a Samsung with a tiny keyboard thing, any suggestions?)

2. Had more numbers in the old phone than the card would hold, so have
effectively (unless resurrection is possible, and the jury's still out on
that) lost all new numbers I have gotten since June or so.

3. In the meantime, have no phone. I'll try to be checking messages when I
can, but please make sure to leave your number so I can call you back if you
leave a message!

Wheeee.. at least there was hot water and lots of alchol and great friends.
Hugs to you all
-Lila

P.S. This especially means the people I met at House Hotting V. I won't have
any of your numbers now.. Nat? Parker? Monica?"

"event","So I am doing an early Thanksgiving post, since tomorrow I will be away from a computer likely for the entire day. 

We are going up to Camino Island to have the day with my Aunt and Uncle at my Aunt's place. Mother and I are bringing Mashed potatoes and Cauliflower soup. Both of which we are making today and will reheat tomorrow. Well we have pretty much finished the soup and it is delicious, so I figured I would share it with you. 

If for some reason someone out there doesn't know how to make great mashed potatoes and wants THAT recipe, let me know, but basically.. (the trick is add more butter)

But without further ado.. <lj-cut text=""Cream of Cauliflower Soup"">

<b>Cream of Cauliflower Soup</b>

<b>Ingredients</b>
2 leeks, including 2 inches of green, roots trimmed off
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 celery rib, with extra leaves, coarsely chopped
2 Tbsp finely minced garlic
2 tsp curry powder
2 tsp ground ginger
6 cups chicken or vegetable broth (more if necessary)
Juice of half a lemon
1 head cauliflower, cored and broken into florets
1 cup half-and-half
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

1. Cut leeks in half lengthwise. Wash to remove dirt. Pat dry and thinly slice crosswise.
2. Heat the oil with the butter in a heavy pot over low heat. Wilt the leeks and celery with leaves until softened, 10 minutes; add garlic during the last 5 minutes.
3. Stir in the curry powder and ginger, and cook over very low heat to permeate the vegetables, 1 minute.
4. Add the broth, lemon juice, and cauliflower florets. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the cauliflower is very tender, 15 minutes. Cool slightly.
5. Puree in a food processor (we used a blender) until very smooth, adding half and half through the feed tube. Add extra broth for desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

Remember that as a soup reduces, it's saltiness intensifies. If you intend to reheat, be cautious of over salting.

"event","So My cell phone battery is finally giving up the ghost.. It lasts about 2 phone calls, if that.. and I am getting mightily tired of having to charge it every day when I hardly use it. I don't have the money for a new phone right now, and I can't get a new plan at the moment, though that is probably in the future. 

Do any of you out in my large social network have (or know someone who has) an older (less than the 4 years mine is please) ATT/Cingular phone that still works pretty well that you don't need anymore, replaced for a newer model or picture abilities or somesuch? Bluetooth pretty necessary, but I need my phone to make and receive calls and have an alarm clock. Everything else is pretty much icing on the cake.

I have had my Nokia for forever and I will be bummed to let my little 3360 go, but this is getting beyond annoying. :(

Please."

Bay Area folks, have you heard about this acoustic music thing in Golden Gate Park this weekend?

Damn, but that looks good. And it's free. And, you know, Odetta. And Elvis Costello. Emmylou Harris and Shawn Colvin, singing together. I am also guessing there will be a lot of fiddling.

Went up to Mom's. Packed a lot of stuff, moved a lot of stuff, painted a lot of stuff. Thank you dinner from mom at a fantastic Thai Restaurant. If anyone is ever going to Seattle, and likes Thai food, totally worth the 1/2 hr drive south of the city. Mmmmmm.

Then up to Vancouver for a day and a half. Took a wander around the Vancouver Aquarium, (Monterey has totally spoiled me) then took a walk around part of the seawall in Stanley Park. I am really out of shape again, but it was pretty.
Found a neat all you can eat sushi place in Vancouver on Robson Street, somewhere between Nicola and Cardero, where 9:30pm-12am it is only $11.95, not so bad and great when you want something late. All the fish stuff was good, not too great a variety, but it was good anyway, I had loooots of salmon.

Saw lorn Man in Richmond, BC at the Imax, unfortunately on a regular screen, speed racer was on the Imax. :( Was ok anyway. Fun movie.

Tuesday headed down to Portland to celebrate a birthday with a friend for a day and a half. Good friends, cute dogs, great company, pool, and good beer. Dirk and Julie rock!

Thursday saw us driving through the central valley at over 100 degree heat in the truck with no AC. wheeeeeee.. to Willits, where we stopped to visit a friend and I got to meet his wife of 2 years for the first time. Sometimes I suck. Oops. On the other hand, she is awesome and I am glad to finally have met her.

This morning we headed back to Sebastopol/Occidental. It's hot here, but not too bad. The cat missed us.

What's up with all of you?"

and heading up to the Seattle area to help my mother move into her new
house. The new house has enough storage for a household of 15, so it will
all fit with room to spare.

I SHOULD be back around the 12th or so of May. The return date is undecided
as of yet.

"event","So I have my ipod hooked into my car sterio on random most days. 

The morning commute pretty much is background music with very little impinging on the conciousness needed to get from point A to point B. (considering thei is usually an hour drive at 6:30 in the morning..)

Sometimes however, the music penetrates.. 

Noteable last week was Steven Lynch's ""My Hermaphroditie""

this morning was ""I'm turning Japaneese"" I didn't realize I even HAD that song.. Now the damn thing won't get out of my head!!

The little zebra was coming back to his ward of the savanna after doing some important errands, when an odd scene caught his eye.

His local polling place was packed. The lines were very long, and overwhelmingly composed of tired, confused-looking antelopes.

At that moment, Mr. Giraffe whistled for the zebra to come over.

""Hey, Zebra,"" hissed Mr. Giraffe. ""We need your help here! We're overwhelmed.""

""Are you getting out the vote?"" asked the zebra innocently.

""Are you kidding? No, we've got to win this thing, Zebra. B.A.M.N. That's right, an acronym. 'By Any Means Necessary.' For the good of this savanna. Listen, put on one of these T-shirts.""

""Why?"" said the zebra, as he was handed a T-shirt with the phrase ""Anti-Fraud Enforcement"" written across the chest. He noticed that Mr. Giraffe and several menacing-looking hyenas were wearing them, too.

""Check out these antelopes, little Zebra,"" said the giraffe under his breath. ""All looking for a free handout. And that music they listen to. Well, we're not gonna let them, or their NAAAP thugs, steal this from us. Here's what I want you to do. See that old antelope over there? Tell her she's at the wrong polling place. Then, if she acts confused, tell her she needs to show you six forms of ID.""

""But what about free elections?""

""That's cute,"" said Mr. Giraffe. He turned quickly around to see a couple of young, idealistic-looking antelopes getting in line. ""Hey, guys, you know if you've got any outstanding parking tickets we're going to have to arrest you if you check in to vote. It's all right there in the fine print. And if you have any parking misdemeanors on your record? You're going away for a long, long time.""

The antelopes scattered away.

""This is illegal!"" protested the zebra.

""You're illegal, Zebra. You're illegal. Shut the fuck up. I mean, do you want 'Hanoi' Hippo to win this thing? If he gets in, the vampire bats win.""

""I feel bad about this ...,"" whined the zebra.

""You do what we tell you, or we'll take the tax exemptions away from your synagogue! And another thing: If you see any born-again rhinos come to this precinct, or any fat lions wearing ""Who Farted?"" T-shirts, send them to the front of the line. And give them 11 ballots. I can't wait to read wild African jackass Bill Kristol's column tomorrow!""

""Well,"" shrugged the young zebra. ""At least I'll go to my grave knowing that no cheetah couples ever gained hospital-visitation rights or filed joint tax returns on my watch! Phew!""

...instead of going snowboarding which was the tentative plan I and J headed out to the coast after breakfast. We took out the '55 Chevy and got most of the way there before we ran into a wall o'Fog. Deep, White, not going to Bodega Head Fog. 
I got J to take a picture before we turned back. <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flitterkit/pic/00097x10/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flitterkit/pic/00097x10/s320x240"" width=""160"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
(My mother specifically asked for pictures of the day I turned 30. Humoring Mothers is a good thing sometimes)
Instead of heading back to the house we turned south hoping to find beach not fogged in and succeeded admirably at Bolinas beach after a beautiful drive. Took the camera and wandered down the beach to the rocks, it was warm enough to comfortably wear a t-shirt.<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flitterkit/pic/00098e1a/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flitterkit/pic/00098e1a/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""213"" border='0'/></a> 

Beautiful, sunny day. For some odd reason there were ladybugs all over the waterline. Got a picture of 2 live ones I coaxed onto to a piece of sea grass.

Wandering from there ended us at Mount Tamalpias (Mount Tam, just north of San Francisco) were we took in the view and a few more pictures. <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flitterkit/pic/0009f33e/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flitterkit/pic/0009f33e/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""213"" border='0'/></a>
Next with the wandering to SF for dinner.. Interesting and unusual sushi at Sushi Bistro on Balboa at 7th. Still not sure if I love the place, but the staff is nice and the food is creative and different. 
On the way home I talked J into stopping at Foster's Freeze and I got a small vanilla soft serve ice cream. It was the perfect finisher to a beautiful day. [click on any picture to see the rest of the photos I took]

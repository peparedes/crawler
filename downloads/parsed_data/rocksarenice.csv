"event","""There is always an easy way out, although I am loath to use it. I have no children, I do not watch television and I do not believe in God--all paths taken by mortals to make their lives <i>easier</i>. Children help us to defer the painful task of confronting ourselves, and grandchildren take over from them. Television distracts us from the onerous necessity of finding projects to construct in the vacuity of our frivolous lives: by beguiling our eyes, television releases our mind from the great work of making meaning. Finally, God appeases our animal fears and the unbearable prospect that someday all our pleasures will cease. Thus, as I have neither future nor progeny nor pixels to deaden the cosmic awareness of absurdity, and in the certainty of the end and the anticipation of the void, I believe I can affirm that I have not chosen the easy path.""  --Renee Michele, ""The Elegance of the Hedgehog"", pp 176-177"

The 2,057 clouds - made of helium, soap and vegetable dye - drifted over the Thames and the City of London.

i made a minor mention of my back a few months ago while talking to my dad on the phone. i told him that i got another tattoo, a tree, on my back. he thought i said i planted a tree in my backyard.

i talked to him again the other day and mentioned that the tree on my back is pretty big. he grumbled and made some comments, but to cut long story short, we'll see how it all plays out tomorrow...

"event","my head's been spinning with ""what the fuck am i doing with my life"" deal. so goes life after school. 

right now the stress, physical strain, and long hours of work are taking its toll on me. it's the same old complaint though..the feeling of working my life away at something i don't necessarily enjoy. aaron's been flying me out to l.a. and san diego to hang with him while he works, but it just makes me jealous and unsettled about what i'm doing for a career. i'm surrounded by all these talented people who are either entrepreneurs, work for themselves, do what they love for a living, or all of the above. isn't that a fantasy? actually turning a hobby into a successful career? i wish i could do the same but i feel the true reality is that not everyone can be that lucky. my dad has always said that to get through in life, you either have a skill or education. i always followed the education route to be safe since it was the ""right"" way. i feel a little caught because when it comes down to it, isn't having a good job that you can support yourself with good enough? when are you asking for too much? 

part of me tells me to suck it up and the other part says life is too short to toil away at something you have no passion for. on one hand, i make a livable salary, have a job that definitely has room for advancement, all while living in hawaii. on the other, i miss the bay, my friends, and the satisfaction that i'm making it by doing something i enjoy. maybe the grass will always be greener on the other side. i'm not even quite sure what i'd rather be doing. part of my fear is that i won't be successful, the other part is that i won't enjoy life. i feel like i'm too serious about life sometimes. i haven't felt like my age in over a year.. it's almost like i lost a year of my youth. i always forget that i'm only 23. ..yet i don't regret how far i've come.

meh.

it's all a frickin' cycle."

we went to a local style bbq celebration..straight up boars roasting on a spit @ a beach park. whaaat.

</lj-cut>

i had a random adventure today. i went to the beach to soak up some sun and feel-good vibes from the ocean. i was laying out in an area that was pretty isolated from other people so i could get some privacy. a saw a guy walk past, but i thought nothing of it. then i saw him walk by again. the third time he walked by, he approached me. he was at least 40, wearing sunglasses, jeans, tennis shoes, and a long sleeve shirt with no towel or bag. on a beach.  he asked me where a certain beach was (which was actually pretty far from where we were) since he had just got off a bus and was looking for a nude beach to do some suntanning. apparently he was entering a male stripping contest that night in waikiki (yikes). that caught me off guard. i suggested a tanning salon, but he wanted a cheaper way. then he invited me go to the strip contest. i declined. he chattered a bit more and i politely quipped in here and there. as he got up to leave, he then asked if he could do his routine for me so i could tell him what i thought. oh hell no. he was giving off creepy vibes like crazy. i was looking around me thinking ""oh shit, what if this guy rapes me"". i declined his offer, stating that i had a jealous boyfriend and he walked off..but i saw him watching me as he walked off. i decided that i didn't need so much privacy anymore and moved to a more public area. yeesh.

other than that, I GOT THE PROMOTION!! i manage my own store now. my head is spinning with all the new responsibilities and customers. the downside is that the assistant manager has been with the company about ten years and had also applied for the manager position. although he's helpful and pretty approachable, i know and sense a little resentment every so often. but it is what it is. gotta bust my ass even harder now, especially since i'm the youngest out of the whole store and the only female. feels a little bit like i have something to prove. this week i must have put in 65 hours. i feel like i'm 23 going on 30. 

looking forward to my trip to la. aaron just finished up a studio job for spike tv and is flying me out for his show on thursday. wee. i get to see the sister, EAT AT TOFU-YA, do some decent shopping, and relax. and of course, see my babes. :)"

going to the big island next month!

a new store is opening up in june and i applied for the manager's position. the idea of becoming a branch manager freaks me out in the level of responsibility (wondering if i can handle being liable for everything--employees, the store, inventory, impending issues with contractors..all while pushing sales, growth and being a good leader.). but i find that i'm pretty comfortable in my current position...meaning it's time to push the envelope to the next level.

i find myself calming down a bit in my partying. probably a combination of newfound responsibilities since january and the new relationship status. as linh puts it, ""when you're single, you're looking for stimuli everywhere and to keep busy. with a boyfriend/girlfriend, the stimulus is there..as well as the keeping busy."" hm.

"event","after my last visit to the bay, i've been trying to turn a new leaf. trying to get inspired again, but it's too easy to fall back into the same habits; especially when whatever the things that inspired me are about 2400 miles away. just something about the bay. the vibe. i was going to try taking some art classes at a community college, but registration is over and classes have already started. 

on the upside, i've decided to see how long i can hang with sobriety. even though i've been going to the bars with friends, i'm a little over two weeks now without a drop of alcohol hitting my lips. a lot of thoughts on this but i'm not comfortable with sharing. 

in a few days, the one year anniversary of my move to hawaii will occur. don't really know my thoughts on this. after talking with a friend, he noted that my move has changed me. not necessarily in a good way since i've seemed to have taken on a mentality that we are all alone in this world. fuck everyone else since a person has no one to depend on but himself/herself. a lonely perspective, but taken on in order to survive. do what you want and live your life because no one else is going to live it for you. seize life one opportunity at a time. i've drifted from some people, but i don't necessarily know if that's a good or bad thing. i do believe everything happens for a reason. that's all i'm going to say about it.

in griping news, groceries are fucking expensive. i bought a honeydew at safeway a couple weeks ago and a regular sized honeydew weighing about two pounds cost me <b>ten</b> bucks. wtf. so i've been pretty stoked whenever i get the chance to buy groceries from the commissary at the marine corp base. i save a little over 50 percent on my groceries over there. score.

i've been reading a little bit lately:
""Hollywood has generally scripted us to believe that we are not responsible, that we are a product of our feelings. But Hollywood does not describe the reality. <b>If our feelings control our actions, it is because we have abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to do so.</b>""

In other words, you can <b>let</b> situations affect you or take initiative to find other solutions.

""It's not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. Of course, things that can hurt us physically or economically can cause sorrow. <b>But our character, our basic identity, does not have to be hurt at all.</b>""

Just gotta find that strength.

"event","awesome trip. i came back refreshed and with newer perspectives.
the trip to new york went extremely well and i had an amazing time, considering the only planning i did was send out some vague emails that i was going to be in town.

<lj-cut text=""extremely long and detailed novel about the trip under the cut."">
hawaii was about 80 degrees when i left.
i flew into california (and was met with a crisp 50 degrees), ate dinner, said hi to my cat, and trekked over to san francisco to bar-it with the steve-eph-sean-matt crew. i introduced cazadores, which was met with mixed reviews. later was late night jack-in-the-box and arguing about who was going to sleep on the couch vs. the floor. the next morning i went on a shopping frenzy on haight and powell (i can't even explain how ecstatic i was to be around fashion and affordable style). went home to have dinner with my parents and visited my grandma, who had a stroke about a month ago. her memory isn't very good and she gets confused here and there.. i didn't expect her to remember me, but she had a big smile of recognition when she saw me. we talked awhile and eventually we headed home. spent another night out in the city @ impala and headed home at a timely 2am.

the next day, i ate lunch with my parents. i was so scattered and unrushed about repacking that i missed my flight to nyc (plus a miscommunication with my ride since i didn't specify that i was going to sfo). i took a nap with sam and took the later flight out (which worked out pretty well since that meant i would land into ny @ 6am instead of 12am). the flight went smooth since i was reading an entertaining book (water for elephants by sara gruen--a fiction about a guy who walked out on his cornell final exams and joined a circus) and had downed a few shots of vodka, which put me into a nice slumber through the ride. 

i got into jfk and was met with ""ohmygod it's 30 degrees"" weather. the only other time i've been to new york city was once, for one day. and now i had to somehow maneuver my way through the subway to michele's apartment in brooklyn. with my luggage. after being clueless in front of the metrocard station for 10 minutes and being stumped to how to drag my luggage through the carousel, everything went fine. i had to make one transfer and walk another 3 blocks before entering a nicely heated apartment. unfortunately michele had to leave for work soon, so i decided to go walking and subway hopping for the day, exploring the city on my own. she directed me towards soho (more great shopping) and i walked into chinatown, where then i saw the manhattan bridge and decided to walk across it. i think i ended up at the grittier side of brooklyn. i spotted a white castle and i decided to try it out since it's so-ever-present in pop culture thanks to harold and kumar (the food is overrated). halfway through my meal, a guy walks in hustling bootleg dvds.

afterwards i walked around some more and was getting tired, so i hopped onto a random subway station and ended up by times square. i walked past penn station (and wandered in to see what the big hype about THAT was.), and then settled in a coffee shop to people-watch through the window while sipping on a latte and indulging in my book. the coffee shop was linked to the fuse tv building, which was where michele was conveniently working, so she finished work and we had dinner at a nice little thai place. we later went to my first-ever broadway play @ lyceum theatre since her friend works in publicity and gets free tickets when new plays come out. i wasn't too enthusiastic about the play since i didn't think i was a play person. i was expecting to doze off since i was so tired. it was actually an amazing play. i was pretty enraptured in the performance, a comedic mark twain play called ""is he dead?"". the play was about the painter jean-francois millet, who stages his death in order to be able sell his paintings. however, he dresses up pretends to be his widowed sister. the play was hilarious and the cast was dynamic.. i wish i could watch it again.  

afterwards we went to the bar by her apartment, called barcade (basically a lot of retro arcade games and a wide selection of beers). grabbed a drunken sandwich from the deli down the street (as recommended by one of the friendly barcade patrons we met) and slept.

the next day, i subway-ed myself and luggage to manhattan. rosa, who was on a trip to chicago, decided to fly straight to new york and meet up with me. our friend stephanie had moved out to nyc earlier in the year to go for her grad degree @ parsons in graphic design. rosa and i trekked out into the streets and decided to do some more subway hopping. we tried to get to little italy, but failed and decided to walk around the financial district. then we decided that we would go into every bar we saw, take a shot, and move on (one of them was a beckett's. i didn't even know they would have a bar.). we were around our third stop, ulysses, and then got comfortable. i was drawn into their raw bar menu, which featured lobster tail, a bunch of shrimp, raw oysters and clams, and an assortment of sauces for only 50 bucks. after a certain time, stephanie met up with us and the bar filled with a bunch of suit and ties, individuals from wall street and beyond celebrating the end of the soul-sucking work week. we eventually wound up at another bar, where we made friends with the bartenders and patrons.

we spent the night in at steph's place and met her other two roommates, an adorable asian girl from ireland (complete with accent) and a mellow argentinian girl, both fashion merchandising students, also at parsons. i knocked out pretty early while steph and rosa caught up.

saturday was spent sleeping in and lounging around. we went to the banksy exhibit (as suggested/requested by steve and michele's interest), a small hole-in-a-wall gallery with a line snaking around the corner. it was a good exhibit. one of my favorites was a simple stencil that read, ""people who wave flags don't deserve to have one"". we went to a dallas bbq spot later with texas-sized proportions. afterwards, we headed to a housewarming party, hosted by one of rosa's friends. it was an older, more wordly crowd. we stayed for a little before rosa, steph, and i had to meet up with steph's friend and michele had to meander off to eventually meet up with her friends. on the walk home, we went in search of liquor at the convenience stores around steph's apartment (and made friends with the store owners. we ended up in frequent trips to the same stores for the rest of the trip. one store had a stray cat that wanders in there for warmth. rosa took a picture of me petting it and the shop owner asked for a copy, along with a picture of all of us. he probably meant it out of jest because when we went back later with actual picture printouts, he looked a little weirded out. but who knows. maybe those pictures are posted up in the store.). we went on one of the most random bar-hopping adventures i've ever had (the night before i got my tattoo is still ranked up there though.) since none of us really knew where we were going and where we were going to.

the first bar was a few blocks from steph's place. we took some shots and decided to move on because we wanted to dance. while walking down the street, rosa was lured in by the muffled rhythms of ""culo"" by pitbull, emanating from a bar. a guy was outside the door, with a girl that was hanging all over him. rosa talked to the guy, who said we should come in and that we should show our ids since he was the bouncer. we flashed our cards and walked in halfway before an angry israeli guy flagged us down to make us show our ids. turns out the guy outside was just fucking with us. the bar turned out to be an israeli bar, with people sitting in booths and smoking hookah. a few more pitbull songs played and then the israeli music came on. it was entertaining watching the dance floor. we eventually resolved that we wanted to dance and moved on. rosa was pretty drunk by then, with steph buzzed and myself pretty sober.

we decided to go to soho since that was where a lot of bars and clubs were. hopped around, found neighborhood bars, asked where to go, more walking around. i felt like the night was going to be a bust until we came across a bar-clubby looking place. there was a $10 cover, so the bouncer said one of us could go in to check it out. i walked in and simply saw a packed place with people dancing and danceable music. i rushed out and told steph and rosa that this was the place to be. after we showed ids, paid cover, and walked inside, it dawned on me that it was a lesbian club. which would make more sense since the bouncers were a bunch of tough looking females. we decided to say ""fuck it"" and stay. haha. it was fun. there was maybe 2 guys in that place. rosa was sobering up and stephanie was pretty drunk by then, while i was buzzing. 

we wandered around some more after that, went into a restaurant/bar for a shot, where rosa chatted a little with some wall st. guy. the bouncers pointed us towards a more danceable spot, so we hailed a cab and went over there. more random conversations with more bouncers. people kept referring us to check out a-p-t. we walked up and down the street about 3 times before we saw an inconspicuous door that simply looked like a door to an apartment building (which, in the morning after, i realized a-p-t stood for/meant APARTMENT. ah ha! i had a thomas edison moment with the lightbulb.). we tried to get in and the bouncer refused us, but rosa kept saying ""fuck you! we're already here!"". he eventually relented and we walked in, 15 minutes before they turned the lights on. it was 2am by now, but apparently there was a downstairs bar/club open until 4am. we hung for awhile, hopped back to the club where the bouncers were trying to get us to go in, but it was already 10 minutes to closing. by now, rosa was sober, stephanie was tipsy, and i was drunk.

we decided to get pizza and some guys started to conversate with us. rosa initiated conversation with 2 other girls that were in the parlor and we all sat together. one of guys walked with us to make sure we made it home on the subway, and he was going in the same direction. we made it home. eventually. it was pretty sweet that the 3 of us were all drunk, sober, and tipsy at different times of the night since we conveniently took turns navigating through the city.

we lounged sunday. on monday, i decided to extend my trip one more night so we could go out tuesday, which stephanie heard was a good night to go out since it's industry night. rosa and i went subway hopping and exploring around rockefeller. we had dinner at max brenner's which basically specialized in a shitload of different chocolatey goodness-es. mmmm. tuesday was more shopping and we went to a psychic for the hell of it. rosa ended up calling the wall st. guy we met the other night at the bar for some drinks and asked if he had a friend. carpe diem. sure, why the hell now? we're in new york. so later on, we met up with the guy and his friend for some drinks. it sucked in the beginning, since the guy was 41 and a pretentious fuck who owned a hedge fund something-or-other. after he got put in his place, he started to loosen up and was actually decent company. i had a stimulating conversation, which was refreshing in the intellectual challenge compared to living on this rock. afterwards rosa and i headed back to steph's get ready for our last night in the city. we were somewhat celebrating rosa's birthday, my promotion, and stephanie''s internship that turned into a job that day. we partied like rockstars and met a turkish pastry chef and his buddy, who gave us rides back to the apartment. we rested for about an hour before rosa caught her plane to the bay and i caught mine to honolulu. i was still a little drunk. to add onto that, no thanks to the 4.5 inch heels i wore that night, my feet had turned into swollen sausages that barely fit into my shoes. 6 hour flight to lax, 1 hour layover, another 5 hour flight to hawaii.

it's definitely a more aggressive place. not to mention the people. the diversity and all the different accents (but more european-based, imo.)! 

it's such a change up from hawaii. i wouldn't mind living in new york and would love to try it, but only for about 6 months, just for kicks. 

it was great to be around a big metropolitan area again. and to be around familiar people. a lot of things to sort out in my mind about personal growth, but i also know i overthink a lot.

i'm too lazy to post pictures in here. you can look in my myspace for them.

and that concludes my vacation. i can't wait for my next one. i have my heart set on traveling outside of the country within the next year, but i need to find a travel companion. 
</lj-cut>

in work-related banter,
i'm not gonna be transferred to maui! i'm highly relieved and slightly disappointed at the same time. i had already put my mind frame into accepting the move and i was looking forward to the spot that i was going to move in (great living area, seemingly really chill roommates, a porch lanai with a hammock!, and PETS!--2 dogs and a cat. i miss having animals around.). 

in the ""trying-accomplish-more"" chatter,
the pretentious hedge fund guy in new york commented that i seemed bored in hawaii. for some reason, i never realized it until he said it. yea, i'm bored. even though i'm progressing in the company, something's missing. maybe it's the fact that i know i'm not going to stay in this job forever. or the fact that i've been continuously thinking how nice it would be to get my master's. so within the past 2 days, i've been trying to get off my ass and see what i need to do if i wanna get an mba..if the company will help pay, what school options i have around here, and if i can do a simple one year program since i would already have a year's experience. i don't know. i'll just see how it turns out."

i took the first flight to out to maui tuesday morning. visited the stores, drove around the island, and looked at possible places to live. after conducting the store visit, i see why the DM wants to place me there. he feels like the store there is too stagnant and needs a new spark. i think there's a lot of good opportunity for me to establish myself by working my ass off and attempting to bring up the sales volume. career-wise, the move to maui would be good for me. i'm gonna make the sacrifice and see where i can go with this. if it doesn't work out, at least i gave it my best shot.  

it's all about being adaptable. one of the biggest hurdles i'm going to face is that it's going to be a transitional phase all over again. building up new social networks, connections, and all of that. i'll be miserable for the first few months, but it'll work out. that's the only outlook i can have in order to make it through.

"event","so. i'm really leaning towards relocating to maui. since i've never really spent any time in maui or know much about the island, the DM said i should fly there for a day visit, rent a car, check the island out, and then fill out an expense report to get reimbursed. score! free trip to maui.

i figure i can't hate on or automatically think something sucks without giving it a try first and really putting in my effort to make it work. if anything, i can work my ass off for a few months, impress the higher-ups, and start posting for a position transfer to the mainland. or i can just tell the DM, ""i'm sorry. i'm just not happy here."" everyone warns me that it's much slower on that island. i'm hoping i'll at least find some fun roommates to live with.

if i decide to accept the job and the job is given to me, it's going to be a stressful month. the DM hopes to get me into maui by the end of the year, which means i have less than a month to get all my shit together, pack up, secure a place to live, and move (not to mention the week that i'm going to be in california and new york). somehow i've managed to accumulate a lot of things within 9 months (i'm just a natural packrat). at least the company pays to move my stuff. i love where i live though (i've finally made my room feel like my space.). my landlord/roommate is understandably upset at how last-minute notice this possible move is. he's telling me i need to tell him ASAP since he may have someone to take my room December 1st. sheesh.

sigh. i guess stability and security won this round. i'm following the cash for now. you get shaped by your societal situations in doing what you need to in order to survive (a progressive view carried over from fieldman's IR 310 class.). there's always time for uncertainty and chaos later.

we'll see how everything pans out..."

today i decided to be a nerdy tourist and go to the hawaiian plantation village where they have guided tours of a sugar cane plantation where the intermingling of different immigrants occurred in the hard work of plantation life. our tour guide was an old, cute, little filipino lady who was born into the backbreaking acreage way of life. she was full of energy, love, spirit, and life. after the tour ended, she welcomed us to eat some of the food she had cooked (apparently she loves cooking and mondays happen to be potluck days between the docents at the place.). i ended up having home grown sweet potato leaf salad, turkey tail adobo, bread pudding, and other assortments of food. mm. i stayed awhile since the food was good and i enjoyed being in her motherly presence. and then i ended playing mahjong with 3 other 75+ year old ladies who were also docents at the place.

man. too many things are whirling in my head. i'm waiting to see how things pan out at work and then i just may say ""fuck it"" and move back to the bay around the beginning of next year.

the next day, we lounged, watched football until the afternoon, then went to a mexican food place and the power shut down because it was storming. the waitress was apologetic and gave us free shots of cazadores. we went to another mexican joint (sidenote: kailua's a beautiful place. the rain, cloudy weather, and foliage outside where we ate made me feel like i was in the bay during the fall for a moment.), ate, and had margaritas and good times. 
the subject of tattoos came up. so we ended up at a tattoo parlor, where the husband was thinking about getting one of his tattoos covered up. i ended up getting tattooed (music notes on my inner right wrist and left hip), and the wife also got tattoooed (modified nautical star). after some more shots of patron afterwards, i decided to get my rook pierced. i ended up making friends with the guy who pierced and tattooed me and he invited us to go to the bar with them, but i was already too wasted and passed out on the couple's couch for another night.

me: i'm not sure if i like it. maybe it's just because i'm not used to it.

You are a fairly energetic person. You know how do pace yourself, and you deal well with stress.

You are somewhat outgoing, but you're not a natural extrovert. You think first before you act. You tend to be independent, rational, and logical.

You are balanced and grounded. You know how to get along well with others.

i had whale meat the other night. my roommate's friend brought it from japan. apparently it's a felony to eat endangered species in the u.s. so he was sweating bullets at the airport. it tasted a bit like turkey jerky."

"event","parents visited for 5 days last week. i played tour guide for the whole 5 days. it was fun--they never go on vacation ANYWHERE. drove them around the island, visited the dole plantation, kualoa ranch (apparently where they film[ed] lost, jurassic park, windtalkers, 50 first dates, etc etc), pearl harbor, chinatown, ala moana, waikiki, koko marina.. brought them to the hot eatery spots--giovanni's shrimp truck, pho to chau (remember that seinfeld episode with the soup nazi? believe me, there's a pho nazi here. steve knows whats up.), ono's hawaiian foods, big city diner, (and surprisingly, we didn't eat chinese food ONCE during their stay) and tried dragonfruit. the best part was being able to bring them to a nice upscale restaurant, hiroshi's (the friend i met through brendt when we all went fishing on july 4th), as well as a luau, where i decided that my stiff ""all-about-responsibilities"" dad needed to let loose on this vacation and have fun. ...so i brought him long island ice teas (doused with generous additions from my flask when he wasn't looking). after teetering and tottering around, i brought him to the bathroom, where he yakked. but i made sure he went to sleep with plenty of water and aspirin in his system. he said he had an awesome time. although i'm not too sure he trusts me around him with alcohol anymore. 

my mom kept staring up at the coconut trees during the whole trip and exclaiming how she could just bring them home if the wind blew hard enough to knock them down... don't even get me started on the mango, avocado, and lychee trees..

he asked me again why i chose to move so far to hawaii. he still thinks i was trying to get away from him and my mom. i told him that i wanted to test my character. 
i take my parents for granted and i feel horribly guilty. i feel it's a character flaw within myself that i don't have enough patience with them.

meh. doing the whole work grind. it takes me a few days to recover and catch up in sleep when i go out. looking forward to the next 2 months. 
i remember reading somewhere in a college pamphlet, ""there are 3 things in college: school, sleep, and a social life. you can only have two."" i feel like it can be revised now to: ""there are 3 things you can currently have: financial stability/a career, sleep, and a social life. you can only have two."" well. to a certain extent.

sometimes i feel like i'm growing up too fast here. sometimes i feel like i'm not going fast enough. or doing enough. lot of conflict. i think i'm just pressuring myself too much to squeeze everything i can do in life. the fact that i will never get these years back and i don't want to regret not doing something.

sometimes i feel like i'm slowly morphing into someone else. it's hard to explain. my environment has been affecting me a lot. to where i sometimes question some of my beliefs that i held so strong when i was in the bay. ..evolving? possibly.
i feel a slight brain drain within myself. i'm too tired to read and catch up on the news. even my writing has taken on a simpler format and form of diction. there's less proofreading and the grammatical flow is definitely more choppy.

the social structure here is interesting. the working class, ""ghettos"", and projects. hrm.

i miss having unpretentious intellectual conversations and witty banter."

i have 8 vacation days to use before the year ends. thinking i'll spend about 2 days in the bay and then 3 or 4 in new york. anyone want to [seriously] come with? if not, i'm just gonna wing it and go on my own. i've been wanting to visit ny for awhile. i'll figure it out. but going from 80+ degree weather to 20 and below's gotta be pretty harsh. it'll be sometime between november 12th to december 16th. i'm buying tickets soon.

my roommate is seriously on my shitlist now after a few incidents. she's arrogant, inconsiderate, and thinks the world revolves around her. i've never had a bad roommate experience until now. we don't even bother with the pleasantries and civility of saying hi to each other anymore.

a girl's voice woke me up in the morning. she was extremely upset. it took me awhile to familiarize her voice and realize that she was john's girlfriend. turns out he was assaulted and mugged last night. as she put it, his face was mashed up and he's missing some of his front teeth. fucked up. i'm still reeling from the news. he's gonna need facial reconstructive surgery and some dental work done. un-fucking-believable. he's one of the most laidback chill guys you could know. he's not an obnoxious drunk. there is some tension here between the locals and haoles, but that's a whole 'nother discussion that has enough material to be curriculum in an ethnic studies class.

<lj-cut text=""I.D. 2007."">

one of the most memorable july 4ths ever. i got the chance to join one of my roommate's frequent fishing expeditions. woke up at 2:30am to get ready to dock out. by 4 or 5am-ish, we were in the water. it was my roommate brendt, his buddy hiroshi (who, interestingly enough, is a <a href=""http://www.restauranteur.com/hiroshi/""target=""_blank"">local chef</a>), and two other folks. it was a pretty crazy experience. marlins and mahimahis were the catches of the day.

when we got back to the dock, i joined in on brendt's other july 4th festivities. apparently he was going to take the boat to watch the waikiki fireworks at night from the water. we boated from the hawaii kai side of the island over to ala moana and picked some people up. lo and behold, the group of people he was picking up from the dock was a group of approximately 10 bikini-clad women carrying food and beer. talk about every guy's fantasy.

we met up with another boat in the water and more folks. there was a ""floatilla"" going on, where the water was flooded with even more people and boats, just drinking, eating, hanging, and having a good time. i saw some lady swimming in the water while holding on tight to her half-empty 40. ha.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v46/rocksarenice/l_4fb633a57ca98ecc0ff64d13abaa386f.jpg"" /> <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v46/rocksarenice/DSC01614.jpg"" />


fun times. we watched the sunset and waited for the fireworks. spectacular show. afterwards, during the ride back to the other dock, we were stopped by the boat police. ha. i was slightly amused that the boat police and the ""i'm the law"" attitude were so comparable to the CHP. there was some hassling about possible boating under the influence, but we managed to squeeze out of that one. the ride back was ridiculously fun. sitting on the top deck next to brendt driving the boat, i felt like i was in a convertible with the top down. except the air would be full of salty spray and we were bouncing around like crazy by zipping through the waves in high speeds.

i felt like a giddy little kid that night. i don't remember ever being that excited and happy watching fireworks. granted, some of the giddiness probably came from the continuous flow of beers all day, but it was a pretty surreal feeling. if i were to tap my shoulder a year ago and say, ""hey. next july 4th, you're going to be floating in a boat in hawaii watching fireworks. you're going to be living here knowing that you don't have any friends or family around."" .. i'd be ridiculously incredulous.

on that note, i've been slowly acclimating. i'm not check flight fares back to california as much and i'm gradually building up a social life. can't seem to quite meet people my age group.. or at least those seem to be on the same level of maturity/having their head on straight. hanging with a slightly older crowd. they give some good wisdom and perspectives (and man, do hawaiians age well.). the past week has been pretty crazy. within the past 3 nights, i have accumulated 8 hours of sleep. i'm surprised i'm not passed out right now.

i'm learning a lot. i've been having good conversations with a friend whose roots are here. i'm getting schooled on the history, way of life, attitudes, beliefs, and interactions among other things. 

things happen for a reason. that's a logic that comforts me when things seem crazy at the moment."

i moved out to hawaii for a reason and it's not simply to lose myself into becoming another mindless drone of work. i have barely fully experienced the whole island since i'm [STILL] waiting for my car to get shipped out here.

i feel like doing something drastic. that always gets things going to make me feel that i'm not losing myself. (like moving to hawaii?)

i've always wanted to try bartending. maybe i'll go fill out an application or two for a part-time barbacking gig to start off. 60 hours a week? it's possible. i've done it before.

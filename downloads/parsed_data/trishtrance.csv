On a lighter note ~ I hung out with a sweet guy tonight and I had a really, really, really great time. He is a cool cat, that's for sure. We went to La Bella Italia for dinner and now that is my all-time favorite restaurant... yum! I actually felt like I was in Europe because the atmosphere was amazing in there. Oh yes, and not to mention that there are all foreigners working there. :) So... I am getting a job there. I have to go back tomorrow after 5 and talk to the lady and I really, really hope she hires me. She said she needs a ""bread/buss girl"" in about 2 weeks and that would be sweeeeeet because she said they make 6 dollars hourly plus tips!!! And that's bad ass money for just having to bring bread to the table then help clean afterwards! How exciting! Plus, I would get to meet allt he Euros that work in there and make new friends from different countries. Only down side is it is way the hell out on Laskin but who cares - it is most definately worth it! 
After dinner we went back to his place and watched a movie called 'Employee of the Month'... one of the coolest movies everrr. Then I started to get sleepy so I came home. I had a really, really great time hanging with him... he's my new super nice friend. 
When I got home I talked to Alex for over an hour. He seems like a really nice guy and I cannot wait to meet him. Maybe I will meet him tomorrow... or this weekend... we'll see. 
I am exhausted right now... thank God I can sleep in. :)
I hope Jenny had a great time at Ashley... I can't wait to talk to her tomorrow!"

"event","Yesterday I sat around the house all day like a fat lazy blob. All day I was debating whether or not to go to the Mae show and I finally decided on going and I am so glad I did. I went to pick up Jenny and we had a blast. We were definately the oldest people there but it's okay because it was really fun. It was funny because while we were standing in line to get our tickets from will call, we were pretty much getting high from the fumes of the dreaded <b>X</b> marker! Hahaha... I don't miss that shit one bit!
The first band was putting us to sleep so we went to get some expensive ass NorVa beers. The bartender let us sample Dos Equis and it went down real smooth so that's what I got. It was kind of a cheap version of Corona but still good. So after getting our beer we saw her junior high crush but he was with a girl so Jenny didn't say anything. We looked away for one second and when we looked back he was gone! So we spent the majority of the night looking for him because I told Jenny she HAD to talk to him. We couldn't find him all night... crazyness. Thanks to Jenny, I got to talk to the person I wanted to talk to but the conversation was SO lame. 

Me: ""Hey!""
Him: ""Hi!""
Me: ""I like your hair!""
Him: ""I like yours too!""
AKWARD MOMENT OF SILENCE...
Me: ""Okay, bye.""
And I walked away. Geez...

Since we hadn't seen Ty (her junior high crush) we decided to wait and watch everyone exit and we saw finalyl saw him! He walked by and I thought Jenny wasn't going to say anything so I yelled his name and then so did Jenny... ""TY! TY! TY!"" He turned around and waved but did not really recognize her and when we walked out he was staring at her. I bet he's still thinking about her today like, ""Who's that hot girl that said hi to me?"" Hahaha.
So we left the NorVa and went to the parking garage and I called my ""ex friend with benefits"" hahaha. Jenny was laughing sooo hard because of the hot steamy sexual conversation I had with him... Hahaha! It was the funniest shit ever! <3 
Then I tried to take her home but I got lost and we ended up almost to Suffolk but it's okay because we had a lot of fun rapping in the car [You can do it put your back into it! I can do it put your ass into it]. We got to her house late and sat in the car wishing we had gone to dance at Time... damn it, we should have. Hehe.  
When I was coming home I saw B and it was sooo crazy because we were JUST talking about him! He was driving next to me yelling out the window then got behind me and flashed his brights and I didn't know who it was at first so I got kind of scared... then I saw it was him and called Jenny!
It was a great night. I didn't go to work today because I wasn't feeling too well. Tonight I'm working for my new job - Williamsburn Vacations. I really hope it's easy and fun. 
Oh yes, and I found some really cool hot boys that have boyfriend potential. Hehe."

"event","I may have just made the dumbest decision... 

I dropped my classes because I am way too stressed. When my parents find out they are going to be so angry. My reasoning behind dropping my classes is simple - I feel that if I do not get my shit together then I will not succeed in school. I am so stressed and that is affecting my school work. I do not want to get C's in college, I would like to get A's. I cannot be accepted to Nursing school with bad grades. =/
I am not financially stable at all and that is putting an extremely large amount of stress on me. I literally lose sleep because my nights are spent laying in bed worrying about everything. I used ot be extremely immature and irresponsible with my money and I spent every cent. I have matured now and I know that I want to save but I am so far behind that I feel I will never catch up and get to the point where I can start saving again. 

$225 phone bill
$230 express card
$500 visa card
$400 mastercard
$500 that i owe to my grandma
$225 car payment 
$150 to parents
$200 car insurance
and now about $900 to fix my car

There is no way I can go to school full-time and work enough to get all of this paid off. So the only logical thing for me to do is take a break from school, get a second job, and get all of my bills paid for. Then I will go back to school and work very hard, get A's, get my Nursing degree, and begin my career. 

I feel absolutely horrible right now but I have to do this so I can regain control of my finances... and regain control of my life. I have never been this stressed out.  

I need to calm down before I have an anxiety attack... or a heart attack."

saturday night sucked. we felt completely invisible, it took forever to get a drink and some food, and then i got really sick and had to go home because i had taco bell earlier in the day that effed up my stomach. 
sunday sucked... my car overheated twice and nathan had to get it towed for me. it is in his dad's shop now getting worked on and so far my bill is at $350. i hate my car. <b>i hate jeremiah for ruining my car.</b> i dyed my hair and messed it up so nathan took me to get it fixed. he is such a sweetie and he has really been there for me a lot. we have been hanging out much more and things are going really well. we are not ""official"" or whatever but i think we should be. 
last night i went to nathans and we had a pizza and watched some tv. i drank an entire bottle of wine and stayed up entirely too late. i had to be at work at 4am and i was exhausted all day. i came home and took a nap and when i woke up, i was groggy and super grumpy. instead of going to class, i somewhat cleaned the house and did some laundry. i hate living here. my brother is such a pig and living with him stresses me out so much. 
i really want to take a break from school and get a second job and just pay off all of my bills/debts and move out. then when i go back to school, i will not be all stressed like i am right now. i have sooo much stress and i have been really moody lately. i need a break from it all, i really do.

I was supposed to go out with Jenny last night and I was really, really looking forward to going out. I came home and decided to take a nap at two in the afternoon. Next thing I know I am waking up at 10:30pm all confused and shit. I called Jenny and not two minutes after I got off the phone with her, I was passed out again. I woke up around 8 this morning and I feel weird. I usually do not even get 18 hours combined in a week, so 18 in one night is a little overwhelming. 
My dad called and he wants a ""family meeting""... damn it. Basically, my brother and I will go over there and my parents will bitch at us about how we are doing everything wrong and how spoiled and unappreciative we are, when in reality it is my brother who is unappreciative, lazy, messy, etc. and I always get blamed. 
It is so ridiculous. It is days like this that I wish I could just go join the airforce and run away. 
Or maybe I am just fearing the worst and they're actually just going to see how we're doing. I know what I am getting in trouble for... money. They're going to tell me I owe them money for everything they've done for me lately - fixed my car, paid bills, etc. 
Fuck it. I'm going to their house with it all planned out to show them how much I make per paycheck and how I will pay them. I think showing up organized and prepared for the meeting will make me look better. Plus, if they start to gang up on me, I'll tell them my brother dropped all of his classes this semester. Bahahahaha... J/K... I'm not <i>that</i> big of a bitch, or am I? Naahhh...
I am nervous because I always fuck things up and my parents know it and they always point out what I do wrong. But lately I have not done anything wrong. I have busted my ass in school and work... so I am curious to see what they will find wrong in me this time. 

I just have to hide my tongue ring because that shit will piss them off. They'll start with the, ""That is so trashy and there you go spending your money on a piercing and blah blah blah."" 
Honestly, I got it pierced because that shit makes me happy and right now with all of the stress I am going through, I deserve to do something every once and awhile that makes me happy.

Then we went to Starbucks and got some coffee, then we ordered some pizza hut pizza, and went to his house to watch a movie. He kissed me and it felt nice.

I am in the worst mood right now. Grumpy as hell and I really do not know why. I suffer from the worst mood swings everrrr. Fuck, I am so tired right now. I need some sleep... or a drink or something. ;)
Jenny and I are going out Friday night. Yesssss!"

"event","bah... saturday night was pretty <b>crazy</b>. i almost took <strike>ecstacy</strike> but i decided not to. it would have been my first time rollin'. i took many shots of jager, drank many, many beers, went to the wave with some girls, danced like crazy, danced on stage, <b>hardcore made out</b> with a chick, drank even more, puked in another chicks car forcing her to pull over on the hampton roads bridge tunnel for me to puke some more, puked even more when i got back to her house, passed out drunk, and woke up at 8am when i was supposed to be at work at 6am. i had to call into work and tell them i was ill. <strike>fuck</strike>. it was super cool puking over the bridge into the water though. 
i was hungover all day and that night i went and had mexican food with my parents - big mistake. i puked some more. i worked sunday morning and then sunday evening i was lazy. i had work again today and my throat has been hurting. i think it is from throwing up... i really hope i am not getting sick. geez. 
jenny came over today and <i>we watched some sex</i>. bahaha. we watched the tommy lee and pamela anderson sex tape and it was so lame. she is very camera shy and kept covering up. jenny and i both agree that fake breasts are ugly. she looks like she has two giant melons glued to her. gross. and tommy lee was hairy. when he was not aroused his penis was very small and floppy but his shit got real big! as for the paris video, i was a little more interested in that one because i wanted to see her body. i am obsessed with skinny people and i wish i had her body - she is a damn twig. bones are hott. 
and as for rick soloman, his penis is very crooked, it looks like a damn rainbow or something. it was huge too, i would be so scared of that shiz. ouchie eew. 
i am skipping class tonight so i can study for thursdays anatomy lab exam. i also want to get to bed early because i have to wake up at 2:30am for work. damn, that's so super early. 
i dropped out of my statistics class because i could not handle the load. <strike>damn it</strike>.
warren has been on my mind a lot more lately. he just logged online right when i typed his name - how effin' weird. =/ a sign, maybe? *sigh*
i dyed my hair and the ends are darker. gooossshhhh. i am going to dye it again tomorrow - i hope it does not fall out. 
<i>i am extremely lonely.</i> casual sex is <b>definately not</b> what i want. i am craving passion, romance... and love. yes, i want a boyfriend. :("

"event","So it turns out that I'm not the only one that has crazy, random dreams. A girl I do not even know had this dream about me and it made me laugh when she told me about it. She seems really cool. This is what she wrote me...

<b>Heya, 
What's been going on? Not a whole lot around here. 
I just woke up really really confused. I just had a dream about you. lol Basically I drove all the way up there and I had friends with me and we basically just kinda sat around. Then you sat on my lap and I said that's probably not a good idea and you got upset and stormed away. Next thing I know there were people all over the place. You got lost in a crowd. Isn't that frickin' WEIRD? I don't talk to you all the time to be having dreams about you. lol I don't get it but ya, I thought I'd share with you. =) 
Have a good weekend!</b>

Anyway, I woke up this morning feeling pretty crappy but I still drove to work. When I got there, one of my coworkers said, ""Giirrrlll, you be lookin' rough dis mornin'!"" Haha. So I told her I didn't feel well and then my boss came up and saw how bad I looked and how bad I sounded when I was talking so he told me to go home and sleep. So I drove to Walmart and got some herbal tea, some honey, and some nyquil, then I went to Chickfila and got some breakfast. I ate, took some nyquil, and passed out. It's now almost 11 and I just had the most amazing nap everrrr. Now I remember why I absolutely LOVE nyquil and why I took it every single night last semester! LOL. I won't be doing that this semester though - it's bad for my liver and I already abuse my liver enough on Saturday nights. &hearts;
Soooo since I'm home sick, I'm going to do something constructive... CLEAN MY ROOM AND DO LAUNDRY!
Then I'm going to the library because I have to write a report about Anthrax. Then I'm going to my parents house to write my report and babysit their two little boys [baby chihuahuas] while they go to a dinner. I'm going to take it easy tonight because I feel terrible. Hopefully tomorrow I feel better so I can go out with Jennaynay!!!"

"event","woah i had another dream and this one was just as fucked up as the last. i was on some sort of vacation with my parents and jenny was there. we were all in this gigantic swimming pool and jenny and i were hanging out with some brazilian pop star. she wouldn't talk, she'd just sing everything. lol. 
all of a sudden we see alex trebek (the guy from jeopardy) and we swim over and i say, ""yo! alex, whud up!?  you're sportin' the mustache again! right on right on."" BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!! 
so we ask how he's doing and he said he's doing fine but he could be doing better and jenny says, ""2,000 bucks and we can make your day baby."" (hahahaha, wtf?) 
he said, ""noo, i can't do that.""
then the dream skips over to us in the mall and jenny said, ""ooh, look at these black clogs, soooo cute!""
and we started laughing. then we were running back to the pool and i was complaining that i had to wear jeans and a t-shirt to swim because i didn't have my bathing suit. 
so then we're back in the pool and jenny and alex tribet start making out on the stairs and he was making all these slurping noises while kissing her. then my mom swims over and she's like, ""hey hey! now none of that!"" and alex trebek got all embarrassed and felt like a loser and jenny started laughing all hardcore and yelling, ""BAHAHAHA! YOU FUCKING LOSER!! BAHAHAHA!"" and he swam away. 
what the hell? my dreams are entirely too weird for me. =/


i called in sick to work today because my throat kind of hurts and my voice is kind of going away. plus i wanted to sleep in a little more and i need to study for my exam tonight. bleh.

i got pretty drunk and then i met up with nate [hot white boy with the dreads] and we parked and smoked a fat blunt. i was high as a kite. when we were stopped at a stop light, he looked at me and said, ""what are you thinking about? you look deep in thought."" and i said, ""no, not deep in thought, i'm actually just enjoying the blinking lights."" haha. i was feeling so good and i was just staring at some blinking lights and it was so relaxing. haha. anyway, we decided to get a hotel room for the night (around 4am) and we started making out... one thing led to another... and <b>i got to tug on those hot dreads of his</b>. bahahaha. 
right now my voice sounds raspy and lower than usual. i think my throat may be a little irritated by the smoke. it sounds real sexy though, like a phone sex operators voice. oooolala. 
tonight's the super bowl and i have no clue what i'm doing. i'm probably just going to stay home and watch it here and go to sleep at a decent hour.

It was a silver coin and the center of it was gold and it had all these weird sexual positions on it. 
then when i left the theater, i was going to ride some weird rides and i saw some blonde girl that i knew (i have no idea who she is but she looked like a barbie doll with a lot of makeup) and i said hi. and she said, ""why are you going to say hi to me if you don't even call me. you could've told me you were coming so we could've came together."" and then she walked away and i said, ""fucking snob"" and then i walked away. then i went to a night club that was park of the amusement park and right when i entered and saw all the people dancing, i woke up.

"event","Last night was so much fun! Jenny and I have such great times when we go out because we have absolutely no drama. It is so freakin' great! We went to Jillians to visit Mary and then we met up with Buck and Brandon and we went to Wonderbar. And once again, we got <i>free drinks</i> all night long. <b>It's so great being us!</b> 
My friends Chris and Wes met us out there and it was soo awesome to see them again! Now that Chris is 21, he is all into the ""bar scene"" and lovin' it! haha.
While I was at Wonderbar, I went outside to answer my phone and almost witnessed a suicide! Some drunk Navy dude was hanging from a balcony saying he wanted to let go and die. I stood there amazed and wondered if he was really going to do it. Some people were yelling ""jump"" while others were yelling ""don't jump"". My curiosity was in full force and I just stood there wondering if I was going to see any brains splatter onto the street. But the cops came and took him away before he jumped. <i>Crazy shit.</i>
I have so much studying to do this week - I am so stressed! =/"

"event","last night when i was shaving my legs, i dropped the razor in the tub. i was not paying attention and while rinsing my hair, i stepped back and my left heel pressed right onto the razor. the sharp blades dug deep into my foot and took a chunk out. instead of freaking out because of the pain, i stood there watching the swirls of blood mix with the water and slip down the drain... am i sick and twisted or what?

today, my foot hurts. <3"

"event","i had a great day today. i thought i would be exhausted and cranky but i was not tired at all! work went well and i laughed so much. i work with this real cool old dude who looks exactly like martin lawrence... and acts like him too! he is hilarious and when he explains something, he will stare at me and then apologize and say, ""oh, i am so sorry for staring but your eyes are just so beautiful... i'm not hitting on you or anything."" he cracks me up.
there is another guy who works there who has his nose pierced and he said, ""so you are the new cute girl everyone is talking about!"" i just laughed. he seems cool too. actually, i like everyone i work with. they are all so funny, outgoing, and nice and my day passes by super fast. 
i got my new hours and i will be working 6am-12:30 and i am super excited. i will get 30 hours per week and i will be out of work by lunchtime! awesome. 
i really wanted to go out tonight but i am probably just staying in. i have math homework to do and i have to be up early tomorrow morning for math class. jenny and i are probably going to the bars tomorrow night. 
my stomach hurts - i think i may have food poisoning because this morning i made myself an eggsalad sandwich and i left it in my purse, in a drawer of a really hot office, and it was there all day. then when i got off work i ate it. how gross is that!? i feel ill."

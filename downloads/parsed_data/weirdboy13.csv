"event","I don't have a patriotic bone in my body.  I take absolutely no pride from saying that I am an American.  It doesn't make me special nor better than anyone else in the world, it is just a fact, a meaningless fact, like I have feet.  I take no pride from my job, at all.  If anything my pride is dashed lower every day by the fact that I work there.  What I do take pride from is the fact that I live so close to Portland.  I love Portland, fanatically, wholeheartedly, near obsessively love Portland.  Every time I see or hear reference to the place anywhere in the media I am filled with a little glee.  Portland is near perfect in my eyes, at least as perfect as a city can be.  There is crime, poverty, corruption, and every other varied and sundry problem inherent to any city.  Property prices are some of the most inflated above market sustainability in the nation.  Unemployment rates have been among the highest in the nation, if not the highest, for over a decade now.  Yet through all of that Portland is rated one of the most livable cities in the nation.  We are among the greenest (in both senses), most technically advanced, most conscientious, most tolerant cities in the nation.  Our food scene is world renowned, we are the most literate city in the nation, we have one of the highest percentages of college graduates; we are the micro-brew, organic produce, athletic shoe, alt-rock capital of the USA. Well, the organic produce is really a whole Northwest thing and L.A. produces more alt-rock bands but we produce more and better percapita.  We are also one of the fittest cities despite this world renowned food scene. Also very important is that there are more strip clubs in Portland than anywhere else is the country, not just percapita, in total.  It might even be the in the World at this point.  While I do not frequent strip clubs, it is comforting to know that there is enough freedom and free thinking in this city to allow this fact to be true.  From the McMenamin properties through the Washington Park Rose Garden, all the gardens, the underground, and Voodoo donut, this is a truly unique and wonderful city.  For all (or most) reasons to love Portland check out Chuck Palahniuk's Fugitives and Refugees. It is the definitive guide to everything Portland.  

Now, I write all of this having never actually lived in Portland.  I lived in Fairview, OR for a year, but never Portland. I was born and razed(spelling intentional) across the river in the tax haven/trailer park that is Vancouver, WA.  The thing is that I have never identified myself as being a Washingtonian.  Vancouver is merely where I slept, Portland is where I really lived.  For a large chunk of my education it is where I went to school, it is where I chose to spend my days, it is where most of my friends lived, it is where many, probably most of my happy memories were formed.  The happiest events of my life have taken place within Portland city limits.  My view of Portland is very much colored by the fact that I grew up across the river looking up to it, like a lost soul looking across to Paradise from the infernal side of the river Styx.  I so wanted to be over there was the fun and action was instead of on my side, where nothing was, that my admiration grew and grew.

P.S. 
On a semi-related note, I miss my furry children."

"event","Should I open a super hip laundromat?  My dad seems to think it could be a gold mine and would require very little time commitment after it got off the ground.  Both could be true, though the gold mine part is a bit doubtful.  It could be cool and we could make some descent money in time.  I have a plan as usual but my dad and I have had dozens of ideas and none have panned out quite yet.  Maybe this time."

Yes, that's right, a two for one special. Yippeeee!  So, Kelly and Tina, aren't you happy I finally updated with something?  I ask you two because I am pretty sure y'all are the only people who will ever read this.  If there are others please leave a comment and tell me so I know that maybe there is a reason to write other than for myself and two other people, one of whom I see on pretty much a daily basis.

I am a little surprised by this as I know very little of Chris Dodd and I think Kucinich is an elvin kook with no chance to get anywhere near winning and therefore a waste of a vote.  I like Barack.  He is not perfect we don't agree on everything but he is as close as I can find in someone who actually has a chance of leading this country.  Oh, and fuck Ron Paul. Bizarre space case psycho elf."

"event","I have started to write something here roughly 12 times in the last 30 days and each time I stop for a while in the middle and then decide to scrap the whole thing as I have lost the will to move on with whatever it was I meant to write or just don't find it very interesting anymore.  The basic gist if what I keep writing down is basically that I am profoundly unhappy with my life and damn near everything in it.  I hate where it is going, my job is sucking my soul and I can no longer find much that makes me happy for long.  The massive black void in my soul can no longer be patched by buying new toys or other brief and superfluous distractions, it has grown far too deep for that.  Not much interests me anymore except trying to find something that does.  My search for happiness seems to have stalled yet again, not that it was ever really going anywhere but I can no longer delude myself into seeing progress where there is absolutely none.  I have wanted my whole life to experience more, contribute more, be more, have more than anyone else, never waste a second savor each moment life gives me and never take anything for granted and yet, as the cruel irony of the universe goes, I waste more time than I can even fathom.  As far as I am concerned I waste almost all my time.  My job is a waste of time and effort and as previously mentioned is sucking the soul form more and more every minute.  I want so damn much and produce so damn little.  I need real, true, profound meaning in my life, nothing else will do.  I want to build something, create something, change the universe, there is no word for the depths that I want to matter.  Not a self important prideful sort of matter, more a I did something to help the universe, I justified my existence and then some, I actually have higher meaning sort of matter.  Everyone wants to know the meaning of life, I urn, cry out, every fiber of my being begs as hard as a fiber can beg to the point of simultaneous implosion and explosion for some fucking meaning.
I want so much.
I want so much but I can bring my self to do so little.  I have little to no clue how to reach my goals, worst of all I am not even sure what my goals are yet.  I can not seem to change, I can not seem to get anything in gear, I don't know how to get over this hurdle that keeps me from finding what I so desperately need to find.  At this point I just don't know where to go, what to do, or how to do it.  I am stumped and I need that to end. 
26. 26. 26.  How the fuck did I make it to almost 26 with this little to show for it.  I have without really being fully aware of it stalled for years.  I have very little to show for my life, at least by my standards it is very, very little.  I have grown complacent, another member of the walking dead that mostly populate this world."

"event","I have been searching for direction and meaning in my life for years and at times think I am getting closer to finding it.  I found a direction but I seem to have taken a detour down some ghetto ally that is leading me to crack house row.  I am an assistant manager at Burgerville, a far better job than Bellagios but still about as satisfying as drinking sand in the Sahara.  It is not what I want to be doing, I have far far far higher asperations than to work in fast food with the dregs, dross, insane, and stupid.  I am like a broken record, I keep saying essentially the same thing over and overagain but it remains to be true none the less.  I feel destined for extreme greatness and right now I am floating somewhere around mildly mediocre.  I have great ambitions still but am not sure what to do with them,  I just know that what I am doing now isn't it.  So now, once again, I am looking for a change, something that will finally satisfy me, something I can look forward to doing everyday and feel good about when I leave everynight.  I really want to own my own business or my own destiny, work for myself, make money while I sleep.  But mainly I just want to be happy and satisfied, finally feel like I am not wasting my life all the time.

"event","I can see why the general suicide rate is so high around the holiday season.  It really is the perfect time to reflect on the year that has past and all the years before it and where you fit into the grand scheme of things and how your life has progressed and how you have enriched the life of others and then deside it has amounted to one big pile of shit and it is time to abort because obviously something has gone terribly wrong and continuing now would be utterly fruitless and futile.  Not that I have reached that point or ever will.  I am tenacious and wish to live forever, though my life is amounting to a big steaming pile of shit, but it has been headed in that general direction for quite some time.  Kelly is the only acheivement I derive any pride from, I can't even write a decent sentance, as is demonstrated by the mother of all run ons above.  And yes I count her as an achievment as I have not driven her away yet and hopefully never will or my first few sentances may seem more relevent.  Now is the time of year for looking back on old friends and catching up.  Now is the time of year to see where you stand in the grand scheme of things.  In the grand globel scheme I am at the top of the world by the vurtue of being born in this country to the parents I have.  However, it seems since my birth I have done most everything in my power to slowly fuck up any head start in the race of life I may have enjoyed. I mean I never did drugs, I never dropped out of school, I am a college graduate, but so what.  I lack whatever small spark it may take to actually stay ahead or atleast it still lies dormant.  After 25 years I am still all dreams and no follow through.  I squandered my potential at every chance until it started to leave me.  Or atleast hide.  I need more, alot more, infinitely more than what I have provided myself, which is nothing, and it is hard to build on nothing.  Nothing builds desperation, as anything in comparison seems great.  Desperation leads to settling and I refuse to settle.  In my estimation I am three years behind where I needed to be to call my life good or on track.  I am living on the fumes of a charmed childhood and with every passing day the fumes get thinner and my existance more pathetic.  I have also become a broken record as atleast a fourth to a half of all my posts deal with the subject of my unhappiness with the course and progress of my life.

Here is my Christmas wish:  Success, Achievement, Direction, and Drive.  Only then can I claim some semblence of a life.  World peace and an end to hunger would be nice too.  

Enough.

Merry Christmas everyone!"

"event","I can hear the highway calling, want to drive around the bend, need to get out of Cannon and not go back again, but I'm stuck in Cannon prison and I can't go on, 'cuz' I hate that fuckin' hellhole and it I want to bomb.
It is a very pretty hellhole though, but I just do not enjoy it down there much.  Every week when it is almost time to drive back I get this feeling like I am sauntering my way back to prison or some work camp.  It is like purgatory, all the wonders of Heaven dangled in front of you without being able to enjoy any of them.  I should be enjoying myself, the work isn't hard, the hours are good, pretty setting, but every minute of it feels like my soul is being pried from my body, either that or slowly dying within.  It provides me no joy, it provides me nothing in fact.  It has made me stoic, I feel nothing there but a hint of ennui, I am as an empty vessel, just existing nothing more, nothing less.  It really is like prison, I am serving my time until I am released and just counting down every minute until that time.  Also like prison I don't know what comes after this or if I can transition into the outside world.  Am I leaving one prison only to enter another else where?  Am I going to once again float in the purgatory that is my life, directionless, lost, and scared.  I am very scared right now.  I do not know what happens next, all I know is that it has to be something different.  Life is to be enjoyed and I am not enjoying myself much and haven't for years really.  There have been moments of great enjoyment and blissful fun, profound moments of joy so meaningful and perfect.  But the specter of an uncertain future always spikes the joy and brings it down a notch or two.  Every time I am having fun I eventually stop and think ""oh, ya, this can't last, all good things must end and there is so much uncertainty ahead of me and the struggle will begin again soon"".  Little makes me happy any longer, Kelly does, being home is a welcome relief from the pit that is my day to day life on the coast, but I always know that I must go back, that something will stand in the way of my happiness.  A friend of mine once said that maybe I was not meant to be happy, because I never really was and at the time the statement shocked me but at the same time it made sense.  I feel little but failure most of the time, I want so much and have done so little and with every passing day my dreams seem farther away and duller.  The talents I know I once possessed I squandered and they seem to want to leave me out of neglect.  I know what I want but I don't know how to get it, or I think I know what I want.  I want so many things and most of my wants are now compromises of what I formerly wanted.  I need to be happy and I need to find something that makes me happy, this is the greatest goal I have.  I need to feel fulfilled.  I need more than a job, I need a way that I can make money having fun.  Life is too short to be bored or unhappy for a minute.  Life is to short to entertain a job you don't like for even a second.  I know better now what I don't want but the details of what I do want elude me still.  I want, no, need to wake up every morning and be excited to go to work, hell I don't even want to call it work, I want to play for a living.  The definition of play here is quite broad,  many people play for a living, because play is just doing something you enjoy.  I had more than one professor in college that referred to what they did as play because they loved to teach and it filled them with joy to do it.  It fulfilled them and made them proud to be who they were, they went to bed every night with a sense of accomplishment and excitement for the following day.  That is what I want, that is what I need to find, that is as close to the meaning of life as it comes, love what you do, whatever you do, make a difference, love yourself, love others, and be loved.  If you have that you have everything and a lot to be proud of. 

On a lighter note Happy 10 months Kelly!!!  I love you very much."

"event","I am not very good at updating even though I want to, this is made much worse now by the fact that I have no internet connection most of the week when I actually have things to say.  I have thought about writing down my thoughts so that I remember them later but I never feel like updating when that later comes anyhow.  I like the beach but I don't like living at the beach or working at the Wayfarer, I don't like being just far away enough from everyone I give a damn about to only be able to see them maybe two days a week.  I feel very disconnected there, which I think is what appeals to so many people about being there, it is an escape, but really don't want to escape right now, I want to be in the thick of things, I want to connect.  I am glad to have an externship but I will also be glad to get it over with because instead of feeling like a step towards creating and furthering a life for myself it feels like I am putting my life on hold, exiling myself to a beautiful hell, the most sinister type.  It is many of the things I love mixed with most of the thiongs I hate.  It feels like dying of thirst while sitting on the edge of an oasis, or a more apt example, being the palace wipping boy, beautiful surroundings, bad situation.  The coast is it's own little isolated world and many of it's inhabitants seen to be ignorant of the outside world, it is like fucking Deliverance sometimes, just a huge mass of some of the dumbest rednecks I have ever met.  A fourth of the town is quite wealthy, half are dirt poor and half brain dead, and another fourth are tourists who get to enjoy the scenery without having to endure the soul crushing stupidity of the majority of locals.  I like the ocean, I like the sand, I like the birds, I like the rocks, I love the sunsets, but I hate everything else, especially the people, which is bad when you are working in a people based buisness."

Your number is: 3

The characteristics of #3 are: Expression, verbalization, socialization, the arts, the joy of living.

The expression or destiny for #3:

You also have the destiny to sell yourself or sell just about any product that comes along. You are imaginative in your presentation, and you may have creative talents in the arts, although these are more likely to be latent. You are an optimistic person that seems ever enthusiastic about life and living. You are friendly, loving and social, and people like you because you are charming and such a good conversationalist. Your ability to communicate may often inspire others. It is your role in life to inspire and motivate; to raise the spirits of those around you.

The negative side of number 3 Expression is superficiality. You may tend to scatter your forces and simply be too easygoing. It is advisable for the negative 3 to avoid dwelling on trivial matters, especially gossip.

Your Soul Urge number is: 6

A Soul Urge number of 6 means: 
With a number 6 Soul Urge, you would like to be appreciated for your ability to handle responsibility. Your home and family are likely to be a strong focus for you, perhaps the strongest focus of your life. Friendship, love, and affection are high on your list of priorities for a happy life. You have a lot of diplomatic tendencies in your makeup, as you a able to rectify and balance situations with an innate skill. You like working with people rather than by yourself. It is extremely important for you to have harmony in your environment at all times. 

The positive side of the 6 Soul Urge produces a huge capacity for responsibility; you are always there and ready to assume more than your share of the load. If you possess positive 6 Soul Urges and express them, you are known for your generosity, understanding and deep sympathetic attitude. Strong 6 energy is very giving of love, affection, and emotional support. You may have the inclination to teach or serve your community in other idealistic ways. You have natural abilities to help people. You are also likely to have artistic and creative leanings. 

If you have an over-supply of 6 energy in your makeup, you may express some of the negative traits common to this number. With such a strong sympathetic attitude, it is easy to become too emotional. Sometimes the desires to render help can be over done, and it can become interfering and an attitude that is too protective, rather than helpful. The person with too much 6 energy often finds that people tend to take advantage of this very giving spirit. You may tend to repress your own needs so that you can cater to the demands from others. At times, there may be a tendency in this, for becoming over-loaded with such demands, and as a result become resentful.

Your Inner Dream number is: 7

An Inner Dream number of 7 means: 
You dream of having the opportunity to read, study, and shut yourself off from worldly distractions. You can see yourself as a teacher, mystic, or ecclesiastic, spending your life in the pursuit of knowledge and learning."

"event","A stutter is not deficiency, as some see it, but rather an abundance; it is a raging torrent of information jammed at the ever narrowing door way. It is stacatto but never retardo. It is content built upon content until the weight of the words crushes the tongue and the memes of meaning fall like hastily stacked china and break at the opening that held their freedom. It is a trip, an action, a bump in the sidewalk when you are running late for work.  It is the skinned knee or the broken arm of communication, a momentary hindrance to the fluid motion of the body.  It is the skip of a record, the jam of a tape.  It is an action, an event, a moment of substance so thick that it jams the cogs and wheels halting the automata in mid expression leaving it to finish as the gears grind and stick.  A stutter is a tangible weight tugging at the flesh and bone of the mouth; I can feel it, I can taste it, I can roll it around in my mouth, but as hard as I try I can never just spit it out."

"event","So, as the Subject header would indicate, the stutter has finally gotten to me.  By gotten to me I mean that at last it bothers me.  I never really took much notice of it for years, minor inconvenience at worse, good excuse for not liking public speaking and a scape goat if a presentation did not go well.  It served a purpose at least.  Not until my father made me get the Speecheasy did I even really think about it as much of an issue.  Even then it was more his problem than mine but on the advice of two speech therapists I submitted to getting it.  I figured that it could help in those rare social situations that... well all social situations as at that time being at all social was very rare.  I thought I might me be going to law school and it would certainly help there.  Well, law school didn't happen and I have worn the ""gnome"", as I like to call it, out of the house maybe three times.  
Today though it started to bother me.  It occurred to me, and not for the first time but more profoundly, that it has a tendency to undermine me.  I illicit not respect but patient pity with my words.  No matter the seriousness of what I have to say the stutter will lessen it.  How am I to garner any respect with those I work with or give instructions to my future employees if I sound like fucking Porky Pig.  Reprimanding an employee could become an exercise in futility if they can not understand me or do not respect my words because I stuttered.  Never will I be able to reply with an angry ""did I stutter?"" when someone does not understand my directions because yes indeed I did stutter.  I lack the verbal eloquence to say the many things I would like to or with the inflection I want to, because it will not come out right and that is frustrating beyond belief.  Having a teacher ask you if you wish to opt out of a class exercise is degrading because it insinuates that you lack some ability the others posses.  I am not sure if it was due to the stutter or if he just thinks I am an idiot, but I do not want him pitifully asking me if a simple exercise is too much for me.  FUCKING A no it is not.  I posses no deficiency that would preclude me from any academic exercise and it is humiliating to suggest I do."

I am very intolerant of many of the traits I find in my self in others; awkward sentence but you get the point.  I say things with every intention of making them happen only to fail, not everything but enough that it pisses me off.  Though, my general lack of assertiveness is my main point of frustration at this point.  As the weeks go on, the more I find to loath about myself."

"event","To state the obvious, I do not update this thing very much any longer.  Why you ask?  Well, I have never really updated it that much save a month or two period.  But, I feel like I should write in here more, like it might help me to put things into writing.  It is also a way to prove to myself that I am still capable of forming a cogent sentence.  So, what is going on in my life?  Last week I started a new rotation at ""school"".  I like the two new classes, Marketing and Restaurant and Hospitality Management, but I am not sure that they like me.  I have not had the best start to them, in fact the start has been pretty poor indeed.  So much I need to do.  I have finally become the absolutely blithering idiot I was always afraid I would become.  I am not sure what the cause of this sudden onset of profound stupidity is but I don't like it and would be most thankful if it went away.  ugh.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  Serious fucking issues.  I am getting fatter too, 12.5 pounds in the last 7 weeks.  That could have something to do with the stupidity.  Kelly keeps telling me that I need to exercise but resist her suggestions; though, I do know that she is right and I desperately need to get in better shape and quick.  Today is National Punctuation Day; I hope that I have used my punctuation correctly.  I have become lazier recently too, which though a seeming impossibility, is none the less true.  I can not will myself to do anything any longer.  Getting out of bed is an ordeal.

I still love you Kelly, over six months and counting.  Gosh, what a catch I am."

I have been meaning to update pretty much everyday for the last two weeks or so but never seem to actually do it.  Mainly, I think, because the first things that come to my mind are very negative ones lately. I have my share of good ones lately too, but they are mostly spiked with the bad thoughts, and I don't want to dwell on the bad.  So, I will not dwell, just briefly mention.  I have more work to do by next week than I have time in the day to get done it seems, though it will all work out fine, and I lack a resolute raison d'etre.  I have Kelly, so the first part of my plan to justify my existence is complete, but I have quite a few steps to go and will be mostly miserable until I achieve at least a large part of my plan.  The next part of my plan is a steady stream of money and an enjoyable and fulfilling source of this steady stream.  I need something productive to do.  NOW!  A place of my own is a step in the right direction as well, a very nice step, hopefully that all works out.  More explanation you say?  Not now, now is sleepy time."

"event","I am afraid after only three days, my Human Resource Management class is already sucking my will to live.  I most definitely see the point of the course, at least in theory, but I am having certain difficulties with the presentation of the material.  I like Peggy, she seems very nice, but I am having the same somewhat irrational reaction to her that another classmate of mine, Amy, had to our Wine studies and Beverage instructor.  There is also the unfortunate fact that Peggy reminds me greatly of one of my sociology professors in college and she proved to be over time one of the biggest idiots I have ever encountered in academia.  Now, don't get me wrong, I do not think that Peggy is an idiot, just that she has rather striking similarities in voice, appearance, and general speech pattern as the aforementioned insipid half-wit.  Though, I was still quite fond of my sociology professor, she was a very sweet lady, she just had the intellectual fortitude of a dung beetle.  I am also not in agreeince with many of the concepts presented in class so far, but I do not necessarily consider that a bad thing, we are there to learn the instructors conception of the subject and gleam from it a personally usable truth.  I have learned alot of valuable things from people I did not fully, or at times even partially, agree with.  Whatever my be the problem, and it may very well just be me or some attention deficiency I may posses, this rather simplistic class is sucking whatever energy I have right out of me.  This leads to the other related though slightly more serious problem, my apparent inability to stay conscious in a class room 
where computers are present.  I think I may actually like accounting a bit, at the very least, I don't think I do or will hate it.  It actually presents an opportunity to think again and that is fantastic, I would love to be challenged to work and deduce again.  For this reason I MUST STAY AWAKE.  It is unfair to myself to take for granted my education so, and especially something as important as money management.

Update:
I was wrong, she is a blithering fucking idiot and it completely boggles the mind how anyone could ever hire her to teach anything other than being a drooling airhead and as contrary as something very contrary indeed."

It has been a rediculously long time since I posted anything here of any real subsatance, and it is not because I had nothing to write about, in fact, I have had tons to write about but write I did not, lack of will or something of the sort.  I really need to write things down while they are still fresh in my head and not put them off forever, heck, just in general I need to stop putting things off.  I just got distracted by my restaurant contract, or is this the distraction, ya, that is more likely.  Lost my train of thought, not that I really had one to begin with. I am going to be very happy when I get out of this school and can get on with my life, start a career, feel like I am doing something.  I have alot to say but have pretty much lost the will to say it right now, I will probably update again in the morning when I will feel like typing more."

I still haven't seen the frickin' movie.  That bothers me a bit.  Star Wars is a very important part of my life and the fact that I have not seen the last installment in the series yet is grinding at me as I will not really have time to see it now for another week or two.  What a horrible thought.  I must find a way to see it soon, very soon, before I blow up a planet in aggravation.  The power of the force is strong, it is pulling me to the theater."

I have invested in super glue for you in case your shriveled and dried old limbs should crack and fall off, least I could do, really.  Some time your going to have to tell me what it was like to have to compete for resources with the dinosaurs, must have been fun having all those big lizards around.

"event","I waited on the first tables of my life today in Bleu, my schools little restaurant thingy.  I was rather apprehensive at first, as I have never really done anything like this before and wasn't sure what to expect, but everything turned out great.  It is alot of work and a bit stressful but all-in-all it was alot of fun in the end.  My tables were very understanding of the fact that they were my first ever, they were very gentle in my restaurant service deflowering and I appreciate that.  One table did contest their bill saying that they had received the wrong bottle of wine and would therefore, after drinking the whole thing, not pay for it.  I showed them the bottle before opening it and made sure that it was the exact one they ordered, they said yes, that it was exactly what they wanted, so I pour away and they drank away and then upon seeing their bill decide they didn't really want to spend that much on wine, so we gave them their $7 back.  I got a small lecture on wine service detailing to me all the things I should have done, to ensure that this never happened again, and conveniently enough, they were all the things I did in the first place, how helpful to know that I am right and yet so wrong at the same time.  Apart from that one slight hiccup and some other very minor misunderstandings and missteps, it was excellent, much better than I had anticipated.  Rather energizing to have a purpose.  I think I like this working thing, even if it is for free.  Though, it is also quite exhausting, and I was only doing it for 3 1/2 hours with only three tables of two, I am not yet sure how anyone does this all day with multiple tables and turnovers.  Hard on the feet aswell.  But I'll say it once again, it was actually alot of fun.
The biggest downside to this new schedule is, of course, the fact that I lose my mornings and brief after class together time with Kelly.  I had grown quite accustomed to picking her up in the morning and taking her back home in the evening before she went to work.  It was very sad today parking without her in the seat next to me. We don't really get any good time together during the week now, it is all in class, and while that is still nice, it is certainly not the same and just leaves me feeling all the more frustrated because I get a bit of class time, which sort of counts as half time, because she is there next to me, but we have to pay attention to the instructor and while, like I said, it is still nice, it like a small taste, a glimpse, a wicked tease of her that just leaves me wanting so much more, our class time together is like an a appetizer with no entree to follow, it whets my appetite without any hope to sate it.

Love you.  Miss you."

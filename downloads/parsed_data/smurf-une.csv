"event","So after 117 weeks without writing anything I decided to get off my arse and do something about it.

Let's see, ""recap of the travels of the Smurf for the last 2 years"" might be useful...  I broke up with my girlfriend of many years, and changed jobs in quick succession.  I then get a new girlfriend and job quickly thereafter.  I get an offer of my dream job and quit my old job to pursue it.  New girlfriend cheats on me and we break up.  Then I travel along in single land for 2 years, yes entirely single not even going on a date!!!  Dream job goes to hell and is a major drag and I'm not paid nearly enough to deal with the shit.  

So current events include new girlfriend and job hunting so that I can tell the 4% pay increase I was offered (which I believe is insulting) to go away.

Yeah so that's the recap and I promise LJ with the goat as my witness that I will update more often.  Plus I have internet again now and I'm under strict instructions not to get addicted to WOW or I'll be looking for a new girlfriend.

Toodles noodles."

"event","<p>So have been sick the last few days.  Anyone who's been around me for an extended period of time will say it's because i'm stressed.  Bah.</p>
<p>So anyway the gorgeous Miss Chelle is coming to visit tomorrow.  Yay!  Drunken debauchery, gluten free food and angry music of the indy punk persuasion.  Oh yeah and we have to visit a fetish club while she's here too.  :)  So much excitement, so bouncy.  Hot chick.  *drools*</p>
<p>Otherwise not much is happening in the world.  Must work over the public hols, but that's okay by me 2.5 times my normal wage makes me happy.  Then I can go and play.  YAY!</p>
<p>Must be off, I have new icons to fiddle with and reading to do.  Will update again later....</p>"

"event","<p>So it's been a while since I last updated.  I just want to point out that this is due to the fact that I have been working heaps over Commonwealth Games and school holidays.  Thankfully thoough the little shits down here only get 4 days off over Easter, so that will be heaps ace.</p>
<p>I applied for a job the other day.  Did my interview, hopefully it went well I should find out in the next few days.  I think that I don't want to take it because my boss is super ace and gave me time off to go to the interview.  I mean how many bosses would do that?!  The boss lady and I had a date last night to talk about everything.  It was good.  There were ribs with JD sauce.  *drools*  And bufalo wings.  *sigh*  So yummy!!</p>
<p>After dinner we did the whole movie thing.  Went and saw <i>'When A Stranger Calls'</i>.  It was less crap than I thought it would be, so I was kind of impressed.  It was the kind of thing where you go to the movies expecting it to be total arse waste and are then pleasently surprised when it's not as tragic as you thought it would be.</p>
<p>So my plans for today are to go to bass ladies and watch <i>'She's the Man'</i> or <i>'V for Vandetta'</i>.  It will be heaps fun.  I still have to watch the last episode of season 1 <i>Prision Break</i>.  I'm totally addicted to that show.  There are a heap of new shows out in the states atm that look kinda cool.  Must look and see what we could be getting here sometime.</p>
<p>Anyways, must be off.  Hope everyone is well.  Ciao`.</p>"

"event","<p>So had the day off work today, and of course I have been sick as.  Why not?!  It's always the way these things work.  But hopefully I will feel somewhat better tomorrow.  I plan on killing whatever is making me feel unwell by coding a web page because it will entertain me and I haven't done one for a while.  It should be fun and keep me out of mischief for the time being at least.  Which for the safety of everyone is a good thing.</p>
<p>Pride March happened on Sunday.  I missed the parade because of work, but the party was heaps fun.  Went to the gardens, watched some of the entertainment, went to the POW and generally enjoyed myself muchly.  Would have been great to see the parade because by all accounts it was really good.  It was muchly fun to play spot the breeder and peer intently at them until they run away scared.  Only did that twice, but I must admit it is a very fun game.  :)</p>
<p>Otherwise not much to say really, just thought I should update seeing I have been somewhat interesting this week, compared to my usual <i>'do nothing but work'</i> self.</p>
<p>Anyways, best be off.  Web pages to code.  Geek like I must be....</p>"

"event","<p>So it's been a while since I updated.  Though because all I have done sinc my last update is work I really don't have much of interest to say.</p>
<p>I am SO tired. not just from school hols and working all the time.  I ACTUALLY went out on Saturday night to the POW.  It was heaps good until one of the girls had her drink spiked and then I spent 4 + hours in emergency with her.  But not only was it shit that she had her drink spiked, but the reason we were out was because it was her farwell from work drinks.  Massively shitty.  I think the crazy guy who wouldn't piss off spiked the drink.  The guy was in a gay pub trying to get the women to chew gum and put it in his hair, because he thought that it would wash out with conditioner... WTF?!?!?  So his weird and wouldn't fuck off-ness makes him the drink spiker.  So sayeth I!</p>
<p>Anyway not much else is news.  Am going to hang out with boss lady tomorrow to watch the end of season 1 and the first few eps of <i>""Supernatural""</i>.  So that should be fun, so long as she doesn't invite workmates that are pissing me off. Otherwise there may be blood shed.  Or at least hair pulling and eye gouging....</p>
<p>Am going to go and visit Miss Chelle soon.  Because she said I must.  Plus she found some of my mail that went to Armidale instead of Melbourne.  A common mistake I'm sure.  I mean they're SO similar and the postcodes are like so almost the same!</p>
<p>Anyways, am off to have some lunch and find chaos to create for my own entertainment.  Hope everyone is well.  Come visit and entertain me all you slackers that haven't come to melbourne yet.  Later.</p>"

"event","So it's been a while since I last updated.&nbsp; Much has
happened.&nbsp; Work Christmas party.&nbsp; Much fun, alcohol and
foolishness.&nbsp; Took my boss as my date, she even wore a dress for
me (apparently!).&nbsp; She's a great date, we had an ace time.&nbsp;
Laughed far too much to be healthy I'm sure.&nbsp; :)<br>
<br>
Christmas came and went.&nbsp; It was okay.&nbsp; Spent the day with
boss lady and Kate (workmate), along with boss lay's boy and Jen and
Paul (crazy gay man, ex bosses brother).&nbsp; It was a very work like
do, but much fun all the same.&nbsp; Played the new Trivial Pursuit
DVD, had much fun.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; It has a huge amount of
Australian content.&nbsp; Speaking of which, the actor that plays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">'Susan'</span> on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neighbours</span> is a lesbian as everyone knows, but she's also Irish and puts the Aussie accent on for the show and my boss knows her.&nbsp; I <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">SO</span> want to be introduced!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; <font style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-weight: bold;"" size=""4"">Squee-tastic!&nbsp; </font><font style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"" size=""4""><font size=""3""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">I so am lame!<br>
<br>
Anyway, there is nothing excitement planned for New Years.&nbsp; Am
thinking of hanging out with the boss and Kate after we all finish work
at eleven.&nbsp; Watch the firworks and then sleep before I have to
start work again on New Years Day at 9.... <font style=""color: rgb(204, 51, 204);"" size=""5"">UGH!</font><br>
<br>
Today is my day off so I am bludging, in amongst doing work.  It's
quite nice really. Had an argument with the boss over the phone
and have been drinking ever since.&nbsp; Maybe I should stop taking our
difference of opinions to heart.&nbsp; But that smacks of effort
because then I'd have to stop giving a shit about her. So
whatever.I will figure it out sooner or later..<br>
<br>
So yeah not much to report. Got a mad DS for Chrissy.&nbsp; Am
now thinking bout whether I should get a 360 or a PS 3. Any
suggestions?! <br>
<br>
Anyway I'm getting drunk, so I'm off to stare blankly at a wall. Enjoy your day all.<br>

'Dale.&nbsp; Much fun was had on both occasions.&nbsp; My birthday
though is not worth rambling - all that needs to be said is that there
was mud cake...&nbsp; So very chocolate!!<br>
<br>
Anyway in the 'Dale I went to the Servies to meet up with <b>Ras</b> and <lj user=""croutons"" />
and ended up meeting Beau as well.&nbsp; So yeah we drank cocktails and
then beer and were joined by Chelle.&nbsp; Then we went to the Newie -
it was so funny, so many memories of first year!&nbsp; So then I spoke
to <lj user=""philbert83"" />
for ages which was fun.&nbsp; Then saw Jedi, Sam, Justin (crazy as a
coconut!) and Sally.&nbsp; It's really funny being back in a place so
small that you know just about everyone.&nbsp; And they still do that
crazy lockout thing- HA!&nbsp; I actually at one point said <i>""How quaint.""&nbsp; </i>I think I was getting a bit drunk so I was being a bit foolish.<br>
<br>
I did however get up and to my meeting by 9am.&nbsp; No hangover.&nbsp;
I think it's too damn cold in Armidale to get hangovers!&nbsp; Anyway
the meeting was entertaining, mostly because I was sitting between the
PVC Research/ Dean of the Sciences and the Dean of Arts and close
enough to the Chair of Academic Board to hear what she was
saying.&nbsp; Highly entertaining!<br>
<br>
So yes I had a mucho funno time playing with everyone in the 'Dale and
it must happen again soon.&nbsp; Either that or everone should come to
Melbourne for Christmas....&nbsp; You know you want to!!!<br>

"event","<p>WHOOT!  Girlbar is on tonight.  Bouncyness will be happening all day me thinks.  Chelle and myself are talking about going.  She isn't keen on the idea, me bouncing off walls.  Maybe that was all that coffee though?!  Girlbar for those not in the know is a lesbian party (not exclusive, but guys are not there in large numbers) that happens once a month in St Kilda at the Prince of Wales (my pub of choice!).  The Prince of Wales is already inhabited by cute girls, but on girlbar nights - <b>SO MUCH</b> cuteness.</p>
<p>Anyway, not much else to say at the mo, so will go and do something productive.  Later muffins...</p>"

"event","<p>So yes, haven't updated for a while, so in theory I should have something interesting to write.  Don't hold your breath though!</p>
<p>Yes, Chelle is in Melbourne so we are going to play with her for a bit before she heads back to the 'Dale.  She is supposed to be looking through microfilm, but she <b>SO</b> wants/needs to go and look at the shinyness that is this wonderful city.</p>
<p>Caught up with Miki P over the weekend.  YAY!  He is coming to live down here in 3 weeks, so then there will be many more MP parties and trashbagging around South Yarra.  He is well, he came to find me at Luna Park and then of course the rumor was that I was switching teams and doing naughty things with the cute guy.  You have to laugh.  The rumor was made worse when he found me because he yells, <i>""Lover!  How the fuck are you?""</i>  Ha, ha.  Some people need a hobby.</p>
<p>Queer Film Festival launch is tonight.  I am told by one of the organisers that it is going to be really good.  So I might meander down and see what is happening a bit later in the festival.</p>
<p>Have the weekend off from work because I was supposed to be headed to the 'Dale for a Union board meeting, but my mum is coming to visit.  But I am going up there next week anyway for a Uni Council meeting and Strategic Planning session.  I am really looking forward to seeing my mum, it'll be fun.  She wants to go to Ballarat over the weekend because one of the women she works with told her it was pretty.  I think I shall have to enforce my rule of <i>""if the tram doesn't go there, then neither should you!""</i>  Although I think I may have to waver on that one a bit or she may decide that I'm a suburb snob.</p>
<p>Anyway I have been up since some sparrow-fart hour this morning.  Things are mostly done, but I decided to chill out for 5 - 10 before I crack it completely at something.  Lack of sleep is not your friend...  I went out to the queerbie pub around the corner last night and then couldn't get away from the girl I met up with until well after 12mn.  Sleep, sweet, sweet sleep... real soon precious!</p>
<p>I hear that there's a UNESA meeting this weekend.  Should be interesting.  The lefties will be up the creek without a paddle this year.  The worst part is that, in fucking the Libs with prefferences at election Petie-pie delt himself out of an exec spot.  I think he would have been good on exec, but can't do anything about it now I guess.</p>
<p>So yeah that's about everything I think.  Should go and shower and get organised.  Toodles all....</p>"

I also met a heap of Home and Away people, Killing Heidi, Millsy and heaps more including McLeods Daughters people.  So very fun.</p>
<p>Other than that I have been working heaps.  Making lots of money so I can pay my tax, Whoot!  Anyways, jmitche4's mum has been here staying with us and that has been good.</p>

It is SO hot here, but it induces weight loss - then I can be a sexy biatch and all will swoon over me.  :p  Perhaps not, but I am trying to be positive about the heat rather than taking up residence in a bell tower over the whole matter.</p>
<p>Other than the heat and lack of squishy-ness I have been having a blast.  The last 2 days I have had morning massages, very tough life I know!  Also been on the beach and swimming and playing heaps of pool at my Pops place.  Am going for drinks with Evil-bevil to the Sailing Club this afternoon.  Should be pretty cool.</p>
<p>The plans for tomorrow currently are to go fishing and try and get some doggie mackrel in the morning and then spending the afternoon lazing around on the beach at Great Kepple Island.  Holidays are hella fun, especially when you don't have to go to work. :D</p>
<p>Anyway should go and do something fun like cocktails at the resort by the pool.  Enjoy your holidays muffins, and Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>P.S Anyone stuck for something to do on New Years should come to Melbourne.  Luna Park is putting on a mad gig Tenacious D, Killing Heidi, etc.  Staff get in for free and get major discounts for friends and family.</p>"

<p>Not only that, but we're having live coverage of the US Election count.  So excited - Yes I am lame enough to get all bouncy over watching election coverage.  Not only are we getting the coverage, but Kerry is looking good currently.  He's up 77 to 66, for those that don't know the winner will need 270 to be elected, so plenty of counting to go, but it's looking good early.

<p>Not much else has happened, I hear the UNESA council next year looks like the Libs vs the Queers. Should be interesting. I can't be blamed because I didn't even vote, although I will say that I did number the ballot and I put the UNE version of Alexander Downer (read: sniffling, whinggy, private schooled, cling-on (in desperate need of toilet paper), embarrassment) last. It was the least I could do for the SA!</p>
<p>The left will have 12 months to whinge and see what they have left at the end. I have heard of some plans afoot. Should lead to some interesting meetings and protests. But I really don't give a shit anymore, not in Armidale anymore, have other things to occupy myself with.</p>
<p>I have to head back to UNE for a meeting in a week or so. Really not looking forward to it! So much bullshit - so little time! It looks like I will be returning to the hole every 2 or 3 weeks until the end of the year for meetings.

<p>That cop guy, Mick Keelty, is such a dumb idiot. He reckons that Australia is more of a terrorist target 'cause of the war with Iraq, 'cause this place called Spain got bombed, or something. But that's a total der-brain thing to say, 'cause there aren't even any terrorists in Australia. Anyone who paid attention during that Tampa thing would know that terrorists always try to get into Australia on illegal boats with boat people, so they can wait for years in detention and then on the off-chance that no one finds out that they're terrorists after looking into their background, there's a slim possibility they'll get into Australia on a TPV. Duh. That means all the terrorists are locked up safely in detention centres. He clearly didn't listen to a <em>thing</em> I said, or he'd know that <b>we</b> decide who comes in to this country and under what circumstances, and I certainly don't remember letting any terrorists in. Plus, even if they <em>did</em> get into Australia, how would they get past the fridge magnets? Huh? Yeah, Mick, you didn't think of <em>that</em>, did you? That's why <em>I</em> own this country, and he's just some police guy. What would cops know about security, anyway?</p>

<p>As usual, Mark Latham's been having a sook. He reckons we should pull all our Australian troops out of Iraq by December. What a spaz-wad. Our troops are over there to democracise Iraq, but they can't do that while there are still terrorists running around, and geeze is that place chockers with terrorists. As everyone knows, ""terrorist"" is just a fancy-schmancy way of saying ""Muslim"", and there's no way we'll have all the Muslims out of there by December. Especially seeing that every time they try to seek asylum in Australia, we have to send them back. Because <b>we</b> decide if stupid terrorist Muslims come into this country, and under what circumstances. And those circumstances are when hell freezes over.</p>

I think it's crap that just because Katie Holmes and James VD don't get along in real life that their charaters don't end up living hapily ever after.  I mean that's been the reason that people have been watching the show since season 1, to see how the two of them end up together.  Dickhead writers!!!</p>
<p>Oh and what was all the weird arse crap about <i>art-immitating-life-immitating-art-immitating-plot</i> in the last few episodes????!!!!!!  I mean really did Australian viewers get two seasons squished into one or something equally fucked up??!!  Fucking Hollywood writers!!!!!</p>
<p>Am off to fume elsewhere now because I'm sure that fucking UNE dial-up will fuck itself shortly.  Fucking metz!!!</p>"

There's a webpage <u>www.johnhoward.blogspot.com</u> It's very amusing and a piss-take of John Howard actually writing in a live journal. After the whole gay marriages thang this is what the PM had to say:
</p>
<p>
<b>Thursday, August 07, 2003</b></p>
<p>
Homosexuals are so bloody greedy. I mean, they already have a parade, and you'd think that'd be enough, but nooooo, now they want to get married too. They have some lame idea that marriage is about love or something. Idiots. Marriage is about sex. Sex that leads to babies. Babies that lead to Young Libs. Anyway, everyone knows that homosexuality is wrong and dumb and evil. 'Cause homosexual couples adopt kids or have IVF or whatever, and then wreck the kids' lives by raising them in families with same-sex parents. I reckon if a parade is good enough for the ANZACs, then it's good enough for homosexuals. Well, I guess the ANZACs got their own biscuit, too. But then, they were doing good stuff like fighting in a war and that, not threatening the survival of our species. Homosexuals are so gay.
</p>
<p>
I'm so sick of the ABC. They're so thick that they don't get that when we say ""media bias"", what we mean is ""media bias against us"". Dumb stupid idiots. I'm not sure what the letters ""ABC"" really stand for, but I reckon it must be ""Almost Bloody Communists"", 'cause the ABC are like, totally in love with the left. Once I said to Kerry O'Brien, ""If you love the left so much, why don't you marry the left?"" And he goes, ""Excuse me?"" And I'm like, ""Ooh, Kerry and the left, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g!"" And then he told me to get out of his front yard and to stop following him around. Another thing the ABC loves is foreign people. Apparently they even named a show about them called ""Foreign Correspondent"". Jeeze, why not just name the show ""We Love You, Foreigners. Please Come Over Here Illegally In Your Foreign Boats So You Can Take All the Jobs And Collect Welfare""?! And they even have foreigners on some of their programs. Like, there's an Aboriginal chick on Playschool. I dunno about anyone else, but I wouldn't want a foreigner singing ""Two Little Dickie Birds"" to my kids.
</p>
Minority groups suck.

So what if the PM has said that gays shouldn't be allowed to marry! It's the parties stance! Build your fucking bridge! You can't say you're shocked, I mean the Liberals and Nationals are very right-wing. And as one of their loyal voters it's no shock to me that they have come out and verbalised a party policy. <b>All you queerbies cannot be SO naive as to think that just because the equal age bill went through that all political parties are now going to bow and scrape for the queer vote!! Can you??!!</b> 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you all need to step back and remove the rainbow coloured glasses and see that no-one cares except you. The fact everyone hates a minority is because minorities believe that they need to be different and stand out. Maybe if you all just got off the soap-box for 5 minutes then you'd realise that if you act like a everyday person and didn't feel the need to grand-stand your gayness, then the gay rights movement wouldn't be <strong>SO</strong> offensive! 
</p>
<p>
As a lesbian I see nothing offensive about the comments in question. Yes perhaps I would like to get married someday, maybe not. But at this time the religious and political arguments put forward by The Honerable Mr Howard have my vote. And what is 10% of the vote going to matter to anyone, anyway?!
</p>
<p>
<H3>God save the Queen! </H3>

"event","<p>Almost the start of a new semester.  Must be time for some resolutions...  
<b>1)</b> I don't have time for immature fuckwits.  If you're being one I will have no problem with avoiding you.  This includes conversations such as <i>""I really like (blah) I'm going to chase them around and act like a complete fuck while I do it, because I know they're out of my league.  Then I'll whinge that I'm not good enough and how crap I am fishing for you to give me a compliment.""</i>  People should act their age and if you want to chase people younger than you who make your maturity drop like 50% then don't expect me to acknowledge your existance.
<b>2)</b> Spending more time doing things for an organisation that pays me would be beneficial.  Even though it shits me at times, the principles behind it are okay in my books.
<b>3)</b> Spending less time drinking and spending money on foolishness.  Then there can be moving money saved by the end of the year!  Whoot.  And don't bother asking where the moving is to... If I would like you to come and visit me I will tell you.  If I don't then, well you figure  it out.
<b>4)</b> People who know everything about everything shit me, always have.  The time has come to piss these annoying people off too!
<b>5)</b> For the most part my circle of friends needs an overhaul.  There are a notable few in the current circle that will be kept.  But the rest is dead wood.  <i>IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE PEOPLE!</i></p>
<p>I'm sure there was more that I wanted to write, but old-timers is a curse.</p>"

All in all my holiday is not much of a holiday after all.  I might be staying here for an extra week, then there can be holidays and relaxation.  <b><em>YAY!</b></em>  I'm sure there will be protests from a certain someone, but hey - I can't be arsed catching the bus from Brissy to get to the dale at 3am to then be at res school by 8:30am.

"event","im really tired of people who constantly need to justify themselves. I am tired of idiots that go to 82 and then fight whoever in the parking lot every week. Im tired of the guys that live on my street that hang out on my porch. If i dont say something to them when i walk in then they ask me whats wrong. Fuck you, If i dont want to say shit to you when i am coming home then take it and fuck off. I dont pay rent to have a fucking pest on my doorstep.
about idiots at 82, im not going to sit here and pretend like im the most mature person because i am not, i could have totally walked away and not been involved, but for some reason (denise,brian) i fel t compelled to. 
those people, however also need to fucking grow up, but there is really no hope for people whos main goal is to get as fucked up as possible every day. They are total garbage who will never amount to anything, and picturing them at forty, retired scenesters, strippers, ex drunks and junkies with kids makes me laugh and cry at the same time. Because lets face it, its cute now when you are young and have a tight ass, but it wont be so cute behaving the same way with gray hair and sagging skin.
but im happy that i know others, who also know the difference."

Recently my mom has been worrying to an excessive amount about me and my fixation on domination/submissiveness, and zombies and stuff like that. Stuff that im not even really emersed in. where the hell does she get these ideas? my drawings i think...
Shes fucking suffocating me at a point where i really just want to be alone with my thoughts...I have a lot to think about and resolve like school and work and my feelings and one regret that just sort of came up, and i was sure i didnt have any. but i do.

Im supposed to be studying for my final right now but, im not. I really need to do better. I need some kind of like...study 12 step program sponsor or something.
So anyways I am going to be home for the summer, taking classes at art center, and applying to art center. No tour. not warped tour anyway, but maybe some other tour at some point this year. As much as   I am hating studying right now, as much as I would like to quit school, to go frolic in Morocco or something, I do not want to wake up 30 or 40 years old and still working shitty retail/service industry jobs, in between cool projects and I reallly look forward to not having to look back."

So now I am sitting here....i am hungry. I am mad...and I see Guns and Roses and Metallica CDS here. What the fuck is that? Mom is listening to Metallica and Guns and Roses now apparently. 
She has presents for me but wont let me open them...Thats okay i guess...

Yesterday, Amanda went with me to the Yoga Expo and i bought a pilates ball, 5 Vegesoy candles, and a Brown Yoga mat bag. I think i might go gym shopping. I think once i get into this stuff and make a routine of it, then i will buy myself a jacket and yoga pants....all black.  ; ) If you want to call all of this yuppism, then fuck you, because you are basically saying that my reason for taking even the slightest interes in all of this, is not good enough for you. and who the fuck are you to make judgements like that? I am guessing you probably dont know the full reason either. 
Ive been sort of tired lately, but i think I am going to bust this unmotivated slump. I think i may take Karina up on that surfing trip one time. 
Last Thursday, I went to Dashboard Confessional....Kris is working at Vagrant now...him and Rob are so cute with their matching black army caps and similar beards... Twinism is cute. 
Last Tuesday, Sunday and Friday, I saw the Used, STUN and Yellowcard.  I got to meet Ben from Yellowcard, whos phone number was written on the wall of the girls bathroom in Huntridge along with Bert, and Derek from finches number....i think i know who wrote it...but everyone has a suspect in mind. 
I skipped out after the first three songs for the used and went to catch atmosphere. 
I am starting to feel the physical and mental benefits of being our of ""18+"""

So next day, I was sitting at home trying to complete my to do list, get everything set up for today, and i was sort of stressing out, but there is really never a point to stressing out about things that are somewhat within your control. Plus if shit will happen then shit will happen. Might as well use that energy for fun things. So i made this lasagna, but my oven wasnt working, so i went to dans house to use his. the filling was really yummy but the noodles were not so great. stephanie said she liked it....(YAY!) So then we went out for margaritas...and i ate this fajita...and had three margaritas...it was too much. So we went back to the crib, watched reno 911 and i immediately went into food coma. 
I think i want to cook for people EVERY DAY! it makes me so happy. 
Today we have the instore @ sunset, the show at the el rey, the show the next day @ the glass house. then in october the halloween show. I dont know what i want to be for halloween."

A few people said they liked it, (that made me so very happy)...then i went out...i didnt count on going to where i did go, but i kinda wanted to hang out with the people i was hanging out with a little bit more, instead of going to On the Rox and hanging out with myself in the corner. I would like to do more corner dwelling but im so tired. 
I didnt go out on sunday at all...well i went to anaheim for the drive thru tour, but...i was really distracted for some reason,  but i didnt go to 82. I dont know if i will be going for a little while. The last time I was there, some things that were said to me, and how ridiculously ridiculous I was being have made me evaluate why it is that i am even there. I feel like i should not be there at times and I think its wise to go along with these feelings."

Yesterday, we were on the beach. we fed a crab to a sea anenome. We didnt mean to. It was an accident. Seriously. I tried to pry it out with a blunt end of a pen but it was clear that the crab had a chance in hell of getting out. But my friends turned me on to this awesome taco place. I think I am going to take mom there when she comes to visit me. 

I don't like going to clubs so much anymore, I think. I think its slowly destroying my individual self. That sucks because I like my individual self. I don't wanna go to them anymore. I don't think I like most of the people involved, but at the same time I do like a lot of the people involved. At times I feel like sleeping is far more interesting. It isnt so much that I'm upset that there are assholes in the world, but I think i am more upset because I've been participating in something that I hate for 2 months.

I was in Las Vegas in a restroom, and I called phone numbers that were left on the wall...I was bored at an adema show, and today one of them called back."

I didn't know this area had ants....now i do. I feel somewhat guilty for killing the ant, because it was just trying to find food....but its better that one ant die and so that the swarm wouldnt come here and then i have to kill millions and milions of ants. Ants are like internet porn pop ups...you go on one site, and then here comes 50 million of them."

Today i think i am finally going to make lasagna. There are people in my life that insist I hang out with them every weekend, and i really dont fucking want to. One person in particular I'm thinking of.  For some reason i never considered this person among people I would actually like to hang out with, but they keep offering me things and making empty declarations about our ""friendship"". I think that these are my instincts and i should follow them and stay away. Someone once told me, ""Always look a gift horse in the mouth to see if they will bite your ass"". I dont understand why certain dudes cant grasp the idea that if i WANTED to hang out with them that I would reach out out to them and until then they need to get out of my face....Im a speed demon on the run (?).
I had a big old temper tantrum last night because I couldnt find my retainer, which happened to be snagged on to the outside of a bag that i had put away. It was like several hours long, this temper tantrum, and Im sure i made others miserable. But do i care? not....not exactly...not really. I mean i care in the grand scheme of things, but as of this moment i dont care about much.

"event","Everyone should read Bridges Over Madison County. I read the thing while me and my mom were driving to vegas one time. I guess that you know that a book is good when you go from being completely aroused to crying like a twelve year old. Also there is a little part about how Robert Kincaid, who is the photographer who goes to Madison County and ""puts it on""  Francesca, there is a part about how he is vegetarian.  Yeah, I was sold too.
I hung out with Stephanie yesterday. We went to the Grove with the intention of eating at P.F. Changs, but you know what? There is no P.F. Changs! Instead there is a Madame Wu's with the exact same menu as PF Chang's.  So we were pulling into the space in the Grove parking lot and this man decides to open the door right as we were pulling in. So i ask this moronic gentleman to shut his door, and his angry, Louis Vuitton bag weilding Significant other comes from the other side of the car and yells at us to wait and if we are in a hurry. Well, we clearly were, DURRHH...and you just dont  leave your fucking door open unless you are ready to get your ass out of the car. So then the guy comes to the back and you hear him say ""Just let me open the fucking trunk!!"" and she goes and pouts in the front seat of the car.  If i were her I would not waste time pouting. I would realize that I am an unpleasant and arrogant ball buster, and I would kiss his ass for being tolerant enough to date me.  I bet she thought he would run to her and apologize and realize what an asshole he is. Must be nice to think everything is going to get handed to you on a fucking silver platter. How horrible that she considers the fact that she has money enough. Like that is the only thing she needs to have going for her. What about being kind to people, what about being intelligent? What about being a good person? She had none of this. 

So we went and I had an avocado roll and wok fried eggplant and it was hella good.  Then I got a juice book to go with the Juicer mom bought me. Then we made juice. Almsot anything tossed in a juicer is good. 
So today I woke up, the cable got installed today, and I've been trying to complete everything on my to do list. Just trying to get things done and out of the way. I saw my ex-friend today. I am stoked that I dont speak to her anymore. I am stoked that I dont deal with someone that lives a complete fabrication, and I am 10 fold more stoked that I met some really decent people this summer."

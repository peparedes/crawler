"event","<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>this is really funny..i dont know where i got it from though...you fill out questions and it makes a live journal post for you...here's my update for the day..lol...oh god..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>Today was really fun. I got out of bed really late because my alarm clock has broken and I cannot afford a new one at the moment. I feel sad, because&nbsp;Kaylee and&nbsp;Erica are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night. I'm so angry.&nbsp;Ema is grounded. AGAIN! And I'm not allowed to see her. EVER. It's just NOT FAIR. I hate my mom and I wish she was dead. This wouldn't happen if I was allowed to live with dad. Last night I had to shave my entire body. Apparently, the lice that I caught from Kate's friend are really hard to get rid of. I look quite strange with no hair and eyebrows. I'd post pictures, but my webcam is broken.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>I want to tell the world that I love you all! You're all so special to me! I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted). Today, I got a new digital camera! Yes! But I don't know how to work it. Can you help me?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=2>I want to say thanks to the academy for giving me this award. I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, which makes me different enough to be interesting, but the same as all the other cool people with bipolar disorder. You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what your favourite sexual position is. That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this thought - sharing your life with strangers on the internet is the cheapest form of therapy available. Leave a comment and tell me I'm beautiful.</FONT></P>"

You're in charge for the week.  Try to keep the team reasonably under control, and make sure everyone gets a chance to play the better opponents from the other schools.  Yuki, especially.   

Seigaku and Fudoumine?  Feel free to torture their little lives out.  Yamabuki too.  

And if anyone asks, I came down with whooping cough.  Or any appropriate illness you may think of.

There's an interesting St. Rudolph regular I'd like you to play sometime.  His style of tennis makes an interesting contrast with yours.  His name's Terada Ayato and he seems eager to meet new players. 

I'll make sure you see him if we get practice games with St. Rudolph; otherwise, feel free to arrange a match by yourself.  


And thanks for the help.

I hate to admit it, but Yukimura-san and Sanada-san were damn <i>good</i> leaders.   And they had Yanagi-sempai to back up with data.  I don't know how strong Hyoutei is, or Fudoumine, or what's going on at Seigaku.  And even the lesser-known schools may be a problem; that Ayato from St. Rudolph was unexpected.

I have no idea what sort of competition we're going to face.  About the only thing we can do here is to build up a team so brilliant nothing and no one will be able to stand against it.  That, we can do.

On the bright side, Kenta is shaping up to be a rather good deputy, brother-complexes aside.

All right, 'fess up.  Which of you was it that decided it was good to set up practice matches with Fudoumine?  That was a great idea.  Who was it that decided I was looking to play Kamio Akira?  <i>That</i> was a completely misinformed and moronic idea.  You obviously don't have enough respect for my tennis.  

Seriously, he's nowhere near a challenge.  Fudoumine as a whole might be, though.  If we don't clean up our doubles act.

1) Winning.
2) Winning.
3) Tennis.
4) Tekken.
5) Buying sushi with Yagyuu-sempai's money.
6) Beating the hell out of <strike>Fudoumine</strike> anyone annoying whatsover.
7) <strike>Siccing Marui-sempai onto his brother.</strike>
8) Yakiniku, yakiniku.
9) Tennis players who don't suck.
10) Did I mention winning?

Tag to all the Rikkai regulars.  Consider it a team bonding exercise.

Practice today was - tolerable.  Kaede's serve is getting better.  Even if Kenta is obviously not taking my suggestions to heart.  

I wonder if I should remind him that I always have the option of going directly to Marui-sempai?

Of all the things I should be worrying about, the only thing that is coming to mind is: 'More the half the team are baseliners and what the hell are we going to do for doubles?' 

<strike>What would Yukimura-san do...</strike>.

Arrgh.  This is driving me nuts.  I think I'll go visit Tokyo today; won't have many chances before school starts again.

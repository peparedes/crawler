"event","Halloween should be fun.

I haven't slept at all, and my clothes are buried outside - all part of the costume, and I'm excited for this one.

I've been having a recurring dream lately (I think 3 times counts as recurring). 

I have a scythe for some reason and I am in a court house area. People with hand coughs are lead to me down a hall, and I can't remember how they look except for one man who has a top hat and a burnt face. Either way, the convicts (I assume) are lead to me in a giant steel chain that also handcuffs them. When they finally reach me I deliver a kind of death blow to the soft part in between their shoulder and neck. Nothing over the top or exciting happens, its kind of a quick in and out thing. One after another, like an assembly line. The people either die on the spot, or make a groan of pain and shuffle along to the back of the line. I can't remember what any of them look like (aside for that one), Just a large dark courtroom hallway with brown and tanned checkered floors. I also remember white Greek pillars as a design on the walls, the tops were heavily shadowed because the room was so dark. The man with the hat and the burnt face scowled at me when I saw him, but I remember it didn't bother me at all, whatsoever.

Its certainly a little weirder than my last recurring dream about the bassist of a Japanese punk band and a bunch of people I recognize in a supermarket."

"event","So I fell asleep after watching the Hamiltons last night, which had a pretty cool ending (although the movie wasn't amazing). It was followed by the best dream I've ever had.

It started with me driving a car with my friend Nelson Vidales in the passenger seat. I knew this was going to be awesome, because instead of being regular me I was some kind of conglomeration of Kurt Russel Awesomeness, So I looked like Snake Pliskin and I was driving the stuntcar From Death Proof (Grindhouse) with the skull on the back. 

I'm not sure why, but we slammed the car into the doorway of a building so the doorway would crumble and no one could escape as long it was there. Once doing that, Nelson and I got out of the car and I whipped out a chainsaw-sword and an over sized monkey wrench, and we began to kill everyone in the area. Nelson didn't do much, but there was so much blood everywhere, it was so insane. After everyone was dead, Nelson and I got back into the stunt car, and drove it into another buildings doorway, and killed everyone again. I can't remember how many times we did this, but there were so many. It was like Nelson would say, ""here!"" And I would drive the car into the doorway, then murder everyone. 

I remember being at this bar at one point, and they had very heavy wooden chairs. I grabbed a chair, spun full circle around and slammed it into this ladies MAC Book on the table. I remember watching the screen leave the base of it, and the keys flying in all directions in slow motion. Then I spun again, and railed her in the head with it, and Nelson motioned for me to go upstairs. 

I guess it got a little weird here (and a lot more like the Hamiltons). There was this girl from the Chicago POSSE, and she looked panicked, and she said, ""Don't kill me!"" I just began to choke her, and I could feel how hard I was squeezing her. She faked past out, and then I heard her cough, and began to strangle her even harder. She said, ""Please let me live"" and I told her something like, ""I can't its against the rules."" But she kept crying and I started to feel really bad. I let her go and she said, ""Please, I won't tell anyone."" I remember saying, ""This is completely against the rules!"" And then leaving. I went downstairs, and Nelson asked, ""Is she finished?"" I lied and said ""yes"", and we got in the car. 

I remember driving back I started to get worried she would alert authorities, and that I would have to ""move again"" (another movie thing). When I woke up in the morning, I laid around in bed just regretting not having finishing her off, she was the only survivor, and panicking that the police would be looking for us. 

As it slowly dawned to me that none of that happened, it kind of freaked me out how blood thirsty and real the dream felt. I remember like each person going down, and how nuts it was. It was all super vivid and slow motion... And why someone from POSSE? That was really weird.

I also realized that being Snake Pliskin was the coolest thing ever, and that Nelson makes a damn fine sidekick. 

Very bizarre. I gotta stop watching horror movies before falling asleep."

"event","Wow, I can't believe almost every stereotype of what could go wrong went down at the airport today.

Early in the morning I got a call and found out that our flight was canceled, and that Posse was trying to reschedule our flight with another airline as soon as possible. So after having a nice lunch with my brother and meeting up with Mohamed, I received a call at noon that told me the new flight would be at 2:30. I booked a cab for one thinking it was about a half an hour to drive there, and we should be alright to get on the plane.

So to start the series of Epic fails to follow, the cab came late. We left to get to the airport in the pouring rain (why the first plane was canceled in the first place) and ended up arriving at 2:00.

The line to check in was gigantic, and due the cancellation of our first flight, using the Kiosk became impossible. Realizing that making the flight with the length of the line was impossible, Mohamed and I did some poor attempt to cut in, which flopped. We got to the end of the line and called Posse, embarrassed with our news.

But wait! Our flight was delayed until 3:40! Awesome! Mohamed and I made our way through the line slowly, and I was randomly screened to get fully searched. It didn't matter thought, because just after 3 we had met up with our Posse and we're ready to get on the plane to Indiana.

The flight continued to get delayed, to 4, and then finally 4:20. They began to board quickly and Mohamed, Melody (who I kept calling Camille earlier in the day because I couldn't remember her name) sat back for a little as the line got smaller. We got on the line with our other posse members just ahead of us and prepared to board to the plane. We approached the door closer and closer with the line, and as we got to the front we found the door was closed. When I asked about the Indiana flight, they looked at me and simply said, ""It's gone"".

Now a few other people got completely screwed by this as well - how did they close the door on passengers who were waiting in line to get on the plane? There was no passenger call or row call (not that it should have mattered because we were on line!) and the plane took off leaving more than a few angry customers. We checked as a group to rebook our flight and they told us that the earliest we could get one was tomorrow morning at 8, meaning we would miss all of the schools morning and afternoon activities. I was fine with this, and thought I might be able to spend the rest of my birthday with Viki or something, being that her house is like 20 minutes away from Laguardia. My posse decided we should keep bitching however, and we managed to convince them to put us on the standby list for the 6:20 and 8:30 flights that night (which were completely booked). 

So around us there were people getting news that the earliest they could leave was 4 days to get to Virginia, and the entire airport was getting pissed (NEVER fly U.S Airways... ever). We made some smalltalk with other passenger's and Mohamed and I ended up laughing a lot while Melody (who was upset) started to feel better. The 6:20 flight was pushed back an hour, and we were ready to try our luck at standby as the plane began to board at about 7:30. We then found out that our friend Mohamed could not get on the plane from standby... why?

Because his name (First name Mohamed, last name Mohamed) was flagged, and he had to go get his name cleared. We decided to stick as a group, and missed the flight because of racist airport assholes. Almost an hour later, Mohamed was cleared, and managed to use that crap against them to get us confirmed spots on the flight at 8:30. We finally got on the tiny plane, and things went well. I went to star bucks after the flight and bought myself some cake, because you gotta have cake on your birthday. I mean, c'mon. 

We didn't eat, so after words we got some Taco bell. Now I'm in my host's room.

I felt almost disappointed when we got the flight in the end. I think I was secretly hoping the we could just take the morning flight, and I could leave the crummy airport and enjoy some of my birthday. I wasn't totally miserable or anything, and the happy birthday text messages from friends we're very nice... but the day would have certainly taken an awesome turn if I could have just spent the night with Viki and caught the morning flight. 

Haha, overall it certainly was an interesting Birthday. I did some Posse bonding with Mohamed and Melody, and I got to deposit my check in the morning. Awesome. I definitely won't forget this birthday, but I can't wait to get back and celebrate it with buddies and family."

"event","I have had a really incredible past couple of weeks. Bootcamp over the vacation was long, but every day was a lot of fun. In our group we did everything from dance workshops to trips to the museum, to meeting a very successful designer who worked on Marvel and DC comic characters... I met a whole lot of awesome people, and we all became friends quick... And we all ate an obsurd amount of Gray's Papaya.

So, it was thursday during the week off and my dad was going to New Jersey for an over night meeting. I thought because we all had to go to bootcamp in the morning, I would invite a bunch of those awesome people I met over to hang out and spend the night. I ended up getting 10 or so kids at my house, and it was plenty of fun talking and playing Guitar hero and such. As it got later, people called their parents to see if they could sleep over. It ended up being Stephen, Aaron, Jim, and the most shy reserved girl I have ever met, Sophia allowed to spend the night (she actually had no choice, living all the way in New Jersey). I felt so bad for her, it must have been super awkward... But it ended up being a lot of fun. We played Fatal Frame, told violent stories, and all got up for the Internship in the morning.

I also met a lot older proffesionals, who I emailed to see if there is anything they could show me. Already on tuesday I got an email back inviting me to a meeting at the Digital Art Network in NYU, where a group is joining together in order to recreate all the digital effects in a really old ""Star Treck"" episode. I asked if there was anything I could do to help, and they said, ""Sure!""

Wednesday I had an interview at ""Game Lab"", this really cool game developing organization right off of Canal street. They let the interns play test their productions, and even play mainstream video games (they have a huge collection) in down time. It seemed like a really interesting place, It would be wonderful to work there.

The flip side to all this is the small amount of time Ive been able to see my girlfriend and Jim, and Joe, and My other buddies. Its been weird having a full scheduale...

It will probobly start to cool down... So far, the Career Development Program has been one of the best experiences I have ever had."

I always get this amazing warm feeling when it rains. It starts at the back of my neck and travels through my entire body, giving me goosebumps where ever it goes. It clears my head so quickly of frusteration and worry, it just mellows me out. I think I'll go snuggle myself into a couch.
Omar was really nice today. He got me a copy of the Qur'an from his Masque, and then treated me to these amazing Arabic baked good with Pastachio filling. I'm trying to save one for Adam... But he's still not home. 

Shoshanas movie day was a lot of fun, those cookies were delicious.

Remember when it rained for like a week straight? I wish that would happen again."

I had quite an adventure sitting in the backseat of Steves car trying to lose this guy in a white cruiser. Zach Keen decided to flip him off, andHe was already pissed off because Steve decided to play the lane game. I geuss that set him overboard to the point of chasing a bunch of kids in an eclipse for like 10 minutes.

Zach Keen was so drunk on our return, he decided to get into Joe Maddens bed naked (along with Adam... Of course) and just lay there laughing until he woke up. He did, after Adam did ""The best part"", and just Gorilla slapped both of them until they ran out of the bed screaming like girls.

It was great to see Zach Keen again, it had been like 4 years. And I just saw BJ again too, who I hadn't seen in like... 6 years? Something nuts. Everything has been great except for this stupid dull head ache that won't go away (probobly from all the DS I have been playing).

Ah, I gotta go. It's pretty nutty here, I think Joe Madden may chainsaw another chair into peices so he can start another fire."

"event","My Contemporary World Issues class created a ""civil disobedience"" dubbed OPHAT (Which is Operation High school Awareness Tactics). We spent the last couple of weeks collecting about 500 party hats, and writing ""Confiscate this hat"" on it. Today the class got to school early, and distribute the hats to all the students to wear into the school. Like any hat, they were confiscated (although it was a slow process). The princibal would come into the class room, take off all the students hats, and then watch as all the students took another hat out of their backpack, and placed it on their heads.

We also numbered the hats. At the end of the day we had about 60 students lined up at the princibals office demanding to get the hat that was confiscated back. The hallway just turned into chaos as the kids demanded their exact number back.

The teacher tried to retaliate by making each of us write a short essay in order to get our hat back, so one person wrote an essay with a few blanks to fill in and just photo copied about 100 of them to pass out.

Then he tried to wait us out. He was there untill 6 o' clock, and just kept doing something else instead of giving back our hats. As soon as he left again (at around 4:30), we rushed in and grabbed all of them, and hid them in 204 upstairs so we can hand them out again tomorrow.

I suppose, even if it changes nothing like everyone says... It was a lot of fun."

"event","I havent really written in Live Journal in a while. This new, MY LJ thing is kind of nifty... Well whatever! I have lots to catch up on.

I found out something kind of crazy about 10 minutes ago, my brothers Ex-girlfriend Morgan died! Woah! That most certainly came from out of the blue. She OD on heroine, which is just terrible, and yet another solid reason of why I hate drugs. I was never too close with Morgan, but god damn it. 

For some lighter news!
Friday was a lot of fun. Mike and Melinda decided to have a romantic evening in the park... So we decided to follow them in black sweatshirts and a video camera. The dvd we were recording on ran out before Ivan, Dylan, Joe, Jim and I actually found them, but Jim remembered his regular camera. Jim stripped down to his boxers and ran out screaming to suprise them while i tried to take pictures as fast as I could. It was awesome. I had plenty of coughing fits thanks to that never ending bronchitus, and I can't believe Jim didn't get sick. It was pretty god damn cold out.

Halloween was also great. Melinda was Velma, I was Fred, Jim was Shaggy, Ephraim was rocky, Mojo was Scooby-doo, and Mike was Karl Marx. We got a solid load of candy, Tex-mex, and some nice pictures. Jim must have put on his shaggy voice 100000 times. Genius.

I have been playing ""Civilization 4"". Way cool. Everyone else has been playing ""Soul Caliber 3"", which while I can see why its so addicting, I havent been raping it like everyone else. It never ends... So much to collect. Aside from that there has been a little ""Stubbs the zombie"" and I put my reserve on the red ""DS"" that comes with ""Mario Kart.""   I sure wish everything in the world wasn't pushed back past Christmas, or it would be a pretty awesome time for video games.

I get the feeling all this drama is going to end soon. Not right away, but this stress is slowley disapearing, so I can go back to being my old self. I wish I knew where I was with Patricia though, right now things are very weird... If her parents didn't confiscate her cell phone and internet, I would just contact her and find out. Argh.

Pamela has been upset lately. I'm not sure at all what to do about it. I suppose, I will just keep trying to be her friend.

Starting to get chemistry finally. I'm going to bed."

Is anyone else Excited for Boondocks? The animation looks great. It airs the 6th on Adult swim, I geuss the comics were funny... I am excited to see what they do with the show.

So, the biblical storm is over (which just sucks). It was amazing to have that endless rain, and that gloomy sky. I got that warm feeling in my stomache that I was cozy everytime I stopped to look out a window, or just open the door and listen to it. I love the rain, it could have stayed like that forever.
I geuss its nice not to have wet socks... The rain was still better.

It didn't help others moods however. It was funny to watch everyone start to go nuts, and get all frusterated because there was no sunshine. My dad started to lose it after a bit, but that was much more of my fault for having so many people in the house. He's totally right, its not fair to come home to a room full of kids. This week I'll keep the house generally empty.

I had never been on the Statin Island ferry, and what an awesome experience it was. I stood outside as it howled with wind and I got pelted with raindrops, but watching the city go by and the water come at you was incredible. At one point the wind got so strong it pulled my bag full of cookies straight into the air and my glasses were pulled from my face. I may have had a split second choice on what to grab at... So the next day I went to the glasses store to get a new pair. The guy next to me laughed as my glasses got sucked off my face into the water, and I just laughed as well. (Pam made me the cookies... Which was very nice of her.)

A bunch of us were playing this game Farenheit on saturday. It was amazing. It's called Indigo Prophecy in America, Everyone aught to pick it up.

I have been doing mouse proofing with the Hoffmans, which has been a lot of fun/work. The house we are in now is gorgeous, and we are getting payed a pretty good ammount for it. I think it might just fund my Castlevania addiction. Nintendo will steal more of my cash for old friggan hardware, and I'm just a sucker for it.

Today at school I was feeling soo tired. I was feeling really down too, the same cycle of things running through my head. I don't think any of us are usually like this... But my goodness, recently things have been upside down.

After I had some time to calm down, Jim brought over his brand new video camera, which is sure to result in an endless ammount of stupidity. Oh man, even in the 2 hours we had there was so many videos that are just genius.

Then I went to the Whiteheads house for dinner because I knew it would be awkward for Adam to go alone. I had already ate, so I didn't take much, but everything seemed to be going alright. Jeffs Death aniversary is the 23rd of the month, so the friends and family of Jeff will be going to the park sunday and then back to the house for a small service. Seeing the family again was nice.. It wasn't awkward or anything like I was afraid of. I know come the 23rd again, its going get really sad.

I'm off to get some sleep tonight.
Hm... I wonder where my dad is.<br>

I am sick! I very much doubt I will be going to school tomorrow, because it feels like my nose has a heart beat.

I saw ""Corpse bride"" with a whole bunch of people, and it was amazing. There is a scene where he starts to play Piano - I was speechless. That art style is so gorgeous, they could have shown me any plot and I would have been in love with it.

Yesterday was pretty cool. I hung out with Maya and Jim, and while we were all talking, we all just passed out. It was a perfect example of how my house steals your soul - three people gone while in mid conversation. Later that day Jim and I slayed a spooky Skeleton with the help of a Paladin. WoW is much better than home work.

Despite for my head exploding with snot, I took a math test and I think I did decent. Chemistry could be going better, and there is an English test tomorrow, oh well. There is plenty of time to make it up later. Bleah. 
Speaking of math, I saw Pi. What an awesome, thought provoking movie. It inspired me to proove how Gatsby already had the American dream using algebra. I was math cursed. It was harder than I thought it would be.

I'm going to go pass out. Tomorrow Patricia is going to come over with chicken soup. Patricia is awesome.
 
Don't forget to thank Superman for saving Russia from Stalin.

Friday I had a whole bunch of people come over to watch Advent children, which was cool. A few of that bunch slept over, and Saturday we woke up and found this old tenis game I had for dreamcast. It was amazing! I had no idea I even had it. That was a nice suprise.

Sunday was San Genero day, so the Hoffmans and I arived there at about 7 to begin eating the stupid amount of food. Maya and her friend Emma even met us there, which was cool. Turns Out Brittany was there at the same time, but we didn't see her.
I ate:
1. Deep fried Oreos
2. Sausage Sandwich
3. Steak Sandwich
4. Eclair
5. Conoli
6. Funnel Cake

So good! It was all so good! I pigged out, and hopefully I can go back next weekend. The clown from ""drown the clown"" was halarious, and this guy from a dart game yelled at me, ""Hey Hairy, why don't you use some of that money you saved from haircuts and throw some god damn darts?"" We got home at like 11, and I went to bed.

This morning I woke up late because my 1st period teacher was absent... I took my time, and got out the door missing 1st completly, but meeting Patricia out side. It was a nice way to start the morning. Today was just fun, It wasn't awkward or anything. Everything seemed to work out, like when I forgot my gym Uniform, it turned out I had lab. I felt like I was back to myself today. After school I went with Patricia to see her house, and meet her cat ""butta'"". We hung out for a bit, and I went home when she had to go to work.

I got home, and check out my bros super duper computer... Oh man. It was crazy, besides for some driver problems and what not... It will work out. Adam left, and Maya and Jim came over, with an interesting idea.   It was time I shaved, so I got them to help me. It went great, thanks to them, and Maya took some before and after... And during pictures. It wen't a little bit like this:

After they had to leave, my dad did not get home untill 11 so I grabbed a delicious burger from across the street. Things have been just peachy.

"event","I woke up this morning and just felt miserable. I had the hardest time falling asleep. I passed out at 8 pm the night before, and woke up at 8:40 pm, then I laid around until 12, then fell asleep untill 1:30, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5 and then I couldn't fall back to sleep and had to get up at 7. 

I had this really weird  dream at some point in the night I had gone downstairs, but everything just kept spinning. It was like everything in my view was bobbing up and down and I couldn't see anything because it was to dark. I collapsed at the computer chair. I remember petting Mojo, or something, and then feeling like I was going to puke I was bobbing so much... It was a scary feeling. It was like I was poisoned, and I knew I was going to die.

I dragged myself out of bed, and I felt terrible. My throat was really bothering me. When I got out of the shower it cleared up a bit... But I felt really sad. I got completly dressed and headed for the door... And  then changed my mind. I took off my jacket and laid on the couch, and just thought about everything, and finally got some sleep.

I saw the Final Fantasy 7 movie: Advent children, which was graphicly the coolest thing ever made. Then I hung out with Jim and Maya for a bit. I got a lot of work done today, so I geuss it was good... I just needed some time to chill out, and let my mind wander in a quiet area - the comfort of my couch."

Everyone seems to be on a verge of tears as the school year began. It seems very tense, not just the people I usually see, but everyone. It's odd to be around, but there is no way I'm letting it get to me. Despite the drama and school work, I couldn't be happier. For one thing, it seemed so few of us were glad to see friends they hadn't seen all summer... I thought catching up was fun.

I have had an incredible month, A lot of interesting things happend. Thank goodness for numbered lists. 

1. I broke up with Pamela.
2. A whole lot happend between Patricia and I. 
3. I have been hanging out with Maya and Maddie, and some really great people they introduced me to. I spent some time meeting Bianca, Mike, Liana and Becky. We watched White noise at Biancas house, and Mayas mom cooked us a dinner party... Both days were awesome.
4. I went to Charlies party, and saw a bunch of people I hadn't seen in ages. Elias got pissed on. I felt bad for him. I don't see him or Charlie as often as I would like, not at all.
5. Lars Van Traers ""Riget"" (The Kingdom) is everything I hoped it would be. So is, ""How's your news?"", which is a video documentary about 5 retards traveling across America hosting a news show. Thanks Drunk Glenn.
6. I havent played WoW in like 7 days. School work.
7. Melinda rocks. Mango icecream.
8. Hanging out with Marc a lot, which has been nice. Hes been wanting to go to the gym to lose some weight, and all he can talk about is this girl he met in Germany, Jenny. His Europe tour with ""The Fiction "" sounds like one of the best times in his life.
9. I finally got to play through Rez, which was mind blowing.

More happend, but between falling asleep, leaving some things private, and just plain drawing blanks, this is pretty good. Some things have been awkward and depressing, but others have been some of the greatest parts of the year. I know I'm leaving a lot out... I sure hope it's just because I'm tired so I don't just forget it.

Today everyone hung out at my house to watch ""How's your news?"" We all (all of us being Patricia, Melinda, Mike, Jim, Jon and I) laughed at it and felt a little guilty, and Maya and her friend Gracie stopped by to say hello. Gracie had left before Maya came back, and we went out and got some food at the diner when Patricia and Melinda had to go. Mike bought me peppermint tea because my throat has been going allergy crazy, (I think... Season changing) it was very nice of him.

Bed! Sleepy"

Ah! I don't have much time, so quick recap after flipping through some totally pointless quizes.

I saw a Coheed and Cambria concert (who I seriously can't stand) Because all my friends in Florida were very excited about going. I heard that they were great live, and this show was being taped by MTV so it was bound to be amazing, and I thought that maybe after I saw them play on stage I would start to like them.

Hm.. Nope. I didn't think it was possible for a real person to sound so much like Alvin from ""Alvin and the chipmunks"" without Helium. The place was also jammed pack with some of the most bratty, winey kids I have ever met, where multiable people around me nearly got into fights because they are to stupid to understand that the place is filled (""stop pushing! wahhh!""). The floor space was so packed from the crowd I ended up dry humping sweaty dudes through 2 of the most annoying sets I have ever listened to in my life. The icing on the cake was at the end of the show the bass player decided to throw every peice of shit he could at the crowd (in hopes that emo girls would scream and try to catch them) One being his water bottle, which happend to bounce of my face and brake my glasses. Awesome.

Who even said they played an awesome show? The sound was way to low to even hear the songs past the screams from the fans. I admit it was cool when he began to play his guitar with his face, right before the band DIDN'T come back for an encore despite everyone in the place begging for one (well... Besides for me). Way to please your loving fans, the show time wasn't even filled yet. Fuck Coheed and Cambria forever.

It was great to see Steve, and I had a good time going out and playing the name game in a traffic jam, but I suppose Coheed and Cambria just isn't for me. 

My gross addiction lately has been a stupid amount of World of Warcraft. I have been playing it way, way to much.

Haha, does <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Swamp+Ninja"">this</a> make any sense at all?

Florida has been a lot of fun, I got to hang out with my mom for a bit and help around the house. I also found a book in the attic titled, ""Why Christians get sick.""

Ah! Dinner time. I will finish this later."

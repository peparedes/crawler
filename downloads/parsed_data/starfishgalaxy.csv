Alexis showing that he can do more pull-up's than I can. I'm drunk and I miss you, Alexis, and I hate 2009 and I miss you and your voice sounds like that Safeguard ad conscience telling me that I should be doing much better work than what I'm doing now, ugh..."

"event","It's so difficult to work when you know how many people have died because of Typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng.  Seriously.  I'm not saying that all the sad news is distracting, but it feels as if there's got to be some other way to go about this.  How can we recover as a country when as individuals, we're also struggling just to stay ""afloat""?  

October, you don't seem to be doing any better than September.  You know that, right?"

Please bring your fans, friends and family to join for a good cause. :)

Albeit on and off, I maximize when it's on.<br><br>Anyway, I heard of Moymoy Palaboy in August and didn't really have a chance to check them out.&nbsp; Their videos are the ultimate stress relievers by far! Miss the good ol' streethumor with a punch? Think Bulagaan '88! Simple, idiot prood and oh so hilarious.<br><br>I am one of the recent fans of the comic duo (specifically TONIGHT!) and if you haven't seen them, it's not too late. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/moymoypalaboy"">Check our their channel on www.youtube.com</a>. They can also be seen in the local comedy show <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bubble Gang</span>.&nbsp; Last night, a friend told me a story about celebrities such as Ogie Alcacid and Regine Velasquez having their photos taken with the duo and the guard asked them, ""Ano ba'ng banda n'yo?

"event","I'm reading a transcript right now and the interviews are ok. It's the way they're typed that worries me.&nbsp; Here are some examples:<br> <br> exceed = excide<br> three = tree<br> without = with out<br> leaving = living<br> aesthetics = esthetics<br> a lot = alot<br> minamaliit = minamaliet<br> seryoso = siryoso<br> <br> The first time I read such errors, I always think that they're just typos since transcribers are usually rushing.&nbsp; But sometimes they're consistent with their errors and that makes me wonder if that's really how they think the words are spelled. There's also the fact that they may not really be listening to what the people in the interview are really trying to say.<br> <br> This isn't the first time I've received a transcript which other people find funny. I think it's rather sad.&nbsp; Majority of the staff I've worked with in TV are very, very good, but a lot of them are not being properly trained, or are not being trained at all. For some people,&nbsp; they find errors funny. ""Ah, 'di marunong mag-English!"" But for me, I feel that the fact that they are poorly trained is a poor reflection on the company they work for. These people can be so much better when trained properly and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">passionatel</span>y.<br> <br> I also feel that people in the creative industry nowadays have such a hard time articulating their thoughts and feelings. They don't speak in full sentences or even when they don't need to speak in full sentences, they can't seem to connect the phrases that come out of their mouths.<br> <br> I'm not only speaking about how people speak in English. Even in Tagalog. I may not be that great in Tagalog, but I do know a lot of rules in constructing sentences in Tagalog and even the writers who are ""good"" in Tagalog don't necessarily follow them.<br> <br> What schools are teaching nowadays worries me a bit but what people are learning when they're already working is what worries me more.&nbsp; If you put an intelligent person in an environment where people don't speak well, that will kind of influence the person sometimes and instead of sticking to what he knows, he picks up on the errors and they become normal to him.&nbsp; My pet peeves in the media industry so far are the words ""footages"" and ""equipments"".&nbsp; They're like collective nouns, right? Like you don't say ""corned beefs"", right? And it's sad, right?&nbsp; I have nothing against the people who speak this way.&nbsp; I just find it sad.&nbsp; And I refuse to say such words just because everyone else talks that way.&nbsp; At the same time, I'd like to think that I've helped some people improve the way they speak, type and translate/transcribe certain things because it's important in communicating well with others and in communicating what is in the video and hopefully these lessons are passed on somehow. I don't want to just work with people because we are all paid to work together.&nbsp; We all need to learn from each other, and in my business, and in any relationship for that matter, communication is very important. <br> <br> I'm doing my darndest to teach my kids how to articulate themselves and communicate with people properly, in English and Tagalog, and I hope that when they start working, they keep learning and upgrading their brains, not downgrading into speaking the wrong way just because everyone in their workplace does. Ang chaka kasi minsan eh. :)<br>     <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

But as of Sunday, <a href=""http://www.odysseylive.net/miggy/blog/672/"">they're back on road to a rockin' reunion this Saturday</a>. Whoot, whoot!<br><br>Here's what odyssey blogged, information from Raymund Marasigan:<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">here's a text raims sent me earlier this evening:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>""dude, quote me on this:&nbsp; Philip Morris has pulled out of the show, but its pushing through with a different promoter.&nbsp; Aug 30.&nbsp; Tickets will be sold next week"".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Here's a message that Raims posted on yahoogroups:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;              <br><br>dear everybodyafter much ado. the eraserheads concert is most definitely pushingthrough. philip morris and its brands have pulled out from the concert. but another company is taking over the production. the turn over started yesterday and they have already started work on the site in the fort. so you can check.<br><br>there are good news and bad news. unfortunately its no longer free. all the long winded registration procedures in the red nation site is now void. <br><br>the good news is that the age limit is now 12 years old (for safety reasons) and tickets will be sold so you dont have to wait for confirmation and what not. the official announcement and ticketing details will come out in major newspapers and on the radio on tuesday.<br><br>these are the only details i know for now so no need to email me. imjust the drummer.btw. i just got home from the last rehearsal. the band is cooking. wewill see you all on the 30th.<br><br></span>I don't know if I'll make it this weekend but a lot of friends and I want to. So to everyone who's been fighting over this gig, rant all you want and get an outlet for your frustartions before the gig because I'm sure it's going to be a whole lot of fun! So let's just enjoy it. It'll be a good trip. :)<span style=""font-style: italic;""><br>  </span><!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

Because the DOH wouldn't give an event permit anyway. <br><br>Aside from <a href=""http://www.odysseylive.net/miggy/blog/669/"">a post on Odyseeylive.net</a>, I haven't seen anything on the news.&nbsp; Probably because it's a lazy Saturday afternoon, but everyone's talking about it and if it's true, then this is really, really sad news.&nbsp; I read that some fans actually flew home just to watch the show.&nbsp; There's an anonymous comment on Odysseylive that someone flew in from Italy! Ouch!<br><br>There's a lot of interesting talk about why this happened, who's to blame, how sad this is for Filipino music, but in the end, I think that there is A LOT TO LEARN from this.&nbsp; So let's not fight over this, let's learn from it...and pray that, if the cancellation is true, someone else has the balls to pull off the concert. <br><br>Any takers?<br><br>***<br>Meanwhile... look at this photo! It's the UP Ikot jeep!

"event","There's a discussion going on in a triathlon mailing list about having to pay extra at the toll gate if your car has bikes on a bike rack.&nbsp; Here is one story:<br><br>&lt;i&gt;             When i came home from the AAV Tri, I had my bike on the roof. As i exited into C5, the guy tells me i should pay P130, which is Class 2.  Just to shake him off, I said 'Eh kung ilipat ko sa loob ng kotse ngayon?'...he replied...'Sige sir, tapos P65 nalang'.<br> <br> Kinda dumb since I had already exited. Was he really gonna tag me as Class 2? or was he going to pocket the balance?&lt;/i&gt;<br><br>For a lot of bikers, this is all a bunch BS.&nbsp; It would've been an acceptable rule had it been enforced properly or if the guidelines were clear.&nbsp; Some bikers have even been warned because their racks are not registered with the LTO.&nbsp; So after all this hullabaloo, someone actually made calls to the Northern and Southern Expressway offices yesterday to get some answers.<br><br>&lt;i&gt;             Guys, I took the liberty of calling both NLEX and SLEX and here's the low down:<br> <br> SLEX:  <br> <br> I managed to speak to Alma Tuason, their Spokesperson about this (bossing...).  I have to say that she was VERY VERY cordial and really went out of her way to research this for us.<br> <br> She says that she has NO knowledge of such a rule - That vehicles with bikes on bike racks whose total height is more than 7'6"" should be billed as a Class 2.  As far as she's concerned, vehicles with bike racks on top are still Class 1.<br> <br> However, she added that there have been instances on the epass lane when the sensor picks up the height of both vehicle and bike and since the total height will exceed 7 ft, then it is billed as Class 2.  But if you will pass through a toll operator, then they should NOT bill you as<br> Class 2.<br> <br> NLEX;<br> <br> I spoke to their Traffic Control (a certain Bassy), and she said the same thing:  Vehicles with bikes on the roof should be charged as Class 1 toll only.  They measure the height of the vehicle and the bike is just considered an add-on to it.  So unless the bike you are carrying is<br> welded on your roof as an integral part of your car, then you should pay Class 1 only.  <br> <br> So kahit naka SUV kayo, basta yung yung height ng SUV is less than 7 feet, kahit na 5 feet yung seat post ng bike ninyo, ok lang yun.  Class 1 pa rin.<br> <br> In case you want to call SLEX, their number is 751-0372.<br> <br> In case you want to call NLEX, their number is 580-8900.<br> <br> The LTO has nothing to do with this rule.&lt;/i&gt;<br><br>I'd like to make calls myself but I have no time this week.&nbsp; So if you have any information on this ruling, please share your knowldege with us.&nbsp; Based on the information above, toll operators may just be pulling your leg by charging extra, so please be aware when you're taking your bike around.&nbsp; Check for signs about new rules.&nbsp; Or if they stop you for something, ask for a printed version of this rule, when was it passed, yada yada.<br>  <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span class=""insertedphoto""></span>So this is it. Project Hot Momma has officially begun (based on my bitching in <a href=""http://starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/journal/item/237"">my last post</a>).  First of all, my good friends in TV rewarded me with gift certificates for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Human</span> so I have new clothes. Yey!  Update #1 is about improving my looks/hygiene, but buying new clothes isn't my first task.  It's to stop biting my nails! This is where all my close friends and family say ""ows?!?!""<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;""><span class=""insertedphoto""></span>Anyone who has grown up with me and worked with me knows that I am a notorious nail biter.  I used to bite my nails a bit in grade school (which was gross because sometimes I'd still have chalk under my nails from gymnastics), but that all stopped when I got braces in high school. My braces were taken out right before I started college in Ateneo and I thought I had kicked the habit completely...until I shifted from Biology to Communication.  Yes, communication, in theory, is an easier course, but when Department Head Doreen Fernandez accepted me, it was under the condition that I raise my average from a 1.9 to a 3 and up.  Sh*t.<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;"">So I studied really hard, shelved my beloved science books and tried to keep abreast with what was hot in film, art, graphic design, advertising, it was a whole new ball game and I had to reboot my brain from thinking scientific to thinking creative.  By the end of the semester, I managed to get a 3.34.  A little depressing since getting in the Dean's list required a 3.35 (I missed by point zero f*ckin' one!!!), but at least I had settled into a new course with awesome friends and a loving department head who believed in me (bless your soul, Ma'am Doreen. :).<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;"">With all the stress of raising my grades, my nail biting was horrible. My mom was in shock. I tried everything to stop! I bought manicure that tasted like puke, I bought all these nail growth enhancers, and I even developed a love for colored manicure. I wouldn't bite because I wanted to keep the manicure pretty, but sometimes I'd be biting even when I didn't know it. It was like a disease!<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;"">I kept biting all the way until I started working for <a href=""http://www.probetv.com/probeproductions/gameplan.php""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">GamePlan</span></a>.  <a href=""http://karenborbon.multiply.com/"">Karen</a> remembers watching some footage wherein I was in the background looking at my nails, then I looked around to see if anyone was watching, and then bam!, I started chewing away.  It was hilarious.  Caught in the act...and I believe this footage is hidden somewhere in the Probe library.<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;"">I started freelancing and I kept on biting... until I met <a href=""http://sisguud.multiply.com/"">J</a>.  Aw. :p  He made it his mission to keep me from biting my nails, and true enough, I did.  We had a baby, we had great projects, yada yada yada, life was sweet.  And then we got this offer from <a href=""http://www.qtv.com.ph/"">QTV</a> last year to produce for a new lifestyle show called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Livin' It Up</span> and it was all downhill from there.  We were shooting the week we aired, I was editing so fast, my old boss <a href=""http://joyibaysoriano.multiply.com/"">Joy</a> would've found it unbelievable.  There wasn't even enough time to wait for a good interview transcript (which I am so OC about) for me to write a script.  I'd just write as I edited, which in my opinion is really, really bad practice in the broadcast industry.<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Three seasons later, J realized that I had no more nails.  As in my ring fingers were a disgrace.  They were only 1/4 an inch. Seriously sick, man! Don't even ask how much of my pinky nail was left!<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;"">This year has been much better, though.  I have once again taken a break from TV and I'm enjoying quality time with the kids and doing projects I like and I'm finally part of a corporation with amazing and talented partners.  But I was still biting.  And to make things worse, our son Tristan started biting as well!  ""I'm only biting my skin,"" he'd say, but I'd lecture him that ""that's the same excuse I give your father every time he catches me.""  And Layla would put her finger to her mouth, and I'd ask her, ""What are you doing?"" ""I'm being like you.""  Holy crap.<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;""><span class=""insertedphoto""><img border=""0"" src=""http://images.starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/SH1w2QoKCtUAAFfQRgA1/2115-1.jpg?et=JqxbFdXhdYt%2BWePxR%2BajBA&amp;nmid=0"" class=""aligncenter"" alt="""" /></span><br /><br />So now I'm back to purchasing nail growth products.  Had I known I'd be biting again, I would've kept all the stuff I bought before.  Now I'm using <a href=""http://www.sallyhansen.com/product.cfm?product=117"">Sally Hansen's Maximum Growth clear manicure</a>.  You put two coats on the first day and you keep adding 1 coat for the next five days.  You can also use this with Maximum Growth colored manicure, but these tiny bottles cost about 400 bucks a pop!  So I'm sticking to the clear one for now.<br /></div><br /><div style=""text-align: justify;"">This is Day 5 of the Maximum Growth's Daily Nail Growth Program, and I haven't bitten my nails.  Dang, it's like saying ""I've been sober for 5 days.""  But to actually have some nails that are long enough to open a beer can is considered an achievement in my book.<br /><br />PS. I would've started with kicking the cigarette habit, but that's too darn hard.  Nails na lang muna. :)<br />  </div>"

"event","I'm drunk right now and downing just one more Super Dry to get through all this.  A dear friend from college just passed away last Saturday and I just came from her wake.  I was happy to see old friends.  People say that the formation years begin in high school but it's in college when you begin to really own your identity and you prove it by doing well in your career afterwards.  You go for your dreams, earn money to buy things you've wanted for so long, and at the same time, you kind of lose touch with friends who were part of this whole identity formation process because you're so focused on reaching those dreams.

Ansky del Castillo was one of those friends who helped me own my identity.  All my friends in college, including high school friends whom I still keep in touch with the best way I can, are part of that whole growth process. But sometimes you're working so much, you kind of forego little get togethers becuase you have work or you're watching the baby or just don't have  enough time -- or as they nowadays, you just don't have enough freakin' gas! This week, however, I lost a friend and I can never see her again.

When I received the news of Ansky's passing last Sunday, I was actually on my way to a burial for a friend's sister.  I didn't know the sister well, although I felt the family's pain as I watch her siblings and her nieces and nephews cry over her loss.  But during the eulogy, I was also thinking of Ansky.  Every time a sibling cried or said something about their sister, I felt like they were talking about Ansky and it felt a little unfair that I was crying over someone else.

I attended Ansky's wake a few hours ago and prayed over her body. Some friends didn't want to see her lying in a coffin, but Leslie and I agreed that seeing her there in her pretty dress was the only to accept her death. We had to see her dead, a complete opposite from her live bubbly self in school and at parties.  I admit that I wasn't one of her closest friends, but many of us have had our moments with her and most of them were one-on-ones while drinking alcohol. Beer for me, Tanduay for her. That's how it was. 

I remember drinking with her in Helen's condo and although there were four of us there, Ansky and I had some long drunken conversation about kindness being a weakness. Ansky loved to speak her mind, even when she didn't make sense. But for some reason, it's when we thought she didn't make sense that she actually did.  As reserved as I was back in the old days, she wondered why I smoked and drank as much as I did.  I just said that it could be a repression thing that was only expressed or pacified by drinking and smoking.  She asked me, ""Kasi naman, bakit sobrang bait mo?"" I said, ""I guess that's just how am,"" for lack of a more creative answer. But she understood me, and at the same time, I understood her as well. Respeto lang ika niya. That's how she was. She always said what was on her mind, and I think that she (and Katz) taught me to speak my mind when it was necessary, which is probably one of the reasons why I'm doing well in my career and in motherhood.

This is probably why I'm only really reacting to her death now that I'm drunk.  Most of my moments with her were spent in alcoholic bliss, no holds barred, pure thought without really thinking of what we were saying. Quark and I were looking at her photos at the wake and I pointed at a photo of her with a funny face, ""Yan! That' s how I remember her!"" And Quark said, ""Oo, pero may ganon,"" gesturing that her hands would look like guns, fingers pointing at you with a matching ""Tsk!""

I miss her now. Crying to sleep didn't help, which is why I needed to write about her. It's funny how friends are reunited when someone passes away, but I remember what Fr. Ole said during his homily at the funeral of my friend's sister: When someone lives far away from you or you hadn't had the time to visit, dying isn't really different. Actually, it could be better because now the person is always with you in your heart, and that way, she lives forever.

Now I'm always going to look at the horizon differently, imagining Ansky standing in the view, smiling her funny smile with fingers pointing at me with her matching ""Tsk"". What a beautiful view. I love you, Ansky. Bottoms up!"

Our batch reunion last Saturday was a success with 85 batchmates in attendance, plus dates and one teacher, Mr. Floro Elloso, whom I tried to call Floro a few times but it just didn't feel right. Haha! <br><br>As a member of the organizing committee Studio Z, we are thankful about the turnout. I especially enjoyed the kuchai pie. That really made a difference in what started out to be one of the worst days of my life. I think God made my day extra horrible so that I'd find the reunion extra fun in comparison. It's a mystery. :)<br><br>Although I will admit that since I was part of the production, I was more concerned with things going right. The program started hellulate, but we had good bands (<a href=""http://thehaneps.multiply.com/"">The Haneps</a> and Streamline, thank you so much!) and a good crowd and my goodness, our P&amp;P hosts Pam and Paolo were amazing. I swear, some of us who are in media are actually thinking of hiring them for real events. I'm serious, guys! Wala nang hiyaan! <br><br>As it turned out, though, since we packed the place and the lights of the photo booth added heat to the bar (so sorry I didn't think of that, guys), a physical breakdown was in order. So right after the batch photo, my barkada helped me take all my ""production"" crap home and we capped off the night at Joey's new house.<br><br><a href=""http://starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/photos/hi-res/upload/SE1dDgoKCtUAACZwToY1""><span class=""insertedphoto""></span></a><a href=""http://starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/photos/hi-res/upload/SE1gNgoKCtUAAAtGRuQ1""><img class=""alignright"" src=""http://images.starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/SE1gNgoKCtUAAAtGRuQ1/_MG_9154.jpg?et=iTG36ygLVKLgESBGNvhUpg&amp;nmid=0"" border=""0""></a><span class=""insertedphoto"">I felt bad that I didn't get to chat with many friends during the party, but I'm glad that everyone had fun. That for me is enough satisfaction. It's what I live for really. :) And ending the reunion at 6 in the morning with my close friends in a beautiful new home was just perfect. I couldn't have asked for anything more. This barkada photo has new additions with wives and fiances, and we really missed the ones who didn't make it or live abroad. Wherever you MIA babes and studs are, we love you and miss you very much. Well, at least we added your photos in the slideshow. :p<br><br></span><a href=""http://starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/photos/hi-res/upload/SE1fawoKCtUAAHMd7Kk1""><img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://images.starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/SE1fawoKCtUAAHMd7Kk1/_MG_8761.jpg?et=3aK62kfDOCCO0AU7%2BNJNEQ&amp;nmid=0"" border=""0""></a><span class=""insertedphoto"">A lot of people don't really want to remember high school, but I'm glad that mine is so worth remembering and going back to. It pays to have a wonderful group of friends whom you know will love you no matter how many times you change and no matter where life has taken you. It's really important to have friends like that.<br><br></span><a href=""http://starfishgalaxy.multiply.com/photos/hi-res/upload/SE1dDgoKCtUAACZwToY1""><span class=""insertedphoto""></span></a>I also love the fact that no one expects much from me when it comes to my attire, which is why Carla's shirt (Carla, I borrowed this muna ha! :) was perfect for the occasion. I was, in fact, the only girl in the batch to challenge the boys in patintero in Grade 3, so this shirt lived up to my athlete/tomboy stereotype perfectly! Everyone loved it. It also says PATOTOT in back, which I was proud to be in my younger years. So cheers to the patintero gangs, saving patintero lines and lunch tables with colemans, and to Mr. Teo's kuchai pie!

Hmm?<br><br>(Student is silent)<br><br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, Young Fella. Is GOD Good?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Satan good?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does Satan come from?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From . . . GOD . . .<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this World?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evil is everywhere, isn't it? And GOD did make Everything. Correct?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So who created evil?<br><br>(Student does not answer )<br><br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there Sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness?<br>All these terrible things exist in the World, don't they?<br><br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br>Professor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, who Created them?<br><br>(Student has no answer)<br><br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science says you have 5 Senses you use to Identify and Observe the World around you.<br><br>Tell me, son . . . Have you ever Seen GOD?<br><br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell us if you have ever Heard your GOD?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever Felt your GOD, Tasted your GOD, Smelt your GOD?<br>Have you ever had any Sensory Perception of GOD for that matter?<br><br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet you still Believe in HIM?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Empirical, Testable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says your GOD doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?<br><br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing. I only have my Faith.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Faith. And that is the Problem Science has.<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor, is there such a thing as Heat?<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is there such a thing as Cold?<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sir. There isn't.<br><br>(The Lecture Theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events)<br><br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, you can have Lots of Heat, even More Heat, Superheat, Mega Heat, White Heat, a Little Heat or No Heat. But we don't have anything called Cold. We can hit 458 Degrees below Zero which is No Heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as Cold. Cold is only a Word we use to describe the Absence of Heat. We cannot Measure Cold.<br>Heat is Energy. Cold is Not the Opposite of Heat, sir.<br><br>Just the absence of it.<br><br>&nbsp;(There is Pin - Drop Silence in the Lecture Theatre)<br>&nbsp;Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about Darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as Darkness?<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. What is Night if there isn't Darkness?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're wrong again, sir.<br><br>Darkness is the Absence of Something. You can have Low Light, Normal Light, Bright Light, Flashing Light . . .. But if you have No Light Constantly, you have Nothing and it's called Darkness, isn't it? In reality, Darkness isn't.<br><br>If it is, were you would be able to make Darkness Darker, wouldn't you?<br><br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is the point you are making, Young Man?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my point is your Philosophical Premise is Flawed.<br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flawed? Can you explain how?<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, you are working on the Premise of Duality.<br><br>You argue there is Life and then there is Death, a Good GOD and a Bad GOD.<br><br>You are viewing the Concept of GOD as something finite, something we can measure.<br><br>Sir, Science can't even explain a Thought.<br><br>It uses Electricity and Magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one.<br>To view Death as the Opposite of Life is to be ignorant of the fact that<br>Death cannot exist as a Substantive Thing.<br>Death is Not the Opposite of Life: just the Absence of it.<br>Now tell me, Professor, do you teach your students that they have evolved from a Monkey?<br><br>Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are referring to the Natural Evolutionary Process, yes, of course, I do.<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever observed Evolution with your own eyes, sir?<br><br>(The Professor shakes his head with a Smile, beginning to realize where the Argument is going )<br><br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since no one has ever observed the Process of Evolution at work and cannot even prove that this Process<br> is an On-Going Endeavor, are you not Teaching your Opinion, sir?<br><br>Are you not a Scientist but a Preacher ?<br><br>(The Class is in Uproar)<br><br>&nbsp;Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyone in the Class who has ever Seen the Professor's Brain?<br><br>(The Class breaks out into Laughter)<br><br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyone here who has ever Heard the Professor's Brain, Felt it, Touched or Smelt it? . . .<br><br>No one appears to have done so.<br><br>So, according to the Established Rules of Empirical, Stable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says that you have No Brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then Trust your Lectures, sir?<br><br>&nbsp;(The Room is Silent. The Professor stares at the Student, his face unfathomable)<br><br>&nbsp;Professor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess you'll have to take them on Faith, son.<br>Student:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it sir . . .  <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

Maybe to pick up the kids lang and bring them here. Haha! But this place is gorgeous and it's filled with framed photos autographed by worldclass wakeboarders. It's wonderful but sad at the same time because at this point, the world knows about Camsur but the locals don't. Even Caramoan Island, which will soon be made famous by Survivor Caramoan (watch out for that!!!), has not been visited by most of the locals here. Hopefully Filipinios will smarten about travelling because it's great to travel around the world; but when you haven't seen the beauty the beauty of your homeland, then that's just sad. Filipino travellers should know their homeland first before they can say they've really travelled. At least that's my opinion. :)  <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","So I took the Isarog Bus Line last night from Cubao to Naga City for the Kaogma Festival this weekend and in all my years of going out of town for work, I've never been to a bus stopover that had a Mcdo. It's also probably because most of my bus trips were for adventure races and racers would get the cheapest bus ride possible, so medyo karinderia type rin minsan yung mga stopover with nice, warm lugaw and mami. Mmmm. But this bus had lazyboy seats, TVs (we watched ""Forbidden Kingdom"") and a banyo in it. Huwaw! And no, I didn't use it. Haha! Was a little afraid, too, since I'm also chlostrophobic.<br><br>Point of the story, I was so excited to see Mcdo when I got off the bus for my banyo break in Quezon. Some guy was trying to sell me some buko pie and I just said, ""Wow, may Mcdo pala dito?""

"event","Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this story will be a classic when Layla grows up! <br> <br> Again, the only way I can teach Layla tricks is as if I'm her varsity coach. Last year, Tristan was already teaching her how to do a forward roll on a mattress on the floor. She couldn't do it and I didn't want her to learn because she was also trying it on an actual bed and I was afraid she'd fall off at some point.<br> <br> So last week, the idea of the forward roll enters her head again for some reason and she started doing it on our bed. It's a queen size bed and any bed is potentially dangerous for these tots. Then again, I was so annoyed that she kept doing it the wrong way!&nbsp; So I decided to teach her and give her some ground rules on doing a forward roll on a bed.<br> <br> Mommy: Ok, Layla. Like this. I'm allowing you to do the forward roll...can you say that? Forward roll?<br> Layla: Forward roll.<br> Mommy: Yes, good. I'm allowing you to do the forward roll on the bed only if you stand here in the middle and do it towards the pillows. Yes?<br> Layla: Yes, Mommy.<br> Mommy: Ok, now I will teach you how to do a forward roll. First, you stand up straight, feet shoulder width apart. Ok?&nbsp; Then you bend your knees, put your hands down beside your feet...keep them there ha. Put your head in between your legs, butt up, head in...and go!<br> <br> Applause, applause! She couldn't do it without me giving her butt a push, but she got the idea and that was a fun night of rolling.<br> <br> A week later, Jay and I were watching cartoons and all of a sudden, she stands up in between us and says, ""Look, Poppy! You stand up, put your hands down, put your head in and wheeeee!!!"" Hahaha! And she's been doing this pala for days now in Mom's room!<br> <br> So there, it is a joy to see that my daughter actually follows me and remembers all the little steps in the little things she learns from me. :)<br>    <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","This was originally posted by the super talented <a href=""http://kamelle.multiply.com"">Camille</a> and I hope she doesn't mind that I post it also because it's just so, so beautiful.&nbsp; I am so moved right now.<br><br>***<br>October 20. 1966<br><br>Dear Aunt Fannie,<br>&nbsp; This morning, my platoon and I were finishing a three-day patrol. Struggling over steep hills covered with hedgegrows, trees and generally impenetrable jungle, one of my men turned to me and pointed a hand, filled with cuts and scratches, at a rather distinguished-looking plant with soft red flowers waving gaily in the downpour (which had been going on ever since the patrol began) and said, ""That is the first plant I have seen today that doesn't have thorns on it."" I immediately thought of you.<br>&nbsp; The plant, and the hill upon which it grew, was also representative of Vietnam. It is a country of thorns and cuts, of guns and marauding, of little hope and of great failure. Yet in the midst of it all, a beautiful thought, gesture and even person can arise among it waving bravely at the death that pours upon it. Some day this hill will be burned by napalm, and the red flowers will crackle up and die among the thorns. <br>&nbsp; So what was the use of it living and being a beauty among the beasts, if it must, in the end, die because of them, and with them? This is a question which is answered by Gertrude Stein's ""A rose is a rose is a rose."" You are what you are what you are. Whether you believe in God, fate, or the crumbling cookie, elements are so mixed in a being that make him what he is; his salvation from the thorns lies in the fact that he existed at all, in his very own personality. There once was a time when the Jewish idea of heaven and hell was the thoughts and opinions people had of you after you died. <br>&nbsp; But what if the plant was on an isolated hill and was never seen by anyone? That is like the question of whether the falling tree makes a sound in the forest primeval when no one is there to hear it. It makes a sound, and the plant was beautiful and the thought was kind, and the person was humane, and distinguished and brave, not merely because other people recognized it as such, but because it is, and it is, and it is.<br>&nbsp; The flower will always live in the memory of a tired, wet Marine, and has thus achieved a sort of immortality. But even if we had never gone on that hill, it would still be a distinguished, soft, red thornless flower growing among the cutting, scratching plants, and that in itself is its own reward.<br><br>Love,<br>Sandy<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">On 11 November 1966, less than three weeks after he wrote this letter to his great-aunt Mrs. Louis Adoue, Marine 2Lt. Marion Lee Kempner, from Galveston, Texas, was killed by a mine explosion near Tien Phu. After he disarmed one mine, another was tripped by one of his men. Although wounded by shrapnel, Lt. Kempner ordered the corpsman to take care of the other wounded man first. He died aboard a medevac en route to the hospital. He was 24 years old.<br><br><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 102);""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">For the red thornless flowers I have seen and heard and felt, both strangers and friends alike; past and present, in passing and in the trenches.</span></span></span></span>  <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","Ever since I was young, I've been very conscious about how much things cost. It all started when I was 6. I had seen how records would play on a turntable, so I opened my Papa's turntable, put the needle on the ""carpet"" that covered the turntable, and started spinning. Spin, spin, spin, spin. Papa started screaming as he saw the needle rubbing on that ""carpet"" over and over again. So I busted a P3,000 needle...and didn't get those jack stones Papa promised to buy for me.<br /><br />The second time I learned about the value of money was in a country club when I thought we could just sign for stuff all the time! Mommy and I passed by the candy store one day where I spotted some Fruit Stripes gum and I asked my mom to get me some. She said, ""Sorry, I don't have any money,"" and I was like ""[Duh,] you just sign for it!"" She laughed and explained that she paid for everything we bought at the end of the month and my jaw just dropped. Since then, I became an incredibly picky shopper. The worst part was when I was already reading <a href=""http://www.archiecomics.com/"">Archie comics</a> and, the whole dilemma between buying a Jughead, Archie or Betty and Veronica digest was a killer.<br /><br />I also remember wanting to buy my first album with my own savings. I was in the Alabang Commercial Center in the old department store there and I saw the first <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer"">MC Hammer</a> album on cassette tape. It was only 90 bucks and in today's standards, that's dirt cheap. But with only P50 a day for baon, I had a lot to think about. I held that tape for the longest time and I thought, ""Do I really want the first album I buy with my own money to be MC Hammer?"" I put the tape back and bought <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2BC_Music_Factory"">C+C Music Factory</a> instead. Haha! Labo ba? Basta point of the story is that I thought long and hard about what to spend my ""hard earned savings"" on. :)<br /><br />There was one garage sale when I sold practically everything I had just so we could have more space at home and I could have more money to get by. Now that I'm older, I have absolutely no collection to show my children. And sometimes I sound like a poser because I tell them about good books to read, cool films to see and cool music to listen to, but I've never actually heard, seen or read any of them. I just know from friends and from the articles I've read. I'm glad they understand the value of money, but I'm also trying to show them the value of collectibles and things that you hold dear, thing that you're passionate about. So as much as possible, <a href=""http://www.sisguud.multiply.com"">Jay</a> and I buy the best albums and films when we can afford them, we get the kids really good books (especially the graphic novels) and we take the kids to experience cool things when we can, like when we took Tristan to see <a href=""http://hoops.blink.ph/2007/08/28/kobe-bryant-supernatural-tour-hits-manila/"">Kobe Bryant</a>, and when they attended the <a href=""http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2007/11/gallivants-travels.html"">Neil Gaiman</a> press con in <a href=""http://www.fullybookedonline.com/event_details.asp?eventid=2"">Fully Booked</a>...we seriously pull a lot of strings if we have to, too. :)<br /><br />I'm watching <a href=""http://www.deathcabforcutie.com"">Death Cab for Cutie</a> right now on <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/"">Letterman </a>and as much as I love the band, I don't own any album, I don't know the titles of their songs, and wow, this is the first time I've ever seen them. Kind of makes me sad that compared to most of my contemporaries, I'm so behind in the scene and in life, but at least I can take pride in the fact that I work very, very hard so that my kids won't be. :)"

"event","It's been a loooong time since I blogged about little happy things and I think I need to write again to help me cope with adulthood :)

So let's get on with it! Layla is now 2 years and 6 months old and is quite a talker.  We have actual conversations and she already makes me loko, as in, ""I'm just kidding, Mommy."" Both annoying and endearing really. 

Now that she's a toddler, the tricky part is teaching her things but at the same time letting her learn skills on her own. Take the slide for example. When kids are small--and not to mention LIGHTWEIGHT--you just hold the baby while they slide, wheeee! But as she got bigger, I had to bring a yaya to the doctor's clinic where the little slides were so that yaya would carry her instead.  But now she's really heavy and I thought it was high time she knew how to slide by herself.

Last month, we went to the doctor's clinic again just to buy some meds. There was a bigger girl playing on the bigger slide, around 4 feet high.  For a two-year old, that's pretty high. But she went for it anyway, so I guided her the best way I could...like a varsity coach.

Layla: Mommy, watch me! I'm going to slide by mineself.
Mommy: Ok! Remember what I taught you! Ehem. Now sit down properly, feet in front. That's it.
Layla: I go!
Mommy: Wait, wait, wait! Remember! Hands on the side. Chest out. Head up. Ready?
Layla: Go?
Mommy: Go! Head up, head up, keepyour back straight...
Layla: I did it!

Yup! She did it alright! First time to slide by herself! She deserved a medal, so I gave her a tootsie roll. Pfft, so easy to please. :)"

Finally! After 2 years!

Please visit the gigs to get a copy. Check out the website fo the gig sked. You also have to see them live because they're awesome. Not one of those better-when-recorded bands. Hehe. 

And if you love driving, the album is excellent driving music. The song ""Control"" on C5 always makes my day.

The music video of ""Impyerno"" is also on MTV right now, so I hope you enjoy that.

Sigh. I'd like to say that it's time to take a break, but after the launch, work just seems to be pouring in! It's insane! Gigs galore, projects, rackets, the need to exercise! Haha! Astig. :)"

"event","so i'm officially a working mom, leaving Layla at my mother's in the morning and running errands all day long. but i did enjoy editing one avp because i edited it in my mom's house, so i was still close to Layla and nursing her when she was hungry.

i'm so attached to her, it's insane. and it's so hard to leave her with a yaya because i get so jealous! i've been jealous before, but this is crazy. one yaya that we were trying for 2 weeks was kissing Layla's feet and i started burning inside, grrr, she's kissing my baby's footsies!!!

plus i'm working like crazy! i can't wait for summer. beach...bora! woohoo! it's that time of the year!"

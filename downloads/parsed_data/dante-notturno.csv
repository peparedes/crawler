"event","<p>I saw Transformers last weekend. They&nbsp;definitely made a good movie, even though they did reinvent quite a bit. With ever changing technology, it's understandable why they would, and I don't think it takes too much from the movie. I guess it's part of the nostalgic 80s child who wishes they could have left some things alone. Prime is the wrong kind of semi, and his paint job is a little over the top; he looks like something you'd see as a carnival. He&nbsp;is voiced by&nbsp;Peter Cullen, the original voice actor, so I give that a major plus.&nbsp;<br />I don't mind Bumblebee being a Camero so much, especially since they did reference his old form (he's parked next to an old Volkswagen Beetle at the beginning) and they made it quite clear that he can update his form when he chooses.&nbsp; My main objection was that Devastator was a tank, instead of being the giant robot formed by all the Constructicons. What gives..? If they're gonna get lazy with certain characters,&nbsp;they might as well replace him with a smaller, easier&nbsp;character to deal with<br />There were a few cheesy parts as well, like when the robots are waiting outside the boy's house. I can definitely&nbsp;see the need&nbsp;for humor,&nbsp;but I think some of the cheesiness could have been omitted, or toned down. &nbsp;It would leave time&nbsp;for more important things, and reduce&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;groans from the audience.&nbsp;<br />The CG effects were just amazing, even if the characters weren't all true to original form.&nbsp; I expect they'll be even more impressive in the sequel.&nbsp; <br />Overall, I think the movie succeeded, and I'm sure the sequel will be even better. I hope they'll decide to go back and use some more elements from Generation One, and not reinvent too much more...</p>"

It's time to break out the winter clothes."

"event","Another job interview that didn't turn out as good as I hoped. At least this time they were straight-forward about telling me that I didn't get the job, and why. I had a string of 'bad signs' all day leading up to it. First, getting lost on the way, stuck in traffic on the freeway. Plus, I forgot to bring an extra copy of my resume, and my portfolio. (smooth move) 
I tried calling a friend in the area, to maybe meet up, but both times I called I was cut off. I wonder what's up. I hope I haven't offended, or freaked her in any way. There are things I probably should have done differently when I had the chance. Well, I hope things can be resolved, if need be. 
In the meantime, I'm trying to keep a positive outlook."

I don't know if we're actually relationship material, or if we'll end up being really good friends, but it's good to meet someone. I need to get out and do that more often."

"event","I'm up early for once. If I can keep myself awake all day, I may sleep well for one night. It'd be nice if I could find a job today. I'd really sleep well then. Guess I'll have to get out today, and get some leads. If it weren't for my discomfort in social situations, I'd go out and pound the pavement the old fashioned way. Sitting around surfing the net is convenient, but it isn't a very stimulating activity; not to mention the many distractions the Intenet has to offer. Either way, I seriously need to get going with this job search."

"event","Man, the trouble I go through just to sign in. I forgot my password, again, so I had to reset it, again. I need to make a habit of posting here more often, so that I can remember my password, or take the time to change it to one I'll remember. 
Hung out with Ashley tonight (she is mad cool). I am currently feeling pretty decent right now, which is rare for me these days. I woke up at 11 this (it would technically be yesterday) morning, but went back to sleep, and didn't get up til 2. I just couldn't stand to face the world. What, being unemployed and single. Not the healthiest choice of living, especially in this day in age. Not that it's a choice. I just have to hang in there until I can better my situation. Am currently debating how to deal with a past employer who might have a negative impact on my future employment prospects. I wish I had some legal advice, because I'm unsure of the best way to deal with this (bullshit) situation, and don't want to fuck myself into an even tighter corner. I guess I'll just have to see what happens..."

"event","I've been spending the past months searching for jobs, and it's getting desperate, or at least it feels that way. I just handed in the aps for part time/seasonal work. I'm not sure what my next move should be; call back some places, or send out more resumes. I'll assume the answer is 'all of the above', and act on that."

"event","Two hits were all I needed, even more than I needed, actually, to feel it. I considered not doing it at all, but my friends had it, and I figured, I do it so infrequently anyway, so what the hell. Honestly, I think marajuana is so overrated; it's no worse than having a few drinks here and there. As with drinking, you've just got to be careful what you do afterwards. 
I've been so busy with school that I've come close to forgetting certain assignments. I'm lucky I only have two classes this quarter. If I'd had to have 3, I don't know if I'd make it. I'd find a way, I'm sure, but my sanity might not have survived. I have such high expectations for my final animation project. I haven't been happy with too many of my past ones, so I plan to put some extra effort into this one."

"event","I can't believe we're already a quarter of the way through school. Eeep. This year is going ungodly fast. Took mi espanol examen hoy. Creo que saco buena nota. I hope so, anyway. She only gave us an hour to take the test, so there were only, like, ten people that finished when the bell rang. I was done first. Hope I didn't go too fast. Oh well. The worst thing ever that could happen would be that I fail Spanish Two and have her again next year. If that was the case, I would indeed kill myself. Or perhaps slaughter a younger sibling. As long as the sacrifice is made.

Oh! Happiness! I had piano yesterday. I pretty much just strutted my stuff while my teacher told me how amazing I was. Teehee. It was a good time. I might be doing a duet with Scott Duffy. That would kinda just make my day. Scott's super rad. Hooray.

There's a dance tomorrow night. I don't know if I'm gonna go yet. Leah said she was gonna go to a volleyball game and was gonna ask if I could come, but apparently, now she and Alex are doing something? That's just what I heard from someone, I don't really know. But Alex asked me to babysit, I think so she could do something else. Roar. It's not supposed to work like that. 

I was called an Oompa-Loompa today. Secretly, I took it as a compliment. I heart Oompa-Loompas.

Meh. I suppose it's time for me to get back to working on my Halloween story for Creative Writing. I am well aware that it's past Halloween, but I won't be finishing this for quite some time. 

I hope Troy remembers my birthday. Even if he just took the time to call. I mean really, after everything I did for his birthday, the least he could do would be to call me and say happy birthday. It's really not that hard. I realize he's not doing so hot right now and I realize he's busy, but for crying out loud, I'm his girlfriend. I talked to him last night, but only for a few minutes. I know I probably should bitch him out and explain to him that if we're gonna make this work, some stuff is gonna have to happen, but I didn't have enough time. And honestly, I don't want to. I feel like I need to but it's not like it would make me feel any better. It would just make me feel guilty 'cause I have a guilty conscience like that. I hate being mean. Bah. 

I want a salad for lunch.

"event","I'm so tired of everyone at school. They're so fucking closed minded. Everyone's so afraid to have an opinion because they're terrified of what someone else might think. Nothing's cool unless half the school already has it and you're completely confident you won't be made fun of. 
It's pathetic.
It used to be that if you wore black t-shirts with band names on them, you were considered goth. Ever since Green Day showed up in Madison last year, those ""totally punk"" bands like Green Day and MCR are cool. But if it's any kind of band that's not on Z104 or MTV, it's crazy. You're crazy. You're just not cool.
It sometimes amazes me just how pathetic people are. How absolutely, fucking pathetic people can be. They're all a bunch of homophobes. If something goes wrong, it's gay. That truly pisses me off. I wore a rainbow headband to school yesterday. It looked adorable. Yet even though it looked great, I got a bunch of shit for wearing it. Because everyone in school is fucking homophobic. People came up to me and asked me where the Gay Pride parade was. It makes me sick. It makes me fucking sick. Why are people so intolerant? Love is love. When will people understand that? I can not, for the life of me, put into reason why it's not socially, politically, or religiously acceptable for two men or two women to be in love. In the Catholic faith, being gay is not acceptable. I don't understand it. We're supposed to love everyone, but if you're gay, you're not welcome. How does that work? What is really so wrong with gay people? I'll never understand. If love means truly caring about someone, how can anyone think they have the authority to ban that God-given right simply because you care that much about someone of the same sex? I guess I'll never get it.
I am just so tired of people being completely unwilling to accept something just because it's different. The other day, I was told I dressed like a ""music weirdo"" because I wasn't wearing a baby tee and Abercrombie jeans. There are so many people that are actually afraid to wear something because they don't know what their friends will think of it. It makes me mad. 
What ever happened to individuality?
Is our entire society going to turn into a bunch of picture perfect Barbies?
Will people ever learn that different is not bad?"

Nothing's really fun anymore. Everything's just been a blur. Home, school, home, bed, do it all again the next day. I have nothing to be excited about. My birthday's in three weeks. But I'm not excited. I'm not getting my license. I'm not having a party. There won't be any presents (I know, I sound like a little kid). But it'll be us and the grandparents, going out to eat, and having cake from a box. There wont be any big surprises. I'm not gonna feel any older or cooler or more special. Just another year that's gone by. Another year that I haven't accomplished nearly as much as I probably should have. I really have nothing to look forward to. 
I work Saturday. I'm absolutely dreading it. Literally. I hate that job so much. Those kids drive me insane. I can't control them anymore. Annie does not listen to anything I tell her. The boys follow everything Annie does. Ethan's the only sane one and that's because he can't talk yet. But even the last time I was there, Annie managed to rope him into her little Rebel Against Kati game. It fucking sucks. My Saturday is ruined after that. I hate it so much but I'm too afraid to quit because I need the money so bad. What I really need to do is start being a little bit responsible and finding myself a new fucking job. Who cares if it isn't bussing tables? I need the money. For crying out loud, I was a nanny. McDonalds has got to be heaven compared to the hell I'm currently working in. I'm kinda stuck here. I don't want to quit because I need the money and I'm afraid of a bad rep in the working world, seeing as she does own a restaurant. But I can't stand it. I hate that job. I hate it so much. And one of these times, one of the kids is gonna get hurt. I'm just waiting for it. They go off and ignore me and play one of their little games and someone's gonna end up in the hospital. And naturally, since I am the babysitter, it will be my fault. Oooh that is gonna fucking piss me off. 
Well, enough complaining. Chem is almost over and I need some lunch. Bah. I need something to  be excited for."

"event","Falling out of love. It's a crazy thing. I used to believe it wasn't true. That you couldn't do it. You fell in love nd that was the end. You and the guy of your dreams lived happily ever after and nothing changed. But I've figured out a lot of things lately. Perfect isn't real. Love is not what you think it is. There's only so much you can do for a person before you accept the fact that you're done. There's nothing else for you to do. After all the effort you put into it, you learn that you're useless and you can't do anyhting anymore. It's a lost cause. He's my lost cause.
I never thought it'd come to this. I was so sure I could help him. I was depressed and I got better, so why couldn't he? I thought maybe, just maybe, if I showed him how much I really did care and I put everything out on the line for him, that he'd be alright. But it's useless. There's just no point anymore. He told me he cut. I kept calm and thought since he told me, he stopped. Turns out, he just did it more. And when he wasn't able to anymore, he told me. And I freaked out.  I cried myself to sleep that night. This entire world is fucked up. I wish things worked like they're supposed to. I wish books and movies weren't so misleading. Everything makes you think if you wait long enough, you'll get exactly what you want and everything will end up perfect. Fuck perfect. Perfect doesn't last. Perfect is what makes you think you've got everything you've ever wanted, while in reality, the world is just waiting to watch you fall. I fell. I'll admit it. I was so sure what me and Troy had was perfect. I really thought this was everything I'd ever wanted and that for once in my life I could actually be happy. But then Carolyn happened. After that night, everything was a downward spiral to hell. I was so sure it had to stop somewhere, but it hasn't. I've waited for seven months. Every wish I've made since that night has been for Troy. Everything I've asked for has been for him. I got a job so I could have money to get a car. I got my temps at 7:00 in the morning to get my license as soon as I possibly could. I worked hellishly long hours at a job I hated with more passion than you could imagine, and put nearly all of it in the bank. So I could get a car. So I could see Troy. So I could be with him and let him know how much I love him and how much I care. But it's all backfiring my face. I give up my two days off school for the whole year, cancel any plans I might have, to be able to see him, and he still doesn't know if we can hang out. I know the answer. I know what it'll be. He's gonna say no. I still can't  figure out why. According to Peggy, his parents plan stuff weeks in advance. So he'd know if he had to do something. A five second ""Mom, what are we doing the 27th"" would find out exactly what he's doing and find out if we can hang out together or not. But he either doesn't ask till the last minute, when it's too late to do anything, or he knows but doesn't tell me until a week before. It drives me crazy. Because every day that goes by is another day I do nothing but think about him. And for once, it gives me something to look forward to. Something to be excited for. Something to make my life a little more bearable. So I get all pumped up until five days before we're supposed to get together, and he tells me no. And I end up crying. I hate it. I learned after a few times of freaking out on him that as long as I don't have my webcam on, I can pretend it doesn't affect me. But it does. I feel like he doesn't care. Like he can't even make the effort to see his girlfriend after three months. I know it's probably not his fault. And I'm sure the last thing he needs is a clingy, nagging girlfriend whining that she can't see him, even though it's not his fault. I just wish I felt like I was getting as much as I'm putting in. I've given up everything for him. I mean, let's face it. If I really wanted a boyfriend here, I could probably have one. Even if it was Brent. Instead of buying clothes and CD's with my paycheck, almost all of it goes in the bank for car and gas money. Every free weekend I have, the first thing I do is see if we can get together. But the answer is always no. I'm fighting a losing battle here. And for once, I just want to win."

This weekend was homecoming. I had an amazing time. I wasn't looking forward to it at all, until Friday. Leah and Alex came over before the game, I went to the game with Brent, I went to Alex's before the dance, I went to the dance with Brent, and I went to Jenny's after the dance. It was so much fun. The game was great. When I found Brent we basically talked and screamed and stuff the whole time. Saturday I got to school at nine and built decorations. I hung out at Alex and Leah's tourney until about four, with Robbie, and got my hair done at Alex's. Got dressed and did my makeup at Alex's and Dad picked me up. I have to say, for one of the very few times in my life, I felt gorgeous. My hair was perfect. My makeup was perfect. I taped my dress up and it fit perfect. I really did look good. So we picked up Ben and Brent at Ben's and went to the Dells. Got to the dance and I had an absolutely amazing time. It was ridiculous. I danced all night. Brent didn't dance, but he seemed alright with standing behind me, watching me. So you know, whatever works. They only had five or six slow dances, but it was all good. Brent had to slouch down quite a bit and I literally had to stand on my tiptoes, but it was super sweet. So I took some great pictures with a bunch of people, then we went back to Jenny's. I seriously had the most amazing time ever. I'll admit, last year really pretty much sucked for me. But this year was amazing. 

So that was the happy part of my post.

The not so good part of my post won't be too complainy today. I just miss Troy. I'm getting scared again. I haven't talked to him for almost a week now. I think the last time we talked was about the...well, the thing...I'm nervous. I really wanna talk to him about homecoming but I don't want to just go out and ask him. I was thinking about it, and before I got invited to Jenny's I did want to go get drunk somewhere, just because I was so depressed and could really use a night to relax and have fun and forget about all the shit going on. But I'm glad I didn't. I just...I don't know...I'm sure he had plenty of opportunities to do lots of bad stuff...getting drunk, getting laid, getting some kind of action...I just hope he didn't. I mean, I trust him. But you know...He's not the same anymore. I don't care if he got drunk. It's homecoming. But drunk people do stupid things. I'd hate for him to make out with someone and realize how easy it would be to have a girlfriend there. I easily could have made out with Brent. Or at least, kissed him. But I didn't. And, I don't know, Troy's not himself anymore. I've been thinking about this so much lately. It's driving me insane. I fell in love with the boy at the fair. But that boy and Troy right now are not the same person. And I know it's not his fault. Don't think I'm blaming him in any way because I know it's not his fault. But this isn't the guy I fell in love with. When we're together, I know everything's perfect. He seems exactly like he used to be. But online and on the phone, there's nothing there. Nothing. Sometimes it's so hard to say I love you. I know that sounds terrible. And I know I love him to death. But I'm in love with Troy. Not Troy on meds. Not depressed Troy. Troy Cleven. My skater boy. My Troy. 

.......You can't love two people.

So what do I do? Accept that he is who he is now and that's not changing back? Or keep up my optimism in thinking that someday things will go back to the way they were? I'm helpless.

"event","I talked to Alex today. Explained/apologized for being such a bitch these past couple weeks. I still don't think she really gets it, but whatever. At least if they think it's only my fault, I'll be forgiven and hopefully stuff won't suck quite so much anymore. I don't think anyone's really realized what's been going on, though. I mean, Liz has a million friends. She really does. So it's not like she 'needs' me. And, I don't know, I just feel so inferior when I'm around them. Like they're just that much better than me and I'm really pretty much useless. I hate feeling like that. I hate feeling like I'm not needed. Or..maybe it's not so much needed as it is wanted....I don't know. It's complicated. But everything Liz and I seem to have had last year seems completely gone because she's moved on and found better people. And I'm not in denial here, or anything. I get the basic facts. I see it how it is, not biased either way. I know there are people a million times more fun to be around than me. Biffy. Liz and Biffy have always been best friends. And I mean, if I was Liz, and something better came along, I'd probably take it too. I can't even deny that. If I was friends with me when there was someone like Biffy around, I'd leave me too. I'm not saying Liz isn't a good friend, because she is, I just, I don't know. I understand why, even though it sucks. She's friends with people from ever clique in the school. Every group. Every grade. She knows everyone and they all love her. I can understand why. (I hate that I sound like the jealous friend, I'm really not.) I'm not jealous, I'm just kind of hurt. Like the realization that there are people so much more fun to be with than me out there and, hell, I'd wanna hang out with them instead too. I think the thing that's been bugging me most is the fact that I don't want to be mad at them, I just am. And I'm not mad, I'm just...I feel like they don't really care. I mean, they're my friends. My best friends. I know that. I just feel so inferior. Like I don't belong talking to them. They've got their million friends and I have mine. Alex has volleyball, Liz has her social life, and I have my computer. God I'm a loser. I've been so bitchy lately and I can't stand myself. I go home from school and I'm just pissed at everyone because I just feel mediocre. They don't hate me, but it's not like they go out of their way to say hi. Not saying they have to, but a little conversation would be nice, I guess. And Alex said it's because I sound surprised everytime they talk to me. I realized that. But in all honesty, I was surprised. I know they're my friends but sometimes it's like I'm a backup. When someone needs ice cream Kati's suddenly their best friend. When they're so upset they can't talk to them we can actually have a conversation, but when their problem is fixed, there are better people to move onto. I know I'm being a drama queen. But it's my fucking journal. And I'm just sick of feeling second best. 

And if they're my best friends, why didn't they talk to me? I realize I have been a bitch, but instead of stopping communication entirely, would it really have been that big of a deal to talk to me about it? I realized it was happening, but I never would have guessed they would. I just assumed I was right. That they HAD realized I'm not essential, and even though we've been friends forever, there are better people out there. But they knew. They talked to each other about it. And I guess they were just waiting for me to apologize. Well...I did. And they all lived happily ever after.

Bull. Fucking. Shit.

I know tonight, as soon as I go home, I'll be dealing with the same shit as last night. And the night before. I wish I could control it. But I don't know how. I can't stop it. I can't make myself stop crying. I can't take away this horrible feeling like I'm not good enough for everyone. I feel like I'm just being used in school. Like everyone uses me as a friend when they need gum or when they have a problem, and once it's solved, they've got better people to move on to. And once again I'm totally useless to everyone. Until the next person needs something anyway...God I hate feeling like this. I know they're my friends and I know they probably do care, but they have one hell of an interesting way of showing it. I hate crying. I hate feeling so goddamn sorry for myself. I hate coming home and having nothing to do but cry or complain to someone about how my feelings are hurt. But no one understands. No one. No one gets what it's like to have Troy in the condition he's in and have him so far away. No one understands how much I need to be with him. They all say the exact same thing. It's my fault. I'm doing this to myself and probably to him. If I really cared about him, I'd dump him. I'd move on. And he'd be much happier. How the fuck can they say that? How would they have any idea how much I care about him? I love him. I know it's wrong and I know I'm not supposed to be in love and I know I'll just end up with my heart broken but I don't care. I love him. Saying ""it doesn't matter"" to me that we're a million miles apart and I never see him would be somewhat of a lie. It does matter. It kills me. But it's not stopping me. It hasn't stopped me for the past year and it's not stopping me now. I am not giving up on him. I love him. I don't care if I never have another first kiss. I don't care if I only sleep with one person in my life. I don't care if I never have the normal life everyone wants. And I know it's not gonna turn out like that. I'm not that naive. But I'd give it all for that boy. 

For some reason, this venting is helping a bit.

I love Troy Cleven.

Argh. 

So now I feel a tiny bit better. I think I've been doubting this for so long, I just needed to hear myself say it. So I said it. I need to finish my Creative Writing stuff. I'll continue these useless posts later.

"event","Ohh I have not been good lately. Everything has just seemed to suck. Ever since I got in that fight with Dad, I've been depressed and I can't really seem to shake it. Last night I went nuts. Started out okay. I got really bored, so I did my homework. Listened to the Fray for a while. But all of a sudden, I got really depressed again. I don't really know what triggered it, but I was afraid to call Troy. I wanted to around 6:30. but I didn't call until eight. I don't know what was the matter with me, but I was so scared to call him. I couldn't pick up the phone. It was horrible. Ben finally sort of coaxed me into it, and I  talked to him for about 25 minutes. He's really not  doing well. I wish there was something I could do. He just sounded so...distant. So not like him the last time I saw him. He was so happy, so much fun, when I was with him at Devil's Lake. But last night, he seemed almost....I don't want to say cold, but so empty. So far away. Like it just wasn't him. I miss him so much. And last night, instead of taking away all the pain of him being so far away, I just felt even worse. I don't know what to think anymore. Realistically, I know I can't do anything. But I still feel like I should. Like it's my responsibility to find a way to get to him. Like I need to start taking more drastic measures to do everything I can to get up there. I don't know. If there was a way, I'm sure I would have figured it out by now. It's been so long. So anyway, I hung up the phone last night when he left, sat there for a minute, and broke down. Really bad. I couldn't stop crying. I don't even know how long I laid there. But I could not stop crying. It was horrible. I'm completely miserable. I don't know what was so wrong with me but I could not for the life of me make everything stop. And it just got worse. I did some stuff I'm extremely not proud of, that I really dont think I should go into detail of, but it really wasn't good. So when I finally stopped crying and got myself under control, I got online and started talking to a couple people, one of them being John from Milwaukee. And I don't know how, but he actually made me feel so much better. It's weird, how I can't trust my own friends, but I completely broke down online to this guy from Milwaukee? A senior guy from Milwaukee? I guess it's because he wouldn't have anyone to tell, so it's not like it would matter, whatever I told him. I don't know what was wrong with me. I still don't know what's wrong with me. I still can't stop feeling like I'm totally useless anymore. Like there's no reason for me to be here. I don't know where to go anymore. I just don't know.....

"event","Homecoming is a lost  cause. It's been decided. If no one's asked me by now, I don't think they will. So it looks like I'm flying solo once again. I can tell you one thing though. I am damn determined to dance with someone at every slow song. I don't care who it is, I don't care how old they are, I don't care if they're shorter than me and ugly as hell. I am gonna fucking dance with someone 'cause dammit, I'm gonna have a good time. 

Well now that that frustration is out..

Pictures were today. I'm pretty sure mine didn't turn out too hot. My smile was ungodly cheesy and she messed up my hair. I guess my clothes were cute, but my hair was all icky and flat and I didn't do a supremely good job on my makeup...oh well. 

I have homework. I'm really not supposed to be doing this right now, seeing as I have to write a short story or something for creative writing. It's supposed to be a memoir, but it can be in any form. I have no idea what I'm gonna do yet, but I guess that's what study hall is for...

I'm working tomorrow. Not at all excited. 7 till 2. Which means seven straight hours of entertaining those demonic beasts because they'll all be awake and cranky by the time I get there, and it's an extra hour till I get to leave. GOD DAMN IT! I hate my job. I hate it so much. And I will be making a whopping $56 dollars (note sarcasm) in addition to whatever I make playing piano at Dino's. Sigh..I'm poor. I'm -$13 right now. I have no money whatsoever.

This post sucks. I apologize who all attempting to read it. I think I'm just gonna give up now.

"event","So I'm pretty much sick of everything being exactly the same everyday. Really, I must be THE most boring person I've ever encountered. I don't do anything. ANYTHING. I wake up, go to school, come home from school, go to a volleyball game if there is one, get online, talk to a million people, and go to bed. That's it. Yesterday, the highlight of my day was getting to Walmart and purchasing The Fray, whom I am absolutely and entirely in love with. The album came out yesterday and I must say I was probably one of the first people to buy it. Yaaaay for The Fray because I am totally and 100% in love with them. Doesn't even matter that they are in no way hardcore, because their lyrics make me wanna smile and cry at the same time and the piano makes me all warm and toasty. It's a fantastic feeling, listening to them. I don't know why but it is. Cable Car has been in my head all freaking day. 'Tis a lovely song. Makes me all giggly. Yay. I bought Fall Out Boy yesterday, also. Mi hermana y yo rocked out hardcore in the car coming back from her physical therapy. That's my jam song. Ohh yeah.

So Troy is not coming to homecoming. I was somewhat crushed but I still feel guilty about freaking out on him last year, so I pretended like it was no big deal. It didn't seem like it really was to him, so why should it be that big of a deal to me? I was really calm, I just ""aww""-ed and told him he owed me a dance. So we're square. But the thing that really made it all okay was the fact that he told his parents. I don't know if they found out on their own or if he came right out and asked, but I guess I'm just really happy it's somewhat out in the open now. At first, I tried convincing myself I liked the whole dirty little secret thing we had going on, but then it sorta hit me that it wasn't exactly...flattering. I don't know, I guess the whole Tim thing sorta had me against it. I mean, Tim denied to his best friend that we were going out, and the next thing I know he's cheating on me. I guess I didn't want the same thing happening over again. But I really don't give Troy enough credit. I automatically assume the worst ALL the time so I don't get hurt. But I dont' think that's fair to him. I mean, I was under the impression that none of his friends knew I was in existence, let alone his girlfriend. But what it sounds like now is just that he hasn't told them, but he hasn't NOT told them. I don't know. Maybe I'm just being naive or maybe I'm assuming the worst. I don't know. But the important thing now I guess is that his mom knows. Which means a few things, I think. One, that I won't have to me completely terrified of calling his house anymore. Two, I'll be able to at least decently say goodbye to him. And three, this could possibly mean easier negotiations for us seeing each other. Oh, and apparently, Troy's dad told him he should marry me. I can't imagine what made him randomly say that one day, but, hell, maybe it ain't such a bad idea. Ha. Just kidding. But really, I think it's hilarious. Especially the way Troy told me. A completely random statement. ""My dad told me I should marry you."" And for some ungodly strange reason, reading the words ""I should marry you"" gave me butterflies....

So at the moment, I desperately need a date for homecoming. I want to be asked so bad but I can't think of a single person that would ask me. Corey asked last night, but he meant to come with me. I don't exactly know how that would work, seeing as there are about a million things standing in the way. Number one being Alex and Liz, because I know they'd probably be pissed. Simply because I have a boyfriend and Corey really likes me and I don't know, it's weird? I mean, I wouldn't mind going with Corey but at the same time, I don't want him to get the wrong impression. We absolutely can't be more than friends. And seriously, I don't wanna be dancing with him thinking about how much my feet hurt in those god awful heels if he's thinking about how he can't have me. He said something like that the other night. Like he couldn't stop thinking about me and can't have me and all that jazz. I don't know what to do, because it's my fault he asked. I made some sarcastic comment online. I think I told him if he didn't have a date and if our homecomings weren't on the same night, I'd totally ask him. But I wasn't entirely serious. And, being the moron that I am, he doesn't have a date to his anymore and asked me last night if I'd ""mind if he went with me."" I was so shocked I told him if it would work and if we could bring out-of-school dates, I would. WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING? I didn't consider any of the things like him liking me or the fact of how insanely awkward it would be or ANYTHING! I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do but I better figure it out soon.

Advice? Hit me up.

"event","Yay for Thursday. Why? 'Cause tomorrow's Friday! Friday means the weekend! Yaaaay. I'm in a supremely good mood today and I'm not sure why. But I'm diggin it. Yes.

So I'm supposed to be doing my student council essay (What really IS the rule of the student council and how will I improve my class and my school? Question of the day) but of course, I'm not. Why bother? I'll make up some crappy thing tomorrow and the world shall be swell. It's not like it's gonna determine whether or not I make it. So I'll continue to procrastinate, as always. Yay for procrastination. Yay for laziness. And yay for llamas.

So I had a really great conversation with Troy last night. Told him I was working on lies to get him here for homecoming. He laughed. It was good. My whole little shpeel (I don't know how to spell that but that's how it sounds) ended up with an ""mm, I love you"" from him so I considered myself well-accomplished. I just wish he could be like that all the time. I know he can't, but he's such a total sweetheart and I miss that like crazy when he's all depressed. I wish there was more I could do. But I really just don't know. 

So Corey's coming on Saturday. We're gonna hang out and probably go see a movie. Yay Corey. Should be a mildly interesting Saturday, due to the fact that my last few have left me with a few obnoxious children and a large puddle of drool on my lap. So this is most definetely a good thing. 

I'm so optimistic today. It's really weird. Usually I always think of something to make my day not as good as it could be, but today I'm just full of happy. Crazy, but very nice indeed. For example. Today I'm getting a bunch of Netflix in the mail. Tomorrow there's a tiny chance I'll get some other form of mail. Saturday Corey's coming. I'm rarely this optimistic about stuff but it's put me in one hell of a good mood. 

Well, I'm off. Time to finish la tarea. Hasta luego chicos y chicas.

"event","It's been forever. An insanely long time since I last posted. Time to get back into the old habit, I suppose. Where shall I start...

I'm back in school. My schedule's fine, I have friends in all my classes. Seems like this year won't be too bad. Hopefully. 

I'm going nuts about homecoming already. I have my dress and my jewelry and I'm gonna stick with the shoes I had last year, seeing as I'll only wear them for an hour or so. I asked Troy, he said he would but I doubt it'll happen. I need a place for him to stay, a way to get him here, and his parental approval. As of right now, that seems to be a problem, seeing as I doubt he'll tell them. I guess I understand, if he gets half the criticism I do for having a long distance relationship, I guess if they haven't found out by now I would want to keep it a secret too. But whatever...I want a date this year but I want him most of all. Guess all I can do now is wait...

I've been somewhat of an emotional basketcase lately. Saturday night I was home alone and had a complete breakdown. Don't know what came over me, really. I was gonna go to the movies with a bunch of people at 9:30 and at about quarter to nine I ended up sitting on the kitchen floor holding a picture of Mom, unable to stop crying. It was bad. I saw her picture on the fridge and for some reason it hit me harder than it normally does seeing pictures of her. It wasn't pretty. But anyway, we went to see Four Brothers, which was probably the worst movie I've ever seen, for multiple reasons. For starters, the movie was about four foster brothers whose mother is killed. Perfect timing. The whole movie was full of gang shootings and beating people up and all kinds of stuff, and the hot one died in the end. I mean, come on. That was just the clincher for making it the worst movie ever. But oh well. My point is, Saturday night was not exactly the best night for me. But life goes on.

I keep getting called cute. It's wonderful. VF if my new favorite website ever because the peope are so nice. it's insanity. I always thought I was cute because I was tiny, but I guess I'm finally somewhat satisfied with the way I look. EXCEPT for my hair. It's ridiculous. I've gotten it to look good once, at about midnight last Thursday night. Since then, it's a hopeless case. I can't decide whether to trim my bangs a little bit and stick with them, or grow them out. At the moment, neither is going to look very good, and I have pictures on the 16th. Lord...

I've decided that Troy is gonna take my senior pictures. Or, I'm gonna ask him anyway....but I made up my mind. I know it's not till the end of next year, a hell of a long time away, but that's okay. I was just thinking about that and decided that's how it's gonna go down. Meanwhile, I've sort of been getting into the whole photography thing myself lately. More than I was before. I bought a black and white camera when we were on vacation and got some really good shots of Sam and Erin. My plan for my room sometime in the future is to repaint where I messed up that poetry and do it over so it looks really good. Then I'm gonna take some good black and white pictures, blow them up a little bit, and frame them in black frames and hang them up. I really want my room to be unique and kinda artsy. Basically I just want it to look me. Not that I'm artsy in any way, but I think with the photography and the poetry it'll look really cool. Assuming I ever finish it. But the one thing I really want is a black and white picture of people kissing. I know it sounds bizzare, and I don't want full-on making out, just kissing. I'd love to have it be me and Troy, but I'd need someone to take the picture. I just think it would look really cool from the right angle. And of course, in black and white. Ha, I'm such a loser. 

I really miss Troy lately. Even more than usual. It's just been one of those things where everything reminds me of him. And there's someone at school that has the same cologne or whatever he uses and it smells so good. Just that little reminder that he's not here...I miss him. 

Well I better get going. Half hour left of study hall but I have chem to study for. More shall be written later.

"event","Leave it to me to always see the bad, never the good. To take the worst instead of the best. The other day, when I was having my breakdown, all I saw were the negatives. My glass was half empty. Everything I love about him was completely blocked out by my own selfish little complaints. I freaked out because in the beginning, I thought he was falling for Jess. What I didn't remember was that he told me he loved me and that it wouldn't change. I always make him out to be such a bad person, but he's not. I don't know anyone who's had the kind of patience that he has for me. I do exactly what everyone in any grief counseling or support group has told me not to do. To keep everything bottled up. I don't tell people stuff. I lay in bed and try to figure out what's so wrong with me. I look at his picture and suddenly, burst into tears for no reason. I read every conversation I have saved and wonder why we can't do that anymore. I'm so narrow-minded anymore. Instead of realizing that talking from so far away is hard for him, I complain that I don't get any affection anymore. I completely looked past all the little things that meant so much at the time. The kisses on my forehead. Holding me. Looking right in my eyes and then kissing me. Those are the things that matter, not saying ""I love you"" instead of ""love ya."" I freaked out about him and Jess having a thing, when the thought never occurred to me that he's stuck with me forever. He never broke things off, I did. I'm the one that broke down on my birthday and made him look like the bad guy. I'm the one that's started any little conflict we ever might have had. I'm the one that immediately thought ""he's trying to tell me something"" when he had Jess all over his bp profile. I just got myself worked up that I never took the time to realize he was the one that kissed me first. He's the one that shows up and surprises me. At Christmas, I was the one that was afraid to kiss him because he had a girlfriend and I had a boyfriend. He didn't care. He took the chance. I was afraid. My fear of rejection almost got between me and the guy I love. He took the chance. I've been so shallow. He has always been there for me. He has never let me down. He has never meant to hurt me. The only thing I've done is hurt myself. I can't control that I'm an emotional rollercoaster. I can't control getting depressed for a week straight and not knowing why. I can't control half of my emotions, I can only sit back and let them control how I live my life. I wish I could learn to relax. He's so laid back and lately I'm so high strung. I'm afraid to just let go because I'm so scared of not being good enough. If I could just learn to relax, I'd feel better about blaming him for my own mistakes. I really do feel terrible. I put him through so much, because I'm an emotional headcase. I just hope he knows how much I love him. I know I'm a drama queen and I know I go crazy sometimes, but it's only because I'm so afraid of losing him. He's become my everything.

"event","Troy, babe, what are you doing to me here? I'm so confused anymore. I don't know how you're doing this to me. You had me hooked since the day we met and I just can't let go. Even though I'm hurting. This relationship at times, seems like it's done more bad to me than good. I don't know anymore. I mean, you're sitting there, probably thinking about Jess, while I'm trying to find a way to ask you to Homecoming and for it to work out. You're sitting there jacking off to her picture as I'm looking at yours with tears in my eyes, wondering what ever happened to the boy I met at the fair. I dream about you, you're probably dreaming about Jess. I mean, yeah, I'll admit, I'm jealous of her. I'm intimidated by her. She gets all your love and attention that I so desperately crave. I've given everything for this. I put my heart out. I've put my whole self, my everything on the line, only to be shot down. I don't understand where I went wrong. I've never felt this way for anyone. I don't know if I ever will. But babe, you're two different people. When I'm with you, you're so cute. So funny. So adorable. You treat me like a princess and that's when I know I'm the luckiest girl in the world. That's the boy I fell in love with. But online, you're a totally different person. You're so distant. So detatched. I feel like there's no affection. Our conversations are totally one-sided. I babble randomly and pointlessly at nothing and you answer with lol or k. I just don't know how much longer I can take this. When I'm with you, that's when I realize it's worth it. Being with you for an hour is worth every last pointless conversation we've tried and failed at. But it's the waiting that absolutely kills me. The uncertainty I have that this will last another day. I wish life worked like it does in the movies. Where you meet your soulmate when you're fifteen. When the only fights you have are petty arguments that are made up an hour later. Where it's okay to have sex because you never have to worry about them leaving you. But I know better. I know it doesn't work like that in the real world. And that's why I'm so afraid. I'm afraid of rejection. I'm afraid to be alone. I'm afraid of losing people I love. And I'm afraid of not being good enough. I wish life was easy. I wish you didn't have to think twice about losing your virginity to the guy you love. Because in a perfect world, he'll be there for you forever. It won't be a mistake. You won't get pregnant. And he won't ever decide he could do better and leave you with a baby. A constant reminder of how much you still love him, and how much he no longer cares. In a perfect world, going out some night and getting dead drunk only means the boy of your dreams taking you home and putting you to bed. Breakups only mean getting back together with more love and passion than before. A broken heart only means that guy showing up at your door with one hundred red roses. I don't want perfection. Perfection only means disappointment in the end. All I want is to know that you really do care. That I'm not just a friend with benefits whenever you're in Portage. That I mean half as much to you as you do to me. I don't need a thousand roses and for you to sit outside my bedroom window singing. I just need to know you're there. And right now, you're anywhere but here.

I know you will never read this, but at least I'm getting it off my chest.

For starters, Dad shot down my plan about Weezer and Troy. Completely. Said he didn't like the idea of a guy here and it was inappropriate. Grr. I wish I didn't get all Kati about it. Thinking about it for the past week and thinking I might actually have a shot at it. But ohhh no. It doesn't work like that at Kati's house. Rawr.

On the brighter side, I totally lost it on the Jess thing. Troy didn't even know about the stuff in his profile. He told her to make his profile cool and all she did was put herself in it a bunch of times. He asked me if I got all worried and I confessed I nearly went crazy. He told me I had to tell him when I start freaking out like that, and I know I need to, but I feel bad asking. I don't wanna be the insane, jealous girlfriend, that doesn't allow him to put other girls in his profile. But it's okay. Everything's settled now, and I can finally stop freaking out about it. 

So I'm working on a new plan for Summerfest/Troy. It will most likely fail miserably, but I'm pulling a Kati and trying anyway. I gotta go now.

I'm teaching myself how to play guitar. I know I said I was gonna play bass, but not having an amp was very frustrating. I looked all over online until I found some actual instructions, and when I finally did, I printed them out and started. Took me a half hour to tune it, but it was about 4 key signatures off. So now Kati has an acoustic guitar. And I can play three chords! Yay! Hurts like hell, though. My hands are really tiny and my fingers barely reach all the way around it. So I'll have to work on some finger-growing exercises. Meanwhile, I'll work on my three chords and learn more chords and hopefully be able to play Swing Life Away because it's adorable and I love it.

"event","I haven't updated in a while. Like really actually updated. I suppose it's time to bore you all with my life the past few days. Hmm. But where oh where do I begin?

For starters, my bedroom is a lovely shade of hot pink. The carpet is still pukey yellow, but the walls are bright pink. I wrote poetry all over them, I have to admit they do look semi-cool. I'm getting a cover for my comforter made right now. It's going to be bright pink and I want to get some big black, plastic buttons for it. It'll be neato, I guarantee. I have almost no furniture anymore and I need to find something to store my clothes. But right now, no luck. 

Driving is going fantastically. I drove for an hour this weekend up in Minocqua. Dad told me I'm ""ready for traffic"" but I'm not so sure. I'm still not fantastic with straightening out in time. Anyway, if I had to make a lane change, I'd probably keel over at the wheel. It's a scary thought right now, it really is. 

So I talked to Dad quite a while this weekend. Friday night all the kiddies were asleep so me and him went outside by the fire. This was in Minocqua at Greg and Lynn's cabin. We talked for about an hour, and I thought he was finally beginning to understand me. And understand the stuff I write. And understand why...well why I am the way I am, I guess. But today he had to ""approve"" more of my stuff and he told me it sounded too depressing. Like I got my feelings hurt and in six months I'd regret writing it. Well, six months ago I felt the same as I do now. I'm thinking in another six months I'll still be feeling the same way. Ugh, he'll never understand me.

As far as me and Troy go, it's a freaking rollercoaster. I want to see him and I want to be with him so much, but he's so distant. I can't tell if it's the medication or if we're really drifting apart. I hope to God it's not the second one. The thought of being alone scares me to death.

So the whole Mary Pape Saga is alright. She's been missing for 20 days now, and they found her. Finally. She was in Missouri. I don't know why. She said she didn't even know anyone was looking for her, but honestly, how can you expect to just leave without telling anyone and not have people looking? I thought for sure she was gone for good. That she had either run away or that she was drinking again and...ugh I don't even want to think anything else. Thank God she's alright. 

I'm quite abused from this weekend up north. My legs are bruised from tubing/waterskiing and of course, falling on my face over the steps. Ahh, classic me. My scalp is so sunburnt I couldn't wash my hair this morning. I had to take a cold shower because the rest of me hurt so bad. My knees are bright red and my back is streaked. Someone missed a part of my back when they were sunscreen-ing me so it's red, white, and red striped. Very sexy. 

I have a job. Yes, yes I do. You're talking to Kati the Nanny. Bleck. I'm working Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. 5-10, 5-10, and 7-2. Meh. I really do need the money though, so I guess I'll just have to live with it.

Well I'm thinking this was long enough. I had a salad for dinner and some fruit for lunch and I'm really quite starving. 

love always"

you didn't hear my cry.
you didn't see me hit the ground.
you didn't feel me break.
guess what
i'm broken.
i thought you'd see me.
they watched me bleed 
but they wouldn't pick me up.
you walked by
and became one of them.
i whispered your name
but you didn't hear me.
you kept walking.
guess what
i'm still here.
still bleeding.
still cold.
still empty.
i'm waiting.
i thought you'd come back.
guess what
you didn't.
now i'm gone.
my body is gone
but my soul never left.
i waited too long.
i waited for you
but you just didn't see.
she blinded you and
i faded away into the concrete.
but my blood is still there.
and maybe someday
you'll realize what you left behind.
i cared.
but you closed your eyes
and i faded.


Do I want to know the truth? Or will what I don't know save me the hearbreak?"

Thursday I got my temps. 7:00 in the morning, I was at the DMV, taking my test. I only got four out of the 65 questions wrong! Yes. I'm great. So the driving's going pretty good. Except for my totally and completely unsupportive family, who sees me driving not as a possibility, but as a fun way to make fun of me. Erin bugged me all day to let her come with (still in the parking lot) so finally I said yes. We got to school, I got in the driver's seat, put on my seatbelt, look over my shoulder, and Erin is sitting there with her hockey helmet on. No lies. My family is terrible. Apparently, she and my brother AND my dad have been planning this for months. I'm hurt. But it was quite funny and I felt like I won after she started to complain about how boring it was. Yes, Kati always wins. 

So yesterday, I still didn't do much. Slept a while, I guess. Went to Alex's Thursday night and watched Out Cold and had virgin margaritas with Liz. Fun stuff. Last night I went to Ashley's. I had the best time EVER. It started raining and we decided to go outside. It was stormy and awesome. It was the kind of rain like in a hurricane, coming down really hard and really fast and the wind was like whoa. So it started thundering and we kept running around and having fun. Then we decided it would be fun to complete a life goal. So we danced in the rain. Then it lightning-ed and we got scared so we ran inside. Then we put on pajamas and went to Culvers. On the way there, we saw this monster puddle and decided we had to jump in it. So on the way back, we jumped in the ginormous puddle in the street. It was about 10 or 10:30, I think. So after we jumped around a little bit, being our dorky selves, Ash was standing on the sidewalk and I was standing in the middle of the giant puddle, and Ash's dad comes driving by and completely, I mean COMPLETELY, soaks me. It was like a tidal wave. Ash missed it, but I got the full blow. Holy man. That was some cold, nasty puddle water. But we still kept jumping. 

So then, I got this crazy impulse to go streaking. Not even kidding. I don't know what came over me, but I decided I wanted to go streaking. So after splashing a bit more in the giant puddle, me and Ashley stripped off our shirts and ran down the street. It was the funnest thing I have ever done. So we were running, full speed, down Ashley's hopefully deserted street, and I couldn't get my soaking wet t-shirt back on! The sleeve was all messed up and we're getting closer to the Boeck's, and I couldn't get it back on! I finally stopped running and got it over my head, but it took quite a bit of effort. That was by far the most awesome, most daring, and most crazy adreneline rush I possibly have ever had. It was super cool. Kudos to Ashley for allowing herself to be peer pressured into something that insane and impulsive. It was freaking awesome.

So after some shots of diet pepsi and crunchy corn muffins, we fell asleep watching Anchorman. Too bad I still haven't gotten to see it. Guess the streaking sort of wore me out. Ha. So life goals accomplished were: dance in the rain, jump in a huge puddle, and go streaking. YES! I amaze myself. Oh and p.s, for a real caffeine rush, Diet Pepsi Shots are the way to go.

So today when I came home, I got a call from the person I sent that nanny application to. Honestly, I thought she would think I was absolutely insane, applying for a nanny job at 15, but hey, I'm desperate. So anyway, she called me back and gave me the scoop. The scoop is that she has four kids, 7 year old girl, twin 5 year old boys, and a 2 year old boy. Yikes. Also, the days would be every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Thursdays and Fridays from 5:15 A.M. to about 9:30 or 10:00. Saturdays would be until about 2:00. And then a few hours some other days. I'm supposed to have an interview with her tomorrow. I know it's not exactly a ""real job"" but I'm that desperate. So if the kids like me and if she likes me, I guess I have a pretty good shot at it. I still don't know what I'm getting paid or if the kids are absolute nightmares, but I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

Mi hermano y mi abuela estan en New York. Mi padre sale ir a la New York lunes. YAY!!

Just finished my Computer Apps final, though. It was easy enough. I think I got everything alright, unless I really messed up the spreadsheet. But I think I did okay. Spanish I got a 99%. Yesssss. Way to go me. So anyways, the most exciting news ever...

I GOT TO DRIVE LAST NIGHT! 

Yes, yes, it is true. Kati had her first ever driving lesson last night in the PHS parking lot. I suck at turning. Haha. But seriously. I think I'm gonna be one of those really slow learners and really cautious drivers. I'm already like a little old lady as is, sitting on my phone book, peeking over the steering wheel. Ha, just kidding. It's not QUITE that bad. I did, however, need to pull the seat way up. WAY up. But it's all good. I was driving! So me and Dad had a nice little bonding experience. We finished my little lesson and then had ice cream at Culvers. Yay. This morning he was being really nice, too. He left way early this morning and called to say good morning, just as I was heading out the door. Smile. Nice. So I have a half hour left of class. Then I have to go take my English final, which should be interesting for all. And tonight, lucky me, I get to spend the night with the grandparents. Oh yes, I am a lucky girl. They'll feed me healthy, balanced meals, and some nice breakfast tomorrow, because a healthy breakfast is the best way to start the day. They will most likely shove grapefruit down my throat, then some orange juice, then some calcium-enriched waffles, then some toast, then some bacon, then some apple slices, and what the heck, why not a T-bone steak? Lordy. Nine chances out of ten they'll also take me out to dinner tonight, somewhere far away and expensive, filled with rich old folks who like to come just for the beauty of the drive there. Oh poor little Kati. The worst part is, no talking to anyone tonight. Because they don't have MSN. The closest I can get it AIM, but no one's on there anyways. Oh sad. Well I must get going. More interesting update to come.

Ugh I'm so tired. I have computer apps and english finals tomorrow. I'll have absolutely no energy left by the time I have them tomorrow. Computer apps doesn't sound too overly challenging if I do a little bit of studying and reviewing stuff from forever ago. English should be fairly easy, except for the essay. There will be a lot of thinking involved and a lot of writer's block and writers cramp because I always write way more than I'm supposed to. Tonight I want to talk to Troy. Very badly. I need to think of a bunch of stuff right away and remember them because I'm so sick of these lame ass conversations we keep having night after night after night. It's terrible. I need to read my drivers ed chapters tonight too, because I'm sure I wont do it tomorrow or Wednesday. Dieck wasn't here today so I couldn't find out what my grade was on my final. If I don't go from a B+ to an A I'm screwed. They even hate when I get A-'s so I don't  know what will happen if I get another B+. They might just lock me up. Bleck. Well I guess I better get studying or doing something else, my eyes are killing. Later days.

I wore my chucks with my skirt today.
Got quite a few weird looks in the hall.
But my confidence must be sky high because that took guts.
The grand-parental unit told me I looked ""chic"".
Then she told me I looked cute.
Then she told me she liked the skirt and the top.
And that she admired me for wearing the shoes.
Probably because I looked so nerdy.
But it's okay.
I realize my confidence has tripled since the start of school.
But now I'm home and starting to feel quite unhappy again.

Apparently, I'm a romantic kisser, my true love's name starts with A-E (Cleven, hopefully). Haha. Oh yeah, and my sex dessert is chocolate sauce. Meh heh heh. Needless to say, I was quite bored. 

So this week I must find a job. Bleck. I don't want a job. I want to be free...free as the wind...I think that's might just be a song...but anyways, me and Ben are gonna go job hunting, I suppose. I don't know where I'm gonna work yet, but the sooner I'm employed the sooner I can paint my room. Yessss. Score. 

I'm having the worst s'more craving right now. I want one soooo bad. I want a campfire and a big bag of marshmallows and like, 6 bars of chocolate and some graham crackers and ooooh I want lunch. 45 minutes. I can do this. My stomach keeps making hungry noises. I'm not liking it. Right now I'm sort of thinking some calorie-packed McDonalds sounds pretty damn tasty. Maybe I can go after school or something and get some fries.

It started as a crush. He was the boy she met at the fair. Dark eyes, shaggy hair, great smile. He was a skater. She was 90% good girl. Curly blonde hair and a charming personality. For some strange reason, they hit it off. They talked the whole day. They secretly found out each other's emails and started to talk every night. 
They started as friends. Their friendly conversations started to get longer and more interesting. Their personalities matched perfectly. He was funny in a witty way. She was funny in a dumb blonde way. He teased her all the time, and she loved it. They talked every night. Their friendly conversations turned to sumbtle flirting and ""I-know-you-want-me's"". Every goodbye held a ""love ya"" at the end.
Both were in the dark. He liked her, she liked him. but each was afraid to tell the other for fear of ruining the friendship. Finally, one night, she did. With a simple ""so...I like you."" she spilled the beans. She was horrified that she said it, but glad in the end. Now they knew. Love ya turned to I love you. She questioned what she really felt. She thought it was love.
But they went too fast. It was all too erotic to happen in such a short time. THey didn't talk for a while. He wasn't online. She tried to forget. She thought he lost interest completely. So soon she had a boyfriend. He had a girlfriend. And he toldher he still loved her. They agreed to see each other over Christmas Break. This was the first time in six months. In those few short hours, nothing else in the world existed. It was only him and her. They kissed for the first time in the middle of the food court, neither of them caring that the whole world could have been watching. They went home in a total daze, totally lost in their memories of what had just happened.
Time wore on, and things started to get more intense. What she flet for him was so intense, she wanted it to last forever. She needed security. And with him, she had it all.
She really thought it was love. She had never felt like that about anyone. She trusted him, told him everything, and for the first time in her life, felt like someone cared. What they had seemed like so much more than typical high school relationships. She began to wonder more and more, is this what love really is? Is this the feeling you have for someone you want to be with forever? She knew it didn't work like that. She knew you couldn't meet the person you spend the rest of your life with in high school. Even she wasn't that naive.
But she still thought about it. She knew she would be lost without him. She constantly argued with herself. The optimistic side thought she could make it work. As long as he loved her, she would sacrifice it all for him. But the realistic side kept telling her, over and over again, that she was only 15. She didn't know love. He's just a boy you like. Nothing this perfect will last forever. She didn't know which side to believe. She wanted things to last as long as they could, because she was so happy, but she didn't want to get her heart broken.
Things started to get complicated. His close friend was killed in a car accident. He struggled with depression. She got worried. She felt so helpless. 
Watching him suffer was killing her. She knew he needed someone, but became more and more afraid it wasn't her. She tried to be there for him, cheer him up, get his mind off all of it, but never really knew if it was working. She thought about him constantly. She always overthought and overanalyzed everything, but she still worried about him all the time. She reassured herself he would never do anything stupid, but the thought always lingered in the back of her mind. She just wanted everything to be okay.

I forgot to mention my story does not have an ending.

They went to churh and I went back to bed and slept till noon. The whole right side of my body is unbelieveably sore from laying on the tile for so long. I can't eat anything and I'm absolutely miserable. Ugh. I know, another Kati Sob Story, but I had to complain. Bleck. I think I'm gonna go back to bed now.

Jake's trying to get me ratings on BP but all he's doing is having people tell me I'm weird and give me ones...I appreciate his pity or whatever that I don't have enough tens but..yeah I just asked him to stop and he got mad once again...I just can't do anything right anymore. Meh.

love always"

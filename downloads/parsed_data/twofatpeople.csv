"event","God it is so much work. Maybe it is just my reading ayn rand and becoming the book/author im currently reading (which is crappy of me), but I've been exploring how very few people are truly real to themselves. Some of you, very few of you, have heard me say how picky I am about my lovers (and then ask me if that's only people I have sex with or romantic interests, and I see no difference) and there is a reason. I can't help but look for perfection in my eyes and I dont feel that anyone should do anything else but look for that. Why should you compromise your integrity? Why should you say ""they're good in this way, while not in that...thats good enough, right?""? But the scary thing is I know why. Because maintaining consistency and being true to your convictions is so hard. So many people take the easy way out and stop listening to their own reason in order to live with more people. Fuck that. I will admit now that many of you, most of you, almost all of you get shit for the genuine me. These ljs are roundabout as close as you can get, but even then there are things only sacred enough for me and people who I know can understand them. But nearly everyone, including myself still, will know what is right for them and only them and take the other path anyway because it is simply easier than searching for people that are right, for other genuines. So many will respond to this post and say ""I know what you mean"" and really will, but when they say that they really won't becasue they have succumbed to the unreal so many times and continue to do so knowlingly or unknowingly. There are so many things I've never understood about people, and on some subjects I think it is because they have no reason for being that way (or at least no good reason).
When I was a child I remember the very time I thought this thought, stepping into the shower: I remember wishing their were some teacher to teach me this common sense that everyone had but myself and now I understand that it was because I found little reason in what so many people call ""common sense"". It is incredibly pervasive, this common sense that has little logical bound, and what is anything without logic? what is anything without real reason to do so? why should we sacrifice our own moral codes and our own standards to others? why should the limiting factor always be right?(example, non smokers getting their way simply because they are non smokers, rather than smoking truly being a bad thing because it makes the inevitable happen sooner)When we offer ourselves up to other's scrutiny we become a mirror for every other person out there, when everyone is a mirror of everyone else, the whole of society is so vulnerable to one proactive person's will. When that one person who is not a mirror affects the mirrors, everyone is under their control, and are not able to stand on their own against anything. Constantly, since childhood, have I searched for independance from anyone but myself: being self sufficient in happiness and food and everything, having no moral compromised and quitting the game as soon as it was and beginning one of my own, allowing other's to quit as they please.
But it is so hard casting others aside in this world of our because we are taught not to do so the moment we leap out of the womb, that love is something that is justified by others, that I cannot love someone that hates me because they hate me. Written out, any person would say ""of course you dont!"" and then go on hating those who hate them and loving those who will love them back. When I love, it is because the person deserves it which has no bearing on whether or not they like or dislike me, whether or not we talk or have any earthly bond at all: my lovers simply are, and that is all they have to be. But good lord, it is so difficult to know other's are shared by people who don't deserve them, that they prostrate themselves before the insufficient because they are insufficient and ""deserve"" a leg up they haven't even earned. I know that so many times before and henceforth will I be one of those people, but I will never ask for that leg up, nor will I ever accept one, because no gift is a gift when it is undeserved: it always carries with it a price I refuse to pay - the price of my own integrity and self worth. To pay that price is to give up whatever I believed in and become indebted to those who don't deserve it. I must stay genuine and I must spurn all that would ask of me otherwise, directly or indirectly (which is surprisingly/not surprisingly uncommon), if not in the physical world, than at least inside of myself, knowing that these people cannot have me and never will as long as they walk that path, as long as they ask me to justify them and to let them justify myself. Knowing and, in my own subtle way, never asking for anything else. Gah, this writing is so full of holes....I have so much work to do......the hard part in the whole thing is being your own inquisitor and saying ""you are wrong, be better, you are shit, stop being that"".....the pain is worth it, the pain itself is the affirmation of greatness. I will be great, and I will be great to no one else but me, and that is true greatness.

Avez un bonne nuit, mes amis.
P.S. probably more disconnected shit for you all, but ahh is this a moment of clarity for me, and if you understood what was written above, you'd know in your fibre that is all that matters to myself."

"event","Well, I haven't updated since a long time ago, or something, so I guess its good to keep you posted. I don't think it's really my concern to get my word out at all, but I dunno, this is more like im typing to me and people just so happen to read it. I'd like to equate that to the restaurant, just like I do with everything: tickets flow in and I fulfill them but it's not like I'm making them for customers, it's more like the tickets are telling me to do something and I do them with no concern for what happens to them outside, I make them solely for my enjoyment and people happen to buy them and eat them. Good for those people. Anywho.
So, like always, im changing. This seems to me more of a change thats happening, rather than one I'm affecting in myself. Work is doing it, that and age/biology. I like it, I feel like I have more dignity. Not in the sense of dignity that everyone gives to me, that is a quality of how others look at me, it's from me, it's from work and doing what I do with love and for me and only me. Sure i get paid for it and could get fired if I did it wrong, but thats not the point, the quality of independance is inside of me, and it cannot be squelched or changed. I like that.
Life has been hard and I like a challenge, the pain I've been feeling is making me resilient, is giving me context for what the pain is, and it's been good. Good in the way that bucking trees all day and then lying down in your bed and feeling your body ache is good, tired to the bones from using your body good. I'm envious of my college bound friends though, and I want to do that soon. And I need to travel, and I need to learn, and I need to study philosophy/martial arts. My true passions. God damn thats a lot of work, but I guess being true to yourself and looking drectly into your own soul and browbeating yourself over your passions really are. Good god, I will have a wonderful life in spite of anything that happens to me, as long as I can stay genuine to me, I'll never thirst.
Good night, guys.
P.S. man this is a load of disconnected shit."

totally saw that one comin
So today's entry is about judo. The above is one of the many wordings of the thought and nature that exists as the maxim of judo. I have come to understand that the progression of belts in any martial art is to signify the diminuation of the gap between your life and that maxim. Worded better, becoming a black belt means that you so fully understand this maxim that your every step, breath, slight movement of the hand exudes judo or hop jitsu or nin jutsu or kung fu. To be a black belt is to make judo and you one, its not even knowing this or that technique, that will truly get you nowhere, it is being judo such that you know all the motivations, why you do ippon seionages or tomonages or ude garames when you do them: you know the one maxim that will predict all other moves in judo. My knew philosophies about judo and the martial arts have made them something i would really consider making a life out of because there is so much to be gleaned from them about....everything. Like there are the little cracker ass crackers in my class that are always questioning sensei, or telling sensei that he did something wrong. Holy crap nothing makes me more terse, sensei is a sensei because he knows what is best for me better than I do, if he tells me to do ten pushups and i dont even know what motivated it, it doesnt matter, sensei told me to do it. Sensei is the embodiment of judo. If he makes me practice techniques without water for hours and hours until my piss comes out like snot (The Usual Suspects RULES!) I will, because I have put my life and trust in sensei's hands because he deserves it. I kind of relate this to many of the islamic based religions what with their doctrines of the tranquility and contentment that comes from the total surrender to god. It's sad, I can't even call my senseis their actual names outside of the dojo, its impossible. Its interesting, every day that he is present in the class I spar with sensei cozzolinno and i can be breathing so hard and entirely unable to exert any real muscular force anymore and he will hardly have broken a sweat (Judo maxim number two:maximum efficiency, minimum effort). I've only ever pinned the bastard without his consent once. Judo embodies the two things I love about my existence: the examination of philosophies, natures, and motivations and getting to exert myself physically and become efficient with my movies, sanguine, naturally graceful. God damnit i love this stuff. A friend i only ever talked to once told me about a shin tao monk he knew that could jump up over a full grown man if he were attacked from behind......some day, some day.
So the point of this journal, in part, was just to talk about judo and this newfound well of thought ive delved into. But what lies therein is an important concept: looking to the nature of things for understanding. Too often do people see the causes, but not their effects. Its simply human culture or even human nature to see the ends but not the means, but in a society where cognition rules and is depended upon for evolution, we need to start continually asking ""why?"" or we will never truly understand anything and will remain in this societal cesspool we're in. Thinking about the culture I've been creating for mr uranich's class, which a select few will get to see presented tomorrow, I came up with something to say as a man of this culture to the rest of the class: from what we have seen of your culture we realize that you, too, are doomed to enlightenment.
Seiza......kiosuke.....rei. (phonetic, i dont know how they are actually spelled)

"event","So I just got off the phone with sarah. I was supposed to give her a massage today, i gave her one last night cause shes been really stressed out lately and I love sarah to death, I gave through understanding and the joy and ecstasy of giving, receiving, and sharing pleasure. Again, its so hard to be me, I alienate the entire world because I justify overstepping social thresholds and being who I really feel is me at my best because I never really get to because im too busy remembering that I live in a world with other people who dont live like I do. With knowledge comes responsibility, on some level everyone else gets to be who they are and its ok or dont get to be who they are and dont have the wisdom to realize it, and its all fine and dandy. Ive tasted fat and its hard going back, if you catch my drift.So anyways, she told jordan about how that was her plans after she got off work that night and he wasnt so cavalier on the idea. Like you can really every own any other person, like being covetous ever actually works or makes any happiness. Well, anyway, it looks like were not doing that tonite, but it gave rise to another one of my shots at social irrationale. Sexual repression has been hell for this society, it really has. Body fluids are seen as uncouth and dirty simply because they come from the genitalia and that area. Genitalia is seen as something to be secret and coveted mostly because early society evolved through strictly monotheistic western religions that just so happened to rise at the right time and with its doctrines of sexual repression and covetousness, what with marriage and the like which has entirely ruined interpersonal relationships between people. I say this because now there becomes a difference between people who have earned your love and people who havent, people who deserve to be given things from you and people who dont. These things arent just physical, whenever i talk about giving and taking it always means tangible and intangible, everything we deal with has something to do with economy. Marriage has done this because it set the precedence for there being people who are higher on your emotional hierarchy than others, thus pretty much entirely ruining spontanous altruism. The problem with about everything i talk about is that its always an undertone, these things happen because they are the very nature of the people, 2+2= 4 stuff, you guys have heard that shpiel, and that fact is also what makes it hugely important. I think im done talkin about this crap though, but hey, penny for your thoughts. Oh wait....i think i misinterpreted that phrase....shit.
Night everybody."

"event","This is the continuation of my animals thing, so here goes. I'd also like to start off saying that this is not going off as well as it did in my head, words really murder thoughts some times. So, this concept creates a very shallow relationship with people, i attain mostly acquaintances (many of them) but they stay alive only through my charisma and jokes and stuff like that, no substance. Even in some of my pub friends and such, the relationships are very skin deep and deal only with emotional and physical pleasure in the way of jokes and surface level talk. Like massage, people tell me im a fantastic masseuse and they're right and I've learned it through learning how to pleasure a person physically and spiritually, it is more of a biproduct. So anyways, the people around me who I dont hang out with after I do my pertinent daily activities (outside of school friends, in a sense) have these really surface level relationships with me and I think the way I interact with them makes some interesting assumptions about me. I feel like a non entity in other people's eyes and that became increasingly more apparent as I began to understand that others dont see me as a sexual being. This freely giving of the two kinds of pleasure has made kind of a taking for granted sort of thing, I dunno, to me it seems that since I share so much of myself with everyone else and give them so much in the ways of tangible and intangible pleasure that they begin to see me as almost like a shell, a human with no substance, what comes to mind is a personified vibrator in a sense. I think what it boils down to is that people are so comfortable with me talking to me and allowing me to touch them like in massage that I've been placed aside from the rest of the populous who they would regard with skepticism and fear, im someone they dont have to worry about so they forget their inhibitions so they forget themselves and become almost blank slates, aren't able to really invest because they've forgotten themselves as humans. This isnt as starkly observable, but I can feel the undertone, I suppose. Anyways, I feel I messed that all up, but this is how its going, the thought was good enough for me. Goodnight, everyone, sweet dreams."

"event","Last night was a wonderful night that had two very poignant moments: the culmination of a thought long in the making (then the losing of that thought) and then its phoenix like ascent rocketing into my mind once more with a pull of the hair (I love you kim!). Anyways, Ive discovered the very basal undertone of my relationship with nearly everyone in Port Angeles and it came from my childhood in a very interesting way. As a child I had instilled in me a good sense of philanthropy such that I was willing to bear the burden of anyone, the world, because I was living and able. This expressed itself in many ways, I loved cats very much, and in a very subtle sense it became a science for me to learn how to physically pleasure them in different ways by petting and the like, learning what they liked or what they didnt, how they changed over time and from cat to cat (like when some of them bite or lick the air when you scratch the notch of their tail and their ass, funny stuff). Well anyways, this transcribed over into dogs and being the undertone it was morphed my relationship with the world and its people. The giving and receiving of ecstasy in many different ways, emotional, physical, sexual (which is more an amalgam of the two)became a science and I loved doing that with people because it was a way to relate to them (though it does perpetuate a precedence of instant gratification and thats no good), and I grew to understand what was happening between the animals and myself and how our relationships changed or how they were always very similar (i'll touch on relationships more in depth in my next journal). Good lord its parenthases city...For some reason I dont feel I've beaten this dead horse enough yet, but its time I leave, I suppose I've got time, always time. Au revoir, mes amis, avez un bon jour."

"event","So a friend of mine, and the dad of a friend of mine, kenyon, he offered me a ticket to anywhere in the world with the stipulation that I stay abroad for a long time and travel, at least a year. So yeah< i really want to take it, in fact I'm positive I will and I planned to go at the beginning of spring break to France with nicole, go be a tourist for 2 weeks and then start actually living, probably just being nomadic and move from country to country around there. It's been feeling really daunting though, there is so much past and so much future here I dont want to leave behind, I'm still so in love with melanie and I dont want to leave those possibilities behind. I'll miss all the people I've thought about as I went to sleep, who I dreamed about, who I woke with a song of praise on my lips for, I love interacting with them all so much, even those familiar strangers in the cars zipping past, david uranich, angela, sarah, ryan, lisel, doug, alex, mandy, everyone, port angeles and its surrounding area. But most of all melanie. Though at the same time, if I stayed here I'd most assuredly end up killing myself, it fills me with much emptiness because I am a creature of growth and I have been stagnant for too long. What I really want to talk about now is melanie though, because however interesting a subject this is, its been a year and 5 days since she dumped me and she's still the only girl I can feel whole with....the only person I am and have ever been shamelessly in love with. Every day I come up with speeches and lines of verse about how asinine it is that we should deny something so natural(im sorry if you dont understand or think you understand and dont, this is mostly for me, and maybe melanie if she reads it....). There was nothing too personal, too gross, too sweet to share.....such was my devotion to her. And i know its reciprocated, in her own words and feelings, but reciprocated nonetheless and it tears me up inside as I watch her walk the halls......gah....im done.....no more of this today....I did very little today, played video games...i got up at like 1 oclock so there wasnt much time to be productive as there was only another 4 1/2 hours of daylight left, and me with no car and all......I guess all I ever do is think, so thats all I ever put here. GOod night, guys."

"event","Wouldn't be the first time. I get into such crazy headbutting debates with people, and we never really get anywhere with it, there is no conceding, there is no growth, and I'm not sure if that is my fault, their fault, or normal. I've come to realize lately that I don't have a grasp of social convention. Well, the fact that im aware of it kind of farts in the face of that last statement, but I don't have the common sense to differ between what is ""right"" and ""wrong"" socially, and it's really starting to bother me a lot. It has a lot to do with my last entry, I love my fellows so fantastically much but I feel that I alienate them by basically being me. THe very nature of myself is such. I remember when I was a kid going into the shower one day and it hit me that there were these things that everyone did but I did not because I didn't know any better, and I wished for a teacher or SOMEONE to make it clear to me. It evades me to this day, and some would say that is not a fault, but it's really hard being different all the time. People are so funny, I dont wear shoes and I get disgust and interest and indifference, and now when I do wear (after it's become something unexpected) I get the same: disgust, indifference, interest. I am constantly ostracized whether I am average or am not. I walk the line between melancholy and jovial, I am so much both. I mean look at this, everyone else talks about the basal parts of their day and all I can do is make some intellectual point out of all this shit as well as my last entries. Today was christmas, it was very nice, I got a bangin sleeping bag, a watch, a REALLY hard puzzle (its a 500 peice picture of a pile of popcorn) a hammock, and some other stuff. Christmas doesn't really mean much to me, mostly because I receive gifts. Now all I ever do on christmas is drink myself silly and sit around munching on snackfoods until dinner and more drinking and sleep. I guess like an average day, but with snackfood, and profuse drinking(its not so profuse except for christmas, its a christmas miracle!).
I don't know sometimes, it feels like a long rest would be easier than investing myself in life so much. I guess I shouldn't say that though, you guys might not understand.......good night everyone, sweet dreams."

Ever since I was a child I've been incredibly benign. Words that came to me just today: Eager to bear the burdens of others, share their greif. Until recently I've been finding it and exploring it, enjoying a new sense of objectivity. Anyways, what I really came here to write about was how perturbed I am at the fact that also a constant throughout my life has been distrust at my philanthropy. I'll start off by saying I'm not throwing out the possibility I could be an arrogant, nosy, naive....buttface. To have known my last entry, this will make sense: I am so entirely outraged at my lack of experience to make this empyrically valid, I only have little port angeles and the surrounding area. I digress. I feel that I am largely hindered in my caring for the entire world by the staunch cynicism of the average person. The average person a staunch cynic when it comes to what I'd say I feel is Jesus like altruism. And being kind and invested and unbashful about life is so distrusted, people are so afraid to put their trust in another's hands and its asinine. It starts primarily with sexual repression, thats where a lot of it comes from and because that has been such an ingrained portion of world culture in general. Love has a lot to do with being benign and also with being hurt and vulnerable. People often shy away from it for fear of rejection, emberassment. SO they shy away from my love, counter it with distrust and a hatred, almost, from their pit. It makes me sad, I wish people wouldn't be bashful with me, I have no shame, their emberassment, their fear, is entirely wasted on me. Its horrible, my very nature will be denied by all but the select few gracious enough to let me love them. lol....you all suck! ahh, c'est la vie, I suppose, but it sure does get frustrating when youre so pressed with time. I've only got, at most, another 60 some years. It just seems so ridiculous that some would refuse me trying and succeding at making their short time on this earth more rewarding before they get shuffled off of this mortal coil. Night everybody, sweet dreams."

"event","During my sophomore year of highschool, right about this time, I discovered unbridled happiness within myself. It came walking down the street east of the highschool, away from raymond's meloncholy(at the time) house. His family had come home from a movie very angry with something, and it came down on the unsuspecting Magic heads on the living room floor drinking juice which wasn't allowed in the living room. So I left that because I knew I would feel empty in bed that night if I kept all that around me. About two miles away was Alanna's house, and walking down all I could do is feel the most joyous regret....I knew I had hurt them to leave, and I was sorry, but I kept in mind that I was sorry because I loved them as people, and I couldn't stop smiling. That persisted for some time, a year and a half. Since then I feel like I've sponged a lot of the learning I can from this place, and however much I appreciate and care for everyone I see here it's been monotony for 18 years now that I've come to grok my life in Port Angeles in fullness (for the Heinleiners out there). A tree that ceases to grow will die. I know there are so many more people out there that I could be so invested in, learn so much more from, appreciate in an entirely different way. People are so dynamic, and there is so much contrast out there that will be lost if there is no carpe diemin' any time soon, I'll have lost it forever. ""In order to live free and happily, you must sacrifice boredom. It is not always an easy sacrifice""(Illusions by Richard Bach). At the same time, I'm leaving a place full of regret, joy, pain, love, care, deceit, kindness and thats so hard, leaving the rich past so many of us forget we own. Im not sure if this is a good place to end this or not, but here goes.
                                          Fin"

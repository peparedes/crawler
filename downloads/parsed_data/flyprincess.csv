"event","Beau and I had a lengthy conversation last night about us.
It was unexpected to talk about a relationship, if you could call it that for only about a month now. 
Woman's intuition kicked in this past weekend, when Beau didn't call me.
I didn't know exactly what was on his mind, but I knew he was deep in thought.  Beau is one of those rare guys you could have faith in and take home to meet the parents. A boyscott,  a family oriented, down with my friends type of guy. All american guy and I would add metrosexual.
It's good to know that he knows what he wants in a relationship.
He asked me how I felt about him. Before I could answer, he said I would like to be friends. I was thinking to myself, not to sound full of myself...but he's giving me the ""I only want to be friend's talk."" I can't believe he's giving me this speech. I should be the one giving it to him.
Well, in all honesty. I respected him for telling me how he felt and breaking it to me in a way that, I still liked him and myself at the end of the talk.
He said he really thought about why we shouldn't be together this weekend while he was up at tahoe. I wanted to give him some distance and not call him this weekend, because it seemed like he wanted to be alone w/ his friends.
He told me there are 3 things why he felt we shouldn't continue seeing each other.
1) The distance. He lives in SF and I live in the eastbay. He felt we have a long distant relationship and seeing me once a week is not enough for him. I was surprised to hear this from a guy. Usually it's the girl, who complains about the guy not spending enough time with her. 
2) The intagibles. We're both busy. We're both young professionals who work and go to school. Thus the time issue again.
3) More intangibles. Intimacy or lack there of.

He wanted me to be able to sleep over his place and be able to wake up with me the next morning. He wanted to be able to share everything with me.
Ironically, those are the things I want too, but at this point in time in my life. I'm unable to give it to him. He wants a serious relationship, and I can't say he's the guy for me right now. Maybe down the line, if our paths cross and things were different, then possibly, but not right now.

I was surprised that Beau was able to recall everything that we did together this past month. He said the sweetest thing. This month was all about you, all I could think about was you. I think talking about our walls, really brought out how protectected our walls are. My wall, you can't break it yet...some guy is going to have to go the extra mile and start climbing up the wall. With Beau's wall, I think some lucky girl will be able to break the barriers down. I told him he deserves everything he wants and I really wish I could give it to him.

It was awkward saying goodbye to him. He was even so sweet, to ask me, if I would sleep ok. I told him yes. 
The thing is, he was able to do something I wasn't able to do with many of my relationships. He was able to break it, before it started down the wrong course. I've thought about giving Beau the speech first, but I'm glad he did it, because he did it the right way. I feel like that's the closure, every relationship should have."

My dad was complaining to my mom how I might not cook the seafood thoroughly. I swear, seafood does not take that long to cook. My dad was bitching and whining. He was saying the smell of the onions were too potent and was giving him a headache.

After it was all cooked. I didn't hear a peep out of my dad.
I asked him how it tasted. He said ""good"". I shut him up

Even before I got on my first lift, I injured myself.
Right foot in the binding. Left food following the board.
All of a sudden, I felt a pang of pain in the groin area.
Right food moving board, left following again. Then Owwwwww owwwww... Damn it, I acidently pulled something.
And my day just started. I would have understood if it happened at the end of the day.

Freaken eh. Toward the end of the day. My groin hurts like hell. I couldn't even put on my left binding with out whining like a princess.

Did I get better? I think I managed not to fall too much.
I think the older I get, the less bolder I become. I just think too much, instead of just going for it. I'm tired of freaken falling, so I just snow plow my way down.
I'm pissed at myself for not getting the heel, toe thing down.

I should have gotten a season pass. Went up 4 times already.
Damn it.

I can feel my groin area stressed, but I will live to board another day."

This bruise seemed to be like 2 inches in diameter. When I saw how purple it was, it reminded me of the pain I went through, when I tripped over that mogul and fell on the hard icy ground. I wanted to cry all over again. : (

A friend of mine asked me to take a picture of it. I would consider it, if the bruise wasn't on my inner cheek. I'm contemplating whether or not I should go boarding this weekend. I don't want to add more bruises on the same spot. I'm not scared of pain, bring it on. 

I have matching bruises on my knees as well. I think those war bruises are kind of cool. 

I talked to Ro last night, told him about my bruise. He told me to put some tiger palm on it. Since he's a double diamond boarder, he said that one of these days I'll get sick of falling and won't fall anymore. I don't know what kind of advice that is, but I think I'm already sick of falling and it's just part of my learning curve."

This weekend was my 2nd time up at Tahoe this season.
I felt more confident this time.

I went to the blue runs. Pretty confident in myself, in my new helmet, speeding down the run, then *POW on my ass.
Let me tell you. The helmet saved my head, but I needed some butt pads to save my ass. I felt so much pain landing so hard on my tail bone. It was a lot of fun though.
Phil, this guy I met on speed dating babysat me half the time we were there. He was pretty patient with me. : )

I really needed to work on my heal, toe, heal toe. I still have not gotten that down. * : (

We had an awesome cabin on donner lake.
It fits 10 comfortably. HOT Tub and Jacuzzi, over looking the lake. We arrived at the Cabin, Friday night. There was a communication error, and 2 of owners of the cabin were there. 
They thought that we wanted to cancel our rsvp, but we had enough room for everyone.
That Friday night we had, 11 ppl at the cabin.
Saturday night we had 13 ppl. The cabin was super packed.
Luckily I was sleeping on a bed.

I couldn't get any sleep Friday night, because rob was snoring like no tomorrow. So, Saturday I was running on full adrenaline.

Saturday night, I went to sleep early. Thinking that we were going to board Sunday.
Danny, Winnie and a couple of others stayed up late drinking, so we didn't make it to the slopes. It was all good, to stay back and relax.

4 of Phil's friends stayed Sat night. From what I see is not to get involved with Phil, because him and his friend are pretty lazy. Made no effort to help out cleaning or cooking. 

AWESOME TRIP!"

I feel like a jerk, even though I didn't do anything wrong.
After telling him, my only intention is to be his friend. He was sad and kind of stopped talking to me. He blocked me on aim. It's sad loosing potential friends.

Went to Murrays, a hotel, turned club for a night. I was impressed w/ the turn out, especially with all my friends going. I had a lot of fun dancing with my friends.

I was a ballerina, my friend danny called me a slutty ballerina. I didn't take offense to it, because it was all in fun (I hope).

When we got to Murrays, it was sort of empty. So, we wanted to go to rouge. Good thing we didn't go to rouge, because we heard it was dead.

An hour or so later, tons of people in costumes started making their way into the hotel. I think my favorite costume was the night was Tigger. He was a pretty cute tigger. My other favorite costume was Totoro.

Of course I ran into Ro. He introduced me to one of his friends P, P seemed to take a liken to me. He was voluntarily telling that he knows all of Ro's weaknesses and will tell them all to me. I have no desire to control Ro. Ro didn't seem to want to leave my side the whole night. I think it could possibly be my costume or other guys were hitting on me while we were dancing.

A group of singles - an equal number of men and women -- gather together. The venue is filled with ""tables for two,"" and each table is numbered. You will have a set amount of time of 4 minutes per date.

The MC will announce the end of each date session and participants are asked to write on a form if they would be interested in seeing this person again. This entails simply checking a 'yes' or 'no' box. The men then get up from their seats and move to the next table, where another woman is waiting to meet them. If both sides checked off the 'yes' box, organizers let participants know within 48 hours which matches have been made, and give each side the other's email address.

____________________________________________________________________________________

My experience:

I signed up for this about a month ago. It was only $10, so I was like ok let me try it. My friends have tried it before and they had fun on their mini-dates. I was really hesitant. I needed my hand held, so I forced 2 of my friends to go with me. I wouldn't have done it, if I went alone.

We showed up early to watch the first session that began at 7 pm. The event was held at venture frogs restaurant. So, we ate while observing the first session.

My friend Vinh recognized that Jean, bev's sister was one of the girls in the first session. I knew I would run into a couple of people there. Jean was there w/ Hong. Hong is a funny girl. I also ran into Danny's friend, Phil. Phil is pretty cute, but he smokes. Ideally, Phil would be someone I would go out with, if he didn't smoke.

Session 2 started. I don't think I was nervous. I did feel like I was compensating for most of the guys lack of personality. 

One of the guys had pieces of shredded paper w/ questions on them. He asked me to pull a question out and then answer it. My question was: What movie ending would you change and how would you change it? I answered Titanic. I would have Jack live, so that there would be a happy ending, but I guess the movie wouldn't be as good if he lived. I thought he was original, but a very weird approach. He then proceeded to put his hands on his forehead and said I bet I know what type of music you like. I was very nice to this guy, because I felt bad for him. He pretended like he had esp or something, because he said you like Dave Matthews, I was like yeah. He continued to say you like Faith Hill and Sting. I was really uhh yeah. I mean, I don't normally listen to these people, but I like their music. So, I don't think I was lying.

There was this other guy, who I was just like is it over yet. I asked him why he was here, he said because he signed up for the event. Like uhh ok. I think he was trying to be humorous, but it backfired on him.

There were a couple of guys however, that made my experience fun. I however, don't remember their names. It's hard talking to 10 people and remembering who is who.

I got my results back from the event. I said yes to 5 people. 4 out of those 5 people said yes to me. I don't even remember who they are, even though it was just yesterday.

I have their contact info, and they have mine. I think i'm just going to wait until they contact me."

Throughout the dream. I remembered that I wanted to ask him ""Why?""
Just ""Why, Rob?"" 

I refrained from asking him too soon, because I didn't want to scare him away. I wanted to be with him for awhile. I forgot what it's like to be around Rob. I forgot that I did love him.

The class is set up for people who have never ridden before. A couple of people in the class: have their permit or own a bike or ridden already. I have ridden bitch back, and that's about it. 

I learned where the clutch, throttle, stand, brakes and other parts of the bike were located. The instructor told me I had problems controlling my clutch and that I can't continue with the course. I was like ok. He said for me to learn how to balance by learning how to ride a bicycle first and that I should re-register later. Man this guy is an ass. I replied, I already know how to ride a bike. 

I didn't know what to say to him. I said ok and left. I was half pissed, because the point of the class is to teach newbies like myself how to ride. How am I suppose to learn how to control anything, if I don't get taught. I left the class determined to come back next time and pass the class. I talked to a couple of my friends, who put in their 2 cents. A couple of them, said for me to purchase a bike and learn how to ride then go back to the class. Another one said, for me to get my permit first, so I could legally ride. I felt really really bad that I got kicked out. 

I think I would be able to learn better, if I was taught on an individual basis. I've got to say even though I was riding in a straight line, it was nice to be doing it. 

Part of me wants to prove the F* instructor wrong and just do whatever it takes to get my license. The other part of me finds it intimidating and therefore hesitant to continue. Maybe I should just sell my helmet, and get my money back from lessons and buy a golf set and take golf lessons instead?"

We met at Starbucks to talk. There were way too many people around. We decided to go to the San Leandro Marina instead. He's too funny. He said you must really want to chew me out, is that why you want less people around? I laughed. 

I told him why I was mad at him. He brought up that from our previous talks he wasn't ready for a relationship. I told him that maybe he's not the one I want a relationship with. I told him Richard. In a relationship, I want to be able to go on vacation with my significant other. I want to wake up and see the sunrise with him and I want to watch the sunset together. I want to lie there in his arms and feel like I belong with him. 

I asked him, how would you feel if I went on vacation with someone else? He said he wouldn't like that. I said what am I suppose to do? I asked him if he would go on vacation with me? He said if I asked him to, he would. 

He said he can't give me what I want, in terms of a relationship. He went on to say that I deserve better. I told him, I agree.

We decided to take a break for 4 weeks and see how it goes. I think it's an indefinite break. With Richard, I didn't have a whole lot of my feelings invested and I feel like I can break away w/o any animosity toward him. I genuinely could be his friend. 

I think I became a better person from knowing him."

"event","After my work out shower at the gym yesterday, I had this bad feeling like somthing bad was going to happen. I tried to shake the feeling, but I couldn't.

I went back to my car and saw that I had a missed call. It was Kumi, an ex bf. 

Kumi and I are on really good terms. We still keep in touch and have no hard feelings.

I called Kumi back and asked him what's up, are you bored? He said you think I call you when I'm bored, in a joking tone. I said uh huh. 

He had some bad news for me. His great grandmother passed away Weds morning. She was 103 yrs old I think. She couldn't breathe on her own and was connected to a machine. His family decided to pull the plug. She was breathing on her own, but not for long.

I really wanted to cry when I heard this. He told me that it was her time and they were prepared to let her go. He told me, service will be held Saturday and Sunday. I didn't know if that was an invitation to go. I didn't think about asking him, if I should go or not, until after we hung up. I don't think I would be going.

I wasn't that close to his family, but I did adore the fact how his family got along so well.

I was on the way to my friend's bday dinner in Cambell at Buca's. On the way there, I couldn't help thinking about my grandparents in WA. I was thinking about what if lost them? I see them once a year, just to see how they are doing. My grandparents talk to me, but I don't really listen. I feel like booking a flight and just going to see how they are doing. I need to see them."

The HR lady explained to me that the person who got the job, left the company about a year ago and decided to come back and do something similar to her previous position. She was more qualified. I admit, I am bummed out. On the other hand, if it wasn't meant to be, it wasn't meant to be. I did however get positive feedback from her. She said I did really well on my interviews and encouraged me to keep trying for other regulatory positions.
I'm still waiting to hear from another position in Medical Affair. Hopefully, I'll be getting good news from them soon. If not, then I'm going on vacation. I do have 160 hrs of vacation to take advantage of."

"event","A friend finally convinced me that I should have that talk w/ Ro. So, I did.
I returned Ro's call yesterday around 10 pm. and asked him you know that movie ""good will hunting"" when Minnie Driver goes up to Matt Damon and asked him if he's an idiot? He said yes. Well, that's what i'm asking you. Are you an idiot? He answered, ""Yes."" He didn't even ask me, why i was asking him if he was an idiot. He said he's an idiot sometimes, because of the bad choices he makes. I asked, are you an idiot when it comes to women? He said yes. I asked him, what is your problem? You have a decent looking chick, and despite her blonde moments, she's pretty smart. He was stupid enough to ask me, were you referring to yourself? I said, yes.
He said he's not ready for a committment, and I said I'm not asking you for one..I just want to know where this is going. I feel like when I am talking to you, it's like pulling teeth.  I asked him, have I pressured you to feel like you need to be my bf..he said no, but he feels like that's the natural step of progression is to go from dating to bf/gf. Basically he's stressing himself out for nothing. I said I'm use to getting attention and treated like a princess. hehe... I actually said that. He said he's afraid of getting hurt, and he feels like he's not psychologically ready or may never to be ready to fully give his attention to me or anyone.  I said I don't even know what I want from you, because I feel like I don't know you, and to ask if I want you as my bf, I can't say I do..but at least give me that opportunity to find out whether I want there to be something more between us. 
In the end he said, Celeste, you know more about me than most people I've known since HS. I like talking to you and I want you to still be in my life, but the ball is in your court.
I said, then lets be friends. I can't continue to have an open relationship with you knowing that you can't give me what I need or want. It's not fair to you or me. 
I told him, my door will always be open to you as a friend, and if you decide you're willing to give me more down the line, my door may or may not be open to that. 
I was surprised by his sad tone. I told him, I feel sadder than him. He said we'll talk again tomorrow. I don't know what else we could possibly talk about. 

I honestly don't know if we could be friends, maybe down the line, but could we possibly be friends right now?
It was definitely a good thing, that I got to know him. He's a good guy. Hopefully someday he'll find that girl, that could change his heart."

"event","I think Don Picos went quite well. I hope everyone enjoyed the food as much as I did. Most of my friends finally met Ro. I don't know what they think of him yet. He didn't say much to my friends. During dinner, laura got buzzed off of a couple of water down margaritas. I think the drinks were an excuse to be obnoxiously loud. At the end of dinner she made a speech. She thanked me for putting the dinner together for her and she almost made me cry. She said she's glad to have friends who stick by her, no matter how bad her decisions are. I feel bad for that girl, but her decisions are hers alone. 

I did end up caking laura in the face. I didn't do it too badly, because we went clubbing after wards.

Clubbing. Man I think I shall not bring a date clubbing anymore. DUH! There were so many cute guys at rouge. I bumped into a lot of people from work. Laura and Irene were hitting on my co-worker Chris K. haha...it was halarious to see them obviously flirting w/ him. 

I bumped into Kevin there w/ 2 of his friends from Korea. I spoke to Kevin on Sunday, he said he saw Ro and I holding hands and asked if were going out. I said Ro was just a friend and we were holding hands, so we wouldn't get lost in the crowd. I think Kevin believed me. 

Overall, Rouge was a success. I'm glad everyone had a good time or I hope they did at least."

"event","it's exhausting planning other people's parties. I've been planning Laura's bday for the past couple of days and it's not an easy thing, especially with 15 or more people. I kept pestering Laura on giving me a head count, so I could pick a restaurant that will accommodate the group. Laura gave me a list of people to call for her. Calling friends of friends is a bad idea. I call this people introducing myself as Laura's friend and then asking them if they want to go to her bday party on friday. They're still like who is this again? What do you want? Then finally when I get a ""Yes"", out of them. It's like where are we going at what time? I have to explain to them it's probably in the peninsula or the northbay, i'm tryin to get a head count first so I know how many people to make reservations for. blah blah blah. 

After finally getting a head count. I have to pick a restaurant. After narrowing down my choices, I call these restaurants, to only find out that they don't accommodate large groups or they don't have reservations available at 8pm.

I remembered that I ate at Don Picos in San Bruno and it was fantastic. I hit the jackpot, because they had reservations at 8pm and were able to accommodate my people.

So, one thing out of the way. Now, to pick out a gift for her. Laura wants one of the 3 things. 1)Ladder, cuz she's short 2)Set of Henckels knives 3)Bangle Bracelet.

Irene and I decided to chip in and get her a set of knives. I didn't know how much knives run for. Did some research and found out that Henckles are one of the top brands. I should have known anything from Germany, must cost bucks. Saw a set of 7 knives online at Macys for around $100. Irene went to Macys and they didn't have them. I called for Macys today and none of them had them in stock. Irene found out that the Macy's Warehouse don't have any in stock. They should be getting them in at the end of October. So Laura would get her gift around November. I searched and searched online for possible stores that would sell Henckel knives for a good price. Turns out these knives are just insanely expensive everywhere.

I didn't want Laura to get a late bday present. In the end, I'm too exhausted to look anymore. She'll have to live w/ what we get her.

HAPPY 25TH BDAY LAURA. YOU'RE LIKE A SISTER TO ME."

Went out w/ Ed. Saw his Loft in SF. Nice loft. We went to dinner at  texas road house in Union City. We spontaneously went to the A's game and bought tickets from a scalper. It was freezing cold. Het had on a short sleeve shirt and I had a  thin jacket. We left the game during the 7th inning stretch. We went chatted awhile at Starbucks. Ed seems like a nice guy. I couldn't help thinking that he's short. Is it vain of me, not to like him because of his height?

Saturday: 

Went to Irene's sister, Julie's surprise bbq. 
Had dinner w/ Hugo and Bev. Went clubbing at DNA lounge  w/ Vinh, Yance, Jeff and Tom. Met up w/ Bob and his gf Aileen and her sisters and cousins. Drama.
Bob was yelling at Aileen because she was freaking other guys. Total double standard, because he Bob was freaking me. So there was a shouting match on stage. I could see tears on Aileen's face. Bob told me it was over. I think Bob loves Aileen too much, for it to be over.
I didn't have that much of a good time. Clubbing for me is something to do to pass the time.

Sunday:

Went to Oakley for Jacob's bday and his brother's house warming. Oakley? Where the hell is that? It's north of Antioch. I had a good time. Mingling with older people, makes me feel cool. Maybe it's because I could learn so much from them. I had too much dessert wine. I was totally pink when I left the party. I love lambrusco, dessert wine. I didn't think I would like it, but man I think I found a winner. I usually don't drink, but I think I drank a cup of it. I went to Laura's house, and just crashed on the couch.  Alcohol makes me sleepy. 
I was suppose to go clubbing w/ Vinh and some other friends that night at Cityscape but decided to chill w/ Ro. 

Monday:

Ro and I went rollerblading along Embarcadero in the City. It was such a nice day. I'm glad I didn't waste it away, studying for my Real Estate class *hehe. We ate at a deli located in Pier 1. then rollerbladed towards Pier 39, then rollerbladed back  towards Pac Bell park. 
We had a great time in the city. I'm glad neither of us fell.
We went back to his place, and just vegged out in front of the TV.
It was nice relaxing and not doing anything. I feel comfortable with him."

I could tell he's really buff, even though he was wearing a collared shirt. Kev told me on Monday, not to be surprised if Ed called me. I thought Kev was joking. I got a good surprise Monday night. Ed called me, but I was with Ro. I was studying for my Real Estate class, while Ro studied for his Broker's exam. I talked to Ed for about 15 secs, then I had to cut him off, because of you know who was right there. 

I got a missed call from Ed last night. I left my phone in my car, while Vinh, Yance and I went up to the Berkeley Observatory to try and look at Mars. It took us awhile to find Cambell Hall. When we got up on the roof, we couldn't see Mars, because all the clouds were blocking our view. We stayed there for about 30 mins, and then left. Maybe we'll get a chance to see Mars in the next couple of days, if not then maybe in the next 60 thousand years. 

I called Ed back on the way home. Ed asked if I was busy this weekend. I said I could make time for him. So, Ed and I have a date for friday night.

It seemed not to bother him, that I was standing by myself, or else he would have came up and grabbed my hand or asked me to dance or something.

Rowling tried to make it suspenseful, but in turn she just made it boring. I got tired of reading filler pages. I only found a couple of chapters to actually be exciting. I thought I would have enjoyed this book better if it was shorter. 
After Sirius was murdered by his cousin Bellatrix. I didn't feel sad at all. I thought it came out of left field somewhere. There wasn't enough detail setting up his murder. It was like he got pushed behind the arches and he disappeared. 
The final chapters of book 5, it didn't make me yearn for another sequal. It just made me bored. Of course I will end up reading book 6 and 7, out of curiousity."

"event","I went skydiving w/ my friends this past Saturday. It was located in Lodi, near Sac. We arrived there around 10 am. Didn't get to jump until 12:30. The couple of hours of waiting, calmed our nerves, until we got on the plane and were elevated at 13,000 feet. My heart started to beat so fast. The tadem master, said for me to get on his lap, so he could strap me in. I looked down through the window and all I could see was brown squares. I started to scream as we headed for the airplane door. Then all of a sudden my scream faded, when my tandem master pushed us through the doorway into the open air. I had my eyes closed for a couple of secs. I couldn't see us going revolving in in mid-air. I opened my eyes and I was eye to eye w/ my camera man. I just kept smiling at him. Then I begain to feel more comfortable as I stayed in the air. I sort of know how birds feel now. Free falling was so amazing. It felt like nothing, I have ever done before. When the parachute finally opened, we sort of just chilled there. The weightlessness, the awesome view of the city, the high, was everything I imagined it to be. I thought I would be more scared though, but I just relaxed and let my body fall.
My only complaint, was ears really hurted because of the altitude. It was worse than being in the airplane feeling. As we got closer to the ground, the pressure my ears felt, started to subside. I thanks my tandem master after a safe landing. If I had to describe skydiving in one word, it would be ""ORGASMIC."" I WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.

"event","My first AIDS walk experience. Taking the bus to Golden Gate park, then actually walking to my company's both seemed like a journey. My friends and I got to the park around 9ish. Ate breakfast. We were really excited for the walk to start, actually to finish the walk. We ate some breakfast, did some warm ups. Then finally the walk begain around 10:35. A mass of people just begin walking and you better walk fast, or those people will trample on you. It was good to see, everyone was out there for a good cause. Losing one Sunday of sleep to help out people with AIDS, is totally worth it. When I hear my friends tell me it's too early to do the walk. It just doesn't seem like a good enough excuse. 

A couple of things that I found helped the walkers:

1) All the volunteers on the sideline, cheering us onward
2) The refreshments and drinks
3) The entertainers
4) Local celebrities giving their speeches
5) Positive attitudes
6) Company sponsors
7) Knowing that they are doing it for a good cause

I walked and walked and walked and walked, and I felt like I couldn't control my legs. They were just walking with out thinking. It felt good to complete the walk. It's was quite an experience. I look forward on doing this again next year."

"event","I need vacation ideas. I feel like escaping. I have this pounding headache. Work is making my hair turn grey. I feel like sobbing everyday behing my computer. I just remind myself, that it's not going to be like this forever. 

Vacation: Where should I go? I'm thinking somewhere warm, where I can relax and get a tan. 

I think I know the perfect cure. I'm going to start Judo again in the fall. I have a lot of frustration to vent out."

"event","Sean and I had a brief conversation yesterday. He told me I'm a nice girl, and any guy would be lucky to have me as a gf. He said he feels lucky to be in my presence. I see where this talk was heading. He said he's a bad boy on the outside and a bad boy on the inside, but he still has a heart. If I got into a relationship with him, I wouldn't know what I would be getting myself into. Basically, it's up to me or not whether I want this. He wants me to think really hard about whether or not my feelings are true. My feelings? I admit that my feelings could be a little distorted. It could be the lifestyle that he's living that excites me and I may not feel anything for him at all. 

I talked to Elmo yesterday. I told him I want to help him find a gf. Basically, it's my biggest hint, that I'm not interested in him. Basically, he discovered or I hinted to him that I have a crush on Sean. I think it's better that he knows. I didn't want to lead him on."

Tonight at around 7 pm central time I will be presenting my groups final presentation for my Master's program. I&nbsp;have to adopt a budhhist philosophy to the approaching time or I&nbsp;will freaking loose it.&nbsp;

Today's mantra is &quot;You are prepared, and you know what you are doing. Do not worry about anything it will get done.&quot; 

I say this to myself every time I&nbsp;want to run for the bathroom and throw up.&nbsp;

Technically I could possibly totally bomb my presentation tonight and still graduate. We are allowed one C in our courses and I have not burned that yet. But it is group work and I feel that if I do not do my best then the rest of my group will suffer. I can take the ding for my actions but I do not like other people taking the ding for me as well.

Debating on whether I am going to do one six page paper or two three page papers. It will depend on how difficult the six page paper is to write. Currently I am two pages in and still have a lot more to say."

Have some new people following and thought I would do a rehash for what is going on in my life.<br /><br />As of Wednesday, April 15th (yeah tax day) I have been officially accepted into the MBA&nbsp;program at William Woods. I&nbsp;will graduate in December of 2010. And for the family that is reading this&nbsp;I will be walking this time. I&nbsp;also had a joke with my mother on Friday about this. After I graduate, keep in mind I was the last one in my family to get their bachelors degree, my oldest brother will be the least degree'ed in the family. Which is just going to be great. I&nbsp;love it. Might have something to do with the fact that he constantly gives me the feeling that he thinks I am looser.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have also decided that in this time I will become fluent in Spanish, German, and Japanese. I think it will be good for business and dealing with a global economy. I&nbsp;am pretty sure about the Spanish and the German. Not to sure about the Japanese. I tried it once in school and I was just not that entertained by it. I am kind of fascinated in learning Hebrew. But that would be for pure fun at its best. <br /><br />I&nbsp;have listed a goal for my job title. It will be Director of a museum. Still working with people and history but doing it to preserve it for future generations. I&nbsp;am also loving the ethics part of my classes. I love me some ethics. Is it wrong that I tend to get an adrenaline rush when I even think about it? So who knows where I will end up.<br /></span></span><br />"

I understand that.<br /><br />People need to stop acting so god damned crazy. Yes it is bad. Yes things are tight for EVERYONE. But I am sorry if you did not earn the money by working then you do not deserve the money that is worth the job that you did not do. If you work a minimum wage job at McDonalds guess what you are entitled to the fucking money that your minimum wage job allows you. If you want more money get a better paying job (if you can find one) or improve your situation so you can. Do not come knocking to the doors of the people who bust their fucking asses to earn money for their families and do well at it.&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;DESERVE&nbsp;THEIR&nbsp;MONEY. Sorry we do not live in a socialistic or communist state. If you feel that we should take from the haves and give to the have nots. THEN&nbsp;FUCKING&nbsp;MOVE&nbsp;OUT&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COUNTRY. YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE MONEY SOMEONE GETS FOR BUSTING THEIR ASS FOR 80+HOURS A WEEK WHEN YOU DECIDE TO WORK A PART-TIME JOB. That is not what America was founded on. YOUR FUCKING ATTITUDE IS KILLING THIS COUNTRY. GET OFF YOUR GODDAMN ASS AND GET OUT THERE AND PROVIDE FOR THE LIFESTYLE THAT YOU WANT NOT THE LIFESTYLE THAT YOU FEEL THAT YOU DESERVE BUT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORK FOR BECAUSE OTHERS MAKE MORE THAN YOU. It is call drive people. Get it. Then you can be a part of the haves and get out of the catagory of the have nots. And please do not come down on me, I understand that most of the people that are in the have not catagory are not their by choice. BUT&nbsp;IT IS THE FUCKERS THAT SIT AND MILK THE SYSTEM THAT FUCK IT UP FOR EVERYONE. YES I AM TALKING YOU MOTHER OF 8 THAT COLLECT WELLFARE AND ALL YOUR BABBIES HAVE DIFFERENT DADDIES. YES I AM TALKING TO YOU, THE BUM SITTING ON THE COUCH BECAUSE YOU LIKE SITTING HOME AND DRINKING BEER INSTEAD OF WORKING. NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE INJURED OR HAVE A DISEASE BUT BECAUSE YOU FEEL THAT THE GOVERNEMENT OWES YOU SOMETHING. FUCKING WAKE UP. <br /><br />I do not owe you anything. You do not deserve any of my money. Own your shit and take responsibility for your situation if it is one that could have been avoided. I am tired of listening, reading, and hearing about how hard it is. You are not the only one in that boat. The entire country is in it. But there are still people who get up every day, get dressed, and go to work not knowing if they are going to have a job the next day. But you now what they bust their ass for that day so they can truly claim that it was nothing that they did that caused them to loose their job. Can you say the same? If you can you are not part of the problem. If you cannot guess what you are the problem. <br /><br />Someone recently told me &quot;People who own their mistakes become successful in life, those who do not do not succeed.&quot; In all honesty that is the truth.<br /><br />Stop looking for a handout or for the wealth to be spread between the classes. Because you are not owning your choices as your mistakes. Yours alone. You chose them. No one else did. Own them and then rise above them.</span></span></lj-cut>"

I sometimes get to the point that I just sit down and cry because it is just not happening fast enough. I will be honest most of the times I only come to the table with 50 - 70 % of what I really need to bring to the table.<br /><br />I am not at the point that I would even consider surgery. I can get around with out problems. Hell I have started running. Granted it is not very far but I am running for the first time in years. So to me&nbsp; surgery is not an option.<br /><br />So I am starting to re-evaluate my priorities when it comes to my weight loss. <br /><br />I have been eating 1800 - 1900 calories a day. Well it is obviously not enough. I am supposed to be eating between 3200 - 3400 calories a day. A great big difference. And I just do not know if I can do it. I mean I could do it if I was eating crap all the time, it would be easy. But to eat healthy and to eat that much is constantly eating almost every hour. I fucking hate feeling like I am constantly eating. <br /><br />Part of it is it is just a chore. It becomes a pain in my ass to eat all the time. Having to set aside time to eat when I would rather be doing other things. The other part is that I do not feel at times that I have the right to eat because I am so over weight. I feel that if I just stopped eating that I would loose weight in leaps and bounds. Well anyone who has tried to loose weight knows that this is bullshit and not the way to go about doing it. <br /><br />So I am sitting here now trying to decide if I can make a commitment to bring 100% of me to the table. <br /><br />To learn to suck it up and deal with everything. <br />To learn to put aside my feeling that I should not eat and realize that I need to eat (and apparently a lot) to loose weight. <br />To learn that people accept me for what is on the inside and not what is on the outside. <br />To learn that people do love me.<br />To learn to ask for help when I need it.<br />To learn that it is okay to cry when I need to cry.<br />To learn that I do not have to be the strong one.<br />To learn that I can TRUST people and they will not fuck me over.<br />To learn to TRUST ME.<br /><br />I want to say yes that I can do it. That I can do all that I need to do to get my ass in gear and do what needs to be done. But on the other hand I am so fucking scared. I would have to leave my perfect (to me) bubble and venture into many other different bubbles, or better yet not have a bubble at all. <br /><br />And to top this all off I just found out that my father is giving the commencement speech at my school this year for graduation. I am so not ready for my parents to be in my space. I am not there yet. I moved to where I moved because it was far enough away from them for me to lead my own life. And it was great for the first 9 years that I lived here. Then I decided to go back to school and for some reason my mom feels that since I am going there she needs to give back to the school that she graduated from. Yes I know most of this is my fault for going to the school my mother graduated from. I just want my life to be mine not theirs. GAH!!!</font></font>"

Yes I like to think things out way in advance. It helps me keep my focus on the goal. So yes I want to teach, but I have no idea where I want to teach. So I am going to substitute teach for a year or two until I find a school/class that I want to teach at. Hopefully by then there might be an opening for me to teach on a regular basis. But then again if not I can substitute until there is one.<br /><br />Faire is right around the corner. Garb is done. I have everything that I need and have to worry about nothing else.

It is for my psychology class and no names will be used. All answers will be screened.<br /><br />Answers to the questions are either true or false.<br /><br />1. A woman who goes to the home or apartment of a man on their first date implies that she is willing to have sex.<br /><br />2. Any female can get raped.<br /><br />3. One reason that women falsely report a rape is that they frequently have a need to call attention to themselves.<br /><br />4. Any healthy woman can successfully resist a rapist if she really wants to.<br /><br />5. When women go around braless or wearing short skirts and tight tops, they are just asking for trouble.<br /><br />6. In the majority of rapes, the victim is promiscuous or has a bad reputation.<br /><br />7. If a girl engages in necking or petting and she lets things get out of hand, it is her own fault if her partner forces sex on her.<br /><br />8. Women who get raped while hitchhiking get what they deserve.<br /><br />9. A woman who is stuck-up and thinks she is too good to talk to guys on the street deserves to be taught a lesson.<br /><br />10. Many women have an unconscious wish to be raped, and may then unconsciously set up a situation in which they are likely to be attacked.<br /><br />11. If a woman gets drunk at a party and has intercourse with a man she's just met there, she should be considered ""fair game"" to other males at the party who want to have sex with her too, whether she wants to or not.<br /><br />12. Many women who report a rape are lying because they are angry and want to get back at the man they accuse.<br /><br />13.&nbsp; Many, if not most, rapes are merely invented by women who discovered they were pregnant and wanted to protect their reputation.<br /><br /></font></div>"

I needed to go to my friends K &amp; M's to discuss some things for our booth at fair and finish some paperwork. I was pretty impressed with my growing knowledge of St. Louis as I made it to their home in just about an hour at 5 pm driving from the St. Charles area to downtown.

I totally forgot about it being St. Pat's day and traffic was kind of a horror going into the city until I got past Forrest Park. Then it was gone. Had a wonderful visit got some things taken care of. I hope to have the final paper work in for the booth this week so we can start construction soon. <br/><br/>Saturday afternoon - found me heading back home for an anti-St. Pat's party. But first I needed some retail therapy. I stopped at a DSW (designer shoe wherehouse) and went into sensory overload with all the beautiful shoes. I only walked out with two pairs but they are pretty. Got to the party two hours late but it really had just started LOL. Stayed a couple of hours and would have stayed longer but I realized that I had the ac on in the house because when I left it was hot out. So I kind of left in a hurry and the house was at 53 degrees when I got home. <br/><br/>I am now warm and snug in my house. I need to get out of bed and do some laundry. <br/><br/>I hopefully will have some good news or not so good news depending how you want to view it on Thursday. I will try to remember to post all about that when the time comes.  </span></font>"

"event","Well I think I have decided to spend at least part of my spring break in St. Louis this year. Yes much like last year. 

At first I was not sure if this was what I wanted too do as I could not think of what I wanted to do for the better part of a week. Then as I was driving to some of my friends house today I drove down through Forrest Park. And the light bulb went off. Everything at Forrest Park is free and I have been bemoaning the lack of culturally stimulating things to do in Columbia. So Forrest Park it is.

Now I just need to decide where to get my hotel room which will be centrally located to all the places that I like to go too. I think somewhere on 270 would be a great idea but I hate the hotels at the Paige exit as it is just such a pain in the as to get on and off the Highway.

I am still deciding what days I will be there. It will either be Tuesday - Saturday or Wednesday - Sunday. Or if I get a crazy notion it will be Tuesday - Sunday.

If anyone would like to join me for shopping, dinner, sight seeing or just general tomfoolery let me know and I will be more than happy to spend time with you. LOL"

Our gift limit is $100.00. I actually went over that. Well one of the pieces she evidentially decided to return to the company with a note to exchange it for something else. No biggie. She even included on the note her credit card number. I even received an email from said company regarding the exchange and emailed them stating that I did not order anything new. I was told do not worry about it there was an exchange and all was good. Not your credit card is going to be charged an additional $50.00.<br /><br />Okay now to today. Since I am snowed in I have been paying bills, looking at credit card statements to double check charges. And there is a charge from this company. I call them and say what is going on, why was I charged, yadda yadda yadda. Well I was told there was an exchange and since we had your credit card on file we charged it and we vaguely remember the note and there was a credit card number on it. I said well not this one. Well we keep credit card numbers on file, what do you want us to do about it? And this is where if there was the technology for pulling someone thru a phone it would have happened. <br /><br />I was flabbergasted of course that 1) they kept my credit card on file, i told them to remove it 2) that they would authorize an exchange and let someone else add things to my credit card, yeah I am lucky my sister-in-law is nice she could have maxed out my credit card 3) the attitude this is not our fault even though you contacted us when you received our email asking what was going on and we told you not to worry about it, not that we were going to charge your credit card $50.00.<br /><br />So now I have to contact my sister-in-law and find out what is going on. I know she gave them her credit card number and it was just easier to charge mine. But now I have to double check with her to make sure we both did not get charged.<br /><br />I guess this will work out for the best as I owe her $70.00. So now as I see it I owe her $20.00. <br /><br />I am not even remotely mad at her. I am mad at the company for being non-caring customer service retards.</font></font>"

This is an adult sci-fi convention in St. Louis put on a great bunch of people. My main reason for coming up this weekend was to buy corsets, but as you know from previous posts I have lost the ability to buy clothes that fit. Well I took home this http://www.curiouscatclothing.com/leathercorsets/lindex.html. This was my first foray into corset wearing. And I will say I loved it. I also wore it for 5 1/2 hours for my first time. Which I think is pretty awesome. I need to get myself up to consecutive 8 hour days and I will be golden for faire.<br /><br />What was even better was the looks that I received when wearing it. Let's just say that my ego might need another car to go home in. <br /><br />Yes I know I am pretty and I have heard it from many people this weekend, But I am just starting to really see it. <br /><br />I also purchased this as well http://www.curiouscatclothing.com/leathercorsets/lindex.html so I have two new lovelies.<br /><br />I meet many ljers this weekend <div class=""ljuser""><font><a href=""http://ohari.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom;"" alt=""[info]"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://ohari.livejournal.com/""><b>ohari</b></a></font></div>&nbsp;and his lovely ladies being the ones that I talked to the most. It was lovely meeting you guys. We will need to get together and talk yarn some time.<br /><br />Another mile stone past this weekend was that I wore heels (and not chunky boots) for the first time in about 10 years. They were so pretty and once again (as seems to be the theme for this entry) practice will enable me to wear them longer. I did fine on the carpet but hard services were a little bit harder.<br /><br />Well I am still at the hotel. I really need to get some homework done. Laters.</font>"

     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      You are a KINKY, CONFIDENT, DOMINANT lover who prefers to give.

This means that:

You like relatively kinky sex, and you have the great imagination that will always keep your partner guessing and excited! There's no getting bored with you around, you could never settle for dull sex, you want something fun and new all the time. You aren't afraid to try out anything you hear about. You might just be an intelligent lover who needs to be mentally engaged, or perhaps you have some dirty dark secret kinky desires, but either way, you're never boring. 

You are pretty confident in bed. This means that you know you can please your lover. Maybe you've read a lot of sex manuals, or have the experience from previous lovers, or just tend to be skilled at whatever you get your hands on, but you're good and you know it. You can really get results and know that you have pure talent, so you won't be hiding away shy, pretending to be all innocent. Your partners love your naughty self assurance, you don't hesitate and this makes you a sensational lover.

You tend to be dominant in bed, so you prefer to be the one giving the orders than taking them. Maybe you like the power, or just like controlling the pace, perhaps your partner likes to be dominanted, or maybe you get a kick out of the whole master/slave relationship, it could be something as small as liking to be on top during sex and tie up your lover to tease them, or it could be as kinky as them having to ask your permission to do anything at all. Either way, you are firm and you enjoy it! 

You prefer to give than recieve. This makes you a very unselfish lover, devoted to the needs of your partner rather than your own. You get your pleasure from seeing them get theirs, you are a model sex partner. I'm sure plenty of people would love to have someone like you in bed with them! Remember though that if your partner gets pleasure from returning the favour it's okay to let them, they might love giving as much as you do! 

WE SUGGEST YOU:
get into some slightly more hardcore fantasy territory. Go for bondage in a not so light and fluffy way and discover just what you really like. Want to play master/slave games? Want to be tied up or tie someone up, in just enough discomfort that they don't quite relax? Want to try a threesome? Maybe you'd even like to try out sado-masochism. It's your call. Whatever you do, unleash that kinky thing you've always really wanted to try and give it a go, you're a great lover, and you know it, up for anything, generous, imaginative, confident, and happy to go for what you want, so enjoy.

"event","Well the power just came back on here. Luckily I had the foresight to crank up the heater as I was anticipating loosing power at sometime.&nbsp; So it did not get too cold in the house but it was getting there.

I have learned that I do not like sleeping in complete silence. I usually do not do it. There is a fan and a radio going at all times while I am home. I also learned that without the fan going my internal body temp is to high for me to be comfortable sleeping.

So the fan and the radio are going. I am heading back to bed.

School is canceled today because of the conditions of the parking lots and walkways on campus. So I get to sleep in. I canceled workouts as I am sure I could get there but getting home gets me home after dark when everything turns to ice again. The joys of living on an unpaved road out in the country."

&nbsp;
I buy faire garb.

6 stilletto daggers purchased (all very pretty)
leather purchased to make sheaths for said daggers
4 chemise purchased
1 bodice bid on
Inquired on skirts

Yes if I keep on getting iced in I will not have to worry about garb for a long time. LOL"

Anyone have any ideas where a good place to go by yourself to relax is?"

"event","<font color=""#800080""><font size=""3"">The new semester starts tomorrow. My possible last year at schools starts this semester. Holy frick I am a senior. Honestly 5 years ago I would have said that this would never have happened. Man do things change.<br /><br />Have been thinking lately. And I am sure I will flip flop on this until it happens. I want to move to St. Louis, I want to get out of small town middle America. I can get a job. I can apply to another college to get my second degree in Education. Or I can stay at the school I am in now and complete my Education degree. Upside to do this is that I do not have to get accepted to the program I am already in it. Downside cannot work as all education classes are during the day. <br /><br />Again St. Louis is still winning as I can go to school at night and work during the day. That and there is more to do then go out to eat, see a movie, or shop. <br /><br />Last week I jogged a half of a mile. And my quad is still pissed off at me about the whole situation. It really needs to get over it and stop being such a drama queen about everything.<br /><br />Here of a couple of things that I have learned since the beginning of the year:<br />Friendships are not always dead they are just hibernating<br />If I am in pain&nbsp; I am still alive<br /><br />And the one thing that I am doing this year:<br />Making the things I hate doing the things I love doing instead. - This mostly has to do with working out. No more whining but I am allowed to complain if I am in extreme pain and having problems.<br /><br /></font></font>"

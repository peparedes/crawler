But yes. You are a toenail. You usually get in the way of peoples' lives and are annoying at times, but people hang out with you because you are amusing. You enjoy acting retarded in front of large crowds of people. Many may call you a dork and a loser, but the truth is that you are very intelligent, and this will be proven in the near future. You are dependent on your friends, but you are not willing to conform into society's stereotypical mold. You may be called a loser, but at least you aren't a nobody. Even the opposite sex finds your uniqueness attractive. You stand out, and that's what makes you special.

"event","<center>i'm just sitting here thinking
about so many things that blow my mind..
things that make my head hurt
and make me sick to my stomach..
there are so many questions i have to face
and answer that are so hard for me.
i love him so much
but we can't be together right now
and its tearing me apart.
i wish i had a lie detector
so that i could carry it around with me
and i would always know the truth
and i would always know when someone was lying
because i can't read faces
faces lie just as easily as mouths..
<b>,.:*sigh*:.,</b>
i wish life was easier
and maybe one day it will be
but for now it just seems so hard
...harder and harder everyday
and it makes me feel so selfish
and it makes me feel cRaZy
but i like the crazy part.. 
hmmMMmmmmM
and valentine's day is tomorrow
why o' why must there be a day of love
when i feel like this inside?
ok im through bringing everyone down
...for today... ;)

he knows what i've been going through.
it fits:

Bearing witness to a forgotten soul lost in tragedy, a lover becomes a widow. Clutching at the falling pieces of her broken heart, she curses the feeling she once called love, and clings to hope, that someday something will be better"

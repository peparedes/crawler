so i got a new tattoo.

fall semester is in full swing and things are busy but i LOVE my classes.
I am so super pumped because I get to see my boyfriend in 2 weeks and 3 days! I am so exicted. I have missed Matt so much. I love my house. I will have pictures up of it soon. umm this is horribly pointless update and i have decided i should do work instead of post here, so a more substantial update will be up later."

its exciting and i had a great birthday celebration on tuesday night and an interesting birthday.
My favorite part of my actual birthday was being in traffic and getting to see the whole fireworks display sitting backwards in the backseat of Tina's car while listenin to the plain white T's. It was odd I had been in such a bad mood before then and then that happened and it was great. I dunno it was just one of those moments. I am glad for it. It erased pretty much all the bad. 
I got awesome presents. I love my friends and my family. I am really blessed. I honestly don't care too much about gifts. I am happy no matter what you give me and even if you give me nothing. I am actually really glad that my parents never put alot of emphasis on gifts growing up bc I feel as though I appreciate them so much more and I value the experience of a birthday spent with people i care about more because of that. I dunno.

Lately I have been so acutely aware of my short comings and inconsistencies. This sparks in me the desire to change and be more of the person God designed me to be but I find myself struggling to accomplish that. I feel stagnant. I feel as though this is a bit of a pattern, that I go through this cycle every summer. I think I am going to break it.
Recently, I have realized that my actions have been such a poor representation of who I am, that my heart and my passion and who I really am is not showing through. My choices have been poor and I have no rationale to explain them. I have such a desire to be open honest and real with everyone, to live a life free from pretense and yet I still find myself putting up a front. And it isn't even a front I like. It's almost automatic, it seems to happens before I can make the conscious decision not to. I find myself thinking ""why am I acting this way, saying these things, this isn't me"" and yet I continue to. My outlook needs to be more positive. I find myself complaining substantially more than I would like and sometimes I don't even realize it. This is such a challenge.
This is such a trying time. So much has happened in this month or so of summer and I find that I was in no way ready for it. I know God will use these situations to grow me if I let him but I for some reason feel that I don't know how. I don't think I have ever been in this situation before, maybe I have and just have a poor memory. The one think I do know is that I still have joy.
Everything at the moment seems to be moving so fast. I wish there was a pause button on life, a slow down to half time so that I can experience life. Maybe I just need to do that. I need to stop planning away every second of my life and just live. I remember back in may the picture I had for this summer. It was a great one. It was of me in my capri's in the warm summer sunshine in late afternoon, in a field with trees just exploring nature. No watches, no phones, no computers, no schedule, just wonderful, beautiful nature. Silence. Calm. Overwhelming joy and contentment. That image was what helped me push thru the end of the semester and I have now arrived at summer and it is nothing like that. Maybe that is why I am so full of dissapointment right now. I long for that image to embody my times and spirit this summer. My summer will be what I make it. So now, I need to make it just that. I think that maybe I will do that today. I have to start somewhere why not tonight. I can catch up on some reading I have been wanting to do. Maybe go to the park. I think that maybe I just need time alone, alone with God. I have spent so much time with friends and that is amazing and I have loved every second of it but I need to clear my head, I need to get myself together.
Hmmm...I need to let go of inhibition. I have freedom that I don't embrace. That is a very stupid thing to do."

"event","Sometimes I wonder why exactly I still have this live journal. I almost never post to it and when I do I feel lame. Oh well.

So life has taken so unexpected turns since I last posted but I do not think I will go into detail about them. 

Right now I have a memory I want to share. 
So on a Friday toward the end of the semester Emily and Josh and I decide that we want to camp out at assateague so we can see the stars and then watch the sunrise. Both are amazing experiences. We then decide that we want Mandy to come but that we want to suprise her. We decide to make it a full on surprise. As freshmen Mandy and I use to dance around in the fountains on campus, we did it a few times sophomore year also but had not danced in the fountains at all junior year. So, I decided that dancing in the fountain had to be part of the surprise. 
We tell her to wear her bathing suit under her clothes and bring something warm. We blindfold Mandy, walk her randomly around campus and then over to the fountain, where I proceed to tell her to strip down to her bathing suit and while still blindfolded, tell her to trust me and take a step down. It was into the fountain and it was great. She then got unblindfolded. This was hilarious because by random chance, her younger sister who also attends Salisbury is sitting at the fountain with some friends. So yeah we danced around in the fountain and then we blindfolded Mandy again. To the next leg of the adventure. We then drive around the parking lot and campus a bit and then we get her out and change cars and then we go to wawa and walk around, getting the appropriate snackage for the main event. We then proceed to our final destination, all the while Mandy is blindfolded. 
We finally get there and there is another car that follows us in to the parking lot, which is unusual considering there are so many different parking lots you can go to at assateague, why pick the same one. Who knows. We get out and unblindfold her and we carry all of our stuff up to the beach and set it up. Its beautiful. Totally and completely. There were some clouds in the sky but you could still see the stars and they still faintly reflected on the water. Awe-inspiring. I saw a shooting star. I love shooting stars. 
The clouds eventually crept closer and there was some lightning. It never rained or turned into a serious thunderstorm but I freaked out a little when I woke up to that, I mean we continued to sleep on the beach but it was still slightly alarming at first.
So those people who came into the same parking lot as us, well they decided to go not that much further down from us and drink and smoke and makeout, and i am sure much more. It was AKWARD, to say the least. I mean if you want to get busy or whatever thats fine, thats your perogative but um couldn't ya do that a little bit further than 10 yards away. lol. especially when there is a whole beach. 
But that isn't really the relevant part of the memory just a side note.
So we wake up to watch the sunrise. It was cloudy, but it was gorgeous. I never get tired of the sunrise, especially the sunrise at assateague. The reflection of the sun on the water as it peaked up over the horizon was spectacular. The clouds were purples and pinks and oranges and it was magnificant. And the best part about that time was sharing with some of my closest friends, sharing it with the people who have impacted and helped shape me this year. 
I have grown and changed so much and their influence in my life has been a large part of that and I am so thankful for them.
The reason for sharing this memory is that last night I had a dream about sitting out watching the stars and having the sky be so full with cosmic dust and it was beautiful and there were shooting stars everywhere. It made me remember that memory.

ok well its safety day and i need to head over."

"event","I haven't updated this thing in over 3 months. The reason...the insanity that is being a nursing student.

God is so awesome, I am so glad Jesus is my savior. I have no clue where I would be if I didn't know him. 

This semester has been THE most difficult semester of my college career. I feel discouraged and unsure of what next year will bring. I eagerly await summer, and the rest that will bring. I feel like all my passion has been drained from me and honestly, I hate it. And its not just my passion for nursing, its my passion for everything. I feel worn so thin and stretched in a million different directions by a million and one different things. My mind is in a constant state of chaos...and I hate it. 
Next year will be different. I have a feeling about it. 
All I know though, is that God is going to work and he is going to do buckwild things and I  cant wait. 

Right now though, I need to focus on whats immediately infront of me and that is whether or not I will pass all of my classes. There is one that I am worried about. I dont know. I study so hard in that class, I know and understand the material but yet I can't seem to do well on the exams. It frustrates me, I am not sure why I am struggling so much. I am just going to keep praying that God will pull me through like he always does. If I get a D, that would mean I have to be in school an extra semester. Failing that class would feel like total and complete failure in life to me. I know that it isnt and that I have struggled with so much this semester with my health and with my family and with life and that has taken its toll but I want to succeed, to prove that I didn't let any of that stuff get the best of me, that I didn't let it win. The pride in me also thinks, ""Kelly Shuggars doesn't fail classes. Kelly Shuggars is smart and deserves better."" But that is only a whisper because the rest of me knows that sometimes even smart people fail and I desevere whatever it is that I earn and that if I get a D, that I earned it. ugh...

I feel so weary. Only about this one class though. Life is such a gift and I have so much joy in the new life I have in Christ. I love life and especially my life. I honestly have a great life better than 95% of the world and to be honest I have done nothing to deserve it, its such a blessing. What that means though is that I need to use what I have to make a difference. 

I went to displaceme this weekend and it was such a great experience. They had this video of a little girl talking and she had AIDS and my heart broke and I once again remembered exactly why I want to be a nurse and my heart was once again ripped right out of my chest for Africa. I can not wait to go, Thought I have to. I have to wait for God and his timing and his plan.

ok well I am suppose to be studying for my research exam tomorrow so I am going to do that."

"event","so pretty much, once again I am an idiot. I realized I have been sitting around imagining all the possibilities there are for me once I am nurse, all the places I could work, <B>all the money i could make,</b> the people I could marry(not too much to do with nursing but still in my head with the rest of the ""future"" stuff) and where I could live and who with. And then, then it happened. WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I THINK!?! God asked me to choose a path, the one where I stay here and do those things, or the one where I go where ever he sends me. At that pivetal decision point, where it was just me and God hashin it out, I decided I want ALL that God has for me. All of it. No matter what it is, or where it leads me, I want it. I want it desperately. And that for me, meant going to Africa, more specifically Kenya and Uganda. 
And here I have been rationalizing my way out of that earth-shattering life calling with 'maybe I am not suppose to go there for a job, maybe I am just suppose to go there for a short trip and thats really what God's asking, not really this whole life thing'. 
And its mainly because I am scared and its so easy to want a typical life, with a house and a car and a husband and family and the parents close by, but thats not what God spoke into my life, into my heart,even though it is so corrupt, and I let that corrupt evil heart of mine twist the wonderful thing He showed me. 
I wanted for so long to know the plans God had for my future in Africa, to be taken our of this ambiguous state of waiting, I wanted those details, and he finally gave them to me.
And then, then I go and deny them. I go and pretend he didn't speak them into my life. Why am I such a royal idiot? When he gave me that calling, it changed my life so completely and here I am running as fast and as far away from it as I can. I am letting the idea of getting married get in my way, its stupid, I know it. And I <b>HATE</B> it! This past week has been a re-realization and of God's calling for my life and that there is stuff that I will HAVE to do to make it happen, along with a recommitment to do whatever it takes. God provides me with the tools and the way but he never said it would all fall in my lap and be an easy breeze. That struggle to get to it is just what will prepare me for the challenges I am sure to face when there. I will not be silent about it and I will not back down. I will stand firm because I stand on solid ground and I  do not stand alone. I don't care what or who it is, fear included, I will not be pulled astray, there is a task ahead of me that I am putting all my focus on, and its serving and following my God. I will not let anything come between me and that, I can't, the rest of my life and more importantly the lives of many others hang in the balance. Its a choice, just like anything is, to follow God or not to. And I am reaffirming that I am going to follow him, where ever it leads, thru whatever dark valleys or dangerous waters that may take me thru. Its a passion that runs so deep inside me that no matter how far I run I can NEVER escape it, and I dont ever want to, and I thank God that nowhere is ever too far for Him.
ok i am finished with my ranting now...."

"event","So I haven't updated this thing with anything of substance in such a long time. I am going to try and make sense of the crazy things goin thru my mind right now. its radical, its ridiculous, its amazing.

I have spent most of this break in a giant funk. I don't think I have been in quite this bad of a emotional or spiritual funk in a very long time. I am so glad to be out of it. I realized recently how ridiculous I am. I have been in this funk and almost reveled in it. I sat in my room or at my house by myself doing nothing, talking to no one, watching tv or movies or listening to music. I was a hermit. I stopped going to things I enjoyed, I pretty much cut myself off from the world. I felt this whole time so far from God. I felt so detached and as though the gap would never grow any smaller. I ran farther and farther. Then I realized something. I realized why run from the only one who can ever comfort me, the only one who can ease my suffering? Why run from the only one who can give peace? I realized how STUPID I had been. I felt so ashamed of the state of my life and almost angry at God for everything that was happening to me. These things that should have drawn me closer to him and have developed growth and strength and trust, developed resentment, anger and stagnation. A personal choice. A dumb, self-righteous choice to think I could do this without him. I am so ignorant sometimes, so foolish. I don't think I cracked my bible open outside of a biblestudy once until a week ago. SO FOOLISH! 
The thing that really snapped me out of it was how God kept bringing up this one verse, Isaiah 44:21-22. He cries out for me to return to him but I continued to run so far from him. After the 4th time I heard that verse in the span of something like 12 hours I decided I needed to crack open my bible and pour my heart out to my God. 
I prayed for a really long time and by the end I had come to the decision that I was suppose to study James. James is such a short book, I overlook it so many times. James is SO powerful. I haven't even finished reading the second chapter. God has been revealing more and more to me, it is dense. I feel revived, my spirit feels alive again and I love it. 
My joy has returned. 
James 1, lead to 5 pages back and front of journalling. I read it through once and I realized that simply reading it would not be sufficient, especially not after this long period of self-inflicted stagnation. Each verse came alive and God showed me so much. I am so thankful for it. 
In my study of James 1, God also brought me back to a lesson we did at breakaway back at the very begining of November. It was on the proverbs 31 woman and the Godly women we want to become. I realized I hadn't even glanced back at that list of characteristics I apsire to since I wrote it. So I went back and read that list, and it was amazing to me how many things on that list where things talked about in James. God brought up my need to really reflect on my heart and motives in things. This past week I think I have changed a great deal and I think and pray that God will continue to do this work of refinement in me, I need it so badly, I yearn for his purifying fire. Change and growth are rarely easy, but I honestly couldn't care less, I never signed on for easy, since when did I want life to be easy? I love stepping up to a challenge. The more difficult the task the more I realize how little I can do and how MUCH God can and does do. My pride needs to be slain. 

I am so completely ready to be back at school. I have been renewed. I finished the semester so weary, prolly the most I have ever in my life been. But I will return more refreshed and alive then I ever have been. I want so desperately to be apart of the adventure that is following and serving my savior. Back almost 2 years ago when I decided that I was all in,I meant it no matter the cost and today more than ever before.

okie dokie now that probably everyone has stopped reading...i am going to end this entry there is WAY to much goin on in my head to contain it in a lj entry..."

this has been an insane past seven days...
i realize more and more how totally and completely selfish i am. its a bit ridiculous. who have i become? I realized today that i went almost half the day thinking only about me and things that affect me. why?! DANG IT! I always fall back into this trap and I hate it. when did i become such a big jerk? or have i always been one...i dunno. I am so off base sometimes. It seems as though I only serve God in the things that others will see and praise me for, and that is not my heart at all. This is not what I desire. I want no praise, no recognition, no notice, I just want to show people unconvential, all covering,completely blind love. But why do I struggle so much to do this? Simple put, because I am selfish. I wish I could shut up that part of my brain that always thinks about whats in it for me, and focus on what others need. Even this entire so far has been entirely about me. wait for it....I use the word ""I""....20 times, and ""me"" or ""my"".....7 times... wow. 

new years eve is 5 days away.

i watched garden state last night. i like that movie, its good. i have watched so many times before but when i watched it last night i noticed so many small things, minute details, seeminly insignificant lines. I loved it. 

I am excited to go the gym tonight. It will be so refreshing. I want it to be 4:30 so I am off of work and can go.

"event","so I realized that I started the last 2 entries with my world is swirling around me. lol. 

Right now I am sitting in my office at work. its thanksgiving break. I dont know if I want to go back to school come sunday. I do because I love school and my friends there. I just dont want to go back to the feeling of being overwhelmed. Maybe it wont be so bad. I miss my dorm room. I miss my friends. I miss passion. I miss living life to the fullest. 

Home is so different then school. I know this is an obvious statement. I wish that when I was home people were as spontaneous and random and adventerous as my friends at school are. Its funny because some of the people here at home are that way at school with me but when we are home they need to make plans like 10 million years in advance. I hate sitting around waiting for people to call. I guess its good that I dont have as much to do at home, it gives me a chance to sit around and relax at home. I have obviously needed the rest I fell asleep last night at like 10:30 and didnt wake up until 7, when my mom woke me up for work. Normally I dont go to sleep until around 1 at least. I got a full 8 hours of sleep last night. Its strange. I got like 10 hours the night before too. Maybe I need  to get more sleep at school. to bad I have to much work for that. I need to budget my time better I think. I need to be in the practice lab and the library more often. that way i dont fail out of school.

I want today at work to fly by. I want it to feel like 15 minutes. I want to get off work and hang out with my friends. friends make me smile :-)

I am happy for tomorrow, we put up the christmas tree. I loved the christmas music in the car this morning, it made me smile and be excited for life. I realized I am so immature and childish sometimes. Lets jump on the metro and see where it takes us. my thoughts are so scattered right now.


i am going to end this entry now bc i am no longer making any sense at all.

happy thanksgiving

so wow has my world been swirling around me, I can not believe that tomorrow it will be November... every semester I have been in college has flown by and this one has been no exception. Actually it has gone by the fastest. I am unsure about how I feel about it, i realized that there aren't going to be many more semesters of this, one more fall at salisbury with all my friends...it terrifies me to think of being in the real world and having real responsibility and a real job. mostly it scares me bc i know that I am suppose to spend my life in other countries helping people. And that terrifies me bc i have never left the country, let alone gone to Africa, which is where my heart lies, totally and completely at this point. Africa has captivated my heart. its ridiculous I know. there are so many reasons i shouldnt go. But honestly, at this point, I can't not go. There is this God given passion inside me for Africa and its people that I can not ignore any longer. It consumes me. All of me. I am sure I could get a standard job here, work my three 12 hr shifts a week, have an apartment and a normal life. But i know that i would never be even close to content. I am at this cross roads in my life and I can choose to go and live an amazing, adventurous life passionately following my savior or I can stay here and live in mediocraty loving my savior but living every day in disobedience to what he wants me to do. I dunno what to do. I know it seems obvious, right, choose to go, but there are so many road blocks that stand in my way, my parents and their support being the largest. I dunno I think I need to focus on this coming summer more than anything. Opportunties have been presented to me to go to various places in Africa and do medical work and I want so desperately to go my heart is being torn out of my chest right now for them but they cost close to $5000...money I do not have and I know if God wants me to go he will more than provide that money for me to go but I am unsure of if I am indeed to suppose to go. oh my word. well i have a test in under 15 minutes so this entry is being cut short and shall be finished at a later date.... so here is a little insight into my life at the moment."

so yeah...summer is pretty much gone. It has been a good one. I didn't go anywhere too exciting. I didn't get a chance to change the world in some other country, but all things in good time. :-) I have to start where I am with that.

so sum up of the summer...
swallowfalls, surgery,recovery,starlight mints show, birthday, kings dominion, mxpx show, no picnic and coolhandluke show, girls night, becca and trevors wedding, beachin it with the  fam and iggy, fresh digress show, new bike, beachin it with katie kit kat kosko, cpr training, thai food with matty, sarah and bill, beaver dam, ozma and the rentals show,  hannah's first birthday party, sewing, leadership summit/weekend, soup kitchen, visiting keylay mufasa.....
and inbetween all of that I had work every monday-friday 8-4:30 sometimes til 6:30 and intermission every tuesday night and biblestudy every wednesday at lunch and then another biblestudy every wednesday night at 7. I did some babysitting in there too.

I had some good times. I wish that I was able to go to purpledoor this year but I have way to much packing to do and not enough time to do it all, and no one to go with. Its cool maybe next year. I thought I was going to be able to go to the breakaway weekend but I cant anymore bc again I need to pack like whoah. 

I am soooooooooooo PUMPED to go back to school. oh man you have no clue. I want it to come faster but I know that I am no where near ready packing wise and I do not have my new car yet. My parents have informed me that I will have ""restrictions"" on it, like how much I can drive and such, which I find slightly ridiculous, but it is there vehicle not mine so I have to listen to them. I understand that they do not want too much mileage to accumulate on it but to tell me that I can only come home for christmas is a bit crazy. I think thanksgiving will okay too, at least I hope it will be. It is not like I can stay at school :-\ something will be worked out I am sure, I know that they will want to see me, so its okay. lol they are just happy to get rid of me now lol. I give them a week with me gone and they will miss me like whoah. hahaha oh family.

Let me just touch on the leadership weekend. WOW. that is the one word I would choose to describe that weekend. The speakers at the summit were great, I learned so much. I am still trying to process most of it right now but give me another day or so. Bono's interview was life-shaking. God really re-ignited that passion in my heart for Africa. I prayed alot about it that night, I had to because I think too much. God gave me alot of clarity on the subject of missions and my calling. And I am forever grateful for that. So pretty much He wants me to go to Mexico this winter, and maybe more then just this winter but He showed me that He is the one that gave me this heart for Africa. I understand that there are many capacities in which I can serve besides actually going there, but He really revealed to me that I am suppose to go there. To be there with the people, to show them his grace and love, To serve them. And I want nothing more than to be in His will for my life, to be an empty vessel for him to fill. All this fear I had earlier about going is gone, vanished. God shined his light into the dark places in my life and has shown me that there is no where that He will send me that He does not go first, so I can take confidence in knowing He is there and He is working. Something Krista and I talked about on sunday night after visiting the most awesome Kyle, that I feel really tied into that was, that God does call us to things, but if we dont do it, if we pass it up because of fear, He will call someone else to do it, He does not <i>need</i> any of us, but he <i>chooses</i> to use us, <b>if</b> we are <i>willing</i>. I dont ever want to pass up his opportunities for me, so I will go where He sends me. I want nothing more then to be useable by God. I never want to be at the point where I am inflexible or hard toward his prompting on my heart. He sparks motion in me with a breath and I love it. 

The Other thing about the leadership weekend that really rocked my world was getting to know the people on the leadership team. again WOW. They are some awesome people. Blew me away, Totally and completely. I had so much fun with those kids. Talking the first night was cool. They all make me laugh like its their job. J.MO and Eric especially, Holy mother. Half the time I thought I was going to pee myself lol.  The drives to and from the conference were probably one of my most cherished times. We had some great conversation. *side note* Jonathan's car is SWEET! I want to steal it. Getting to talk with him and lauren monroe was A-freaking-mazing. He really suprised me. I didn't really know him before but wow is he chasing after God, running with all of himself and that is so awesome. He has this passion and it leaves me in awe. He is one of few guys I have met that really have a heart for Christ and his work.  Eric too blew me away on that. Both of them are so passionate Christ and doing the will of God in their lives. It was so awesome. Its good to finally meet some strong men of God, Not that I dont know some already. Listening to that talk in the car on the way there on the last day was awesome. It just put words to things God has been teaching me and it really set up for God moving in us later that day at our planning meeting. Um playing games with everyone on Friday night was fantastic. I had never played spoons, it was alot of fun. I didnt play zoom, mainly bc I <b>HATE</b> that game with a passion that burns deep into my soul lol. but the last game we played, it was called like snap crackle pop or something like that and it was great too. oh and Snarf or whatever its called was hi-freaking-larious lol oh my word was that THE BEST game I have EVER played. lol oh man I crackup just thinking about playing that game. Getting to know all the girls was probably my favorite part of the fellowship side. I think it was Thursday night, we sat in the living room and laid it all out there. We went around and said what we thought was our biggest flaw, character wise, and then we went around and encouraged each other by sharing what really stood out about each person and the things that we just loved about them. it is soo cool to hear other peoples thoughts on you. I loved getting to share my own thoughts on them with them because they are some awesome women of God like whoah. they chase so hard after God and his will. I am so glad I get to be in fellowship with them so they can spur me on to keep running hard toward God. 

Something that I have really come to lately is that I want to be more modest in the way I dress. I think I need to be, actually. I dunno I am not going to get into it but yeah thats that.

ok so on friday a bunch of us are camping out in natalies back yard and man am I SIKED!!!!!!!!! wow just yea it will be a freaking blast oh I cant wait. and to go to the show tomorrow too oh man oh man! i am going to have a kick-butt time. 


okay well this entry has been entirely too long for my taste so I will end it here. Congratulations to anyone who read this far :-)"

"event","ok so let me tell you.....
my weekend was a BLAST.

beaver dam just rocked my world. i have to admit i chickened out of doing the rope swing. my fear of heights got the best of me.
but the jumping off the rocks was run the swimming around the fun with friends oh man.
yeah so after beaver dam on saturday i went home and then went with natalie, markie mark and the funky bunch, topher and some of their friends to see ozma and the rentals at the 930 club. I had tons of fun. mark is one cool kid him and nat are great together. so yeah the show rocked had fun at the metro station...saw a guy wearing a rather short light pink dress, pink chucks, pink pearl earings and necklace, and lip stick. his hair was normal he had on his glasses everything else about him was manly besides the attire. it was funny, but i felt bad too bc some kids were actually laughing aloud at him while he sat there and read his paper. it made me feel like a jerk for thinking it funny the first time. to each his own. it does not suprise me too much bc i have definitely seen weirder things on metro. 

ran into wardell on the metro, we got on the same train at shady grove. I got to chat it up with him for a bit which was cool. lol and he was actually on the same train on the way back, but different cars, we got off and saw each other it was funny bc he was coming back from a salsa club in adams morgan and we were comin back from 930 club but we managed to get off and on at the same time. i just love how things like that work.

um but yeah got home at like 3 in the morning...it was worth it. hannah's first birthday party was sunday afternoon, i was exhausted for it. i had fun shes a cute lil babe-a. then i went up to the track for a run. BIG MISTAKE! let me just tell you. i was kind of sore from all the standing and such the night before and i was tired from goin to bed so late and so i should have just decided not to run. It was real hot and humid at the track for some reason, i hadnt thought it was bad out when i was at home so i am not sure why it was so gross up at the school. So yeah i ran, not as much as i normally do but its cool i only did 2.5 miles. then i started to feel REALLY sick. i felt like i was gonna puke my brains out. i felt kind of dizzy and my head hurt. i hadnt been running that hard so it doesnt really make sense, i was well hydrated, i made sure of that, i had tons of water and gatorade all day before going and had a bottle of water with me that i drank while running, so i dunno. but all i know is that i really messed up my body. I was so sick yesturday, pretty much all morning I thought I was gonna puke. Felt a lil better in the afternoon, decided i should prolly eat something so i didnt go into hypoglycemic shock and such...I have been so physcially exhausted, all i want to do is sleep all of the time. i am sure i'll be fine, just got to rest it up this week. 

I think i might not go to icecream after intermission tonight. 
I was going to go to the thing for keylay tonight instead of intermission so i could see him before he leaves for texas and forgets about me, but my mom and dad said i wasnt allowed to go bc of how crappy i have been feeling and because they dont want the car to break down when i am by myself at night in some place i am unfamiliar with and such bc that would SUCK big time. i am so bummed about not getting to go. I wish i had someone to go with me so that i didnt have to worry about being alone when i go and then maybe my car wouldnt die lol. i think my parents are going to finally go and get me the new one when i am away at the leadership weekend bc i only have 12 days til i go back to school 

maybe i can get Em and krista to go with me sunday to visit him before he leave and such that would be good. 

this entry has become extremely pointless....
so i should probably just end it here and actually do some work...

"event","so i am at work running some stuff and waiting for it to all come back so i am going to update my this silly journal.


so i have been doin alot of running and with that running alot of thinking. the things that i process unknowningly while running are amazing.

i really love running, if i could do it all the time i think that i might. i mean actually i can if i really wanted. if i had the ability which i know i dont.

Yesturday was a particularly interesting time. it was the most difficult time i have ever had running. It was so hot and humid. I realized how much i dislike people around me when i am running. There were 2 other girls at the track running and then a good portion of the the highschool football team doing conditioning. I could not focus. I could not push anything out of my mind. Highschool boys are annoying. I mean honestly they are like 15 and yet they felt the need to whistle and such at me as i ran around the track...I am 20...I am 5 years older than most of the boys out there. what?! i mean really have they ever heard of respect? apparently not and apparently the coaches havent either bc they didnt do a thing about it but laugh. *shakes head* oh the world and its crazyness. I get so distracted when i run. the other girls running frustrated me lol bc i wanted to pick up their pace instead of setting and keeping my own. the heat and humidity never helps i was dripping with sweat after a half a mile...i finished out that mile and then did stairs bc being on the track was way to frustrating...then i did hills...its going to be too hot to run tonight the air quality isnt very good...my asthma was kicking my butt yesturday and it was cooler than it will be today. 

Maybe I will just go for a bike ride. break in the new cruiser....actually that sounds really nice. bc it will be rather leisurely but still a some cardio. hmm or maybe i will just go shopping and tanning lol...

I love going on bike rides with people...thats gives me fond memories...two specifically...

1. right before freshman year, about a month before i left for salisbury natalie and i went for a bike ride on the path to the highschool, it was right when i got my new bike for school. we just rode around racin' and talkin and laughing and having an amazing time. It is one of my favorite memories with natalie.

2.less then a week before leaving for school sam and i decided to go for a bike ride on that same path. we raced...he beat me everytime...I had such a good time. Its my best memory of being with him. I remember being so happy. I remember actually enjoying myself, really enjoying myself, which unfortunately, is something i have very few memories of with him. We spent alot of time sitting around watching movies. This was different, it is one of those classic memories. The day was so hot, but it was great. I think if I had to have a memory to commemorate that relationship I would want this to be it. It does not reflect the overall tone of the relationship in the least, it was a rollercoaster of emotions, but I want to remember the good things that happened instead bc I learned alot about myself, and who I am, and who I want to be. I experienced alot of new things and I can never regret it. It has shaped who I am. 

ahh i love running off on a tangent.

its this music i am listening to...oh the spill canvas....

hmm so intermission is at 7....
i get off work at 4:30...
I will get home at 5...
I could....
do a variety of things...

hmm oh how the day lies with possibility...or well the evening does anyway...

Oh!!!! I just realized I dropped pictures off at walmart to be developed and they will be ready today! oh man! So that there is what I think I am going to do! lol. 
so hmm biking tanning photo picking up...sounds nice to me...

I am excited for these pictures...I can finally scrapbook...I have the pictures to put on the pages oh joyeous day.

Another random realization...I go back to school in 19 days....
NINETEEN DAYS!!!! and most of them are already filled with plans...
this has led nicely into countdowns...which i have not done in awhile so no complaining can happen :-)...

My Countdowns:
Beaver Dam trip:4 days
Ozma at 9:30 club with nat and friends:4 days
Hannah's first birthday party:5 days
Leadership summit:9 days(technically 8 bc we meet up on wednesday night)
Soup Kitchen:12 days
last day of work!:2 weeks and 2 days
Copeland, Lovedrug, and ActionReaction @ the ottobar:2 weeks and 2 days
Purple Door:2 weeks and 3 days
Move-in: 2 weeks and 5 days
First day of Classes:3 weeks and 6 days
First Football Game:1 month and 8 days

those are the ""big"" things happening the rest of the summer... I have intermission every tuesday and biblestudy every Wednesday and sewing next monday... so the free time left is minimal

let me count the free evening and days left in the summer...
4 free evenings...
there are no more free days...
wow....
and one of those will be spent playing a mean game of volleyball with andy and kyle and peoples and another one of those shall be spent at ikea with the most beautiful sheena getting stuff for our room.

ah! summer is gone! ahh! lol i did not expect it to go so fast, though at the begining i felt it was going too slowly..oh the perspective after the halfway point in summer passes.
somewhere in there the parents are getting me a new car... I do not have a free evening to give them the car...well thats not true lol I have 4 lol or well 3..hmm maybe i am going to have to cut something short... maybe not go to intermission or biblestudy one time or something...hmm...maybe the parentals will want to look at vehicles this evening? I doubt it...my father hates to make plans last minute but yet he has really been putting off this car thing...ahh!

this also makes me aware of the fact that i need to start really cleanin up my room and packing up my stuff...i think that i know the plans for this evening now...

1. clean room up...
2. bike a bit...
3. tanning...
4. pick up pictures...
5. intermission...
or maybe ikea...

okay this entry has gotten way to long and pointless... it has become my venue for thinking thru my plans for the evening and that there is when i need to end it...okay so yeah"

"event","so as much as i went on about how much i couldnt wait for the freedom of owning my own car....
i retract it. lol
the parentals are buying a new/used car for me to drive, better than the one i have now. and i will not complain bc i dont have to make car payments and i dont have to have a job at school. though i might still.
freedom-smeedom. lol
they said that if i move to salisbury next summer i will have to get my own vehicle then but if i am still living at home and i can still use it. so i think that i will probably continue to live at home...its just much simpler that way lol. i am ridiculous. OH WELL! lol.

God is amazing. he changes hearts in a beat.
just wow.

but the show last night was rockin.
i mean i have been in love with LN for quite sometime now, but live gary murray. just wow. he thought that bryan was the only one who knew any of his songs but its not true. i held my tounge bc i desired to see what he would choose to play. something about his voice penetrates deep in the dark cold silence of my soul. i love it. ALOT.

if i didnt have intermission tonight and if my car wasnt spontaneously retarded i would drive to lynchburg to see them play again tonight, cause i mean map rocks too. but alas circumstances are what they are, maybe i will be able to see them sometime when i am at school. 

but yeah now its time for me to go to lunch. peace."

"event","so there is this sign that i walk by every time i go to the bathroom at work and its a picture of 2 chocolate bunnies sitting next to each other and one has a bite out of its tale and the other a missing its ears... and the one missing its tale says ""ow my butt hurts"" and the bunny without its ears says ""what?"" and i just find it hilariously funny. every time, never fails. i think i have seen it at least 3 times a day everyday since i have been back at work since like early june. and i still laugh when i see it. hahah i am ridiculous i know. umm but so other things that are of more importance....

so my winter break is officially going to be spent in mexico. maybe not the whole thing, i am unsure of the dates right now. but yeah. i have no idea where i am going or what i will be doing but my god-father is contacting the people to tell them when i am available to come and they are setting it up. he met this guy from a church there when he was at a conference in texas last week. he might have actually known him before but i am not sure, but yeah the church has one in texas and a sister church in mexico and they would love if we (our group that meets, word a fire ministries) would send people and so wednesday night at bible study he told us all about it and God just smacked me in the face with it. okay so back story to this, and go:
*for my whole life pretty much, i have felt so called to missions in other countries, but every opportunity that has arose hasnt worked out, mainly my parents sayin 'no way jose!' and so, now lets fast forward to a year ago......since then my life has really been more on target with God, he ask all or nothing? and i said all. and even more i have felt called to go to other countries....Africa is a continent that has been on my heart like whoah. so this past year i have been looking in to africa and trips that would be going there and praying on it night and day and still feeling unsure and every time the idea of south america and mexico kept coming up. and i was thinking it was just my wanting to ""test it out"" ya know toes in the water thing before i took on africa. and thats not what i wanted to do at all, i want to jump full on in. i dont need to test it out if its what God wants for me, i want to go in without fear bc he has called me to. But at the same time i dont want to go where I want to go, i want to go where GOD wants me to go, i dont want to go to africa bc i want to, i want to go there bc thats where GOD called me. but so i read passion and purity as most of you know. and when i was reading it elisabeth elliot struggled with something kind of the same. she thought Africa was where she was called, only to find out it was south america. And let me tell you, when i read that, talk about a pull on the heart. and so i prayed about it and God kept bringin it up...and me being, well me, ignored it mostly. And so finally a couple weeks ago i asked God to open the doors to the places he wanted me to go. and its continuely been my prayer. and so when i was talkin to andy on saturday and he was tellin me bout how he was leavin for mexico on saturday(tomorrow), God tugged once again. and to God i was like ""mexico?? are you sure?? doesnt africa need alot of help?"" and to that he responded ""you ask for my will not yours, and here it is"" so i was like wow! okay then do your thing and show me exactly where i am suppose to go, make the path plain and i will do it.* 

And that brings us to wednesday night at biblestudy when my god-father mentioned mexico briefly, and man did God smack me in the face with that door he opened. lol HE ROCKS! God is just so awesome sometimes. and so i prayed about it that night during bible study and afterward felt like i was suppose to talk to my God father about it and so i did, and he was like when you want to go, let me know and i will tell them you are coming. and so all i had to do was write up a synopsis of sorts on why i want to go, why i feel led, what i want to do while there, and what i am willing to do while there. and he will contact him and let him know. and he also said he has alot of other contacts and he is going to let them know. and so to be prepared for it bc there are going to be alot of opportunities coming my way. And you know, there wasnt an ounce of fear in me, i was overflowing with Joy and i knew this is what God has for me. I dont know exactly where in mexico i am going yet, but i know that this church is where i am suppose to go, and i know that i am suppose to go sometime over winterbreak. part of me wants to be home for christmas and newyears and be with family and friends, and a small part of me hopes that maybe i will have that special person in my life at newyears or whatever..but another part of me, a much larger part of me, thinks why? why not be in mexico? you arent going to be home for every christmas, and who gives a flaming crap about a significant other, Gods business is much more important and i want nothing more than to be faithful to him. and i realized how little i really honestly am worried about the whole boyfriend crap. God's gonna do his thing, in his timing so who cares about what ifs and what might happen. So yeah. my mom predictably said but you need the money from working over winter break. i knew it before she said it. its all that she thinks about when it comes to me. but thats the thing God is our provider, Jehovah-jireh. And he does provide for me everyday, when things look impossible to men, they are impossible for men, but not for God. It brings him Glory.

It something that has been a revelation to me recently....especially with things for next year. everyone tells me my schedule is impossible i wont be able to do all the things i am committed to, there isnt enough time in the day. But the things i am committed to, are things God called me to commit to, i know that he makes the impossible, possible, so i dont doubt. People will ask me how i do it, and i will honestly tell them I dont, God does. I dont have to triumph over anything ever again, because christ already has. I take comfort in knowing he conquered death so i can, he conquered all sin bc i cant by myself and i love it. i dont ever have to worry bc he has got it covered totally and completely. Just wow how powerful and amazing is that? i mean really!

I submit my will to his, because its better. He knows me better  than i could ever hope to know myself and he only wants whats best for me. All that i want is to bring him glory, for my life to be living praise to him, to be holy like he is holy. and he refines me, purifies me with the fire of his spirit. i am always brought back to my favorite verse 2 corinthians 12:9-10
""But he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.""

i push on because i know he will heal me, he will deliever me, and my triumph over them is not my own, it is his and he will gain Glory from it so i have overwhelming joy.

ahh man its easy for me to get fired up when i think about all this.

so yeah.....

oh and tomorrow....tomorrow i go car shopping....i have done extensive research on the internet about different cars and gas mileage and pricing and such but yeah the loan application was put in the afternoon and tomorrow we start looking at dealerships and yeah....man am i scared! lol its a large commitment its a step into the real world unlike any other steps taken so far...its real hardcore responsibility, its monthly car payments. lol though a large part of me is totally excited bc it means my parents cant tell me where to go or not go bc well its my car! and woohoo! no more broken car-ness yay! so um yeah...thats that i think that i probably wont actually get it until the begining of august but that is um rather soon i must say, it does happen to be the 21st of july and august is right around the corner. 10 days til august and then 20 til i go back to school. yeah i know 30 days til i go back to school. a bit redunk if you ask me. but man am i pumped about it!

okay well now that i have rambled on for far to long i shall go. i have some stuff i need to finish up here at work. though, i must say, this was a nice, much needed break.

much luv to ya guys!"

"event","okay so its friday.

so wednesday.....i left work early, i left at 3 and drove to walkersville to pick up none other than miss melissa joy mcclain. and wow. that there is where the fun began...
i love that girl she rocks my world! so yeah i get changed out of my stinky work clothes and into something a lil more fun. yeah and then we drive down toward my way and pick up none other than the great T-nate. 
then we hop onto 270 and head toward annapolis. we were doin pretty well til we hit 495 and then, well then we sat in traffic. i despise traffic. i think that my driving scared nate and melissa more than a lil bit lol. um but to continue...so yeah we left nates house at 5 and didnt end up getting to riva trace baptist until 6:45, missing all but one song by no picnic...disappointing, very much so, bc well lets face it i think they pretty much rock, and not just bc i know andy. 
um then another couple bands came on, they werent too shabby. 
then cool hand luke. i mean honestly i love them, ALOT. borderline obsessed....since the first time i ever heard of them i was in love. umm but their set was amazing. and then another band came on i dont remember there names they were fun i really wanted to dance to their music but there werent alot of other people there and so i felt akward 
um and then the apathy eulogy came on and i really like them, they are so emo but i dont care. 
so yeah i had alot of fun at the show and then after that melissa, me, nate and kyle drove to edgewater to see miss emily victoria moss, at camp. which was the highlight of my summer.i was able to give her the birthday present i bought for her and we all got to talk and it was awesome. i miss that girl like whoah. then we made a wawa stop bc i was in desperate need of caffination and nourishment, though the nourishment didnt really happen, i ate string cheese....and a 24 ounce cup of french vanilla coffee. the ride home was good, a bit long but i had passengers to keep me company and good music to listen to so it was fine. nate was nice enough to ride with me to melissas so i didnt have to drive back to germantown by myself, i didnt trust myself to drive alone at like 2 in the morning running on so little sleep and food, he is a gentleman, he probably got like 3 hours of sleep...i feel horrible about that. 
yesturday i would have updated this with all the excitement from the show but i was way to tired myself. i was running on 4 hours of sleep at most...i took a caffine pill in the morning along with having 2 cups of coffee, then at lunch it was another cup of coffee. and i was still fighting to stay awake at work... man but was it worth it, way worth it. :-)

so now its friday....and i am a bit more rested today, i got 8 1/2 hours last night so that was good.

but tomorrow is saturday....the day of becca and trevors wedding....and i still do not have someone to go with me...this distresses me more than you can know. its really hard to not have the thought that i am so horrible to be around that not even one friend said yes to going with me. i hope that isnt the truth, i'd like to think that i wouldnt actually have any friends if that were the case but its easy to feel that way when you get a big whopping set of no's from people. And to add to, it I HATE, absolutely hate, asking people to go with me to things, not that i dont enjoy their company but its something that creates great anxiety in me and i have had to do it multiple times for this wedding and have gotten turned down all over the place.its not like i am looking to have a ""date"", i just need a friend to go, i am not going to know anyone outside the wedding party which will make it distinctly less enjoyable if i dont have a friend go with. i am rsvped for kelly and guest...bah! this is getting to be extremely stressful. i dont want to worry about it but thats an impossibility bc its tomorrow. i could push it out of my mind and be irresponsible, which i think i will do, for a little while at least.....mainly so i dont go insane and so i dont bore/scare the few people who read my lj.

but anywho...tonight is the girls night for college ministry and i am excited. it will be alot of fun and fellowship. i am pumped.
i leave for the beach on sunday man i can not wait! a short vacation will be nice. just relaxin at the beach...oh and running on the beach in the mornings oh man how sweet and glorious that'll be i love running on the beach. quiet times at sunrise, i love appreciating all of God's amazing creations. i love the ocean at sunrise its one of the most beautiful things  i have ever seen. its so humbling. me and the fam are only going for sunday-tuesday but it is sorely needed, and 3 days is generally enough for me before i get bored and wish i was working again. 

i need to be working alot now because i am going to be buying a car before the summer is up. oh man oh man, that is rediculous. I, me, will be buying my own car. i will miss the malibu, i am slightly attached, but i need a vehicle that breaks alot less and that gets better gas mileage, oh and that doesnt have like 110,000 miles on it after only 5 years. i think that next week we are going car shopping, at least looking around. my parents will also be buying a new car, the difference is that theres will be brand new and mine will be a new used, though i plan to get something nice, a 2003 or 2004 probably. i dont want to spend alot but quality matters much more. we are going to go thru a dealership that way i dont have to dump out 10,000 or so all at once, lol. i bet it will end up costing me more than that though, but if it will last me a good long while and it will get me to and from salisbury frequently over the next 2 years, than its worth it, bc i dont know how much more my current car can handle its 150 miles each way, and i will most likely have to do that once a month thats 300 miles a month not including anywhere else i have to drive that could be real rough....

ok so you guys are probably bored to death so i'll will stop with all this unimportant nonsense...i hope that everyone has a beautiful and wonderful day and weekend.

"event","so on monday night.......i went to the mxpx show at 9:30 club and it pretty much rocked like no other. i mean it was great. didnt end up meeting up with bryan...he ran into some friend he hadnt seen in awhile, it bothered me a lil at first when i was there but then i was like what? why are you being ridiculous? you are at a freaking awesome show get over it and have a good time. and ya know i did. I love mxpx, i have since i have like music, well any semblance of good music anyway....got to dance like crazy during their set it was great. I realized i really dont mind going to shows alone. this being really my first one alone. i realized that i am like that. Especially alot more recently i just enjoy being alone, dong things alone. I feel bad bc sometimes i look like i am snubbing someone, that is never my intent. Like my mom, sometimes i just want to run errands by myself but she always wants to go with me, and i feel bad telling her i'd prefer to go alone. it has nothing to do with her personally i just want time alone to do what i need to do. i dunno...thats just an example. Ever since the summer started it seems that all i ever want to do is be alone, i mean i love hanging out with my friends and going places and doing things but i guess i like the freedom of being alone i can go when and where i want and if i dont want to talk to someone i dont have to. i know that most people would find it difficult to belief that, I, kelly shuggars, wouldnt want to talk, but its true. i enjoy silence, and i enjoy thinking. i dunno.

but anyway....
so tonight me and miss melissa joy are going to annapolis to see No picnic play with cool hand luke and some other bands. I am pumped! our worlds are going to be rocked and i am psyched! I miss melissa so i cant wait to see her! she is just amazing! just wow. i love being her friend. lol i finally get to give her the birthday present i have for her, i have had it for a million and one years its like over a month late but its the thought that counts not the timing right? i dunno

but so i was listening to bethany dillon last night on my drive home from intermission and these words just stuck with me they are from the song ""hallelujah""...""Whatever's in front of me, I'll choose to sing hallelujah"" just wow. that has soo been my heart lately. just wow. meant alot to me when i heard my heart put into words. it was great. ok well its officially lunch time so  iam going to end this completely random entry....

"event","so i havent updated in a good bit so i thought maybe i would. So tomorrow is my 20th birthday. I can not believe it. 

This summer has flown by, slightly to my relief but also slightly to my dismay. I am glad for the break from all the work that school entails, but i miss my friends and the freedom i experience while at away at college. Don't get my wrong i am enjoying seeing all my friends from home, but its not the same. I have to make plans ahead of time. What? LOL I know that the concept of planning isnt a bad thing, but school has allowed me to get in the habit of NOT doing that, and I rather enjoy it. I dont have to call people 3 days in advance to see if they want to hang out, I merely call them 3 minutes in advance. The hanging out is rather random and spontaneous and fun. There doesnt have to be a set plan. But at home i have to call and have a definite plan of what we are going to do, when we are going to  do it, and how long its going to be. I dont necessarily enjoy that. If i dont do those things i am left to sit around my house either by myself or with my family and be bored. I despise that. I am in no way a home-body. Though i do thoroughly enjoy my alone time, I dont need it ALL the time. 
While at home I am in constant conflict about dating. Most of the time i dont give a crap whether or not i am dating someone, I am single by choice. But everyone i know seems to be dating someone seriously and they love to plan their activities where its a whole bunch of couples and I always seem to get left out. I know i am single i dont have a boyfriend or whatever, but thats my thing, why does it have to be couples hanging out with only couples? Or maybe its just that they dont like me, and the couples thing is what it seems to be on the surface. I dont know. Generally i am okay with being left out bc i can find something else to do but I hate it when all i hear when around them is what plans they are making together to go out with some other couple. It happens right next to me, and after awhile it really gets under my skin. Makes me wanna punch someone in the freaking face. Everyone i know who has a g/f or b/f lets that person consume their life. Why? Dont you want your own life? I mean granted it happens to almost everyone, it seems to sneak up and seep in without notice until it has completely taken over and you feel like your drowning, or maybe you dont i dunno...
i dont want to be that wrapped up in anyone or anything besides Christ. but maybe thats just me. i dunno i should stop ranting about this bc its stupid and pointless and will most likely piss someone off...
its not jealousy that drives this entry, not at all. I DONT want to be dating anyone, but every once in awhile i wish i was so that i could actually get to see my friends....
the fact that i feel that way, to me seems sad. I have alot of really awesome friends here at home but i see them like once a week, maybe, bc we happen to attend the same bible study or college ministry, or whatever. This here is the reason i wish that i was back and school and the semester was in full swing...

Even when friends disert you though, Christ is always there so I take heart. 

But on a less ridiculous note........

wow am i learning alot this summer, God is showing me so much about him and about how he wants me to live and who he wants me to be. So i read passion & purity by elisabeth elliot and am now doing a biblestudy with it with the ladies from our wednesday biblestudy. Its such a great book. WOW. talk about speaking to my heart. I see so much of myself in her and that inspires me. I also started reading Quest for love, the companion book for p&p also by elisabeth elliot. Another hit with me so far. At first i was like hold the phone, back that train up, WHAT!? but then i realized she wasnt saying that this one way of doing things, this one example is how everyone has to, its just what was right for him or her and what God brought about in their lives when they trusted him and waited on him. I love it. Waiting on God isnt always easy but i wouldnt want to wait on anyone else. When i have my journal with me i will be put more here about it, quote and stuff that meant alot to me and things God revealed to me, sometimes having very little to do with the chapter i was reading but lol he works that way doesnt he....i love it.

0ne thing that has been intensified in my heart is my desire to do missions. I feel more and more that i am called to it. It scares me, but it excites me more. I'll go where he sends me.....no matter the cost.....

Lately i have been doing alot of reflecting back on my life and who i was and who i am....and why things happened how they did....
Man am I COMPLETELY different. I most like the difference when comparing who i am now and who i was in middle school, i know that we are all bound to change substantially in that time period but wow i dont even feel like the same person.
My heart and spirit are so different. I love how God refines me.

But yeah, my birthday is tomorrow and i want to go to dc with my friends, i kind of wanna see superman returns at hte uptown theater and then see fireworks on the mall but if it rains it may not happen but hopefully the backup plan will be movies and yummy food and then fireworks in gaithersburg....but we shall see.....i should check the forcast and with friends to see what they would be up for and then well set plans in stone i want to have a great birthday, and i know i will if i am with my friends :-)
I also have a pretty bangin birthday cake from maggie moo's so yeah.....
okay well i should end this random and insane entry now"

"event","so summer is in full swing!
went up to swallow falls last wednesday and thursday talk about a good time, minus the falling...lol and the stepping in disgusting water lol but its all good i mean would our memories of it be as good if i hadnt provided such comic relief? lol  em brett and josh picked me up at my house on wednesday evening and we drove up to frostburg to stay with T-nate nate and people. we got the frostburg experience. i enjoyed it. taht was such a fun trip i am sad it had to end so soon. i babysat on friday, made a killing and had fun. found out one of my friends is getting engaged i am so excited for her! saturday i slept in really late.....my sister and her fam came over for dinner then sunday i rode in a limo to the mall for a 4 year olds birthday party. it was fun. i think that i officially want to work at Club Libby Lu in tysons corner. lol i think it would be one of the best jobs ever i could really enjoy my self there. not that i dont like my job here at home its not too bad at all. i work with nice people and dont have to work nights or weekends and i get off holidays so thats bangin but Libby Lu you get to do little girls hair and makeup i mean come on what do i enjoy more than doing hair and makeup for people? well besides baking and cooking nothing :-) i am so weird its cool
um so then after that i went home and then i went for a run. i ran about 2.5 miles. i wasnt too disappointed with that distance. I normally do a 3 mile run but it was so hot and humid and i hadnt brought my water that my mouth and throat were so dry i decided 2.5 would have to do. i love running on the path though, its just so beautiful. i love running. i kind of wish that my bike wasnt rusted beyond belief its what 2 years old and unrideable stupid parents for leaving it out in the snow all winter 2 years in a row. i love riding too, so i kind of wish i could do some this summer. it would be a good transition back into running after my surgery, lower impact on my ab muscles but still a nice work out and fun. i dunno. ok so yeah. then monday i got up early and went to the store with my mom to get stuff for my room but i couldnt find anything that i had been looking for so it was in vain...well not completely but yeah then i spent pretty much the whole day cleaning. cleaned out my closet which was a mess beyond belief...got rid of everything in it and then organized all my stuff from college and put it in there. that really cleaned my room up. yeah then i hung out with natalie. we called up nathan and went to jimmy cone. it was soo good to get to see nate, i miss that kid. we ran into a bunch of people he/we knew....it was interesting i hadnt seen them in awhile and i felt slightly akward. though there are many social situations in which i feel akward. i need to get better at that. then me and natalie went back to her house and watched matchpoint. talk about brilliant! i mean really. i love the tie to crime and punishment oh man! i cant not love something that incorporates my favorite novel i would be daft if i did. lol. it kind of made me want to re-read crime and punishment again. oh man i have read that book more times then i can count these days. um yeah.

so now that i have just killed you with boredom i will stop talking about the happenings of my life....

but i mean wow. i have surgery in 2 days....blows my mind....i am so scared for it....it doesnt make any sense for me to be scared i have had 3 other surgeries but yet each time i get ready to go under the knife i am more nervous than the time before...this is ridiculous, i am ridiculous. i have tried to rationalize these fears away...so has everyone else i know. i am going to be fine. God is looking out for me. It is a standard percedure, my doctor has probably done at least 100 of these but i still cant help being anxious. I need to trust, i need to stop letting the devil cause me to doubt. that is my biggest down fall, lack of trust thru hard times. i mean honestly when has God NOT pulled me out of crap? never. i jump on in to horrible situations and he pulls me out, generally unscathed, though a bit wiser. This situation i am not jumping into but he will pull me thru it. And i have tons of amazing friends to come and visit me afterward which will be a joy, probably hilarious for them because  i will be so thoroughly medicated. but i mean its cool.

I am excited for everything God is going to do in my life this summer. I am growing so much, maturing, changing. I know that by the end of the summer i will be astonished at how different i have become. I am especially excited for Wednesday bible study at lunch at work. I always learn so much from the people there, they inspire me, they encourage me, they spur me and I love it. I am super psyched for the new college age ministry starting up at Senecca Creek it is going to be rockin. i am going to the big kickoff barbaque this evening at 6. i am pretty excited i hope alot of people come that would be really great.

ok well i should be doing my work so i am going to.
i am excited that kyle brett and sauce are coming to visit me after surgery i am even more excited to get to bake for them :-) i love to bake! so i am a dork and i am going to stop this entry right here and right now..."

"event","wow so i go home tomorrow. the semester is almost over. i cant believe it. i dont want to go back home. this is such a contrast from last year. i was ready to be home i didnt really like school that much i mean i had friends and i knew i would miss them but i wanted to go home and this year, school is my home. and i love it. i love making my own choices with out consulting my parents doing what i want when i want. staying up til 5 am with friends and not getting chewed out about it. i love my apartment and my apartment-mates. this year has been redunkulous to the max. i have gone thru so much stuff and i have changed SO much. and i am happy with who i am. finally. i am who i want to be, or at least i am becoming that person. God has taught me so much thru the people he has surrounded me with and i wouldnt change a thing. not one. not even being sick and in the hospital, as much as that is still such a heavy burrden i have matured and grown stronger thru it. I perservered and will conquer it. I will triumph because I dont have to overcome this He does and God will. that brings me to my favorite verse 2 Corinthians 12:9-10 
""But he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.""

when things are hard i shouldnt complain because i dont have to, its hard yes, but who ever said it would be easy? I dont have to do anything but follow christ and do God's will and the rest will be taken care of. Yeah i will still have crap happen, but why worry about it. i know its alot easier to say than to do. i definitely know that because i worry about stuff ALL of the time. I complain i am melodramatic constantly, but i am working on it. i want nothing more than to be humble and quiet in spirit, and gracious and thankful for what i have and trusting in the Lord for all he is doing and going to do. I want a life that glorifies him. and its not because CRU says i should but its because its the desire of my heart to please God. I know that pleasing him isnt what saves me, its the all covering merciful blood of Christ that when i accept it and ask for forgiveness cleanses me, but that there has changed my heart to desire to please and Glorify him. I still screwup on a daily basis, pretty much every hour of everyday i mess up but ya know he forgives me he has got it covered.
wow. i just cant even believe how different i am right now than i ever have been. 

so excitements that are coming up....going to swallowfalls on wednesday! um yeah! talk about being psyched! I am also excited for all that is going to happen over the summer. not really surgery which is rapidly approaching, but getting to see my friends and visiting them and having them visit me and just hanging out. man it will be great. 

okay well now i am going to napp it up a lil then study til 2 am in the library....."

"event","ok so the updating hasnt been too frequent....oh well time flies way too fast.
so the semester is about to wrap up to a close and i am terrfied about it bc i have so much work to do and i am such a lazy bum i need to spend more time studying and less sitting on the couch watching shows on the style network or less time on this here computer....i am at the moment procrastinating...i should be packing up stuff and/or studying for the massive amount of finals i have coming up that i need to get A's on and for the 3 tests i have to make up on reading day.....being sick sucks it really screws up your ability to do well in school well it just makes you work harder and i am but pulling the grades i want will be so much more difficult...

so the weekend rocked friday night was fun me and mandy went to lighthouse at like midnight it was fun walking there is always a joy.....talking there is even better laughing at the redunkulously drunk people is hilarious......

um so saturday we had cheerleading tryouts that was good it was long and tiring but good. then i drove around with lawrence then me mandy and tina got all snazzed up and went for dessert at ruby tuesdays it was fun we took pictures and were fun then we hung out with nick and halston and the bunch had a dance party...redunkulous things happened...i was lucky enough to end up with a really bruised elbow and a bump on my head along with a headache....but it was fun then me mandy halstage and ian wandered around campus ran thru the lawn infront of halloway and then spun in circles on the tennis courts and looked at the stars ran thru some sprinklers played around in the fountains it was good....

sunday, on the other hand was not that great of a day. woke up feeling SO sick and then as i am getting ready for church my mum calls and tells me my dad was in the hospital and i just felt so stressed and sick and upset so i ended up getting back in bed and not going to church then i hung out with tia to do some planning for SOW team then we went to leadership then me and mandy went to dinner then i went to a cheerleading meeting then finally at like 11:30 i got back to my apartment and watched some season one gilmore girls episodes then i finally fell asleep

so now its monday night and i should be packing but i am not bc i am the biggest procrastinator in the world. i am getting up at 8 tomorrow to drive home and then go to towson to see people and then go to the recher to see underoath poison the well and as cities burn and hang out with andy...
the underoath show may or maynot happen depends on if i have someone to go with and if at the end of the day i really want to go by myself if no one can...

i am excited for that but totally and completely nervous for my doctors appointment on wednesday morning........i feel as though it will be so stressful i dont want to have another surgery over the summer but at the same time i am so tired of feeling this bad...for once why cant i be normal like everyone else and not in constant excruciating pain? taking narcotics on a regular basis is not something i enjoy in the least...........
but enough ranting on that, i know God has purpose and plan in everything that is happening to me and it will all work out for his glory and my good and i have to trust that he WILL pull me thru this i just need to wait on him trust him be patient for his timing...
the devil is good at exploiting my frustration...

ok well i am going to stop the ranting and start the packing

peaceout!

"event","so i am updating again....to procrastinate again.....
so easter weekend was A-mazing. i liked seeing my family and getting to relax. On saturday night i got the best phone message ever in the history of phone messages. kyle, sauce, matt, grace, and brett were over and miss emily moss's house and they all called me and left me a message exclaiming their love for me...i mean i am all about that lol. so i am psyched to see them at the retreat this coming weekend. i miss all of them so much! last night i was really torn about whether or not to go on the retreat after talking with tia because i felt like i wanted to be here for relay for life, cancer research is something close to my heart at the moment,even though its for really selfish reasons. but also i wanted to get to do something with our team. but then i prayed about it and examined my motives and i realized i had impure motives for both choices so i asked God to show me where he wants me and the more i think and pray about it and the more i talk to people about the more i realize that i want and need to go on the retreat. so i am going to go. i just need to pay k'lynne

so today i got to hang out with melissa joy and let me tell you it was quality. i love that girl. we ate lunch then she went to do some rehersal stuff then she came by my apartment and we went and got our eyebrows waxed and let me tell you they did an amazing job, then we went to walmart and got crafty stuff and then i got some groceries. and she bought me a super awesome sippycup thing its a bunny and its purple and it has a straw thats green and a teal cap. i love it!i am gonna be sippin my juice in that sucka everywhere! you know youre jealous! we had alot of fun. i am going to make this awesome sweet and sour chicken thing and we are gonna eat it and its gonna rock. man i love that girl we had so much fun. 

so right now i am reading I Peter and let me tell you God is just revealing so much to me right now. I am also really excited that we are reading ephesians. its a good book.

ok so some verses that mean alot to where i am right now......

Psalm 27:14 ""Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.""

Proverbs 4:23 ""Above all else, guard your heart, for it affects everything you do.""

2 Corinthians 12:9-10 ""But he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.""

so God has shown me some really big things recently. The things that is really cool is that he keeps unfolding these things in my life and showing me more about them. Nothing big but the intricate details. I just love it. he is purifying me, refining me with his love and i long for it. i think its cool to reflect back on my life this past year, i have been doing alot of that lately. I have been going thru my journals from this year i have 2 that are finished and i am on to my 3rd. this is a really neat thing to do because it allows me to see Gods promises fufilled, and to see my prayers answered, and to see that when I call on the Lord he is there for me always. It has given me alot of perspective on things.

So last night i stayed up until 5:30 in the morning. Talking on the telephone with my best friend of all time Matt Carlson. Who it was a conversation i needed. I can always count on him to put things in perspective and to encourage me. its funny i realized that even when i pretend to be okay he knows when i am not and he knows exactly what to do to get me goin again. we made some cool plans and i am excited they are vague and very open ended but i am okay with it. because i know that when the time comes to solidify them we will and it will be awesome!

ok well so its a beautiful day outside...and i am sitting inside updating my lj and rocking out...i feel as though maybe i should be outside

so i might do that...

peace out"

"event","gasp because i am updating twice in one week. i know its a bit suprising but since i am not allowed to attend my classes and i dont want to lay in bed until my advisement appointment i am going to update.

yesturday was a beautiful day. it was one of my best days in a long time. my thoughts were so much clearer, everything was just amazing. i finished taking the medications for the allergic reaction on monday so tuesday i was only taking the pain meds and let me tell you drastic difference in my reality. i felt so much more normal. i wasnt having to strive to look, and act, and feel normal it was just kind of happening and i liked it alot. i got kind of excited and inspired so bake a whole ton of cupcakes for my friends. i made like 60 cupcakes and then gave plates of them to cool people in my life. i love doing that. i hope they enjoyed them. i think i was baking all day yesturday i started at 10 am when i made breakfast and the cupcake making started and i didnt finish until TNT at 8:30. i thought it was going to be exhausting and that i wouldnt want to bake anymore for awhile, but not true, yes i was tired but not like i had been and it made me want to bake more. man i am a dork. 
robin said to me kelly will you be my mom? it was funny. everyone said oh man you will make an awesome mom but i mean really i wont bc if i bake like this and do it often my kids will be fatties....thats not being a good mom....lol 
and besides who said i want to be a mom....oh man girls my age are so funny. all they think about is getting married and poppin' out babies, they are getting degrees to be moms and thats cool but its just not my style, its not what i want to do with my life, i want to live life i want to experience it i want to do everything i want, to go cool places and live on my own and be free i mean i have every desire to get married and do all of that but why does it have to be right now? this exact moment? we arent even out of college.. my attitude completely reflects the fact i dont have a serious boyfriend, or a boyfriend at all for that matter and thats okay bc i am so waiting on God and his timing I dont need to rush any of that, with all the crazy stuff going on with my health i dont even know if i'll be able to have kids so thats not the stuff my hope is in, its not in the boyfriend or husband or that family life and all the things that are going to happen, its not even in the exciting things i can do or my career, my hope is in Christ, and I wont ever be let down, i wont ever be disappointed. And that there excites me. Alot.  
Dont get me wrong there are plenty of really awesome available guys i could be throwing myself at, all of them amazing men of God, all more than worthy of dating but its not my heart to give, is it? The day I ask Christ into my heart when i was 4, it became God's heart, its his property, its not mine to throw around and to give away, if they want it they cant take it up with him :-) I know that God is going to put my heart some where great, he is doing it right now, and he's doing things and it makes me excited, really excited, I am not going to lie, but i CAN wait for it, i can wait for the best he has for me, i am in no rush, i see where rushing and being impatient has gotten me so far and let me tell you its not anywhere good and it wasnt anywhere you'd want to rush toward. 
so i can be content running with all i am toward Christ and ya know, when its right, that man will step up and blow away everyone else there ever was, and he will be bold and persue me, he will have taken it up with God and God will have given him the okay and we will have an amazing relationship center on Christ and it will be great. but till then why dwell on it? why pick out the dress? why plan away life.....because honestly who can say we will ever get there, and who says things will ever happen as we think they will or think they should....so right now all i am doing is holding on to God's promises and enjoying being Kelly and God because let me tell you its pretty awesome 

okay well thats enough of that,my trains of thought are so interesting.

so other things that are on my mind are what i am doing with my summer. i mean there are certain things that have already been set in stone for my summer pretty much with out my approval but it happens those things being surgery at the end of may and working 40-hour weeks but i dunno i kind of want to go back to mississippi or new orleans and do more relief work. it has my heart. helping people IS my heart. i long to do everything i can and they need it. i having been trying to find some week or 2 week long trips down there with churches i know but so far no luck. i dunno i need to pray on it more, i know its something that will make my parents really unhappy they want me to work and make money, and i do too but thats not the only thing that matters in life... also i want to do alot more fun adventure stuff. i want to learn to sail i want to go places i havent before even they are near my house there is so much i want to do. i want to spend time with my friends i want to wake up every morning and thing sweet its another great day! not what i felt every morning last summer....man i can not wait for this day to be over....i dunno well i have an advisement appointment in like 20 minutes i should maybe get ready for it......"

"event","ok so wow, the updating doesnt really happen often. i apoligize for those few who actually read my lj. so there were requests for an update so i am doing it....to put off a whole ton of work i need to do.....

ok so it is freakin april.....there is just about month or so left in the semester and i cant even believe it.
um its been an amazing semester except for the recent illness thing....missing alot of classes isnt exactly my idea of a good time...i understand that that makes me the biggest dork that ever lived....but i like learning and going to classes means knowing the material better and getting better grades which i am all about. um the spring retreat for Campus crusade was this weekend and it was alot of fun. i am so glad that i went. i know that i wasnt suppose to go and that i was suppose to be on bed rest or whatever but umm i personally think that sucks and i know i would have been so much more discouraged by that bc everyone pretty much went. yeah i think i pushed it a little did more than i should have and let me tell you payin for it but it was worth it, it was more than worth it. I am so thankful for the amazing friends i have. i dunno i have just really been blessed because they straight up rock. 
hmm so what else have i been up to well last weekend me and miss. emily victoria moss went to towson to the Recher to watch this guy Andy's band play we met him when we went to Mississippi over spring break(yeah i'll get to that i am going in reverse order) umm that was so much fun NO PICNIC ROCKS! um yea we got back late sunday night i just had so much fun, it was an amazing end to a horrible week yes it led into another bad week but it was a really good high point between... umm so yeah

lets see so spring break happened....it was soooooooooo much fun let me repeat sooooooooooooo much fun. best thing i think i ever did. so I went down to Mississippi with Baptist student ministries at salisbury and we gutted and rebuilt peoples houses for them. it was amazing a bunch of other BSMs from schools in maryland came and we all stayed together in an elementary school it was awesome, at the same time it was eye opening and just really showed me that as a nation we pretty much suck. we really could care less about each other. like honestly? i am not going to rant about this, actually i just did, i spent 30 minutes being infuriated but then i decided that it would be in better judgement to delete it out so i did....trust me you are thanking me :-)
um yeah so we got to go boating on the bayou 2 days after we finished working on this guys house he had row boats and a paddleboat it was so much fun. man and new orleans was such a cool place to visit i hadnt ever been there it was an experience. umm ok so i am tired of typing i am sorry there isnt much detail but maybe on another entry i will do the whole spring break experience....

.....countdowns lol i know these are everyones favorite hahaha
til i go home for easter:4 days
til cheerleading tryouts:19
i dont have my calander with me so unfortunately this section had to be cut short :-)

ok well i need to be studying for a test  i have to take today, actually i need to be studying for the 5 tests i am taking this week....so yeah i am going to go do that now...."

"event","wow so its been over a month since i have updated. alot has happened. being back at school is good, i have been insanely busy i hope i dont die bc my classes are pretty much raping me, actually only one class and it is called chem 122.....i wish that my teacher was better at teaching i mean really he is a nice guy but he doesnt do enough examples. meh but enough of that. so i have met some new people this semester which is awesome, mainly dan, ben, kevin, gannon and doug who i met thru tia. hanging out with tia has been awesome i am so glad i get to see her more this semester, i wish i had last semester....but yeah been hanging out with mandy and tina and the boys a good amount which has been cool and fun....hmm what else oh yeah i love my roommates i am glad i live with them. though confusion for next year has already ensued i dont know who to live with and i dont know if my current roommate krista wants to room with me again next year, if not its fine but all i know is i dont want a random roommate, i have the option of living in the same apartment as sarah fisch which would rock out pretty hard but i dont know who i would room with in that situation....hmm i just need to pray about it and talk to some people though we sign up for housing relatively soon.....ahh confusion....ok well its late and i should to bed maybe i will update more later....maybe not.... nite"

"event","so this past weekend was a blast. 
on friday i went swing dancing with the salisbury/umbc crew it was fun. so it was me, natalie, tina, iggy, will, andrew, and ryan which was cool, crashed at iggys for the night then me and natalie went home, 

when i got home hung out with matt metzger, we went to his dads house and watched the redskins lose (bc they suck) umm and his friends mike and jason were there which was cool that was fun, then they invited me to go to party with them but my parents suck and hate me so they wouldnt let me go, me and matt drove around a bit and talked before he drove me home i enjoyed that caught up with him alot which was nice, then i he dropped me off at home and i went over to katie-kit-kat-koskos house and we scarpbooked a bit while watching sisterhood of the traveling pants and talking then i went home and collaged and did some art bc i was so frustrated with my parents making me feel like iam 15 then i slept 

so sunday i went to the 9 oclock service and krista and sheena came which was cool, then i went with my mum up to hagerstown to visit my aunt rita who is in rehab for her hip replacement surgery shes gotta learn to walk again....it was nice seeing her, then my mum being my mum stopped at costcos and then walmart before going home then i drove to matty metzgers house and we chilled, we watched trainspotting and he played some video games bc you know how much of a dork i am for liking to watch video games resident evil is a great game and we went to eat at chili's which was fun then we watched law&order svu and then i drove home. it was such a fun day i miss hanging out with that kid. while driving home my mum calls my cell to see where i was at it was barely quater after midnight and then i get home at like 12:45 and she is sitting upstairs waiting for me to come home? i mean seriously where's the trust....what did she expect me to come home trashed or something? i mean honestly.....hmm so then i did some more art bc again i was frustrated. 

so then monday i didnt have to work bc it was a holiday which was sweet, though my parents thought they should wake me up at 10 and then again at 11 and then again at 12, its my freakin day off why cant i sleep in unitl noon? i probably would have slept til 11 had they not woken me up at 10....but whatever so i spent most of the day cleaning up my room then me and the mums went to walmart to get storage containers for me to take back to school bc i desire organization for that room sooo much, i go insane with the messy state our room gets into so i bought a bin to go under the bed and then a small dresser thing for in my closet and a tiny dresser like thing for my desk for my art stuff and pencils and pens. after i got back from that i was suppose to go to ikea with my sister but when i went to her house to pick her up she didnt want to go so she had me stay for dinner which was umm mcdonalds....yeah nothing like a homecooked meal so we ate and then watched some tv then i went home and cleaned a lil more and did some more art and scrapbooked a lil then talked to andrew and went to sleep...

now its tuesday and my lunch break at work and work is going by slowly but i mean i get paid...i want it to be over right now though. after work i am going to the eye doctor to get new glasses because i can barely see out of my glasses anymore...and i have this weird red super dry patch next to and under my eye, i think it might be eczema i havent had too much trouble with that since being on advair and allergy medicine but i noticed that its gotten really dry there bc my eyes have been watering alot and saline will draw moisture out of the skin...i duno i guess we will see...i havent decided whether or not i want new frames, i guess i will have to look around at the ones they have and price them i dont want it to be too expensive for the mums but i have had these frames for forever it would be nice to get a new pair maybe a different style who knows after that its time to head to the gym and go from flab to fab i'll prolly do 2 or 3 miles on the tredmill then lift for arms today give my calf another day to rest and heal up some.....hopefully i will get into bed before midnight tonight so that i wont be so bloody tired tomorrow...

i am excited for tomorrow its colleens birthday and we are going to baltimore to celebrate with her! i am excited hmm which reminds me i need to get her a birthday gift... 

man winter break is almost over...i have mixed feelings about this...before this weekend i couldnt wait to go back to school but now that i have gotten to hang out with matt i think i will miss having that opportunity...not like i wont talk to him or whatever but i guess i feel like i went so long without seeing him and i am afraid i'll let that happen again bc i am an idiot and i get so caught up in my stupid life to make time for my most quality friends. i feel like there are  few people who see me for who i am, before i thought it was pretty much just matt carlson who did but after this weekend i think the glorified image matty metzger held of me is shattered and he see the real me, mixed feelings about that i mean that glorified perfect image of myself was obviously not right but i guess i am the one who created it, and i guess having people see you that way makes you feel like you are closer to that, i guess i let the image of me stand because there is a part of me that wishes i was that person...but thats the thing i'm not and i'm okay with that i dunno i think that this all sounds more than a little melodramatic so i will stop with it and move on to other things
so i am thinking of getting a job when i go back to school. where at i dunno i am going to apply at a rack of places and see who will hire me to work 10-15 hrs a week.....
so i am psyched because on sat the 28th i am going down to salisbury and i am gonna get to see joyeous joy and then sunday we'll be moving back in....11 days baby! cant wait i miss that girl like crazy! 
hmmm winterbreak has been so interesting a million and one times better than last year no drama just fun :-)
ok well i am going to stop this update here bc this is the longest entry in the history of man.....

so loveyas"

"event","ok so its time to update bc that is what i do.
so winter break has been amazing. spent my time with friends. gone to the gym...ummm gone to D.C. like its my job. lol gone every weekend i have been home bc thats what i do.... lol umm and i have been working alot
umm so new years resolutions...
dont normally make um but i am going to this year bc its fun...
maybe i will actually keep them

ok so here those suckas are!!!!
new years resolution one: go to the gym...get back with my running and be able to bench 135 again....
new years resolution two: laugh more and take life a little less seriously have fun and be happy
new years resolution three:be more compassionate, i feel i have let my cynical nature get the best of me, and God has shown me compassion so i should others the same
new years resolution final:work harder in school, put forth effort and not procrastinate

umm ok so there we go.....
i think they are challenges but i really want to do those things. i probably just doomed all hope of ever doing those things by making them new years resolutions but lol it happens

ok so this is in here bc it something the most wonderful andrew read to me lol it make laugh like nothing else "" irth that filled all hearts left no room for resentment. Meantime Tryphaena, sitting on Giton's lap, was now covering his breast with kisses, now adjusting his wig so as to set off his face in spite of the loss of his ringlets.
    For myself, so chagrined and impatient was I at this new and unexpected reconciliation I could neither eat nor drink, but sat looking grimly askance at the pair. Every kiss they exchanged wounded me, and every artful blandishment the wanton employed. I knew not whether I was the more incensed with the boy for having robbed me of my mistress, or with my mistress for debauching the boy. Both sights cut me to the quick, and were far more painful than my late captivity. To make things worse, Tryphaena never vouchsafed me a word, as she surely might have to a friend and a once favored lover, nor did Giton deign so much as to do me the common courtesy of drinking my health, or at the very least speaking to me in the course of general conversation. I suppose he was afraid, just at the commencement of renewed favors on the lady's part, of re-opening a scarcely healed wound. Tears of vexation wetted my bosom, and the groans I stifled under the guise of a sigh all but choked me.""

lol its soo fun and so random....life life life 

hmm so some scripture thats been on my heart.....
James 1:2-8
 ""Dear brothers and sisters, whenever trouble comes your way, let it be an opportunity for joy. For when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character and ready for anything.
    If you need wisdom--if you want to know what God wants you to do--ask him, and he will gladly tell you. He will not resent your asking. But when you ask him, be sure that you really expect him to answer, for a doubtful mind is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. People like that should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. They can't make up their minds. They waver back and forth in everything they do.""

i dunno it has really spoken volumes to me about my life and about God...i love it when that happens

umm ok so work has been pretty good and my friends rock! i have so much fun and i love it 

babysat tonight and made $60 for 4 hours and it was fun cant wait to do more of that 

umm kind of missing being at school though....i have so much more freedom 
ok well this update is finished i am so random and so scatter brained... so yeah loveyas!"

"event","ok so i am home on winter break and i am pretty psyched. It's nice to have a break from school work though I'm pretty sure I'll be missing school in like 2 weeks. lol i dont miss the work i miss my friends i guess. so yeah. so i am kind of disappointed that i wont be getting a 4.0 this semester. hopefully at 3.8 all i am waiting for is my statistics grade. i am pretty sure i rocked taht final so i mean i better get an A in the class, i did really well in it it was easy. i have no idea why my grade hasnt been posted, i know krista's hasnt either and she took hers before me. I thought they had to post grades within 48 hours of the final but apparently not...i wonder if something happened with WEBCT since we had to take it online better not have lost my amazing test score I will be a little upset...ok so now that i am the biggest dork in the world for caring that much about grades i'll stop talking about them...
and so christmas is so soon i am kind of nervous i just started my christmas shopping lol, leave it to me to leave it to the last minute. 

Cant wait til friday, me and my fam are having a christmas party. it should be a blast. i cant believe that it is almost 2006. where has time gone? i mean really i feel like it was just yesturday i graduated from highschool. but man am i getting old that was like 2 years ago. lol. working over winter break should be good. I'll make alot of money and wont have to be bored all the time....well bored all the time at home being non-productive. i get to be bored sometimes and productive at work so yeah....ok well i should be doing my work...this was a pointless update i dont know why i even bother

so saw harry potter at the midnight opening in OC. it rocked let me tell you. i went with my 2 bests and the rest of the gang. we had fun. hanging out at iggys beach house before hand was super fun. oh man so i love harry potter for serious. oh man. so this weekend has rocked besides missing my roomie bc she was down in Virginia at VMI's ring figure. so yeah the weekend started thursday night in OC then on friday i hung out with nick halston and jer and we ate icecream and played video games and then i went and visited mandy exactly one floor up and she was to say the least a lil drunk....lol it was fun then she came down with me to the boys suite and we hung out there for a lil then she left and then we tried to get jer to dance and it was rather unsuccessful then we all just danced. dance parties are fun specially when you act stupid then we watched tv and then it was late so i left so they could sleep. then saturday was fun too woke up at like 1:30 and the boys and mandy came over and i made pancakes in the apartment. it was fun wish i had had some chocolate chips or some blueberries bc that is def alot tastier then just regular pancakes but oh well maybe next time. then we watched a movie on cartoon network ummm then me and tina hung out and i got ready and we all went to dinner which wasnt particularly fun i mean it was commons and it was crappy commons at that. um so then we went back and hung out in the boys rooms and nini halston and jer went to a party and me tina and will went to walmart and got games and a nerf gun and played with the skateboards or i did anyway and the hollahoops and then we played with wills scooter in the parking lot which was alot of fun i now want a razor scooter. hmm then we went back to the boys room and played guesswho and then we went for a walk and i used wills scooter again lol and then we played uno and then started watching a movie then nini halston and jer came back, nini and halston were a lil bit drunk and very funny. umm so yea we didnt finish watching hte movie but did crazy fun things lol college is great. umm yeah so thats my weekend so far. woke up this morning not being able to breath..glad i have my inhaler right under my bed. um so i didnt go to church i slept thinking maybe i would feel better but alas i do not i'm not weezing anymore but i am really congested so thats always fun. krista comes back today and i cant wait i never see her anymore. i live with her and i never see her its funny how that works. ok well i am going to finish cleaning my room and maybe do some homework or maybe get some lunchage. who knows. ok well peace!

"event","i am updating again. i know right its outrageous...i never update.....so hmm let see some countdowns would be appropriate... lol i know how everyone loves those

til i go home:5 days
regents cup:6 days
til harry potter 4 comes out:1 week and 5 days
thanksgiving break:2 weeks and 2 days 
finals:5 weeks and 1 day

so this weekend was pretty fun hung out with will and jeremy and tina the roomies and it was fun. kinda a lax weekend with lots of movie watching


so verses that mean alot to where I am in my life right now:

""Dear brothers and sisters, whenever trouble comes your way, let it be an opportunity for joy. For when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character and ready for anything.""-James 1:2-4

""God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it.There is no judgment awaiting those who trust him. But those who do not trust him have already been judged for not believing in the only Son of God.""-John 3:17-18

""The apostles left the high council rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer dishonor for the name of Jesus.""-Acts 5:41

""For the word of God is full of living power. It is sharper than the sharpest knife, cutting deep into our innermost thoughts and desires. It exposes us for what we really are.""-Hebrews 4:12

""and he will give you all you need from day to day if you live for him and make the Kingdom of God your primary concern.So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's trouble is enough for today.""-Matthew 6:33-34

""The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give life in all its fullness.
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will leave the sheep because they aren't his and he isn't their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.""-John 10:10-12

""LORD, remind me how brief my time on earth will be.
       Remind me that my days are numbered,
       and that my life is fleeing away.""-Psalm 39:4

""No, O people, the LORD has already told you what is good, and this is what he requires: to do what is right, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.""-Micah 6:8

""I am leaving you with a gift--peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give isn't like the peace the world gives. So don't be troubled or afraid.""-John 14:27

""Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done.""-Philippians 4:6


I know thats alot of scripture but man has God put all of that on my heart. wow so I have so much to think about things are slightly crazy....

At breakaway on wednesday emily moss asked us if we think we are pretty when we look in the mirror and i keep thinking about it and it makes me sad bc i havent ever looked in the mirror and though that, not at least that i can remember...i realized that i never feel pretty or desirable and i hate that i should be content, God blessed me and made me exactly how he wanted me, designed me down to every detail and yet i am malcontent with his creation, i shouldnt be but its so hard to see something worth loving when i look at myself...enough of this negative selfimageness i promise i am not fishing for compliments i dont want them bc even when i get them i dont believe them and i dont like feeling like people are lying to me bc they feel sorry for me. i know thats depressing but mood is mood...why i am putting this in an lj entry i am not sure maybe i will make this private who knows....

change of topic...

I cant wait to go home on friday and spend time with my mom...she gives good advice on what to do....even though i know exactly what to do i need to hear her say it...oh well ok well i am done updating....no one needs cares about my randomness

this semester has been the best time of my life and i am so glad for the friends i have they are fantastic i love them!

"event","once again sorry for the lack of updating....

so I love school it rocks. i'm a dork i know.
so classes are going well, difficult but not too difficult, enjoying them.
so man i really love my friends. they happen to be amazing. this school year has been amazing. it is a million times better then last year. i thurougly enjoy staying up late watching scary movies....and not so scary movies.....
i love how in the halloween movies michael myers pops his collar...i mean how priceless is that.....my deduction is that all ppl who pop their collars are obviously psycho serial killers lol...ok maybe not ALL....
so yeah i am not all about having an ulcer...like really.....but i mean it prolly wouldnt be an ulcer if i had gone to the doctor i dunno say 2 months ago when i started having stomach pain so thats stupidness on my part but i guess thats how it works
other then that i think that everything is amazing...oh wait NOT...bc both the deathcab and my chemical romance shows are sold out and thus i can not go....makes me mad.....but i mean oh well maybe i should try and buy tickets a little more in advance.....but still doesnt take away from how much it royally blows!

um so the countdowns.....i know you are desperately awaiting these......lol not...bc i know that everyone hates them bc they make pointless entries...which is actually their appeal for me...lol

countdowns:
krista's birthday:2 days
halloween:2 weeks and 1 day
regents cup:3 weeks and 6 days
thanksgiving break:5 weeks and 2 days
exams:1 month and 3 weeks and 5 days
winterbreak:1 month and 4 weeks and 1 day

so in the upcoming week i have 3 exams...its sweet...not really. hopefully it wont be too bad, its spanish, abnormal psych and micro lab....i really should start to study...lol ok well i should actually be sleeping right now so i'm going to bed.

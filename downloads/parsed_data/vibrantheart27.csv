Love isn't a salutation, so many people only tell people that they love them when they're gettng off the phone or leaving but thats not what love is.  You tell relatives you love them, but thats not what it is either.  So many people think they are in love when it's only lust but they never know the difference.  I have love, I really do.  I'm so scared because I want this forever, that sounds horrible and almost stalkerish but I do.  I honestly don't ever want this to end, it feels like I'm finally living now and makes me question whether I ever was before.  I'm scared because I'm young, and suposably ""young love"" never last and isn't love in the first place.  Well I know that one of those isn't right because this is love it has to be, I thought I had it before but I didn't.  Yeah, I've told past boyfriends I loved them but I didn't know what that meant at the time.  Cory, your such a great person and if you read this I'm sure I've scared the shit out of you and wouldn't blame you for leaving me as soon as you were finished reading but I love you.  I think I should probably just stop writing now but I don't care if this is me in a shitty mood, or this is me being ""emo"", but this is me, this is whats in my head.  The only thing on my mind is this and that I'm scared and can't say any of this to his face because I don't know if I want to know what he would say.  Please don't ever leave me."

"event","So he called today and I was in there car with my mom and when he had to go he says ""I know your with family so you don't have to say it back but I love you.""  I didn't say it back.  God I feel dickish!!!!  He's so fucking good to me and just because I'm around my mom I can't say it.  I think it's partly because I've been so afraid of it for so long, it's not that I don't want people to know that I love him because they know, and I just hope he does.  It's not like I've never said I've loved him before, he knows and I know he does but I just feel dickish for that.  He gets back tomorrow night and I'm extremely excited, apparently he has something for me and wont tell me what it is but oh well just getting him back will be enough.  I think I'm going to go, I really need some sleep.  Since I know you have the link to this now, I love you Cory, I really meant to say it on the phone but I'm just scared and when I'm too scared it wont come out, I'm sorry but I do love you, please don't ever forget or doubt that."

Apparently they only recorded two songs yesterday so he sounded kind of disappointed but I think they are still going but he said he wasn't having any fun which is no good.  I have a doctors appointment today in 2 hours so hopefully I'll be semi better by time Cory gets back.

So I just watch movies and stayed in bed all day, being sick sucks huge clown penis.  It's not that long until he gets back so I'm happy, but if I'm still sick when he gets back I'm going to shoot someone in the foot.  I did kind of get some kind of contact with him today though he messaged me through myspace and he even said he was going to call me but you know how this stuff works I'm sure he was really tired.  Speaking of tired I didn't get very much sleep and I myself and pretty worn out.  Ha well I think I may be off then, hopefully he'll be able to call me tomorrow"

He'll be home soon so I guess I'm happy and I think I'm getting a bit better so thats sweet.  I just want him to come home and I wont have to deal with all this!!!

I'm so out of my mind right now because he said he was going to his friends studio and recording a cd for me.  SONGS ABOUT ME!!!! HOLY SHIT!!!  Okay I'm glad I got that out ... wait ... THIS IS AWESOME!!!  Okay I think I might be done now.  Sometimes I really can't believe this is real, it's just a dream that I'm going to wake up from and everything will be back to normal but I love it.  I don't deserve this, this is just crazy.  Ever other guy I ever had all my friends said I was too good for them but Cory is definately way too good for me.  Anthony told me that they were going on tour sometime and I'm going to die again, probably even worse this time because I know girls love any guy thats in a band.  I know he wouldn't do anything though, I'm confident, I can say that and believe in myself and I love it, this is what I want, this is what I have and am extremely greatful for.  I don't really complain here anymore I say the things I love.  I have what I've always wanted and always been so afraid of, and it doesn't scare me that much anymore.  This is what I'm consumed with, I can't get it out of my mind and I would never want it out of my mind.  I love this and I love him, Cory, I love Cory."

I probably still a bit too emo thought because I am sitting right next to his letter and a picture of him and I.

"event","So, it's midnight ... thats about it.  Well I guess this means that I have another day to sit and wonder if he is going to call me, you want to know what is truely sad? I'm counting the minutes until thursday, when he gets home.  I couldn't sleep last night so I decided to figure it out.  This is extremely pathetic, he's probably out having a good time and I'm sitting here with my life stopped because he's gone.  I'm constantly thinking about him but he's probably got alot more on his mind then me.  Danielle was talking to me today and she said that he would never do anything to hurt me and she knows the whole story too so I guess that made me feel a bit better.  I just really want to hear him since I know I can't see him.  I just realized I rarely ever address him in these little rants, Cory, there I guess I feel acomplished.  Hey, today we have been together for a month, a fucking month and he's got me like this already.  I never have them this way, why do they get me this way?  Am I just a clingey little bitch or something?  I don't ever want him to leave me, we've had a month together and it seems like forever.  It feels like we're old friends, this just feels right to me.  Maybe I'm crazy.  Every time he says he loves me I cry like someone just died, I don't even know why.  It's what I want and I thought I had it before but I mean he makes it so powerful and overwhelming, I want it that way.  Him sayng that he loves me has the power to literally knock me off my feet, is this what love really is?  I don't want this to ever go away, I want him forever, Cory, I want Cory forever.  If you ever end up reading this you can probably guess that I'm crying and a bit hysterical but I love you and I want this to last.  I want this forever, please let me keep it."

"event","So the one thing I have to look forward to each day that he is gone is his call right?  Well I didn't get a call yesterday and something is telling me I'm not going to be getting one today either.  I know it shouldn't be a big deal but it means so much to me, I just want to hear his voice, know how he's going, I don't know jsut some kind of fucking contact.  Well I'm sick as a dog and I don't seem to be getting any better, I confronted my mother after five years of planning to do so, I have alot of shit going on.  I haven't talked to anyone about anyone of this and I want to talk to Cory, I need that, please give me that.  Why the fuck am I asking nothing to give me something?! I just want it and I can't have it, please, if anyone is there get me something.  I don't want the fucking medication I want a person, I want something living and breathing with a personality, I want something that can give a fuck, I don't want a drug.  Even if they were to give me the drug how is that going to make this go away?  I mean I'm not going to magically imagine someone or something is there, I really have no clue what I'm doing right now, I'm not thinking about what I'm writing and I never do that.  I need him, I swore I wouldn't rely on another guy ever again because it fucks me up, thats why I'm here isn't it, thats why I do this, that's why I've been crying myself to sleep.  My scars, my ""depression"" if thats what you want to call it, half of the descisions I've ever made, it's because I put my life in the hands of anyone who says they love me.  Everyone has told me not to do this but I do and I can't stop, something tells me that if I could I probably wouldn't either.  Everytime I look at the clock I think of what time it is where he is and if he is thinking of me, if he is thinking of someone else, if this is going to still go on when he gets back.  I mean maybe he gets back and doesn't give a fuck about me anymore, it wouldn't be the first time something like this happened.  The only thing I keep thinking is he said he wouldn't, he said he couldn't, he said he loved and that nothing else mattered, but fuck, we're young it's doesn't really matter in the long run does it?  He said something about if he were to marry me, is this just part of a plan or something?  Who the fuck would be sick enough to do that?  I mean the rest of them all said the same things as him and they hurt me, whats really the difference with him?  It makes me sick to think that but what the hell am I supposed to think?  What gives me the right to say ""Well they all did the same and said the same things, but theres no chance he could do that to me right?  I mean he said he wouldn't.""  I'll never be able to leave him even if he hurt me, and the worst thing is I told him that, that was pretty fucking smart now wasn't it?  I mean thats just an invitation to do something I mean it's like giving someone a gun and saying ""If you shoot someone I'll be extremely disappointed in you, but I won't punish you.  So go have some fun!""  All my friends actually approve of him, James even likes him and told me that nothing would happen when he was gone but I don't know.  James doesn't approve of anyone I'm with, and Smalls said he was a good guy to, last guy I went out with Smalls wanted to kill for no apparent reason.  Maybe I should just stop this, try and calm down until I can talk to him again.  Anyone who reas this probably thinks I'm a crazy woman on a rampage and wouldn't be suprised if I went and killed all of my ex's after this, on that thought I think I'm done.  If I get a call today I will probably just cry the whole time so I don't see the point in trying to get anything through to him.  I love you, please be there, you know I've given you the ability to but please don't hurt me.  I love you"

"event","So I'm here, again, but it was semi planned this time.  As you know I'm always back here because of a boy (pathetic) once again this holds true.  This time I'm not depressed because I lost them or they cheated on me or any of that bullshit.  I'm in love, I swear this has to be it.  Well this kid he came here from Atlanta so thats where all his family is, and where he is for the moment.  He will be there for eight days and thats how long I plan on using this but I most likely will use it an excess amount during these eight days.  But I guess thats the prelude to the silence.  I have been doing extremely well and hope the same has gone for all of you, whoever may read this.  One of the things I'm baffled about is the fact that I'm now suffering from insomnia, which can never be a good thing.  I do have a neurologist appointment today, which most likely isn't a good thing but you take what you get right?  As long as I'm not dying I'm still doing good, right?  I have no clue how but Cory has somehow made me see the error in my ways without doing a thing to point them out.  Well I think I'm going to be off now, I don't really have much on my mind right now other than what I have to do today.  Thank you all for caring I love you all so much you will never know."

#1 my mom is a wanna be jesus freak. #2 I love Reggie and the full effect bitches.  #3 that was the third time I accidentally typed #1.  #4 Remind me not to try to pierce my own naval.
Alrighty kid os dont want to give you too much super awesome advice, you know I dont wan tyour heads to explode or anything.  I finally have been finding my mangas that I've been looking for, oh yeah bitches.  Advice from Heather: add bitches to the end of a sentence if you want people to take you seriously. I got the new Reggie disc and it is GARGANTUANLY GROOD, I mean good. and great.  Great and good.  I have been having a good break, met Buddy from Senses fail, died, came back to life and wondered what the hell had  happened (yeah that really happened *looks around* no more bunnies!!).  So, I thought i had alot to type but i guess i dont, I could talk about me and Vito, would that be interesting *sees no nods of approval* alright we'll talk about that.  I guess today we kind of had a fight, mostly him telling me the shit I do wrong or something to that or a lesser extent (on a side note I think my finger is bleeding).  So we argued for awhile and as always it ended fine, but a little different than most other fights i have with boyfriends.  He say something that said I loved him and it was way before he ever said he loved me and he asked me if I meant it.  I dont know why people think i joke about that shit because i dont.  Even when i walk around and tell m friends that I love them, I really do but I dont think many people take that incredibly serious.  Everyone knows that I'm the person to come to with problems and shit but I dont know if they get that I really love them all.  I hope they do but anyway we are talking about Vito.  He's such a good kid but I feel like I make him mad sometimes but I dont know.  It's good knowing that he's there but it's hard not seeing him, I mean there is this kid at DNA that keeps hitting on me and wont stop and shit and it would be so much easier if Vito was there because he wouldnt hit on me in front of him.  I think that is about it, I all of a sudden dont feel incredibly talkative ... Love lots <3 Katie"

"event","Hey ho kid oes 
I hope everyone who reads this (mind you thats no one) is in good health and spirits.  It is a little weird to keep seing this thing pop up in my life occasionally but it usually isnt as horrible as some things that are reacurant in life.  Well, seing as how this is my journal I should write about how I am, shouldn't I?  Let's see ... I went out with Nathan for almost 2 1/2 months, he cheated on me twice (no I didnt cheat on him at all, thank you very much) and things got pretty shitty.  The weekend I broke up with Nathan I tried suicide three times I think (mind you this is before I ever broke up with him) I took probably over twenty of some random pain killer, lost about ten pounds in twenty four hours and gained a nasty scar on my wrist.  So needless to say, things were going a little downhill.  Around a week or so later I get a new boyfriend because thats just how I work.  He's a good kid, his name is Vito, yes he is one of Nathan friends, and yes he is Haliegh's(the girl Nathan cheated on me with [she's such a good kid, I love her to death]) ex boyfriend.  By now your all probably saying ""wow you've set this one up to get fucked in the ass real good Katie"" but I dont give a fuck.  No one approves of me being with Vito but Im doing it anyway, that's how I know that this is more right than anything else I could have done.  Yeah I could have gone out with someone else, yeah I could have stayed single for a while remembering how that felt, I could have yelled ""fuck my ass"" and became a whore and gotten more ass than half my friends could ever dream of but I didnt.  I love Vito, and I know that I shouldnt say that because your not suposed to love so many people in such a short ammount of time but I move fast, I adjust, I give people the real me.  I have been thinking and I realized one of my biggest faults is that when Im friends with someone I give them true emotions, I give them my all, everyone one of my friends owns a little piece of my soul and I want them to know that because I love every last one of them.  I would give my life to save any one of my good friends, I stop anything that Im doing to help a friend and Im proud of that.  I want to be the person that when something goes wrong Im always available to get someone through.  It's hard to be the person trying to save everyone but I try to no matter whats going on in my life.  I carry some burdens with me for what I do and I get worn out easily.  So many times Ive found myself sitting there saying ""I just want to live like everyone else, I want to be a kid, I want to not worry about everyone and everything"".  It would be so easy yet so hard to do that, either way I never would.  Ive had numerous friends tell me that they wouldnt know what to do if I wasnt around, people who tell me that I can make them happy, Ive seen friends laugh while they're still crying because I was doing something stupid for that purpose only.  I wouldn't change what I had for the world, so often I say I hate drama and that I wish I wasnt always the person there to help people but I love doing what I do.  I was in a bad mood when I started this but Im so happy right now, if anyone reads this I love you all so much and hope that I can always be there to help, and as logn as I am here Im always willing to drop anything to help you. I love you all to death thanks for being so great."

"event","As always I didn't expect to see this thing ever again but somethings wrong and I don't even know what it is, and no I didn't break up with another boyfriend.  I'm not sure why but theres some deep feeling inside of me screaming, I don't know what or even why they're screaming I just hear it.  Some gut instinct is telling me something went horribly wrong but it wont tell me what it is that went wrong and I'm too stupid to figure it out.  I want to be happy, part of me is still telling myself that I am happy, and I should be.  I don't have one fucking reason to be unhappy right now (that I know of).  I hate instincts or conscience or whatever the fuck is making me feel so uncertain and unhappy.  I think it's the change again, I think this is how I felt when it happened the first time, it's so  goddamn painful, physically and mentally painful.  I think this is my conscience telling me to change again, it doesn't like the road we're taking now and it wants to just drive off into uncharted territory again.  This was always so hard to do, and the begining and the end are always the most painful parts.  I don't know what to do, I was pretty content with the way my personalities went this time (that was an intentional plural).  Maybe today was just an off day or something, maybe I just own an off life.  I realized awhile ago the old Katie has been making some occasional reappearances, just here and there, checking up on things I guess.  I keep telling Nathan that he is exactely like the old Katie and I think he would perfer her over me even though hes never met her.  He keeps telling me that I lie to myself too often and that I just pretend my life is good but I actually beileved it me life was good, my life IS good.  I think I am content with my life at the moment, whether my conscience is or not I could give a fuck less, but I'm content.  I want to be this stage of Katie for as long as this world will let me, even though my personalities are almost complete opposites, actually I think thats funny so I dont care.  I have a good personality and a bad one and i think thats the way it should be.

I've been without my natural color for a very very long time and it was kind of nice having a little bit of it in there, but new year means new hair so it must be done.

"event","So I've brightened up quite a bit since last entry but I also realized that being cheated on leaves you emotionally broken.  When I was with Logan he said he would never cheat on me and i believed him, I never thought I had the slightest thing to worry about.  After you go through those feelings and then find out that you were wrong you become permanently paranoid, or at least I did.  It hurts so much to think that I'm damaged and it's Logans fault.  Nathan promised he'd never do that to me and I believe him, but then again I believed Logan and I thought he cared about me too and after this one experience every relationship becomes damaged.  I hate to sound vain or anything but I was so mad because the girl Logan cheated on me with is ugly and annoying.  When we first got together everyone said thtat I was too good for him and I guess only now do I realize that I really am.  I don't mean that as I'm too pretty for him or that kind of stupid shit, but I mean it as in he's a dick and I really didn't need that in the long run.  After thinking everything through it makes my life make a whole lot more sense right now but it doesn't make situations any better.  The only thing I know is that Nathan can make me feel like no one has ever been able to, in a good way.  I think that's all that is really on my mind right now, but I will leave you with this last thought, you can't really say you know someone until they've deflowered your belly botton.

"event","Ok, so I didnt think I'd be back here again but the world has eaten my life and shit me out a new one to deal with.  I started Johansen it was going well, I started dating the principals son, he cheated on me, I didn't find that out until i had cheated on him and broken up with him.  The day I broke up with him the guy i cheated on him with asked me out and i said yes because, fuck it, I dont know why I just did.  Two days into the relationship he told me he loved me and told me not to say it back unless I really meant it, I said it.  He is such a great guy and everything feels right when I'm around him, he is the most emo fuck I've ever met, but in a good way.  The only thing is, he is obsessed with his ex girlfriend, or he was.  I think that by being cheated on, I became a jealous girlfriend and I dont want him or anyone else to know that.  I hate the saying that the one person that you give the right to make you cry wont ever use it, because thats bullshit.  That person might never intentionally use it but damn, in my life those people have always made me cry harder than anyone else but they did it without knowing.  Maybe I've just had a shitty week or maybe I'm going crazy, maybe I'm developing a mental disorder, maybe i should just eat my own ass and stop whinning right now i dont have a clue.  I just really want to be with Nathan and I can't, I would rather eat my own hand then be alone right now, I shouldn't be alone right now. I feel like an idiot for coming back here but this just feels good, well, better than nothing.  I need Nathan."

"event","alright, so maybe I haven't updated in probably a month, but maybe I haven't done anything in a month, ok so that was a lie but ... shut up i dont care.
      So we'll backtrack from today, my fourteenth birthday, I'm sick as a dog, have no voice, am acting like there's nothing wrong with me, yet still had a pretty nice day.  I woke up at around ten and at eleven dominique called me and asked when we were going to the movies and i tols her i didnt know she hung up, without telling me happy birthday, I wasnt even sour about it either so I knew it was going to be a good day.  Soon after hanging up with dominique Thomas called me, told me happy birthday, and let me know what movie he could make. While I was still on the phone with Thomas, Laura called me, told me happy birthday and let me know she wouldnt make the movie. After I got off the phone with both of them I had a muffin and called Dominique and told her what time the movie was.  I then called Zack and proceeded to tell him about how i lost my pants (on a side note I still have not found my pants) and our conversation ended with him getting pissed off about our friendship and telling me he had to go do chores. So I did nothing the rest of the day other than go to the movies which was pretty fun no one really showed up but that was cool with me. I only describe this in such detail because i know that this is the only time i will remember it in such detail and I only turn fourteen once right?
      So we're back tracking, Yesterday wasnt anything I just went to the store and bought a couple cds and after dropping Dominique and Laura off at there houses i just did nothing the rest of the day.  Friday, that's a complete different story.  So I woke up at 4 in the fucking morning because i was sick, sick, I was going to be sick for my birthday, great.  So it was around five thirty and i had an alk song stuck in my head so I grabbed my portable and threw goddamnit in and just listened to the whole cd.  While I was listneing to it I didn't feel at all sick, so has brought me to the conclusion that alkaline trio are not human but some unknown creature with the ability to create music with healing powers.  At around six I got up to clean the house did that, chilled for about an hour afterward, showered, then burnt cds for a million people.  At twelve thirty my mom came home so we could go get Laura and Dominique and then we got taco bell and at one spencer showed up we just were hangin out in my kitchen and then at around one thirty josh showed up little bit later tommy showed up, and then Laura insisted upon calling Zack and while on the phone with Zack she told him that he had to come over so my mom went with Dominique to go pick him up. we all really didnt do anything incredible or entertaining the whole day but we watched scary movie 2 and Zack locked me out of my room and proceeded to go through my drawers, we had cake, and after spencer left we watched bad santa and i broke Zack's Skiba glasses.
       I can't even remember what else I didn't this week other than Round up which I thought  was pretty fun but apparently no one else did I think I was just happy to get out of the house.  We didn,t do much at round up but we played some stupid games, foma stole my phone and i saw a hot guy who's ass's name was todd, good times
       I think that this week went really really well and life has been looking up for me.  I think that I have been continuously happy all week long and I also believe that this is my first post without a complaint in it, maybe fourteen is going to be the start of something new and exciting, something great with many opportunities, a chance to start brand new for the third time, or maybe I've just become more optimistic.  I have high hopes for my new school, and maybe a new attitude, if this is what i am than I am proud because this is what I want to be I want to be happy and settled, yet different and experimenting, but if this isn't how I stay, I'll just keep trying and as long as I get days like this every once in a while I'll keep trying. So I think I may just turn over a new leaf and if I do I'll be sure to keep this updated as much as possible.

I've been sleeping like 11 hours and then i only got 6 or 7 hours all together, I'm going to die when i have to go to Ozzfest.  No one ever calls me or invites me to go and do anything, I guess I'm not very liked, oh well, I like myself, wait no I don't, guess I'm screwed then.  I want to go to Warped tour again and I don't want Zack to be mad at me anymore, I want alot of random crap that I'm not going to get.  I complain too much, I should stop complaining, most likely not going to but I should try it and see how it works out for me.

I had alot of fun and I barely got sun burnt at all so this year was better than the last, fuck all of you who said that this years warped was going to suck.  We got to meet Gerard from My Chemical Romance, who were awesome live and are now one of my favorite bands and I'm currently addicted to their new cd.  We also met alkaline trio and I still haven't found out what kind of shoes Derek was wearing but they were really awesome and I want some.  I almost threw up 4 times that day and barely ate anything that whole day and then the next day i was 5 pounds lighter, I'm slightly overweight anyway so it's not like it hurt anything.  I loved Matt Skiba's tye!!! It was so awesome!!! We'll yesterday I went to the movie's with Spencer and we saw anchorman which was very stupid but it was funny anyway.  It's 5 in the afternoon and I haven't taken a shower yet, I'm so lazy it's not even funny, wait ... yeah it is funny.  I'm excited for Ozzfest and begging my parents to let me go see MCR in San Fransisco in september, what possess them to go there on a monday and tuesday?  I want to see Alk again sometime soon, maybe Spencer will even go so I wont have to give him my pictures.  I was seriously going to end this post about 5 sentances ago.

I went to Thomas's party at twelve we left at around six and we all went to the movies(realize I hadn't eaten anything all day and now I decided I need to go to the movies).  My brother was already there with his girlfriend and when the movie got out one of his friends came up to me and asked me if I knew where he was at and I said I didnt even know if he was even still there.  So I was constantly calling my brother while the people I came with were all running away or being taken away or complaining about how they were all hungry.  So I found my brother and started screaming at him about how he wasnt answering his phone and all this other stuff that was just coming out of my mouth that I cant even remember right now.  I finally just walked away and was by myself just walkng in circles while my brothers friend came up behind me and grabbed my butt and my only response was "" that was my butt"" and he said yes it was and started laughing and walked away.  I need to call Zack Tommy Thomas and Josh and apologize for yesterday, my head hurts so bad.

I doubt I'll be able to update for a while again because next week is the last week of school and you can imagine that I have many things to do after school.  I finally picked up Love Metal I had never been able to find it before, the thing cost me 25 fucking dollars, there are only 10 songs on the cd!!  I almost didnt buy it but I didnt know if I would ever see it again.  I also got the Revolution on Canvas book I've been looking for for a couple of months and Laura read one of the poems and started yelling that I had been reading porn, I got a couple of weird looks even though I was yelling just as loud as she was that it was not porn.  My wrist is killing me it keeps rubbing against the thing as i type.  Why must I hurt myself while I sleep, if, in fact, that is what I'm doing.  A couple of times I'm almost positive that I was hurting myself unconciously but you know.  I have no clue why but Kevin(this guy I didnt know that kept following me and telling me that he loved me and trying to touch me at the beginning of the year) keeps happening to be in some of my conversations, everyone always tells me that they see him in the office of our school and today Shane told me that he had gotten much fatter but I dont know.  Me and Shane were talking about the stuff he was doing at the beginning of the year and I asked him if he was just messing with me and Shane told me that he was pretty sure that Kevin actually liked me, stalker kind of liking.  This has just been a very weird week and tomorrow I'm going to the first funeral I've ever been allowed to go to, wish me luck.

As soon as we left the theatre Spencer and Josh both left and I was left standing outside the theatres alone for a couple of minutes.  This is off topic but I saw that post you made Laura and I thought you were over that by now you know that I didnt mean that your constantly annoying just that I dont want one friend's feeling to affect my relationship with another friend but whatever man its not like you havent said things about me or told things that you swore to me that you wouldnt tell people.  I think we should just be mature and put this in the past.  Anyways, Zack called me at 10:13 last night and i was actually sleeping but i talked to him for around an hour anyway.  I can't stop thinking about that, I apologized so many times to you Laura yet you still can't put it behind you, your lying to yourself if you say that there weren't time that you thought i was really annoying and never told me to my face so ...

"event","Here's a question for the wise: What is it that your suposed to do when the one person you care about and you know cares about you stops caring? Yes, that was very confusing but hear me out.  A person you can stay up until three in the morning talking to and you would rather fall asleep with them talking to you than to tell them that you would rather sleep than hear them speak.  a person that you tell secrets to that you told yourself you didn't want anyone to know.  A person that sits there and tries to convince you that your loved without actually saying that <i>they</i> love you because they were afriad it would make you feel akward.  A person that actually cared enough to say they loved you when you really needed to hear it, and even though you didn't want to say it back you know,as well as them, that you loved them too.  Then, all of a sudden it just seemed to end, no particular reason, it just stops.  The person that used to call you every night goes what seems like a month without calling you (it most likely seemed longer than it actually was).   That person just, stoped taking interest in your life.  Once in a while you still get a phone call but the conversations that used to be interesting and meaningful are now boring.  What do you do when you love that person too much to tell them that you want everything to be like before, you want everything to go back to normal, but you can't, you dont want to hurt that person.  By now if your reading this you know whether its you or not, and if you haven't figured it out then i guess there really isnt any hope for this to go back to normal, if you do realize it's you (I'm not saying it's everyone reading this, this is to a specific person, only one person) I love you, and I mean it, ok? thanks

Monday I got taken out of school early, the only good thing that happened that day, and i got brakets put on my molars, wasn't too pleasant.  Tuesday my mouth hurt like hell and we had to test put Christian calling me fat on top of all of that, doesn't add up to the most fun day ever.  Yesterday me and Laura spent like 6 hours working on our project, we finished, thank god.  Today Christian was just being a dick face again so after school I tried to talk to him and be serious and not yell just civilized conversation, against two total oppisites and enemies.  Well the conversation didn't have any yelling but I don't think I got through to him, so all and all I have to say it went better than expected.  The only good part of this week is Darrin tabbed out God Called In Sick Today for me.  I have a killer headache, I will leave you on this Spencer thought Atreyu was emo and Coheed and Cambria was metal, that always makes me laugh, sorry if I affended anyone ... because there are really people who read this.

"event","I just realized how ...  unique my relationship with spencer is, which just makes me feel horrible for him that he has to be my friend.  I really just tell him everything and i think thats very odd how i go from being afraid to talk to guys to telling a guy everything in a very short period of time.  I think I'm just now realizing that I have matured since last year, you never think about maturing and that crap unless you think about how you used to act compaired to how you act now and not many people do that very often.  My parents always said that I was too mature for my age but I think that is because they dont want to except that I'm not in the first grade still and that I actually am a person with feelings.  Whatever is going on its not anyhting I care very much about I just want to do what I have to and try to get rid of all the useless stressful crap, which isnt likely to happen but I can hope can't I?

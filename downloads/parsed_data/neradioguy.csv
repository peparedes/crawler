"event","...and what a year it has been. Ok, so this is a pretty common thing to do this time of year, so I'll do a little reflecting.

If you had talked to me on December 31st of 2003, I would have never guessed that December 31st of 2004 would be so completely different. My life has changed so much in 364 1/4 days, it's impossible to describe. New job, new home, new friends, there is virtually nothing about my life now that is the same as it was a year ago. I'm a lot happier, that's for sure. I'm ""in a better place"" in many ways. I have a great job, I'm dating an incredible person, I really like my home...and, let's face it, I have a damn slot machine! 

It did kind of suck sitting at home, alone at 12:48am on 1/1/05. Although I was on stage in front of a few thousand people as we were all counting down to midnight...but nowhere to go but home after that. But, then again, I'd rather be sitting home with my thoughts, reflecting, then being all phony and pretending to have a good time with people I barely know and may not even care for. Of course it would be different if I was with real friends...but all of them were either gone or busy last night. Oh well, maybe next year.

Anyway, I'm excited about 2005. A ton of opportunities, possibilities, and new doors to open. 

Happy New Year!"

Although, as I said, ""C"" is away for 4 months now, and I definitely miss him more now that I'm home. We had a great, 3 hour conversation last night. And it wasn't one of those lovey-dovey ""I miss you"" ""no, I miss YOU' ""well I miss YOU MORE"" things. We talked a lot about reality, what we can expect, our fears, etc. 4 months from now will we still be a couple? Impossible to say, but I hope so. We'll have to wait and see. In the mean time I'm kind of in limbo as far as my free time goes. We always spent weekends together, so I really don't know what to do with myself now. Suppose I'll have to go and make *gasp* friends or something.

Anyway, I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately. But I'm debating if I should call the doctor or not. There's really only one option left and I don't like it. So I've kind of got it in my head that I'll give it ONE MORE night, if I sleep well I'll let it go...if not, I'll call. But then, of course, it all starts again every morning.

It's going to be tough having ""C"" so far away for so long. He's studying abroad for the semester and will be gone until mid April. So he's going home on Friday to move out of school and be with his family for the holidays. Then, after the New Year, he heads overseas. Thankfully we have modern technology so we'll be able to chat often. But, of course, it's not nearly the same as being with someone. We've known each other for about 4 months now, and we've been going out for about a month and a half. So we're still at the beginning of things. I really hope it can last through the semester away though. I think he's a great guy and I'm anxious to see what kind of long term possibility we have together. I don't feel like it now, but one of these days I'll explain all the things I like about him. So I just gotta enjoy these next few days and be supportive. It's a great opportunity for him to study abroad and he'll have amazing experiences. So I just have to be supportive and try to make it through these next 4 months.

<B>Geek Speak Alert!!</B> In other news, I stayed up way too late last night trying to get my TiVo hooked up through my home network. I bought a wireless USB adapter for a really good price through eBay. Got everything plugged in. TiVo was showing my network and it had a signal, but I couldn't connect to the TiVo service. And I couldn't figure out why. I tried a kabillion combinations and still couldn't get it to work. It was driving me nuts. I did a ton of research on message boards, etc online and couldn't find an answer. So I went up and took a shower. After I figured I'd give it one last shot. Went back to a message board and found a posting from someone who sounded like they were having the same problem. Basically, all I had to do all along was enter my network password in hexidecimal format instead of alphanumeric. And it worked right away. Why is it that the most frustrating problems always have the simplest solutions?"

"event","So I had an...interesting weekend. Started out with my party on Friday. The first time I ever hosted a party. I think it went well. I haven't talked to anyone yet, but it looked like everyone had a good time. I was glad everyone showed up (except my friend from back where I grew up. But I kind of expected that). Now here's the funny part...I definitely drank too much! I had a beer in my hand all night long. I honestly can't say how much I drank. I did a little mixing which was probably pretty stupid. I had previously gotten sick from drinking once in my life. Don't get me wrong, I've done plenty of drinking in my time, I guess I just have a good tolerance and I'm don't over do it. But yeah, I definitely got sick. Thankfully AFTER everyone left! And I was pretty much a lost cause for most of Saturday. Up until about 7pm I had eaten a muffin all day long.

But I had plans to go out with cousins. I have one who lives nearby and we hadn't gotten together since I had been here, and another was in town to visit. Honestly, if it wasn't family, I would have cancelled, I felt that crappy. Heh, I stayed in my pajamas till I had to shower to get ready to leave at 5. And yeah, I definitely drank water all night! But it was nice to hang out with my cousins. ""C"" came along as well and he enjoyed hanging out. My cousins also said he seems like a really nice guy. 

Sunday was more or less a bum around day. ""C"" and I were both pretty exhausted from the bulk of the weekend, and he had some school work to do. We ran out for lunch and so I could do some grocery shopping. But other then that just bummed around the house all day. But, then again, sometimes that's the best way to spend a Sunday!

So, like I said, an interesting weekend. How were your weekends? Good I hope."

I left some stuff here though because she has a nice big basement and there was some old stuff I wasn't going to need right away. I wanted to go through some of the stuff though and see if there was anything I wanted right away. Now I have to say, I'm a pack rat...I save EVERYTHING. Everything that I think is cool, might have some meaning someday, I like the font on, etc. I have my old backpack from school stuffed full of junk (anyone want some old Ritalin? God I could make a killing with that stuff at the local colleges). So I rummaged through it for fun and came across something pretty cool; the music log from my very first professional on-air shift. This was two days ago, the date on the music log, ""11/28/99"". Weird huh? So today is the 5 year anniversary of the start of my professional radio career. And I didn't even realize it. Maybe I'll get a cupcake and stick a candle in it. 

And how 'bout this: I was going to call my answering machine to see if the doc's office called on Friday...yeah, I definitely forgot my remote access code. So I'm gonna have 3 or 4 messages of me pushing buttons and cursing in the background.

So I'm planning to head back home early this afternoon. It's not THAT long of a drive. But the weather is kind of crappy now. Which figures. It was nice almost every day...except the day I left home, and now the day I'm leaving here. Call me paranoid if you want, but I'm starting to believe the whole ""greater conspiracy against me"" thing."

"event","Here's my list of what I have to be Thankful for this year:

I'm thankful that I'm not a cheeseball who writes a whole journal entry about what I'm thankful for.

It's been nice being back ""home"" for Thanksgiving. (I put home in quotes because this is where I grew up, not where I live. Also, the house I grew up in isn't in the family anymore, so I can't even visit my childhood home and get all nostalgic. Oh well). This is the first time in 4 or 5 years that I've been able to be with my family for Thanksgiving. So it's nice to be able to be here. Everyone seems all concerned about the medical thing which is kind of strange. But I guess the attention is nice. I just don't want to make a big deal out of it though. I honestly don't think it's anything life threatening, so when the doc calls and says I'm simply allergic to Spaghetti-Os, people aren't let down that it wasn't something more. It's gotten a little worse the last day or two though which is driving me nuts. I'm actually gonna call my answering machine back home later today to see if there's any chance they called with the results. They said, normally, they should be in by the end of the week. But, because of the holiday, it might take longer. Couldn't hurt to check though. I just want answers and a course of treatment man.

Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving. And I am thankful for friends, old and new. So there, there's some cheese for ya, happy?"

I'm scared.

I have some strange condition going on here. The doctor gave me a perscription to see if it would clear it up, and we'd go from there. It did...and it didn't. Cleared up some stuff, not others. So I went back in today. The doc wanted to do a biopsy. I don't do well with needles, blades, etc. So that was a pretty unpleasant experience. 

Although I have to say, the anticipation was worse the procedure itself. The novocaine needle was the worst part. I really didn't feel the rest. Although now the novocaine has worn off. And it hurts like hell. If someone cuts a hole in ya...it's gonna hurt.

So now we wait. I'll find out what they found in about a week.

"event","I know I don't update on as regular a basis as some people do, but in the upcoming weeks I'll probably be doing a lot of reflecting and updating. You see, next month is the 1 year anniversary of getting let go from my last job. Also, looking back at my journal, I realized that I never really told the whole story of what got me where I am now. Here's the short version, I might write the long version some time. Or I might not, we'll see.

Basically, I was living in New England and had a full time on-air job. I was in a long term relationship, but I was somewhat unhappy in general. I had been at my job for about 2 1/2 years and I had been casually looking around for other jobs for about a year. I say ""casually"" because I was just sending out demos and resumes here and there, when I saw stuff that sounded interesting. I had a few good interviews, but never made it to the point of getting a solid offer. I was unhappy with my job because my on-air time kept getting cut back to work on other, off the air, stuff, and my boss wasn't the greatest. Far from it in fact. 

I had been with my partner since Summer of 99. I said from the very beginning what it means to go out with a radio person. I'll get fired, I'll get offered new jobs, etc. He was on board. 

The big thing, about looking for a new job...I wanted to quit before getting let go. Well they got to me first. December of last year, my position was eliminated. My shift would no longer be a live shift, it would be ""voice tracked"" from out of the market. (Any guesses on the company anyone?). So I couldn't take it personally, but it didn't make it suck any less.

I immediately got a part time on-air job at a place I had worked at earlier in my career which was great. Awesome place, great people. No full time openings, but it was great to be able to stay on the air while I embarked on my search for a new f/t gig. 

Then it got sticky. The lease at our apartment was ending. Since I was actively looking for a new job, I didn't think it would make much sense to renew the lease. Of course, it would have been great to find a new job before the lease was up, but when does life ever work out like that? 

The time came, the lease was up. I was getting ready to move back in with Mom. The day before packing the truck, I got a phone call from someone interested in interviewing me. In the mean time, in preparation for moving back in with my mother, I had a part time gig set up there. 

Moved back to the area I grew up in. Worked there for a few weeks. Got an offer pretty quickly. Moved to where I am now. My partner wanted to stay in New England. We broke up. 

But I'm here now and, almost a year later, things are looking good. I'm really happy at my job. I love my home. I'm seeing an awesome guy. It's amazing how much things can change in one year.

Here's the set up: I'm doing my shift, the co-worker is at home. I stay online on instant messenger so I can talk to the traffic people. I do a break...co-worker IMs me:

<i>PsychoCoWorker04: WHOA! Slow down there turbo! ""comingupthenewonefromU2anddetailsonthebigcontest!""

<i>PsychoCoWorker04: Sheesh!!</i>

</i>No joke, I was so pissed, out loud I yelled ""FUCK YOU!!"". And signed off (traffic was done for the day anyway). Guess what whack job, you're not my boss, you're not a consultant, you're not even giving me a constructive critique, you're just being nasty. You're trying to accomplish what exactly? And then yesterday I was taking calls about an incident that happened to me over the weekend. Really good, interactive stuff, followed by the traffic report. Psycho co-worker walks into the studio, ""Jeez, that was the longest break I've EVER hear! Man!"". 

Now I like to keep a pleasant working environment so I just ignored the comment all together. But much more of this, and it'll start to get unpleasant.  Guess what honey, I don't need your advice, that's what I have friends in bigger markets for. And besides, considering I don't exactly admire your on-air style and I don't plan to model myself after you, keep it to yourself. Ho.

But, if you want to work for someone some day, who better to critique you now?

One of my co-workers is close to psycho. Always complaining. Bad attitude. I hope other people see it and not just me. But, of course, the big smile showed up when the big wigs showed up (not to mention my co-worker's nose so far up the programmer's ass that it made fisting look tame). Bizarre.

We might not all agree whether the outcome is a good thing or a bad thing, but I think most of us can agree on one thing, this system needs to be fixed.

Also, talking about voting, it's a proud day in America! 11 states now have government sanctioned discrimination. 11 states have approved constitutional amendments outlawing same sex marriage. Now hang on, let's leave the moral and religious debates for another day. Here's my problem, aren't constitutions meant to protect our rights, not limit them?

In other news, my mother visited again this past weekend. We have fun hanging out. We have a cool relationship, she's my mother and my friend. And all my friends here (ok, BOTH my friends here, happy?) think she's cool, so that's gotta count for something.

My boss is on vacation this week. Don't get me wrong, I like my boss...but there's just something about not having that authority figure around for a few days that's relaxing. Should be a good week. 

I MUST get to work on a new demo. Not for a new job or anything, just to send out to my contacts. Keep in touch, up to date, etc. I've been putting it off and I HAVE to get something done. I've been here for almost 6 months now and I need to have something representative of my work here.

<B>Observation of the day:</B> Tomorrow is Nov 2nd. NOBODY knows what's going to happen. I honestly believe that today is the last day of America as we know it. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing remains to be seen."

I don't understand how people can still be undecided. The two major candidates are so different. I also don't understand how the race is still so close. In my opinion, one is glaringly incompetent. But that's just my opinion. Things are gonna get interesting in a week.

I'm watching ""The Swan"". Makes me sick, ""with enough surgery, you too can be happy, successful, and loved"". Whatever happened to accepting the hand that was dealt to you and making the most of it?

"event","Being back in New England for the weekend was interesting. The couple times I've been back, it's always been...disorienting. It's strange to be back in the places that are so familiar, but I feel like I no longer belong there. It's nice to see places I recognize, but strange at the same time. 

The wedding was nice.

The talk with the ex was interesting. It looks like we finally came to a conclusion. 

This is it.

It's over.

He finally came right out and said, ""I'll never move away from my family."" It's good to know I suppose because it means that there's no wondering anymore. No ""what ifs"" for the future. Sure it's disappointing and a little hurtful, but it means I can move on. 

I wasn't expecting it to end like this. From the very beginning I told him what it means to be in a relationship with someone in broadcasting. I'll get let go. I'll get new offers. It's not always going to be in the same neighborhood. So it can't be said that I was being dishonest or that this move came out of nowhere. We had talked about it. I was fully under the impression that he would be able to handle it. 

I'm not bitter or mad. Just disappointed.

But again, now I can begin the process of moving on.

Every experience makes me stronger."

"event","Yeah, not quite though. But, as I have said plenty of times, it's great to be socializing. I went out to dinner with ""R"" last night which was nice. He's the one who knows one of my co-workers. We hung out a number of times in the past but he's been kind of aloof lately. So I was starting to think that he wasn't interested anymore. But we had a nice dinner and he was like, ""I'm really sorry about not being in touch lately. It's totally my fault, I have no excuse besides my laziness."" He's the one who I had said, previously, ""you need to make your opinion based on face to face interaction."" And, honestly, we've always had really good f2f interaction, last night included. So that was cool.

So tonight, ""C"" is coming over. As I have said, I really, thoroughly, enjoy spending time with him. 

Now, in my defense, I have to say...I'm not slutting it up. I'm not hanging out with all these guys to try to ""get some"". Been there, done that, got it outta my system. These are definitely people who are interesting, unique, and a ton of fun to hang with. And it's nice that there's no pressure there. There's none of that ""well we're both gay and single so I suppose we should date."" It's great to have friends with such a mature view of what it means to be a young gay man. It doesn't always have to be an episode of ""Queer As Folk"". 

I'm enjoying myself. I'm really glad to have made some really valuable friends.

"event","...I saw 430am? Well, when I was working part time I was doing some overnights, so it's been a couple months. But when was the last time I saw 430am from the OTHER side?? Probably my intern days. 

Y'see, one of our stations had a huge all day music fest this past weekend and we all had to help out. We had to be there at 6am. I live 45 mins away. Do the math and, if I planned to get dressed and eat something before I went, yup, you got 430am. I was NOT looking forward to it at all. Good thing and bad thing that the schedule was out so last minute; I didn't have to dread it for too long, but it was also pretty irritating not being able to make weekend plans in advance. 

But, I have to say, it wasn't THAT bad. Everybody was in the same boat. I would say 80% of the people working there were from other parts of the company (not the sponsoring station), so there was a great comraderie from the shared sense of annoyance. It actually, dare I say, turned out to be kinda fun. The only down side was by that night when I was BEAT. I didn't want to nap because I didn't want to throw off my whole system. But hey, it's over now and it might put me in the overtime category. Can't complain about THAT!

The one part that sucked was that I couldn't go to the surprise party for my dad's birthday. I feel badly that I'm rarely able to go visit. Thankfully they all understand. All the sacrifices I'm making now are with the bigger picture in mind. It'll all be worth it in the future.

Next weekend: over to New England for a wedding. I love weddings. I hate long drives.

"event","I had a really good weekend. 2nd in a row, how bout that :). Like I've said previously, I'm really happy with some of the friends I have been making lately. Early on when I moved here I was meeting a lot of flaky and unintelligent people. I had met some really NICE people...but someone can be the nicest person in the world, if they have no idea what's going on when I start talking about, say politics for example, we're not going to have a heck of a lot in common. I value a worldly knowlegde and intelligence. Nice, fun people are great to go out with...but I also want friends who I can just hang out with over coffee, a movie at home, etc. And, as I started saying, I think I've met a few of those people.

There's the one, whose party I went to last weekend and blew off our plans this past week (see previous entry), who is still a cool guy and I have definitely enjoyed hanging out with...but, as I said in one of my comments, my rose colored glasses are starting to clear up on that one. This is the person who I wondered if I might be interested in on a different level. But, looking at it now, I don't know that we would make that great a couple (I know I'm looking WAY ahead, but isn't it best to look at these things first to get an idea?). He seems to be the type who always has to be doing something. When not working then out with friends. While I am mostly (but not always) a home body. At the end of my work day, I'd much rather sit at home and relax a little as opposed to meeting friends at a bar for a few drinks. And the thing is, he's a really cool guy and I definitely like him. But I have to wonder if jumping in and asking him out might not be a good idea. When there's someone who seems like a really cool friend, but there's not necessarily a lot in common lifestyle-wise, probably best not to cross that line. The last thing I want to do is date someone who I really like, but then learn that we don't have enough in common on a dating level, and that friendship is more or less ruined. And don't give me that BS about ""staying friends"" we ALL know how that goes.

So anyway, I've seriously digressed...my weekend:

I've met two guys who really rock. We'll call 'em...hmm...""M"" and ""C"" just because I don't feel like coming up with clever nicknames right now, maybe next time. I talked about them briefly in last weekend's entry. They're the ones who know each other from school. So Friday I took C out for a drink. He turned 21 over the summer so I had been telling him I'd buy him a drink, so we did that on Friday. We came back and watched ""This is Spinal Tap"" afterwords, then I took him home. Almost lost my car on a flooded street on my way home...but that's a whole other entry! Saturday I went to Starbucks/Barnes & Noble with M in the afternoon. He had to go to his sister's Sat night though so couldn't do anything later. Sat night, C came over again and we rented a movie. I had a bottle of ""99 Banannas"" I had bought sitting out and he said: 

<i>C: </i>""I bet that stuff would be great in a milkshake"" 

<i>Me:</i>""yeah? Wanna go to the grocery store and get some ice cream?"" 

<i>C</i>""seriously? Sure!"". 

So we did, at the grocery store at midnight, not like me, it's fun being spontaneous for once in my life. So we got back and I realized I got frozen yogurt instead of ice cream...but whatever, it tasted good. But I said to him, before we went to get the stuff, ""I have to tell you though, I'm pretty serious when it comes to this, if you're drinking you're staying"" he was just like, ""ok"". So we had a few drinks and we were just shooting the shit a little. I was getting way tired so I said, ""ok, I'm beat, let's figure out what we're doing with you. I have a sofa bed down here and a futon in the spare room upstairs. Personally I would recommend the futon of the two because the sofa bed has a really thin mattress. And, of course, there is the queen sized bed in my room."" What do you want, I was a little drunk...what can it hurt to throw in a half-joke to see what the reaction is gonna be? So then, OF COURSE, the answer was ""whatever's easiest, any of those is fine with me."" So, naturally, we go back and forth a few times, ""well, where would you be more comfortable? Doesn't matter to me"" ""whatever is easiest for you is fine with me"". So I was like, ""why don't you sit on the futon and see how you like it"" So I started getting the sheets and stuff for the futon and he said: 

<i>C</i> ""I just don't want you to have to do too much work"" 

<i>Me</i> ""It's not a lot of work. I just have to unfold it and make it up.""

<i>C</i> ""I just feel badly that you have to make it up, wash the sheets after and everything.""

<i>Me</i> ""It's really not a problem. But hey, if you want to crash in the bed, it's fine with me.""

<i>C</i> ""ok""

So we climbed into the bed. Talked for a little while, and fell asleep. And y'know what? <i>We didn't touch each other once.</i> And that was awesome. It was a good feeling to share my bed with someone who didn't want just one thing from me. It made me respect him in a huge way. So Sunday night both M and C came over and we watched ""Dead Like Me"" on Showtime. That's kind of our Sunday night tradition now. I suggested we make up a drink to have while we watch, build the tradition a little...so any thoughts on what would make a good ""Deadtini""? 

They're both awesome guys. They're both really super sweet, polite, and considerate, which I really value in people...they're both intelligent, and neither of them are real party animals. So these guys definitely seem like two people I can see myself becoming good friends with. I thoroughly enjoy the company of both.

<b>Bitch of the day:</b> Worked the fair again yesterday afternoon. Love it when this happens, ""I liked your station better before it changed format."" And, believe me, they're not friendly about it! Ok, so I'm working, how am I suppsoed to respond to that?? ""Well I liked you better before you showed up at my booth!"""

"event","I hate chasing people. I hate getting ditched. For years I've had the 3 strike rule. 3 ditches and the friendship is over. And I don't think that's too harsh, because, if someone cares about you, they wouldn't ditch you. If anything I think 3 is too lenient

Let me explain my definition of a ditch however: If you make plans with someone and, a little while beforehand they call, ""hey, I'm really sorry but I won't be able to make it"". That's fine. Even if it's a line of BS. Even if they just decided they didn't want to go out or had other plans. At least they had the common courtesy to call. A ditch is making plans with someone in advance, and then them not showing up or not following up. Once someone else has agreed to your suggestion, they should follow up.

<i>Me: </i>""Hey, we should get together again soon.""

<i>Him: </i>""Yeah, definitely! I'm busy tonight, have plans with friends tomorrow night, but let's do something thursday!""

Is it me or does that count as plans? And then I hear nothing after that. And I hate chasing people, ""so hey, we still on for Thurs?"" ""hey, what do you want to do tonight?"". I'm sick of that stuff. I've done it my whole life and it sucks.

I'm sick of doing all the work and I'm not going to anymore. If both parties are interested in the friendship, then it shouldn't always be one person doing all the suggesting and follow up. If it IS that way, then it's not an equal friendship. Why should I spend so much time trying to get the attention of someone who's not as interested in me?

"event","I had a good weekend.

I went to a house warming party on Saturday. It was for a friend of a coworker (the friend, the subject of <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/neradioguy/2004/08/27/"" target=""_blank"">this entry</a>). And ya know what? I had a really good time. I only really knew two people there, the coworker and her friend. I had met some of their other friends in the past, but only once or twice. But I really feel like I'm maturing in my handling of these situations. I didn't feel like I had to follow around the people I knew all night. It was a big party, I wasn't going to be the host's shadow, and my coworker didn't show up till a bit later. But I did just fine dammit! It actually started well. I don't know the area all that well yet, so I followed directions and parked on the street. It was hard to see house numbers though so I just followed the noise. As I got closer someone was like ""someone's coming"" so I'm thinking, ""great, there are bunch of people on the porch, they all saw me and now it's gonna get all quiet and awkward when I walk up"". But, right after, ""someone's coming"" somebody, not a voice I recognized, said, in a smiling way,  ""oh, it's neradioguy"" (come on, humor me). Immediately I felt welcome. It was a great way to enter the situation. And, like I said, I did well. Introduced myself to people I didn't know, played drinking games with new people, it was really an excellent exercise in self confidence. 

And the funniest part is, the ""host,"" the one I could see myself being interested in, got really drunk and passed out in his bed really early. I didn't talk to him much at all that night. But ya know what? I'm ok with that, like I said, I had a good time dammit...his loss! ;)

Went to sleep at about 5am. Had to work Sunday at a county fair. THAT was fun (THAT is also sarcasm).

Sunday evening I got together with another friend who introduced me, in person, to a friend I had been talking to online for a few weeks. Turns out they've been friends at school for a while. And another friend of theirs came along. We all went out to dinner. I got an excellent first impression off of the 1st one, the friend I had spoken to online before, and I definitely look forward to spending time with him again. The other one seemed like a nice enough kid. But just that, a kid. I tend to like hanging out with younger people, but also mature younger people. Seemed like a nice enough guy, but still a little immature. Can't hold it against him, I just don't think he and I would have much to talk about if we hung out again. But it was another really nice evening. 

It makes me feel good to be getting out there, meeting people, making a group of friends, and being accepted into other's groups of friends.

<b>Observation of the day: </b>County fairs are fun but MAN ya gotta be prepared for the stupid questions and answer them in the nicest way possible. 

""Do you work for the radio station?"" 

The acceptable answer is not, ""based on the fact that I am standing in their booth, wearing a polo shirt with their logo on it, AND wearing a laminate with the logo, my name, and the words STAFF on it, do you think you can answer that question for me Cletus?"""

"event","So I hung out with my brother yesterday, it was cool.

See, he lives in a major metro, I live about an hour and a half away in a smaller metro. Where he lives, there is a Major League Baseball team. I love baseball. He couldn't care less. But I think, over the past few years, we've been trying to find a common ground. We fought like cats and dogs as kids, never really saw eye to eye, have completely different interests, etc. We still don't have a heck of a lot in common. Our interests are completely different. And he's a little...well, ""weird"". 

I gotta give the guy credit though. He doesn't give a shit what other people think of him. He dresses how he wants to dress. He accessorizes how he wants to accessorize. Good for him. As a kid, I found it embarrassing to go places with him. As an adult I realized that you just gotta look at it one way, ""that's just him"". 

So, lately, we've both been trying to be friends. Like I said, we fought like hell when we were kids, but we're not kids anymore. Our parents aren't gonna live forever, and when they are gone, we're gonna have each other and our stepsister for family. And I think we're doing a good job of it. We're trying to experience a little of each other's worlds. I had to go to a renaissance fair for work last weekend and I invited him and his wife, they love that crap, not really my cup-o-tea. And yesterday he came to the ball game with me. The ball game was actually his idea. He originally wanted to get tix as a b-day present for me. But him and his wife are struggling financially right now and he decided that it would be a little too expensive to get both the tix. But I haven't seen my favorite team play in a couple of years, and it's been a long time since I've been this close to a city where they would play...so why not! So we each got tix, and went to the game last night.

And it was cool. He didn't seem bored to tears. He showed interest, asked questions about the game and players. Depending on how long I'm here, I think it would be fun to do once a year when my team is in town. So yeah, it was cool. And I know my parents love the fact that he and I are interacting on our own.

Good game too. But my team lost. And that sucked. But all in all, it was a fun evening.

Since it's Sunday, instead of favorite on-air story I'd like to make a few observations:

*Please please please vote this year! I'm a young guy, but this is, without a doubt, the most important presidential race of my lifetime, and I have a feeling it's going to take every single vote this year.

*I've always thought certain trends were silly. They can look ridiculous, but if someone sees somebody on TV doing it, it'll catch on. What is it these days with the turned up collars on polo shirts?? It's not sexy boys, it looks silly.

*Let me make an addendum to my first observation. That only applies if you're planning to vote for Kerry. If you were planning on voting for the others (Bush, Nader, etc), feel free not to vote this year. :-P

*If you can't take a tease, don't read the above addendum."

I then read it back to myself and it's honestly one of the most ridiculous things I have ever taken out of my brain and expressed in a semi-public fashion. Life doesn't need to be this complicated. This shit is for high schoolers, not 20-something professionals (no offense to any high schoolers present, honest). I need to chill the f-out, stop overthinking every goddamn situation and just take life as it comes. I've learned a number of important lessons in my life, and one of them is the following:

If you try too hard to control a situation, if you try too hard for the outcome you think you want, it's all gonna blow the f-up in your face. 

I'm not a terribly religious person...I can't say I've LEARNED this per se, but I can say that I've noticed something: life, and situations in it, have a way of working themselves out. There seems to be a natural progression to things. Is an outcome ""meant to be"" or predestined? Shit, I dunno. I like to think that *I* have some control over where my life goes. But it's also been pretty frickin wacky the past year or so. And, if I was in complete control, I'd never have guessed I'd be sittin' where I am right now.

And, especially when other people are involved, who am I to presume that a situation is mine to control? Is there an outcome I'd like to see? Yeah. But then again, what happens if that outcome does come to pass? Is that the best thing to have happen right now? Quite possibly not. Most likely not. No, I'm pretty sure it's a bad idea at this exact point in time.

I already said this, but; I don't know if I can say that there is a natural progression to life. But I can say that, lately, I have seen that things have a way of working themselves out. I need to stop overthinking shit, stop worrying what other people think, and enjoy life as it happens. 

The internet isn't necessarily the best thing in the world. Face to face interaction is the most sincere. It's much easier to fake it online then in person. Take the face to face and form your conclusion based on that. Everyone uses the internet differently and interacts with people differently online. If you try to start deconstructing someone's online interaction habits, you're just gonna run into trouble. Take the face to face, base your opinion on that.

I refuse medication, I don't like the thought of being altered from my natural chemical state. 

I refuse counseling, I'm a Jew, money is important to me. I'm not gonna waste it paying someone listen to me bitch.

I enjoy my insanity, it's endearing.



Favorite on-air story of the day: Bea Arthur (Dorothy from The Golden Girls) stopped at an airport checkpoint with a pocket knife in her carry on. Says it's not hers, and terrorists must have planted it there. (Ok, I didn't use this punch on the air, but I'll use it here...my insanity may be endearing, but that's just plain crazy)."

"event","Long day yesterday. Decided to come in a little earlier then usual to look good for the boss. He likes to give me a hard time sometimes, ""oh, you're showing up for work today huh?"". But one thing I've learned about my boss is that he likes to give people a hard time. If he really means it, he'll sit you down and tell you. But, even with teasing, it'll still get to you sometimes. If someone kept saying to you, ""hey, still got a big ass huh?"" but they were teasing, I'm guessing it'd still get to ya a little. 

So yeah, I show up early and there is a problem. The midday girl is on vacay this week and the shift is being filled by voice tracking. Well, because of all the computer problems last week, the VT isn't working. So I went on an hour early. Now I gotta say, I can't complain about a 5 hour air shift. Some people sit at a customer service desk for 8 hours a day, how can I complain about sitting in a studio for 5? But, when you're not expecting it and you're not prepared, that first hour is a LONG one, which causes a ripple effect in the rest of the shift. So yeah, it was a long day yesterday. 

Beautiful weather though. I'm enjoying that part.

Still weird stuff with the whole meeting people/forming feelings situation. Trying to figure out how to handle a situation or two.

Favorite on-air story of the day: A truck carrying 42,000 pounds of jelly overturns on a South Carolina highway (It caused quite a jam <insert rimshot here>)."

"event","It's definitely interesting re-connecting with old friends. Ever since, I would say, the middle of my freshman year in college, I've had this desire to kind of do it all over again. Not because I would do anything differently, I have a strict ""no regret"" policy, but I'd love to do high school again as the person I am today. Which, of course, brings up the whole debate of ""but isn't that what MADE you who you are today?"" yeah yeah, indulge me.

I'm really looking forward to my high school reunion. I know a lot of people don't, a lot of people don't bother going, and a lot of people just want to whoop it up with the football team one more time. I'm not looking forward to it because I'll get a chance to be prom king one more time, or the star quarter back. I wasn't any of those things in the first place. I'm looking forward to it because I can't wait to walk into that room carrying myself with a confidence that I never had before. I'm not that shy, quiet ""...who?"" kid anymore. 

I wish I lived closer to some of my old HS friends and aquaintences. I'd love to sit down with a cup of coffee and see who they have become...and show them who I have become. I mean I'm still ""me"" of course, but there is definitely a difference in the ""me"" of today. 

But this LJ thing is a start I think. It's a small introduction into my world today. And I know at least a couple of those people I'd like to have a cup of coffee with know who this mysterious ""neradioguy"" is. Which I think is appropriate. For a little while I thought the whole anonymity thing was silly. Overly dramatic. But the fact of the matter is, for those people who do know me, I think it adds something to go into this without using my name. Kind of gives them a chance to look at me with fresh eyes and an open mind.

This is the first time in my life that I have been 100% happy with who I am, and comfortable being who I am around other people.

That's cool."

Actually that should be easy since Friday was, more or less an unevenful day. Except for the fact that the ex came for a visit this weekend. I was expecting him around 11 but, he surprised me and took yesterday as a vacation day from work, and showed up at my door about 10 mins after I got home from work. I was shocked to see him that early, but it was a nice surprise.

He helped me with a work event I had to do yesterday which was cool. But we got DUMPED on! I have never been stuck in a rain storm like that in my life. I was soaked through to my organs I was so wet. But, the nice thing was, at the event I had to wear a kind of uniform that they gave me, so I got to change back into dry clothes after...lucky me ;). After that we did some local sight seeing which was lots of fun. 

It was actually a really nice, fun weekend. Which, of course, made the whole situation that much worse. I really, truly think that this is my soul mate. But we're at a stalemate. I'm in a business where unstability is the rule and he's tied to his family in New England. But I'm a people person, I want to be with someone. I don't want to be single and live alone for the rest of my life. But I'm also not going to date someone just to not be single. I don't know what to do from here. 

Favorite on-air story of the day (Friday): Teenager breaks the record for consecutive hours of television viewing, watching for 52 hours straight. His father's reaction, ""Well, he's gotta be good at something"". (Some kids are good at academics, some kids are good at sports, but dammit my kid can watch some serious tv!)"

"event","So apparently I talk to my traffic reporter too much. I really enjoy the on-air interaction and think it makes the whole thing more authentic. One of the hardest parts of broadcasting is touching your audience (and funny enough, at the same time, one of the easiest parts of broadcasting is getting members of your audience to let you touch 'em, go figure). It's really difficult to sound like you're talking TO someone, not AT them. So what could make that easier then actually having someone to talk to? 

And I love my traffic reporter. First of all, she's hugely talented and sounds awesome. At the same time, she is a great person. I think we ""clicked"" right away both on the air and off. She quickly learned a lot about me personally and has been very supportive and genuine. It's good to have ""that person"" here. Especially coming into a situation knowing nobody; no friends nearby, no family nearby, no support system. But I digress. 

Apparently we talk too much. I ""get distracted"", and I've been told to curb the on-air interaction. If I was a more established talent, if they needed me more then I need them, if I had a reputation to stand on, I could do whatever I want. But, the fact of the matter is, I'm still a kid in this business. I'm still building that rep, I need them more then they need me, I gotta do what I'm told. So I have to find that balance of personality and interaction. Gotta keep it authentic, gotta keep the boss happy. I think it'll take a few days to find that balance, but I think we can find a comfort zone.

Really interesting stuff in the personal world as well. Now the decision is, do I keep this about the wonderful world of broadcasting, or should I spill it all? Hmmmm.

"event","Y'know what. This is cathartic. Why not keep using it? Why leave my legacy on the net as a bitter employee trying like hell to get out? I think it would be good to show that a career in broadcasting can be just as good as it can be bad.

That being said...all hell broke loose yesterday! These days, everyone uses digital broadcasting systems. CDs are things of the past. Digital systems have a few advantages; good quality, good features, automation (yeah, thanks, that's what put me out of my last job!), etc. Most places use one of three systems; Prophet (mostly Clear Channel stations since, *shock*, they own Prophet), Audio Vault (many Infinity stations), and Scott Studios (still pretty well used, but a little clunky). I've used all three, they all have positives and negatives. 

But, of course, there is a problem with computers: they crash. Even the best computer systems in the world burp every now and again. Well yesterday, our system had some serious indigestion. First crash, panic! No CDs in the studio...me running down the hall, the boss was on the phone ""WE'RE OFF THE AIR!! I NEED A CD NOW!!"" Engineer in his office doing some strange engineery thing (man those guys are odd) ""I'M OFF THE AIR, THE COMPUTER STOPPED!! HELP!!"". Computer reset, back on after two songs on CD. *Whew*. 10 mins later, same thing. ""I'M OFF THE AIR AGAIN, I NEED MORE CDs!!"" This time we went for about half an hour. And, at the same time, the internet computer decided that it all looked really fun and crashed as well.

So now; trying to find CDs I haven't played yet and are still current, talking after every song since there were no IDs available, I've lost IM contact with my traffic reporter, and I've got an engineer running in and out and in and out. By the way, engineers don't give a shit about on-air performance, as long as there is a signal going over the air, they've done their jobs. There could be a loop of a ferret farting going over the air, as long as you could pick it up on your car radio, they're happy. The big red ""On-Air"" light might as well be a big red ""Come On In And Use Some Power Tools. Don't Mind The Fact That I'll Be Done In 20 Seconds, Make All The Noise You'd Like Right Now"" light (although I do admit that it would have to be a rather large light for that). 

Long story short, it got ""fixed"". I put that in quotes because, well, first I was afraid of it happening again for the rest of my shift. And it did happen again at the end of my shift. But, at that point, ""SEP""...yes Hitchhiker's Guide fans, ""Somebody Else's Problem"".

A couple hours of fun for about 45 minutes of sheer panic and stress. My back hurt like hell when it was all over and I felt like I was gonna pass out. 

God I love radio!

So yeah, things got a lot worse before they got better. Lost the full time job (which, as you remember, I wasn't happy at anyway), ended the relationship, moved home...not the way I planned things.

HOWEVER, I've been working at this new gig here for a couple months and it's been great. I'm working for a great company in an interesting place I never would have guessed I'd end up. I'm doing afternoons in a good market. Without getting too specific, this area has a potential audience of about 1.3 million. 

""Everything happens for a reason"" is what ""they"" say. It was a twisted journey, but it seems to be all good right now. On the work front at least.

I had all sorts of bad stuff happen the last two weeks...and last night I got pulled over! What for? ""Unsafe lane change"". Yeah, I changed lanes without my blinker in front of a cop (of course I didn't KNOW it was in front of a cop). Don't get me wrong, I didn't cut him off, there was plenty of room...I just didn't use my signal. So I found out that was a $100 dollar ticket. Had to look it up on the internet though...why? Because I don't HAVE the ticket! When the cop gave me back my documents he must have dropped the ticket or something because all I had when I got home was my license, registration, and the envelope to mail in the ticket. But no ticket! So now I have to make a million phone calls to find out what to do about that because the LAST think I want to happen is to have my license suspended for blowing off a ticket! 

And don't even ASK about the job search...my phone has been deafeningly quiet. Of course I've gotten emails from my mentors, who are jocks in top 5 markets, telling me how great I sound on my latest demo...which makes me feel good and all...but still nobody's biting. At what point do I give up? I'm miserable dammit...probably almost clinically depressed. But I don't want to be unemployed...and it's always easier to find a job when you have a job (I'd hate to see what it would be like if I DIDN'T have a job!). Gotta keep truckin' I guess."

Sometimes they take their time getting back to people. They try to go through as many packages as possible. So I haven't lost ALL hope yet. But it's getting close.

It's just so frustrating. All my close radio friends say I should have no problem getting a job...so why am I? These aren't people who would say something just to be ""nice"". If they didn't think this was for me they'd say so. They wouldn't say, ""you suck, quit"" but they probably would say something like, ""you know what, maybe this isn't for you"".

"event","Ok so it's been a while since my last update. Not too much new though. PT graduated from college which is strange. We've been together since he STARTED college. It makes me feel old to think that I've been with him through his whole college career. Oh well, a friend recently told me, ""you're only as old as you feel"". But he's got a great job for the summer which could turn into a great full time job. I was hoping to have a new full time job by the time he graduated so we could both start out somewhere new. But if he gets this full time job I'm obviously not going to try to stop him. We'll just have to wait and see where things take me...and us. 

In work news I've decided that, for the time being, I should try to get some part time work in a nearby market. There are some pretty big markets in New England and it would be great to get some part time hours at one of those places on my resume. I wouldn't have a life...but hopefully it would be worth it in the long run. I HOPE I will be able to at least get some interest in part time stuff.

Everyone keeps saying, ""it'll happen when the time is right,"" etc. It's so hard to believe that I've been at this for so long. Not to sound egotistical but I don't suck. I've had some pretty good demos lately. I guess it's just the job market. 

Well, as I've said numerous times right here...I just gotta stick with it and not give up. NOTHING will happen if I give up and SOMETHING will HAVE to happen eventually if I stick with it. Lol, they're getting to know me pretty well at the post office!

"event","So here's the deal...

I responded to an ad back at the end of March for a great job in a great market. I didn't hear anything back for about two weeks so I figured I was out of the running. But then my phone rang...it was the Program Director of the station. He got my demo and resume and wanted to interview me over the phone. We spoke for about half an hour and I really thought it went quite well. He ended the call with, ""I'll be in touch"". 

Flash forward three weeks. He had told me that they wanted to fill the job ""quickly"" so I figured, after three weeks, they probably would have called me back if I was one of the final candidates. So I got up the balls to call today and, unfortunately, got the answer I expected...""we've hired someone local"". So that's it with that one too. A damn shame too, like I said, it was a great position in a great market. I would have been closer to my family and not too far from PT. ""Too good to be true"" I guess. 

So it's back to square one now. I just hope it's not another year before I get a response from my mailings. The one thing everyone keeps telling me is, ""it'll happen when the time is right"". So here's hoping that the ""right time"" comes around soon! Man this is tough....huge disappointment."

"event","Ok for starters I can't believe I got up at 6 this morning just so I'd be ready for 2morrow. It was kinda hard to cause I didn't get alot of sleep last night.....I spoke my mind and I got yelled at for my feelings....I'm sick and sore all over and school starts 2morrow...I was so frustrated already and then some idiot decided to yell at me and tell me what I already knew they thought because they've said it before,only not yelling at me. After that I sorta lost grip I guess....I've sorta been falling back into a bad habit and last night just added to the pressure to do it, only I couldn't tell myself not to and listen last night....I'm so weak and susceptible sometimes and I hate it. If your reading this and your the one who yelled at me....thanks....alot....for making me see that I'm just done with it all....I give up."

"event","...ok this person I care about really deeply won't stop blaming themselves for hurting me. I have told her over and over its not their fault,which it isn't, but that doesn't make any difference. I really wish she would stop blaming herself. I really do care entirely too much about her to sit here knowing she's balming herself.Well here lately ever since my last update I haven't been able to or draw anything. writting and drawing are usually my ways out. But finally last night I drew something....its really simple and idk if I like it, but its about this person who I'm hurting with blame and I think the caption I put with the pic says it all."

"event","Ok its like 1:15 or sumthing and I just can't sleep. So many things have just happened at once and it i just don't know what to do. Someone I knew just died in a car accident and that just turned everything upside down. Then reality decided to add in an extra slap to the face by hitting me with the truth. The fact that I knew it was coming with this person just didn't help. In fact i think once they started saying what they did it was just worse. And then while I'm still awake like this a friend of mine found out something that really upset and hurt her so I snuck out and went to talk to her about it. When I left to come back home a confrontation was about to happen and I really do hope things turn out ok for her because she doesn't need nething bad in her life. She works so hard and deserves to be happy. I don't know if what I do everyday is just not worthy or what, but I always seem to get so close to happiness and then it all crashes down and falls apart. This time though I'm afraid it hurt worse than it ever could have any other time. I feel like I've lost someone, but I really want her to be happy with her life and I really hope that things go the way she wants them to.I do have to say though that I don't think neone's ever made me cry the way I did when she told me the truth........I just really don't know anymore."

"event","Ok so I've got this secret. Its a secret that like 4 people already know. 2 of which i deff didn't want them to know and 1 I'm not sure of. The other one though I deffinitly wanted them to know. But now there's the fact that it's a secret that my family doesn't know, but at some point my mom will have to find out. When she does though I don't know how it will go because I already know her opinion on that particular subject. I'm really feeling torn because on one hand I want her to know so I don't have to keep hiding it from her but on the other hand I don't want to tell her because of how she will react and what she might do. I really just don't know......"

"event","...ok so I've been pounced on and told to update my entries. Who pounced? That doesn't matter to neone else. Anyway I've pretty much worked my summer away, whether thats good or bad idk. I finally turned 16 and I now have my permit.(color me excited)lol.  I got over my nervousness and my cowardice and spilled my guts to someone and I was so happy when I did it cause it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Of course with something happy there is gonna be something not so happy so idk how to feel about it right now. Ok so I think I have run out of things to say for now but no worries I will be back soon....otherwise I might be pounced on again...then again maybe I won't be back soon hehe."

"event","Ok so this is just might be the first time I'm up front about everything and not being very vague.That person that asked me out....well......we're not going out and I think its mainly because of joe. It makes me really sad to cause I like that person, but what can I do I dont want to make anyone feel like I'm trying to make them do something they don't want to do. When life dissapoints me I tend to try and move on, but I feel like joe will always be there when I wanna be with someone else. I don't know what to do, which is really nothing new to be honest. Now I'm gonna end this lil update with a slightly odd saying I have.....
~When you love someone,its something.When someone loves you its another thing.When you love the person who loves you back,its everything.~"

"event","I'm so tired of all this drama. High school is just like one big problem sometimes. I walk through it everyday afraid that I'm gonna do or say the wrong thing. Then theres the fact that when I like a guy 9 times out of 10 one of my friends likes him too and I don't wanna hurt my friends by getting involved with someone they like. This particular situation has popped up recently and very unexpectedly too. I know what I want to do, but I don't want to lose a friend over it. I guess I worry alot about other people, but I love all my friends and I don't want to see any of them hurt. I'm tired of worrying all the time and I think I'm about to just explode with worry. I want to stop it some......but idk if I can. I wish someone could help me with it."

"event","I knew it would happen at some point I mean everyone meets someone that can just totally push their buttons. Well I finally met that person who just does it for me. I feel like I should hate them, but I can't lol. I don't know why its so easy for them either. The bad thing is though I can't say that it bothers me as much as it would if it were someone else. It's pretty funny at times actually. On the other hand though it gives me a wierd feeling b/c of the particular circumstances. I know I stay pretty vague on here,but its only b/c if I felt that you should know things about me then I'd tell you and if you want to know all you have to do is ask me. Who knows what kind of answers I'll give you."

"event","This little problem thats been keeping me upset.....well it's still here. It won't go away. Luckily though I'm pretty good at keeping it hidden, except from that one person I've talked to about it the most....she's there for me and I'm really glad...it helps to talk to her. I wish I could tell him, but he probably wouldn't understand why its so complicated for me. I am doing a little better though.....just a little. I've met one of those people who can just hurt you with the smallest little comments though.....and I think what makes it even worse is that the words come from his mouth instead of someone else's. For now I'm ok I guess but I'm not sure how long it will last."

"event","....ok so maybe I'm confusing myself more than I should, but I just really don't think this is something I should or even could take lightly. If I admit that I already know what the answer to my little dilemna is then it could be dangerous b/c if my family found out.....well lets not get into that...the point is I'm sure as hell not gonna mention nething that has to do with my problem anymore. I sorta approached the subject with my mom and she just made me cry and it hurt too. There's really only like 3 people who know what I'm talkin about right now one I don't trust, another I really do trust with this and I've spoken with her about this, and the other...well I hope I can trust her and I think I can but you never really know with people anymore."

"event","Ok I'm getting so tired of not knowing why things happen and right now I'm having to really think about why I feel the way I do. I'm not sure why its so hard for me to explain to people.....I mean I know I'm shy,(and i hate it),but I'm not used to the way I feel. Yesterday has really got me thinking, and I mean thinking alot, about who I am. I guess it shows to because I've had alot of people lately asking me whats wrong cause I don't talk as much nemore.....idk"

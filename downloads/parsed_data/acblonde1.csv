"event","today was awesome! We went to a beach on a river called Gunpowder River which is about 2miles from the Chesapeake Bay. Larry taught me how to maneuver a sailboat (it was my first time on one) and then I took wind surfing lessons so now I can do it on my own if i wanted to which i plan to! it's so cool but it takes a lot of energy to get up and stay on but it's worth it. it's a lot of fun. we're going shopping tomorrow in Virginia and we might go to Arlington Cemetery to see the Changing of the Guards. well i guess that's all for now. love and miss you guys tootles

p.s.
Sandy, please call me when you get a chance thanks"

"event","I was so happy things were going better but Saturday night, or I guess it would be Sunday morning, at about 12, we got a call that 911 had been called and they were taking Grandpa to the hospital. I ended up going with dad because sitting at home just wasn't an option. I spent all night there, well until about 5, then stayed with Grandma and then we went back today. He's okay right now and hopefully will be but it's still bad. We weren't sure if he was going to make it at first or not. They gave him 3 pints of blood today and are going to start doing test throughout the next few days. Well I guess that's all for now. I'll talk to everyone later. tootles"

"event","many things have been going on lately yet nothing big or upsetting so i should be happy right? (lol sorry mary) four nights in a row i cried until i made myself so sick i couldn't move or i got calmed down enough to sleep. I ended up calling people the last two nights though because I just couldn't handle things by myself any more. Tyler and Levi were there to help through it all and you honestly do not know what that means to me. I'm very bad about making things all about me so I usually try to just handle things on my own and i just don't like having others be involved when it isn't neccessary so it was a huge deal to come to you guys. I feel horrible though because I called Levi right before he left for Atlanta and it was just bad. I'm not sure if it made a difference on his mood or if he worried more than usual or if it changed anything at all but whatever it did i still shouldn't have called him like that and at that time. But back to my first point...I don't know what I would do without you guys. Knowing me I probably wouldn't be in one piece. I'm sorry for everything I put you guys and everyone else through though. Dad ended up finding me the fourth night crying and started yelling telling me I was stupid and all that because i didn't know what i was crying about. he just figured i had had a fight with levi or something. when he found me the next day crying he decided something had to be done so he made me call a couple of people and they did a world of difference. i haven't cried since and really haven't wanted to so...it's all good i guess. today was the first day or driver's ed. it actually wasn't too bad. kind of boring but not too bad. actually the only thing that was bad was Matt. he just needs to be hit in the head as hard as possible...maybe it'll knock some sense into him. lord knows he doesn't have any now. stupid idiot hit me twice, calling me woman didn't help the situation either, neither did telling me to stop my bitching or go away, then he threw a pen at my head which hit right above my eye. oh he pissed me off!!!! all over a stupid bouncy ball which Birdy told me i could play with. Me and Mary ended up sitting in the grass eating breadsticks and watching the parade at lunch. that was surprisingly like the highlight of the day. it was a blast! so not only am i feeling better but today was good. everything seems to be going okay for now but i highly doubt it is going to stay that way. Thanks again for everyone that has been helping me lately. I'm truly sorry for everything and I'll talk to you guys later."

"event","omg! today was so weird but as the title says surprisingly fun. i woke up today and spent time with chrissy. we even had a picnic outside then i took a blanket outside and was planning on reading. I ended up falling asleep so i got sun burnt and like only half of me is red (i hurt a lot but it's all good) and i look really funny. today chrissy had a western hoe down dance thing for girl scouts in Nashville and i got roped into going. i ended up walking around town most of the time though(i got lost a couple of times lol it's me what do u expect?!). Dad ended up coming by in the tri-axle and honking then a protest guy that knew dad stopped me to talk then some dude that was w/ his wife and another couple asked me if i had ice cream at home and if not where he could find some. lol it was funny his wife hit him in the chest and goes stop being stupid and bothering people! it would be funny if u were there and know what i do to levi all the time. i ended up going to Bigfoot or w/e it's called and got something to drink. on the way there some dude about ran me over w/ a bike and then a group of mexican guys went by and one goes muy bonita i surprised them when i said gracias senor so we talked for a little while. i finally went back to the church to find my mom and sister square dancing. very amusing. i finally went back outside and sat on a bench thinking (i also scared a lady which was kinda funny-she jumped and almost hit her head on a sign). chrissy ended up winning a pink cowboy hat which now belongs to me after paying her with clothes and money. (i love it it's awesome!) so i really didn't do that much today that was of any interest to whoever is reading this but it was a good day, nothing bad happened, and i enjoyed my alone time. i thought a lot about the people around me, especially levi-came to a conclusion about some stuff with that, and things were just.....nice. i haven't actually had a calm relaxing day like this in a long long time so to be able to do that and not be bothered by something was really really nice. well i guess i've babbled enough. i'll talk to all of you later. love lots and lots."

"event","wow it seems like i haven't updated this in months. things have been going semi-good lately so that's something new but i still have stuff to complain about. i always do. a lot of things have happened in the last like month i guess and i've had a lot of different thoughts. my main ones focused on some recent events and a few people from the past. things aren't bad but i'm just so stressed and everything right now it kind of makes it hard. i don't want it to be easy though. if it gets easy then i'll go back to thinking other things and that won't be good either. i'm sure this makes no sense at all. right now my main problem is my growing fear of hurting levi. there is no way on earth that would ever make me want to hurt him but i'm afraid that something is going to happen and i will. i love him with all of my heart and i just can't. i think he trusts me though so i don't think that it is one of his worries but it could be i'm wrong a lot so why not on this? i really have no right to complain but at least it's on this thing and not to an actual person. i don't want to do that. i do that enough. i hugged levi today and i honestly didn't want him to let me go. i could have cried when he did. it was horrible (not the hug my feelings toward it-just clarifying.) sometimes i think wow this could possibly be our last hug or our last time to be together. luckily that hasn't happened yet. i hope it never does. today i was talking to Lizzie about some stuff and she goes you know Levi really loves you. It surprised me not because of what she said but because it came from her. I don't mean that in a bad way it just surprised me that's all. I couldn't say anything all I could do was smile(and blush). I was talking to mom today too. She was asking me how Levi was and everything and she was like so how are you guys doing? I go well a week from your's and dad's anniversary will be our 4 month ""anniversary"" if that tells you anything. She was like you really like this one don't you? Once again all I could do was smile. I started throwing up tonight; it came out of no where so dad is questioning whether i'm pregnant or not. There is no way that that is going to happen!!!!!!!!!!!! If it does then it will be over 10 years down the road when I'm married! And there are no ifs ands or buts about it! It's still funny that he would think something like that. oh well it's dad can't help but love him. well i guess that's all the complaining and releasing of feelings i'll do tonight. hope everyone is good. if not i hope you soon will be. i'm here for any of you at any time. i love you guys. I'll ttyl.

P.S. Levi: Thank you for understanding everything that has been going on and thank you for helping me deal with the stuff. You really shouldn't have to but you do any way and I appreciate that so so much. I love you so much (more than i let show, i know) k ttyl tootles"

"event","I ended up calling Levi last night crying. That wasn't a good thing but he calmed me down a lot. Between him and dad, by about 11:30 last night I was calm. Everything was still there but I wasn't crying and everything else I end up doing. I felt so bad for calling him so late and crying to him. I think that's the first time I've actually went to him. I didn't tell him everything though. Some stuff I've just got to keep with me. It would do no good to tell anyone so until I get over it all I might be a little ugh to deal with. Very sorry in advance. Levi: Thank you so so much though. You have to deal with a lot especially when it comes to me and will still put up with the kind of stuff I did last night. I know I don't go to you for very much but I still feel horrible for actually going to you. It's like I'm even more of a bother than usual. Sometimes though, you need a specific person to talk to and you were it. Thank you. I love you so much! Tonight Mary is doing the same thing except she won't talk to anyone. That's fine I know how that goes. I've been there many times before. I'm just worried about her. I hope everything gets better Mary! And I'm here any time night or day. I need to talk to Sandy. I seem to keep missing her calls and stuff but I haven't talked to her in a long time. I'm actually ready to go back to school. I miss you guys so much! I didn't think I would this much but I do. I found out some stuff today and even though everyone is joking about it I'm really worried. I'm not going to say it on here though. It's something I figured would happen eventually but it was possible it wouldn't. It did though and it's going to be rough. Well Happy Early Easter everyone. I love you all so much and I have no clue what I would do without you. Talk to you later and see you soon."

"event","The past two weeks have just been crazy. Stupid immature and crazy. Thinking I could talk to a friend and thinking they could maybe help me talk to another person I said some things that I shouldn't have. I now know that if I have a problem the best thing to do is just keep it to myself. It keeps me out of trouble I guess. If I can't talk to the person I need to then I'll just keep my mouth shut about the whole thing. Right now I'm still hurt but not for the same reasons. It hurts that someone would distrust me so much to say the things they did. If I have a feeling about something it doesn't mean the other person is in the wrong or that I'm talking down on them. Especially if it is someone I love. I would never hurt the people I love on purpose. I know I do hurt everyone. I've become very good at causing pain. But if I could find a way to stop it all I would. Even if it means going away and never coming back. Last night mom hurt. It's hard to see her like that. I just wanted to leave it all behind and never return. Funny thing is, all I did was bake some cookies. It helped, got my mind off things, but they turned out kind of yucky so... Austin told me I was weird and that he didn't see why anyone would eat peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies. I like them! Not these because I made them from scratch and they are just yucky but oh well. Wow I have went from pain to mom to cookies. I swear I have something wrong with me! I'm in the library right now trying to pass the time. It's hard to believe that this next week we get off for spring break. It's even harder to believe that tomorrow will be mine and Levi's 3 month ""anniversary"". It doesn't feel like it's been three mon. The time slips by slowly but the feelings there are too strong. Sometimes I wonder though, how truly happy he is. With everything I put him through. With everything he's been through and everything he puts up with on top of that he has to put up with me too. It has to be hard on him. I don't see how he does it. I'm always either complaining about something or sick or grouchy or bitchy or...something. I don't know. Maybe it's another way of pushing. I guess I think if I push him he can't get too close and I can't hurt him. The truth is I don't think I could handle it if I pushed him away for good. I don't know what I would do with out him. If he was ever unhappy and wanted away from me I would do so without a second thought. All I want, have ever want, and will ever want is for him to be happy. As I've said many times before, even if it wasn't w/ me. With everything that has happened the thought of losing him has been on my mind. I'm not sure why. It's just so real and seems as though it could happen at any moment. But I really dont know. I guess time can only tell. Well this is just a bunch of random thought's that have been in my head for the last couple of days. That's not even all of them which is sad but oh well. Okay I complain way too much and will stop here. I love you all with all of my heart. I'll talk to you all later. Have a wonderful spring break and I'll see you when we get back. love always tootles"

I know I was not easy to deal with today and I am so so sorry. There are some reasons but I am not going to share them. I honestly do not know where I would be right now if it was not for all of you. Today when I got to school I wanted, no needed, to be home, but I could not. I was not sure how long I was going to last. If it was not for everyone I would not have lasted past first block. I am so sorry for worrying everyone. It was not fair to all of you.  
Levi: Thank you for being there today and thank you for the note you gave me. I did cry but it is all good! I swear though, if I did not love you before today I know I do now. To me everything was so stupid and you should not have had to go through it all. Most people would have just given up on me but you did not. You stuck by me and made sure I was okay. My heart truly belongs to you. 
Mary: Thank you for everything you said and showed and did. I'm am very sorry for worrying you and making you cry. I know she is important and I thank you for thinking of her like that. Mom squared always! Thank you for all of the support.
Tyler: Thank you for the spankie comment! It did cheer me up, truly! I am sorry I would not talk to you it is just...I could not. Thank you for putting up with me. Zack too! Thank you for caring and worrying and being there and all of that. 
Sandy: Thank you for the candy bar and the smile! (Turn that frown upside-down you silly clown!). It truly meant a lot and helped a lot. 
To the people that don't really know what is going on I am sorry this whole thing is probably very confusing. It probably seems like I am thanking you for no reason but believe me there is a huge reason. I just truly would not be able to make it through this kind of stuff without all of you. I know that I do not show it enough but all of you mean the world to me. Oh and by the way someone please remind me to apologize to the people I snapped at today! Well I just wanted to tell everyone thank you. I am sure I now sound like I am crazy so I guess I will end it here. Again, I am sorry. Love you all so so much!!!!! tootles"

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately but haven't been thinking about anything at all. It's confusing, I really can't explain it. Right now I don't know if I'm coming or going or falling or flying. I really don't know what to do about anything right now. Nothing bad has really happened but I feel like something will. I don't know maybe it's all the stuff with dad. For those of you that haven't heard about it: Dad has decided that I am going to break up with Levi, stop talking to all of the guys I talk to, and to sum it up just not have a social life at all. It's not like I have a huge social life any way. I never do anything or go anywhere and I shut myself out from most people any way. I really don't know. I know that he can hurt me all he wants any way he wants but that stuff isn't going to happen. I've talked to Terry again. I really don't know what's going to happen with all of that. Most people have only saw one part of it all so they really don't know but...ugh...i don't even know ne more. I mean, I finally feel like I've just put myself back together and that totally wasn't easy. Ask the people/main person that helped. I guess time can only tell. no worries i guess. no one is allowed to worry about me. i seem to only cause trouble and pain.  ugh! i need to get away from here and away from people and just away! that's horrible though. omg! justin, chrissy's cat, got ran over today and died. Chrissy cried forever. i couldn't feel sorry for her though. She was like be nice to me I liked that cat. I was sitting there thinking since you've had that cat I've lost a bunny and two kittens. I was being really really mean. I've been really really mean. Levi was in a weird mood the other night and for the first time he was trying to push me away. I'm not sure why. I don't even know if he knows why. He might, he probably does but I don't know. Dad and me were arguing tonight because I didn't want to go outside with Chrissy so she could water her dog. Dad's like it won't kill you. I go it might and he smarts off I'm not lucky enough. I was just like thanks dad. useless info. all of this is useless. just me complaining. oh well hopefully it will keep me from complaining to other people. i really don't want to complain to other people. i do it way too much. okay ending it here i need to type in my other journal. i'll talk to you guys later. i love you so much and i don't know what i would do without you. cya later. lyl tootles"

"event","I feel like complaining but don't want to go to anyone. I complain enough, actually too much, to everyone as it is so.... Ugh! 9 yrs. ago today Grandpa Robertson died. Grandma didn't even know what today was. Neither did Dale or Mom and Dad. Grandma Cody was the only one that did. I went to church and had to sit w/ Grandma all cuddled up next to Wilburn. I felt like killing him. That's horrible especially w/ a thought like that in church. Ted Bass passed away yesterday. I can't go to the funeral though because no one wants to take me out of school. He reminded me so much of Grandpa. He had the big round belly and the chubby jolly cheeks and always had a smile on his face and a surprise in his pockets. lol santa. it's just sad. both were wonderful people. dad's being an ass again. he was talking about how stupid levi was. i asked him why he thought he was stupid. his reply was that he claims to like you. that really hurt. he went on about how no one could truly love me and how i would never find any one and i didn't deserve the people i had and all this other stuff about me being worthless. it wasn't really what i needed today. i've heard so much of it i'm starting to believe that it's true. people will disagree with me, i think, but....yeah. i wanted to see levi today so bad but i couldn't. i was like grrrrr! i'm talking to mary right now! i love her! i don't know what i would do w/ out her....w/out ne of my friends. mom goes in for surgery tuesday morning. they won't let me go. i hate hospitals so they're afraid i won't make it being in there through the day. they're right, i wouldn't, but i still want to go! i guess i'm staying after that day and walking to the bank to meet grandma later. then going down that night. which sucks ass! i want to be there w/ mom so much. dad's yelling so i guess i should go. talk to you guys later. love you bunches and bunches. tootles"

"event","I stayed after with Levi today again. It was fun...odd...but fun. It was good just to be with him one on one. I think we really needed that. We've drifted apart but I think we're finally getting close again. I hope it stays that way. I'm not sure I could take another break like that. It was scary. As you guys could tell I didn't take it too well. I don't feel good at all. I haven't all day. I feel like all of the energy has been removed from my body. Chrissy was asking more 3rd grade questions that I couldn't answer. It's horrible. I really should be able to answer some of that stuff but I can't. I'm like the most horrible person in the world to come and talk to when it comes to that kind of stuff. Chrissy's mad at me now because she had one of her friends over and she like stayed glued to my side most of the time. I thought Chrissy was going to hit her. She was like she is my big sissy not yours! I was lk wow! okay leaving now! It's very bad. I got out of my sleepover! It's great. No Barbie's or Harry Potter!!!!! Wow this is a lot of babble! Well I've gotta go so I'll end it here. I'll update more later. tootles

Valentine's Day is coming up. that sucks. i hate that day w/ a passion. many reasons why but i won't go into that. i want to talk to him about it because something really doesn't feel right but i don't know how i would bring it up and i'm not sure i want to get into another of our very serious me wanting to cry for no reason this is way too creepy convos so.... i really don't know what to do. he'll prolly read this and then talk to me maybe so....ugh! my eye hurts! it seems like something is really really wrong w/ everyone but everyone is pretty much fine. it's very weird and annoying and many other things that i don't feel lk thinking about. like stuff has gone on and it's bad but it's just lk ummm okay sure w/e. yet i could just sit down and cry and lately that's all i've really done. i get alone and it's just....it's bad. i don't know what the problem is. i've felt so lonely lately too it's bad. i feel like i'm really really alone even w/ people right there and i don't want to be alone yet i don't want any one around. it's just messed up. okay well that's enough complaining and everything else. i'll ttyl. love you all bunches and bunches."

"event","Today has been extremely weird. Not just parts....the whole day. I still feel so bad that Sandy feels this way! We were both nominated for homecoming queen. Personally I wish that she would win. She totally deserves it! I think Levi should win too! I got to spend about two hours after school with Levi today. It was totally freaky and funny and nice yet totally weird. We were sitting in a chair together and I was on his lap. We were kind of playing around. Just tickling each other and teasing each other and all that. This guy comes up and he's like this really is not the place for this. We were like okay and didn't really make an effort to move. He's like I am serious! This is not the place! So we got up and went somewhere else. It was funny though. People passed by a bunch and never said a word except that guy. The other night we spent like six hours on the phone talking. It was great and I found out a lot of stuff. He doesn't realize how much it means to me that he told me the stuff he did. We were both really uncomfortable with each other. We still are. We got really close today and I was hoping the closer we got and stuff the less nervous we would be and things wouldn't be so weird. It kind of backfired though because I think it made things a lot weirder. I just had fun being there and being with him and spending time w/ him w/out this huge group. I'm not sure how he felt about the whole thing. I think tomorrow will be fun. I'll get to spend more time w/ Levi which is wonderful. I hope the more time we spend together the nervousness will just drop. I think things with Jessie are settled now. She came up to me and was crying and stuff. I didn't feel like going into a whole big don't talk to me and all that thing so I talked to her and we're okay now. She's not my favorite person in the world but we aren't fighting and we dont' hate each other. It works. The main thing that bothered me was that she said the only reason she ever went off and me and stuff was because Justin said that I was saying shit about her. He said he never did and that he was just upset and was complaining and she decided to go off on me. I'm not sure who to believe because I think Justin would tell her I was saying stuff. I never said a word though. Oh well. It's in the past now. Things seem to be going good with everyone. I really hope it stays that way. Everyone deserves it. Well I guess that's all for now. Talk to you guys later. Love you lots and lots. tootles"

Have you ever had a bad day that doesn't seem like it could ever get better because you don't even know what made it bad in the first place then you talk to someone and it just makes your whole day? Like it doesn't matter what happened earlier that day at all because you talked to them and that's all that counts? It's a weird, stupid feeling. And it sounds stupid to hear and sit here and type and I'm sure it makes no sense whatsoever. My medicine is screwing up so I've felt kinda bad but it's okay. Somethings always wrong w/ me so this is nothing new. I was supposed to call the doctor today and find out what to do but i forgot. Actually I just kind of fell asleep. It works though. I didn't feel like dealing with everyone so I went to sleep. I never did get to stay after. Maybe another day. Hopefully I won't need the time and things will get better. I shouldn't say better though because there's really nothing wrong. I'm stressed out about stuff but other than that I'm fine. I hope everyone else is fine too. Sandy: I hope things with your family get better. I'm praying for you and your aunts family. Don't worry her kids will be fine. It'll just take some time.

"event","Right now it seems as if life is so horrible, but there's really no reason for it. I mean there's a reason but it's stupid and not many people know the reason so most just think I'm okay or just really sick. I am really sick but that's not my only problem right now. I know my problem but I don't know why I have the problem and why I keep hanging on to it. I shouldn't. I should be able to just let everything from the past go and enjoy everything happening right now. There are a few people that make that hard though. I'm tired of bringing it up. I don't mean to....it just happens. No one knows how much I want to just put it behind me. I got home today and felt hungry. I can't remember what I ate but as soon as I did I threw it up. It was horrible. Dad was in a good mood and an even better mood after seeing my report card so that was good. I was so tired but I didn't want to sleep. I finally gave up and did. I've been sleeping way to much again. Well sort of. I didn't sleep well the night before. I want to talk to someone that doesn't know I have problems and that I can trust. I haven't found that person yet. It would probably be a good idea to at least fill in Levi, but I'm not sure I'm ready. I worry about too much stuff and I stress way too much and I make a big deal out of a little problem a lot. I really really need to stop, but I'm not positive how....yet. I'm tired of not knowing things and I'm tired of doing things I can't stand so I'm going to figure out some stuff. Even if that means a lot of time by myself. I hate being by myself a lot. I do it a lot but usually I don't want to talk to the people around me. I figure maybe staying after tomorrow (if it's not raining) and just walking around Nashville....maybe it'll clear my head a little bit. idk tho. i figure i'll just end up sitting somewhere and crying by myself. Okay well I guess I'll end it here. Hope everyone is fine. Love you lots and lots!"

I sat down with him today at lunch and I just started crying and then I gave him the note I wrote him and then he gave me one. I couldn't stop crying and he just held me there. He's like it'll be okay, you'll be fine, things will be just fine, everything will get better, don't worry about it. I'm sitting here thinking I'm doing this to you. You shouldn't be this calm or worry about me this much!I felt/feel lower then dirt! I am selfish and I....IDK. I can't even remember everything that happened today.

I lk his brother Caleb! he's sooo cute! and the rest of his family is great and seems to like me but i'm so afraid i'm going to screw up or something. i'm very good at screwing stuff up. most of you know this and i've stated it lk a million times. i can talk to mary or tyler or anyone else about my fears of the whole hurting justin thing but when i go to tell justin i just freeze up. you prolly know this too. lk i can't talk to him about ne thing serious. and it's not him because i have talked to him about serious stuff but when it deals w/ me and stuff....it's bad. i had a visitor lk two nights ago i think. it was sooo scary. i woke up at lk 2 in the morning w/ a person standing over me wanting to talk to me. i guess he remembered where the key was outside and got in. i didn't want to talk to him but i did. i'm still not fully over everything that happened between us (no it wasn't terry by the way). that's another thing me and levi got into today. he doesn't think i know what's going on around me and what can happen. i've been through enough w/ guys, truly enough to last me a life time, that i know what can happen and i know not to trust guys so much. i still don't trust many people. but the few i do trust, they've had to work hard to earn it. i don't feel like adding more so i'll stop here. i'll talk to all of you later. love you guys one way or another. ttyl tootles"

"event","i never never never want to repeat this thanksgiving break! by the way i hope that everyone has had a good thanksgiving. lets see...what all happened...? well wednesday night my aunt was on her way to indiana from missouri. she hit a patch of black ice and got into an accident. if she hit the guardrail lk 15 ft. down she would've went over a 40ft. embankment. wonderful huh? she didn't get to make it to thanksgiving and my grandmother was in a really really bad mood! i'm just glad everyone was okay! the jimmy is totaled though but that can be replaced with time. lexy and cody and aunt cindy can't. well grandpa left thanksgiving day after lunch and went all the way out to missouri to get cindy and everyone. no one was happy about that either because grandpa has been in really bad shape. he was supposed to go Mayo Clinic but decided against it. thanksgiving was pretty much filled with a bunch of fighting and crying. then i found out my cousin's husband left her and her daughter. just more to add to the wonderful day. well the rest of the week was actually pretty fun. i got to spend time with aunt cindy and lexy. but aunt cindy left today so i've been a very big cry baby. i hate when she leaves. everyone i've ever gotten close to has went away and everytime she leaves it's lk she is repeatedly getting taken away. the feeling sucks! i don't feel lk going to school. tyler told me some stuff that i didn't expect but that's okay. no biggie nothings changed. i've been trying to talk to justin about some serious stuff. mainly feelings but i can't seem to find the words or know when to bring it up. i really really really like him. more then i have ne one else. but i've already said that many time. i'm just so afraid of screwing everything up and/or really hurting him. and i don't want to. that's the last thing i want to do. i'd rather start cutting again and going through all of the bad stuff instead of hurt him. but i'm very good at screwing things up and messing things up and all of that. by the way sandy i'm sorry you've been going through all of that and i'm glad to here that u have turned to God that is the right thing to do. and i'm so sorry that i haven't been there for you. things have just been changing and have been so different. we've both changed a lot. we need to get together some time soon. just to talk and stuff. well i've gotta go. i'll talk to all of you later. love you lots! tootles"

"event","have you ever felt like everything in your life is just totally perfect. like no matter what happens as long as this keeps going and this stays good you'll be fine and things keep going good and nothing is wrong and everything is just...perfectly perfect and you know that you should be enjoying every moment of it because things don't always go well but you can't enjoy it because you know that in a little while everything perfect will be over. Things will happen and your life will go back to being totally sucky. You can't enjoy a thing because you are looking in the future and not at what's happening right now. i think that sometimes we look at what happened in the past too hard and try to see what's coming in the future too much. Appreciate what you have right now and enjoy life. It's something that I've never been very good at. I hang on to the past too much and I dread the future. Anyone close to me knows this. Right now though things are actually good. I have nothing to really complain about. Dad and I are supposed to be picking out my class ring Sat. and I hope to be able to spend some extra time with Justin this week. He really confused me yesterday and I want to ask a few things but I'm not exactly sure how to bring up the whole thing. Well I guess that's all for now. I'll write more later."

"event","OMG! I'm so bored! (not that that isn't obvious from the subject title thingy) i thought about just ending my journal but when i thought about it some more i decided not to. a few people have gotten my journal address (totally my fault i know) but i guess it's a good thing. i've always been able to say how i feelon here. most of the time i can't do that in person. I'm still confused about a bunch of stuff. Today was mine and Justin's 2 month anniv. not that big of a deal cuz 2 months isn't that long but being 15 it kind of is. he gave me a really beautiful heart necklace last week. i could have killed him! then kiss him lol! i love the fact that he cares enough to do that kind of stuff but he never lets me do anything for him at all plus i hate getting gifts. it makes me feel really bad. not sure why. he's not allowed to do that kind of stuff when he won't let me return the caring (not exactly how i wanted to word it but it works) i still feel worthless and feel as though i could screw up anything given a good amount of time. tomorrow is chrissy's birthday and the day after that mom's. i just finished decorating cupcakes so chrissy could take them to school tomorrow. although i probably messed that all up too. i know she won't like the way i did something and pout about it all day. dad is letting justin come to chrissy and mom's party on sat. but to tell you the truth i don't want him to come. dusty is always giving him a hard time so i don't even want to think about what's going to happen when he gets around dusty, my uncle, my dad, my grandpa, and my grandma all at the same time! he'll probably never want to talk to me again!! dad's been in a pretty good mood w/ me lately but is still in a bad one. he's been sick too and anything but friendly. grandpa is going in for surgery wed. and aunt cindy went into surgery last wed or thur. i think. i hope she's doing better! i'm not sure what grandpa's going in for but i hope he'll be okay too. this whole worrying about everything is going to have to stop because it's making me feel horrible. i've made a promise to myself to stop being so nosey all the time. i'm always wanting to know something about everyone so i'm gonna try to stop asking so many questions and getting into other peoples' business. how that's going to work...i'm not sure but...it's worth a try. i got another call from an unexpected person today. i swear if it's not one guy i totally obsessed over it's another! they are a part of my past and that is where i would like to keep them. the only problem is they don't want to seem to stay there. i have been hurt way too much and don't feel like going through it again. i've got my hands full with the whole justin and levi thing. (although i wonder if me and justin broke up if levi would ever actually go out with me.)  i really really don't need to add any more. okay i think i've bored you enough and this sounds stupid enough so i'm gonna end if here. i'll add more later. night."

"event","why can't any one every tell me what's wrong and what they are planning. i'm always the last to know! levi was acting really weird in fourth block and i asked him what was wrong and all he would tell me was ""Just thinking"" so I asked what about and he was like no. The only thing I could get out of him was that what he was planning to do about his problem would be something I wouldn't like and that scares the shit out of me! I know he wants to move and I think that's what he's planning on doing soon. I don't want him to at all! He might not believe it but i care about him a lot and i don't want to lose him. i've lost too many guys i'm close to and the sucky part about this is that i've never been extremely close to him. he won't let me get close. he told me today he doesn't want to get hurt again he doesn't want to be put through all of it again. he told me i'd never understand. at that he's wrong and if he'd open up with me and talk to me he would know that. i've been hurt more then i'd like to remember and if you were to ask any of my friends they'd tell you i'm horrible with commitment. i'm scared to death of being hurt and usually try to hurt them before they can me. the first time we went out it wasn't for very long but he knew me so well. and he was willing to do just about anything for me. that scared me. when i broke up with him i told him i was scared of him physically but i have to admit that i wasn't. it's true that he reminds me of my dad and that's not the best thing but he didn't scare me the way i would be if i thought he was going to hit me. i fell for him harder then most and that's what scared me. i knew that if anyone that was close could hurt me it was him. And now i'm stuck between him and Justin and i don't know what to do. Justin is great really really great but i still wonder all the time what would happen if i was with levi. ugh! i hate not knowing what to do. i guess i'll end here. if anyone has any suggestions please email me or leave a comment or something."

"event","omg! i told everyone this would happen! no one believed me they were just all like no it won't don't worry about it it's not your problem. but it is because it is happening to a friend. he had to ask her. he just had to! omg! then she doesn't even have the fucking guts to break up w/ him! she lives and uses people (especially him) and he goes ahead and does it! i can't believe it! terry is now living with megan! we met and we clicked then he hurt me. then being the stupid fucking idiot i am let him back in my life and guess what?! he hurts me again! he can't even fucking talk to me any more but he doesn't care. he's happy and that's all that matters to him. although that's what i've wanted but i'm still pissed about the whole thing. Do you know what it feels like to want someone you cannot have then you get your heart ripped out and torn and stomped on and you STILL want that person? that feeling is one of the worst in the world. It's a broken heart from a broken love. I still love him! i wish with everything in me that i didn't. after all of the shit he's pulled with me and after everything we've been through and done and said and felt he does it to me again. but if it comes to it again i want all of you to stop me. i don't want to be hurt again. i don't want to go through all of it. i told you everyone i get really close to i lose! he knew everything about me everything i felt. i was more comfortable telling him some stuff i wasn't comfortable telling anyone else. i trusted him fully and he does that. i talked to jacob the other day too. last time we talked his stupid g/f hung up on me. i want nothing to do with him either. mom's still hurting. she's gettin worse. that's the worst part of life right now. it's hard to see your mom cry because of pain while knowing you cannot do anything about it; do nothing to help. and tyler i won't tell any one about that kind of stuff but do not and i mean DO NOT threaten me about my dad. i will kick your fucking ass. you don't know everything and if you were to ever tell ne one about what you do know i would be dead, literally. you don't know him or what he's like he would rather have revenge then to see me happy. and mary wtf is your problem. i asked you to talk to the person sandy liked instead you told everyone about her crush on him except HIM. that's really low. Sandy wouldn't do that to you and neither would i. i even convinced sandy that she could trust you. she thought you would do exactly what you did but i told her you would never do something like that. guess i was wrong. i'll end it here. i've complained enough"

"event","everything is just so weird. everything is always so weird. everything is just so...i don't know...confusing and mixed up. I haven't talked to a certain person for I don't know how long. I have such strong feelings for him. I have for a really long time but now we don't talk at all. It's happened before and we promised ourselves and eachother that it wouldn't happen again but it has. It seems like he doesn't want to talk to me ever again. We've been through so much and to feel like this makes me feel like he didn't care about any thing between us at all. He was my first kiss, first love, first guy that actually meant something to me but I feel like i had no impact or importance in his life whatsoever. it seems like everyone is going through something but their's is so much more important. I never know how to help. I always seem to bother people when I try to help. Then I find out my boyfriend is going through some really serious stuff but didn't want to tell me because he was afraid i would break up with him. He finally told me after one of my best friends (which he told and not me!) finally convinced him to tell me. It just hurt so much that he was going through this stuff that I didn't know, and that he thought he couldn't tell me. Mom and Dad have found some stuff out about him that I didn't even know and I don't even know if it is true. They won't tell me everything they know or who their ""source"" is. It just....hurts. Then there's Levi. I have strong feelings for him but things are just weird between us. I feel so close to him but we're really not that close. On top of that I have my stupid fear of commitment of being hurt and left behind. Everyone I've ever gotten close to has ""disappeared"" one way or another. Now, every time someone gets too close I either find a way to push them away or I just wait cuz I know it'll happen. I hate it. I seriously don't know what to do. Things just don't make sense. Things are going actually semi good with Justin and I'm really really happy with him and Dad's been in a really really good mood lately. He didn't even ground me for my grades! Yet I'm sitting here typing this and crying. I don't know why though. I think I'm going to end it here."

We decided to go and talk. none of my friend's lk him but i do so it doesn't bother me. well they got scared that he was going to hurt me when we left. They think i'm a freaking idiot that can't take care of herself. if i thought he was ever going to hurt me then i would never talk to him again. i feel safer w/ him then w/ some of the other people i hang out with and talk to. i love him so much i would never be able to explain it or even try to show it. no one knows exactly what we've been through and as i've said before no one ever will. it was nice that they were worried but i didn't need a call every 5 minutes. i knew what i was doing. i don't need a babysitter. i'm tired of doing every thing to please every one else. every thing i do and say is revolved around everyone else. friday night i did for me but it still ended in me apologizing for nothing. i have to make sure everything i do is what they want and what they think is the right thing to do. lately i've felt lk all i have to do is breath wrong and some one's mad at me. people are going through so much right now. besides their problems they have to deal with everyone elses. i think that's the main problem. by the way i hope that everyone's problems get better. especially a certain person. u need to relax and stop being so stressed. i'm always here to help you so just talk to me. even if it's painful i'm here and u can use me to help afterwards too. that's the end to this one.

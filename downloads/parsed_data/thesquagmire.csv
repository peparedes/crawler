i have continued to work through the close of grease which was a pain in the ass but i have had money i took the end of last week off because my parents were out of town and i knew there was no way in hell i would be getting up so there were many party nights which were drunken ones and lots of good times im gonna work through the school year which will be hell

"event","dang so i have wanted to shoot myself like for the past week b/c of my fair lady biggest cluster fuck ever but tonight went decent i am the asm who can never be on headset because we do not have enough crew members so i have to help with everything half of my crew will be missing half of the shows but nick will be helping after this first weekend which is why i get ten dollars for giving him specail favors and deerhead will be coming in tomorrow night and hopefully he can make all the shows from here on out if not fuck me in the ass but im glad nick and andrew are both doing it because i will not have to go completely crazy everynight tonight the bar plug got stuck and i had my back up against a leg on a platform the orchastrea sits on and my feet and heands pushing on the plug and the mother fucker would budge but not get unstuck what is weird is that the top of the plug got stuck but we got the rest unstuck i was about to shit myself b/c we had like two or three mintues and we had a pretty big audience for a preview night and yea but then somehow we got it unstuck and it was good and i about shat myself in relief but yea it will be good i think we finally are getting shit together now i just have to make new shift sheets so they can actually serve a purpose and figure out how to make all this work with all the people coming and going in and out of the show but it will be good 

come see my fair lady we open feb 24th and close like march 18th i believe but come because it will be good even if i kill myself the show still will go on it is ""well worth the money it is to go see it"" as some cute little old couple said as they were walking out of the hallway but yea come bitches and see me so we can fuck till dawn and work the corner and s some d yea im out bitch"

"event","dang thanks to my collin boo for walking lake mirr with me and walking/jogging lake hollingsworth with me you know how we keep it gangsta i love how i hacked up a bunch of flem that tasted like nicotine anyways i

it really sucks that he will have to leave in may or june it just seems like everyone i get really close too leaves or moves on to ""better things"" but this one takes the cake i think and everytime i think about it i just want to curl up in a ball and pretend its not happening i dunno im so happy for him because its an amazing opportunity and if i had it i would jump on it too but it just really sucks to know he will be gone so soon i think its because he wasnt a friend really he was more a part of my family than anything else and i was like his mom sometimes but i love him and it just sucks that hes going but im proud of him im think he doesnt know how proud of him i am but i just dont know how to put it into words but at the same time im also concerned because he doesnt always make the best choices but i hope if ive been able to help with anything it was how to learn from your mistakes even if it takes a couple of times because we are not all perfect but i believe he has learned that at least i hope so i dunno i just feel so alone so helpless..."

"event","so yea fernando is a cunt because they are going to gainsville this weekend and he just bitched at me because im not going when the frist time my mom asked me i was like i really dont want to go but i still get bitched at for ""wating to the last minute to decide if im going or not"" and he bitched about how we have to pay for the dog place even though im staying when i told them before they made reservations to see if there was a charge if they were cancelled and he is talking to the cop across the street tomorrow and he is hiring some private security agent to watch the house 24/7 and anyone that comes to the house besides me will get arrested because ""i dont trust you i never have"" even before i gave him no reason to doubt me he did any way and he said ""im not dumb like your mother i know what you and your friends do ive been around fourty years longer than you and i am not dumb enough to let you get away with things that your mother does"" and he still is hiring the security even if i were to give him my key to the house because ""ive broken into the house before"" well i dont really consider it being broken into when i know i didnt have a key and i left my window unlocked for a reason and then he was like are we clear and i was like yea and he kept going on about it and i was like fernando i understood you and i told you that you dont have to keep telling me and he was like your just a smartass and i was like how am i being a smart ass and in my head i was think well if you werent A FUCKING DRUNK CUNT i wouldnt have to tell you that you already told me soemthing 20 times and he was all in my face the whole time and of course he was talking shit about my mom and she didnt fucking say anything because shes passive as all hell and she isnt willing to stand up for herself or her kids but then again why am i suprised when has she ever oh wait she hasnt oh but of course i am the bad person because i dont want to go on a trip that i have no intrest in going on because they are gonna be at some seminar shit the whole time and id be on my ass in a hotel room instead of at home and fernando also said that i was wasteing his money by staying here when its his choice to hire that security person anyway so after this all happened i climbed in the attic and got my suitcase to pack because he said that when they leave tomorrow i leave and i told him it was because i had to much work to do this weekend and he was like i dont want your bullshit answers so here is what is gonna happen blah blah blah and i was just thinking well if i could say i just dont want to go i would still get bitched at so i thought if i told you this you wouldnt oh but wait you always have to bitch about something whether it be how im a failure and am never gonna go anywhere in life or how my friends are the biggest group of losers (oh but wait he loses them certain days but he denys ever saying that when he starts bitching about it and i bring that up because he is always drunk and cant remember anything he says) or how im gonna have to buy a new car because i drive to much when i drive less in the car i have now than i did in my nissan or everything thats anything but once again why do i seemed so suprised that this fucked up faimly is running around in circles oh maybe it could be the ""im gonna stop drinking i promise"" or ""things will be diffierent this time"" or any other lame ass excuse that he uses to get my mom to let him back in when she didnt even kick him out in the first place he left on his own fucking free will so basicly i am not allowed to be at my house all weeekend and i have to have all my shit with me tomorrow when they leave and i hate this shit im over it im fucking over it at times like this i wanna kill my self and have a hitman kill my father but life is fucking peachy keen when is it not ill just got to school tomorrow and put on my fake fucking smile and pretend to be happy for one more fucking pointless day of my life but thats nothing new such a fucking waste of good air but i love how im such a bad kid even though ive been clean almost a fucking year but no that doesnt count for anything because it was so fucking easy wasnt it oh wait it wasnt it still isnt i hate this shit so much i fucking hate it and jared give my goddamn video game to chelsea so she can give it to me and on a side note maybe you should take into consideration that fucking five page letter i wrote for you you fucking asshole and you sat there and told me you fucking cared but you have yet to show it or even attempted to show it so you know what fuck you im sick of playing your little mind games and im for real so once i get my video game back i really hope you have a swell life and i hope everything turns out they way you want it too and i really mean taht im not trying to be a bitch about that i honestly do and that comes from my heart i saw richie to day and chilled with collin for like an hour and saw bethany for a bit so now that im done bitching and being a cunt everyone have a swell fucking evening"

it was good to see chelsea tonight ive missed her

nichole makes me laugh so hard like when she walks in the green room is like dang it my biti bug and jumps on top of you or when she cant make copies i love her so much

i love my amber because we just go back like that and we got to chill tonight and it was amazing 

it was really good to see alex t. and bethany they makes me laugh so much and in a way i was glad to see that alex really hadnt changed that much because i dunno i fell in love with his crazy ass getting all philosophical all the time when we were tight like that and i miss that and i love that he pays his child support ;)

i love storm like i love your mom because he is so fucking funny you cant not love him and i love the fact that he knows the most random fucking shit ever 

it was so amazing to see ben ive missed him so much i just cant explain it because when i walked in a room and saw his face light up it just makes you feel so loved and the fact that he didnt want to stop hugging me like he didnt want to let go i dunno it just makes you feel like someone truly cares about you and i think that is why i love him so much even and he is also a crazy bitch"

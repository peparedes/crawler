"event","School is coo'.
You might be coo'.
But not as coo' as me.

Everything hasn't been going so well. :(
Some (supposedly and I believe it because of the way he acts around me) perverted, immature kid has the job i've had my heart on. I confronted Cory about it. He switched his story. First it was that I evdently didn't put sound as number 1 (altho I believe I heard Joe Wells put lighting as two and he still got it...) so I confront him about it and ha, changed his story. Now it was that his wife and himself wanted me around more. Aww how fucking not cute. 
Someone said Cory gave it because Kevin Papa was half-deaf and what not...err, wouldn't that be a form of favoritism? That's some hardcore CRAP.
Because Kevin's dad owns a radio station? Okay, Let's say my dad was a surgeon, does that make me a surgeon? No, didn't think so. It's different? Not so much. Sound heads on Broadway can probably make as much as a first year surgeon. Difficulty? same, just depends on how you look at it.

the first general meeting. most of the things students said, not needed. Some where just sucking up. Like a vacum cleaner. And that Baley whale? Yeah, don't like her. I agree with Bunny. Freshman this year are worthless. Half of them are on my bad list. Some of them are on my stab list. :) But I like the guy freshman already. They are cute and non-toxic! Teehehe!

School is hard. Mrhhhh...."

I wish I had something insightful and magical as Michele's latest entry (check it out...) but atlas, I do not. I could always inform of politics but who shall truely listen and do something about our withering government? Every empire has its rise and fall, it is inevitable.
The word delete was not common in the english language until computers came about and changed this. We should praise computers.
Next year, the very chance I get I'ma going to try and change a policy. All officers must take the theatre class. I think that isn't necessary. And you know me, the effienct bee. I hope you all understand. I rather not show up my defense now. It'd spoil the shock of faces. I come fully prepared and shall fight until the bitter end. 
I think I shall love Acl. History because I love debating! Ah! ::dances:: Debating works both ways with me, you learn useful facts while trying to lie out of your ass to make the other feel like complete shit. 
I hear Yale is one of the hardest ivy league schools to get into. And again, I hear the CIA is very difficult to get into. So I see why I need affirmative action, this is the only slim chance I have to get myself into Yale. If I get into it (since it's such a grand, fritzy school) my relatives have promised to help me out (although, that could mean like a $1 or something). 
Well, I had more then I originally thought I had to say. I'm going to sleep. Bye."

"event","I went and helped out with booth again. I loved it so. What's your drive?
 I hope I get an office! I don't think I did though, I wish i did. :: sighs ::. Politics. I really did think I was qualified for the position of secretary. I dunno, am I a people person? :P
I couldn't go to the concert thingy to help Machine out. My brother has a broken arm, his right one. He can't write very well so he acts like he can't do shit. ""Mom, hand me my balloon!"" (He got ""get well soon"" balloons""...), ""Jess, I need you to give me the remote!"" (Like he can't get up! It's your stupid arm!), etc. So today he wants me to WRITE his homework for him. Okay, I can understand typing. I know it'll take you a while so out of the kindness of my heart, sure. But write for him? No! He needs to learn how to write with his left hand because no one is going to write for him in school! He acts like a child! A poor, helpless child. Psh, I'm not falling for that. Sure, I'll help you do things you need help with but get the remote because suddenly thanks to that broken arm, you can't walk a stride to get it...right. 
Bob came over. My brother listens to Bob. He tells my mom and me to shut up but to Bob? Noooo he listens! WHA??!?!?! I just don't get it...:: swoons :: 

Is your day going dandy?"

"event","Once upon a time, There were three little pigs. There was Curly. He was the oldest. There was Wurly. He was the smartest. And then, there was Flo. She was the favorite pig. Their mother loved Flo the best. Curly, Wurly, and Flo lived with their mother in a high-rise apartment building in New York City. Their apartment was on the 75th floor. The pigs didn't mind this because there was an elevator that opened right in front of their apartment door. It was on the days that their elevator wasn't working, that the pigs suffered. Their little hoofs would be aching by the time they reached their apartment. Their mother would have to have little hoof baths waiting for her three little pigs when they finally reached the top. Of course, Flo always got the warmest hoof bath because she was their mother's favorite.
     One day, Mama Pig sent the three pigs to the store to buy apples for their dinner. She gave them a list of items that she needed. She also gave them their allowance, and she told them that they could buy their favorite candy which they would eat for their dessert. The three pigs put on their jackets (it was winter). They put on their gloves and scarves. Next, it was time to put on their boots. Curly slipped on his bright red leather boots over his red and yellow polka dot socks. Wurly, being the most intelligent, slipped on his waterproof, fully lined boots over his white socks. Curly and  Wurly were ready and waiting for their sister. She could not find her boots. 
     ""Curly and Wurly,"" she said,""have you seen my boots?""
     Curly and Wurly looked at each other and then they looked at their sister. ""I'll tell you where they are,"" said Wurly,""if you'll give us your allowance to hold while you go and get them.""
     ""Okay,"" agreed Flo as she handed the boys her allowance.
     ""There are your boots, over there,"" said Curly.
     ""Where?"" asked Flo suspiciously.
     ""Over there!"" squealed the boys as they pointed to the window in their living room. ""They're over there behind that curtain."" 
     Flo slowly walked toward the window. The boys followed closely behind their sister. Just as she reached the window, Curly opened the window and Wurly pushed Flo through. Curly and Wurly squealed with delight as they're sister fell 75 floors. Curly and Wurly were thrilled that their plan worked. They were rid of Flo and they had her money! Luckily for Flo, she landed on a huge snow pile and was not hurt. Her brothers were not so fortunate.
     Mama Pig heard the commotion, ran into the living room and, when she realized what they had done, sent the boys to live with their Uncle Oscar Mayer. Uncle Oscar always knew what to do with bad little pigs. The boys protested. They were just doing Flo a favor by helping her find her boots; it wasn't their fault that she was clumsy. But Mama would not listen to their excuses and off they went to Uncle Oscar's.
     Flo and Mama Pig still live on the 75th floor to the apartment building in New York City, and there very happy there. Now Flo gets her brothers' allowance since they're not there."

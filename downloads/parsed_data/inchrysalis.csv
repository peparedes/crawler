"event","&quot;With so few creatures around, finding a mate is as much of a problem as finding food. Some animals have come up with ingenious solutions: when the male deep-sea angler fish bumps into a female, he uses his lips to remain attached to her as a parasite. &quot;It's a kiss that lasts the rest of his life,&quot; says Dr John Copley, a deep-sea biologist from Southampton's National Oceanography Centre. &quot;After that he no longer feeds, but hooks up to her blood supply.&quot;&quot;"

I think there is a baby bird stuck in my fishtank. Actually, the filter is making this weird squeak that makes it sound that way. 

I am writing my statement of educational goals on my ESF application. You want to proofread it? Fran? 

I think I am going to syracuse tomorrow, hopefully spend the evening with my cousin. Then I will journey to Ithaca for sat & sun probably. I want to see my dogs and my old boss and get in the hot tub.

Tonight my rifle is doing a home based recording, in which we will be relying on no one else to get these songs down. I geeked out yesterday and made a google calendar for my rifle telling us when every open mic night is ever. We played the cubbyhole on tuesday and hopefully will again next tuesday. 

Maybe my fish learned how to chirp?"

Then I wished that there was an easy solution to me getting out of work when the weather is bad, and then later on Donna my co-worker said if I take her saturday shifts every other weekend she will work for me whenever it snows. 

Yesterday I wished that Jack would clear his schedule to hang out with me, and then today his school got cancelled and the bus to his dads house for the weekend also got cancelled and he just called to hang with me.

I got the job at an animal hospital in dover? I am on a two week trial basis. I will work hard and they will wonder where I have been all their working lives and hire me. I hope that watching animal surgery does not ruin my insides. I am really good at working with animals and I love it. So there. Who gets a newer better job in a recession? Shannon does. 

I started reading this book called in praise of slowness. It is appropriate. I am taking yoga classes again and plan on becoming a yoga master. I am signing up for a yoga retreat in costa rica may 09. Want to come? They also offer surfing, spanish and fire poi classes. Its dirt cheap. 

My best friend really let me down this week. He was supposed to come and visit for halloween and cancelled last minute only to make plans to come sunday and monday to record my rifle (the band, not the arm). Then he cancelled REALLY last minute, like when I expected him to pull in my driveway last minute. Not only did I fit my schedule around his visiting, but I also asked two other people to structure their schedules around us recording. And he doesn't even apologize- he says ""I'm sorry I am an indentured servant to my parents"" and I said ""you knew you werent coming yesterday and didnt tell me"" and he says I am making a big deal over nothing. Angry. Sorry I bothered you with my friendship, alex. 

I got good chops playing guitar. My calluses are actually gross theyre so big. 

I met a man worth talking to. He is a writer and well spoken and good at guitar playin. Except he seems indoorsy and drama town usa. We'll see. 

On halloween I dressed up as garth algar and my bff francesca was wayne campbell. It was fucking hysterical. We bowed down to david bowie claiming we were not worthy. Although we forgot about the bohemian rhapsody sing along. 

My vagina is not fixed. For those of you who may not know I had a cold knife cone biopsy to remove a premalignant lesion from my cervix in july. And it is back. Only not as severe. It may go away on its own, or it may become cancerous. We'll see. Send me some cosmic rays of healing, plz. 

Thats all folks."

I am trying to paint more. I have lots of ideas and drawings but I can't concentrate because my rooms a mess. 
So I Started cleaning my room. This is going to be a three week project. Yeah, its that bad. 
I also would like to take and ace my GRE before octobers end. 
My rats have mites and they are hard to get rid of. I am going to try neem oil. They scratch so hard they have scabs. Gross. 
Um, the cops came and took over my job and arrested my boss? Last week. The bank repossessed the inn because my old boss wasn't paying bills. There is also more to the story that I will probably find out in the near future. But my new boss is nice and attractive but he doesn't get it that I am severely overworked and I am the only housekeeper when we should actually have four on staff at all times. He also makes jokes about it being womens work and other slightly misogynistic comments. 
I need a new job. A real job. I am trying. I am applying to be a research analyst in agriculture in Iowa. I am qualified. Moving to iowa would be scary and also awesome.

lolz.

I made surprises for people today. If you're one of those people, anticipate packages in your mailbox. 
Shitty week because I was sick and also was working 12 hour days. But I made enough money to pay march rent. 
Anyone want a 30 gallon fishtank and some fish? 
Today I was at the inn and I was the only one there and got in the hot tub around 2 pm and there was fresh snow on the ground and the sun came out and it was GLORIOUS and then it began to snow and it was also very fantastic and then the sun came out again! odd! but it felt so good to be outside, naked, and happy. 
My friends zac and becky have five baby himalayan kittens and i got to name two of them! Pancake and jupiter! Pancake sort of looks like ET so I call her phone home sometimes. 
Living alone sucks. Just sayin'. I don't actually live alone, I have a roommate and two dogs. but she goes away ALL THE TIME. And having the dogs has been very difficult because I am not allowed to bring them to the inn with me and i have to be at the inn almost 24/7. I feel lonely. I talk to the dogs but they don't talk to me.

And I was also hitting on him in my dream. Double gross. But we waited for the fireworks as it got dark on lawn chairs and there were a couple of teaser fireworks but then nothing for an extraordinary amount of time and suddenly it started getting light outside. Half of the sky was grey and the other half was pink and orange. It wasn't getting light because it was dawn, it was getting light because it was the end of the world. Off in the distance on the hilltops we saw smoke rising and general chaos in mass quantities. I asked Jen and Anjuli what was going on, if we were waging nuclear war and they just told me they didnt know."

I'm driving to California with Xander Bohne on his birthday in january and may/may not come home. I am going to do an internship with the SCA and then find me a farm, co-op, community, and/or homestead that already exists or start one. Maybe get a license to grow cannabis. Califonia is also one of the top researchers for the effects of climate change on biota. And Arnold is pretty sweet. You can do a lot with an Environmental Studies degree."

'Dinosaur trees' heavily guarded
Thousands of rare baby ""dinosaur"" trees have been placed under 24-hour security to protect them before they go on sale.

About 15,000 Wollemi Pine - a tree once thought to have become extinct more than two million years ago - are thriving in a greenhouse in Cornwall.

The trees, which were discovered at a secret location near Sydney in 1994, are now being grown at Kernock Park Plants nursery in Saltash.

The ""crown jewels"" of botany are set to feature at the Chelsea Flower show.

Horticultural expert Tony Russell, who is helping to arrange the Jurassic exhibit, said the discovery of the Wollemi Pine - a fern-like evergreen tree - was ""like finding a living dinosaur"".

Ice age

The trees, discovered by New South Wales national parks and wildlife officer David Noble, are said to be the botanical find of the century.

""They are the crown jewels of the botanical world,"" Mr Russell said.

Before the discovery was made in a now secret and protected location, the only known examples of the tree were fossils dating back 175 million years. 

To save the trees from extinction Wollemi Pine International is spearheading a project to raise saplings from the trees in the wild and make them commercially available across the world.

The money raised will help to protect the secret location from outsiders, as well as fund a research programme to establish how the tree has managed to survive 17 Ice Ages.

The owner of Kernock Plants, Richard Harnett, said in six months, at the end of the Chelsea Show, Wollemi Pines would be available for people to buy for the first time.

It is hoped that this will reduce the risk of uncontrolled exploitation.

The Wollemi Pine can grow up to 130ft (39.6m) high in the wild, with a trunk diameter of more than 3ft (91cm)."

I like when there are parties at my house. Our living room gets really high intensity party, and I get the chill crowd in my room usually. And it is often beautiful and amazing men in here that sing me songs and speak intelligently.

I can't concentrate and I am in love with everyone and everything. The things/people I do choose to concentrate my love on drive me insane. This is not a complaint. I used to think that if I had a superpower I would want infinite wisdom but im not so sure. Being curious is fun and good and fear of the unknown is healthy. I am not afraid of enough, and I also play it safe too much in order to not be scared. I think that if i could have a superpower i would ask for x-ray vision. hey, im a horny teenager. what do you expect.

"event","I don't know. This may be a sign of growing up, but getting drunk and fucking isn't all there is to life. I'm kind of sick of people who play really intense drinking games, get tanked to the point where they don't remember a damn thing, disrespect other people and their property, and for the entire next day or next few days have nothing better to talk about than how drunk they got that night.
On weekends I would much rather relax with my friends and do something worthwhile. It still may involve alcohol, but it doesn't revolve around alcohol. I want to hang out with real people with real things to say. Not people who get drunk to drown their problems away and detach themselves from the outside world. 
I guess what I'm trying to say, is that Andy, Jamie, Caitlinn and Alex, I love you and miss you. 
You fit in with people who like to do the same things that you like to do. and those are my people. 
I miss having older friends too. When your in college you are detached from interaction with children and adults outside of the classroom. I need to babysit and have friends who live in Ithaca and don't go to college. I need some variety."

"event","I've been on  a down-swing for a long time. I feel like im finally coming back up. the only things ive had to converse about was how much i hated my job and events that ive been looking forward to in the future. i read the newspaper but dont read the newspaper. events outside of my brain have been insignificant. events inside my brain have been insignificant. ive been bored, and boring. where did this come from? coming out of an amphetamine dependency, probably. and no motivation due to unemployedness and out of schoolness. i wish i had a good job this summer. something i wanted to do. next summer is beautiful adventures in australia. this summer= poo poo. but i take full responsibility for not getting what i wanted out of my summer. i havnt been motivated or ambitious in any way. my creativity stunted. ive written one song and  painted a box at the beginning of summer and nothing since. i wrote a few beautiful pieces out of strange inspirations but they werent enough. I didnt even take advantage of having the studio. i got one good track out of the deal and learned nothing from my professor that i didnt already know. highlight of this summer was varneys. and an incredible highlight at that, because it is still an amazing mystery unfolding. other highlight of the summer are the two most amazing friends ive ever had. These two men make me feel at home and give me something to look forward to always, my lifemates, amazing men. I just wish I could have been more around mentally to bond with them. ive been idle. im moving to ithaca & start my job on august first. not the seventh as planned. so minus the minnesota week ill be home for about ten more days of summer. ive gotta make those last ten days count boys. we must have a phenomenal week. I cant come home a lot this semester. ive gotta milk ithaca for what its worth because after december im not going to be there for a lonnnggg time. best case scenario is that i move to ithaca and the location change gives me the opportunity to keep motivated and active and maybe my brain will start working again. i miss it. 
Im working for nypirg again in ithaca. this time i want to get something out of it. i want the strength to not only handle rejection, but to reject rejection. if someone doesnt care about the issue im pressing i want to make them care through use of my language. its manipulative. but its the only way it gets done. theres a lot of ways marketing companies manipulate you to buy their products, but not enough emphasis is given on the ways to get people to put their money in places that they will be helping their communities and helping the world. 
and in the fall im a remp rep, which means i teach people how glorious reusing and recycling is. makes me feel good. and I am also a classroom tech for the information technology services at IC. Which means i get paid a nice chunk of change to do my homework and test out smart classrooms periodically and document broken equipment. sweet. and my classes are amazing. im taking a class called fostering sustainable communities. hey, shannon, what are you devoting your life to? Fostering a sustainable community. Sweet! 
So I've much to look forward to, but not enough in the now and as of late. I havnt grown in three months. I feel like im wasting time. Ever wonder what goes on in my mind all day? Let me tell you, My mind goes ""hey hot guy... cool look at that bug... how do goldfish swim like that... man i hare making phonecalls... man that man is beautiful... i hate making phonecalls."" repeat. repeat. im bored! 
Shannon. Go work a job that feels good no matter how challenging, read a god damn book and get something out of it, stop staring at the goldfish and go outside. the world is waiting."

"event","Given all of the environmental problems we have discussed this semester, and the gravity of the global environmental situation, under what if any circumstances would you consider it legitimate for someone (not necessarily yourself) to engage in destructive activities for environmental protection. Consider some of the following as possible entry points into the discussion: 
1.) Letting loose animals (such as primates) being held under deplorable conditions for research purposes
2.) Destroying a field of genetically modified corn
3.) Spiking trees in an old growth forest slated to be cut by a private timber company
4.) Setting a fire in the headquarters of a large multinational corporation engaged in environmentally destructive activities
5.) Burning several dozen SUV's in an automobile dealer lot
6.) Burning down a housing development to send a statement about ""urban sprawl""

"event","Thank goodness, gas prices are finally rising!
Although I am the poorest I have ever been in my life, gas prices are finally getting people thinking.
The true cost of gasoline is $15 per gallon. Do you believe it? do you want to know why? 
1.) Subsidies pay for military protection of middle eastern oil
2.) environmental, health and social costs. (medical bills from air pollution poisoning, ground water contamination, cleaning up oil spills, noise pollution, time in traffic, etc.) 

Do you know how fast our ice caps are melting? Do you know how many people are scared for our future? our IMMEDIATE future?
Global Climate Change made the cover of Time magazin. The United States is the only country affluent enough to give a shit but our media is still failing to cover THE most important issue of our time. This is the biggest problem the civilized world has ever faced and we are STILL BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. Oceans are rising at an estimated 3 feet in 50 years. thats a big deal. islands are going to be underwater, and people are going to need to be relocated and natural resources are going to be extremely scarce. and when havnt we fought wars over natural resources? can you tell me? and we are only increasing our fossil fuel use so its going to rise faster. and oceans hold heat, therefore it will take 25-50 years to reverse the damage if we stop emitting greenhouse gases TOMORROW. and i dont even want to get into how climate change will affect our weather patters. all im gonna say is hurricanes every day and london will turn into a glacier.

FUCK FOSSIL FUELS

"event","Dear F'06 Walkabout applicants,

At the present time, we only have 9 applicants for this program, and as 
you know, we are supposed to have a minimum of 12 in order to run the 
program. We are going to ask our Australian partners if they will agree 
to run the program with fewer students, but it is likely we will have to 
cancel the Walkabout for the fall semester.


no kangaroos. no koalas. no ferns the size of houses. no accents. no rainforests. no tasmanian devils. no spiders the size of dogs. no coral reefs. no visiting richard in LA. no 24 hour plane rides. 
and the biggest heartbreaker, no guiding eyes dog. 
and also, no place to live next semester. anyone in ithaca got a couch?

I'm not really into planning things out, but you all know how long I have been planning on going to australia and how much I have been looking forward to it. I planned out my degree and my dog around this  program. I felt so good about all the ideas I had in my mind about what the next year was going to be like. Now I feel so lost.

Should I take the fall off? and go to australia in the spring? Should I do a different australia program for the fall? I have no clue and have two days to decide. 

I'll be crying myself to sleep if you need me."

And all today i was giddy with tired creative energy but it wore off and now I am a zombie and i still have work to do! no fun! 
but my goldfish lived! I was worried, I left them alone for ten days. I hope they didn't get too lonely. 
Spring break was good. but god dammit john bryan i miss you. I miss talking to you. I miss working with you.  I miss making fun of your scene belts and laughing with you over the most ridiculous things- like gelatinous globules of spam in space and your prank calls and themed parties and i like your beard you remind me of my dad! and my dads awesome! I'd like to see you smile more as well. Quit selux already youre a freelance genious and its more fun anyway. 
I don't miss home as much anymore. I miss my grandma though.
Its not about location anymore, its about the people that I miss. and everyones scattered about the northeast. 
makes for some good road trip stories, though. 
I owe massacccchussetts a visit. Either north hampton or boston. I'll probably flip a coin. or do both. if someone else drives. 
Had some really good conversations with really good people about what we want to do with our lives. I wish to death I didnt have to sleep ever that i could just always be awake doing something. Naps are real nice. but I wish my body didnt need any more than 4 hours of sleep per day.

stop talking to me

i know im pretty late on the new years post but its been an absolutely insane month of january. 
In 2k5 I met the jersey boys, made a lot of amazing recordings, I got a degree, I got arrested, I learned a lot about myself, Im going to a private school and i can still afford my car and eating, Ive made some awesome friends,  Im thoroughly enjoying college, I have a pretty good rough outline of what I want to accomplish in this lifetime, I have plans to go to ecuador and australia in 2k6 and I already went to antigua. I might go again next year. 
So ive brought in the new year with a big fucking bang. the last six days have been forgettable. In the best way possible. 
I saw derek trucks band last night. I was in such a zone. At the beginning I thought they were so simple and   I was bored to tears then it just kind of clicked, i think it was the flute, but i got into it and it was very enjoyable and if they play your town i reccommend that you go. and trip. do it. 
Im getting a dog when I come home from australia. I'm getting a puppy and Im going to train it to be a seeing eye dog. Anyone want to live with me & my dog this time next year? I kind of like the idea, that the absolute only thing in the universe that scares me about the future is not having a place to live with the dog or not being able to find a dogsitter. But, the college supports raising guiding eyes dogs and theyre going to hook me up with housing. But still, it worries. but no worries. 
im late.

come visit ithaca, I highly reccommend that you come. anyone, come."

"event","so we had a swim meet last night and we won!! YAY! it came down to me in the last race... but this is how the night when for me...

I first swam the 200 free which i have never swam before and i did really good and stayed in front of the girl in the lane next to me. well the last 25 she sped up and caught up to me and she touched me out... she beat me by like .25 second... i finished with my arm bent and not extended but it was the first time i have swam that enent and according to val, i did good for that being my first time... so i could have beat her but oh well... Next.. then i did the 100 fly like i have been doing. i was behind the girl in the lane right next to me the hole time until the last 25 where i sped up and caught up to her (sound farmilular?) well i took an extra stroke insttead of just a kick but i came really close to her... she beat me by like .3 second.... BUT i dropped 4 seconds on it so i was still proud of myself. After that i was in the 200 free relay (4 swimmers swim a 50 each) so i was the anchor (last oout of the 4 to go) i kicked ass and went into the water behind lane 5 ( i was in lane 2) and i touched her out!!!! it was sweet. i got a personal best time in that also. so when i got out of the pool from doing that val came up to me and told me that she was going to switch me out of the C relay (klowest relay) to the A relay (highest) and i was all freaking out ,,, oh btw this is for the 400 relay that was still to come.... and so i was the anchor for that.. katie johnson who was in my relay got in my head and her, Chris carter and Tori Laduke all got me a huge lead going to in the last 1-- that i had to do. i ended up going like a 1:09 and thats like 15 second sbetter than my other times!!!!! it was awesome.. that was the race it came down to and i was so far ahead of all the all lanes and i won it adn it was awesome.. i coudln't have done it without the support of my relay mates.. and the fact that they got me such a huge lead from the get go. so we finally won a meet!!!! LOOK OUT EATON RAPIDS!!! so yea.... ok so now time for the stuff that is happening today...

We had morning practice this morning.... it was pretty easy. and at 3 we have swim practice... its like 3-6 which is like 45 mins longer than what we normally swim after school. after practice i am going to Jackson Northwest's homecominng game with matt... it should be fun and i will be meeting some of his friends... i'm excited. then tomorrow i am going to babysit from 8am- 2pm and then go to a church thing with matt... can't wait then he will be spending the night here at my house so that he can go to church with me on sunday morning.... this is going to eb a great weekend.. well i'll post how things go tomorrow or tonight which ever is better... c ya bitches...

then we went to bed about 2am... then i got up and we went to his church where there is only him adn another boy named cody in his youth group. nice kid but i still think matt is better... anyways... so sunday scool class was fun. then we went to church service where he runs teh sound board and we flirted the whole time it really wasn't even like church.. then we went back to his house and watched more movies, took more cute pictures and had lunch then fianlly we fell alseep on him couch...

"event","So i have a swim meet tomorrow... i'm swimming 200 medley relay, 50 free, 100 fly and 200 free relay... over all i am swimming 250 yards sprint and then just a warm up and a warm down. I'm so excited but at the same time i am also scared. So tomorrow matt is going to my swim meet.. i think that might make me want to swim better.... to like show off or something. :p.... anyways.. that brings me to another point... i hate when people say... ""youre too young to no what love is"" that really makes me upset.... because everyone is different and some people are more mature than others. just like some people have better grades and some people have better social skills and some people get feelings for others and believe that they are real. and to the whole ""all highschool sweethearts break up and get divorced..."" thats bullshit because there are those who are still married/have been married for along time and again that brings me to the everyone is different... ahhhh it just pisses me off when people are judging me... i have strong feelings for Matt and nothing anyone says will change that unless its him and then maybe it will change that. who cares how long we have been dating and who cares how long we have known each other... we have a connection and i want to be with him as so does he. if you have a problem to that go ahead and tell me and i'll listen but that doesn't mean that it is going to mean anything to me. and another thing. if you think we are spending to much time together just tell me to my face and then we can talk about it. i love hanging out with my friends and i love hanging out with matt... just tell me if something is bothering you come to me.. just don't be all getting mad at me for saying something about my bf... he is mine and he means so much to me and if none of you could tell, i'm the happiest i have been in a long time.... and when ever i am with him i feel safe and i feel like i as a person matter and he makes me feel beautiful. the first guy to have ever told me that i am beautiful. its just wonderful... he makes me feel whole and he makes me feel like i finally have found what i have been looking for... it seems to make sense why things with eddie didn't work out because i am happy and if i was still with eddie i woudl be sad and crying all the time and always getting let down but i don't think i will ever feel that way with matt. everything right now seems right... and i'm sry if you think that is stupid but i don't really care.... goodnight"

The trumpet sectional today was a blow. and for all those people who just didn't show up... you are pethedic. i understand taht everyone can't come to every sectional. thats why we say call when you can't come so maybe we can just cancelle it so the people who can come don't make a wasted trip. i am just about to give up and the first person i hear complaning about how bad we are i'm gonna blow up at unless you have been there and been through the practices... jim was at the one today and he left to what it seemed a lil pissed... well i'm done with this. if you don't wanna be there just because yo0u have better things to do then quit... thats all i have to say... well bye

"event","who said we don't want all the section leaders being first part? the section leaders aren't only there to be good leaders and to keep people in line, they are also suppose to teach each other the parts and as for this year we have decided to get bous to give the section leaders each part so taht we all (SL) learn each part so that we can help more... i don't think the section leaders on each part is a good idea.... no offense but i don't feel; that maggie or alys shoudl ever be section leaders because its not your naturla instermet (bad word i no) it may be your marching insturment but i don't think it woudl be fair to have you as a section leader when you don't put all your time in it. and tahts not coming out right but w/e..... i feel the way she does section leadres right now is the way to do it. it shoudl be teh people who qualify both as leaders and players.... i no i got bitchy last year and i was strict and at times i was mean but that was becasue i was sick of you guys not listening and when i yelled you guys finally shut the fuck up... i got so pissed at maggie and janelle that for a period of time i hated both of them.. i woudl have never felt taht way if you were to have listened to me, steven beth and kim. and no one listened to beth so no one can use the excuse that she is a sr and you shoulsd only listen to her becasue there were 4 section leaders not just beth, not jys me and not just steven.... we talked about ways to get you all to keep in line but i tended to verbalize them more becasue i was near teh problem more... beth adn steven if you disagree just tell me.. thats what i felt like... any ways... and james... Ryan Jon and Janelle all say they don't care who section leaders are and taht they aren't going to listen anyways... which is not a good section leader so they don't deserve it.. just to clear that up"

Mo talked to him adn thought he was a cool kid and all... i dunno any more. i don't no what just made me type all that!!! sometimes i just type not thinking about what or why i am typing them. they just come out. its my true deep feelings. this live journal i guess isn't meant to be happy and i tend to type when i am down which might be the best thing for me... then i can look back adn see what really made me over come. i haven't talked about eddie when he made me happy in awhile. but he makes me happy alot. you all jkust tend to hear about the bad thinsg which isn't always taht good. becasue you only no half the story. when the other half is still out there.... i wnat to change myself. i want to become a different person for at least one day just to see what its like. i'm not happy with the person i am right now. and i'm sorry for anything i say that might make you mad or upset... i really am. i sit here crying listening to a song about a guy who is slowly dying and it makes me think more. i think better when i listen to sad music and emo and stuff., i like to be held and be hugged, i love to be told that i am a good person adn that i look really good on some days and i love to just be normal but i'm not. and i am accepting that. and if anyone has a problem with me please don't be a coward and write an anounomus post, just tell me who you are. tahts all i want. i don't want enemies and i don't want people to hate me. but i no that it is gonna happen, so i wanna no why you hate me.. please if you have a problem with me please tell me. i want to change.. and you no what i hate the most.. when my friends make fun of my breats.. yes they are kinda big but why do you all have to make fun of them??? i'm fucking sorry if thats the way i am. i'd big them up for almost anything. they mean nothing to me.... they mean that i'm fat pretty much because ehavier people tend to have bigger breasts.... so in all esence when you make fun of how big my boobs are you make fun of my weight... you might not mean it but w/e.. well i'm done.. all this pressure in my head is killing me and its making my ears hurt really bad... so i am leaving......"

with this knife

i let myself fall into a lie
i let my walls come down
i let myself smile and feel alive
i let my walls come down
no matter how i try i don't know why
you push so far away
you wrapped your hands tight around my heart
and squeezed it full of pain 

with this knife i'll cut out the part of me 
the part that cares for you
with this knife i'll cut out the heart of me
the heart that cares for you

i can't believe the way you took me down
i never saw the pain
coming in a million broken miles
like poison in my veins

(chorus)

the hate and the fear
the nightmares that wake me up
in the tears
the nightmares and (the hate)...

So life was going great, met a great guy that i connect with and that i woudl do anything for. i love being around him. he makes me feel good about myself and he is always making me smile when i am down. i feel i can tell him almost anything UNLESS it comes to my feelings about him. when i want to tell him how i feel i already no his reaction and what if will be. its always the same and i guess that i'm happy for that and happy to have even at least met him. its kinda weird that i can be writing all this stuff to the public but not to him... maybe its just because i in my mind want him to find out because i'm to much of a pussy to tell him myself... anyways so we had a great talk last night about are feelings for each other and i think that he is holding alot back from me. which in itself mkes me feel bad because i told him things that were extremely personal for me, but everyybodies trust is different in each person. i was going down a hard path at the beginging of this year. i was almost at the end of my mind about to go off the cliff and then on my birthday (the worst day so far) i met this guy. we first started talking adn i felt some amazing connection with him. i then decided taht i was going to try to do everything different from then on adn think more possitive. i have been in better moods since him. but i also go through bad moods because i like him so muc (much more than i think he realizes) and i think how i know that something will go wrong because it always does. and nothing went wrong for a long time... now he has his license adn we were planning on hanging out alot more but his parents wont let him drive at night becasue ""he doesn't no how"" (thats what they say) but him living 20 mins away and the car he can use isn't home till 4:30 and sun sets at 7 taht doesn't give tghat much time to hang out... but yet it does... enough time for us to talk to each other... so i again wonder why the hell i am getting so fucking upset over this because its such a stupid little thing to get upset about! i'm being such a baby adn i no t hat... then thinking hard about this... i am leaving for spring break on friday morning adn i wanted to hang out with him one more time before i left because i am afraid taht his feelings for me will start to go away and when i get back he wont be there the same way any more.. i just don;t have teh guts to tell him that. i have so many questions taht no one can answer and i think that those questions are part of my problem....

I have never felt like this about anyone in my life... i have never thought this much about anyone in my life. i bet i am driving my friends insane with all this shit. right now we are just friends and as i can live with this (which i can) i want to be more. but i'm just waiting fo rhim but what if i wait all spring break and get back adn he doens't like me like t aht anymore? what if he started talking to someone else and started feeling the way i feel about him for them? i soemtimes wonder if me not being ms. skinny ever has an effect on why he only wants to be friends? if i was skinnier woudl things be different? i no my friends mean well when they talk to him about me but sometimes i no that it just screws things up more and it probably pushes him away. SO i sit here listening to ""Never Had a Dream COme True"" how much that song makes me think of him and i smile. i think how just being firends is so much better than just not knowing each other at all.. i wonder if maybe i ask him out if ihe woudl say yes because i got up the courage to do it... woudl he just be scared of getting hurt? could he just be scared of liking somebody alot? but then i think i am afraid to ask him and get rejected being afraid of him getting mad at me or something like that.  Part of me wants him to read this entry and part of me wants him to never no these things i have just typed...  why is this so difficult for me???? i ahev liked other guys in the past!!!! i never thought this much or had feelinhgs even close to this. Is he right when he says maybe i like him for the wrong reasons?.... and i just being impaicent??? am i pushing him to be more? i guess i have alot of quetsions i need answered but i ask them then feel that i ave semi good answers for them... i realize that this post is extremely long so i am going to leave now and go sleep or maybe get up the guts to do something about this.... well thank you all for reading this ... hope i didn't bore you to much"

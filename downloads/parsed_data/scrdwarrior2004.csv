"event","im posting this in both livejournals because im not sure if everyone has both lj names.

iv been home for a lil while now.  its gotten me to think of my choices that i have made in life over the past year and half or so and it really makes me wonder did i make the right ones.  some yes and others no.  everyday that im here only makes me want to be gone even more.  i want to run away and escape.  i feel like i made the wrong choice for my future.  it came down to four choices: UNH, UMass, Endicott, and the Army.  so basically school or army.  i shoulda left a year and half ago but i didnt.  i only stayed for one reason.  i asked all my friends what should i do...most told me to do what i feel is right, others told me to stay away from the army so i wouldnt be fighting a war that they didnt believe in.  only one opinion mattered to me.  that opinion said to stay because they were in love with me and they wanted to be with me forever.  so i stayed.  i stayed for her.  the one person in this world that i care about the most, hell more than myself.  i try and try and try but i get nowhere.  if i knew all the way back in highschool it was going to be like this then i woulda been on the first plane down to carolina and the first one to iraq.  i feel like i have no purpose to be here anymore.  why should i fight a losing battle?  why should i go through all the pain to end up with more than what i started.  when i hug her i want to hold her as tight as possible and never let go, her hugs...i dunno, they just dont feel like they have any feeling in them and if they do its not good.  i see her and i think of how beautiful she has gotten since the day that i met her.  i see her eyes and i remember how loving and caring they used to be towards me.  im sick of playing the balme game with her.  im tired of the you did this , you did that game so i did this and that.  im tired of feeling depressed alone and like im missing out on the life of the one that im in love with.  i cannot stand people telling me that its going to be ok , to get over her that the ocean is big and that there is more fish in it.  well guess what in this big vast ocean i found the one fish that i want.  the one thats smile can turn any bad day into the best, the one that gets my heart pumping like no other.  the one that makes me melt inside, the one that i wouldnt mind having see me in my most vulnerable moments.  i loved last year and meeting new people and then having her come up and being proud to say that she is my girlfiend when i introduced them to her.  i had no problem just holding her tight and listening to her sleep.  i loved how goofy she was and how she could always make me laugh when i was trying to be serious.  i loved giving her a massage and just talking for hours.  she was my first, she meant the most, and i would be proud to say that she could be my last.  i remember the days that i used to tell her after an amazing date, kiss, nap, or just for the hell of it that i was going to marry her one day.  i remember her telling me what kind of ring she wanted and how many kids.  when she wanted them, what she wanted to do for the rest of her life.  i always fit into her life goal.  now im lucky if i fit into the people that she will talk to this week.  i thought that i was over her and that i didnst want or need her anymore...then i sobered up and realized that i was wrong.  now id do anything to have her in my life again.

im sorry i hurt you, i didnt mean to.  i meant only to hurt myself.  if we never speak again or see each other again i want you to know that i will love you until my dying day and that you hold a place in my heart that is more special to me than any other.  if i leave without saying goodbye its nothing against you i just dont ever want to say goodbye to the one i love.

its time to fix my mistakes.  in the next couple of months im going to start talking to recruiters.  i hope to leave around the begining of the summer.  i dont see any reason to stay anymore.  maybe one day i will find it or it will find me."

"event","this is my last entry for this livejournal.  im starting fresh and new.  there are some last things i need to say.

dan - if this ever gets to you i forgive you.  its not worth losing our friendship over.
jacque - i love you and im in love with you.  you on the other hand only love me.  the truth hurts but at least we are no longer living a lie.  one day things may work out and we may be friends but now i need to be away from you.  i need to find out who i am and who i want to be.  you are the most importnat person to me even though i cannot show it.  if things ever change in your heart or you mind please let me know.  good luck this year in field hockey im rooting for you.  i love my babycakes always and forever.


anyone who wants to can check out my new liveournal its probably going to be mostly public entries cause i have nothing to hide.  i am not deleting this one on my own so if you want you can go through the archives.  i do not want to forget who i was and where i came from.  http://www.livejournal.com/users/aherodies2day/

"event","i know i didnt do my mission of not updating this thing anymore.  i failed but i dont care anymore because the people who actually care will read this no matter how happy or depressing it actually is.  this have been rough here at school.  i have had little to no motivation to do anything.  i just want to sleep or lay in bed all day.  not being with jacque has taken alot out of me and im trying to change that.  im trying to get myself to the point where this friendship can work and still have hope for the future.  its hard but i have help from an amazing friend, thanks fe.  jacque came up yesterday and stayed till 10 this morning.  she came up so that we culd talk, guess what didnt really happen.  she got here and in true jacque fashion passed ut on my bed for about a half hour.  we then went to wendy's to get food because she is tired of college food.  then went back to the room and made plans for the night.  we wanted to go out with sarah furlong but never got hold of her again so we went to the greens with my roomie and met up with no joke like all of my floor.  we saw some m-towners along the way.  jacque and i took off to find sarah just as she was walking by the greens and invited her over but she had other plans but said that she would stop by.  so we headed back to the party and i know it wasnt anything big or special but it was a nice place to chill out.we ended up going in the backyard and talking to clarence (he lives there and i had a class with him last year) and his g/f.  they were really cool.  after a while we headed back to the room but in now true UNH fashion ran into more merrimack kids.  i found out that the french fucker mark tardiff was at UNH so i called the bastard to see where he was at and we were going to meet up with him later on.  so we made it back to the room and jacque felt really sick so i showed her where the bathroom farthest away from the RA's room was so she could do her thing.  then we got ready for bed and i got a trrashcan ready for her just in case.  we then went to bed.  woke up around 9 this morning and just cuddled as she was in and out of naps.  about 10 she had to leave so i walked her to her car and we said our goodbyes for the time being.  i wish she culda stayed longer but i will take what i can get.

"event","so im designing some merrimack beruit shirts for anyone who would like one...so far i have only designed the back and they should be relatively cheap to get one if i do decide to make them for all who want one. check out the pic and tell me what you think and if you would like one. i am open to suggestions to alter the shirt and i can make customized ones. i havent decided on what to put on the front but i was thinking of putting merrimack beruit written in a circle with the merrimck M in the backgroud with some tomahawks in the foreground.

"event","sitting here alone in my chair
breathing in this cold thick air
the only sound is that of the sorrow in my heart
screaming why did we ever fall apart
the phone is growing webs of dust
you call it but only if you must

and we are back to the same old games
where we fight and scream about each others shames
until one of us leaves in tears to end it
refusing to listen to the others bullshit
im hurting you and youre hurting me
put on your shoes its time to flee

the couch just lay there with our impressions
and blanket is still damp from out last indescretions
your hair tie is left on the table
reminding me that this was no fable
once again im choking up the tears
that have accumulated over the years

and we are back to the same old games
where we fight and scream about each others shames
until one of us leaves in tears to end it
refusing to listen to the others bullshit
im hurting you and youre hurting me
put on your shoes its time to flee

your scent is still on my mind
these things have never been so unkind
i can still feel the wind as you rushed out
it is full of feelings of guilt and doubt
a stray hair is caught in motion by my blue eyes
teasing my emotions of long forgotten goodbyes

and we are back to the same old games
where we fight and scream about each others shames
until one of us leaves in tears to end it
refusing to listen to the others bullshit

"event","sunday was a hard day...i picked up jacque at the airport and then drove her home.  we were supposed to hang out and talk me and her but that got cancelled due to some drunkards being needed to be picked up.  i was pissed because i got ditched for them once again but o well.  i went home and did some stuff, looked at pics online for tattoo ideas then headed over to jacques.  it was odd and hard to say the least.  i willingly had to leave twice.  the third time i did not want to but because i was too outta control because a horrible thing was done to me i was basically kicked out.  i ended up talking to amanda dunwell for a hour or so outside the second time i left and it was good...really good.  she helped me get alot of stuff figured out in my head.  i returned to jacque's later with jon and we hung out for a while.  then everyone left and it was me and jacque alone once again and no one to ruin it this time.  it was quite emotional.

monday i called outta work to go along with fe and becky to drive down to worchester to drop off jacque.  she had alot of shit lets just say that.  we got it all packed in the turck and the car.  she really didnt want me going at first because she had no idea i was going to be there but i had been promising her that i would ever since she decided to go to college.  i was sad when she didnt want me to go.  well more than just sad.  she ended up letting me go and i was sooooo happy.  the ride down was ok.  we got everything moved in and it was ok.  i started to lose it about a half hour before we had to leave her there.  fe and becky left the room because they saw me crying and i cannot thank you two enough for that i really needed those couple minutes with her just to let it out.  from then on i really did not stop crying all day.  she gave everyone their hugs except for me in her room.  we walked her outta her dorm and she started to walk to practice without giving me my hug.  i wanted to die so i asked her what about me.  i could tell that she didnt want to hug me but i knew why but i still needed it.  then i watched as she walked down that road and i don't think iv ever been sadder.  we drove back and it was quite for a while but then things slowly returned to normal.

today i went to work.  then i hung out with rob over at masi's.  jimmy c was there and i didnt kill him so be proud of me.  i dont think i really care anymore.  then we grabbed jon and went on an excursion down a couple dirt roads...we ended up at the zone during one of them.  alot of stuff hit me when i woke up this morning.  i was not sad that she was gone.  im happy for her as long as she stays in touch.  i was sad more that my best friend was leaving than the girl i was with for 3 1/2 years.  i know that right now is not the time for me and her and that we need this time to discover ourselves.  im sure that we will infact stay close.  she is my first love and i will always love her forever.  im going to take this time slow and not rush into anything new.  i know how i fell about certain people and i would like to pursue them as far as they let me.  i got close to people this summer and i would like to stay that way.  my summer was not a total disaster.  i had some amazing moments.  a bunch with jacque and a bunch with other people.

4th of july weekend was great even though something came out.  i needed that weekend in maine with jacque and fe.

mini-golfing and the beach with jodi were amazing and they really made us closer and well kissing her just made it better.

going to the beach with fe and aubrey and meeting up with half of merrimack and diggins hitting the woman in the ass with the frisbee.

working with the town has broadened my scope since the people there are really interesting.

all the nights at the pool hall with davis and rob.

the nights were she layed in my arms.

rescueing jodi from tons of pain with my amazing massage skillz.

the parties!!!

seeing danny j once again even if it was odd.

and more that i cannot even remember right now."

"event","i thought of this while at work around 11 in the afternoon and its now almost 1 at night so this is not as good as i thought at 11.

i have been doing alot of thinking lately about myself and why i do the things that i do.  why do i constantly put myself in similair situations.  why do i keep getting hurt.  one word comes to mind...passion.

i am passionate about making people happy.  seeing them smile and laugh makes me feel great.  the moment of happiness that i am most passionate about is that one that comes at the end of a great night.  where you hug the girl goodbye and then you loosen the grip to where your arms are still around her but still tight enough to feel her and see straight into her eyes.  where you can see deep into their everything, their soul.  it is at that exact moment where i reach total ecstasy.  when you can see that they are feeling the same way about you.  it is the moment that comes right after the hug and right before the kiss that leaves your knees shaking and the butterflies swarming thoughout your stomach.  it is that moment that i am most passionate for.

so i ask you all what are you passionate about?"

But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face

But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending it's as much as i can take

you just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break

the one dimple when she smiles

how when she gets pissed she talks like shes from jersey

that she is a walking talking hockey encyclopedia

how she still sleeps better when she is tucked in

how she seriously thinks her stuffed aniamls have their own litle world

how i can bring her out to a facy restuaraunt and she will order a cheeseburger

how she dances like a fool and doesnt care who is looking

how she will call me just because

how she will talk to me even when i want to be alone

how during out most imtimate an dpassoinate moments she can lick me and just giggle

that she curls up in a ball with snowball and bunny

that she lets me lye my head on her chest to hear her heart beat

that she takes a shower right before a field hockey game

that she has to have perfect hair before oging to bed

that she call her stomach her fat kid and when it grumbles that its speaking to me

that i was her first and she was mine

that no matter what we are doing i can give her a back massage and its like nothing else was happening

her big feet and chipped toe nail polish

that adidas sandals become winter shoes by just adding socks

the way that she makes the butterflies in my stomache flutter

"event","so i couldnt take it anymore and i called her...i know real dumb.  she has treated me like complete shit these past 3 and half years and everyone is right i should try and find someone who is better to me.  but that is not the case that is not what my heart tells me to do.  right now im not concerned about whether or not i will get back together with her or not.  i am not concerned who i should hook up with.  what i am concerned with is whether or not she is still in love with me.  two days ago she didnt think so and today she does...that could change at anytime but i hope and pray that is not the case.  the ball is in her court.  if she drops the ball then i drop with it.  a friendship is just not possible right now and probably for a while.  it would be too hard and i dont want to put my heart through that.  if she is in love with me then it will be all worth it cause honestly for the past 3 1/2 years it all has been.  i wouldnt change it for the worl because im in love with her and i dotn care if people understand it or not.  love is not something that i question.  my heart is broken and so am i and it will mend with or without you...its your choice.

also dont get me wrong i still want to do other things and i plan on it.  if i like a girl then i will pursue because that is what i need.  im not looking for love because i already have it its just the question if im loved back.  if i shal find another love along the way i will not forget the one that i had and i will hold it dear as it was my first.  i follow my heart where ever it shall bring me."

"event","once again i think that it is time to update this thing

friday - party at joe sculls house.  it was a good time.  we basically talked drank and played asshole.  i was constantly the grundle (the personone up from the asshole aka the closest thing to being the asshole on the human body without being it).  raided jen's room and jess and emily tried on jen's bra and her sisters training bra and found some boy shorts that we all agareed were cute (except for joe but who knows what he was thinking in his head).  crashed on the same bed as jodi but we used two different blankets until she used mine as well.  i guess that i cuddled with her in my sleep but o well its all good.  

saturday - not too much that i can really remember except being dumped and going over to jodi's to be sappy.  she is such a great friend because she is there when you need her.

sunday - hmmm i dont remember right now but i might or i just need someone to help fix my memory.

monday -  work and o yea when i got done with that i worked some more.

tuesday - worked.  then i went out with jodi strictly as friends to go putt putt golfing.  well you can only guess how fast that idea went to the shitter.  we end up just having a really fun time flirting and goofing off.  it was the happiest i had been since i got drunk on friday night.  then we went to friendlys to get milkshakes.  then drove back to merrimack and decided to get tacos.  she wouldnt let me pay for anything except the tacos because she ran outta money.  after tacos it was off to her house.  we worked on my myspace account.  she went all OCD on her computer and had to fix all of her songs.  i really didnt mind it was actually fun.  then we ate china man food and watched tv.  she then drove me home where we said goodbye got a hug.  i asked what no goodbye kiss or something like that.  we joking fought over that and i was victorious.  JODI HILL KISSED ME ON THE LIPS.  it was a small one really only a peck.  hahahaha and she thought that i wouldnt have the balls to put that in here but look i did.

weds - work and o yea more work.  went and said goodbye to jodi cause she is leaving for 10 days :( and then off to walmart with davis.

thurs - work and then i called out because i didnt feel like working anymore and i crushed my freakin hand at my other job.  hung out with jacque and i loved it.  i still love her more than anything even though i am off trying to do other things.  i figure if i do this now and get more experiences i wont crave/regret it later.

friday - worked at the turkey hill cemetary all day.  kinda creppy walking on dead people.  visited by my lover.  and poker later tonight hopefully."

memorial day weekend was a good fun weekend minus one slight car accident.  i got to spend two amazing nights with my love.  jacque loves my sisters unborn baby and i will never eat at one mcdicks ever again.  my birthday was great.  i spent time with jacque and then me and phil went drinking with ambria and steve leszinski(sp?).  what else happened that week?  o yea hit up liz's graduationparty and then went to kohls with jaxx, jon, shorty and jaxxs mom.  that was interesting to say the least.  i almost died at the hand sof jacques mom and all she did was look at me.  jon played with some signs...aparently we are buy one get one free he also walked around with a womens sign over his head and the funniest thing was that he stole the cart and shorty folowed him in and around the clothing racks.  after that it was time for some much needed air hockey.  there were some really sketchy dudes there or arab decent that would stop everything they did when jacque came around and they also played a machine gun game and had nearly perfect accuracy...are you scared yet?  iv dont alot of hanging out with jon and rob...been to the pool hall twice.  had an amazing time at jacque's semi.  lexy was wicked funny.  i totally made someone mad at me but i dont like stockers and cindy davis asked me why i dont like her and just for everyone out there i said it...i told her that i dont like sluts. she giggled but i was being totally honest.  i shapperoned and shorty get together with jacque...yes i was trusted by an adult to watch a shorty and they survived.  we went to see some movie that the shorty wanted to see and i threatened to kill her if it was crappy.  she is still alive only because it made fun of the queer eye guy who was in the movie and because it had hilary duff who is like disney channel hot.  then came the big day.  my lovercakes grduates from merrimack high.  yup she did it and im so proud of her.  it mades me so happy to see that she can pull her grades up through ""hard work"" (aka showing off some boobie, and a couple after school specials) to graduate...to bad it didnt work for cindy huh jon? j/k.  she really did put lots of effort into it and i know because i had to calm her during heat of it all.i stayed at her house all day because almost everyone she wanted to see/visit came to her.  left around 1 and met up with lj about 10 minutes later and we drove around and caught up on everything that we missed.  and yesterday i worked and i was dead and i felt sick so it was extremely fun.  but then after that i went to jacques where i find out we are invited to go to lexys to swim.  so we do that and on arrival we see the full scope of it all and i quote from jacque ""lexy did you know that you are rich?""  jacque pointed and said weiner for a couple minutes cause lexy has a weiner dog.  lexy and craig showed up about a half hour after we got to her house because they found some stray horses...boy did we feel like sketchy people.  then she showed us her indoor pool...the room that this thing fits into is the size of my house.  went into the pool and quickly decided that the hottub was the best idea.  went in there and chatted away for a while..it was fun.  we dicided to hit the beach today so now i wait to do so.

if you want to see my pics from graduation and semi go here....

what i dont get is why people try to break us apart.  if they have something to say then come out and say it to me using your real name and with facts..not this happened.  here even better call my cellphone (493-8086) from your house...not some payphone around the corner and tell me what you have to say.  cause honestly if you have to conceil yourself than most likely your bullshit.

ok back to what i was originally saying...i love this girl.  iv taken every picture off my wall because i just want to come home so badly but the one that she gave me of her wearing her cowboy hat.  there is not a day that goes by that i miss her.  im always thinking about her.  hell during my final yesterday i almost started to write about her because i couldnt help myself not think about her.  in less than a week i will be home and in her arms again.  i went to see her yesterday at the lax game and i was the happiest person because i got a hug and a kiss.  god i miss doing that."

<P>iv been pretty depressed lately i think it has to do with the fact that the last time i actually had time to talk to jacque we fought.&nbsp; since she has been in florida iv only talked to her for like 40 minutes and most of that time has been me repeating myself cause she hasnt been able to hear me since when i yell im talking normal and when i talk normal im whispering.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>lets see.....im coming home this thursday...fuck friday classes to take care of jacque and spend some much needed quality time with her.&nbsp; i have 17 days left and then im home for summer vaca and i still need to find a good paying summer job and a new car and i need to sell mine as well.&nbsp; i dont think it will be too hard to sell mine cause its in good condition..there are only minor problems with it.</P>

"event","ok im pretty bullshit about my joke on mtown drama.  it became a drama fest when it was supposed to lighten the mood since i know that some people in the town have had a pretty shitty past week or weeks.  i mean comeon we got Ariane compaling about pregnancy and periods and this other bullshit.  does she have to destroy everything?  i dont care if she is going to one day rule the world, i dont care if she is in NHS or that her GPA is higher than my IQ or that she is on student council.  it was stated that it was a joke post and that means it should not cause drama.  im glad that her post got deleted and that someone beat me to it cause if i didnt have to go to my hockey game then i woulda done it myself.  i cant stand people like her who have to be serious all the time and have to be politically correct and that we have to stand up against everything.  WE ARE FUCKING TEENAGERS LIGHTEN UP A BIT.  i can stand some people saying the stuff about how they dont always happen.  i respect that but she brought it to a level that was beyound the topic.  i know the joke was biased.  that was what made it funny.  honestly do you think that im retarded and that i dont understand pain, just because i dont physically go through it doesnt mean i dont understand.  having to drive home as fast as i can because jacque is crying because she hurts and just sitting with her and holding her and wiping her tears i can understand the pain.  i can see it in her eyes and i can feel it in my heart.  but fuck Ariane.  what is her deal?  honestly its not like i was telling anti-women jokes.  here you go Ariane - why did the women cross the road?  it doesn matter she belongs in the kitchen.  why do women wear watches?  it doesnt matter there is a clock in the kitchen.  i really hope someone shows this to her so that she sees how much of a fool she is being."

"event","so instead of writing my politics paper which is 10 pages long and due thursday i had an ephiphany.  we as men get fucking shafted in sex terms.  we do so much work to get an orgasm that last what? on average 2 seconds.  now while females on the other hand dont have to do shit and their orgasms can last several minutes.  what the fuck is the deal with that.  i want that.  i want mine to last minutes.  ladies are always complaining that guys are too horny.  fine have your orgasm last 2 seconds and see if you still need more.  for a guy to get 1 minute worth of orgasms pleasing himself he has to jerk off 30 times and ill tell you this much that that is physically impossible to do in one day.  a guy would totally bust a nut doing that.  a girl on the other hand 1 time...yup one time and she could have one that last 10 minutes.  a guy having an orgasm everyday for a full year only totals a little over 12 minutes of total orgasm time( 2 sec per day times 365 day divided by 60 second in a minute 2*365=730/60=12.17minutes)  so a girl can have more total orgasm time than the average guy can in one year if she has two orgasms.

i didnt go to finite all week because i didnt feel good.  went to the gym and rowed for 40 minutes straight and then wanted to puke everywhere...i looked at the post set sheet for the team and saw that i beat some of them...hell yea!!  friday night i played some dodgeball and i broke a bone in my foot...how did i do that you ask thinking that im a fool?  i jumped up and caught the ball then when i landed on my foot my weight was not evenly balanced enough so when my foot touched the ground the whole thing compressed and it was a pretty aweful sound and it hurt like a bitch...so what do i do?  i keep playing.  saturday was really fun.  i hung out with michelle and her mom for a bit and then my love came and we watched bill's track meet.  congrats to him on a personal best.  then we headed back to my room for some much needed.....get your mind outta the gutter all we did was talk and i gave her a back and leg massage.  then she had to leave round 7 so instead of walking back from the parking lot to my dorm i hop in the car and make her drive me back.  then i just hung out in my room.  made myself some rice for dinner and watched a movie all by myself cause im cool like that and i dont go out on saturday nights.  sunday grabbed some breakfast then relaxed in the room until i went outside to throw a lil disc with the boys...then dinner and updating and somtime tonight ill prolly work on my paper for my american congress class...o joy."

"event","so as some people know i came home this weekend for easter/b-day celebration at jacque's and to take care of her.  taking care of her has made me think alot.  i know why i like to do it now.  it makes me feel like i can actually help her.  even if its running out to get her more soup.  i can actually see the results of my work.  when she cries what can i do...just be there for her and what results can i see?  her stopping the crying?  you really cant see them because its usually a mental or emotional cry for her cause she is physically tough.  i feel useful when it comes to her needing me cause she is sick or injured.  it really shows her how mucjh i love her and care about her.  id drive home in a heartbeat if she was crying.  id drive as far as i needed swim, run, fly, walk, crawl whatever it takes just to be with her when she needs me.  this right there is an easy way for me to show her what she means to me.  i could buy her flowers but those die...what a great way of showing love, giving her a representation of love and then having it die a week later.  when my aunt was sick before she died i never saw her because i didnt know how i would react and i hate myself for it for not seeing her.  i dont want to make that mistake again.  i know jacque has not reached that extreme but still i want to be there for her i want to do what i should have done a while ago.  when she is in pain i feel it.  i had a hard time looking at her this weekend because of the pain that she was in...you can see it in her eyes and if running to get a movie or laying with her so that she could sleep would help then i was there.  i love her dearly and anything with her is important to me even if its not with other people.  i make jokes about her and about her injury but i still love her with everything that iv got.  i havent been there when she needed me before im not ready to screw up again.


and now onto a different thing.  why is it that some people make a big deal over the dumbest things.  like simple gestures.  just because they are made at a large group of people doesnt mean that they dont apply to one person.  and the fact that people are posting things about others personal lives that they do not want to discose to the world.  yes in time it will be found out about, but maybe some people should let the people directly involved handle it by telling people.  o yea there is that other thing that some people just dont get the hint but that is another story for another time.

so this weekend was fun.  did my best to take care of jacque.  talked to a drunk guy at bk.  got some amazing avaitars.  got my penis made fun of by fe.  had to pick up the shorty and got a major headache by hearing a bunch of prepubesent boys and girls screaming at the top of their lungs for like 10 minutes....dont know which ones were the boys and which ones were the girls but some people need their balls to drop and soon.  met craig officailly...he seems like a really cool kid.  made fun of people per usual.  made someone mad/jealious and it wasnt over a girl instead it was over food.  watch the crew races.  made a puppy very happy.  put a smile on someone's face.  nicknamed jacque's wires her bling bling.  got king kone.  bought a ridiciously large fake flower.  watched a middle school play that was actually good.  made a 7th grader a really cool kid in front of her friends.  and the best thing just relaxed with my lover pants.

o yea its been decided as of last week that as well as a kisser fish i am also a cat fish cause of my beard...so not only do i say ""kiss the fishy"" and ""kiss the fucking fishy""...i also go ""meow swim swim swim""

o yea fe stop drawing a penis i mean cowboy hat on the windows of the vehicles that i drive."

"event","you ever feel like no matter what you do its the wrong thing...no matter how hard you try you are pleasing the wrong person.  i cant seem to make everyone happy.  and i make the one person who matters sad.  its been a rough week on her and its been the same on me.  iv been trying to balance who iv become and who people expect me to be.  it makes me wonder who i am.  i dont know that for sure anymore and i havent for a while.  alot of stuff has happened in my life in the past year to make me rethink that.  i know who i want to be.  i want to be the person who makes her happy.  i have goals in life but i dont know how to achieve them.  i want to help people and i want to grow old with her.  iv been without her and sometimes i feel like i still am and that is why i get jealious.  i feel like there is something that was there but is not there at this moment.  i feel like one day something was lost and it has yet to be fully found.  there is a spark missing.  a certain spark that kept us inseparable.  a spark that was there even after i broke up with her.  the spark has faded and has yet to be brought back to its fullest.  it seems like now there is always a problem with something and it seems to be with me.  i dont know how to do this anymore.  how does she put up with me.  iv treated her like crap ever since the dan thing...i dunno if its my way of punishing her or im just not as over it as i thought.  im a terrible boyfriend and im trying i am but its not working out as planned.  the more i try the worse it gets...the less i try the worse i think that i havent done everything that i should do.  she cries and all i can do is hold her, but i want to cry aswell.  im not as strong as i used to be.  i am weaker.  yea i just admitted it.  im not as strong as i used to be.  alot of shit has gone down to weaken me.  i need someone to guide me.  i cant always be the person to guide everyone else.  nope not this time not no how not no way.  im the one who needs the guidance this time.  i need someone to take me by the hand and help me out before i make this any worse.  if i keep this up i feel as if she will either break up with me or cheat on me again.  i am afraid.  I AM AFRAID.  I AM WEAK.  I AM NOT STRONG.  I NEED HELP.  I AM LOST.  I AM SCARED.  I AM JEALIOUS.  I WANT TO CRY.  I AM IN LOVE.  I FEEL LIKE IM MESSING EVERYTHING UP.  is there anything else that i need to admit while im breaking down and telling everyone this?  am i missing anything?

i just want to be happy and i wane her to be happy and sometimes i wonder if that means that she needs to be alone and away from me."

"event","so we just had the most disturbing floor meeting ever.  my RA brought us downstairs into the rec lounge and we had to go into a room and just look around, but the catch was we had to be completely silent while inside the room.  we had no idea what to expect.  

so what was inside the room you ask.  ill tell you.

inside the room was a collection of posters that had been put up around the building that had been defiled...also there were posters on the walls that were full of things that had been written on the walls, message boards, and just about anywhere you could write someting and also some things that had been said.  everything in the room had shit written about being gay, being of a different race and/or sex.  

what the fuck people why cant we all grow up.  it just makes me sick having to read what was written down on these posters.  i wont even give an example about the shit that was written because it was just that bad.

i think the best thing was that in the center of the room there was a large piece of paper where you could write a reflection about what you saw.  at least there are some good people still left because what was written down there sure did stop me from vomiting."

She's got a way of pleasin'
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason
Anyway

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But i have to laugh when she reveals me

She's got a way of talkin'
I don't know what it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'
Anywhere

She comes to me when i'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and i get turned around

She's got a way of showin'
How i make her feel
And i find the strength to keep on goin'

She's got a light around her
And everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
Everywhere

She comes to me when i'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound

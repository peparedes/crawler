"event","Today I shall finally tell all how I am really doing right now.  For the past few days I have been feeling like utter crap.  Mostly I have been feeling extremly alone and cut off from people around me.  One reason I feel really cut off is that when me and a few friends wanted to start playing D&D again and try playing it once a week it fell apart faster then anything.  It wasn't just the chance to roleplay around with a character it was the chance to actually hang out with friends at least once a week not spend time alone thinking about how alone I am in this world right now. Mostly the reason it seems we can't play or hang out is the fact that we all work a lot. The other reason it seems is that they are addicted to <a href=""http://www.worldofwarcarft.com"">World of Warcraft</a> to the point they can be sucked away for hours on end.<br>
Secondly I also feel really blah is because I feel alone at heart.  For the last few years I have gotten the friends speech from most women I  asked to go out with, usally within the first week of asking them out =/.  I am hoping I will meet someone when I start going to classes at <a href=""http://www.PCC.edu"">PCC</a> but that might be a far cry from what will happen *sigh* I just don't want to be so alone anymore is that too much to ask for?"

"event","Well for those that have been wonding what I have been up to since I made my last post.  I have been working on a site design for a comic site me and my friend are going to be doing soon.  Already have the hosting plan setup at <a href=""http://dreamhost.com"">Dream Host</a>  Got in 3 days before they stopped there sale on space since right now all disk space and bandwidth has been trippled for your plan as long as you stay with them and pay for your account on time. :)  Prices stay the same on most of them some went down but all types of accounts get the tripple loving.  Also ontop of that getting one free domain with it.  For those wanting to see the site it will be put up at http://www.strange-omens.com  right now the site isn't fully setup on there.

"event","Well its been a while since I actually updated my LiveJournal. ^^;<br>
Well since I last updated I found a new Job at Fred Meyer.  It has only been a week since I got this job and already I love it.  Most of the people that I work with are really nice and aren't always in a bad mood 24/7 from crappy pay and lack of breaks.  I quit the other Job I worked at, Coast to Coast Event Security.  Since they are a complete waste of a company entirely.  They treat most of their employees like crap.  Most of the events people work the employee gets no breaks.  I won't even get started on how bad the conditions can get at some events.  Also they pay people the absolute min wage they can.  Well enough bitching about them.<br>
<br>
Well its fast approaching time for http://www.sakuracon.org and I am all ready to go there for that fun filled weekend. ^_^  I shall bring a camera and post pictures of the good, the bad, and the funny cosplays that I see at the con. ^^  I hope to see a lot of funny ones. ^^;  Such as this one. <img src=""http://www.hongfire.com/gallery/data/507/43085Cosplay39.jpg""/>  Also I can't wait to meet the people from http://otakusingles.com/forums/ that are coming. :D  Especially Aislinn. ^^;'"

"event","Well the weekend from hell is over.  I am glad it is too.  It started off really bad by on Friday morning learning that my parents might be leaving each other.  Also I was sick with the Flu that day.  Talk about bad timeing on getting bad news.  Also Not having work that day made it even worse.  As the weekend progressed it seemed that it would happen that my mom would be leaving by the end of the week.  But today I got news (from the whiteboard) that mom would be staying here. ^_^ All was worked out and I am feeling better again too. :) I also would like to thank Lizzy(My Girl ^_^) and Aislinn(A great friend) for helping me out through this. :) You two rock out loud. :)"

"event","Not doing so good now.  Just got a call from work saying ""We don't need you at all this week actually""  So now I have nothing to do this week execpt look for a better job with more hours.  This really means its going to be even harder to get out to see Lizzy. :(  I really want to get out there and see her.  She needs someone there to snuggle and I need someone to snuggle.  I really love her and I want to be there for her right now. :(  Stupid work and there not needing me at all *sighs*
Also in this update I may or may not be taking time off from being online for a while to get somethings done.  Such as Job hunting and teaching myself how to do PHP/MySQL work.  *sighs* maybe its almost time to turn my server into a Pay to use one.  It would help bring in some money for getting to see Liz.  Who here would actually want to use it if it was setup to be pay to use?
Well thats all I have to say for now."

"event","In my first rant of the new year I will start by saying.. People are getting stupider and stupider it seems.  People are still buying into the shit that a pill will do just about anything for you.  I'm just shocked that there isn't a pill that comes out on TV that say ""It will do whatever you want it to do its just magical like that and shit."" *shakes head*
Also in my next setup on my rant.  People need to shut up about being angry at a certain set of people because they have a life thats not what they want to see.  Such as people against Gay marriage... Whats wrong with people of the same gender getting married and getting all the benifits of being married? Does it hurt anyone to see others happy?  In my opinion people should stop bitching about things like this and pretend to not care at all.  Complaining about how your neighbor is having sex with someone of the same gender.
Now in non-rant news.  I'm in love. ^_^ With my lovely Lizzy-chan :D
*dances*
I hope I can get to see her on Feb. 14th. ^^"

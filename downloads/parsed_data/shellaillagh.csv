I went to Cedar Point a week or so ago.  It was so much fun!  I thought I was going to die a couple on times, on some coasters.  Most notably, Millennium Force and Top Thrill Dragster.  On Millennium, I got so scared while going up the hill.  I was riding with Brittany, and I kept grabbing her hand and trying not to freak out.  Haha, I survived, though!  Top Thrill Dragster was even worse, however.  You're sitting in this little car, waiting for a light to turn green.  You know that when the light turns green, you're going to be shot off at 140 miles an hour, eventually turning straight up, and turning straight back down on the other side of the ride.  I guess I must have closed my eyes somewhere going up, because I opened them coming back down...  Big mistake.  Haha, but, again, I lived.

We tried to go to Put-In Bay on our last day, but the ferry wasn't running.  Boo!

What have I been up to recently?  I've been going to lots of people's graduation parties.  Those are always fun.  But what stinks is that I usually don't get there until the tail end of the party.  You know why?  Because I've got to work (what seems like) all the time for BB!  It's really not that big of a deal, though.  I like my job.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  And I just got a raise from 7/hr to 7.5/hr!  Yea, 50 cents!

Yesterday, I finally found out my rooming assignment for Eastern.  I'm in Case.  While it's not my top choice (that would be Sullivan), it is a freshman connections dorm.  I really don't know what that means.  I guess it'll be fun to live with all freshmen, and knowing that we're all experiencing the same freshman things.... but I really wanted Sullivan!  I also found out my roommate.  I found her on Facebook.  She seems nice enough, but you can't really tell until meeting her.

That seems to be everything that was on my mind recently.  Hopefully, it won't be a month until my next update.  Haha!"

"event","This journal has kind of fallen to crap.  That's sad, because it's been going for so long.  Oh well, hopefully, I'll find the motivation to maintain it over the summer and into college.  I kind of can't believe it.  I started this journal during my freshman year.  And now, here I am, on my last day of my senior year.  Haha, almost a freshman again!  That's so scary!

Today, I am going to King's Island with Ford's testing group.  Too bad Ford himself is going with us!  Apparently, counseling is more important than going with us.  Boo, Ford!  What would AUH20 think?  The only downer is that I'm going to miss almost all of my last day of high school.  We're leaving at nine, and getting back to the high school around eight.  But, oh well, we've got graduation practice and whatnot.

Oh my God!  I'm going to graduate this Saturday?  Me!  I still remember wondering into the school as a wee little freshman, and looking for math class and getting lost.  I somehow wound up in the art hallway during my search.  Haha, I was dumb as a freshman.  It's hard to believe how much I, and everyone else, has changed in just four years.  We've all become much more mature, and bustier...  Haha, maybe just me, than.

To all of my friends in the class of '07:  I'm going to miss you, guys!  We've had some awesome times together, and some really bad times together.  But the important bit is that we made it!  We're going to graduate this Saturday!  You know what that means?  No more CATS testing!  No more portfolios!  No more asking permission to breath!  I'm so proud of all of you, and I love you all dearly."

"event","Oh man, its that time of year again: AP exams.  Today, I took the English IV exam.  Surprisingly, I thought the multiple choice section was much easier than those we have done in class in the past.  Maybe that was because no one was talking and we were all concentrated.  But those essays, those killed me.  It wasn't that they were hard, just that I hate writing essays.

The first one was a comparison between two poems.  However much I hate writing essays, I hate writing comparative essays the most.  I never think that I include enough information in the essay.  It makes me feel all concerned and such.  The other two were easier.  The second essay was a passage from <u>Johnny Got His Gun</u>, which made me think of APUSH last year and that creepy 'One' video.  Damn you, Metallica!  It also makes me think of visiting my brother in CA last year, because we talked about that book.

The last essay was by far, my best one.  We had to chose a book on our own to write about.  I used <u>The Picture of Dorian Gray</u>.  Thanks, Oscar Wilde!  I really loved that book, and it worked perfectly with the prompt.

Tomorrow is the European History exam.  I may be able to pass it with some divine intervention.  And probably not even with that help.  It's just like throwing away 83 dollars.  I am looking forward to never having to do another DBQ again after tomorrow.  Ah, the joys of those Death Bringing Questions.  I that is where I'm going to fall apart, on the writing.  I guess I'll see tomorrow.

Wish me luck!

Monday is the Biology exam, and then I'll be finished with AP tests.... FOREVER!  Oh man, it's going to be wonderful.  The only exam that I have any hope of passing is the English exam, and that is perfectly fine with me.  See, I've already got a history credit from APUSH last year, and I have to take Biology in college, regardless of if I pass the exam or not.

Woohoo, graduation in 16 days!"

Hopefully those people making reservations will buy lots of packages and I'll get the commission from it!  One can only hope...  I figure it won't be too bad.  Chanel is there from 9-2, and then T from 2-5.  Those are both trainees with me.  

Yesterday, I got stuck handing out tickets (250 of them....) to a group from Xavier University.  It's like all 250 of them came at once!  It was crazy!  It must have been for some dance, or something, because all of them had white one.  Snazzy!

I almost called into work today.  I woke up around five this morning, feeling like shit.  My stomach ached, and I had a killer headache.  I'll spare you the details because they weren't pretty....  I finally did fall back asleep soon after that and woke up feeling slightly better.  The stomachache was gone, but it still felt like someone had driven a spike into my temple.  But that's slowly going away at the moment.  Lol, it's regressed to a dull throb in the back of my skull.  ^_^!

Throughout the whole time I was sick, I was having this horrible dream.  I dreamt that my Grandma Hazel had died.  I was stuck in some city with this family.  We were watching some sort of play.  But it was in a dark basement or alley, or something dark and creepy.  At the very end of the play, there was a guy dressed as a girl.  I guess in the play he had come to exact revenge.  He lit another actor on fire using his mind...  Then the family and I tried to get a taxi.  At this point, I'm desperate to go to my Grandma's funeral, but they won't take the taxi's that try to pick us up.

It was... an odd dream.

Maybe it has something to do with our principal, Mrs. Webb, having her contract not renewed for next year.  You what the worst part about the whole thing is?  This is only happening to her because the superintendent, Anthony Strong, has only personal and/or political reasons to let her go.  He must be fucking blind to not see how great of an influence she has been on our school.  No one knew who he was when he was our principal!  He came out of his office, what... twice?  The school sees Mrs. Webb almost every day.  Both good and bad kids!  

There is going to be a school board meeting Monday night at seven at Central Office.  It's right behind what used to be Alexandria Elementary.  If you support Mrs. Webb, or even if you want to stand up to corrupt authority figures, then come to the meeting!  

After all, a spider is nothing without its <b>Webb</b>, and neither are we."

XD, and at the same, such a little kid.  You guys remember being little and getting so excited about drawing on the driveway or sidewalk with chalk?  Haha, it was always a highlight of my summer days.

We used my car as a rolling boombox.  ...Maybe that could explain why I had to jump it in the afternoon.  XD, thanks, guys!  But it was very worth it.

I'm ashamed of myself, however.  I ended up sleeping in my car from about two AM on.  Oh, and by the way, four hours of sleep is not a good idea to go to school with.  But, again, so worth it!  

All of these redneck hicks kept making runs through the parking lot.  I guess they were waiting for us to leave, so they could slaughter a deer.  Bastard rednecks.  Haha, that reminds me:  Sabrina almost got us raped!  A truck drove through around two, and Sabrina waves to the guy.  XD, he stops and has a nice little conversation with them.  They ended up just blaring their rap and speeding off.  Geez, Mase!

Friday was the Beta Easter Egg Hunt.  I love little kids!  Matt, don't worry, I didn't take any.  I went to Grant's Lick and Reiley.  Laura and I looked for our little kid we had last year, Danny, but he must have moved on to the coveted second grade.  It was a good time, nontheless.  I got little kids that ran all the time.  I got some good exercise!

We went to the Village Green to eat, and ended up spending about two hours there.  We had to wait for the other bus, that went to Cline and Campbell Ridge, to meet up with us.  I <3 LJS!  Haha.  It's like heaven dipped in grease.  After we ate, we had so much time left over.  Molly, Rachel, Mase, Mash, Amberlie, and I got a bit of shopping done.  We went to Movie Gallery, and rented <u>The Descent</u> to watch later that night.  I'm now a card-carrying member!

We then moved on to Bath and Body Works, where I spent 13 dollars on a lip product.  Yes, I know, I know.  I've got a problem.  But it's a plumper!  Then on to PayLess for Mase.  From there, we went to WalMart, 'cause that's the cool place to be.  I got my picture taken with the Easter Bunny!  Yay!

It felt so wonderful doing all of this stuff during school.

We got back, and we (Amberlie, Lauren, and I) didn't go back to band.  Around 2:15, we go back to the band room, where we are told that Wesche is writing up anyone that wasn't in band from Beta.  Such a jackass.  Haddix saved our lives, though.  Lol, we're such nerds, worried about a write-up.  Oh well, it all worked out.

We had a movie night at Amberlie's with <u>The Descent</u>.  I had seen it before, so I told everyone when the scary parts were coming... but still jumped myself.  I'm so proud of Lauren, she actually (sort of) watched a horror film!  Bravo!  God, that is a creepy movie.  Those creatures...  They're like Gollums gone bad.

It's funny, it was Matt's and I's last prom, and he's not even in high school anymore.  That probably doesn't make any sense, but it did in my head.

Before, Matt and I went to this wonderful restaurant called Jag's.  Oh man, so good!  I don't know if it beats McCormicks and Schmicks, though.  They have this chocolate cake, and it is the best thing I've ever tasted.  Seriously, if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it'd be this cake.  It's heavenly.

The actual dance was amazing, too.  It was great seeing pictures of me and all my friends on all the TVs in the place.  Lol, made me feel famous.  It seemed to go by so quickly.  At the very end, there was a giant senior circle dance.  Too bad it was to Garth Brook's ""Friends in Low Places.""  Haha, lol.  It was nice, though, to have everyone take off their label and forget who they hate, and just dance.  That's what I love about prom, it brings everyone together.

Wow, I just realized that this entry is a week late...  Oh well, time flies.

Our little group ended up doing our own little senior circle dance to the last song.  It was Vitamin C's ""Graduation.""  Fitting.  I almost cried, but I didn't!  I can only imagine how much I'm going to cry at graduation.  Just thinking about it makes me a little sad. ;_;

We went to Molly's afterwards, which was fun, but also very loud.  Haha.  We ended up shoving 15 or so people into her basement.  It was the first time Matt and I spent the night together.  Well, sort of.  I got cranky because it was five A.M. and I wanted to sleep, but no one would shut up, so I took my pillow and blanket and moved to the guest bedroom.  Sorry, guys.  Haha, her dad came in and was all confused about why I was in there.

One month until we're done with high school.  It's an odd feeling, it makes me sad and relieved.  Sad, obviously because there are going to be some people that I'm close to that I might not see again.  

Laura, even though you're going to The Cumberlands, we're still going to chillax together.  Haha, as long as you don't do that crazy pinky-lock-popping action.  That's not cool.

It's also relieving because... I'm done with high school!  I'll never <i>have</i> to go back to Campbell County High School.  Sure, I'll be back to visit friends and such, but no one is going to make me stay there!  It's a wonderful feeling.

Also, it terrifies me.  I, Courtney Lynn Jackson, am going to college.  Me, the girl who used to get so home sick and cry.  But, to be fair to me, I haven't done that since... seventh grade, at least.  Haha, I'm such a wuss.  But college...  It's going to be so radically different from here.  I'm the girl that has never done her own laundry.  And money, ha, that's going to be fun.

Prom is tomorrow.  My last prom is tomorrow!  Ah!  Haha, but its also Matt's last prom, and he seems to be taking it pretty well.  <3  It's so surreal.  If I'm like this now, in March, can you imagine how I'm going to be in May, when we actually graduate.  

I was thinking about this the other day.  Every year that I've been at graduation, it's always been to play in the band.  Well, not counting my sophomore year when I went to see my beau walk across the stage.  But this year, I'm going to be the one walking across the stage!

After Somerset; Chelsey, Taylor, and I went to Bowling Green for KHSSL.  I tripled at state my senior year!  KHSSL is held at WKU's campus (BOO!), so we had to tramp all around campus to get to our rooms.

More to come later!  Matt's here!

---------------

Well, I got around to finishing this only a few days later than when I started.  So where was I?  KHSSL, sounds good.

I took so many funny pictures while there.  It was so much fun!  I'm glad it wasn't as cold as it was last year.  On Saturday, semis were flighted, so we were free the later part of the afternoon.  Tyler, Catherine, Ashley, Megan, and I hung out in this little concrete park being ourselves.  It must have looked odd to strangers.  Haha.  

From Bowling Green, Taylor and I went to Louisville for Governor's Cup.  We stayed in Suites at the Galt House!  Woohoo, I love suites at the Galt House!  The first night, I roomed with Taylor and her mom... right next to the guys.  Who played Risk... at all hours of the night.  Geez.  And they're weren't quiet Risk players, either.  Someone in their room laughs like a girl...  I'm thinking Dean.  Haha.

The second night, I roomed with the FPS girls.  Lots of fun.  I feel like Mash and I got a lot... closer as friends.  XD.  At one point in the night, we pulled a ""Lauren-and-Courtney"" and invaded their bed.  They din't enjoy it, but we did!  Nicole seemed to especially enjoy it.  Teehee.

As usual, we spent a lot of time walking around Louisville.  I love Borders!  I found <u>Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72</u> about the 1972 Presidential election.  Only 15 dollars!  Oh man, I love Hunter S. Thompson.  At one point, we decided to play piggy back races in the pedway.  Yea, that didn't work out...  Here's the story:

It was Mase and I against Mash and Nicole.  Sidenote, the surprise of the trip was Mash could carry Nicole.  Bravo, Mash!  Anyway, our strategy was to heckle them.  Instead of heckling them, Mase decides it would be best to take off running and fall down.  XD, nice move.  I landed sort of on my knee.  It's all bruised and gross looking.  

Oh yeah, that's a good story."

We left from school Thursday afternoon, missed all of Friday, and got back Sunday.  Seriously, I haven't had that much fun in such a long time.  I met lots of new and interesting people.  I love speech team people.  They're so polite, friendly, and usually funny.  I'm so proud of my sophomore, Ashley!  She made it to semi's in both prose and poetry.

Ashley, you should have made it to finals in Prose over that brains kid!

The hotel was a Holidome, so I went swimming!  I also went hot-tubbing, which is always a fun time.  There was also a sweet arcade.  Megan, Ashley, and I played a fun game where we used the toy guns attached to the game machine to have gun battles.  They were epic.  We also played around in the exercise run.  We tried to imitate the OK Go's video on the treadmills, which didn't work out.

Boyfriend Matt and I went to a Dropkick Murphys concert that Sunday I got home.  Oh man, it was intense.  We stood closer to the front than last time, and we got shoved around so much when they came on.  I really liked two of the opening acts: The Aggrolites and The Briggs.  During the Briggs' set, I watched Jenny dance around in the moshpit.  She's crazy, that girl.  Matt saved my life when everyone started shoving.  Thank you, Matt!  I owe my life to you!

Brother Matt and I went out tonight to a Thai restaurant and to the Cincinnati Public Library.  Good times.  I tried Red Curry for the first time.  It was sweet and spicy at the same time.  Wonderful!  I got lots of CDs at the library.  I love checking them out and burning them to my iPod.  It makes me feel like I'm cheating the system.  Haha!

So, tomorrow kicks off all of my states.  I have to be at the high school at 8:15 for Concert Festival.  From there, I'm going to Taylor, her mom, and Chelsey to Bowling Green for KHSSL.  From there, Taylor, her mom, and I are going to Louisville for Governor's Cup.  I'm most excited for Governor's Cup.  I think it's going to be the most laid back of the three.

I just worked so hard on it last year, and I really, really want to use it in my portfolio this year.  I thought it was lost and gone forever, but tonight I found it!

"event","Lauren, Laura, Ashely, and I went to the Levee last night.  It was a fun time.  We tried on dresses- well, really it only I that tried on a dress- and I found one that I absolutely loved!  It's red and has a Greek pleat on the skirt and a really high waist.  The best part about it?  It was only 89 dollars.  There were only two of them in the store, so hopefully I can get one.

We went to Claries, and I got a key chain like yours, Kara and Molly.  Only mine is a little frog!  How cute!  I went shopping with my birthday money, which was only 30 dollars.  But to a girl who never has money, it was exciting.  XD  We spent an hour and a half in Barnes and Noble's.  I saw Beth and Vanessa there, and we had a nice chat.  We talked about getting tattoos and concerts.  It was a fun time.

We left around 10.... And promptly got lost.  XD, we came out of the backway of the garage.  I thought I knew how to get to 471 from there, but I didn't.  Oops!  We ended up on 8th St. somehow.  While exploring Newport, we came upon these hooded guys circling a double-parked car.  That was... interesting.  But, never fear, we eventually found our way back home.  Haha, Laura kept saying she knew where we were, and then that she didn't.

Tonight is the Flogging Molly concert, and I can't wait.  I've seen them once before with my sister.  This time I'm going to see them with friends and Matt.  Lol, my sister is going to the concert as well, but not with us.  Flogging Molly is such an awesome live band.  Dave King, the lead singer, is absolutely hilarious.
Ah!  I'm so excited!"

"event","Yesterday was the Regional Governor's Cup competition.  Unfortunately, the quick recall team isn't going to state.  Highlands and SK made it.  I'm happy for SK.  And... I'm.. not unhappy that Highlands is going, but I'm also not happy about it.  I'm bitter.  And still pissed off a little bit about it.  We ended the match with us winning by one.  Highlands sends two inquiries down.  One about the Battle of Bull Run and if you have to say First Battle of Bull Run v. Second Battle of Bull Run.  That one was thrown out, so it didn't affect the score.  Their second one was about Gustavus Adolphus.  They got it, tying us up, and sending us into overtime.

Long story sort of short, they got to five points first, and won.  Manker later found out that the inquiry awarded to them was wrong.  Thus technically, we won the match.  But, it's over and done with, so there's nothing I can say or do about it now.  I'm still upset, can you tell?  

But, I just want the whole team to know that even though we didn't make it to State as a team, this year was still amazing to me.  Lol, this is the senior girl coming out in me.  Haha, the same one that cried when we lost.  But anyway, we had a wonderful time together!  I'm glad I got to spend my senior year with a group like you guys.  And you guys have to make it to State next year, so I can come back and watch you guys win!

But, on the bright side!  I'm going to state in Language Arts!  I got second at Regionals, and I was one point behind Katie, who took first!  Ah!  That kills me!  

My day only got better from there.  Much, much better!  Matt picked me up from the high school once we got back.  XD, this whole time, I was under the impression that we were going someplace nice for dinner.  Haha, he blindfolded me the whole way!  XD, I thought we ended up somewhere in Cincinnati.  He kept asking me if I was confused.  Lmao.  So we get to where we're going, and he carries me to the door, you know, because it's hard to walk blindfolded.

He opens up the door for me, takes off my blindfold, and guess what I see.  Not only are we not in Cincinnati, (we weren't even in Ohio), but we were at the front door to my house.  And inside my house were all my friends.  Oh my gosh, you could have knocked me over with a straw when I first saw it all.  Haha, it was the best feeling.  Everyone yelled surprise, and I almost cried from being too happy.  

See, Matt had told me that he was planning something for my birthday, and that he couldn't make it happen until next weekend.  God!  He knew the whole time while saying that to me, that he was going to have it last night.  Lol, I had <i>no</i> idea.  At all!  All my friends knew, and no one said anything to me!  I'm proud of you guys!  You all have HUGE mouths, and you didn't say anything!  

Thank you so much, everyone!  You made my day perfect, even after getting screwed by the Governor's Cup judges!  Especially you, Matt.  I love you so much, and you putting all this together means the world to me.  I can't wait to spend so many more birthdays with you, too!

I love all of you guys so much!"

I've figured out what I wanted: 
1. the soundtrack to <u>Music and Lyrics</u>
2. new headphones for my iPod
3. some sweet Motion City Soundtrack jams

If you still don't know what to get me, look into your soul...  XD  You guys know me, you know what I like and what I don't.  You pretty much can't go wrong with chapstick.  Haha, but I've got enough Burt's Bees to last three lifetimes.  Thanks, Matt!  If one of you can deliver Hugh Grant to my house, that'd be fabulous, too.

Just kidding, Matt!

Speaking of Hugh, Matt and I saw a wonderful movie called <u>Music and Lyrics</u> a few days ago.  It's wonderful!  I had low expectations, only because it's a romantic comedy, and those try to hard.  But I loved this one!  Hugh Grant has all these funny one-liners and witty lines.  Drew Barrymore played a really... odd character.  And who knew Hugh could sing?  

He plays an 80's pop star trying to get back in the game.  A pop star (Cora Corman) asks him to write her a song in a few days.  Grant and Barrymore end up writing the song together, and getting to know (and falling in love) together.  The ending was really sweet, too.

Everyone should see it!"

Nice job, Kara and Rachel!  I miss you guys!  The one day of pre-cal just wasn't the same.  You've got to tell me all about it when you get back.  And be sure to tell me of you guys picked up awesome new slang.  ...And any boys!

How was everyone else's Valentine's Day?  I'm beginning to see why everyone hates it so much.  Matt had to work and go to class today, so I spent most of it alone.  Although he did come over around nine tonight, so we could exchange gifts.  He sent me two dozen roses, and brought me a cute little teddy bear.  So sweet!  Thank you, Matt!  I got lots o' chocolates and candy, and I got him one of those singing cards.  Heehee, it played Wild Thing!

I don't know what to do with myself on all of these snowdays.  I guess I could study for EHAP and Criminal Justice, but that's just no fun.  Maybe I could make a snowman!  But everyone keeps telling me that this snow isn't the snowman building type.  Oh well.  So... any suggestions?"

There is supposed to be another White Death coming Monday afternoon, around four.  It's supposed to be worse than the one we had before.  It's funny when you think about it:  up until January, it almost felt like Spring.  And then the weather took a turn for the worse, and things got all cold and snowy.  Oh well, at least I'll have some snowdays my senior year.

Tonight, Matt and I made truffles.  I love truffles!  They turned out to be really easy to make, after some initial setbacks with our mixer.  Haha, it started to smoke when we tried to blend the three cups of melted chocolate chips and three pounds of sugar.  Matt left me all alone to roll the mixture into balls and roll them in cocoa.  Haha, it was the best part!

Truffles for everyone at school tomorrow!

That was a good time.  Everyone on the team is going to state, but for one freshman.  After regionals, I went to Brittany's for her party.  It turned out to be a smaller gathering than I expected it to be, but still lots of fun!  I saw <u>Cruel Intentions</u> for the first time there.  That's an... odd movie.  Odd and sexual.  What kind of family do you have to belong to in order to want to bone your step-sibling?  We also watched Saw III, which is always a lovely movie to watch before falling asleep."

A few practices ago, Manker broke it down with what places we would have to get to take first overall, even if we got second in QR.  I'm a bit nervous.  Probably because this is my last district ever.

I'm pretty sure we are going to do well.  I suppose I'll know for sure by the end of the day.  After Districts, mom, dad, and I are going ""experience"" Pink Floyd at the Aronoff.  Dad thinks he bought first row tickets.  Of all the shows we've been to see, he gets first rows for this one?  Oh well, it'll still be nice.  Oh!

Last year, as one of the juniors in the Dual-Credit program, I would sit in study hall and listen to the seniors talk about college, scholarships, graduation.  And now, it's me doing that same stuff.

Come this August, I'm not going to be a student of Campbell County High School anymore.  I'm going to be a Freshman at Eastern Kentucky University.  I'm going to be going to school, and living in Richmond.  It's going to be the first time I've spent any prolonged periods of time away from my home, family, and friends.  It's surreal.

Oh, by the way, I'm going to be a cliche senior here.  But you know what?  I deserve to be, after spending the last four years of my life at the same place, with the same people.

I can't believe that all friends and I aren't going to see each other on a daily basis.  Sure, most of my friends are going to UK, and one is actually going to EKU with me, but it's going to be so different.  I can't believe that I'm going to live on my own.  Sure, you can say that living in a dorm isn't <i>really</i> living on your own, but to me, it seems like it is.  It'll be so radically different.  This is sort of what I wrote my essay about, having to learn ""life lessons.""  I'll finally have to do my own laundry.  That's... terrifying to me!"

"event","The whole three states at once situation has cleared up.  Finally.  See, we're going to Louisville on Thursday with the band to do that whole playing thing, and then one of Taylor's parents are going to pick us up and take us to WKU for speech, and then back to Louisville for academic team.  Now all I have to do is make it to state for speech and academic team.

I'm so, so nervous that I won't.  I know that sounds dumb, but I am.  I'm more concerned about speech team than I am academic team.  As far as Academic is concerned, all that stands in our way is Highlands, and we've beat them every time we've played them this year.  We have our final 'practice' match with them Tuesday.  Our next one against them is at Regionals.  And even if we get beat by them, I'll probably still go to state with written assessments.  

But Speech, that makes me nervous.  At regionals, you have to get a composite of six or less to qualify.  You have two rounds to compete in.  So you have to average three or better in those two rounds.  I didn't do so well at the last tournament we went to, so I don't know how well I'm going to do at Regionals.  Last year, I made it for Duo Improv.  This year, I hope to make it for Duo Improv and Prose.  Solo would be nice too, but I doubt it'll happen.  

So... I don't know what'll happen.  I'm just a worry-er.  

Other than that little situation, things have been going well for me.  I finished the Elks scholarship and got it turned in.  If I don't get anything out of all that damn work I put in... I don't think I'll go to college.  Right now, I'm working on some scholarships to EKU.  Scholarships make me so nervous!  Why can't I be a high school senior forever?

<center><u><b>SPOILER AHEAD</u></b></center>

Tonight, Matt and I went to go to <u>The Curse of the Golden Flower</u>.  It's a Chinese film, all in Chinese with English subtitles.  Very good, but very long.  It was so sad, though.  Everyone starts dying towards the end.  There's the Emperor and the Empress, and they have three kids: Yu, Wan, and Jai.  The Empress has some sort of disease, anemia, I think, and so she is taking medicine hourly.  She finds out about halfway into the film, that her husband the Emperor, is poisoning her so that she will eventually go insane.  She, in turn, plots with Jai son to overthrow the Emperor.  

Little side note: she's sleeping with Wan, who also happens to be the Crown Prince.  Emperor has been married before, and Wan is not <i>really</i> her son, but still creepy.  Emperor told Wan that he real mother was dead (not really), and she shows up and bad things happen.

Anyway, Empress tells Wan about her plan, and he tells Emperor.  When the big attack happens, it's stopped by the Emperor's forces, and there is a lot of death going on.

"event","This is crazy.  This Spring break, is all the state competitions (or the equivalent) for band, speech team, and academic team.  And you what is so awesome about that?  Absolutely nothing!  Wesche told us today that our concert festival is either going to be the 15th, 16th, or the 17th.  Do you know when speech for state is?  The 15th through the 17th!  But wait!  There's more!  Academic team state is the 17th through the 19th.

How much does all of that suck?  Taylor and I told Wesche about it during band, and he acted like we wanted to skip the contest because we just wanted to sleep.  Does he seriously think that we know it's important?  Does he seriously think that we don't care?  Or maybe he just doesn't understand that band students are not just <i>band</i> students, but they also do other activities.

So now what are we supposed to do?  We told Page about it, and she said she'd e-mail him.  What I would give to see that e-mail.  The only option we came up with was maaybe if he decided to go to concert festival on Thursday, the team could stop and pick us op on the way down.

This has never happened to me before.  >_<  What am I supposed to do?!"

<center><b>DREAM</center></b>

We were getting ready for some sort of dance.  The dance had to have been really soon after Snowball, because I decided to wear Rachel's dress again.  My sister is there, for some reason.  We both get into a car, and drive to some restaurant, where I'm going to meet the rest of the group.  I get there, and my sister leaves.... I think, either that or she just disappears.  I go to the bathroom to do whatever.

In there, all sorts of people start telling me that I look exactly the same as I did last dance.  I was just so sad about this.  I don't know what to do, since my sister left.  I go back to the table, and everyone is laughing at me.  I ask to use someone's cell phone, and after some trouble, I get one.  Only it takes me three or so tries to dial the right number.  I'm trying to call Matt.  The first time, I dial something that's completely wrong, the second I don't remember the last four digits of it.  Finally, I'm actually able to call him.  

He tells me that this is very uncharacteristic for me, and that I should just stay there.  At this point, I'm crying, and trying to make him understand the whole thing.  I hear a noise off to my left, so I ask Matt to hold on.  

<center><b>END OF DREAM</center></b>

And there the dream stops.  My alarm went off, and that's the noise I heard in the dream.  Crazy, ya know?"

I got mostly everything that I wanted for Christmas.  Except a MacBook, but I didn't expect that to happen.  Jenny got me <U>Where the Wild Things</u> are... IN FRENCH!  It's so cool!  

Last night was the academic team Christmas party.  That was a fun time.  It's crazy, playing Mafia with that crew.  Especially with the underclassmen.  Well, really only one in particular, but let's not name names.  :)  I taught CMank to play Nervous, and then lost against him.  That always happens!  I teach someone a game, and then lose!  Nicole and I played out our log plan.  We wrapped it in about five layers of two different kinds of wrapping paper and newspaper.  And then we went over it all with a layer of packing tape.  We even taped a card to it!

Thanks, Jena, for getting us the log! 

Yesterday, Laura and I adventured in Florence.... and got lost in Florence.  We wandered all the way to Boone County High School.  I was all for vandalizing it, but <i>someone</i> had to be a Debbie Downer.  We eventually found our way home though, with my expert navigation skills.  Too bad Laura couldn't find her way out of my driveway going in reverse.  Teehee.  I had to do it for her.

I still love ya, Laura!

We went to Dicks, and saw Tower and his mom there.  We avoided him until they got in line behind us.  :(  His mother asked if Laura was my sister.  Haha, good times.  It's so crazy, she's met Laura before!  She also said she thought Laura was a cheerleader.  That gave me a good chuckle.

So.  Rowan is in the newspaper.  The headline is:  WORLD'S CUTEST BABY NAMED.  It's in the Local section of the Post.  Check it out if you don't believe me.  ^_^  He's really in it, but it's just talking about the crazy holiday rush after Christmas.  It's this adorable picture of him peeking out from behind a shopping cart.  

Well, happy New Year, everyone.  See you in 2007!  I'm off to meet my beau for lunch.  It's hard work being a co-oping college kid!"

I woke up from that nap with a huge headache.  Lol, when I first woke up, I could hear Rowan running around the house and being cute.  I was confused, but then I remembered that we were watching him for Jenny and Stacy.  XD, I back to bed at 8:30 that night.

I feel so old!

About Snowball:  it was a really good time. Even though my dress was HUGE, I danced like a maniac.  I had to hike it way up to walk anywhere, and people kept stepping on it.  The biggest challenge of the evening, by far, was going to the bathroom.  Picture this: a tiny, tiny stall, and a huge, huge dress.  Oh man.  The night seemed to go by so quickly.  It was weird, I hardly got to dance with Lauren, Laura, Sabrina, Ashley, etc.  They love it in the middle of the dance floor, right along side with all the grinders and sex.  With my dress, the middle was a no-no.  Every once in a while, I would turn around and Ashley would be right there.  She has a creepy habit of creeping up on people. 

Before the dance, Matt and I went to P.F. Changs.  SO GOOD!  Everyone looked at us in our fancy duds.  Some lady told Matt that my dress looked stunning.  I love walking into a crowded restaurant in a fancy dress.  It makes me feel like the center of attention.  I got Kung Pao chicken, and it was heavenly.

Afterwards, we went to Molly's and watched <u>Little Miss Sunshine</u>.  I feel asleep really soon into it.  Matt came over too, but he didn't spend the night.  That would have been <i>scandalous</i>.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS, EVERYONE!"

Today was the senior good faith effort movie trip.  Woo!  Our choices were <u>Talledega Nights</u> and <u>Man of the Year</u>.  I went and saw the first... for the second time.  I've seen both of those movies before, though.  The movie didn't get any better the second time around.  Worse, probably.  But it was still fun, being there with all my friends.  Sabrina had the insightful comment of the day:

""It's weird seeing all these people in the same place.""

Haha, she's right.  All the gangsta bitches, the supernerds, band kids.  All in one place.  It's like a time warp!  

After the movie, we went to eat lunch.  Haha, everyone else went to lame places, like Wendy's or Pizza Hut.  We went to Bob Evans.  Oh, yeah.  We were laughing away, being normal high school girls.  All of the administrators and teachers that had went on the trip also decided to eat at Bob Evans.  We only found this out until after we were done eating.  Good thing they didn't hear us.  And I wanted to steal the bread basket, because our food took so long.

It seems like forever go, but last weekend, I was so busy!  Friday, I went to Lauren's birthday party.  Fun times!  We went to the Olive Garden, ice skating (where I taught both Laura and Alex to skate!), and then slept over at her house.  Pretty much the best 18th birthday you could ask for.  

Saturday, I went to the League Tournament for academic team.  We beat both Highlands and Boone.  See, Boone had beat us the first time we played them, and Highlands is the team to beat if we're going to state.  We had a match against Highlands this Tuesday- and we won again.  ...By three points.  HAHA, CAKE-EATERS!  I got fourth in the written assessment for Language Arts, and around eighth for Arts and Humanities.

Sunday, Matt and I had a hot date.  I quite remember what we did, but it was fun!"

"event","This Sunday, Matt and I went hiking in Natural Bridge, Red River Gorge, and Daniel Boone National Forest.  I'm still confused, a bit.  Natural Bridge is a... national.. or state park; while Red River Gorge is.. a national park in Daniel Boone forest, which is not a national park, but a national forest...?  Anyway, it was a fun time.  The night before, I went to Brittany's party, fell asleep around two in the AM, and then got up at six... again in the AM.  Matt picked me up at 7:30, and I slept the whole way down.  He kindly took a picture of me sleeping, so I will always remember the occasion.

We started out in Natural Bridge.  That trail is a monster.  You climb and climb and go up stairs and more stairs, then the trail levels out for a bit.  This is to lull you into a false sense of security before it savagely starts going uphill again.  It was really neat to walk along side a massive wall of rock, though.  We finally get to the top, and the view is amazing!  Too bad I'm afraid of heights, though.

I laid down on the rock, and just stared up at the sky.  I would be so much less stressed if I could do that more often.  Matt kept offering to hold my feet, so I could hang off the edge and look over.  The view was nice, but not that nice.  It was crazy, there were no many carvings on top of it.  We walked around it to a point called ""Lover's Leap.""  I don't understand... Do lovers leap from there in a fit of passion?

On the way back down, Matt decided to play Pathfinder, and make our own trail.  Too bad the trees, the underbrush, and the slant of the land didn't play along.  He got so cut up.  My very own trailblazer in shining armor!  We had to use his belt to slide down this wet and mossy boulder.  My ass was so wet and dirty...  We came out of the trees and brush in this huge valley where the poles for the ski lift (you know, the one that lazy tourists take?) to the top are grounded.

Daniel Boone was a lot easier.  But the scenery wasn't as impressive.  Nice, but no cigar, ya know?  We found a neat little pseudo-cave at the end of the first trail.  I drank some the water I found there...  Hopefully, I don't have Ebola.  

The second trail we hiked was my favorite.  There was a neat little waterfall and lake at the end.  Too bad the water was FREEZING.  I don't think I've ever felt water so cold.  So, I decided, the best course of action was to wade in barefoot.  A mistake, in retrospect.  Matt and I followed that for a little while.  We came to a cute little lake that has a heart-shaped rock on it's banks.  Unfortunately, to best see it, Matt and I crossed the lake at it's shallowest point (which came to our ankles).  He gave me a piggy-back acrost. <3  Coming back across, he stepped into a hole, and went down, taking me with him.

We fell into the coldest water we've both ever felt.  It was hella cold.  Haha.  We hiked a half mile back to the car, in wet clothes.  Matt thought ahead and brought an extra pair of pants.  Me?  Well, foresight is not my ""schtick.""  I took my pants off to dry them, and rode the rest of the way home under a blanket.  So, all in all, it was a beautiful day.  I love my trailblazer!"

<u>For Your Consideration</u> was really bad.  It really didn't seem to have a strong plot line.  A bunch of has-been actors and unknowns make a movie called Home for Purrim.  It was weird, watching actors make a movie within a movie.  It had its moment's of humor, but overall, it was a bad movie.  The ending was horrible.  I won't ruin it, if anyone wants to see it, but it was just so bad.

<u>Babel</u> was, by far, a better movie.  Only, it was so long, and it really made me sad.  This poor family, the wife gets shot accidentally by a little boy playing around with a gun while vacationing in Morocco; their Mexican nanny can't find anyone to watch the kids, so she takes them to Mexico with her for her son's wedding, and then all sorts of things go wrong as they try to re-enter the US.  And then, there's this whole side story of this rebel Japanese deaf-mute teenager.  Turns out her dad is how the gun got into Morocco in the first place.  The girl runs around half the movie with no panties on.

I got a one out of six in my first room (I was the best of the six competitors) and three out of five in the second.  I think I would have made it in if I had gotten a two of five in that second room. 

The solo... well, let's not talk about that.  It was just bad.

I had to be at the high school.. wait for it... THREE in the morning.  I can deal with six, or even five, but three?  I didn't get to bed until 10:30 that night, too.  Sure, it sounds early... but then I had to get up three and a half hours later.  I was up two in the morning to get ready.  XD, and our power was off the night before.  Fun times all around!  But, I had fun at the tournament, and that's all that counts.  We went to Fazoli's afterwards!  It's the speech team ""thing.""  I even made a new friend, and his name's Herbie!

Not too much else has been going on.  Matt came home today after hiking the Continental Divide Trail.  Just in time for Thanksgiving.  We're going to my aunt and uncle's house in West Chester for Thanksgiving.  And Matt boyfriend is going with me.  There's going to be a fun time.  

So last night I was watching Miami Ink.  And all of a sudden, I had a little master plan for all the tattoos I want to get: where they're going to be, and what they're going to be.
I want:

1. A small blue star on the inside of either my left or right wrist.

2. Two small bees (think Burt's Bees) on the back of my neck.

3. Stars around the top part of my left ankle.

4. A medium-sized heart with a henna inside of it, and a crown held by two hands (Claddagh-esque) <img src=""http://www.zoojewellery.com/images/products/2380.JPG"" />

5. Symbol for Gonzo journalism somewhere around my shoulder.

Either they trust us, or don't and want to keep an eye on us.  The beds were so small!  We all got to be <i>good</i> friends that night.  Lauren and I decided that it would be best to all sleep in one bed, so we sort of invaded Sabrina and Laura's bed.  Oh man, it was a good time.

We were all laughing and joking around.  Eventually, we were kicked out.  XD, so we moved our mattress off the frame, and built a little bridge.  Sabrina was very worried that we might break it, so we put chairs under it to support it.  Who knew, turns out the land bridge wasn't too comfortable.

We got up at four the next morning, so in retrospect, maybe we should have stayed in our own bed.  We preformed at eight, and had our best performance we've ever had.  We didn't make it into semi's, which was sad.  We competed on the day with ALL the Texas bands, except for maybe one.  Winston Churchill went on right after as.  Even though we didn't make it, I'm still really happy with the season.  Four grand champions, not too bad."

There are so many offices up for election, that its hard to thoroughly educated about them all and their candidates.  Like.. Judge Executive.  I don't even know who's running for it.  I just hope my Dems take back Congress.  That'd be bitchin'.  And I <b>really</b> hope that Joe Fischer loses his seat.

That man is a tool, and I hate him.

Nicole and I volunteered for Lidna Klembara, who is running against the Tool.  We called people... for two hours.  I got a lot of people hanging up one me.  Rude!  It's okay, 'cause I also got some people who were all gung ho for Klembara.  One person asked, after I had said the script, if she was a Democrat.  I told him yes, and he said ""Well, those people in there now have to go.  I'm a straight ticket voter.  My whole family is.""  It made me feel nice.  I also had some funny names... like Constance and Chong.

So.  Guess where my parents are.  Florida.  They flew down for the day to visit my grandma Helen.  I could have gone.... BUT FOR BAND.  Thanks Wesche.  Father Joe said no one could miss during Grand Nats' week.  I understand the reasoning behind it, but I want to go to Flordia, too!  Speaking of Grand Nats, I can't believe its coming up so soon.

He messed so much up!  While doing caption, he announced Mason for general affect, and then after a pause, he must have realized that we tied with them, so he announces that we also tied.  Idiot!

Annoucning the actual placements was so nerve-racking.  He kept messing them up, and had to start over three times.  Poor Kettering-Fairmont.  Everytime he started over, they had to hear again, they they got last.  And the guy took really long pauses inbetween placements.  Especially inbetween third and second.  It's so... horrible, just standing there, waiting for someone to announce second place.  Haha, Mason got second!  We beat them by one tenth of a point.  Now we know how it feels to beat other bands by tiny amounts.

When they announced that Mason got second, we all went insane!  It was just so amazing.  Our show that night was the best it's ever been.  It's like all the little detials came together.  Wesche said ""I don't need to say anything to them, the fans said it all.""  

We won General Affect, and also Best Percussion.  The bus ride home was crazy!  I'm sure that everyone, at one point or another, sung 'We Are the Champions.'  Laura and I shared my iPod, while Lauren and Sabrina shared Laura's iPod.  We all tried to start that song at the same place.... but it didn't work.  They'd always end up a second behind us.  

Lmao, I got a nosebleed on the bus.  No one gave me a tissue until it almost done, so I'm sitting there, letting the blood drip into my hand.  Gross!  It somehow got on my pants, which is never fun.  XD, Laura was freakin' out.  She, or anyone in her family, for that matter, has never had a nosebleed.  Freaks.  XD.

Next week, is our last competition.  And then I'm finished.  Is that not crazy?  We leaving Thursday, after practice, and coming back... Friday, maybe?  I know we're coming back, and then if we make semi's, we're driving back up.  I think we'll make semi's this year, given how wonderful we've been doing.

And then, Brittany invited me to see a movie with her this Friday because she has six free movie tickets.  Fine, sounds like a good time.  I tell Matt about it later today, and he kindly points out that we had already made plans to see a movie Friday.  So now I have to cancel with someone, and let them know how fucking screwy my goddamn memory is.  Wonderful!  Oh!  And, I forgot that I have to stay after on Friday to help set up for the tournament the next day, so I don't even know if I can see any movie with <i>anyone</i>.  It makes me think, what else am I forgetting?

I feel so drained.  I don't care anymore.  I just don't care.  Little things are starting to irritate me.  I let them get to me, and act stupidly.  I end up saying things I don't mean, and then automatically regret saying them.  People are beginning to get to me, worse than they ever have before.  

I'm not a goddamn home wrecker.  I'm so fucking sick and tired of her calling me a home wrecker.  Sure, it was a funny joke.  Haha.  Yea, funny maybe the first two or so days.  Now its just gotten annoying.  She's taken it to a fucking extreme.  You know what she said to me in Pre-Cal the other day?  She said to me, ""Tyler said he never wants to talk to you again...""  

Hey.  Newsflash:  he's my friend too.  Everyone thinks its so funny.  Well, it's not.  It's fucking immature and childish.  Is this something to get under my skin? Is it something even worth caring over?  No.  But it gets to me and bothers the shit out of me.  Again, just because I'm just tired of everything.

What I need to do is that I need to go somewhere.  Somewhere alone.  Just so I can... not have to deal with anyone.  Okay, I'm not saying that everyone around me affects myself in this way, but it'd just be nice to be alone and think.  I don't want to have to defend or explain myself to anyone.  Ever again."

"event","I worked so hard on that crazy EHAP PP last night.  Almost an hour and a half.  So, when Rachel and I go to present today, guess what?  Most of it isn't there!  All the slides that Rachel did were gone.  I know <b>KNOW</b> that I saved it in its entirety the night before.  I know I did.

So after class, I go to the library to work SOME MORE on it.  And I finish it.  Again.  It was a good time.  When I got home tonight, after band, I check it once more.  You know, just to make sure it's all good and ready.  Well, you'll never believe me, but it wasn't all there and ready!  It was just like what it was in Euro.  Even though I finished it and saved it.  

So, the flash drive is shit.  Just to be sure, I e-mailed it to both Rachel and Mr. Kemper, and then I saved it to a floppy.  I swear, if that goddamn PP isn't exactly how I saved it tomorrow, I will pitch a fit and drop out of school.  It's funny, 'cause you think I'm kidding.  I'm just so tired of dealing with it!"

"event","You know, I have no idea what today's date is.  I know that it's Friday.  I know that because I have a football game tonight.  And it just happens to be Senior Night!  Woohoo!  But, I've realized that when I'm off school for awhile, fall break, for example, I completely lose track of what date it is.  Livejournal tells me its the 20th.  Heh.  Good to know.

So, yea.  Senior night is tonight.  My parents are coming and are going to escort me down the 50.  Super exciting!  Everyone should come and witness my 15 seconds of fame!  Too bad it's got to be so cold.  And too bad that we have to do a post-game show.  No one ever stays, beside our band parents. 

We added so much Thursday.  Like a whole new set at the end of the show.  We make 0:00 on the field.  It's so cool!  Teehee...  We also added a lot of little things, like a turn and a horn move in the ballad, a visual in the opener, a turn in the closer, etc.  And you know who wasn't there?  Rooney!  I've heard so many reasons as to why she wasn't there.  Sick, no ride, boyfriend.  If I was a super bitch, I would not tell her about all the new stuff, and just let her find out about it.  XD, isn't that why Wesche reveiws all the time?  Oh well, it'll all work out.

Rachel's senior girl sleepover was so much fun.  Despite what the invitation said, we didn't get some sleep.  We all fell asleep somewhere around.... three, maybe?  I feel asleep in the middle of <u>Step Up</u>, which was a better movie than I thought it'd be.  We played hide and seek in her house.  It wasn't as fun as it sounds because there's only so many places you can hide in a house.  Laura and I shoved ourselves into her brother's closet.... and it smelled.... very odd.  The whole thing was so much fun.  

SENIOR ROCK, SENIOR ROCK!  RA RA, SENIORS!"

"event","We went to Fairborn and Lebanon yesterday.  And we did really, really well at both.  At Fairborn, we got all the captions, but for Best Percussion, which Henry Clay got.  And... Grand Champion!  Henry Clay was pissed, so I've heard.  While we went to a park inbetween the two contests, they went to a park and practiced.  Haha.  At Lebanon, we got Reserve Grand Champion, with Sycamore getting Grand Champion.  It was their goal to beat us.  It's awesome that bands out their have a goal to beat us, and also not awesome because they actually did it.  As always, it was only by less than a point.  Boo.  But!  We did get Best Guard.

The park inbetween the contests was so much fun.  We played for a little bit, and then wondered around.  We found an ampitheatre!  Chelsey and I started doing little skits.  Improv must be like a beacon, because soon after that, bunches of people came.  It stopped being so much fun when people came and started being stupid.  >_> 

All in all, it was a fun weekend.  If not an extremely cold weekend.  But still fun!"

"event","I hate the cold.  I hate having to practice in the cold.  I hate having my horn seize up and decide to not play above the register.  And... above all, I hate football games and contests in the cold!  Because at least at practice you can wear all you want to keep the hypothermia out (scarves, gloves, hats, winter jackets, hoodies, etc), but all you can wear at a football game or a contest is your uniform, and maybe some long underwear, if you're lucky.  The sad part is that it'll only get colder.  

Last night was the Franken-Carlson debate.  And it was awesome!  Except they really didn't get into it that much.  Only once.  Now, Ann Coulter and Al Franken, that would have been interesting to see.  Coulter is a raving nut-job bitch.  They were both really funny.  Someone asked about spud guns and the Patriot Act, and Carlson spoke about the joys of spud guns for three minutes.  From Franken, I've learned that gay abortions are very rare.  

Thank God!  Haha.  Al Franken signed my ticket.  ^_^!

After the debate, Matt and I, Molly, Nicole, Kara, and Rachel went to Applebee's, where fun abounded.  The whole time, we heard all about how Rachel is now in love with Tucker.  I just don't understand it.  XD, but <i>I</i> still love you, Rachel!

Oh no, I have an exam in American Politics.  Boo, P.Faye.  Now she is also a raving nut-job bitch.  One the written part of our exam, the first question was about the Constitution.  Okay, good so far.  It read: Explain the provisions (and something else that I don't remember) of the Constitution.  Would the founding fathers recognize their document today?

...Did she want us to go through the document, article by article, explaining all of it.  I thought that was way to broad.  But the other questions weren't so bad.  We have the multiple choice part today.  She said we needed to have read all the assigned chapters because the test would come from both lecture and the book.  

Oops."

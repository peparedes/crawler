"event","I went down to the Cavalcade of Lights with a date yesterday. We get there, and are told that the light show (the main reason we went) is not until 8:45. It is 7:00, so we walk towards the stage and listen to Lindsay, a local band, for a while. We decide to walk across Queen, an hour later, we find ourselves at College and Bathurst, almost getting run over by a truck...my fault. We realize the time, and rush back, only to find Stabilo on stage. They turn out to produce quite the awesome set, and a great lead-up to the fireworks. The fireworks themselves, freakin' amazing. Lit off behind the stage and off the top of city hall, they left me in awe. If you get a chance, head down to Nathan Phillips Square sometime in the next two weeks. Take in the local bands, watch the fireworks, and maybe even get some skating in.

Ciao."

I want to make a short film this weekend...Daniel better be free...Max too. Anyways, I should probably be doing something, but I'm not, so HAH!"

Open your music player (iTunes, Winamp, Media Player, etc).
Put it on shuffle.
Press play.
For every question type the song that's playing.
When you go to a new question press the next button.
Some songs fit perfectly.

History wasn't too bad, Media Studies was dead easy, and Chem was long but not too difficult. Though I might be rethinking that once I get the results...........POSITIVE THOUGHTS!

Anyways, Marina came around noon, and we ended up jamming for at least 20 minutes before Jamie showed up. Then we played, talked...and decided we need a drummer and a vocalist. So we're on the lookout for those.

2006 is the year you've been waiting for.  The hard work you've invested in the past is ready to pay off.  Doors will open...perhaps more than you're used to; don't let that go to your head.  Simply accept your fortune with gratitude, and keep working hard. 
 
There's only one red flag in 2006: You're likely to attract members of the opposite sex...in droves. If you're already in a relationship, don't think that ""new"" always means ""better"".  If you're not in a relationship, date only casually in 2006; things may not be what they seem, in romance."

I'm not sure if any of you like Jethro Tull, but Courtney's Dad has got me hooked on them, and I'm trying to learn the solo to Aqualung. The rest of the song is dead easy, but the solo is fast.

I've also got 3 concerts lined up over the next month or so.
Sept. 19 - Pearl Jam @ ACC
Oct. 4 - Jethro Tull @ Massey Hall
Oct. 10 - Paul McCartney @ ACC

I'm looking forward to them in the order I'm going to them though, as I've been a fan of Pearl Jam longer than the other two, but haven't been to a concert yet.

Anyways, school wasn't bad today. My favourite class is a toss up excluding Media Studies. I enjoy History because Peister makes it interesting, I enjoy Drama because I enjoy drama, and Chem is fun because of who I sit with (Sam(antha), Lisa, & Daniel). We'll see which class shall reign supreme. Media Studies isn't fun yet, but I hope it becomes fun soon.

I'm going to go read Aztec, I believe.

"event","I've finally reached the end of my journey! There have been some good times, and some bad times, but over all, I'm glad to be coming home.

The party on Saturday was pretty good. There were around 25 people there, including 6 Canadians (including Daniel and myself) and 1 Australian. The party went until about 2 in the morning on the 1st of May, leaving some drunk, some stoned, and many tired. Sunday was spent cleaning up from the party, and then laying and swimming at the beach. I have a sunburn. Today I spent packing and on the internet. My packing is almost done, but Julien's mum is taking me out shortly to buy a knapsack for my second carry-on for tomorrow. I will finish packing, and spend the rest of my day doing whatever comes up.

I also have a list of stuff I want to do when I get back, and here are some of them (only some because I forget the rest at the moment):
1. Get my G1
2. Get a gym membership
3. Have a birthday party
4. Get back to hanging out with my friends

I must wake up at a quarter to 5 tomorrow morning to get ready, and must be at the airport in Nice at 8:05 to get on my plane which leaves at 10:05. Then a transfer in Paris. Then movies, talking, and whatever on the flight home. I will need to drink many caffeinated beverages. Mum, Don, Dad, and Courtney are meeting me at the airport, so I'm really happy! I'm also going to Burlington on Wednesday to see my grandparents, uncles and aunts, and my new baby cousin. It'll be fun, if I stay awake.

My last days here will be spent fairly well, I believe.

Today, Julien's mum is taking my back to Cassis to take a boat tour of The Calonques (spelling pending).
Tomorrow I have 4 hours of school in the morning and then I'm going to the beach with Laura in the afternoon as well as a bit of last minute shopping.
Saturday is the party, so Julien and I will be preparing for that during the day, and then taking part when it starts at 7:00. Daniel'll be there too.
Sunday will be a clean up and recuperation day from the party, as well as sending those who sleep over home.
Monday I'm skipping school, and will spend the day on the computer and packing (I hope).
Tuesday I must wake up around 5:00am so I can get ready to leave Sanary around 6:00 so we can get to the airport in Nice for around 8:00. I then leave my France family and get on the plane to Paris, and then wait at the airport in Paris for a bit, and then get on the plane from Paris to Toronto.

Well, I'm very excited. ""Why?"" you ask. Simply because one week, that's 7 days, from now, I'll be on an Air France flight. ""Where to?"" you ask. Back to Toronto of course! I can't freakin' wait!!! Daniel and I are planning to get seats, steal someone else's seat if necessary, next to each other on the flight back. Apparently on the flight here he had no one to talk to. I can't freaking wait!!!

The last 3 weeks have been so much better than the first 8 weeks...I've had no school, I went to Paris, I got just about all of my souvenir shopping done...so yeah!

Homework wise...Civics is due the day before I leave, but careers is due the monday after I get back, so that's good. I've almost finished all my stuff for Leaside, and what's left I'll either finish before I go back to school, or just ask the teacher for an exclusion.

BAH! Civics is calling!!!

"event","Hey all!! Just wanted to post a quicky before I'm off the computer for two weeks!

Well the good news is: I'm going to Paris today, I'm on 2 weeks of vacation from school, I only have 5 days of school left, and I return home in 22 days!!! The bad news: I'm only in Paris from today (April 12th) to Sunday (April 17th), I have more school (though only 5 days), I've currently got a cold (which pisses me off because I'm going to Paris a little sickly), and I have to remain here for 22 more days!!!

Not too much happened this week. I was off of school, but I was doing homework for home some of that time. I did get some relax time, and I've found some souvenir shops, so I'm in good shape. Careers and Civics online is pissing me off, even though I'm getting 90-somethings in both, but that might just be because I don't have constant internet access which makes the work harder.

So Paris today!!! I'm going to take tons of pictures!!! Though my memory cards limit me to only 620, so I'll have to choose the best to save at the end of the day. PARIS!!! PARIS!!! PARIS!!! I'm pretty lucky, eh? Well, aside from PARIS!!! nothing else is really going on, and my countdown until I get home is still going strong. Did I mention PARIS?!?! Only 22 more days away from home, the next 5 will go quickly for sure, and I'm hoping the remaining 17 follow suit.

Alrighty, well I'm still missing home, as you may have guessed, but actual signs of homesickness have diminished. I can't wait until my return, and I'm sure all of you are also counting the days until May 3rd. I just hope a party is finally being planned!!! PARIS!!! See ya!"

"event","So exactly 4 weeks, or 28 days, from today, I'll be coming home!!! Is it a coincidence that the amount of time I have left is the same amount of time one would have to spend at a rehab clinic???

Anyways, this week will be laid back, as the entire week has been dedicated to homework. Well, not the entire amount of time that this week holds, but a fair bit of it. I'm trying to get just about all of my homework done before Paris, as I might have already mentioned, and to complete that goal, I have a week left to work. I'm off of school this week due to Julien's exams, which he's REALLY stressed about because he missed 3 months of classes, and he hasn't studied, but I benefit from him having to take them. My civics and careers teachers haven't sent me the work that will need to be done while I don't have the internet, so I'm a little pissed at them, but whatever, I'll do what I can.

PARIS NEXT WEEK!!! WOOT!!! This is THE event of my exchange, and one of the reasons I stayed here for so long. I'm confident in myself that I'll be able to last the remaining 4 weeks with minimal displays of homesickness...I just gotta keep busy. PARIS!!! We leave on the 12th and come back on the 18th, so I believe we have 5 full days there, time-wise. I'm going to visit a lot of sites (hopefully), and will be able to do a lot of shopping (hopefully). I say hopefully because sometimes, actually pretty often, plans don't turn out the way they were...well, planned.

After Paris I have another week off of school, which will be time for me to: finish up some of my homework that I don't get done this week, relax, read, go to the beach, and shop. The week after that is a week of school, but depending on my civics and careers work situation, I might take the Monday or Tuesday off to catch up. My departure party is being held on the night of April 30th, and I'm hoping that it either won't get too out of hand, or else it will get out of hand and I'll just stay out of it (the getting out of hand)...maybe. I'm hoping Daniel is able to come to the party, as I haven't seen him since my last party, which was on my birthday...a month ago. WOW! I've been 16 for a month!!!

Then, 3 days after the party, I finally get to board the plane that will take me from Nice to Paris, and then not too long later, I'll be on a second plane taking me from Paris back to Toronto. I really can't wait until I get back. Although I've asked my mum if I can take the rest of that week off of school, I might come in on the Friday just to see everyone, and then, most likely, will be dragged into class. For the next month or so, I'm guessing, I'll be meeting with different parts of my family for belated birthday and Easer activities, and will be expected to tell the many tales of my trip. I hope I live through the repetition. Though I'm really looking forward to a night of hanging out with friends at the ""Welcome Home"" party for Daniel and I, and I'm hoping that Courtney will be able to come so I can introduce her to you all.

Right now I've just finished my Civics work for 2 weeks, so I'm going to do some research on some of the sites in Paris so I'll be able to have a say in where we visit next week. Hope you're all doing well, even though I heard it snowed over the weekend. I miss Toronto!! I miss you all!!"

"event","I have decided to cut down the internet time that I use here for MSN to the bare minimum. I have realized that having MSN and talking to everyone back home adds to my homesickness, so I have decided against using it so much. I'll still be online a little though, but that will be mostly for homework and checking/responding to e-mails.

No more school until 24 days from now!!! Off next week due to Julien's exams, and I'm going to use that time for homework. Paris is the week after!!! I'm really looking forward to that trip!!! I'm going to try and take as many pictures as possible, and hopefully do some shopping!!! The week after Paris is a week which I will use for finishing up any homework that I still have and that I'm able to do while I'm here, as well as relaxing and hopefully some beach time. The week after is school, and then the week after that I'm home! 33 Days left until May 3rd! I hope you're all counting the days, and have a party planned for the return!!!

Alrighty, well nothing interesting has happend here recently, so that's it for now. Until I choose to post again!"

"event","I now must survive the exact number of days I have survived so far. I've been here for 42 days, and still have another 42 to go. Truthfully, I'm looking forward to coming home, as I'm really missing my family, Courtney, and my friends. School hasn't really gotten any better, aside from the fact that I'm starting to space out and think about whatever instead of sitting there totally bored. OH! There is a group of Irish kids at the school this week, sadly only this week, but I talked to some of them yesterday, and it was really good to talk to someone at the school in English. I was going to eat lunch with them today, but I couldn't find them, and so I will try again on Thursday, as I don't have lunch at school tomorrow. So there really isn't much different here, except I now only have 11 more days of school out of the 42 I'm here, so I'm happy about that. Paris is in 3 weeks, and I'm looking forward to that, and I'm trying to keep my goal of finishing all Leaside homework before I leave for Paris on the 12th. Yeah, so not much going on, not many new pictures, but I should be taking a lot in Paris. Alrighty, well until my next update, though I'm not sure when it will be. Miss you guys, See ya!"

"event","Hello everyone!!!

My experience here is getting better, although school is still boring, I had a fun lunch time yesterday. I need to buy a book, as I spend a fair amount of time reading, and have completed all of the books for school which I brought with me. I'm doing well with my homework, and am either keeping up or ahead of my classes, and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to reach my goal of completing all of my homework (aside from civics/careers) by the end of the first week of April. I'm going to buy the first of the presents I need to buy today, and maybe one or two more, but present shopping is really hard for me as I put thought into what I want to get, but can't think of anything. I can't really think of much else to write. I'd write about what I did everyday, but I'm doing that in a book, so doing it online would just be a waste of my time, and I'd get bored. Thank you to you who sent me the letters, which I received last week, as I was feeling a bit down that day, and it really raised my spirits! Yeah, so, if you have any questions you want to ask about what I've been up to, e-mail me, or post, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. Miss ya all!!! Wow. Only 48 days remain before I'm on the plane home, and only 16 or 17 of those days are ones where I go to school! Time's really starting to fly by. I'm amazed I've survived this long (36 Days), and sometimes I wonder WHY I'm here, or rather, why I'M here. Weird. Anyways, I'll stop now. Miss ya!"

"event","I realized that I won't be able to update you all as much as I'd like, and I'm sorry. I find I use a fair amount of my online time doing the work for my online careers and civics classes.

School's going fairly well, but it's obvious the teachers don't know what to do with me. The last physics class I went to I drew, and after the teacher passed by a number of times and saw what I was doing, he didn't say a word. The French teacher is putting together some vocab and expressions work for me, as well as a summary on a video I'll be watching. The English teacher's pretty good, as she includes me in the class sometimes, and asks my opinions on some topics. All in all, I try to get through each school week as quickly as possible, as I don't enjoy it that much, but I only have 27 days of it left out of the 58 remaining days of the exchange. I'm trying to get through my homework as quickly and as best I can, as I do want to have some free time, but I do have a fair amount of it, especially with my online stuff. I'm also looking forward to the 2 weeks vacation we get in April, as the first of the 2 weeks, Julien's mum is taking him and I to Paris! We also get a few days off while his class goes to Paris, as we're going later, we don't go with them.

So yesterday was my birthday, and it turned out to be alright. My spirits were raised early by a phone call from Courtney in the morning, and that carried me through most of the day. It was not until I was forced of MSN that afternoon that I started to feel really homesick, but after an hour of so of a hilarious game of football with Daniel, Francis, and Julien, and also a cut to my back, I started feeling better. Calls from home were good, and they made me feel a lot better also. Dinner was excellent, and the cakes (3 of them) were delicious. We had to have three cakes as we were celebrating 3 birthdays, and there were 19 people present. Speaking of presents, Julien's family gave me a few, including some chocolate, some books on the South of France, and a CD (which I already had). Daniel and Francis also gave me a huge book on the area, and some chocolate. I waited until later to open my presents from home, which I had received during the past week. I really enjoyed reading the cards, and the messages that they had sent me (they being my grandparents, my dad, Courtney, and my mum & Don). I loved the presents they sent too, although I'm not sure if the phone card me grandparents sent me will work, and the DVD about Pink Floyd that my mum & Don sent I watched almost right after I opened it. Dad gave me some Euros, and Courtney sent me a really awesome shirt, also Pink Floyd, which made me wonder if her and my mum had collaborated on what they were getting me... Daniel and Francis stayed over, and are currently still asleep, so after hours of talking and laughter, we got to sleep.

I find that I'm trying to organize my time here around my homework, which is very important to me, but I've also got to try and remember that I might only be here once, and as everyone is telling me, to have as much fun as possible. I just wish I hadn't been assigned so much homework!!!

I miss you all, and thank you to those who sent me birthday greetings! They really mean a lot. Trying to balance homework and the France experience.

History/Geography was good, I understood it. Math was pretty good too, as we started a new unit, so I understood as it was taught. French sucked as the teacher was talking quickly and I couldn't catch most of it. Then something supposedly like civics, where nobody did anything, including me. Then a work period, where I read.

I also talked a bit with some others today, which was good, I laughed, which is a good sign. Got some mail today! LOVED IT!!! Pictures from Courtney :D

Anyways, I've got to go, so maybe another post tomorrow, but if not, next Tuesday. See ya!"

I got a few more pictures today, so it's all good. I also got to play basketball at the community centre Julien plays for, though I'm only allowed to play during practices, and not games...but whatever, I had fun. :) Got some stuff planned for the week, though I forget what, so I'll update you at least once more before I go back to Julien's dad's house for a couple days where I don't have the internet.

"event","Oh my god. My last night in my bed for 3 months...weird. I'm going to miss you all so much, and I will try to update as much as I can when I'm over there. I'll also be writing a lot of e-mails and letters to whoever gets me their address.

My last night was so fantastic though. First of all, I spent it all with Courtney, which would have made it fantastic on its own, and I think I'm going to miss her most of all. We also went out for dinner with my mum, sister, aunt, and uncle, which was fun.

I guess I need to get some sleep, so I'll try to get in contact with you all as soon as I can. I'll miss you!"

Can you help me with one of my projects at University this year? The unit examines photography in the global and post/neo-colonial era and I would like to look at the culture that has sprung up over the WWW and how like a web we are all linked together no matter where in the world we live and work.

I would like you to take a photograph from your front door loo<span class=""text_exposed_show"">king out at your community. If your door opens onto a corridor then perhaps a photograph out of a window. If you have no window then please take that photograph out on your street. Or if you prefer take it from your work place or school. It can be taken at any time of the day you&#39;d like.

How you take that photograph is up to you, just try and make it a reasonable size.

Once you&#39;ve taken the photograph then turn your camera on yourself and take your own image, or ask someone else to take it for you if you prefer. This part isn&#39;t necessary if you don&#39;t want to show yourself.</span></span>

The photographs can be sent to

projectglobalcultures@gmail.com

Or you can post them here. I have screened all comments and will delete the posts with photographs as soon as I&#39;ve downloaded them.

<span class=""userContent"" data-ft=""{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}""><span class=""text_exposed_show""><span style=""font-size:0.7em;""><wbr /></span>Please would you post a comment here to say that you&#39;ve sent them. I&#39;ve had some problems with the email and I&#39;d hate to miss any of your kind contributions.

Please include your first name, where the photo was taken (this can be anything from a city name to just a country name) and what time it was taken. You can add a little about how you use the WWW or about yourself if you wish.

Please pass this link onto your friends and your friend&#39;s friends. The more the merrier </span></span>

And finally ... for now at least ....

I know people are very protective about their online identities and what they are willing to share with people online. Not everyone wants people to know where they live or what it looks like in their location.

So I just wanted to reassure you that this project is only for my university course. It will only be shared with tutors and those in my class. I have NO intention of putting it online or sharing photographs sent with anyone else.

I&#39;ve asked for a location but this can be very general, such as a city name or even a state or county name. I&#39;ve also asked for a photo of you, but once again, if you prefer not to then please ignore this.

Once again, thanks for taking part."

Did I tell you that I got through the first half of my uni course with three As in my three marked assignments? *g* Not sure that&#39;s going to continue for the second half.

Been thinking quite a bit about Harry and Draco recently and then last Sunday Torvill and Dean danced to <i>Never Tear Us Apart</i> and that made me want to find the boys even more. Wish we were back in the days before Deathly Hallows was published.

"event","I just remembered about this today and wanted to read my old entries. It's funny that I wrote these back in 8th grade, and I haven't even changed much (sadly). Since the myspace (and facebook) takeover of the internet it was hard not to give in at one point. I know no one reads this thing anymore and probably everyone forgot about this site in general unless you bring it up, then they would be like ""Yea I remember that, when everyone did that in middle school"". 

Apparently times have changed and so have people. I know my taste in music really has evolved past the Bloodhound Gang (Which have actually have gained popularity with many many kids now, and back in 8th grade I was like one of the only kids to even know of them, funny). I look at my friends on this livejournal and realize that I'm not even remotely in contact with them anymore, but that's just the way things go I guess. 

Anyways, I'm really just posting this entry for myself since I know no one reads this thing. I want to come back here a few years from now and read it over again just to be reminded. Ahh, the past was such a good time."

"event","Well lets start off, my summer was fine. On a scale from 1 to 10 its was a 7. I'm pissed about going back to school because I like summer and school sucks. I know for a fact no one reads this except maybe one other person, everyone uses myspace now anyways which is full of emo fags so I dont go there. Well anyways the next time you can expect to see another entry will be 2006 probably. Not that anyone cares/sees this anyways."

"event","You may recall in an earlier update i told you about the pictures i put in the turn in folder in computers class, well, I finally got in trouble for it after 2 months

We put it up on the projector while the teacher was helping someone and the whole class started laughing and she saw it. She was litterally pissed. She said ""I swaer im going to find out who did this. Well ture to her word she did. Tomorrow i gotta see the assistant principal again to get my consequences

Excluding that my day was fine :D"

"event","YESSSSSS, spring break is finally here, and I couldn't be happier. The only place I'm going on vacation to is my bed to catch up on some much needed sleep (Actaully ill probably get less sleep than I do on school nights) Well all I care about is not having to wake up early. Tomorrow I *should* be going paintballing and that should be fun. Hmmm what else, sometime this week I'm going to Brunswick Zone to play some gamezzzzz. Yep, this will be a great spring break :) (No im not being sarcastic)"

Yesterday I did too much funny stuff to write so Ill just put the funniest ones

- I almost got a detention from Miss Rozanske becasue she found out that it was me blasting Arnold Schwarzeneggar sounds from the computer.

- When I was at my friend Ryan's house we were playing badmitton outside on his deck even though it was cold, and when I went to hit the thing on the last serve I slipped on some ice and just fell sideways, it was hilarious even though it happened to me :D

- Screamed some random stuff in some of my classes

Yea thats about the funny stuff that happened, and also I slept over Ryan's house too which was fun, I don't want to go abck to school monday :("

"event","A lot of more funny stuff happened today, I drew on another kid's picture and put it in the turn in folder during computers. I also sent the two I put in there yesterday to my house so I have them now :D

Another thing is that most people that go to my school know, that kid brought an airsoft gun to school, I knew he had it on the bus but I didn't know he would get in trouble, yes I ride his bus, or should I say he rides my bus, because I own the bus foo.

Yea and its so weird that a girl brought a real gun to a different school yesterday and the same day that kid brought an airsoft gun to ours, must have been national ""Bring some sort of gun to school"" day, HAH!

Yea Im not funny, at least I can pretend"

"event","Well yesterday after updating I made a new layout, and since the Bloodhound Gang is so cool I made it with stuff from them. Anyways some really funny shit happened at school today, well its funny to me at least.

I drew on this kid's picture in computers class like 3 weeks ago and today I put it in the teacher's turn in folder, and then I drew on this other girl's picture and put it in there also, I guess she didn't know it was me.

Really funny to me and my friend because we knew the next period she would be putting up the turn in folder on the projector, and we thought it would be hilarious if those pictures were in it. I hope I don't get called down tomorrow :)

Thats about it, except the fact that I flew to space and ate 10 chocolate bars also, yea that was fun stuff

I bet you can guess what part is true, muthafuckas.

And if you actaully read my craptastic livejournal then leave a comment, bitch."

"event","If I want to spend my free time comitting crimes, who's to tell me I'm wrong?  The police, thats who.  I should have seen it coming really.  As for today, I wasted all of it trying to build a realistic scale model of Homer Simpson.  It was going OK until I started working on the torso and realised I'd given him five legs.  Five!!  How the fuck could I have overlooked that??  I mean, I can understand giving him one extra leg, but three?  I cried for a bit, and then went to bed.  Somedays, its just not worth getting up."

"event","So, multi-armed man that I am (that was a lie, I have only the standard number of arms....two), I'm not content with just being the man behind Fabulous Devils (I dont mean I stand behind them cowering in fear, I mean I am them), I also decided to enter the competitive world of Freestle Dance.  Unfortunately I'm terrible at it.  Truly, truly awful.  I came 40th out of 40 in the last competition.  Also, they seemed to take offence at my choice of costume.  Why I thought it was a good idea to spend hundreds of pounds on a lifelike bodysuit of myself I dont know.  Nobody told me just taking my clothes off would have the same effect.  So, with another dream dashed, the next idea is to reach the elite level of Pro Bodybuilders.  If you've seen me in person, you'll know I already outclass Schwarzenegger at his prime, so I dont have to work too hard at this one."

"event","Only one day left til the birthday of one of the greatest men to breathe air...Busta Rhymes.  And also Paul.  I have a special surprise for him, but I'm not sure if he can really use a dog's heart that i've turned into a happy toy with the aid of straws for arms and legs and buttons for eyes.  Perhaps he can give it to some orphan or somthing.  If you, like me, want to celebrate Paul's birthday, then at exactly 12.01 am tomorrow, phone him pretending to be the government, and tell him you know what he did with those pensions.  He will probaly PISS HIMSELF with sheer comedic enjoyment.  Goodnight"

"event","So....that film I was talking about, I decided to give it a punchier title.  Its now called 'Punchy'.  I think the tagline should be ""This summer, watch a dog's heart explode"", but seeing as no dog's hearts explode in the film, it may be a bit misleading.  Some Nazis do, but they are the villians, so its kind of expected.  Also, I took out the part about the time travelling man turning into twenty dogs, and replacing it with a 30 minute scene of a man rolling slowly down a hill.  Some changes are better than others admittedly."

"event","I wrote the start of a short film: 20 Dogs and Only One Heart.  Its about Ko-Ra, a man from the future who has to stop some sort of catastrophe in the past, but as he travels through time, the equipment malfuctions, and transforms him into twenty dogs. However, the twist is, all the dogs share a heart, which is inside the alpha dog, so they have to stay in close proximity at all times.  Panic ensues when the evil mage from the future, Aaltrac, arrives in the present with his dog-vanquishing equipment.  Aided by Josh, a seven-year old lonely boy, Ko-Ra must find a way to stop Aaltrac, stop the catastrophe and reunite himself! Its an inspiring movie about friendship, being yourself, and fighting future wizards.  I'll keep you updated."

"event","Today I had a dream, the same dream I always do - I was the president, except I didnt realise the job involved me replacing my real arms with the arms of a robot named Frank, who constantly belittled my new-found handicap, and used his mental control over my limbs to deliver mighty steel blows to friends and co-workers alike.  I wonder what it means?  Its probably that film I watched: ""Steel Frank and the Arms Of Justice"".  Chilling."

"event","Today I decided to fulfill my lifelong dream.  Me and Alex went to the park, whereupon I dressed as a commando, and went to hide.  Disgusted, Alex walked away.  Cant he see I am a man with feelings?  Nonetheless, I decided to stick to my guns so to speak, and sat in the bushes for six hours.  Fuck, I was bored.  Next time I'll take a book to read, if not a friend who has similar commando leanings."

"event","After watching World Series of Poker all night, I've decided I can be the next poker champion.  Well, in the sense that I can beat Paul at it.  So I used my best poker face (the one where I'm crying), and took all of his money.  Except it wasnt his money, it was my money that we were using as a placeholder.  So basically - I won my own money.  I'm rich!  After that we were bored, so we thought about making a Darth Vader suit, so we could take turns wearing it and pretend to breathe funny, but Paul got scared that George Lucas would come and sue him, so instead he made up a character called Chooky Man who wears eggcups over his eyes.  I didnt think that was particularly interesting, so I went to bed."

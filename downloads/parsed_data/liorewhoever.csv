"event","&nbsp;Wow so, it's definitely been a while. No one reads this, and that's okay. I kind of prefer it that way.<br /><br />Lots has happened and lots has been going on. Live Journal just isn't important to me. I guess it's because I don't have the slightest idea on how to use it lol. I'll learn eventually though and be addicted. Especially because of my friend Jenilee who got me to make an account about two years ago.<br /><br />It's 4:12am and I want to sleep. But at the same time, I don't want to sleep.<br /><br />I've been listening to nothing but the same song for the passed two days. I have been putting it on replay....obviously. I'm not quite sure why I am so fond of it though.<br /><br />Think Of You Later (Empty Room) &nbsp; by: &nbsp; Every Avenue&nbsp;<br /><br />It's pretty much the only song I know by them lol.<br /><br /><br />Omg Cameron is so cute. He is so perfect. Literally. His lips oh my goodness. If you know who I am talking about, I applaud you. If you think I am a weird creeper, well, you're right.<br /><br />Anyways, that was another pointless entry. Hopefully next entry won't be in another year or two!<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

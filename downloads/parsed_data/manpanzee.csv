"event","Mike Huckabee was on the daily show tonight. I will say that I&nbsp;know very little of Mr. Bee, with my only knowledge being a lingering &quot;feeling&quot; that he was super religious, and therefore a nutjob.<br /><br />I was correct.<br /><br />Jon started off the conversation with his usual promotion of his guest's book; its always someone with a fucking book. They then slowly - or maybe just bluntly after boring topics - worked their way to the current marriage conundrum. Mr. Bee is on the side supporting the idea that marriage is betwist a man and woman, and ONLY&nbsp;a man and a woman.<br /><br />Mr. Stewart politely asked, &quot;Why.&quot;<br /><br />That why, as you would probably guess, led to a giant disagreement between them, and Jon giving Mike his own ass on a nice platter; It was nicely garnished with some parsly and frilly decorations - very tasteful.<br /><br />The &quot;debate&quot; went as follows: (M is Mike; J - Jon.)<br />M) Redefining the word marriage is something that would cause problems. (I can't really think of a way to word what he was getting at in any way that would make his idea not sound retarded, thats about as good as that one gets.)<br />J) Saying defining a word is import to social structure and ideologies is weak.<br /><br />[Editor: Mike was, basically, hinting that redefining words is a very serious afair and making it different than it is now would change the structure and sancitity of marriage. Jon was noticably cringe-y and upset at this. I giggled.]<br /><br />M) The population has, again and again, stated that they do not want this to happen. 30 states have put it to ballot, and it hasn't passed anywhere. If gays in support of this idea want to make this happen, they have a long way to go to make people like me agree.<br />J)&nbsp;The sheer notion that people need to CONVINCE&nbsp;you - or anyone - that they deserve fundamental rights, which you agree are given to EVERYONE in your book saying, quote, &quot;Equality to all&quot; - is downright shameful.<br /><br />[Editor: Haha. Jon kinda owned him.]<br /><br />M) The man and woman argument; men and women produce offspring, not women-women/man-man relationships. He even said something involving chromosomes - which I can't even remember it was so pointlessly stupid.<br />J)&nbsp;I don't think he even said anything, this was a pretty shitty point.<br /><br />M) Marriage has been, for 5,000 years, been this way.<br />J) It has not, fuck you. We have changed the definition* many times over the years, and it even used to be that polygamy was neat and cool. I believe he also mentioned that slavery used to rock, but we don't still have that.<br /><br />*This is important because HUCKABEE&nbsp;THINKS&nbsp;WE&nbsp;CAN'T&nbsp;CHANGE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;DEFINITION.<br /><br />[Editor: After Jon finished, the crowd was cheering to loudly to really hear what huckabee was saying, but I think he started to get into how the issue of slavery had nothing to do with marriage. It was a shame he didn't notice, but Jon sort of fucking cockblocked him in every possible way in his quick rebuttle.]<br /><br />Im not really sure why I wrote it that way. Whatever, it looks kinda pretty, fuck you.<br /><br />In addition to this, I am reminded of an article I happened across in the acorn while eating befor work a week or two ago. It was a letter from some shmuck of a person saying - seriously - that its good prop 8 passed because if we taught homosexual relationships AND&nbsp;heterosexual relationships in school, more people would choose to be gay. She then went on to say that would have been bad because it would make the population dwindle from all the people experimenting with homoseuxality, decimating the population because gays can't procreate.<br /><br />I...wow. Just...wow. Impressive. Stupidly impressive. Whats worse is she made a point to say shes not homophobic, and that she doesn't feel homos are a threat. It may just be me, but the <strong><em>entire article</em></strong> suggests otherwise you stupid, stupid, whore.<br /><br />I share with you, dear reader, these two circumstances because I want to point out a very important piece of information: the anti-gay coallation's only real reasoning, it seems, to keep bringing up this shit - is because they hate gay people and don't agree with what they are doing.<br /><br />I have many problems with that, and the people who follow that kind of thinking, but what <strong><em>really</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>truely</em></strong><em>,</em> gets me is that they don't see what should be exceptionally obvious. There were even pro gay rights commercials saying this trying to stop prop 8: What the fuck difference does it make to <strong>you</strong> if some people are butt-fucking or pussy-licking? How does it <u>really</u> affect you if they do that? Do you see it as a fucking <em>disease</em>?&nbsp;<u><strong><em>What the fuck is wrong with you</em></strong></u>?<br /><br />I completely understand not agreeing with gay people getting married; but saying they <strong><em>can't</em></strong> because you don't agree with it is just wrong. There is no other word for it, its just wrong.<br /><br />I recall, as I said, a commerical where two women were talking about the issue. The skeptical one goes, &quot;I don't know what to do about this, I don't agree with it.&quot; And the second's reply is, &quot;I don't really either, but are you willing to strip someone's rights because you don't agree with them?&quot; Then the lady says, &quot;No,&quot; and the commerical is fucking over. I realized, after I was done giving the commerical a standing ovation, that people that intelligent and rational <strong><em>don't fucking exist ever</em></strong><em>.</em> I then cupped my hands over my face and cried a thousand tears of sad.<br /><br />I honestly can't even begin to express the amount of disgust the whole issue brings me. This is so simple. Its so simple! Why are people such fucking asshole idiots! FUCK!<br /><br />Now (awesome job keeping your composure, me), I bring this up first for two reasons: 1) It just happened, like an hour ago; 2) I said I cannot begin to express the amount of disgust this brings me. I wanted to use that as a bench mark for what is to come next.<br /><br />My disgust, as of right now in my story, is <em><strong>immeasureable</strong></em>. This next story disgusts me <em><strong>more</strong></em>. I'm not even sure thats possible, or - if it is - what that means.<br /><br />No dobut everyone has heard of the black friday mayhem that occured this year. I would also hope most people heard about the wallmat incident as well - where a man got trampled <em>to <strong>death</strong>.</em><br /><br />D.<br />E.<br />A.<br />T.<br />H.<br /><br />Trampled: to.<br /><br />I need to mention how immeasurably disgusted I&nbsp;am again, simply because its so...immeasureable. Ok? Good.<br /><br />I read up a bit about it. I had a link to the story in some newspaper online awhile ago, but Im too lazy to look for it again. The important parts were: A) a man died from being trampled (I think&nbsp;I&nbsp;mentioned that); B) the people who did said trampling were upset.<br /><br />They were not upset in the way you would expect. For instance, <em><strong><u>I</u></strong></em> would be upset that I just killed someone in my greed for awesomely slashed prices.<br /><br />No. No, no, no, no, no. They were upset that they could not continue to <strong><em>shop</em></strong>. The police came in and said, &quot;Hey, uh, this is a crime scene now, we need to close the store. Leave.&quot; These faggotlords then began to bitch that they had been in line for <em><strong>hours</strong></em> to get in and that this was unfair.<br /><br />YES. YES. This is unfair to <em>you.</em> How fucking dare that jackass stand in front of you and <strong><em>allow</em></strong> himself to be trampled. Who the fucking fuck does - or did - he think he is/was. REALLY? REALLY? <em><strong><u>REALLY</u></strong></em>?<br /><br />I, again, understand. I understand being upset that you had to wait. I completely understand. I also understand that some - if not a large or even giant majority - of these people were not involved in the killing. What&nbsp;I cannot even begin to fathom is that you are so willing to get 100$ of a fucking tv that you will disregard that someone was just killed because of you being so manical. Just...no. No - fucking no a million, trillion times. You know, I could even maybe accept that they were just so scared and confused that they didn't want to admit someone got killed. The problem I have, though, is that I know people. I know them all too well.<br /><br />No one fucking cared. Or if they did, they had nothing to do with what happened in any way. The people who probably felt bad were the ones who were in the back, and just got news of what happened hours after it occured.<br /><br />That statement is more depressing to me because I am currently listening to a sad sounding song. Curse you, timing.<br /><br />I suppose I could write pages more on this, as well as the gay marriage issue, but I would just be repeating myself - and although I would actually enjoy that for once, it would also enrage me to levels I would not be able to contain, mayhaps, and I would punch or kick something. Instead of that happening, I will go ahead and move onto the last thing.<br /><br />Parents.<br /><br />I've actually thought of how I wanted to write this a million times - I've even tried to a few times, but it always ends up coming out wrong and poorly, so I&nbsp;have to trash it. Unfortunately this is too convienient a post to not tack it on.<br /><br />I say convienient because two of the biggest things I see wrong with all parents these days are shown in both of these stories, both directly and indirectly.<br /><br />The first is religion. Yeah, fuck you, its touchy, but I don't care. I've stated how stupid I think religion is many times. While I do think it is terrible and &quot;only&quot; creates bad things...I have realized that it has one good side. One silver lining. Religion is a prime example of how poorly parents understand their roles.<br /><br />I want to go into this is depth, and maybe I will some other day, but I will try to keep this to the point: A parent's role is not to transfer their ideas and thoughts and beliefs into their child's mind. It could not be more the opposite. You can <strong><em>give</em></strong> them that information, but it is not your job to ensure they accept what you say as the truth. In fact, I would have to argue it is actually your job to convince them you're <strong><em>wrong</em></strong>. Its your fucking job to prepare your child, nothing more. NOTHING&nbsp;FUCKING&nbsp;MORE.<br /><br />Now, what exactly &quot;prepare&quot; means to you and me could differ greatly, but the gist of it cannot be disagreed upon. You need to help your child understand the world, and learn how to live on their own. What most people do, though, is assume that means to prepare them for the experiences <strong><em>you've</em></strong> been through. To teach them to live like you do, accept what you accept, and all-around pantimime your exact life.<br /><br />I get concerned, seriously <strong><em>concerne</em><em>d</em></strong>, when people tell me that their child is &quot;their life.&quot; It should not be. It should be a part of your life, not define it.<br /><br />People fucking think a child is some magical gift; that a child is somehow more important than anything else ever. I agree, childen are awesome, I want one pretty fucking bad myself, if not more than one. However, I realize something I don't think most others do: a child - be it mine, yours, his, or hers - is another person. More importantly to realize is that it is not <strong><em>your person</em></strong>. You do not own this person, you meerly made it.<br /><br />I guess there is a tendancy to see something you create as something you must love and cherish because it empowers you; without you, this <strong><em>thing</em></strong> wouldn't be here. Fuck you, and fuck that. You're stupid. Its just the nature of the beast. You create life because it makes sense to keep our species going after you stop. It does not end with you. The whole means more than the individual, all that fucking jazz.<br /><br />Second, derived from the second story (I&nbsp;SEE&nbsp;WHAT&nbsp;I&nbsp;DID&nbsp;THERE), is that people are fucking cheap - in the <em><strong>bad</strong></em> way. 90% of people, as far as I can tell, think everything comes from material goodies. That you need to have billions of friends, hundreds of dollars, and enough applicances so that if you were to make a mock city, you could fill the entire city with applicances as people - each equiped with a normal amount of applicances.<br /><br />I guess, really, this is the fault of our whorish consumeristic society, but the fact of the matter is that few out of the many ever realize that. This ends up manifesting itself in the form of parents thinking their kids needs to be fed shit constantly or they will hate them.<br /><br />Your kid might - <strong><em>might</em></strong> - cry about not having some sweet new shit when their friends are busting out cool gadgets and shit, but fuck them. Don't spoil your kid because you think its right. Its the opposite of right.<br /><br />I'm getting off track. My main point is that people get too caught up in the money = happiness mantra, even if they say they don't think thats correct. And THAT&nbsp;sets a terrible example for their children. It scares me that people can be so confident that they know how to raise a child when they charge stores to save 5$ on some shit.<br /><br />On the topic of saving minimal mulah: Am I the <em><strong>only fucking one</strong></em> who notices that black friday may make a single perchase cheaper, but you usually end up buying more than one thing? Or, even, that it makes you go buy shit you don't really fucking need because its &quot;cheap?&quot; It's a trick to get you to buy things! You fucking idiots are stupid! Fuck!<br /><br />To combine number one and two - making <em><strong>three</strong></em> - parents scare me. They are so convinced they know what they doing, when they clearly don't understand even the simplest part of being a parent: you know nothing. Anything you do is wrong, and you will fuck up. The only way to be a good parent from the get-go is to have multiple kids rapid fire and learn each time, and admit your mistakes.<br /><br />Don't pretend you are the end-all be-all. That you have more say, over everything and anything, than your child does. Remember: you're here to prepare them for shit, not shit on their preparations.<br /><br />I hate saying this shit, because I feel like I'm preaching, or that I think I'm super awesome and everyone sucks (well that ones true, but I'm only awesome because everyone sucks, so I look like a genius-god in comparison). I'm not, I'm just fucking so confused by people because this shit is <em><strong>elementary</strong></em>. Its just so fucking simple, and no one does it right, or even close to.<br /><br />Sure, fine. Fuck you, some people get it right, and I give them props. However, most people are not those people, and therefore my fuck you is justified.<br /><br />Also, I love bold + italics now. Sucks to be you."

"event","Hey, everyone! I REALLY suck at keeping up with this whole LiveJournal bit. Holy crap! Where shall I start...? 

A big part of why I haven't kept up with this was that last semester was HELL! I auditioned to work on a student produced movie, ""Diamonds are Forever."" It got to a point where the director quit respecting my schedule AND gave me even more to do. She offered me not only the lead, but eventually the role of Assistant Director. Don't get me wrong- I loved having the creative input, but it was like the moment I accepted, I did roughly 95% of the work. I honestly came to feel that the only thing she did for the project was rent the equipment and hold the camera. It became overwhelming and life-consuming. I poured my heart and soul into it- location scouting/securing, script changes, production schedules, line memorization, etc. I hated that in scouting for locations and services, I was told to tell proprietors that we would promote them via t-shirts and posters... Guess if that ever happened? Nope, you guessed it- more failure to follow through. See a trend? Finally, at literally the last minute, we finished. It was off to the premiere! About half an hour before I had to leave to meet my costars at the premiere, the director calls me... The movie is lost. She walked away from the computer as the footage copied to DVD (Yeah, bright move, huh?) and when she came back, the computer had magically restarted on its own. This in and of itself is quite ironic, as she had made another film (...another pointless endeavor) in which everything that can go wrong with the premiere does, including the computer restarting, loosing the footage right before the premiere. Convenient? That's what I thought. So, everyone who had worked so hard had to stand in front of their families, explaining what had happened, embarrassed, all so that the director could once again wallow in her much needed failure. What's worse, it instantly became, ""Oh, poor director! She goes through so much!"" Bull. Ok? Bull. It's my belief that you shouldn't be pitied and coddled for things you predict and make happen to yourself. 

The director said that now that things had calmed down, she would sit down, go back through the footage and send out our movie to us during the summer. Guess what? Failed. Again! Yeah... while she was at the library, she walked away from the computer (AGAIN! Didn't you learn the first time?!?!) and came back to find that (shock!) the hard drive with all the footage had been stolen. Yup... So, guess who NEVER gets to see any kind of ""fruit of her labors""? 
The worst part of all of this though, is what it did to me. I became so wrapped up in this project that I lost time for myself, and most importantly, the ones I loved. By simply never being there, I became a horrible friend. And worse... a horrible girlfriend. I am lucky enough to have been able to right these horribly wrong wrongs, and have been blessed with the most loving, wonderful, forgiving friends and boyfriend. Thank you, guys. If I could take back that semester, if I had been smarter, had better foresight, I would have turned that role down. The only thing I don't regret are some of the beautiful people I met through it (Mr. Swan, Mr. Henze, and a few others- you know who you are.=)) I am so happy I met you, though I wish through better circumstances. Moving on...

Ryan and I are still together, and happier than ever. I still thank God daily for giving me the best, most wonderful, understanding man that I could ever have hoped for. He balances me out, gives me what I need, takes what I have to give and loves me no matter what. I love you, baby. Thank you for all that you are, have been and will be. 

I have an AMAZING apartment in Willkie with the two most beautifullest girls in the world! We love it.... No wonder, we decorated it SO beautifully. We pretty much rock it hard. =)

Classes keep me pretty busy- a lot of reading and writing, but what else could I expect as an English major? Haha. I recently applied to work at Author House- a publishing house here in Bloomington. I'd like to work in a publishing house with my degree, so it would be VERY helpful! *crosses fingers*   

My mom and I have been looking at houses in the Martinsville area- we're done with Indianapolis, and waiting to hear back from the bank on an offer we made on a beautiful blue house. Pray for us! I've also been going to Martinsville every Tuesday night to spend some time with Vic and Trixie (my grandparents). It's been wonderful. I am SO happy I can do that. 

Well... I think that's about it. Feel free to hit me up with comments or questions. Thanks for reading!"

"event","Whoo, buddy it's been a long time since I wrote! Since April? Man.... You'd think I have a life, haha. Let's get updated, shall we? 

Let's see... Over the summer, I worked as a Summer Reading clerk for the Irvington Branch Library. It was pretty sweet- I got to work with kids, caught up on my reading and virtually never got up. I took a $4 pay increase for it, too. It rocked pretty fierce. =) 

I got back here to IU in late August, and it's been a wonderful year! I've gotten rid of a lot of unnecessary drama in my life, have bonded even more with my true friends, as well as discovering who those true friends really are. My mom and I were in a really bad car accident on September 15. We were headed to pick up my brother and sister for the weekend, and we got rammed on my side of the car. We spun, and the driver of the other car slammed our front, too. I had to crawl out my mom's side, since my door was stuck in the other guy's truck. Mom and I went to the hospital via ambulance, with my mom on a stretcher. I think seeing her like that was the worst part of it for me, you know? Aside from the fact that I was convinced that I was going to die. I meant it- I saw that truck coming through the red light and I swore I was dead... It was awful. Anyway, the right side of my body was pretty sore- even now, if I sit too long, my hip really bothers me. I also had severe bruising on my lower abdomen, from hip to hip where I had slammed against my seat belt. To this day, my skin is still a little discolored. I couldn't walk right for a long time. The stress of the accident cause a spike in my white blood cell count, which led to a minor infection. My mom was really banged up, too. Her knee was really screwed up, and she had a lot of bruising, too. She told me she didn't feel anything until she knew I was alive, then the physical pain set in. *Side note- Mom recently fell and broke her arm pretty badly. She's a soldier!* But yeah, we're both healed up from the accident, all things considered. I'm even driving again! =-)

Ryan and I are still together! It'll have been a year on the 27th, and I couldn't be happier. He is my best friend and the love of my life. I know it's a cliche, but he completes me; he really is my other half. I have never loved another person as much as I love him, or the way that I love him. I'm still thanking God for him everyday. God knew that I needed him, and He sent Ryan to me in the nick of time. If you read this Ryan, I love you, baby. 

Concerning God: I'm still not where I want to be. I love God, and am striving to be a woman of God, but my goal is to be as dependent on Him and as happy in Him as I was freshman year, before everything happened. So, pray for me in that. 

Ok, probably not as interesting as you would have liked, but that's my life since April. I'll try to be better about all of this from now on....we'll see how that goes. ;-) Thanks for reading, peace!"

"event","Wow.... it's been a while, yeah? Hope all is well with all of you. All is certainly well with me! I've been learning a lot lately, but we'll take it one step at a time, ok? H'ok! I'll just kinda list everything that's happened or that I've learned.... 
1. Ryan. I love him so much! We've been together almost three months now (April 27th), and it has been the happiest time of my life. He's always there for me, whether he needs to be or not. He makes me laugh, makes me smile, loves me, takes care of me, and undoes all the damage done to me in the past. I cannot express how blessed I am to have him. God certainly knew what I needed in giving Ryan to me. 
2. God. He is a kickin' guy! I was in church last Sunday, and it dawned on me (undoubtedly because God made it so) that I am not being the Christian or woman of God that I could be. See, God is a loving God, not wrathful, so instead of feeling like this horrible person, I felt like I was being granted forgiveness and another chance by a loving Father. He's given me so many chances, it's insane. It is my hope and prayer to serve Him in my actions, example, and personal relationship with Him. 
3. Friends. I have BEAUTIFUL friends!! We've gone through a rough spot with someone we all know, and it's been very eye opening. I see them all for the strong, sweet, genuine people that they are. I also want to take this time to say how proud I am of Erin who is getting confirmed tonight!! Woo-hoo! Anywho, I love all of my friends- they are all amazing and beautiful people. Kisses, guys! 
4. Drama. It sucks- avoid it at all costs. Enough said. 
5. I said something recently, and was told that it was really good. It's a long background story, but I had said ""Love does not deceive and respect does not sabotage."" I can explain if you want, but it's  no big. 
Ok, this is plenty long now. I'm going to sign off here and do some homework. I love you all, Happy Easter and Happy Passover! Shalom and Maranatha!!"

"event","Hello, readers and friends! I realized that it's been since October since I last wrote- I figure it's time for an update, no? It's been an interesting few months, I'll admit that. Let's see.... 
I'm thinking of changing my major from Secondary Language Arts Education to either Interior Architecture or Journalism. Ryan says I shouldn't give up on education, and I think I will stay with it. He tends to be right :-)Oh, which brings me to my second update....
I'm currently dating the BEST guy known to man (well, I guess known to woman, all things considered, haha). This just happens to be the aforementioned Ryan. We met at a fire alarm last semester, became friends, and now we're together. He makes me happier than I've been in so long... probably ever. Behold, the power of Ryan. Haha, wow, ok- stop Keeley. 
Update three: my Uncle Sonny and Aunt Lori just had their third baby last Saturday. Caroline Drew Harris Nesbit, aka ""Harri,"" was born 7 pounds, 5 ounces, and 21.5 inches long. Oh, and she's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I thoroughly intend to spend most of my spring break with her. 
Aside from that, I'm working on bettering myself- physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I'm working out three times a week, I'm at church again, and am getting back into regular prayer and Bible reading. 
Overall, I am a happy, happy girl! Hope all is well with you all. Be blessed and keep reading!!!"

"event","Ok, I know retreat was two weeks ago, but forgive me- it's been one heck of a time since then. Ok, retreat was amazing! God *per usual* knew what I need and provided- and thensome! Before retreat, I really felt that I was walk in the desert. I was not walking on the path, and my heart was by no means where it should have been. In short, I feel renewed, and am madly in love with Christ all over again!! Here is what I wrote, humble observations though they are. 
""I sat down to write this out about ten minutes ago, but just now started because I just now know where to start: God is so present, so powerful, so loving, so forgiving, and so protecting. This is what *at least some of* I learned or was set in my heart tonight. 
GOD IS SO PRESENT: ""If you have seen Me, you have seen the Father."" *John 14:8* If we h ave seen Jesus, we have seen God. Every time we look at another human being, we look at Jesus- we are looking at a creation of God, in the image of God. In case you haven't noticed- people are everywhere! God, too, is everywhere; in our hearts, in the hearts of others, and the surrounding creation. We all have areas of life where we need for God to be VERY present, though. What is this area for me? Relationships, hands down. Song of Songs 2:7 says ""Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires."" As I have never had a real, much less healthy relationship, I tend to ""fall"" for every guy that comes around. I think he's the best thing going until something happens and I wind up hurt. Each time this happens I tell myself I'm finished, that God must want me to be single but I always fall again. This is my prayer: God, guard my heart. Hold it within Yours so that in order for a man to attain it, he must truly deserve it and be in Your heart as well."" 
GOD IS SO LOVING AND PROTECTING:""I hold you in My hand, and nothing can snatch you away."" *Does anyone know where this came from?* God says this to us all the time- It is how we live, whether we know it or not. Think about that- seriously. Stop reading for a second and think on that. Almighty, All-Powerful God, Creator of the universe holds us in love in His hand. What could we possibly have to worry about? Not even Satan can snatch us out of the hand of God! Dwell in that- live there, keep it in your heart. Reside in the safe haven of God's loving hand. An unfathomably large, powerful, perfect God loves us enough to clear our debt by sending and sacrificing His perfect Son Christ Jesus , then to protect your renewed heart by holding us in the palm of His hand.""
Ok, it's almost 2 am now, so I'm wrapping this up for now. I'll add on later. *Maranatha*"

"event","Good afternoon! It's about 4:20, and I'm updating this journal because I have nothing else to do...sort of. I have something to confess: I'm struggling in my walk. A lot of smaller factors have been snowballing, and now I feel so separate from God. Not that I believe any less, or love Him less, but my passion, my fire is gone. 
I have been so busy this week with school work that it's been hard to even get a decent amount of sleep. I just took my first nap in over a week today. 
I also got my nose pierced two weeks ago and my family has really been giving me grief for it. They assume that because I did that, I'm for sure only going downhill. This hurts beyond description- I feel like they must not know me like I thought they did. I know I have my friends and God, but when you feel like your family doesn't know you, you feel alone. And right now, that's how I feel. I love my family-- do not get the wrong impression!! My family is just awesome. I really could not pray for more, they are my life! Right now, though, they just aren't reacting well to a decision I made of my own volition. 
There are other things as well, but I won't bore you... I'm really looking forward to fall retreat *we leave tomorrow*, as it will be a weekend of nothing but loving, worshiping, and listening to God. My soul is craving it, ""my flesh cries out"" for it even. I just want to get back to the heart of God, the heart of Jesus, the heart of LIFE. Apart from Christ, there is no life. Believe me, I know- I've found this out. Once you know Him, going back and living as though you're without is Hell. So, if you could, keep me in your prayers this weekend, along with all of the other retreatants. Thanks for reading, caring, and praying. Christ's peace!"

"event","So, God has really been speaking to me lately. Main lesson: ""Keeley, trust Me. I made you, I designed your life, I know who you are to become, who you are to marry, and the life you will lead for Me. Let go of your worries...It's pretty pointless to worry about something when I have perfect control."" Sounds easy to grasp, doesn't it? Yeah.....Not at all. See, I know how I want my life to be. I know my dreams and my desires, and that's what I want. However, God also knows my dreams and desires as well as what will be. He knows because it's His plan. It is perfect, precise, and designed especially for me. I seriously need to learn to let go of things. It is on God's hands. If I trust Him with my soul and my eternity, why not with my life on Earth? I'm working on it, praying on it, but I feel like I'm not making much progress. I get so caught up in what and who I want that I forget that God has it all lined up. What will be, will be if that's the way God wants it. My prayer needs to be to be the woman God desires of me, and to step back and let His will happen in my life, not my own. I will met the people I am meant to, take the job I am meant to, marry the man I am meant to, have the kids I am meant to, and do the work for Him all along the way I am meant to. 
If you care enough about me to read this, could you love me a little more and just pray for me? Pray for this area. I know all of this to be true, I just need to work harder to put it into practice. Thank you, and Christ's peace!"

It's like a three day weekend, kids! My room is kind of messy. I should probably clean, I can stand my room being messy. I'll forgive myself. I had *what I think was* food poisoning yesterday. I'm all better now, though. No worries!! 
Have I mentioned lately how hard God rocks??? I mean, He is amazing! He provides, loves, gives, He made us!!! He knew how much we as people would suck, but loves us the same.Loves us enough to take His perfect Son, put our sins on His perfect heart, and put Him on the cross. It's humbling.....Indescribable. Not to mention the other blessings He gives us along the way. GOD ROCKS LIKE THE 80S!!!

Summer...It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Not really the best or worst, it was about 50/50. My walk was challeneged, and another jerk entered my life. Funny how that works...My heart strays, I lose sight of the Goal, and the Enemy ensnares me. I learned a lot about myself over the summer, got to spend quality time with my friends and family, and made some money. In a nutshell, Keeley's summer was ok. 

But man is it great to be back here in beautiful Bloomington! I'm now a sophomore here, living in a single that has an adjoining bathroom. The girl I share my bathroom with is pretty cool I guess. Just playing, Alex, you know you rock the casbah!! She and I are going to lead a Bible study this year together. Praise God for such an opportunity! I am so excited to get to know my girls. I only pray to be the woman of God I need to be for them. 

It's wonderful to be back with the old crew, not to mention the wonderful new people I have met. You guys are all so wonderful, and are such a blessing to me. I can't wait to grow even closer to you, and am anxious to see where God takes you this year. 

Ok, well kids, that's that. I promise to be better about updating this thing. Thanks for reading! Have a beautiful day! Christ's peace!"

I started talking to this guy (you know who you are :-)) the other night, and in a few conversations, he was able to convince me that nice guys are out there. He was kind, respectful, and attentive. I wish there were more of him in the world. I really can't relay how great he is, and I can't wait to talk to him again. He is such an interesting person!! It's like, I love talking to him, because I get to learn more about him. I'm sure I'm not making sense, but I had to share. I thank God for getting to meet him. 
My wrist is healing up, too. I think I've pushed myself a little too hard a little too soon, so I may wear my splint tomorrow. 
God is so good! He restores, replenishes, loves, protects, and guides. I know it seems random, but it's so true!! Stop to thank God for giving you this day.

"event","So, I've never been more insecure about men in my life. I thought a man was supposed to pursue a woman, befriend her, respect her, then come to love, court and marry her. Tonight, however, I learned that this is a fallacy in the modern world. Apparently, the only guy that will go after a girl is the one that wants sex or something like it. It is therefore up to the girl in question to pursue the guy. Since he did not come after her, sex isn't the first thing on his mind. I was raised on DIsney movies and fairy tales, where the prince comes riding in on his white horse, ready to fight any battle for the woman he loves. Tonight, I learned, it isn't for her love that he came riding in, but for her body. I know the Bible says abstinence, which until I marry is what I will practice, but how can I ever contemplate marriage if a) guys continue to not pursue me, or b) I have to think that any guy that ever would pursue me merely wants to sleep with me? Granted, I realize that humans are made for sex, God created it. So, it's insane to expect that sex would never cross a guy's mind, but for sex to be the sole purpose of pursuing a girl is heartbreaking and devastating. And I was just starting to trust guys again....A word to the wise: If you planned on pursuing me, please, please work to assure me that I can trust you, and that your intentions are pure. I need to know that I'm loved for who I am, am worth the risk of rejection, and that I can trust you. Even if I don't love you forever, I will always respect you for it."

"event","YAY FOR GOD!! YAY FOR MY AMAZING BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN CHRIST!! YAY FOR RETREAT!! *Ahem* As you can tell, I had an amazing weekend on retreat!! I learned so much, it's hard to put it all into words. God placed such a calling in me for evangelism. Tim, our rockin' speaker made a couple points that drove this calling even further into me: 1. Jesus Christ is not a hobby. We cannot put Him on a shelf when we get busy, then take HIm down and dust Him off when we feel alone or are in need. We need to live Him, have Him in our hearts, and walk with Him daily. 2. Keeping the Word to ourselves makes us just as bad as the Pharisees. Friends, we live on a campus where people are literally dying to hear the ""secret"" we carry within our hearts. We hold eternal life through Jesus, how completely selfish are we to know this and not share it? It shames me to think of it. My goal, and I pray that you consider this for yourselves, is to reach out to someone new on a regular basis. Am I scared? Yes, until I am reminded that GOD HIMSELF IS ON MY SIDE. My Father is with me, what else could possible matter?  That's right, nothing!!
Later tonight I am going to our prayer team meeting. This is the last meeting before the week-long fast, so I'm sure that will be the focus of our prayers. My prayer is that we not succumb to the voice of Satan, who will try to sway us from the prayer-quest we are on. He will try to tell us that we can't do it, that we're not strong enough; I pray we hear only the Voice of Truth, that we can do it, as we do it in the name of God and in prayer to Him. I also pray for humility in our fast; that we do as the word says and keep ourselves well-kempt, and fast only for God, and not the attentions of man. 
Life is so good, busy, but good. God is so fully in my life, His presence often overwhelming me. I pray Christ's peace on all reading this. Good night an God bless. His peace!!"

We had yet another beautiful day, my stress level and work load continue to be very low....Actually, they're nonexistent. Sweet action!! Tomorrow is Thursday, which means five things: It's almost the end of the week, prayer team meeting, CRU, I get to see *him*, and I may get to see Steve. Hmmmm, I like tomorrow already!! 

A source of concern, however.....I got to see *him* tonight. I walked away kind of hurt. He saw me...Even looked at me a couple of times, and never made a move to acknowledge me or speak to me. I was on this track thinking he may like me. After tonight, though, I'm not sure. I'm praying on it, hoping that it doesn't involve me. Then again, I don't want anything to be wrong. I don't know what to think. See, this is why I put up that ""Oh, he doesn't like me,"" wall...It's safe. No worries, no concerns. 

Brother, if you read this, I want you to know that I am absolutely crazy about you. One look from you does more for me than anything any guy has ever done or said. You have no idea what you do just by walking into the room. The highlights of my week are the two days when I get to see you, even though it isn't for very long. My friends mention your name and I giggle like a school girl. The very thought of you carries me through my day, but you have no idea. Do you know why? Because I have been so jaded by guys, made to feel so worthless and invaluable to them, that I don't always think I'm worth the risk it would mean for you to pursue me, to tell me how you feel. So, I am going to let you do this. I am going to let you come for me as Christ did the Church, because even though the world tries to convince me otherwise, I know the Truth. I know that God wants me to be with someone who will take any risk, do anything to be with me. But don't lose sight of how much I care for you, and how badly I want you to be the one who rides in on his white horse to save me. I want that knight in shining armor to be you. Ask me, I'll say yes in a heartbeat....All you have to do is ask. 

Blessings to all who have taken time out of their days to read about my life and got ambushed by my girlie feelings. His peace!!"

"event","So, day three of complete and utter bliss. We have beautiful weather outside, a Perfect and Loving God all around, and I think the most wonderful man *aside from Jesus* has entered my life. Due to past experiences with guys in my life, I've been made to feel wary, doubtful, and to lack confidence in men. For a long time, my key Bible references have been Psalm 118:8 *It is better to put trust in the Lord than confidence in man* and Song of Songs 2:5 *Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires* for this reason. Recently, a wonderful Brother has begun to knock my walls down. I am almost positive he doesn't know what he's doing, but is it wrong to pray that he does? I want God's will for this, but I care for this guy so, so much. I can't help but think that he may feel the same way...Of course, I base this on looks, things he says, and little things like that. I don't want to get my hopes up, but I think he may care for me, too. If you could pray on it for me, I'd appreciate it. 
Ok, so...Stop reading my boring journal ;-) Go outside and enjoy this beautiful, blessing-filled day!! God has been gracious enough to provide us with this weather, get out and enjoy it!!

His peace!!!"

"event","God rocks my socks!!! I know this sounds so corny, so inept for describing how I feel about the Creator of the Universe, but I am only human. ;-) He provides under all circumstances, for all people. For example, yesterday in church, I gave the remainder of my money (which isn't much, I am a college student, after all) to the offering and hunger bank. * This is not bragging on my part, I need to tell you this to illustrate my point* So, I am now broke, nothing too new, haha. So I'm walking to my prayer team meeting last night, and what do I find on the sidewalk? A $5 bill!! I looked all around to make sure no one had dropped it, and not a person in sight. God provides, let me tell you!
Then, at my meeting, we were all praying and I heard an answer to prayer! A brother of mine confessed a lot of things to God, and placed a lot back into His hands last night. This is the brother I mentioned before and had written in his journal in response to his worries. He gave so much of it to God. My heart just absolutely broke with joy for him. This guy is just so, so amazing. He takes my breath away; each thought of him, talking to him, getting to pray with him. Even if he and I are never more than friends, he is such a blessing to my life, and I will thank God for eternity just for his friendship. However, based on somethings that were said and done last night, I am beginning to feel that he may like me, as well. I'm just praying God's will on this, as I do for everything else. Blessings on all who read this!!

"event","God is so awesome, and continues to bless and surprise me daily!! Ever since joining the prayer team, my own prayer life has flourished. I feel that I am in constant communion with God--A first. God speaks to me daily, in the people in my life, things that happen during the day, EVERYTHING!! He loves me and provides for me. This doesn't always happen in ways I am aware of, and it tends to take a while for me to pick up on it, but I do. I fall deeper and deeper into this Sacred Romance with the Lover of my soul daily. I crave only to do His will, live for Him, and to be His pure, spotless bride. 
     I also find myself doing His work more and more lately. Reading the on-line journal of a Brother in Him (whom I happen to really, really care for) recently, I found he was feeling very low and confused about God's will in his life and His plan for him, who He wants him to be with, etc. I wanted to write a note of encouragement to him, and prayed on it. On my own, I probably would have said ""God wants you to be with me."" But in Him, I simply said that God has a bride in store for him, and that I am praying for him. Granted, my actual response was lengthier, but that is among God, my brother, and myself. 
       Well, the point of this journal entry is this: GOD IS AWESOME, AMAZING, ALL-KNOWING, LOVING, PROVIDING, AND PERFECT!!! I pray God's peace on all who read this, and hope you can take a little something from this. His peace!!!"

"event","So, why is it that guys want to use me? Every single guy I'm ever with or interested in (save two--ever)
has impure intentions for me? See, I didn't mind so much I guess in high school. I wasn't strong in my faith at all. But now I am.....And impurity seems to be all that I am offered. I am very much devoted to God now, and have handed all aspects of my life to Him. 
     All I want is for a guy who is Christ centered to see me as a daughter of God and treat me as such. I want someone to pursue me, not that I have to chase after; I want him to come for me as Christ did for the Church. I want someone to think I am smart, funny, sweet, good, respectable, valuable, and hey, while we're wishing for the impossible, let's hit beautiful while we're at it. Someone whose idea of ""sweet nothings"" is quoting Song of Songs, not whispering, ""Hey, baby--Wanna go make out?"" I'm sorry if this seems like too much...I dunno. Maybe it is. My life has shown me that it is too much....Something inside of me tells me I deserve this. I could be wrong, I'm tired and it's almost 1 a.m."

"event","Ok, so Thursday night.....I was in my friend Chris Paul's room and was bored, so I started im-ing random people on his buddy list. One guy and I started talking and kept talking for almost four hours. He was so sweet!!! He said so many wonderful things to me, for the first time in a long time a guy made me feel like I was something special. I know that God made me, and I am created in Him and am by definition special, but it becomes so much more real when it's reaffirmed. I finally needed to go to bed, so exhausted. I hated to quit talking to him, but I was so tired! The next day, Alex, Chris Paul, Erin and I  went on a road trip!!!

        We had a blast!!! We left around 12 and headed for Indy. We visited Scecina (my high school), ate lunch at McDonald's, then stopped in to see my AWESOME mom at work. I love my mom....From there, on to Purdue!! We met some of Chris Paul's friends, I got to see my awesome friend Brian, and we got to go to CRU there. Overall, IU kicks Purdue's....um, well, we're so much better!!! Thing is, I though about the guy I'd talked to all day. I just couldn't forget how good he'd made me feel. I was so happy, so confident in myself.

       Saturday rocked too, except for a little suckage. I got some laundry done, then went to Hillary's surprise birthday party. Alex, Erin and I went to Target for awhile and scared this kid named Ewan.....Hahaha, good, gooooood times! We picked up Nick and Jason and headed to Club Rhino to see Kyle's band. Woo-hoo!! We then went to see the hysterical ""Team America"" followed by Pizza Express!! Before all the rockin' stuff, I talked to the guy again. I was so happy to talk to him....Until he starts telling me about this girl he just met. He said they have the same personality and that he hopes something develops. How hard does that suck??? I know I haven't even met him, but I was into him. I couldn't stop thinking about him. I finally get to talk to him again, and he tells me about some girl he likes......What's worse, I hate being mean and confrontational, so I had to pretend to be excited for him, and I even wound up giVing him advice. Man!! The whole time, all I really wanna say is, ""How can you do this? How can you say all you said to me 2 days ago, then tell me about another girl? I LIKE YOU!!!"" Blah. I hate this crap....I'm still into him. That's what's even worse. I like him, he likes her. Perfect. 

      Other than that jazz, I'm doin' just splendidly. Wonderful sermon today, Superbowl was today, and I got nothing done. Woo-hoo! I'm outro. Love y'all, and God bless!!

"event","Wow, it's been a while since I've written. Sorry, life got a little hectic there for a minute. No, wait---nope, still hectic! 
       I have so much work to do! You know how you have all this work to do, and you're just plugging away on it, then you loose all motivation? Hahaha, yeah, that would be me right now. Except, I haven't really gotten all that much done. Blah! I'm going to see ""42nd Street"" tomorrow with my girls, so I want to have all of my work done. We'll see how that turns out....
       I think I'm getting over the guy I mentioned a while back. I've been seeing this guy around all semester. We'd never spoken, except the first time I saw him he told me goodnight. Since then, I've seen him everywhere, and we just smile at each other. I saw him a lot last night, and even mustered up the courage to ask him if he had a pen. I know, I'm pathetic......I dunno, is it really weird to think you may like someone you've never really spoken to, simply because seeing him and getting his smile makes your whole day just a little brighter? The first guy, on the other hand, I......Wow, mid-sentence I realized that I don't even really know how I feel about him anymore. Just yesterday I was telling Drew how much I liked this other guy. I'm so confused!!! 
       Other than all that, I'm happy. No, really, I am. I have an amazing life, family, and friends. I'm comfortable with who I am, I love my God, and He blesses and provides. Other than closure on the whole guy situation, what more could I ask for???

"event","I haven't been this stressed since last semester! I have a solid 12 hours worth of work to do for my W-280 course, all of which is due this Friday. Then, I have a psych test on Monday. Guess if I'm prepared? Hahahaha, ummmmmmmm.......NO!!! Psych sucks, by the way. It's all about the research techniques used by psychologists, not mental diseases, which is what I though it would be. What a disappointment. We recently studied the case of ""Clever Hans,"" and I thought it was soooo intriguing! Anywho....
       Auditions for the Full Frontal Improv comedy troupe are this Saturday. I am so nervous! Everyone seems to believe in me, I wish I were as confident. The people I love believe in me, so I suppose that's all that matters. 
       I'm dog tired, so I think I'm outro. Peace out and God bless!! Maranatha!!!"

"event","Yeah, so about last  night.....I think I have fallen for someone. What's more, I don't know that I should have. I am so afraid that my feelings are misplaced. This guy has, in the past, been so wonderful and supportive and sweet to me. For the longest time, I thought of him as just an amazing person and friend. Then we went out shopping together, and it all changed. Things he said, things he didn't say.....I spent a long time thinking about this until I was out with a friend, and it hit me. I like him so, so much. 
       There is a difference in religions between us. We worship the same God, we both love Him with all of our hearts. However, I recognize Jesus Christ as the Messiah, where he does not. It's tearing me apart. I saw him last night, and before that hadn't realized the depth of what I was feeling. Recently I gave my WHOLE life to God: classes, personal issues, my future, guys, everything. With all this in mind, I don't know if God wants him for me. This is so hard for me, as I want God's will for my life, not mine, but on the other hand, I want to be with this guy. He's simply amazing, he has so much to give, intelligent, sweet, funny, devout, and I could go on forever. I just wish I knew how he feels......God help me and give me strength to deal with this in Your way, whatever that may be.

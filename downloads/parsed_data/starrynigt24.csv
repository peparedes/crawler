"event","Last night we had Andy's going away party.  He left today for Oregon.  I am very sad that when I return to work on Tuesday that I won't get to see my ""Candy Man.""  My nickname for Andy.  He became my older brother that I never had.  He was always there when I needed him and I hope he knows how much I appreciate him.  I know how everyone always says we'll keep in touch.  On very rare occasions does that actually hold true.  So when you say goodbye or see ya later...maybe that's the last time you'll ever see or talk to that person.  So even though I was upset giving Andy a hug goodbye, I tried to tell him how much he has meant to me.  The words didn't come out too well, but I wrote him something great on his goodbye card.  So maybe last night was my goodbye forever...I hope that it wasn't.  But life is life and it happens."

So today being Tuesday he went into surgery, they put the device in but was unable to completely hook up the device. So now tomorrow they are trying a different angle to go in and hook up the third wire.  Well me being who I am is completely freaking out and not knowing what is going to happen to him.  He is my only Grandpa I have left and I can't imagine loosing him right now.  So I have been out of it the past couple of days and couldn't stand being at work today.  I was able to get out 2 hours early due to payroll cuts so I was able to get down to the hospital and see him longer tonight.  Because I just want to be able to make sure I can give him a hug and kiss and to tell him I love him just in case something does happen.  I just hope everything goes well tomorrow and one day when I get married I will get to have the grandfather and granddaughter dance at my wedding reception.  I'm sending good thoughts and hoping.  So I will find out tomorrow if the device gets hook up successfully and hopefully he will be home on thursday."

It was great to see him and hangout  He showed me around the city he lives in and it's a different world.  If anyone has ever seen the Walgreens commercial with the town Perfect in it...that's where I was this weekend.  Beautiful place and the weather was very nice.  Drive was a little long but it was worth it.  Came back yesterday and we had a dinner party again at our apartment.  Ang made a chicken casserole that was very delicious, Sean made homemade oatmeal cookies (yum), and I made my Grandmother's homemade macaroni and cheese.  It came out ok but it was the first time I had ever made it so I was proud of the way it came out.  A few friends made other homemade desserts that were so yummy.  The night went very well, lots of people showed up and no cops were called...YEAH!!  Now tomorrow I have to go back to work and won't get a day off again til Thanksgiving."

I cooked way to much food, but sent most people home with a dogie bag.  One of my friends brought a guy for me to meet and see if we would click.  But every time I tried to start up a conversation with him my other friend would interfere.  So needless to say me and the guy never made a connection.  Which sucks cause he seemed like a really nice guy and he was really cute.  He is a teacher for pre-K which I think shows a lot about him already.  But oh well guess it was not meant to happen.  The story of my life.  But many thanks to Randy for trying to be matchmaker, maybe he'll find the perfect guy for me someday.

In the Cafe I work at we have been getting all our shipments in to get ready for this weekend.

Which bothers me a lot.  Especially when they leave a message on my voice mail telling me they love me, miss me, and they want me to come see them.

It's going to be huge and I have a bad feeling I will probably get blown up or hit by a firework this time.  Oh well it comes with the job I guess.

There was this lady that came in about a half an hour after we opened.  She said she was in yesterday and asked if M remembered her.  But of course he didn't because he isn't usually in the cafe unless he is backup.  So then she turned to me and asked if I remembered her, I didn't.  It's hard to remember everyone that comes through there.  I always remember my regulars and there are a few people that stick out but most of the time everyone blurs together after awhile.  Well anyways, she forgot to get her drink card punched.  She wanted us to do it today.  M explained to her that we couldn't and he was sorry.  Then she got rude and of course wanted to speak to the manager.  I told her the same thing if you don't get it punched when you purchase the drink there isn't anything we can do.  Then she was arguing with us saying we were calling her a liar.  It's a stupid punch but it's the principal of the matter.  She got the stupid punch and still continued to be a bitch to us saying we were calling her liar and I should have remembered her from yesterday.  Whatever the lady needed to take some medicine.

Later this afternoon there was this guy that comes in a least once a week.  He always wants the same thing.  He wants a medium soy chai latte.  We don't carry non-diary chai anymore.  Every time he comes in and I wait on him I tell him this.  It's like he thinks if he asks enough we are gonna carry it again.  Not our choice we carry what we are told to.  So again I look at him and tell him we don't carry that but we do have chai made with skim milk if he would rather have that.  But he didn't, he walked out of the Cafe biting at his face.  I was so glad to get out of there today, I think if i would have had to stay any longer I would have gone nuts!  I know I already am, but it would have come out.

The was 2 customers all day that were the only ones to put a smile on my face.  One of course was this absolutely adorable baby boy with the brightest eyes.  He is always smiling and laughing when I see him.  Seeing him early in my day was great!  Even though he is to young to drink any caffeine yet he is still one of my favorite customers.  The second customer came later in the day.  He (yes this one isn't a baby) always comes in smelling great.  Just gives me that look and I already know what he wants to drink so I try and have it ready before he orders.  Great customer, always friendly and has a great smile.  Not to mention he always leaves a good tip.  But just to get a smile from this customer is all I need to brighten my day."

Like I'm that stupid to believe he was staring at my chest that long to read my name tag. I'm blonde but I'm not stupid.  My name isn't that hard to figure out.  I don't like guys that stare it makes me uncomfortable.  Then after I get him his cup of coffee hoping that would be it with this guy.  But no it wasn't, I was in the middle of making another customers drink and he interrupts me asking about soy milk.  But addresses me by name like he knows me or something.  But again he stares at my name tag for about a minute before he gets my name out.  I hate having to wear a name tag at work.  It makes you feel like a slave to some of the customers that you wait on.  Like they know your name so you have to extra nice to them.  Sorry but I don't make enough to kiss their ass.  And these are the people that never tip.  Not that getting tips are important but it is nice.  So after I answer his question about why we don't have soy milk on the condiment stand(cause it's a total waste) i just told him next time just ask for it.  Then he comes back to the counter and plays dumb and said he forgot something and throws in like $.40 in the tip jar.  I think I should have gotten a few dollars for all the staring he did."

I'm so excited!  Having my own place again will be great.  Not that the place I'm at now is bad.  It's just not a healthy environment for me.  For almost a year I have been renting a room from my ex-fiance's parents.  They offered, because they still treat me like family.  They both are great to me.  But I know I need to get out.  This apartment is great and it's close to where I work.  I'm moving in with two of my close friends.  This should be great!  But I know me and I'll probably be lazy today and just play on the computer.  Maybe try and write something great.  But I'm not feeling very inspired today.  Maybe I'll goto Watkins Glen and walk the gorge, I feel great and relaxed when I'm there around all the waterfalls."

I of course being the good little barista I am said "" No I'm sorry I'm not for sale.""  Made his drink, gave him his pastry and walked to the back room wishing I could scream.

He asked me what I was doing after I got out of work on sunday because he wants to take me to another movie.  I said I have to be at B.B. at 6 in the morning to work because we have a store meeting at 8.  Then back to my usual work after 10 when the meeting ends.  He wants to go in the evening but I don't wanna go with him.  I just don't know how to tell him without hurting his feelings.  I was hoping I would be able to avoid him.  But I knew that wouldn't last long because he also works at B.B.  I can't believe I broke my own rule.  Never date someone you work with.  I don't want to sound like a bitch if I tell him no.  But what other choice do I have?  I am planning on going to open mic sunday night instead.  I just hope when I tell him this he won't want to tag along.  Sunday is when a bunch of us get together and listen to 1 of our friends perform.  She is really amazing.  Well I could be a bitch and just blow him off but that's not me.  I know I'll tell him that I forgot that I had made other plans to hangout with my friends that night.  Maybe he will not ask me out again.  I just can't believe that he thinks there is something between us.  I can't hurt him by telling him there isn't.  I just wish there was an easier way to do this.  I just hate myself for breaking my own rule.  I just figured why not couldn't hurt to get back out there and date someone.  But I'm just gonna focus on working a lot so I can move out of New York in the next 2 years.  If I meet someone that sweeps me off my feet then maybe I'll give him a chance.  But other than that I'm not gonna waste time looking or wishing I would meet someone.  I get to do whatever I want whenever I want.  Why would I give that up?"

His choice not mine...just wanted to point that out.  I almost fell asleep during it.  I like Will Farrell, but this was a horrible movie.  During the movie this guy kept trying to put his arm around me.  I didn't respond, hoping he would get the picture that there is nothing there between us.  At least there isn't anything for me.  There is just something about him.  Well I'm just gonna say it--there is no chemistry between us.  He is a really nice guy but a little to shy and unsure of himself for me.  I just don't know how to say it to him without hurting his feelings.  Let's just say there is no 3rd date in our future.  I'm not asking for much, a nice guy that can carry on good conversation.

So her friends were all strung out and weird.  And moving in with Ang and Sean(my gay boyfriend) I know that won't happen and I won't have to worry about my stuff getting stolen.  Well I think I rambled on long enough.  I'm gonna go eat dinner then goto bed cause I gotta get back up at the ass crack of dawn tomorrow.

I moved there with my fiance (now my ex). I met a group of great people down there. They treated me like I was a part of there family. Then a year later I had to say goodbye to them...very painful. There was this girl Brittany that I worked with and we became really close. I miss her terribly. I hope to be able to visit her this summer. Then there was Miss Jean(down south it was proper to put ""Miss"" in front of women's name). It's actually cute. She was an older lady but would put any of us young women to shame. She is Irish born and raised. She was a ""substitute"" mom for me when I was down there. Sweet and spunky...I guess cause I'm spunky that's why I loved her so much. She was really there for me when I needed someone. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><EM>When we moved back to New York it was very hard to say goodbye to everyone especially Brit and Miss Jean. I look back and sometimes I wish I would have been able to say goodbye to Jeff(my-ex).&nbsp; And stay there on my own. But I didn't and a few months later we broke up. So, I took a job at this Cafe and met a lot of great people there. I work with a lot of amazing people and I'm glad I moved back to New York. If I stayed in South Carolina I wouldn't have had the chance to meet them. I am also working a couple of days at good ol' B.B. Where again have meet great people and love working with them. My life is full of amazing people but I don't feel worthy of any of them at the moment... Now it's coming to another end of a chapter in my life. It started at the beginning of this month. Having to say goodbye to 2 of my friends at B.B. Jen and Justin...they have moved down to North Carolina. I was at their going away party and had a good time til I had to say goodbye and give hugs. Jen and I of course started to cry. She is so sweet and Justin is that same way. Justin proposed to her earlier that day before we all showed up for the party. She was so excited and showing off her ring. I was so happy for the 2 of them. It's so exciting to be able to do that. The knife in my heart was when she showed me her ring. It looked just like my engagement ring that Jeff gave me. I put on that great big smile and hugged her and told her how happy I was for the both of them. And I am, they are the couple that everyone wants to be. So, I said goodbye a very tearful one I might add. I left the party took&nbsp;two friends home and went to sleep. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><EM>Now in the Cafe we have said goodbye to Heather she is moving to Virginia with her boyfriend. And this past saturday we said good bye to Susan...I'm sad for her to leave but I know she is moving on to bigger and better things. I will miss working with her very much. In another month or two we will be saying goodbye to Rhiannon. She is moving to St. Louis to go to Grad school. It will be extremely hard to say goodbye to her. But I know I will see her again. And at the end of summer I will have to say goodbye to Sparky...he is leaving us to goto Wells. I wish him all the luck but will miss working and hanging out with him. I am not use to people leaving me but rather me leaving them. So having to say goodbye/see ya later to everyone is really going to try my strength the next couple of months. There should be a different way to do this. Not have to say goodbye or see ya later. I hate goodbye's and I know everyone else does too. But I just go back to what my grandmother and everyone else's grandmother has told them...that which does not kill us only makes us stronger. Well by the end of the summer I will either be really strong or it will finally kill me...</EM> </FONT></P>
<P><EM>Saying goodbye is never easy and I wish there was a way not to have to say it.&nbsp; I guess for me it feels easier to be the one leaving.&nbsp; I guess I feel like when I come back everyone will be there.&nbsp; But having to say goodbye to friends that are leaving is going to be harder because I don't know if I will be here when or if they come back...</EM></P>"

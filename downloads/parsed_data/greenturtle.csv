"event","Hey, Sorry I haven't been on. I've been busy with the holidaze. Well it's been interesting. Christmas came and went. No biggy. Then I started to get in arguments with everyone here. It's been pretty crappy. I'm looking for an apartment with my best friend paul. It looks like I'll be working with him as well id not something else temporarally until then. So this sux b/c it defies the whole purpose of coming up here. I have been argueing everyday in some form or another. I broke it off with Kat my g/f. Long distance sux! Don't do it!!! I really did love her and I hope she knows that. I am all sorts of stressed out and wanting to jump out a window. I live a completely dry house. So, I can't even get a drink when I want one grrrrrr. But as my friend Hoover says ""things will work out."" Over the weekend I went down to Pittson PA and hung old with my friends Paul(also know as didd or didds), Tewes(who apt it was) Fred, Jim(who is also one of my best friends). On Friday we watched movies talked and chilled. Diddy's girl friend came over with a bunch of her friends and we chilled. Sat, we went to an early showing of LOTR: 2 towers, after that we went back to tewes's to hang. The girls(Paul g/f Drea or dwea, Alicia, Daniel, Allison, Sue<also known as suze and tewes's g/f>) Came over and made us Spaghetti dinner and then we watched Goldfinger. I got to really know Ali(alicia) We shared a bunch in common and became pretty good friends almost instantly. I kicked her but in chess and she thought she could woop me hand to hand so I kiked her but into the snow too. Then I come home sunday to more argueing and fighting. I'm upset and think I made a huge mistake. But I'm up here now and need to make the best of it!!! Well that's it I'm living in hell and it's like Northeast Pa and BTW!!! IT'S FRIGGIN COLD HERE!!! *hugs*

"event","Well, I'm really starting to think that this was a bad idea. Things are rough already. I don't think that my mother realizes that I'm not 16 any more. She made a bunch of promises, the reason I moved back I might add, that she is already going back on. *sigh* I have to convince my self that it will all get better. This is for the best right??? Man I hope I did the right thing. *hugs*

"event","Well, today was interesting. I spent the better part of the day organizing my room. The good news is that it is done(for the most part). Then at around 3:00 I went down to hang with my friends for the night. I just returned around 12:30. We went and had a kinda guys night. We talked and said ""manly"" things and alla round just kinda had a good night. Then it hit my when we were at my friends house... I got so depressed that I just needed to leave. So my friend Jim ran me home with hopes that my kitten would be here for me. I'm really missing people even though I have been rewelcomed with open arms. Everyone is great and my friendship with my friends seem ever more evident. But it's just not the same... Well I'm gonna go now. *hugs*

"event","Well today was very interesting. I got woken up at o'dawn thirty today to get my brother and sister ready to go out shopping. My mom's boyfriend took me up ot take the Ryder truck back and then we went shopping. Man, let me tell you this man is the worse shopper in the whole world. Me and my brother told my lil sis to tell him that we'd meet him at the arcade... Well he flipped out and i thought he was gonna eat my soul. He got better once he understood.So we went to the mall and got stuff for my mom. I found out that DDR is not nearly as popular up here as it is down there which is good b/c I have no prob finding it with pads!!!*woot* We went to sams club and got stuff and went all over god's purple earth. After we finished that we came home and I knapped. then like an hour later we went out again to do a family thing. We went out to eat and went and looked at X-mas lights. Kinda boring but eh.. gots ta humor the family. So I came home and hopped online to see if my baby was on and she was but I couldn't talk long b/c i promised to take my brother to rent a videogame. We rented tony hawk three and Bloodrayne*woot* (Nazi kiling hotty vampire chick!!!) Well now I'm talking to my kitten and being happy. Gotsa goes!!!*hugs*

"event","I went to visit my friends and didn't make it very far. I stopped at one persons house, my friend Paul's, and made it no further. We talked for three hours just about stuff, like the old days. It was a bunch of fun. I told him about SOLAR and now he wants to find a larp around here for us to play. I mentioned running a Vampire game and he got all excited. So it looks like on Sundays I'll be playing Vampire. LOL!!! Just like when I lived with Will. He is still a great guy and welcomed me back with open arms. Well on a sadder note I am tottally missing my girl Kat. I popped online a bunch to talk to her but she wasn't on :(. It's gonna be rough I can tell already. Not only the whole long distance relationship but the enire move. I'm already missing everyone. *sigh* I have been sleepigng on the couch and want to again tonight b/c I get the comfort of think that it is a body I am curling up to... oh well. I think I'm gonna go to bed now... I'm tired and I'm getting sad. Missing you all. *hugs*

Mom made dinner and my grandma and grandpa came to see me. My siblings and I went to rent a movie and I ran into a couple of my old friends... they haven't changed much.

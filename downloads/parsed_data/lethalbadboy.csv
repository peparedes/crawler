"event","wow, i really need to get these feelings down. i just hate never knowing where to start..........damn its late but after tonight i dont wanna sleep.

1. i met these cool friends from hebron, i love all of them. my 2 friends are dating girls from there...
2. made TONS of new friends
3. been grounded a lot for 'misunderstandings'
****4. started dating val (my gf) on 12-31-04 at around 11pm. im lucky i even got to go. im lucky i even met you. more on that later****
5. finally got my car, license and a cell phone
6. those are most important i guess besides the christmas eve thing, but thats depressing. 

***Valerie***
im lucky i even met her... i was supposed to not be out late and i was grounded anyway, i was really lucky. well tom had some girl (whit) come to valpo and she was bringin a girl with. well i later ended up gettin her number and gettin to know her, what i did find out i loved. shes been around through some really troublesome times with me. i dunno how she does it but i owe her so much for it. through thick and thin she stuck it out by my side and i dont know how to express my gratitude to her. i really like her, im just scared to love her. ive had a rough past and it really effects me, especially with veronica around now. she sounded really upset tonight becuz of me. i dont know if i really can handle a relationship anymore. i dont want to have our relationship based on my own problems. cuz they affect my relationship. i try to do whatever i can to make her happy. i know it works cuz she seems really happy.damn id hate myself if i ever made her cry. shes so fricken sweet....
this seems so new to me. i mean i havent been serious for 6 MONTHS. i forgot wht this felt like. i like the way shes makin me feel but i dont want my insercurities to ruin it. and it seems after tonight they are. damn it damn it 
shes too good for me, im just going to end up dragging her down with my problems. im so insecure because of veronica, i used to have a bad temper and be really jealous person. i dont want that again. i hate hearing her be upset, it really made me feel shitty. and then i feel like its too late to fix it...
damn it i feel like im going down the wrong path.. God, please help me with this one. i dont want to lose her. i just couldnt look at myself right if i ever hurt her and i know i did becuz i just dont know..... god i fuckin suck!
im so fuckin pissed at myself. all you ever did was care about me and i ruined it. i love the way u are, a caring, intelligent, beautiful girl. i dont deserve you, my hearts too damned scarred to do this anymore. fuck im in too deep now.DAMN IT!...

this song is exactly how i feel.
papa roach -scars-    
                                           
                                            
i tear my heart open                         
i sew myself shut                           
my weakness is that i care too much         
my scars remind us                         
that the past is real                      
i tear my heart open                       
just to feel                                 

  translation
my hearts torn open from my past 
and im trying to fix the wounds
i have a big heart, people take 
advantage of that. these scars on 
this broken heart have healed but 
are not closed. so im opening them 
 up because im tryfeel this way for *you* againing to learn to"

"event","well my life is exceptionally confusing. i remember when i used to love updating this just to get my feelings down, now i like to keep them to myself. its only rare moments like these that i actually take the time to study myself and write it. my mom said that she never sees me anymore and that she has this instinct that somethings wrong. i didnt know what she was talking about and then she said that she really hasnt talked to me in a year or so. i honestly had no idea that ive been so seclusive. ive been closing out everyone slowly out of my life and i havent noticed it. i guess the few that have remained in touch with me are the only ones that matter to me. maybe that will change too. i dont know why i am the way i am, its just me. i feel like im a different person then what i let others see. i guess no one really knows me. do i even know myself? why must life be so difficult for me, my dreams and fantasies not in my reach? they fall away like leaves in the wind and are blown away from me. i guess i have been hiding. maybe im hiding from myself as well. do i hate what ive become enough to become numb to it totally? is that why im more violent now and dont care what most think? am i noncapable of living a normal life? i sometimes feel like im falling into a deep, dark hole... is this true? damn it!
im sorry im complicated, maybe its my way of actually having a personality. most people think of me as an idiot or just some shallow guy. well then they have never took the time to really get to know me... i think that i have some substance that makes me not just some typical guy. it made sense to me.
im still waiting for that one girl to take me away. im happy being single, it lets me not be chained down. i can be a free bird that way. i just wish that i could be free of these mental chains and expierence happiness thats totally satisfying. maybe that one can give it to me. ill have to see what time will reveal.

"event","u ever feel like u could be with that someone forever only to have them crush ur hopes completely? i have.. many times. lately there are so many back stabbing low life pieces of shits out there. im listening to this hard song right now thats fueling my rage and my adrenaline at the same tiem. i feel fuckin shit up. i feel like fuckin people up. i feel ready to explode with this pent up shit. watch out..it may be YOU! im sick of u scumbags that do nothin but talk shit and try to make my life hell. im glad to be the center of ur attention though! motherfuckers. 

first off, im not a fuckin faggot. i would never think of it, and never could. how that rumor started is beyond me. any of u ladies wanna test it out? haha 

veronica, if ur happy, leave me the hell alone. i dont need to be sucked into ur black hole of unbalance. i dont want to love you, in fact i think i might hate you. you are sickening and ur mind is disgusting. 

i have more on my mind.. but ill keep that to myself.

what did we learn today?
1) im angry/sad 2) im NOT a FAG! 3) veronicas a sadistic bitch! 4) i cant stand rumors"

"event","wow i have so much to say....
its been awhile..


lets split it into sections.!! yea!

school... grades are good, veronicas a bitch, dont have any real friends. am i incapable of them? i think i push them away more than i let them in. maybe im the one not bein a friend. w/e. i dont give a fuck. you always come and go expectin me to make things right. why dont u for once?

veronica....loves me, hates me, wants me, then doesnt. MAKE UP YOUR MIND! damn ur bipolar. use me, abuse me, and twist my emotions. its what ur good at. fuck you... u are the most concieted fuckin nymphistic bitch i have ever met. ur bfs a fuckin loser with a .......nvm. i wont say anything about that. haha...

sarah...god, i dont even know anymore. im not going to say anything about this since it is things i hold close. im sorry i am an ass. if she only knew, god im selfish. im sorry... this isnt working.

work....good i guess. i had six days off of work and it was hell. 

misc.....found out so much shit, i had my heart broken again. I HATE BEING FORGIVING! i hate being emotional, no one cares about that shit anyway....
fuck this shit! god im so frustarated. cara, i love how ur so considerate. i love being alone yet i hate the lonliness. i hate the dark, yet im attracted to being dark. its so damn confusing and i cant explain it. i dont even want to try. my loneliness is my crutch in life and it works. im a mixed bag of emotions ready to fall apart at the seams. wheres my peace of mind? wheres my life? wheres my love? im a corny ass (not literally). i hate myself most of all.... how can i be so selfish, wheres my meaning? i want to KNOW! and for all u people that talk shit, look down on me or just fuckin hate me, tell me to my face and we'll fix it with my fists...  i hate bein alone when im like this. theres no foundation for me right now. damn it."

"event","well lets start with last friday...school was fine and sarah was cute as ever. well things were really lookin up with her.. i just wish i could see her for once. called her and she was all blah blah. since her ex was with her. oh well. 

sarurday(popcorn fest)... worked 7-12pm i got off three hours early and had josh drop me off downtown. met up with tish and all of that crowd. i later saw cara and she was goin to hang with sarah later. she had a show around 2pm and i watched her. supposedly her boob fell out but a damn sign was in front of it so i missed it!! damn it lol. sarah was there with justin of course. i shouldnt be jealous but i am. im not going to admit that to her. so she didnt see me at all even when i was 10 feet away from her. wow.... i guess im invisible. met up with kyle and tish again later. saw a lambo and a couple custom built choppers.. nice! walked a couple miles to mitches.. had fun there. came home in the malibu. had a ok day. miss you though

monday... didnt talk to sarah at all. i told kyle that im sick of bein takin advantage of. thats how it feels. this may sound childish but i think that i just shy away from her to see if she really does care or just likes me for my looks. she asked me later why i was mad...im not mad, im just hurt. im not going to talk to her about this at school if at all. this needs to get out in person. she never calls, never wants to hang out. supposedly im a 'really close friend' and she doesnt want to lose what we have. ok i mean i know i feel one way, at least i think so. i dont wanna ask her though, im scared about the answer. if she kisses and is all over a friend (me) and thats all there is to it. i dont want to be like that though. ive been wantin to ask her to the dance..but no im not doin that at school either. damn it. 

tuesday... sarah wasnt here. blah blah blah. wow i feel 
immature. ill just be a child for a little while.  it helps keep my sanity intact. 

wednesday..more talks with sarah. im starting to feel bad for how im treatin her. i want to hold her and kiss her and touch her, not as a friend though. thats not fair to my heart...damn it, damn it. opened a bank account, im saving for a car. finally kyles mustang is practically finished. test drove it around. fun fun mothafuckin fun!! kyle talked to Veronica online and made serious fun of her. damn it was funny. hung out with kyle for awhile. aaron had his older bro throwin rocks at him at night. kyle and i could hear it in the woods so we went in there with flashlight and broke it off. veronica came over around 9pm and wanted to know why i was startin shit again.. i seduced her and got her to kiss me on her will . damn im good. we were makin out and shit even though she has a 'bf' damn i miss those lips. she is so pretty. im such a fuckin stud. i dont mean to be cocky but i think i can make most girls satisfied really quickly if they gave me the chance to prove it. honestly they d0nt know what their missin.. haha.. im a cocky ass!

today... talked to sarah a little. everything is confusin the hell out of me . damn it i wanna takl to u so badly. i just wish ...nvm. god i miss the way things were. veronica said that she was upset about me ignorin her today..... i told her i didnt wanna be friends. even though she was kissin me. told u so..  just got off of work. yea!....

later yall im outta here. i gotta ponder shit. peace and love and thinkin about you still....

God i love that girl...

couple days ago at work i got burned by some chemical that eats at your skin. i had no idea what it was till i could see puss comin out. it was travelin up my arm and was lookin nasty.  its better now. today i woke up with a swollen eye. i dunno why but i was pissed off cuz i usually dont get shit like that. oh well, its gone down now. theres been some sickness goin through all my friends at school. maybe they gave me something. i dunno. ive had a sore throat since friday when i swallowed shampoo. 

today at work jason broke the dial for the prep gun. i had to call in tony to fix the damn thing and hes on vacation. i feel sorry for him becuz everytime hes on vacation something breaks. oh well. i closed down at 6pm and now im off for 2 days. damn ive been workin 5 days straight. i need this break. aight. im outta here. peace and love to all....

Women love your ability to be romantic and thoughtful, but guys probably think you're ""whipped."" You approach every new relationship with rose-colored glasses, which can make you vulnerable to getting your heart broken. Not every woman appreciates your sentimentality. Save those sweet gestures for the truly special women who deserve them. A romantic guy like you is a rare breed, so make sure that your woman appreciates you and keep it up!

i got a job finally. i work at soft touch car wash. i start off at 6 bucks an hour and i can get more for sellin accessories and stuff. well i start monday and im excited. i just need to get pants for work.

i stayed the night at kyles house with dan. we stayed up playin grand theft auto:vice city. that game is addicting. i think its becuz the game takes u out of reality and u get to expierence someone elses life. so it takes u away from ur own problems for awhile. emotional therapy.. kyle told off eryn finally... hopefully she gets the damn point cuz its makin tish really upset over kyle. i didnt go to bed till 4:30 this morning. 

i woke up around 7 and we got ready to go to IHRA drag racing.
janes dad and his son went with. the trip was to michigan and it took about 2 hours. we got there around 9. it seemed longer cuz there was no good music. well basically there were a lot of super fast fuckin cars there! there were cars goin 230mph in 6 seconds. thats crazy! then there were the 10-11-sec and so on cars. there werent that many people till later that afternoon. there were a lot of pretty girls and we talked to some of them. kyle had his videotape so we taped races and a bunch of other stuff. the Hooter girls were there and they signed my badboy shirt. damn they were so fuckin sexy. they were wearin their tight white shirts and short, short orange shorts that showed their butt cheeks. hhmm... they were all bendin over and everything was all hangin out. damn im such a guy... haha. one was grindin with me and i was like damn girl.... i kept gettin flirty looks from 4 girls. i finally talked to this one named amanda who lived in michigan. i got her number and everything. guess what, she was pretty cute too. at least i know im not bad lookin as much as i used to. she was kinda sad that we had to leave so quickly, she wanted to see me longer. we were video taping dan makin failed attempts towards girls, it was so funny!
we left around 5 and the top fuel cars were racin then. they were soooo fast that it made the ground shake and cars hundreds of feet away had their alarms goin off. haha
we came home around 7:10pm and i had a GREAT day. i just have a headache. i was blinded by the glares on the stadium and all the cars. i have a ringing in my ears cuz the cars were sooooo loud. thank God im finally home.

i feel pretty happy right now."

my uncle was in the marines before. he taught me how 2 be a quick fighter and how to really fuck someone up if need be all these moves  that would knock sumone down real easily. he also taught me a lot of shit bout girls and how to win them over and a hella lot more. damn i need to talk to him bout shit more. he told me a story about some guy he knew. him and his cousin heard this guy roy upstairs. so they went up there and snuck into his room. he was sittin in front of a mirror lighting matches and touching the mirror with them. everytime he did that hed say oww. well they gasped and roy turned and saw them. he had burn marks all over his body where he was touching in the mirror! they ran away after that. thats some scary shit! he also broke a cast iron pan in a million pieces. thats solid steel! they think hes possesed. and the thing is that hes a skinny ass guy! damn.....thats crazy

the car had problems. the battery was dyin so the headlights would be dim till we raced down the street. that made it more exciting. 

we saw this car that broke down on licolnway. we passed it up and decided to help it out of the middle of the street. a minute later it was gone. weird...

"event","yesterday kyle had another bon fire. like before it was some good times. jackie and mitch, patricia and kyle, jess and a couple others came over. we went swimming and listened to mitch and his guitar. hes going to be great in a year or two.
everyone was sittin around the fire (which was huge). i was jokin around with jess. i hope she knows thats all it was. i think sometimes i take it too far.

 kyle and tish looked happy together. theyve been havin some problems lately becuz of eryn and some other things. they need to work things out because they make each other so happy. its hard being friends with both of them when they're having problems. u know one talks to u and then the other one does and they want u to tell them what the other one said. geez its crazy but i love them both. 

ive read caitys journal and its so fuckin sad. damn ive been takin people for granted so much! i hate my ignorance so damn much its sickening. she feels like she lost everything and its so depressing. im not going to let her feel this way. i should be a better friend then what i was before. im so stupid sometimes. im sorry babe, ive let you down.

last night i was feelin really down. a storm came in around 11 and i usually love them coming. but that storm coming in symbolized my sadness growing closer to my realization. im really down and i cant do anything to help it. i mean i can be happy for periods but when im by myself im more vulnerable to it. when im alone i feel alone. it hits me harder that way. im happy for kyle and tish and everyone else who's with the person they cherish. but im sick of being without the person i care about. and it pisses me off that i cant be with her because of the person she has changed into. i will not degrade myself by being with her. i hate the way things have gone. 

around midnight i guess i just got myself really depressed. i have this cd which everyword he speaks is so true. and i can feel the pain he sings about and i can share it with him. listening to it brings my sadness out of its hole i hide it in. it hits me full force and im knocked down by the weight. how much more can i take of this constant struggle? i listened to it and i went out onto the roof while it was raining. i didnt care. i couldnt feel the wetness or the wind blowing. all i could feel was this ache in my heart. when will this hole fill up??
it was pourin and the musics going and im feelin like i can actually think straight. everything was fittin in and i had some control over my emotion. i havent had that for months! i just sat there in the cold crying. crying cuz i cant control how things in my life are going. crying cuz this pain wont let go. crying cuz im lonely....this weather fit my mood perfectly so it amplified my emotions a lot. i didnt care if i died. there was lightning every 10 seconds and the whole world would light up. it was scary but i wasnt willing to go back inside. i made myself stay out there to let these emotions out like the rain coming down around me. lightning was right above my head and i felt like it was my anger mixed with the rain which were my tears. id pace and then id sit and id think and id cry. i stayed in this fuckin weather for an hour. i was cold, i could feel it down in my bones. i was wet. i was alone, noone to confide in. shit...well i didnt get hit by lightning, i guess it wasnt my time to go. i prayed my heart out and i felt a connection with God. Hes my only true friend. the only One whose love is pure and true. He is my faith. and i found that last night. 

my emotions got the best of me so i went back inside. i went downstairs and got wasted. ive never been drunk before but the feeling was comfortable because i was numb.....it was the first time i couldnt feel the pain. it was so comforting. i was scared though cuz i was eating chips and my dog was staring at me. i thought she was going to talk to me. and her eyes were so evil looking.then i realized just how wasted i was. i went upstairs and sat in my bed lookin up at the ceiling. i couldnt feel a damn thing. i was peaceful for once. i layed my head down and went to sleep.

ive realized that sleep is the only time where i can get peace. ive noticed how ive been sleeping in though i dont need to. its my way of escaping this world of chaotic emotions and people. 

i woke up today with a bad hangover. i felt like shit but i also felt good. things are really affecting me now...


whats wrong with me???


one of the songs i listened to.

RAIN SONG
When it rains I dont mind 
Let me stand here all night 
Did she take her own life 
Let me know she's alright 

And every time it rains 
I feel her holding me 
And everytime it rains 
Are the angels crying 

I'll stay strong, I'll be fine 
Carry on with my life 
I still stare at the sky 
Pray for rain, all the time 
Why'd you run? Did you hide 
Why'd you leave, no good bye 
When the clouds, take the sky 
Does the storm give you life?

And every time it rains 
I feel her holding me 
And everytime it rains 
Are the angels crying 
And every time it rains 
I feel her holding me 
And everytime it rains 
All the angels cry for me 

I'll never be the same 
I'll never be the same 
be the same"

"event","well today i just looked up stuff to play on my guitar. kristina broke one of my strings and i kinda got mad over that. oh well i have an extra. i really wanna learn how to play. i just want an electric guitar with an amp so i can play how i wanna play without difficulty.

veronica called. basically to bitch and stuff. she said that she wants to be with greg and blah blah. the usual b.s. well she said that she would date me and him. im like no.... i wont have u do some dirty shit with this guy then come over to my house and kiss me. i dont need that. she says shes scared but hey... shes 17. she needs to get her priorites straight and stop messing with peoples heads. especially mine since i love her. she showed up at kyles so he could fix her attenna. she was wearing a tight skimpy skirt, with a tight shirt, and some high heels. i swear, i dont know what that girl thinks....!! shes changed, not for the better either. i want my baby back to the way she was before. that will never happen so im not gettin my hopes up . God, if u hear me, i know u cant mess with free will but please help her. she really could use someone to help her. also help her realize that the water she's treading is going to end up makin her drown.... 

i love you baby. i wish u wouldnt do anything ud regret later. i just wish u werent so concerned about money and materials. possessions are just that, possesions. love is a feeling u cannot get from objects. love is something u need to feel once more.....
and its soo close, yet u look so hard that u pass it up. oh well, ur loss.

"event","i went over to kyles around 1:30pm and he was talking to jess. i mentioned the fair and he wanted to go. the only problem was that he was still grounded. we called his dad and after 2 hours finally got a hold of him durin a meeting. haha he was glad that he got outta there. well erin called him and she wants to see him and blah blah blah.

well we went to the fair, rode some rides, couldnt find tish, ate food, checked out some chicks (damn theres hella lot of good ones!!), and finally found them.  i had some chinese food and i felt crappy the whole time afterwards. my mom said i was pale later and that i lookd like i was gonna pass out. i saw some friends and saw sarahs best friend. it was great cuz i havent seen fawn in awhile. then i saw michelle (jordans friend) who told me about greg and veronica. greg supposedly went to the fair and was with another girl. he was all over her and kissin her and stuff. i guess veronica heard about it and thats why she went to my house 2 days ago. i dunno it was great to hear that guys still leave her for other chicks. now she knows what its like to have someone u really like dump u for sumone else. i also bought a double-edged knife so i keep that on me for any pricks that show up.
i got home around 7:00pm. kyle went home and had another great day.

i admit that one of my WORST fears is that im gonna go insane sometime in my life. im scared that one day im going to break down mentally because emotionally i couldnt handle something. it scares me everytime i think about it and ive been thinkin about it lately. im wondering now if this is a phobia or not.
i hope to God that im just being paranoid. think about it, if ur way of thinking just changes. it changes and then u realize ur not in control of how u feel or what u think anymore. u cant control what u say and if u can then u dont mean what u are saying. i dunno.. but i do fear it. i just hope im better than that. 

shit, im just scaring myself now. well damn it aaron, u lost veronica, u lost sarah, ur losing urself. everything around u changes and ur realizing u could lose everything. ur not over ur losses because they were close to u and then they were just ripped away....................i really miss you. i think about u all the time and it drives me crazy. i am crazy though, im crazy about you."

i went to kyles. it was fun. he was sleepin in his room so i just stayed up there with him reading magazines til he woke up. an hour later he woke and we messed around with his car and the schwinn doug gave me. we were shootin off more bottle rockets at aarons house. his dad came out and told us there was a gasoline bottle near and we're like damn, that was friggin close! haha....we started a fire and made hot dogs. more good times man. tish and this 20 year old girl named amber came over. we hung out around the fire just talking having a good ol time.

"event","~when everytime my know it all younger sister thinks she can boss me around and treat me like a child. i hate how she acts like my parent. she thinks she can just come up and slap me, get in my face like my mom, and basically call me names all the time. i always feel like shes running my life. its her way or i cant get what i want. for example, she seems to think that she has to approve my girlfriend everytime i find one. i dont care what the hell she says cuz her opinion is based on her screwed up mind anyway. this girl seriously has anger problems and i hate how she can be cool, but then screw that up becuz of her attitude. grrrrrrr!!!
~everytime i find someone great, sumthing happens and it doesnt work out. now i know im not prince charming. im not great lookin like brad pitt. im not buff like vin diesel. im just me.i am a passionate, emotional romantic. a hopeless romantic some have called me. now that i cant help. me being like that can have its negative effects cuz i always want to give what i cant ever seem to get back in return. 
~everytime i find someone i love(rarely), and i wanna show them, everybody considers it messing around and bad even tho they did that when they were younger.
~i hate being grounded

sometimes i hate being a teenager. i can lose control of my feelings and even though i wanna feel a certain feeling i would feel numb. being numb can be great to soften the blow of pain but it sucks when you love but u cant feel it. i hate the mood swings. i hate being happy and then i lose control when the slightest occurence of something bad shows up. it would take someone mentally strong to control this. im not psycho, im just expierencing the effects of being a teenager. i want to grow up and be free from these emotional bonds.
i hate being judged because of my age. im not going to be put in a category just because other teens cannot control themselves and give the rest of us a bad rep. i am not a typical 16 year old. i am nothing like anyone else."

"event","a day before we went on vacation, i pierced my ears. my parents were going to kill me. they didnt see it till i showed my mom on the trip. she freaked and was gettin all pissed. she didnt want to ruin the vacation so she didnt say anything til after the vacation. i also wrote sarah a letter and bought her flowers to show my appreciation. she wasnt home so i left them on her doorstep. i tried....
i went on vacation. damn i really needed it. with the breakup and veronica and shit i needed time for myself. well we left in july 2nd and went to mansfield. i drove the whole way there (about 4-5 hours) mansfield is where i was born 16 years ago. i missed being there. i felt at home and found my old house and everything. we went to an old mansion that was for the public and it was acres of brick sidewalks and flowers everywhere. there was a pond and fountains all over. i have pics of it here. i saw couples all over and saw how great this place could be romantically. damn... 
later that day, after spending the night in a motel, we travelled to a town before erie, penn. we met up with my aunt and uncle and his kids. we travelled to our campsite which was awesome. we set up our 4 room tent and set everything out. we spent the night there and made for erie later the next day which was the fourth of july.
we had a family reunion and saw our family from texas. it was a good day. it was in a church and randy and i just played his gameboy the whole time. later that night i met 2 girls at the campsite. jess and carmen. so i watched fireworks with them. good times. jesses dad freaked when he saw me cuz i looked like a criminal with my bandana and my earrings hangin all over his daughter. it was crzy! they were cussin and shit. it was funny!
well we slept that night and packed out shit and went to canada to go to niagara falls. now that was an awesome day! i never been to another country before. the waterfall was beautiful. some girl kept glancing at me and i just felt good. we took a boat ride after smugglin into canada haha and it went within hundred yards of the falls. later that night i slept on the ride home and woke up and took over for my mom. i drove to valpo from 2-6am. i was so fuckin tired! i slept in that day. 
when i got home, i took out my earrings cuz i knew i was fucked. they were infected anyways. well i got grounded a week and couldnt do a damn thing. veronica came over and talked about how she wanted me back. i got grounded again. veronica talked shit. now im writing this. 

sarah imed me. i miss her so damn much. geez! shes not really saying anything. figures.... but w/e.

erins parties tomorrow. i wanna go but street car chaos is tomorrow. i dunno, w/e....

"event","well here it is. i thought that id have nothing to say anymore but i was wrong. i have tons of things to say now that i havent written in 2 months.

well this isnt important but its new. ive been growing my hair out to like 4 inches. damn i have never seen myself with long hair since i was younger. i like it and the ladies seem to love it too. haha

well i talked to cara one day and she was talking about chicago. she asked if i wanted to go and im like hell yea. so we went to chicago with 3 other kids and it was great. we went to a unitarian oh i dunno what its called. it was great tho. i felt connected to my inner feelings and they overwhelmed me. there was singing and readings and flower pickings. i liked this 'blackbird' song some guy sang. i just felt connected to my inner emotional needs and i felt really relaxed. well we went to that noodles place and that library again. good times!
then we spent the whole ride back talking about drugs. more bonding moments! haha jk. well i made 3 new friends that night and i hope to see them again. i always have fun with cara.   
shes such a great friend, im connected to her in so many levels.

well, lets see here. one week before schools out, i never would have expected to meet anybody. well bianca happened to be friends with this girl Sarah. ive seen her around the halls and i always thought she was cute. but i was always with veronica so i would never say anything. well bianca told her about me and she introduced us. well she said i was kinda cute and ever since then i just pursued this girl. haha. well id talk to her everyday, findin out i was into this girl. we'd hug and id look forward to seein her next. i was still with veronica when this happened so i was faithful. see thats one thing that seperates veronica from me. i can be trustworthy cuz i valued our shitty relationship. make sense? no it doesnt. i was whack back then. well i eventually told sarah i just wanted to be friends (stupid me) and work things with veronica. well eventually she slipped away (again) towards another guy and im just like fuck it. well i started to hang around kyle and jess more. they always seem to brighten things up when veronica brings them down. well one thursday, i went to her house. dude, it was all good there. i met her parents and everything seemed new. i mean i havent been to a girls house like this in a LLOONNGG time! well we ended up watching 'Spun' and 'Pulp Fiction'. those were two great drug movies. after spun was over, guess who called.... veronica. she was over at my house and she called becuz she found sarahs number in my dresser. scary shyt. well she was goin psycho and everything about how i was her man. it was crzy. well i just hung up on her tellin her not to call back. u know things are always dramatic with that girl. well durin pulp fiction, i realized sarah was lookin at me more. i couldnt help myself so i just leaned into kiss her. damn it was great. u know like ive been used to one thing and then something new. i just felt like ive known her for a long time then. well we took pics that night and i left later around 11. i didnt talk to her til tuesday the next week after that.

( i slept over with my cousin randy at his grandmas. i love goin there. we were playin ape escape and just whoopin each others asses. it was great. well i brought up sarah and told him how much i wanted to be with her and how i havent talked to her in awhile. i honestly missed her. i was under the impression that that one night was just a fling u know?)

tuesday when we came back to school, i was talkin to bianca about sarah, i was a little worried. well sarah comes up and i couldnt help but smile. well i found out i was just worryin for nothing. she missed me and wanted to talk and everything. she held my hand and we walked down the hall like a couple. things were gettin better every second. we met up at caras locker and went to the cafeteria. i just pulled up a chair and held sarah around the waist. i was so grateful! later that day she even kissed me again. i was not expecting that! i went over to her house and things were great again. 
i asked her out on june 2nd. my life got better after that.

well heres the deal, i got out of a 2 year relationship and she got out of a 1 1/2 year relationship. this is wat we wanted to tho. i was going to take everything i learned from veronica and put it into this relationship. we bonded so quickly and even felt love for each other. she said i was the best guy she ever met. honestly this girl was beautiful and she was intelligent. she loves the same things i do. just perfect u know? veronica eventually found out and was pretty upset. i didnt care tho. well i went over to sarahs a lot, went to the beach, rented movies, baby-sat, it was all awesome to be free again. i had no chains to bind me emotionally. i fell in love with sarah and we talked about prom and shit. (i know its awhile away. oh well.) well, veronica was callin and emailin and tryin to break shit up. i felt so much anger i was losing sight of my baby. it was a horrible week. sarah and i got over it and things were great again. long story short, we didnt work things out. she said that she rushed a relationship and thought she should be alone with friends. it hurt because she said that we never had anything in common and that i was too innocent. i thought that was bull, u know? all of a sudden u just wouldnt make up ur mind to leave sumone u loved right and that made u happy? well things ended really shitty cuz it was over the phone and everything. damn, damn"

yesterday night veronica came over! omfg im sick of this shit dude... at school, at home, wherever i go i cant have peace and serenity. its like i cant even be in my damn room without having her there talkin about her bf or why we didnt work out. YOUVE been tellin me that for a fuckin month yo, get over it! then my sister, whos always been sticking up for me just takes veronicas side and starts shit with me. what a back stabber! so now veronica just comes over whenever she wants and i cant have peace anywhere. god i just left the house at 10:50pm and was thinkin about running away. i know that doesnt solve anything but hey, i mean it works temporarily. where would i go? i have no one to turn to right now. i just walked around the block and had a smoke. haha i could never picture myself puffin cuz of stress, but hey u learn from ur parents all the time. thanks mom and dad. i love u. yea, doug prolly saw me(my next door neighbor) he was just sittin next to his garage when i threw my cig away. haha almost busted. well we started talkin in the rain till 11:40. funny, the weather always matches my mood. i dunno what i was freakin out about but all i know is when veronica came over i was getting upset and aggravated and my heart was beatin faster. thats what happens when u trust sumone to never hurt u. either they do or they dont. in my case, she did. damn, love hurts yo.

cara never called, she never does... supposedly we were chillin today. o well she prolly lies to me to let me off lightly. haha she aint the first."

anyways.. veronica came over thursday. kyle was over basically the whole week and that helped. she came over for only two pics. damn her. she was talkin about her bf again. ggrr! like how they're talkin about prom next year. god u know, keep that shit to urself. i couldnt wait till she left  but then i wanted her to stay. God i love that girl but i could never go back with her. i feel like ive been pushed onto a path ive been forced to take. now i have to go down this lonely road til i find my way off. this is makin me more realistic about my future relationships. oh well.

friday i went to kyles and me and the guys hung out. patricia and christina were there too. well C hit her head on the trampoline and her tooth is loose. i feel bad for that. u know i havent realy hung out with guys in a LONG time. i miss days like these. mitch was playin his acoustic guitar and it makes me wonder what that would be like. i think about playing in front of a big crowd and becomin famous with the songs im writin now. ive always wanted that. i should buy a guitar soon.

i heard that jess was all pissed becuz i was 'ignoring her' well hey, if shes goin to ignore me when i come to her locker and at lunch, then i wont waste my time. her friends notice it too and talked to me about it today. this life is so dramatic..

i thought things were at a closure with me and veronica and that things were fine. like i said before, i will find out it was a lie. veronica was talkin shit about me again and the hurtful thing was that i was walkin behind her. well she turns around and started giggling like she was caught. wtf?
she said she was sorry and would stop all this nonsense... shes a god damn liar. she came up to me later because of my hair ( i got a lot of compliments on it) and told me that she didnt mean to talk bad bout me while i was there. im like should u do it anyway? and shes like well only when ur not around.... im thinkin well didnt u just say that u were sorry and that ud stop? she said it was only valerie(damn i despise that girl). so what a promise is a fuckin promise and she broke it again. well the teacher and some of the class was listenin and she called me an ass becuz i said what she was doing to me was immature and pathetic. Mrs. schott said to just blow her off and forget about her. trust me, i already forgot about her, she just wont go away...."

yea anyways today sucked. i found out that veronica was dating some guy named byron. what a pussy....damn! she wrote two fuckin notes tlking about this kid and i asked myself why do i care? i dunno why she rubs crap in my face and i dont do anything to deserve it. ggrrrr it makes me so mad that shes content with hurting my feelings this way.

she came over unexpectedly for some closure on our past relationship.
she basically said there wasnt an us and that we both caused our ends to seperate. well i have a different opinion on that. anyways she made it seem like things were tight between us. well ill prolly find out later that they wont be.... she can never let things go. i never did anything to her and i get all this shyt...and what for, just because im me? thats a gay reason. all i can say is that shes changed a lot, a whole lot.

im startin to work out for at least an hour everyday now...
ive been slackin off during this relationship. hopefully this will shape a better body and mind for me. i need closure on my thoughts about this veronica thing. and this will help me for when i need to deal with zach. that little fucker's gonna be saying his last word before schools out... i guarantee that."

today around 7 cara came over. damn i love spending time with this girl. its like i can confide in her and loosen up my life just to the point where it makes me wonder if this is supposed to happen. we went on my roof and talked and that was great just holdin her there. talking about our beginnings was interesting but messed up considering the fact that we both lead fucked up lives now. one more thing in common. 
it means so much to me what this girl does, from holdin my waist to her kissing, to her listening to my thoughts...
when we were just lyin in my bed the candles were lit and my lava lamp was on. it was perfect for the time. well, i started talking to her and then we just ended up looking in each others eyes. next things next and we started kissing. omg ive never been kissed like that before! i just wanted more of them cuz i felt this connection with this girl. eventualy she told me she loved me and of course, i loved her. mmm it was so good kissing her neck and shit. it wasnt what i was planning for the night, but hey plans change right? only this time it was for the better. God cara i want to see u more....

and also she talked about going to jamaica by herself. fuck u know? first of all shell be in deep shit when she gets back and then she wont be able to live there by herself...
and moneywise and everything else u know. god ill miss her and worry about her. i think i might as well run off with her...

damn cara i didnt know i cared about u this much..."

"event","today was saddening...

i found out that veronica has these two juniors that like her so she wears this short ass skirt and a tight short shirt just to impress them. when confronted by one of her friends, she said that she wants to look good for him. damn i hate girls like that. anyone that has to change their appearance just to get sumone to notice them is pretty shitty... especially when u do it slutty.

cara dont talk much lately. i think shes havin problems with josh or her family, maybe both. i dunno but i wish she would open up and speak her feelings, i want to know them. i want to listen with my full attention and let her feel wanted sumwhere, not to just stop talkin to me and dont even stop to say hi. i dunno, she just aint what she used to be like and i miss the old happy loving hippie i once knew. its just like when we kissed and i told her i loved her, things were all great, but now its like yea i dont even see u dude.

for example at lunch, she used to always say hi or talk or at least acknowledge me. now its just a look and thats it.
 ever since saturday again i get the silent treatment. i sure do miss her old self.

....song for my feelings today.....

i waited for you
i died inside my own head 
and i'd die again for you

i'm faded and tired 
completely uninspired 
and i'd die again for you

so kill me with the love that you won't give to me
and pack the wound with salt i want to feel it bleed

i'm searching for reasons 
to keep away the demons
and i'd die again for you
i wish you were near me 
could feel it when you hear me say
i'd die again for you

so kill me with the love that you won't give to me
and pack the wound with salt i want to feel it bleed
you wanted me to crawl so now i'm on my knees

why's it always have to be me 
that's always left out to burn and
i'll never learn

i guess ill never learn..."

"event","u know how ud do anything to get that sumbody u care about to notice u? thats how i feel right now. like no matter what i do im just another blip on the radar. maybe im not what she wants and i shouldnt have to change just to be what she wants. maybe this whole time ive been dreamin of sumthing that will never happen.
its just that i live here in valpo and i might move to phoenix arizona and thats a big distance. all i wanted was to expierence the person ive grown to care about and love with time and she doesnt know that. im anxious to be with cara, i just dont want to be rushing. she seemed different today... i dunno just a vibe i picked up. maybe i just worry too much....
maybe im just bein fuckin paranoid...
maybe im just a hopeless romantic...
maybe im just wishing/hoping for sumthing thats not there...

i dunno what to do or say cuz im scared to scare her off u know? i dont want to be too forward and then end up with nothing. 

....im spinning in a hole of unresolved feelings.....

please save me from myself, i love u"

"event","i had this kick ass time with this girl named cara. i met her in the beginning of this school year and she has grown onto me.
ive never hung with her out of school until today and it was worth the wait. i love every moment with her.

we went to chicago and missed a lecture. that was fine with me cuz i didnt go w/ just to see it, i went to see her...
we then had dinner had Noodles and went to a book store.
sum funny shit went on there, sumthing ud have to be there to see... well ok, this one grandma was walking up some stairs and she was bein followed by some lady. well this grandma let er rip and this lady behind her just kept walkin up the stairs.
god that was so friggin funny! i just looked at cara and we started laughin... God, good times.

now i dont wanna type everything, out of respect but the car ride home was special to me. i felt close to cara, when she laid her head on me. sumthing i was waiting for forever...
GOD I LOVE THIS GIRL!

u know when u have these feeling yet u dont know how to get them out? well thats what im goin through right now and its pretty dramatic. 

i just got out of a long relationship, and so did she. 
i dunno, i feel bad cuz she loves this guy with her whole heart, but at the same time im kinda happy. (As bad as that sounds) its just that this girl ive secretly had feelings for.
i just wish i could tell her and let her know where i stand."

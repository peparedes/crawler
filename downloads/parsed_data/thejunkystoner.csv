YAY!! i cant stand it down here!!  and i miss jeff terribly..just like 20 minutes ago my sister called to talk to my mom and i answered and she was a littel suprised and she only called to tell my mom she was gonna be gone for a few days and then she started telling me about some stupid shit buddy did witch it tottaly fucked up! and i know my sister will always love that boy to death and iv had my sister cry to me b-4 but not like she did tonight..i almost started crying because it was so sad..my sister and my dad never really got along and she's even telling me how she miss's him alot witch came to total shock for me. she wants to be daddys littel girl again. witch i can understand because my dad does love his kids with everyhting he has. i know everyone who knows our family would disagree with me but u have to know my dad like i do. my dad will talk to me about us sometimes and it opens my eyes, he's even cried over us b-4.. he cried when i left one summer from visiting him and thats when it really hit me. i use to be a bitch and always say i hate my dad and he's to strict and all this crap. but when i look around at the kids i use to hangout with and wanted their parents to be mine so bad im glad they wernt.. their lives have gone to hell, their all tied up in drugs and screwin just about anyone they can and stuff. and me on the other hand who had the ""strict"" dad, is doing the best iv ever been. i can honestly say without my dad i would be one of those kids who i thought had cool parents when i use to live down here. My dad is the only reason i love my life right now. He's the one who buys me uniforms and stuff so i can play soccer and he's the one who let me go out with the guy i love ""although my dad would call it puppy love, lol"" He gives me $20 just for doing dishes and cleaning up the bathroom witch i know should only be like a $10 allowence but that fact is its not. and he actually cares about how im doing in school so i dont slip and start failing everyhting, he helps me stay on top. He actually listens now, i mean im sure he always did before but i only wanted to hear what i wanted i didnt want to listen to him because it wasnt what i wanted. now i see his reasoning on most things. and me and my step mom get along real good. i talk to her about almost everything now i didnt notice that shes been through alot of the same stuff too. shes a good listener. and i love my littel brother with all my heart. when im up there he anouys me and i hate it but my mom made a good point and made me think back when i always wanted to be with the older kids with my sisters and stuff and they would make me leave and id be really sad. i dont think i know anyone who dosnt like herbie. he really is a good kid, he has a temper sometimes but he seems to be getting better at it.
wow i think this it the longest entry iv ever wrote..i dont expect anyone to read this i just had to write that all down."

"event","Favorite song as of this month lol

Slipknot- Vermillion part 2


She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
The song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that i have to believe in
All i need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I catch my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't,no
I don't want to be this
But I won't let this build up inside of me
She isn't real
I can't make her real"

But i got to see jeff after school. i made him go to some stupid soccer party thing with me lol..i beat his ass at soccer today so many times lol, but i will give him props for beating me 2 times. after the soccer party we went to this one prep party we got invited to because jeff had to make sure frank was still stayin the night then we ditched that place real qwik lol... went to our friend genes house and chilled there for a lil while. then got a ride back to the party so i was able to get picked up. and while we were waiting all the littel skate boarders were out there was 9 of them lol. and of course jeff started skateing. then jeff jumped into a water fountain and gave me a hug after i ran form him because he was soaking wet. then he decided it would be funny to skateboard in his boxer lol so he did it lol.. i swear he is our entertainment lol...he's great. Tommarow will be me and his 3 months..hopefully my dad will let me go over there tommarow. my dad found out today that i called him a buthole for not letting me go somewhere and he got mad lol...i cant help it though i was pissed. so that might have ruined my chances of going anywhere tommarow.. damn this is long i doubt anyone read this. oh well

Absolutely AMAZING! They both kicked ass and were hilarious, and both managed to fill 2 hours each without anyone even noticing. I swear I have never had so much fun in my entire life, it was the most awesome experience ever. I am no longer an alice cooper virgin.
Oh wow."

On a lighter note, it is now 12 days till I go to see Alice Cooper in Newcastle, so hopefully that'll be fun..."

And I saw 'The Man Who cried' on video last night (Johnny Depp fan here) and nearly died at the hotness of him. *Puddle of drool* 
BTW, any ideas for a present, for a Buffyverse obsessed girl who has it all (Inclus=ding a necklace almost exactly like the one Angel gave buffy.) I tried to get a Claddagh (SP?) ring but they were all too small for her. Desperate here."

Noty much going on, loving the cold, wet weather. It's perfect for my long black coat. (I wore it in the summer, but i kept getting funny looks...)Ive just shown a friend the rape scene in Buffy season 6 and we both agree that they are both totally out of character, Spike is just....off...he's never forced her to do that before, i dont believe he would. Buffy is too weak, she could have hit him at any time and stopped the event before it got started, but she acted way too stereotypically girly. Okay, finished now. *toddles off to madhouse again*"

Okay. Today I had a long an' pointless debate with a friend about whether Angel or Spike was the best vampire. I won, evidently, after stating the obvious fact that at least Spike doesn't go all 'grr' after he's had sex. *evil grin* I'm amazed she didn't think of that before annoying me.

"event","i wish that school was over. i wish that some people weren't leaving this summer. i wish he would aknowledge my presence more often. i wish life was easier. i wish i wasn't as selfish. it's scary how people say highschool and college are the best years or our life. i mean of course i have fun...it's not as easy as I thought it would be."

"event","well i have been gone since friday morningish, in winterhaven. swim meet. it wasnt that great, swam like shit, felt worse. had a few million lectures on why I need to change my ""ways"" because im going to end up with no friends as i get older. so. im attempting to become nicer? because apprently everything i say or do is rude even if i dont intend for it to be. this week is going to be the worst yet for the following reasons.

1. English Informal Oral...Monday
2. Crucial Spanish Test...Tuesday
3. Creative Spanish Orals...Wednesday
4. 1500-1900 Research Paper...Next Monday

This english oral is gonna be tough, it is on the two most recent books we have read and you dont find out which book you get until right then. so if i get the one I dont understand to well, im screwed. pray for me. I think teachers have succeeded if their goal is for us to consume all our time outside of school with more school."

"event","i got a lj. wow. its been a long time. cool username huh? EnorrTheWhore. yesterday was one of my all time lows. was half asleep in most classes and had about 4 hours of homework to do. everything before 7 am this morning sucked. my mom tells me im selfish and disrespectful. and that i am too irresponsible to drive. so i have to wait yet another month. omg. stupid. she basically said I think im hot shit and I need to get over it if i want a license. whatever. after 7 am i was fine! didnt do much, had honor society induction, swam. now im here, packing my bags for a long weekend with the swim team in winterhaven. i want alex to come back again. she is good for me. helps me with stuff. i guess i will go back to avoiding my parents until they cool off about the driving issue."

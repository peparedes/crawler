"event","I hope that everyone's break is going spectacular! Mine hasn't neccesarily been that but is going ok too. Two of my sisters and their boyfriends are coming home for christmas, and my oldest sister's dad. We are going to have something like eleven people in our house for christmas. My dad had to buy a another double bed so people will have a place to sleep. I love christmas time, the giving, the taking. I have been kind of busy with shopping and wrapping. I baked a bunch of cookies with corey last night. I have been shopping a lot and also thinking about making an actual budget for myself.
I got to talk to my dear roommate and friend yesterday, and I must say, I love that girl and I don't care who knows it! It definitely made my week to talk to someone from home in bellingham. I can't wait to go back! It's weird because for a while when I had first moved, I couldn't wait to see my friends from spokane, and now I really can't wait to see my friends from school. I love you guys!"

"event","I am having a very good day. I walked to class in the pouring rain, and worked out. I had to walk across campus in the rain and sweating, but finding out that I got a 70 on my math quiz and full credit for the homework I turned in early so I could skip, was just what I needed to lift me up. Then, when I left for home, the rain had stopped and the sun was shining so bright I had to cover my eyes. I finished all of my homework and actually understand it too!! Yay! 

Oh, and for the second time in a row, Caitlin and I actually got all of our laundry done!! No, its seriously amazing, people get pretty vicious with the laundry room, and I almost had to throw down once! For real! Right there in front of the washer! Anyway, clean stuff is nice, and I am going to be relaxed the rest of the day!

My fish are doing well too. I am going to give one to my neighbor, Gwen. Linda doesn't really like ken anyway. Plus its more room for shanaynay to do her thang. 

Peace out!"

"event","I am very happy to be home, at least my home here in Bellingham. My roommate and I cleaned our room and we bought pretty blue rocks for our fish and so I gave them a little home decor, if you will. I am feeling very cozy, and relaxed after the long weekend. I also found out some very exciting news! My sister may be having a baby! I might just be an aunt! I can't believe it! I knew it would happen one day, but I didn't know it would be today! this is a big step for her and our whole family. I have three older sisters, ages 29, 27,20, and then theres me, 18. None of us are married or have children. Of course I don't want to be married this young, but my older sisters get a lot of pressure if they even have boyfriends, to get married, and when is it going to happen and lalala. So, I know my parents are going to be very surprised when they find out. All of us girls are pretty independent and so it is very surprising that one of us is settling down. I am happy for her. I am just so surprised!

Anyway, Caitlin put a picture of me so there I am! Its a funny picture of us both that she cropped my face out of, but I love it even though I have added a bit of jewelry to my face since then. Its a great first LJ picture! 

I still have homework to do, and monday is gonna be a bitch, but I am so glad that I got to spend the weekend out of Bellingham, and with someone totally awesome who I love!"

"event","First entry eh?

Well, I actually signed up for this account a long time ago, and now I am in Tacoma, and for some reason I get this urge to update. Actually, I am with my roommate and her friend angie, and I just learned how to update. 

So, Anyway,I am having a great weekend with my great roommate and her great friends. Ahh, everything is so great! No, but I do love my roommate, and I am glad that I got out of bellingham for a while. I did get fish on friday though, and I am a little worried about their well being right now, but I bought them some cool rocks to make up for the long lonely weekend. Shanaynay, the biggest one, gets a little bitchy when she is cooped up in the vase. Its a big vase! And she has simon to cuddle with. 

Well, I am here with my roommates family and friends and I it makes me want to see my own fam damily, and friends, and even though I don't technically have a room there, I want to see my house, with my garden that I spent so much time in and my dog, Otis, Shmotey! I really miss my family, and am concerned for my friends, but I seriously love it in B-ham, and can't wait to bring my roommate to my world in Spo-compton!

Its time to go, but its been swell, and I hope to write again soon!

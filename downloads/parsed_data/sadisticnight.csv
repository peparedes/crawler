THe longer i work there the more i dont like my boss JUDY. IT should really be spelled JOOODY, as in the biggest jooo ive ever met. AND she is way to critical. she was way out of line making a remark about piercings after meeting KElley my prom date. Shes a really kool and beautiful girl. I think the piercings look good. Judy is just to nieve to look past the piercings. CEST LA VIE. i dont know how to exactly spell that shit. i dont know, just an FYI to any one who reads this babbling. I trying to organize a lil suare at my house( thatmeans party) or rather a bonfire sometime after prom and before graduation.

"event","Its funny how shit always works out for a person. It seems that everything just doesnt go your way. Then everything miraculously changes for the better. It is like a series of ups and sowns, its really crazy. Shit is good lately, and this weekend iwas pretty tits. First off i put my glass in the air for Sir THomas MCguire, and his spectacular shindig. It was fucking great, BIll got pretty fucked, but other than that its all good. Mel came with, and had a blast, except for the whole mandy staring at here the whole time thing. Adam was right there wasdefinately a wall of tension readiating from mandy. She was so jealous of all of it. Granted shes my cousin and i was iffy but whatever its adam. Mandy definately still wants him. HIm mel are just friends, for now at least, you have no chance mandy give up....on sunday we had a bonfire and it was pretty cool. Dan fell on his ass cause the grass was slick, and adam bond rolled over the fire while holding a ciggarette. it was pretty damn funny. YEsterday was the shit day, and i mean shit as in bad. NOthing to do, just depressed as all hell for no reason. I think it was because mel wen tback tto ohio for awhile, meh its  kind of boring, lol, when shes not here. I also kind fo felt like i drove her away, cause i was extremely negative. I am trying to make it easy fo rher to adapt, and introduce her to some ok people, but i dont think im doing a good job....ohwell shell be back ain a few days, and hopefully her carreer can pick up for her...i really hope she makes it, cause she seems so intent and set on it.     SO i think anne hates me, its prolly impssible to even imagine anything betwwen me and her. SHe is so beautiful. I thinink yet again that adam is right ( one thing i would never want to admit two) that i set my sights to high, and i need to come down a lil bit. Lets face it im not the greatest looking guy in the world, so coming down with my sights should be good. Mr. BRown is all over my shoulder trying to catch me typing this shit, so im out, i need to update this sum a bitch more often. LAterz"

On another note, school is starting.......yippeee(not).....another year of hopeful outcomes destined to turn into failure....it blows....Ohwell. So i have been questioning myself lately. I wa ssitting at this hunk of shit computer wondering, why do i bitch about not having a gf but do dick about it. I like many girls, but i always bitch out and say nothing... for example i like kara still but for some reason i havent said shit, i think friendship is best but who knows until something is done...Theres also another who ive liked for a long time.... AnnE Hecht....I think i have liked her since like 8th grae or something like that, but always got intimidated by her .....again saying nothing.....Last but not last, i have yet to stop having feelingss for Tracy, i know friends is best, and i dont plan on changing anything, but it just makes me think why have i never said anything, i just sit back and stare, and wonder what it would be like....its time for i cahange i believe ....it would only make sense, this being the only thing i feel missing in my life....well see what happens, and ill try to keep this bitch updated

"event","OK.... does it seem right that a teenager gets in trouble, because he calls to inform his father that he is going out, gets the answering machine... leaves a message of where hes going... then gets ahold of his mom and tells her..and the father snaps cvause he didnt stop by the house and tell him personally of every step he takes.....Jesus fucking Christ......
 I could see them snappin if i didnt call at all, then showed up later that night and told them my plans.... but shit im not a fuckin child....im not trying to be disrespectful...but honestly.

Why cant i seem to attract any of the beautiful women at school...there are so many outstanding women at school....tracy, brenda, steph....its not my fault im so damn shy..you would think because im a big guy, that i wouldnt be so damn timid....i try, but i guess im just not the likable kind

Oh and her it goes..im throwin it down
The first person to seriously post on this telling me that im a lil bitch for whining and complaining...can go suxk my dick, after i beat the shit out of them....You asswipes dont know how it feels, to be without that feeling of being needed by somone and vice versa for over two god damn years....it sux to see everyone around you happy with a significant other, while your always a third wheel. Or how it feels to be turned down so many times, and have your heart ripped out chewed on and spit out half masticated for the world to see......It sux massive dick....the only one i know can relate is adam...so dont be cmin up in here and talking massive smack unless you can back it up..ive felt the pain..i can bitch if i god damn want to

Oh and a nother point, its not like i havent tried to find someone, its not fucking working. NO matter how hard i try, i become to close, or scare them off.

FUCK IT
FUCK THE PAIN
FUCK IT

I said that the whole hating adam and shit was getting annoying, cause frankly i dont see the gig fucking deal.....and yes mandy you can be extremely inconsidrate at times, its true... dont deny it... examples i hav plenty....When your driveng and you cut someone off and they honk there horn(cause ya know the are allowed to do that cause you cut them off) you flick them off like they are in the wrong.. thats inconsiderate.. or a t georges when you said that fat or ugly people did not deserve to have any pride, well about a year ago that applied to me, that hurts a lil, also alot of my friends are pretty damn ugly, and alot o fthe mare fat... and without pride they would have nothing.. so yes that is inconsiderate.... i dont hate either of you, but god damn take the criticism dont bitch about it...... fuck im out ofr now"

I havent put an entry in in a while...my bad. things are there, school is ok, not good, but ok. im lonely as helll.....oh i have some advice to everyone.. never go to new york with your family, its so god damn boring. All of the historical shit and whatnot. YEt it would be pretty tits to go with a group of friends, especcially to greenwhich village. It is totally an individualist community...punks, goths, artistics, musicians, personally i found it to be the coolest part. ground zero just pissed me off personally, i didnt want to see it.. and the statue of liberty was kind of yeah not intriguesg to me...the museums may have been, but not all that stuff....Alot of gothic churches, whaich were awesome, gargoles, the whole shabang..... YEah on the home fornt.....
im so uterly and totally lonely. I am still searching for someone to be with, share my secrets, and just hold close when the day sucked, but its not gonna happen...im so optimistic it makes me sick. got nothin much else to say except for...........IM RICK JAMES BIATCH!?!

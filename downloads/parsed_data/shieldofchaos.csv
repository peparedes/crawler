It also seems classes will be coming to a close somewhat soon, after yet even MORE festivals. How many blasted festivals can one have in such a short amount of time? First the masquerade then the gluttonous feasting festival involving the genocide of some strange looking birds. What in bloody hell is it now?

Regardless, I've noticed a great deal of people here discussing something called a ""Halloween Dance."" Had not so many people been talking about it, I don't think I would have cared enough to look into it.

Apparently ""Halloween"" was once called ""Hallows Eve,"" or the night of the dead. It is a large festival in which people dress and act as that which they fear; as monsters, demons, ghouls, ravenous beasts and the like. They place fake gashes upon their faces and limbs, soak themselves in artificial blood, and wield false weapons so as to pantomime the horrors which haunt them in the night.  

They avoid their fears but drowning themselves in it, placing themselves in that which causes them distress, pretending, if only for one day, that they are something which they are not and can never possibly become, dreaming of untold power and the ability to kill for enjoyment.

It's quite a charming concept. This is an event I will certainly make an effort to observe."

So sexual! 

In every city, there are dozens of these clubs where men can go. 
Some people need a little challenge to their fantasies at home. 
There's a little tiny number on a fold of matches, the ink drips from a little dancer's pen. 
Everybody wants that fold of matches to reinflate their confidence. 

Hey, it is a job. It pays a lot. Is it disservicing someone?

It's strangely similar to the creation myth of my planet; twin sons born, one of chaos and one of order. There are many differences in the story, of course, but I like this version as well, though I'm not fond of the ending.

The job here is alright, not exciting, but it's better than sitting in the dorm all day. I need to make a trip to the library soon to see what they offer in terms of research texts.

Warnings: Possible plot?

<lj-cut text=""Squick"">It was just below the sub level, under the supplies floor. The only way in and out was a single elevator, which inside was coded with a single touch pad. Nurses walked by, busy with folders in their hands, or minor conversations between one another. a thin, blonde, blue eyed doctor stood at the desk, a read out of various nano technology on the screen, he adjusted his mechanical glasses, seeing a 3d read out over his eye. he blinked, tired, rubbing his nose and sighing. he wrote down some notes in a folder, and handed them to one of the nurses conversing on the phone. ""File this in the bank, I can't be bothered..""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Elsewhere, Hilda met up with Yuber just outside of the diner.. ""I heard there's some GOOD blood up there!"" She pointed to the top floor of the hospital.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber looked up towards where Hilda had indicated with a smile. Hospitals worked. ""Well, let's not waste time. We're in a rush, no?"" With that he headed towards the automatic doors at the front of the building.</font>

The nurse, glanced to the doctor, then politely hung up her phone. She mouthed a ""fuck you"" right before she said ""Yes sir!"" and moved towards the elevator. She tapped a few buttons, and it opened with a vacuumed whisper. As soon as she had stepped in, it closed behind her. It descended.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">The vampiress had already begun stalking towards the doors without waiting for a response.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber wasn't far off from her. He entered through the doors alongside her and inspected the none-too-impressive staff. Nothing to be concerned with.</font>

The elevator made a polite dinging noise, and the door opened to darkness. Two large shapes stood on either side of an illuminated doorway on the other end of the hall. At the apex of each of the figures, two, very red ""orbs"" moved back and forth out of view. The nurse tightened her grip on the folder, reaching instinctivly for the name badge tucked away in her blouse. She held it out, and watched the back of the plastic card. 

She had worked with cybernetic patients before, however, these ""door greeters"" as the other nurses had called them, the gossip was abound about them, and what had happened to the blood bank in recent months. Their breathing was audible, almost in synch. The two orbs, once revealed in the tracked lights around the doorway, were in fact eyes, which ran in tracks all around their helmets. The breathing noises stopped, and one of them raised a hand, it formed a fist, one finger pointed outward. ""C'mon, you know the drill. Let me see your face.""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Pausing, Hilda took a soft sniff at the air, pointing to the elavators. ""This way. It's under us.""</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">""Ugh."" He never liked those blasted boxes on ropes. But he wasn't one to be picky. ""Fine..."" he nodded and walked over to the stupid contraption.</font>

""I, uh.."" She moved the card from her face, and the mounted eyes made a whining noise as they scanned over her. One slapped the door, and it slid open. 

The other guard, tilted it's head, the orbs going back to their scan pattern. A voice, very machine like spoke ""Why would you want to hide a face like that, sweetie?"" 

The nurse had already began to ignore their very prescense again. She approached the desk, nearest the wall. She laid the folder down, an older man sat behind the desk. He peered up from his book, and took the folder, opening it. 

He nodded in approval. ""Thank you, ma'am."" He offered a soft smile, no teeth behind his lips. A figure huddled in the corner, arms behind his back. Four small orbs contained on a metal band around his forehead, tiny wires leading into the back of his neck from the band, and his chest piece. He waved nicely as the woman left, fully aware of how all this must look to her. On the wall behind him, a small panel stuck out. The only other thing in this white room, besides the desk.
 
The nurse had approached the elevator, and pressed the button when she noticed it wasn't still docked on this floor. She suddenly felt even more tense.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">The two ignored the odd looks they received on their way to the elevator. Pushing the down button, Hilda leaned back on the wall. ""Got a plan for this?""</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">""What's there to plan?"" He shrugged as the doors closed and the elevator slowly dropped. ""We take what we need and shove anyone else out of the way.""</font>

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""We'll have to get down further. It smells deeper... Can you get one of those guys over there to tell us?"" Hilda pointed to a group of orderlies viewed from the opening doors.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">A smile. ""Certainly."" He walked up to the indicated group quickly. No need to waste time. ""You."" He stopped. ""Where is the blood bank? We're in a hurry.""</font>

""You don't want to go down there."" A puzzled look from the orderly.

<font color=""#0033FF"">""That's not the answer I wanted. I want to know where the blood bank is."" He clenched and unclenched one hand.</font>

""Look, guy.."" He peered from left to right, and leaned forward. Youthful expression crossed. ""I dunno what your deal is, but that's spook central right now... But, if you got the money, I got the time..""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Hilda had snuck up behind Yuber, smoothing out her sheer skirt while waiting for some answers.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">... He gave the guy a dubious look. The man had to be joking... ""Money? I'd say it would be more valueable for you to let us through. No harm will be done that way."" Which would be a complete shame...</font>

""I like you, guy, really. But you don't really know what you're getting into, do you?"" He motioned towards a small man, sitting on a chair, which became clear this chair was out of place. Small details of the man didn't match either. One eye color was opposite the other, and he had a small twitch in his right shoulder, which, down to the second, would tweek. 

The orderly looked forward, and whispered. ""C'mon, you wouldn't want to hurt me, right? I bet you're from G Corp. What you're looking for is here, but you won't get it alone..""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""Hey, I don't have the time for this!"" Pulling Yuber back behind her, she stood up to the orderly. ""This is an emergency! Let us through, ok?"" She cocked a hip out to rest an impatient hand on it.</font>

The orderly began to back away, taking his cart with him. ""You keep up like that, and you'll get us all in trouble..""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""But it iiiiiiiiissss!!""</font>

He quickly moved back to them, pretending to work on his cart, as if to give them something. ""Look, I don't talk unless I get something in return.""

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber's patience was growing thinner by the second. ""Remind me again why we have to go downstairs when there's plenty of blood right here."" This was accompanied by a sarcastically friendly smile.</font>

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""That's right!"" Grinning a fangy little smirk, Hilda's gaze went to a supply closet. ""Shall we?""</font>

""Not there... They can still see us there. If you're serious about this, follow me."" He shuffled his cart around a corner, and into an operating room.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">The girl waited for Yuber to go first.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF""><i>Finally...</i> Yuber followed the man, now looking bored and slightly disappointed.</font>

He leaned across his cart, pouring himself a glass of water. ""Want to hear the gossip?""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""You've got 2 minutes to tell me everything!""</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">He honestly couldn't care less, but he said nothing in opposition.</font>

""The spooks, and all of the specialists... Man, I can't believe I'm not more a part of this... but they told me the blood belongs to some sort of crossbreed? I dunno the details, but it's said to be almost immune to... everything. Meaning whoever gets it first, can start curing anything, really... I've gotten two calls from the G corp... I figured that's who you were..""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""No, I'm just hungry!""</font>

""...What?""

<font color=""#0033FF"">""...."" Yuber had to hide a laugh at that.</font>

""Who the hell are you people?""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""What what?"" She opened her mouth and pointed at her fangs.</font>

""....Ah, no way. Are those real?""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""Wanna find out?"" She smirked towards the poor man before her.</font>

""Ah... no! Not really. I'm just here to make money..."" He pushed his cart aside, revealing a broken panel in the wall. ""The rest is up to you..""

<font color=""#0033FF"">He smiled and tilted his hat up a little. She was blunt at least. Admirable. ""Good. Let's go.""</font>

A nervous sigh. ""Man, what I wouldn't get to see how this goes..""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Blowing a little kiss to the orderly, she headed after Yuber. ""If you're tricking us~ I know what you look liiiiiiike~~""</font>

He waved his hands infront of his face. ""No tricks! Like, I said, the rest is up to you!""

<font color=""#0033FF"">The demon smiled as he continued on to hopefully where the blood banks were. All in all this had been much less trouble than expected...</font>

<font color=""#CC33FF"">With a wink, she disappeared into the hole with Yuber.</font>

The hole lead down into an old set of stairs, a wooden wall at the end of it. The smell of blood in the air, of course.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Hilda's stomach rumbled as they got closer.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber licked his lips absently, quickening his pace. The nostalgic smell was making this worth the trouble of actually leaving to 'help' someone.</font>

There was some screaming behind them, followed by a dull thud. The light at the end of the stairs faded. The smell of blood got more intense, as both of them were soon covered in it. Something flew past them both, leaving a bloody trail. The same unknown 'something' hit the wooden wall infront of them with another thud...

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Squealing, the girl jumped closer to the demon.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber stared after it. <i>What the-</i> ....Somehow the vampiress's closness was more unsettling than the sudden appearance of... whatever that was He clicked his sword from his sleeve as he tried to peer through the darkness. ""What in bloody hell...?""</font>

Revealed in Hilda's eyes was the scene of the orderly, his chest going in different directions, and his corpse flung wildly at both of them. Both pieces of him settled at other ends of the wooden wall.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""Someone got him before me!"" Angered, she stomped foward to see what had nailed him.</font>

A lanky form stood at the top of the stairs, the face of the man from the chair hanging to the side of the figure. ""Oh my, that's a nasty thing you've done to that man..!""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""Ewwww! What are you?""</font>

The face crumpled into a fine dust with a flash, the figure's long arms snaked behind his back. ""I'm the door greeter, of course. Who're you?"" Sounds from the other side of the wooden door, distinctive clicking noises.

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber looked up at the man with a frown. ""Visitors. Now get out of our way.""</font>

Two shining blades removed from behind his back, long, almost spider like fingers curling around the hilts. The figure bowed it's head, and the shoulder twitched as it had in the hallway. ""Are you.. serious?""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Hilda's stomach rumbled again in response.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">The demon's frown deepened and he changed his grip on his sword. ""Of course. Now move.""</font>

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""Only if you get out of our way so we can get the goods!""</font>

""I'll give you a chance. You put that sword in the girl, then yourself."" He snickered, his voice pitching when his shoulder twitched. ""Deal?""

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber stared at him before smiling. ""You must be joking. I think I'd rather your blood be spilt upon the floor to join theirs.""</font>

<font color=""#CC33FF"">She stood back, watching the two to see what they'd do.</font>

He whistled, once. Submachine gun fire pelted through the wooden door, bullets razing hot, some tracer rounds a fire red in the darkness. A mass of soldiers stood inside of what had once been a door, their weapons still blazing.

<font color=""#0033FF"">WHAT IN- Yuber jumped back a good foot or so, trying to not get caught up in the fire. What the hell was going on around here?!</font>

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Hilda poofed to her bat form, darting up towards the ceiling to stay out of the way.</font>

Each of the soldiers looked like a carbon copy of the other, all of their red orbs operating in unison. The first set of soldiers had emptied their rounds, and pulled back the charging handles in unison. The lanky figure at the top of the stairs whistled a second time, and each soldier slung their weapons, and ran forward towards the male in the hallway.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">She stayed up towards the top, watching the men, taking in the area and attempting to gather in places to dart to.</font>

""C'mon here, little one.. "" He pointed one of the blades towards the bat. ""I've got something for you.""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""What?? I don't like to be shishkabob again!""</font>

""If I pull your skin off as a bat, will it carry over?"" He twitched, and laughed, cybernetic voice echoing.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Dropping down ever so slightly, Hilda attempted to zip in through the open door.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber glared at the small army heading his way. This was absolutely ridiculous... And where in blazes had that vampire gotten to?! Argh! Nevermind... He slammed the hilt of his sword into one of the charging soldiers. With the demon ward, there was only so much he could really do. But if anything, fighting with Tira had at least taught him a few loopholes... He moved back and quickly whispered the small spell under his breath, until two other copies of himself split apart. The copies weren't limited as he was. Much better~</font>

The first soldier met his hilt, and buckled forward in a wide arc, his legs catching two other soldiers. he thudded against the floor, spilling over on his shoulders, sparks from the impact and following slide. the two behind him fell, and impacted in the brick wall. A figured covered in a tarp, on an operating table laid in the middle of the room. Many tubes going in and out of the tarp, an almost 'fire red' blood color flowing in the tubes.

<font color=""#0033FF"">The copies performed the more fatal (read fun/enjoyable) part; slicing through some of the slower soldiers and gutting them. Yuber himself resorted to bashing the more intricate opponents over the head with minimal resistence from the ward. Yuber distractedly looked at the mess... Something wasn't right here. This scent was odd... not normal.</font>

Soldiers began to fall left and right, the occasional failure from the circulation pumps, and the mixture of blood and synthetic lubricants began to form a puddle at the feet of the copies. some of them, even with their guts cut clear through, still twitched and rolled around. some of their pain audible, some of them absolutely silent. He twitched at the top of the stairs, and slammed the opposing hilts of his blades together. A *clicking* noise could be heard, as the blades connected, and locked together.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">The pink bat attempted to speed up, darting around to stay as a moving target.</font>

The lanky figure's blades spun wildly, he raised the spinning blades above his head. ""One sweep!"" Laughter from the hallway. He arced back, and threw the spinning blades down the hallway. they made a terrible screaming noise as they cut through the air, and occasionaly cut into the wall, sending sparks.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Dropping down again, the terrible noise hurt her ears to the point of needing to turn back into her slim form. She landed near Yuber.</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber stared in amazement at the sight. He'd never seen a weapon used in such a way before... He stayed staring a bit too long and only thought to, maybe, move out of the way a second or so too late. He jumped back, the spinning blades slicing at his arm as he did so.</font>

The blade flung into the room past them, just before it hit the operating table, a figure stepped forward, catching it with little effort. ""Why all this fighting?"" The four red orbs on the headband glanced over the scene, two very human eyes looking towards the chaos as well. ""This isn't some stupid game, where you just play with people's lives. ""

<font color=""#0033FF"">He turned to the now reemerging vampiress before turning to the new figure in the room. <i>Grand. Another one...</i></font>

""What the hell happened here?"" The blades disconnected, and fell to the ground before the lithe figure. Arms crossing, he let out a soft sigh.

The lanky figure at the stairs scowled, and screamed. ""These two attacked someone here.. and tried to recover the sample..""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""LIAR!!"" She pointed accusingly at the figure. ""I just want something to eat!""</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber glanced between the two with an exasperatted expression. ""She's correct. You were the one who attacked first... Not that it makes much difference.""</font>

He glanced to his black nails, picking a bit of the blade out of them. Once held up against his glowing eyes, it was clear catching the blade had split his entire hand wide, towards the wrist. Small nano machines moved forward over age old exposed bone, dragging with them a thin wire like fabric, repairing the small motors burried in the skin and muscle. ""Food? You guys some sort of ghouls?"" His voice sounded bothered, almost annoyed.

""We.. attacked first? How so? You're here, you attempted to infiltrate this place.""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Hilda took a step towards the man. ""I'm a vampire and was told there's some extra yummy blood here. I've just been through a lot and need some nourishment!""</font>

<font color=""#0033FF""><i>.................Yummy?</i> Yuber scratched his head and placed away his sword.</font>

""Stay where you are. Are you a ghoul?""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""No! I just told you! I'm a vampire!""</font>

<font color=""#0033FF"">""Neither of us are ghouls,"" he said, annoyed.</font>

The lanky figure descended the stairs, long arms tracing across the wall. The figure knelt, and rummaged over some of the fallen troopers. He retrieved two of their weapons, and began to check the ammo count.

The lithe figure sighed, blue lips snarling almost. ""I got that part, either one of you born full vampires?""

Another set of soldiers spilled through a door on the opposite side of the room, this time carrying rifles. The took firing positions, kneeling behind whatever.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">.oO""...Silver? Oh no..""Oo. It was times like this where she wished she had the invisible ability like her brother. ""M-maybe?"" She squeaked out.</font>

The lithe figure went suddenly still, standing at attention. As did the lanky figure behind them. ""No sir.... Yes, sir!... Yes, sir..."" They spoke in unison. 

<font color=""#0033FF"">.....This wasn't looking good at all. He looked between the drawn weapons and men and took a single step closer to Hilda. ""....""</font>

Eventually the lanky figure turned towards the body on the table. Two small, individual bags were recovered. A bag thrown at either of their feet. Synringes thrown to them, as well. ""Here's the deal, you give us a single pint.. no, a drop of blood. You have my promise, you can each carry two pints of this... 'blood' out of here, deal?"" His tone was calm again.

The lanky figure kept both submachines at the low ready, long ape like arms hanging nearly to his feet. Six yellow orbs running around the surface of his helmet, a tube extending from a patch of fabric over the mouth, what remained of the chin was only a dull, rounded surface with embedded steel, some of it connecting to the helmet.

<font color=""#0033FF""><i>A drop of our blood for two pints of this?</i> It was an odd exchange... But the options weren't quite for them, and Yuber had yet to test out his teleportation with the active ward. It was risky. ...What was the worst that could be done with a few drops of blood?</font>

""A pure desire of science...""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""We don't have a choice anymore, do we?"" Stooping down, she took out the syringe, sniffing at it to make sure it wasn't tainted. ""No funny things with this is there?""</font>

""Not muddled by any human hand, I promise.""

The lanky figure escaped off into the hallway the soldiers had come, casting aside the weapons like they were toys.

<font color=""#0033FF"">He snorted. Is there anything NOT muddled by hunman hand? Well, what did he care anyway? ""Hmph. Fine."" ... He stared at the syringe in confusion. He pulled off a glove, unhinged the needle, and used it to slice his palm. The blood dripped into the small container of the syringe. <i>....Pointless...</i></font>

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Taking one of her nails, she cut across her arm, instead filling the syringe up from the top. She never had a problem with gore and blood, but needles squicked her out...</font>

He moved to the control panel, and tapped a few things into the panel. the body under the tarp twitched and cried out. Two sacks began to expand under the operating table, the lithe figure knelt, his back to them. His neck was a pale color, which lead to his exposed spine, small, almost obtuse wires snaked across it into the armor pressed around the skin. he snatched the two sacks up, his fingers curling around them testing their weight, his long black nails etching the words ""Free to good home"" into the thick plastic containing the fire red blood. he stood, gracefully bending over backwards, each palm containing one sack, arms pointed at either of them. his neck craned, and the orbs in his headband peered at both of them, his human eyes closed.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">The flesh around the wound closed up as she took her bag, exchanging the syringe.</font>

""Thank you miss.. and you, sir?"" Hand closed on the syringe, placing it safely in a pocket on his thigh.

<font color=""#0033FF"">He sighed and handed the syringe over to the man, taking his little sack of blood in exchange. This hardly seemed worth it.</font>

He erected back upwards, gracefully placing the syringe in his other pocket. ""Thank you so much.""

<font color=""#CC33FF"">""Can I punch your monkey up there please?"" She frowned.</font>

""Now get out before I kill you both..."" He wouldn't face them. The soldiers all clicked their selector switch from safe to semi, small tracking lasers all meeting on their hearts.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Grasping eagerly at her bag, the girl started for the exit.</font>

""Oh, do come back if there's any.. changes."" His voice pleasant again.

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber frowned and made a mental note to return as soon as the ward had been removed. He scoffed... <i>Blasted idiots...</i> He followed Hilda up the stairs, still looking back at the odd 'acquaintances' they'd just made.</font>

A large metal block was placed at the end of the stairs. Soldiers waited with rifles in the operating room, the orderlies cart used as a shield for two of them, peering over it.

The operating room door was held open, soldiers in the now empty hallway, all with rifles pointed.

<font color=""#CC33FF"">Hilda licked her fangs widely, making a show of how she wouldn't hesitate to drain anyone in her way.</font>

The lanky figure stood at the set of double automatic doors, nurses huddled at the other end of the hall nearest the exit. He waved a hand for the doors to open. Gorrila like arms eventually crossing, head turned to the side.

<font color=""#0033FF"">Yuber, on the other hand, just looked pissed. This hadn't gone at all how he'd hoped. He sent a look to their little audience as they made their way towards the exit.</font>

---

<font color=""#669933"">""Mm, is this the collected reports?"" The figure sat in a massive leather chair, infront of him a glass desk suspended on silver bars. his legs crossed, his body reclined. A woman placed the collected photos, video stills, and a tape recorded on his desk. 

The first report explained the blood type and its possibilities. The carrier was a woman, who at the time had just experienced some sort of mutation, giving her immortality. She had tested this theory many times with suicide, and many brave acts saving numerous lives. One such act had left her skull caved in, at the time, the ambulance had brought her in, finding a heartbeat. She had recovered, and under the influence of money and power, the operating doctor had brought in the specialists... Backed by the corporation. The numerous operations, and tests done in what had been the blood bank of the hospital had just ended the night of the 'raid.' 

The report ends, with a couple of stills, and short notes on how they kept her sedated until they figured out the immortality is in the blood. The cybernetic soldiers dispatched had all been test subjects of this blood, and had gone pretty much docile, most of their human minds replaced with a simple fighting program. 

The next report is from the security administrator, the lithe figure. His report is centered around the lanky figure's report, and explains key details ignored in the report. with a great attention to detail, he began to explain the effects of the blood on the soldiers. Only a few of them had survived mentally the effects of imposed immortality seemed to just burn out the brain, and leave the body forever motionless.

The report picks up, explaining the attack and the raid. The words, now written in ink explain the time the call was recieved, and the orders translated to the commanding soldiers. This report ends with ""Must track the subjects?""

The final report was a set of genetic codes, printed out, parts of them highlighted. ""First genetic docks established. Clones started out at 40%...""

Written in ink, again. ""Can science control even a reflection of a monster?""

Two pictures, adolescent versions of the two who had attacked the raid lay motionless, matching bullet wounds in their foreheads. ""First copies became useless. Second copies the same. The fourteenth or so pair are up for termination, however...""</font></lj-cut>"

currently drinking an avery samael's oak-aged barley wine and enjoying it immensely.  was one of my faves at hard liver and was a good purchase later on at bottleworks.  the 15% is really getting on top of me, however.  those colorodan bastards hid the alcohol a little too well."

"event","i was listening to kexp the other day at work and a song came on that sent me rushing for my computer.  i looked at the online playlist because the song sounded so much like portishead, i had to know who it was.  lo and behold, it was portishead, though a song i had never heard or heard of before.  the dj then came back on announcing that the song was from portishead's NEW ALBUM RELEASED AT THE END OF NEXT MONTH!!!!  squeee!  after ten years, i had, of course, given them up for dead.  o, ye of little faith.  i was thrown into such a high state of excitement, my nipples became erect.  seriously.  SERIOUSLY!  fucking yes.

i, uh, just felt the need to share that.

"event","""reveal"" lightbulbs reveal far too much.  as a fan of bar lighting, i was upset to turn on the bathroom lights just a moment ago and find myself bathed in the cleansing light of salvation.  m&k bought me some lightbulbs for my bathroom and installed them without my knowledge.  jesus.  wow.  after my dim little cave it was a bit too much.  still, it's appreciated.  i've forgotten this little errand at least once now.  it needed doing.

my father, after a long delay, had his heart surgery a week ago and is at the beginning stages of his recovery, which, so far, has been a bit tumultuous.  he's been in the icu at harrison for a week now but seems to be coming through pretty well.  the bottom portion of his lungs refused to pop back into shape as they're supposed to so his blood oxygen levels weren't coming up to what they're supposed to be at.  apparently they drained some fluid from around his lungs yesterday and since then he's been walking around a bit.  good signs.  i've got the number for the direct line to his room but, after seeing him on sunday, i'm hesistant to call.  he was so drugged up he was barely what one could describe as conscious.  in addition to that, he had some sort of mask or another on 90% of the time i was there.  makes communication kinda difficult.  on top of that, neither one of us are telephone types.  i guess i'll just wait until this weekend when i can see him in person.  he should be in much better shape then.  i really hope when he comes out of this he has no recall for his time in the icu.  he seemed miserable.  as one would imagine.  plus i don't think i've ever seen him seeming so small and fragile and vulnerable.  i've more thought on that subject which i don't think i'm even going to attempt to put into words.  they have to remain as feelings and memories and intuitions.  the only happy thought in all of this is that he's going to feel like a new man when he's fully recovered.

aside from that big brew-up, nothing much is going on.  couple weeks back i went with potter and peterburs to the baron brewery tap room down yonder in southpark.  total scarytown.  the taproom was located in an industrial park where crime seemed to be lurking in the shadows like cockroaches.  if you turn the lights on, it scuttles under the fridge, but once the lights go out, they have a dance party.  the taproom itself was about the size of my room and looked like a bar that somebody would set up in their basement.  very bland, very small, but, it being baron and me being a huge whore for baron brewery, the beer was fucking fantastic.  i filled my big growler with the ueberweizen (a dunkles weizenbock) because it was so fucking amazing.  tastes like banana juice, goes down like water, kicks like a mule (8% abv).  fucking god.  two liters for twenty-something dollars american?  yes, please.
we then went to the local casino (rascal's) for dinner.  the service was terrible, the food was passable, but the companionship was beyond reproach so a good time was had.  we then retired to the home of CXP where further malt beverage consumption took place.  i got home around seven in the morning.  being on the street of the UD at that time was refreshing.  the streets were empty.  no noise, no rabble.  nice.  however i was too drunk and tired to really bask in it.
this last weekend m. sleipness purchased rockband so i played that for about six hours.  total fucking hoot.  multiplayer guitar hero with a karaoke aspect?  absatively.  sign me up post haste.  i want to be playing it all the time with good friends.  and, let us not forget, good beer."

"event","everybody looks better in scrubs.  maybe not better, but at least like they look like they belong.  you put on the scrubs, suddenly you're on the team.  only the badge gives your station away.  fuck.  have i mentioned this?  so one of the biggest problems i have with the hospital environment is the ""brave new world"" atmosphere.  i'm a gamma minus.  at least, according to my badge i am.  all ID badges have a color-coded stripe running down the side.  green is a low as it gets.  my stripe is green.  so are those of janitors and food deliverators (i know that's not a real word.  neal stephenson says it is.  so fuck off.).  i've got this connexion in my head with the word ""green"" and ""gamma"".  most likely this is due to the connection i have drawn between my place of work and the work of fiction, ""brave new world"".  the place...well, it's just creepy.  i've been there so long at this point, it's not as bad as it was, but sometime i'll remember how creepy i used to think it was, then it's creepy all over again.  but not as it was when it was through fresh eyes.  can't unring a bell.  there's this guy in the paging office, does the PA calls a few days a week, he really reinforces my argument about the place.  he has the most sonorous, relaxing, calm voice in the world.  like a 1930's radio commercial for gilette razors of lucky strike cigarettes.  i'll have to demonstrate in real life to get the point across, but he's always announcing code 199s (heart attacks/crash situations) or code reds (fires) in a voice that says ""nothing is wrong, go about your business.  this is normal, everything is fine.  what you need, friend, is another dose of soma.""  i would really like for him, one night, to come on and say ""attention all staff:  there has been a cataclysmic radiation leak.  attention:  there has been a cataclysmic radiation leak.  we are all doomed.  please, remain calm.  we are all doomed.  repeat, doomed.  have a nice day.""  that would make me happy.
but what was i saying about scrubs?  oh, yes.  mean old codger of an OR nurse got pissed at me tonight.  tall, lean, bone of a man.  looks like somebody whittled him out of a piece of wood not fit for kindling.  hearing aids in both ears, vegetable brush mustache, square glasses, white shock of hair, usually hiding under a surgical cap, a mouth that's in a perpetual state of near frown, looks like it would only be happy with a big chunk of chaw stuck in it.  he was mad because i put together a stat case and they added on a second PL to the case and i put both sets of supplies in the same cart.  both sets of case supplies were seperated out.  in the cart.  just a little work.  but he seems like the hard-bitten type of man who would get thrown off his feed over something like that.  wish i had been there to see his reaction.  ah, but the bit about scrubs.  in scrubs, he looks kind of intimidating.  not a man to be crossed.  like a lifelong batchelor, who, through some sort of backroom agreement ended up marrying your mother.  you don't know much about him, except to fear him.  one night, i saw him in the OR locker room, on his way out.  he was dressed like a hunter:  khaki duck cotton pants, a flannel shirt, a black and red checked jacket, some species of hat with wooly bits here and there.  the only thing missing was the break-open double barrel shotgun in the crook of his arm, the pipe in his mouth, and the loyal sad-eyed dog at his knee.  he looked like a man out of his element.  all he did was change out of hospital PJs and into his ""normal"" clothes which made him look like he stepped out of a norman rockwell saturday evening post cover.  the clothes make the man?  do they?  do they unmake him as well?  i don't know.  i had somebody ask me if i was a surgeon the other night.  i did my best to not laugh in his face.  surgeons don't ride the bus."

"event","i'm drunk and sleepy, so i'm going to keep this short, but i just finished watching the entire series of 'firefly'.  i liked it quite a lot, and, as goes with so many things i like a lot, they're finite.  they end.  no more, nada, no longer amongst the living.  they have an end that is clearly in sight.  bummer, that.  man, that's more of a bring-down than i was looking for.
ANYWAY, my point.  i love the show.  good, pretty much all the way around.  HOWEVER! the character of river is possibly the most easily-hateable character i think i've ever encountered.  the whole super-human-yet-schizo-special/endearing routine got so old, so fast, i started to empathise with jayne (the character that one is supposed to find MOST unloveable) simply because he voices my exact opinion on said character.  i mean, i hate the character so much, i hope that the actress who portrays her never gets work ever again.  she's like the sci-fi equivalent of a smart-mouthed child on a sitcom.  fuck.  every time she was on screen i just cringed in anticipation of the bullshit that a.) she was going to say and b.) the bullshit she was going to stir up with her ""my brain is special"" antics.  so i ended up in the camp of jayne, the man who loves guns and hates smarts.  i guess this is all part of the genius of the show, however, as there's a character that everybody can love, even if it's for the wrong reasons.
wowee.  and that's the most talking about a (now-defunct) television program that i've ever done, and hope to do, for quite some time."

"event","so...the party.  fantastisch.  haven't had so much fun in a long time.  presence of randos and far too much man meat may have marred things a bit, but most of my favorite people were there and much merriment was had, so everything was on the up and up.  things are blurry.  i wrestled many a person.  fortunately, i paid a heavy price for it:  my left arm is pretty badly out of whack, both hips are bruised, there a crink in my neck, and there's random pains here and there.  i overindulged.  however, i think everybody did.  huzzah!  one hosts bowed out early, but MB tied herself to the binnacle and stayed the course.  huzzah!  she mayhap felt the worse for wear the next day, but, again, my hat collection is tipped to this fine example of womandom, may her name be forever prais'd.
on to serious business.  so, i've been spinning my wheels for a little over a year now.  i need to get out of the spinning wheel business.  i need a change of tack.  i don't know what, but i need to do something.  first off, i need to get back into more creative business.  i remember a time when i used to paint every now and again, draw all the time, and write compulsively.  i've haven't done much of any of that any time recently.  what gives?  i'm seriously disappointed in myself, to say the least.  now that i'm done with college and earning a semi-reasonable amount of money, my parents have stopped with the disapproval and guilt jags and so i'm left to kick myself into action, which isn't really working.  i'm not much of a self-motivator.  i mean, sometimes, yeah, but not very often.  the whole exercise gig has been start and stop from the get go.  more stop than start, obviously, but this is just to serve as an example.  jesus, i've been wasting time!  valuable lifetime sands are slipping away!  thirty is rushing at me like a tide of wal-mart holiday sale shoppers and i'm doing nothing to make my mark, be accomplished, happy, or otherwise make a contribution to this one spark of a life time.  i'm letting it whizz on past by grinding out a paycheck and then blowing it away on self-medication and shoes.  FUCK!  FUCK!  FUCK!  what am i to do?  i get more creative as far as the writing kick goes once a bit of the old sweet and mellow slips down the windpipe, but it does nothing to inspire other variations on the theme.  perhaps that's where i'm meant to be.  perhaps, just maybe, the writer's craft is beckoning.  i just need to whittle myself into a scalpel of precision prose and get to work.  maybe i need a kick in the ass from somewheres.  one would think a dead end job and no prospects would suffice, but i guess it's not enough.  i need to make myself more unhappy.  there, found it!  how can i become more miserable with my lot and be COMPELLED to dig myself out through my own latent talents?  think...think.  oh bugger, i hate awkwardness and drama, so that'll never work.  perhaps taking advantage of those free UW credits and taking some mid level ingrish class will force me to write something that isn't here or in a notepad.  perhaps.  perhaps.  or maybe i'll just continue down this semi-bland road for a bit longer.  NO!  resist.  find an answer.  shame i only do my best thinking in the shower or after a few ounces.  well, a shower is out of the question at this hour.  time for a ponder, methinks."

"event","i can't stand my job anymore.  therefore i'm calling all cows to help me secure a new one, hopefully within one month.  i'm going to do some trawling myself but, alas, it really is WHO you know.  i've already - as of tonight - put out feelers with CXP to see if i could land a bartending job.  i'm hopeful in this direction.  it's nothing grand, but it sure as shit beats the bullshitery going on at the ol' butcher shop.  i hate the union.  i hate the uppity-ups.  i hate the brave-new-world fucking THX-1138 atmosphere in that fucking place.  i really like wearing scrubs all the time, however.  it's like wearing pyjamas all the time.  
but really, it's just growing more intolerable by the day.  so i must quit it, post haste, lest i snap and just start screaming until i vomit banshees.
weekend rotation?  every six weeks?  oh, wait, i mean four weeks.  and i might have to randomly go to sandpoint and drive a truck.  and a lot of janitors make more than me (no slight to them intended, they work pretty damn hard, but i like to think my skills/knowledge is a bit more specialized).  and i get treated like a gamma-minus sub-moron except for when somebody throws me a curveball assignment and i don't pick up on it lickety-split?  plus increasing amounts of hardship and work for the same weary dollar amount?  no thanks, pal.  shove it up your urethra.
so...any leads?  or shall i continue to drink myself through this for the next couple years and ride the wave of semi-so-so benefits and attempt to drag my GPA up so i can eventually go to grad school and maybe in six or eight years get to where i REALLY want to be?  i don't know anymore!  i don't know!  
thank god there's nice, shiny people that i LIKE that i get to see on the weekend.  well, three weekends a month."

"event","fucking yes, and no, and how's your father?
geezus, i'm hating work right now.  it's doesn't help that i've put my resume in with amazon so now i'm on the apocalypse kick.  it feels like i've already put in my two weeks, even though nothing is certain.  except that i hate work.  i hate it.  i really do.  i'm underpayed.  and my boss still doesn't trust me.  ""did you just go smoke?"" she asked me at 2230 tonight.  uh, no, i'm too busy pushing heavy shit around at a high rate of speed.  fucking hell.  she checked up on me out at pavillion the night before.  i mean, she was there under the pretext of helping me, but i think she was actually looking to see if i was working.  i mean, i do the same shit every night.  EVERY NIGHT.  for the last year.  and one time she comes to help me?  something is rotten in denmark.  christ, ibeen there a year and she STILL thinks i'm fucking about.  get off my shit!  if i was fucking about, you wouldn't even find me.  sorry.
gah, enough of that now.  just.  needs.  to.  come.  out.  grrr.
my drinking habits have taken on an air of desperation lately.  weekend nights, especially.  the tail-ends of most saturday-sunday nights usually come off as a bit of a mystery recently.  what happened.  how did i get home.  why is my hand shredded to ribbons.  did i really spend that much?  oof, my head.
i think i try to pack in too much.  i should try to pare things down a bit, but there's so much to do, so many people to see.  i mean, they're all people that i REALLY want to spend time with, because from monday morning until friday night i'm on on the lindbergh kick.  single-o, that is.  just me and knifey and mr. coffee and ms. cigarette and commodore booze.  so weekend = explosive festival of happy special lucky goodtime.  too bad it ends up a patchwork quilt of memory.  ahh, well.  i'm assuming there's good times in the memory gaps.  i just hope i'm not leaving a bad impression anywhere.  please?
on dorkier notes, i ordered oblivion GOTY edition.  unfortunately, ebgames.com didn't tell me who their fucking shipper was until AFTER the fact - UPS.  fuck me rotten.  means i probably won't get it.  bastards.  i even sprung for the special deluxe super speedy deliverator-a-tron at an extra double fin in cost.  fuck fuck and double fuck.
lessee, is there anything else to report?  nope.  new job hopefully in the wings, living for the weekends, drinking hard.
OH!  i'm trying to get myself back into jogging.  i'm training the mind and body this week and next by jogging in place for 15-20 minutes before getting out on the mean streets.  even the forty-seven year-old, pregnant, bad-tickered patient who has a weird, makes-me-really-uncomfortable crush on me said today ""my! you're getting plump!""  fuck off, sister.  i don't need any help in the beating up on myself department."

"event","i've barely been reading.  i've been reading the same book for the last two months already.  mostly because i only read at work, and i always get interrupted by some fucker or another who wants to spill their word-hoard in my general direction, relating some fucking tale of woe or another.  i don't have the weight of the world on my shoulders, but i'm carrying quite the sack of stones.  i like listening to my friends' problems, but those of random strangers or vague acquaintances is another matter completely.  i don't care if you are dying.  shut up.  and no, you cannot have a cigarette.
but i'm digressing in a big way.  i got a lot of reading done this weekend thanks to a parental visit.  a lot of traveling, a lot of laying about.  end result, i read one of the best things ever.  it's a speech a napoleonic general gave to his men.  it had me laughing out loud:
""On 2 November Marshal Lefebvre harangued the Old Guard on the subject with usual directness.  'Grenadiers and Chasseurs, the cossacks are there, there, there, and there,' he said, gesturing to the four points of the compass.  'if you do not follow me, you are fucked.  I am no ordinary general, and it is with good reason that in the army of the Moselle I was known as the Eternal Father.  Grenadiers and Chasseurs, I say to you again:  if you do not stay with me you are fucked.  And anyway, I don't care a fuck.  You can all go and fuck yourselves.""
talk about inspiring.  
the balance of sunday was spent in good company drinking beers of extraordinary magnitude.  a fantastic night, if perhaps a little overdone.  i've had the feeling all day that my head is full of lutefisk.  good thing my boss doesn't expect much out of me on mondays.
i also may have a change of jobs in my near future.  opportunities are a-poppin'.
there's a bottle of samichlaus that's been ageing away in my fridge that's calling my name, but, with the lutefisk rolling around in my head, i don't think it's in the cards.  i'd like to get a couple of bottles from this year and lay them down for a few years, but i think i lack the willpower.  we'll see.  i'll feel good if this bottle makes it to jesus's birthday."

"event","i haven't written in here for a while.  not anything worthwhile, anyway.  i guess because there's nothing worthwhile going on in this ol' life o'mine.  there's work...and...well, that's about it.  and i could bore everybody and their brother cletus about that, but i'll refrain.  every now and again, i'll start talking to somebody or another about what's going on at work and i can almost hear their eyes glaze over.  so i stop before i go too far.
weekends equal life.  i never wanted to be one of those people.  you know, the kind that come in and say, ""hey, it's almost friday!""  ""three more days until friday!""  ""it's friday eve!""  ""nine more days until friday after friday!""
fuck.  i've also started saying ""beer o'clock"" WAY more than i want to.  just shoot me in the head.  i've always hated that shit, but here i am.
is this adulthood?  christ, i hope not.
but, those weekends are usually quite good.  i always spend time with people i ACTUALLY want to spend time with.  that's about six different people.  but it's enough.  that's all i want, that's all i get.  if only there were MORE of it.
i haven't been writing, i haven't been reading, either.  no stimulation outside of liquid and the digital.  tired, old computer games and alcoholic beverages and the glory of teh internet.  more three minute clips of hilarity and political viewpoints i disagree with, please.  thank you, oh internet.
the only creative pursuit is the beer one.  three batches in, what, six months?  this last one is good, perhaps a bit too delicate for my tar-slicked tastebuds, but quite nice, if a bit off for the style.  it's a wheat beer and boy howdy is it wheaty.  however, the addition of warrior hops (at 10-12% AAU) are a bit over the top.  they tend to dominate.  not really in a negative way, but it's a bit out of character for the style.  it's also rather undercarbonated, despite my use of almost a cup of corn sugar for priming.  i don't know what happened there.  perhaps the yeast wasn't as active as i thought.  anyway, a passable wheat ale - not a hefeweizen, not a wit, just a wheat ale.
guh.  i'm glad tomorrow is friday."

i just found out, though he's been dead nearly a month.  his guardian obituary can be found here:
http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/food/story/0,,2161923,00.html

""No one goes into a restaurant and requests 'a plate of food, please'. People do not simply ask for 'a glass of wine', without specifying, at the very least, whether they fancy red or white, dry or sweet, perhaps sparkling or still ... when their mood switches from the grape to the grain, these same discerning people folk often ask simply for 'a beer', or perhaps name a brand, without thinking of its suitability for the mood or the moment ... beer is by far the more extensively consumed, but less adequately honoured. In a small way, I want to help put right that injustice.""

michael, i raise my glass to you!"

He is well suited to do this because he strives to create harmony and peace in the midst of a crisis. The Hierophant's only problem is that he can be stubborn and hidebound.

i walked the ave last night, back and forth, looking - desperately - for a friendly face.  no more, no more.  that's the problem with these fuckin college towns:  the faces are constantly changing.  everybody i used to know has moved on, even if it's just to cap hill or northgate, it's far enough to keep me at home.
it's just plain hard to come back and get back into ""seattle mode"" after being in ""hostle mode"" for so long, where every night you're making a new friend, everybody wants to talk, you make eye contact and that person comes over, buys you a drink, and you talk for the next four hours.  nothing doing here.  no friend, it ain't happening.
i've applied for a bunch of jobs i'm not anywhere near qualified for.  but at least i'm trying.
i don't know what else to say for now.  it's great to be back?  it's not, but it'll do for now.  at least most people here speak english."

"event","while washing dishes, i came to grips with my fascination with alcohol consumption.
and now, while eating soy nuts, i will outline this revelation.
alcohol allows me to soar to normally unattainable heights.  alcohol brings the curtain down, lifts the shield, strips the shellack.  having an ounce or two in my system ""lets"" me say what's on my mind, do that which i already wish to do, and, for some reason, makes me funnier.  all the sorta-witty things that i think of normally, but don't say out of fear that they won't get a laugh or something, come out.  i'm more likely to make connections in my brain that lead to:  
a. witty/funny/entertaining  
b. insightful/meaningful  
c. good observation/awareness
i'm also more likely to take actions that i normally hold myself back from out of basic fear and discomfort with myself or the situation.
and i think it does the same thing for a lot of other people.
with a lot of psychiatry, i could probably learn to become this person on an all-the-time basis, but i don't have the type of shinplaster required for such an undertaking at this point in my life.  i DO, however, have the ten bucks it takes to buy a half-handle of old crow.  so that's how it works.
hurrah for alcohol - in moderation."

to the bullet points.
- trying to rid myself of some false notions and old beliefs.  as usual, it's not working.
- world war three is in the offing.  even newt gingrich says so.  i'm mostly saddened, but it's kind of exciting, i'm embarassed to say.
- i'll be off medication for a week while i wait to have money again.  i'm not excited about how that's going to go down.  considering holing up in my room with large quantities of booze until everything is halal again.
- bossa nova is the shit
- jeep auction ends saturday.  i will then have more money they i've ever had in my entire life ever.
- yard sale got postponed until this coming weekend.  whoops.
- definitely moving out at end of august.  uncertainty about ""what happens next"" and prospect of living alone again leaves me with flutters in the stomach.  not wholly unpleasant, most mostly.

the reserve has been hit - and there's seven days to go!  i will be a rich (by my standards) man, very, very soon.
awesome.
additional:  we're having a yard sale here (5214 35th Ave. NE, Seattle, WA 98105) tomorrow (Sunday, July 30) from 9 Ante-Meridian to 6 Post-Meridian.  so come buy our shit.  i'm probably just going to be selling a bunch of boring-ass books and far-too-large clothes.  so nerds and fat bastards are welcome!
we're also going to have free lemonade and cookies for browsers/buyers, so everybody should stop by for that nonsense at least."

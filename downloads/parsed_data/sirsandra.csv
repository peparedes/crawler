I like lyrics of songs in spanish better.
Maybe it's some sort of cognitive thing.
Maybe it's because songs in spanish generally are about more than love and such.
They usually are making some sort of comment on our home grown social ills.
Hardship and political unrest makes for better lyrics?
Or maybe it's just a cognitive thing... maybe I'm just ""wired"" to like songs in spanish better.
Maybe it's just my current phase.
I like dancing infront of my mirror a lot more when it's to spanish music.
Not even like salsa and other such popular dancey stuff in spanish. That too, but not exclusively.

What sucks about it, is this: it totally doesn't count for my major and it is SO MUCH WORK. We have insane ammounts of reading every night, 4 textbooks, one of which my prof actually wrote, plus PDF files he sends out, which are also required reading. What's grat about all this is that he lectures to the reading... he lectures well, a lot, very well structured (makes it quite easy to take kickass notes. My other classes aren't too bad... but then again I haven't really been to the other two classes that I consider ""real classes"" (psych and lit), thanks to the hurricanes and prof's absences. Let's just hope those aren't that bad as far as the workload.

"event","FAU and suncoast. About two weeks ago, I got a call from a really nice lady from FAU. It turns out, they have a limit on the number of credits you can bring in from high school and the credits she had received for me exceeded such number. The only solution really, was for me to drop some credits. She suggested I drop the bio credits, but since that was my hardest class, I was really reluctant to do so, thus, I said I'd think about it and call her back later. After thinking about it, I figured I'd drop something like my AP spanish credits, since I really didn't need them cuz I wanna take french. When I called her back, I ran into the surprise that I had to drop IB credits, not AP. In the end, I decided to drop a math credit. SOO I thought I was ok, but NO. That same day, about two hours later, I get another call from another nice FAU lady. It turns out that they hadn't gotten my AP credits at all when they called me the first time. So in the end, I had to drop pretty much all my AP credits and two math credits from IB. So, I could have gotten straight 4's and had the same ammount of credits I have now.

The downside is that none of my clothes fit the same now. Well, hopefully you kids will call me to do stuff now that I am again able to stay awake for extended periods of time.

I'm gonna miss my mommy while she's gone. I'm going to miss my granny too. In a sick way, I am kinda glad that my granny is finally ""giving up."" She's been in really bad shape for a couple of years now. She's always in pain, and I feel really bad because no one can really help her. I just want her to feel better already, I don't want her to suffer anymore. =(
Since my mah is going to be gone, I'm gonna have to be a big kid and take care of myself. Do my grocery shopping, make and go to my doc's appts and all that by myself. I know it seems ridiculous to a lot of you, but it really is very difficult for me. I get lost when I try to drive myself places, and I'm one of those people who wakes up with nightmares and wakes up their mommy. hmph.

When does allergy season begin/end? I was watching TV today and I realized I've been watching commercials for ""seasonal allergy"" medicine for like 10 months now. If there is such a thing as allergy season, then that's like having Santa in the master card commercial in April.

This past sunday, I ordered chicken parmesan from this place around my house. It cost me $15 with tip included... It was sooooooo big that I just finished eating it today. That's $5 a day for my entire nutritional needs, cuz I generally eat just dinner and lunch at school sometimes. Take that college meal plan."

Seems like I have done nothing productive this spring break. I still dont know what the font of Passage to India looks like. I did deal with a lot of stuff concerning red tape for college.

I finally got that fixed this morning though. What is my green card doing in Texas??

I saw my friends today. Weird as it may sound, I missed my friends a lot. A lot lot, not a little lot, but a lot lot. It's going to be strange next year without most of you around. Speaking of which, I got my housing thing for FAU today. College looks so expensive. 

So I'm talking to this old friend of mine from way back in the day. He's starting to take Japanese classes soon. I think 18 is too old to pick up a brand new language to which you have never been even minimally exposed to before.

I don't like the sound of their class sizes nor do I like the sound of the dungeon-y dorms. We have like 4 more weeks of real school when we come back after spring break. Maybe I should start going over stuff for those pesky IB exams, or maybe not.

I had a sunday for breakfast this morning, then I went to confession, because if I didn't go today, then that would have been over a year. Also,I saw Constantine last night. There should be a whole section in Blockbuster for ""Guilt trips for Catholics movies."" I went to church so early, I think I woke up the priest. I wanted to beat the Palm Sunday crowds. Also, I find that when you confess to a half-asleep priest, the penance is usually more moderate.  

I found out yesterday, that there is a new batman movie coming out.You know what that means? new batman shoes coming out as well.

So spring starts today. That means that hurricane season is closer. I hope it's not as shitty this year. There was a bad earthquake in Japan yesterday (or maybe it was this morning). Maybe it is true that the end of the world is near, or maybe I've been giving too much thought to Viviane and her Bible Code stories."

My mom went to Home Depot today. She bought all sorts of ant-killing devices and witch's brews. I hope they work. Speaking of ants, the fact that my feet bothered me all day made me be in a rotten mood, esp in first and third hour. I came to the realization that my bad mood makes me a more efficient mule. The system adores me when I'm in a bad mood. I sit there and do my work... and breathe fire when interrupted. Poor Alosa was the victim of my fury during psych. I did get all my work done, unlike anyone else in the class. Being an anti-social bitch is helpful. Same thing in math. Didn't speak to anyone and got all my work done in like two seconds. Good stuff. 

Freud came up in ToK today. Sorta. erg. Reminds me of this line from a song: ""I tear it down I tear it down and then it's born again."" No matter how many people prove Freud wrong with mountains of empirical evidence, his name and silly theories are just inmortalized in our culture. He wins.

Geez. Did I even spell that right?

Psych is FUN. We're talking about adolescence and such. Quite interesting. We just finished talking about the developing of gender roles. That was also tons of fun. Freud was almost never right, neither was his daughter (Anna Freud); they both just pull ideas out of their psychoanalytical butts and never bother to empirically test anything. Seriously... Freud's ideas ""came from"" his interviews with sexually molested middle-aged women. Not only was his sample population screwed up to begin with, but also the man never kept any sort of notes. I don't understand why he is hailed as the father of modern psychology by ""the populus"" when really, most, if not all modern research disproves his crazy theories. I like the cognitive perspective better. I like developmental psych... Piaget knew his stuff. Why isn't he hot stuff? How about Skinner and Little Albert? That's empirical ""proof"" if I ever saw it. Pavlov's dogs for crying out loud.
OK, sorry about the rant. I'm just mad at Freud's popularity today. Maybe that was all really penis envy and that was all a modified version of a ""Freudian slip.""

So I came home today and fed Pavi. He liked my mother's strange foreign food, which I hate btw. I had... a hot dog.

I miss second hour ToK, it was so much fun. I thought it had more...""substance"" (for a lack of a better word at the moment). Maybe though... it's just that it became increasingly difficult to say anything ""new and interesting"" in that class. It seems almost as if all that pertains to the ToK curriculum that is interesting has been exhausted and now it's just being recycled. That seems impossible though. It's supposed to be a philosophy-ish class, how could anyone exhaust it? Has anyone heard the song ""video killed the radio star"" well, maybe it's like ""notes killed independent thought,"" maybe not. Who knows.

So I woke up early this morning, and I had pizza for breakfast. Yum/ck.Then, I was overcome by the sudden urge to bake. It's weird, sometimes I just get random attacks of domesticity. So I made some chocolate chip cookies. My cookies are strange, I use dark chocolate for the chips. German dark is the only way to go when it comes to chips. I didn't use a cookie cutter,I never do, thus, my cookies are very imperfect in their shape. No 360 degree cookies come out of my oven.

I told Viviane to rent The Usual Suspects today. It's an excellent movie. I also told her to rent Freaky Friday for her mother. Mothers love family comedies. I rented Freaky Friday for my mom a while ago, and then she liked it so much I had to buy it for her. Bad movie taste must be a side effect of motherhood.

Romantic Comedies. Those culprits. What Women Want was on today. I'm not much of a chick flick gal myself, but I can rarely resist a Mel Gibson movie. It's slightly disappointing that the guy who played William Wallace and made me shed an ideological tear when in his last breath, screamed ""freeeeeeedom!"" made me laugh when he waxed his legs while proclaiming he hated the world today... he's a bitch he's a lover... etc.

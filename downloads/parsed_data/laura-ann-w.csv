3. SUMMER! ill be making massive amounts of trips to wilmington, outer banks, boone, and asheville and other places because i have free places to stay at all of those places with amazing friends and yeaaa it's gonna make for one hell of a summer!
4. possible SPAIN trip with my daddy. holy. shit. hope this works out, we both want it to and i'm fairly certain it will.

i'm sitting in my neighbors room right now. we're having a tea party and watching the OC all night because we decided that sleep is to unproductive! sandy cohen is the shittt

but yea, state has been so much fun! my roommate and i get along great, which is veryy lucky. i wass gonna do sorority rush, but dropped out after the first day, decided it wasn't for me. theres alot of really cool people on my hall which makes me happy because i dont have to go far if i want to find people to hang out with.
i have grown to love the dining hall, even though they yelled at me for trying to steal veggie burgers (dont worry, theyve only caught me once out of the many, many times)
my classes arent all that bad. exceptt for chemistry, sucks balls. we do alot of writing in english but i can deal. math and the rest of my classes are pretty easy so its quite nice.
parents weekend is this weekend so scoree i get to see the fam and ill make them take me grocery shopping, heheee

i miss so many people, but i know that i'll be able to see them all on breaks which makes me happy. the quad squad went to greenville to see rikki at ECU this weekend, it was alot of funn.
oh and my little brother peirced his own septum hahaha. lovess it!

well thats all for now folks!
hope everyones doing well in their own lives, see you around thanksgiving eh?"

"event","saturday was one of the best nights i've had in a very long time, and since this IS my journal i'm going to write about it...

the night started by just hanging out at katie's and then kyle booker's. i tried shooting stuff with carlton's bee-bee gun but i have shitty aim. from there we drove to a park in ballantyne, i enjoyed the car ride dancing in the back seat with no restrictions. the park was one of the coolest places ever. its a giant field in a circle of trees, with swingsets and slides and everything you would need. everyone sat in the middle of the field and i decided to dance and run around like a little kid. it was amazing. then erin started dancing with me and she never stopped for the rest of the night. we thought it might be a good idea to go to alex drummand's house because he was apparently having a party. this turned out to be a great idea because when we pulled up there were cars alll the way down the street. went downstairs and saw so many people and then went outside where of course all our friends were sitting, smokers are always outside. the entire night was just soo fun. adam took off all his clothes and did a cannonball in the pool, then screamed and got out because it was freezing. fucking hilarious. at like 4 we decided to go upstairs to try and find beds, but they were all taken so we had to make our own. fell asleep cuddling but only got like 30 minutes of sleep since none of us were tired. at 7 kyle convinced me to keep drinking with him. corona is especially good in the morning, btw. then i rode with him to IHOP and had a breakfast of coffee and hashbrowns. realized how sick i felt and went home and slept from 11-5. i don't think i would change anything about the entire night. AMAZING.

"event","another random post...

let me begin with a THANK GOD spring is on its way. i got to lay out last week for the first time in wayy too long. amen.

i don't know how to answer the question ""how have you been lately?"" anymore. one day can be perfect and then the next day it's like everything around me is crashing down (not to sound too melodramatic...) it might be because the weathers changing, apparently that affects a lot of people's moods. who knows.

here's a little breakdown:
-school=good. sure all the AP work can be stressful, but it's a lot less stressful when i realize- hey, i'm already into college! fuck this!- and then everything is ok. i spend most of my time at school either drawing/doodling, reading, writing notes, talking to whoever is close by, texting, thinking about what i'm doing that weekend/daydreaming, or playing tetris on my calculator (high score=6116 pts, 130 lines. badass)
-work=getting better. now that i'm comfortable around all the servers and other people, i really don't mind going to work. plus i just told the managers that i can't work friday or saturday nights anymore so i can still go out HAHA. but overall, my job is pretty sweet.
-health=horrible. i'm getting so out of shape, i disgust myself. this is the first year i haven't done track, and haven't been working out like i planned. plus being stoned all the time probably isn't helping..whatever.
(this is when i start getting bored with writing in this...)
-friends=amazing.
-family=...let's just say i can't wait to leave.
-everything else=overall, i'd say pretty good, with the exceptions of course.


i don't know why i ever write in this...hope you found this as entertaining as i didn't"

First we went to see ""Mighty Joe <strike>Yon</strike> Young."" We asked if we could go inside to see if she was already there. She wasn't there but we noticed that the theater was very, very small.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Cathy got there, we went in to see that ""Mighty Joe Young"" was sold out. So we saw ""A bug's life."" We all got our own drink, but we shore candy with a partner. My partner was Meaghan Pedlow.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the movie we went to Cathy's house. We ordered pizza, watched a movie, and played some games. We danced to music and had alot of fun. It was the first time I had ever been to her house and I was spending the night!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We played ""truth or dare"" and ""bloody Mary."" Then we all rolled out out sleeping bags and got in our pajama's. The next morning we had cupcakes for breakfast. Her mom gave us clips with our initials or name on it. Then our parents came and got us. It was real fun and I bet I will always remember that party.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The End</p>"

1.Italians are the greatest lovers
2.Italians are the greatest kissers
3.Italians make the best wise guys
4.Nobody loves their mamma like an italian
5.Italians are without a doubt the best looking people
6.It took an italian like Columbus to discover America
7.No one cooks finer cuisine than the italians
8.The Pope lives in italy
9.Italians have the toughest godfathers
10.Pacino, Brando, Scorsese, Parlanti, De Maggio, Pavarotti, Carollo, Mannino, Mario C and Pesci, they're all Italian
11.No nationality is more ""jocked"" then italians
12.The reason for the fact above is the italians are the loudest and the funniest people around
13.Italians have the only children who come in for dinner and leave three days later
14.Everything is the biggest and most expensive
15.Italian boys and girls think they're God's gifts to the world...and they're right

"event","It's strange that everytime I hear an Enya song it reminds me of home. 

More specifically it reminds me of my mom.. it reminds me of staring out the passenger window of the car on a rainy afternoon at home.

Just a random thought at a late hour. That is all."

"event","Yeah, I don't feel like cutting it, wanna FIGHT ABOUT IT!?


So, here's how it works:
1. Open your library (iTunes, Winamp, Media Player, iPod, etc)
2. Put it on shuffle
3. Press play
4. For every question, type the song that's playing
5. When you go to a new question, press the next button
6. Don't lie and try to pretend you're cool... (It will compromise the divination :-) )
7. When you're finished tag some other people to do it!


Opening Credits: Space Ghost - ""Hero In His Own Mind (Part One)""
OMG That is just absolutley perfect.. does it count tho? It's not EXACTLEY a song... so funny XD

Waking Up: FFVII - ""Shinra Corporation""
That... can't be a good start to this movie. What will happen next?!

First Day At School: Michelle Branch - ""Ordinary Day""
Well! That certainly explains that.. .BORING! What now? :D

Falling In Love: FFX - ""Victory Fanfare""
YAY! I AM VICTORIOUS OF LOVE! *love and peace hands*

Fight Song: Negative Space - ""Let Me Know""
Strange song to fight to, but I can see it happening. With a chainsaw!

Breaking Up: Elton John - ""Rocket Man""
That's certainly a way to do it. I don't think I could take being in a relationship with someone who was in space all the time. That's way too much ""long distance"".

Prom: Danny Elfman - ""[Untitled Hidden Track]""
This is from the nightmare before christmas cd.. and.. well.. that would be a very goth prom now wouldn't it?

Life: FFVIII - ""Never look back""
Yes yes.. I have too many FF songs. But hey, 'never look back'? Hell yeah!

Making babies: Space Ghost - ""Mah nuh mah nuh""
OH DEAR GOD, I'M LAUGHING SO HARD RIGHT NOW! XD

Mental Breakdown: Darude - ""Feel The Beat""
Going insane.. with an awesome base line! :D

Driving: 311 - ""Running""
Kinda slow for my driving tastes, but still, good song.

Flashback: ?? - ""Flight of the bumblebee""
Dear god that flashback must have been very fast and very confusing.

Getting back together: Zelda Theme
Uh, okay?

Wedding: ??? - ""Just about enough""
WELL! What a romantic way to become man and wife.

Birth of Child: Sammy Davis Jr. - ""Baby, it's cold outside.""
OMG!! ANOTHER AWESOME ONE! ""No seriously, baby, it's cold outside the womb, like really.""

Final Battle: Cowboy Bebop - ""Moikoikoinuda""
Another strangely surreal fight scene... very cowboy bebop-ish!

Death Scene: Saliva - ""Superstar""
I have no idea, I haven't even listened to this song yet. XD

Funeral Song: FFVIII - ""Chocobo Song""
OH HELL YES! :D

End Credits: Josh Groban - ""Never Let Go""
So wonderfully moody.. I dig it!





okay clas time buh bye!"

"event","I want you to get mad! 

I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad. 

You've got to say, 'I'm a HUMAN BEING, Goddamnit! My life has VALUE!' So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell,

"event","Here is a series of promises that actually speak of true friendship:

1. When you are sad -- I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad.
2. When you are blue -- I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.
3. When you smile -- I will know you finally got laid.
4. When you are scared -- I will rag on you about it every chance I get.
5. When you are worried -- I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be until you quit whining.
6. When you are confused -- I will use little words.
7. When you are sick -- Stay the hell away from me until you are well again. I don't want whatever you have.
8. When you fall -- I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

Remember. A good friend will help you move and a REALLY good friend will help you move a body.

Let me know if you ever need me to bring a shovel. (Especially you Itchy, you homicidal maniac XD)"

"event","I was thrown into New Orleans nostalgia by my father today. But with the help of Pearl Jam, and Alice playing ZeldaOOT in the other room, I'm comforted. 

This isn't home. It never will be. But I'm willing to be homeless until I find what I'm looking for. And when I do, it will be marvelous. I will bask in that glow. 

Good lord people if I've ever preached anything, I'm preaching now. Don't take anything for granted. Appreciate what you have and how it makes you feel. Cherish it with all your senses. Remember. 

I've come to realize that while it seemed to be a curse in the beginning that I remembered everything I remembered, it's a comfort now. Like seeing an old friend. And it leaves me feeling incredibly loved."

"event","Ok. SO.

After staying up till damn near 4am last night playing: <a href=""http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/davinci/main.html""> This</a> and <a href=""http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/davinci/index-utc.php""> this</a> (<a href=""http://flash.sonypictures.com/movies/davincicodequest/"">this</a> too, but it's ongoing), I thought I'd share my findings because well, I like to humor myself =D 

<lj-cut text=""Rantings and ravings of a mad woman - Da Vinci Code spoilers ahead!""> 

So. I was on the bus on my way home from school on tuesday, and was about to get off. As I had to bookmark, I went to bend the page I was on down. I usually look at the page number before I bend it just as insurance so I'll remember it, but instead of a page number it had the letters ""SOS"". I was all like ""Er?"". Then throughout reading I noticed other things, as listed below:

p.60 - ""Ankh Fendile""
p.95 - ""The De Lancs Code"" 
p.138 - ""Das Brilli""
        also, the word ""numbers"" seems to be in a drastically different font for no appearent reason.
p.141 - ""The La Sufrete Code""
p.155 - ""SOS"" (as page number)
p.192 - ""Reon Tigaldo""
p.217 - ""The De Ysosy Code""
p.262 - ""Mer Reve""
p.322 - ""***"" (as page number)

I started with ""De Lancs"" as the word 'candles' jumped out at me. 
Similarly in ""De Ysosy"", 'Odyssey' came out.
I took a stab at ""Mer Reve"" and came up with 'Vermeer' who was a Dutch Baroque Era Painter..
and it took awhile but I found out of ""Das Brilli"", 'Billiards' and from ""Ankh Fendile"", 'knife handle'.

Starting to sound a little like 'Clue' >.>;

I no idea what the hell ""Reon Tigaldo"" was, and after much frustration I had a look on google. One hypothesized it was 'Go to Ireland', which sounds silly, but who knows maybe thats it.

As far as ""SOS"", ""***"" and ""numbers"", I didn't come up with anything, and from what it looks like from google, no one else really had either. I wonder if the page numbers have anything to do with it?</lj-cut>

Anyway, I really recommend playing those puzzles in the above links. They are -really- awesome, and it helps to have read 'The Da Vinci Code', but you could prolly pull it off without it.

Happy puzzling! =D"

"event","20 ways to scare your roommate:

1. Make brown-bag lunches for your roommate every morning. Give them to him/her before he/she goes to class.

2. Every time you enter the room, sit in a chair, lean back too far, and fall over backwards. Laugh hysterically for about ten minutes. Then, one day, repeat the falling-over exercise, but instead of laughing, get up, look at the chair sternly, and say, ""It's not funny anymore.""

3. Read with a flashlight when the lights are on. Pretend to read without one when the lights are out, remarking every so often how great the book is.

4. Get a surfboard. Put it on your bed. Stand on it, and pretend to surf for about fifteen minutes. Then, pretend to ""wipe out,"" and fall off the bed onto the floor. Pretend you are drowning until your roommate comes over to ""rescue"" you.

5. Keep a hamster as a pet. Buy a blender, and make milkshakes every day. Then, one day, get rid of the hamster. Make a shake using a lot of ketchup. When your roommate comes in, look at the shake, look at the empty cage, and tell your roommate, ""I was curious.""

6. Make toast for breakfast every morning, but don't plug the toaster in. Eat the plain bread, looking at the toaster angrily, and complain that the toaster doesn't know what it's doing. If your roommate suggests plugging it in, go on a tangent about fire-safety hazards.

7. Pack up all of your things and tell your roommate that you're going away to ""find yourself."" Leave, and come back in about ten minutes. If your roommate asks, explain that you're not a hard man to find.

8. Never speak to your roommate directly. If you need to ask or tell him/her something, go to another room and call him/her on the phone.

9. Every night, before you go to bed, beg your roommate for a glass of water. When he/she brings it, dump it on the floor and immediately go to sleep. If he/she ever refuses to bring you a glass of water, lie on the bed and pretend to be dying of dehydration, making annoying gagging sounds, until he/she does so.

10. Every time the phone rings, turn on the stereo at full volume and begin to violently slam-dance with your roommate. If he/she asks about it, say, ""Oh, that damn hypnotist....""

11. Hang a picture of your roommate on the wall. Throw darts at it. Smile at your roommate often, saying things like, ""How nice to see you again.""

12. Get a can of beans. Label them, ""Jumping beans."" Eat them, and then jump around the room. Get another can of beans. Label them, ""Dancing beans."" Eat them, and then dance around the room. Get another can of beans. Label them, ""Kill Your Roommate beans."" Eat them, smiling at your roommate.

13. Every time your roommate falls asleep, wait ten minutes, and then wake him/her up and say, ""It's time to go to bed now.""

14. Insist that your roommate recite the ""Pledge Of Allegiance"" with you every morning.

15. Recite ""Dr. Seuss"" books, all the time. Eventually, think up melodies for the words and sing them, loudly, directly to your roommate. If he/she tells you to stop, act offended and spend the day in bed.

16. Put up traffic signs around the room. If your roommate doesn't obey them, give him/her tickets. Confiscate something your roommate owns until he/she pays the tickets.

17. Walk, talk, and dress like a cowboy at all times. If your roommate inquires, tell him/her, ""Don't worry little buckaroo. You'll be safe with me.""

18. Complain that your elbows, knees, and other joints have been bothering you. Get a screwdriver, and pretend to ""fix"" them.

19. Paint abstract paintings, and title them things like, ""Roommate Dying in a Car Crash,"" and ""Roommate Getting Whacked in the Head with a Shovel."" Comment often about how much you love the paintings.

20. Wear glasses, and complain that you can never see anything. Bump into walls and doors. Put your clothes on backwards. Say, ""Who's that?"" every time your roommate enters the room. When you're not wearing the glasses, act like you can see fine."

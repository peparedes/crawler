And wither doth it go?  
Yet in its gentle passing do we not feel it's soft velvet touch upon our check?
Like the flutter of a butterflys wings, now senced, now lost!
For all it's reality we cannot reach out and touch, and grasp, the wind.  It is there, yet it is not!  How real too is our sence of sight when we see, in dreams, the ones we love.  Again we see them and talk with them, and love again.  Yet are they there?  Will they come when we call?  Can we see and do what we will?  Yes and yes again, tis true?  All that which we desire to see, to experience, in our dreams, is ours for the asking will and it shall come.  Ask and it shall be given.  know that the power is within us and all that we desire shallbe ours."

It seems to me were more than that. Something more passionate, something like love. Something like commitment. Something you just don't seem to understand. I love you with my heart, why doesn't that seem good enough. Well worry no longer because that will never happen again. I shouldn't have to explain myself, you should know how I fell."

 Well what to start off with. hum. I have'nt had a sober day in about three weeks. It's wake up get high,get high,get high. Go to work high. Leave work it high. If I have work in the mornings I pull myself out of bed maybe take a couple hits off a pipe, go in to work, work my ass off, get off work go home take a shower go get high take some pills uppers downers whatever I can get or got, get high as much as I can or until I have to be home, come home and then go to bed. I hav'nt been eating much lately I'm trying to lose weight and not eat sonic food as much as I can.
 
 I have a ""boyfriend"" Steph was trying to get us ""talking"" something to do when I'm board or just someone cool to chill with, ha. He automatically thought we were going out. We never talked about going out or anything like that!! I only hung out with him a couple of times and usually Steph was there. It was fuck up right?.  So I was like whatever, hes only seventeen going to be eighteen soon. I know young. But he is pretty cute, and funny as hell. It's funny I really don't know if I like him like that or not. I'm thinking hes cool to hang out with buts thats it. But I mean hell Stephen told me to just get over it. 
 
 Well you know what fuck him. He loves me but cant be with me. Yeah ok is that code for I want you but I want alot of other girls to and I dont want to have to deal with you. ahhh. I'm mean what the fuck is that. I think about having sex with other girls when I'm with you because your love is'nt good enough for me or you don't give me everything I need. You have some issues. But I want you to chang yourself into someone I think you are. In only a couple of mons, when I been like this ever since I was about 3. I mean I'm 19 years old going to be twenty in about fives months, I don't need anything to sirius right now, I mean I want to be able to party with people, have fun. Just because you have a problem with those people does'nt mean that I have to, too. 
 
 I do want something to be there. Like just being good friends. Someone to told you when your sad, to tell you every things going to be ok. just someone, someone to keep you sane,someone to slap you or call you a bitch when your going crazy because everyone around you gives you new ideas of how things are and should, will, or supposed to be. And sometimes there thoughts get stuck on me and every time that happens it just piles more and more thoughts in me and then the more confused I get. Like a foggy cloud you can't see where your going. I feel like I'm going insane. I feel like I have'nt stopped in days.  
 
Well fuck in the words of Robert-thats how it goes."

I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face

But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending it's as much as i can take
and you're so independent
you just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break

You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting

I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you

Why can't you just forgive me
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made along the way
But I always find a way to keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting

You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting

I can't take another second of you not touching me,I grab your head and pull it toward mine, I start to kiss you, my body starts to get hot, I have this warm tingling sensation coming over my body because of the way your touching me,I have never felt this feeling,until I found you, It's like were almost melting into each other . You throw me on the bed, we start to rip each others clothes off you start making love to me and there's a warm wave of sensation coming over my body like waves, and we have felt one another. We get up and get dressed not really saying to much to each other. But you know were thinking were thinking the same thing. 


It was crazy two people making love. Do you think it brings people closer? I mean it's very personal to experience that with with some. To open yourself to someone that much. Committing yourself in that way. I experienced that with the person I love. And now I wish I had'nt. I mean yes I gaven myself up before. But not like this. It felt to be so in love with everything. To feel that way with someone. Was incredible. To know the person you were making love to loved you the same. What I would give for just a hug, for you to hold me your arms your arms again.  Tell me it's going to be ok."

I am an emotional freak who bottles averything up inside of me until I freak out. It ain't pretty. And it's usually on Stephen. I can't show the people I care about the most my true emotions because I'm scared. Fuck, show  people I care about,lets try I can't really show anyone my true feelings.He says he does'nt know me. But he was with me for so long. He said he was'nt happy being with me any more. I guess he wanted something new. We can't be ""friends"" because I love him to much, I'd get mad if he was with another girl. I don't understand where I lost myself. I am not the same person I was when I meet him. He wanted to try and help me so I could beable to tell him how I felt, I guess he got sick of helping me. I don't understand why this is such a problem. This is the second person I have lost to this. What the fuck is worng with me. Why can't I tell people how I really fell? Fuck this life."

So what would you do??

I got to see my mother after four years. And she tells me she wants me to meet this guy (i don't remember his name). I say ok why, she did'nt want to tell me because she thought I would get upset. I thought to myself how bad could this be. I'm used to bad things so bring it on bitch. joke. I made her tell me. WELL.. A long time ago her and my father had a fight she left him for two weeks, some guy came to her rescue (the guy she wanted me to meet). Well her and this guy had sex. She and my father had got back together. In this period of two weeks she came up pregnant, yes with me. So I may not have the father I thought I had. There are other people that know this also. And some say I look and act like alot of that family. 

Whats a girl to do. Do I meet this guy, or just say no and foget about it.

She shot herself in the head, the fucking head. Good she deserved to die away. 
Like a fly on the wall no one really noticed her.
Hurt by everyone shes loved.

I still don't know what is happening with my dad and Lori. But my father is driving me nuts. I feel so bad for him, b/c he's all sad, and hurt. I know how it feels.

I think I might, I am always so worried about how I treat everyone else, how everyone else feels and trying to help them. I have forgotten about me. I know how I feel, but how to deal with it. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if anyone has ever wanted something so bad it makes them insane. I have, I am wright now. And then to just give up on it. I can't. I just want to be happy, for a little while. I wish I could tell people(someone)how I really feel (more than I have said). But its hard knowing how he feels towards other people to do that. And if I did say what I had to, would it matter, confessing my love and it does'nt even matter. I hate love, I hate boys they break my heart, I hate life, I hate feel for someone and not knowing why, and my feelings not mattering much. I wish I could just hang out get drunk, and not worry about anything. Thats what I really want. 

All-in-all the day is good except for someone writing comments in my journal. What kind of shit is that. Hopefully its not true. I have to say it did make me a little mad, jealous. But at the same time I can't care. He's not mine anymore.

We also got the house they appraised it at 40,00$$ we only needed like 36,00$$ though, so were all good. And now you would think everything should be peachy because all of my fathers worries are gone?? But no him and Lori are still fighting. Shes tried to kick him out last night, he would'nt leave. Also I think I heard Lori say that my father finger's his own asshole. Fucking Gross. But funny do what you got to I guess. We finally saw Lou last night. How long have we said we needed to go see him and finally. He is a cutie who has dabbled in anal sex. yumm. I think he has cut his hair. What do you think Court? Hope so. I've also been trying to talk to James but for some reason he does'nt seem like he wants to talk. Depressing yes. For that matter he does'nt even seem like he even wants to hang out anymore, due to last weekends excursion. Oh shit. Hi CAT. Meow
So now I'm waiting for something bad to happen. Just give it time I know something will happen, it all ways does. 
I'm angry today I heard some things I really did'nt like. OH well it's not like were together anyway right??
Soooo... Court brought her new toy over yesterday. All I have to say is WOW!! hehe. Not as goo but its there for you?? Right?? Fun times. A story for the gran kids if I can ever find a guy to have kids with, then those kids have kids. You know how it works. I think when I get a little head, get it a little head. yumm. in some money I'm going to get one of the Devil Girls porn. I really want to see them. And a question I have is...How long can you or the average person go with out sex?? (Court I don't know how long I can last) I'm to horney to masterbate now. You know what ever shall I do. Oh well. It's not that important any way.

"event","Today is starting out pretty well I'm still really down about things. I'm right now eating a pop-tart, watching a movie basically what I do every morning. I'm also hoping we will get out of school early so I can get back in my bed and sulk about things. I just hope today goes good for me. I need a good day. 
Last night I Finally have figured out what I want to do about things, now its just up to another person on what they would like to do, for my plans to work. I really want things to be ok. Please let them be ok. I feel so out of place today. So many emotions are running through my head a little bit of happiness, sad, angry, alone, scared, hurt, unloved, disgusted with my self. But all in all I guess I'm ok.  I love you so much."

"event","This weekend was very interesting. It has been one of the most exciting ones yet. But also a very unhappy one for me also. I still don't know how to handle it. I don't know what to do about it either. I can't get it off my mind, I'm so hurt. I should have known this would happen to me. Get hurt again Tiff thats fine. I really don't know what else could possibly happen to me that will hurt me. I am seriously sick of everything already. It always has to be something does'nt it. I get alittle bit happy then everything goes to shit again. I'm confused about everything I really don't know what to believe anymore, or who to believe anymore. I don't know why I don't just give up already and let 'whoever' do what they want. But at the same time I want to wait it out and see what will happen in the end, but all think about is what if I still get hurt in the end. I would rather just give it up now and be hurt now. Than to keep growing more and more in love. I don't think I could give up. I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like I've just been lead around the whole time. I can't take it anymore. I wish people would'nt hide things from me also. That hurts a lot to, when the person you love and the person that says they love you keep things from you. Why. Maybe I really don't get it. I don't get anything anymore. That really disappoints me. if anyone has any suggestions let me know."

"event","So I went to bed early last night. And got woken up in the middle of the night by my father and Lori doing it. Then her screaming at my father for something like: I guess she was sleeping, he tore off her pj pants and was doing her. And she's like is that how you treat me, whats wrong with you. She was really flipping out over it. Yes that is fucking sick. 
So I really did'nt get much sleep. Today, Court, Erica, Brandy, Bo, and I are going rollerskating then to twist. This should be a good time. Christine and AJ will be there to. I was kind of hopeing another friend would be there but I doubt he will be coming:(  
I only got a works in progress on my senior project paper. So that means I still have to work on it. That fucking sucks. They said its basically grammar problems maybe James will help me with it? Wink wink, nudge nudge. Other than that I guess they liked it. 
I've been thinking lately I really want to get into a fight so I can just beat all of my anger and worry out on someone else besides me. 
I've also been doing alot of day dreaming, I love to day dream, about how I want things to go in my life, what would happen if something bad were to happen. I don't know stuff like that. What sex would feel like right now. hehe. It's true it's true. 
I woke up in pretty good mood today. I just hope the rest of the day goes good."

"event","Last I went with Trisha to get her nails all done up. It smelled so bad in the place she went. I guess all of them do. Then I had to watch kids while Lori and and father were out drinking. 
I went to bed upset last night and had some really horrible dreams. I kept waking up in cold sweats and shit. I woke up in a horrible mood from the lack of sleep I had got. I also handed in my application yesterday. All on my own. 
I don't feel good today. Not sick. 

SCOOBY DOO 2 is coming out March 26th. I can't wait.  

I have realized that:
I am fine, what I want is fine, my dreams are fine, my love is fine, what I need is fine, how I feel is fine, my life is fine, how I don't feel is fine, my parents are fine, my brothers and sisters are fine, my head is fine, my friends are fine, my enemys are fine, school is fine, my home life is fine,  finefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefinefine.

"event","So this weekend was ok. A little bit of upsetness at first starting with Thursday. It was the first day I saw James since we broke up. Ah. My father was being an ass. It progressively got better. Until Sat yes Valentines Day. Ok so my boyfriend broke up with so no Valentine for me. So one of my friends and I were going to go out together, since I did'nt get my id she did'nt want to. I was'nt to upset but that hurt a lot. I spent the day by myself in my room. Sunday sleep the day away again. I keep trying to get James to hangout with me but it does'nt seem to be working for me. Monday I don't remember. Tuesday Christine, AJ, and her lil brother took me to the movies we saw 50 first dates. I was really stupid. I thought. The past two days I have been in a really good mood. I'm very giddy and shit I'm not used to this. It makes me think something bad is going happen, soon. Today Christine is also going to come visit me. Shes so loud. But I love it. Fri I think is twist, Chris wants me to go I just might Court is going to so, ok. James please go so I can see you. It will probably be the only way I can. Please Please Please. I could give you some money to get in if you need it. Later"

"event","I am sad again today. I still can't stop crying. And that does'nt help when I'm trying to at least make it look like I'm ok. Why does everything feel like it hurts so much. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I try not to think about things, I feel alone once again. I miss ***** alot to.
 
I filled out a application to turkey yesterday. Courtney is making me walk down to hand it in because I am very lazy so I probley won't unless I'm made to. 

Justin called me yesterday. We talked about a lot of things, relationships basically, ones that he had, onces that I lost. He said James sounded like a good guy for me, he was. I guess that helped some, not much.
 
And I'm also ready to fucking hit that Mike kid in the face, he kissed me on the side of the face. ewwww. Hes always trying to give me hugs and shit. Ok I just broke up with my love and you think I want some guy well kid touching me. NO!!!! I don't think so. 

I still hav'nt got my id yet. So hopefully I will have it Saturday, for the porn shops. That should be fun!! 
Erica--should we still invite that Mike kid. (do you see what I mean about him being so touchy?).  I might have to end up watching kids. If that occurs mabey you could spend the night and I ask my father to get something to drink. If thats ok with you. I don't know if they have plans or not. 

My father had to go pick up Amber from the police station last night. She stole someones purse or some shit like that. What a fuck up. Now I'm sure my father is going to be in a bad mod because she is there. And all the fighting starts again. Not that I have enough on my mind.
  
This weekend I think (not Sat of course well depends on babysitting goes) I'm just going to try to drink or something of the sort. It's not like I have anything better to do now anyway. Yum Yum Yum. 

I hope my father is going to take me for something new for my birthday. No he still has'nt done that yet either, I'm not counting on it anyway. I try much as possible to not take things people tell me for granted, for some reason when I do it always ends up hurting me in som way. I guess I should be used to it by now.

James--if you want to hangout anythime soon, I have a half day tomorrow, no school mon an tues. Only if you want."

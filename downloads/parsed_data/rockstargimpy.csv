"event","<p>So...I just got yelled at because I had a ""tone"" that made my dad feel stupid and like a jerk. Oh, he went off on me; trying to make me feel the same way apparently. Even said ""fuck"". Whoa jeez! :-P&nbsp;<br /><br />He should feel stupid because that's what I think of him and my&nbsp;mum half that time. Stupid...very stupid and selfish.<br /><br />Can't wait til I'm off to college...hopefully away from home.</p>"

"event","<p>So today was the best I've had in a VERY long time. I miss my threesomes with my two best friends, along with Noonan....so I guess it's really a foursome...<br /><br />I was told to post something....because I've apparently had a LJ for a good while now and I totally forgot about it. So yeah...<br /><br />This should also be good for my mental health, hah...some of you know, or should know, what I'm talkin' about. If not, well, if I keep up with this...thing, you may find out. </p>"

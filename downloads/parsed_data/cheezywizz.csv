<OL>
<LI>&nbsp;Paige and Richard are having some problems:</LI></OL>
<UL>
<LI>&nbsp;Ryan Zelinsky found a note on the floor that said: Will you go out with me!? signed, Paige b!</LI>
<LI>There are some problems with that because: Paige doesnt ask people out and definatly not through notes! It wasnt her hand writing! And That could of been Paige Brink but I doubt it.</LI>
<LI>Now Richard might break up with her!! :'(</LI></UL>

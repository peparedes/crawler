"event","So i never like come on this thing but i have nothing better to do tonight. I hate this house with a passion. Everyone has been a d-bag to me all day and i wasnt having a good day to begin with. I let my sister wear my favorite shirt to school and my flat black shoes, and she repays me by being the biggest asshole ive ever met. i hate her and she should go get her own life and stop trying to live mine. i cant have any clothes that i love that my sister doesnt take a wear. ughh i hate her so much. ive been wicekd stressed out lately, i dont know why but i have. and in the worst mood. and i got in a fight with one of my good friends and started crying. i dont know what wrong with me lately. i hate it. i cant wait till like the end of summer. ill be away from this house for almost a month. i know i might miss my parents a little. but im not going to miss anything about being home. i hate it. they dont understand me.blahh i hate it. i have no one to talk to about this so i have to write it somewhere and i dont wanna write it on paper where my family can find it. i just wanna leave for a few days to get rid of this. this week is going by extremely slow and i hate it. worked sucked cuz now that we have DDR all the kids do it argue every 5 seconds about everything. i wanted to punch them in the face to shut them up. i probly shoudlnt be saying that but i think anyone would say that if they were trying to deal with the same situation. summer plans are kinda stressing me out. eventhough its so far way but it is idk why. like my two big plans are kinda overlapping. and idk if i would wnana take a plane all the way to ireland by myself. id be wicked nervous. prom is stressing me out and thats like not till may 26th. my moms pissing me off about buying a dress and idk who to take as a date. and i hope ppl that i want to go really go or i will be alone. i hate my school and everyone in it. they all think they are the shit and they really suck and i hate the, and they all talk about eachother behind their backs when they pretend to be wicekd good friends. fuck them. i bet no one will even read this. but now that i think about it, i dont even care. im writing this just to get all my feelings out so yeah. well bye.

"event","this weekend wasnt amazing but wasnt bad. Friday i already talked about in the last entry. that was fun. saturday was kinda sad but got better when some friends came over. I was suposed to go bowling on saturday with a cute boy mike and one of his friends and katie, but that never worked out becasue both the guys has basketball games. So i sat around all day waiting for a yes or a no. But i did get to drive around the neighborhood with my gma. it was a mess. i couldnt pull out of the driveway because my neighbor came and parked in the driveway so that sucked. I was pretty much like diagonal across the driveway. embarassing. But i got to drive my mom and gma to Micheals. but my mom yelled at me too much adn wouldnt let me drive them over to the mall. ps. i suck at parking. but that night kerisa and erin came over. which was fun. we took some awsome pics outside in the cold. and then we just hung out till like 12 or sumthing. this days going by so slow. right now i feel like it should be monday. im debating on going to church tonite or not. i havent been in a while and i dunno if i can get back into going. i love going and seeing everyone that i havent seen in a while. and praying. its just that there are times were i sit there and no one talks to me. yeah i try to talk to people but sumtimes after i finish what im saying they just walk away. there have been a few nights where i have been so close to crying but i didnt want anyone seeing me. but that was mostly at prayer nights. not at church. but there a life night tonite and i dunno if i want to go because those are the places and things i get ignored at. like sumtimes people are going through hard times and im with them nad i talk to them. but then another day that person will not really talk to me that much and ill be left alone. i know i should probly just go up to people and start talking so i dont feel left out. but i try and sumtimes they just go on with their own little conversations. maybe i will just go tonite and see how it all works out. well im going to stop now before i get into a bad mood.
peace"

"event","today was pretty good. school wasnt that bad. we didnt really do anything. and in eglish it was really fun. i won the like ""around the world game"" it was with the weeks vocab words. I totally didnt even lookd at them at all this week until like 5 mins before the game. and I WON! yay i got ten extra points on a wicked easy quiz which totally excites me. becasue last year i failed english and this wear im passing and i got like an 86 average last term! well enough of that. work was awsome today. we only have to watch 4 kids becase the other like 10 were at the ""social."" We just sat in the gym and talked about boring stuff and we left early so i wont get much money. but its better than nothing. so me, jess and kerisa planned to hang today but it ended up just being me and jess. but heidi and ron met up. well we went to the mall for like an hour which was alright. then we went to the movies and we saw Big Mamas House2. it was wicked funny. except there were tons of 8th grade whores in the movie and they wouldn't shut up. i think they got kicked out though. but overall it was a good day and night. Tomorrow im supposed to go bowling with a cute boy mike and one of his band memebers mike and katie. it should be fun. i havent been bowling in the longest time. i suck at bowling, but bowling is the type of thing you can be bad at but still have tons of fun. and theres never an akward moment. so im excited. well im wicked tired. its been a long day. so im going to hit the sack.

peace out girl scout.

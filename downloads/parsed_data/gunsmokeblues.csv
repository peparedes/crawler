"event","The weekend has proved to be time spent on catching up with some of the trends of this world. My latest obsession? James Bond. I don't know why, but that man has <i>class</i>. Talk about a role model I wish I had had back on <strike>Gunsmoke</strike> Dustball. I probably would have done something different with my life then. Heh.

On another note, if anyone knows of a piano that is for sale or if anyone <i>has</i> a piano they want to sell, I'm all ears. I can't find anything cheap around here and being on a low-budget salary as is, I can't spend four-grand on a piano. Though <a href=""http://www.pianoworld.com/adimages/GV6021705.jpg"">this</a> one is beautiful. Again, four grand.

Damnit.

<font color=""white"">I had a little trip back home. Legato informed me that he is ""looking into"" things in Desai. Whatever the means, it doesn't sound pleasant. But Bluesummers is taking things once step at a time - since he was placed in the coffin, he has had time to muse on things I'd rather not think about. On top of that, I think he is starting to regenerate. That could be bad news for me - the last thing I want is a walking Legato.

Other than that, I have been hearing more from Chapel, which is peculiar. I figured he would keep his distance from me here, but I guess that isn't the case. Hn.

Character:
Name: Midvalley the Hornfreak, Born Victor Michelangelo Midvalley, Nickname: Middie
Game/Series:  Trigun
Age: 26
Major: I was thinking that, if it was all right with the moderators, he could be a music teacher? If not, his major would be music.
Personality: Midvalley is what many would call a suave Jazz Man. Calm, collected and utterly flirtatious, Midvalley is a mix of both the old and the new. He is courteous, a hopeless romantic and humble. However, there are two sides to every coin, and Midvalley does have his faults. He has a horrid envy streak and his lust for the company of women can sometimes overpower his judgement. Midvalley is also extremely territorial about things, which would explain his tenacity in battle. His passionate about who he is and what he stands for and he'll defend that with his life.
Sexual Preference and Why: Oh god, Middie likes the women. As said before, women blind his judgement quite frequently and he'd never think about bedding a male.
Background:

Midvalley was born an orphan of the church of July City. A humble child, he mostly kept to himself and usually avoided the religious atmosphere that surrounding the Christian Orphan Association. He wasn't passionate about the teachings of Christ and God and he found them to be nothing more than bed-time stories for children. This got Midvalley in a lot of trouble with the nuns within the church and when he was about ten years of age, he left, taking the only thing he had from his original family: an old tenor sax.

Armed with the rusted tenor, Midvalley hoped bus to bus, city to city. Eventually, he began picking up the instrument and that became his true passion. At fifteen, his name began popping up frequently at local bars as ""the littlest jazz man"". Midvalley took to this well and soon, he was in a traveling blues band that toured all through Planet Gunsmoke. On his travels, he picked up two more saxophones and got his original tenor refurbished by a good friend of his in the music business. Everything was going splendid and for once in his life, Midvalley felt invincible.

That was when disaster struck. After one of his gigs, Midvalley found himself facing the barrel of the gun. The thief wanted his saxaphone and everything he had in his wallet. Midvalley refused and he got into a bit of a brawl with the assailant. For a good ten minutes they brawled and Midvalley managed to bust out the thief's kneecap with his sax case. But they cost him. As soon as the thief regained his senses, he shot Midvalley square in the chest.

Fear took hold of the young Jazz Man's body as he felt himself slowly dying in the alleyway. His life had been cut short as so many of his idols' lives had been and he had yet to make it big. Thankfully for Victor, though, someone was there watching him.

A week later, Midvalley woke up in the infirmary of a church. Next to his bed was a green apple and a note that read as follows:

""For you survival tactics, we offer you a choice. You can either die now or become one of us. The choice is yours. There is a slow acting poison in your system right now. The only way to cure it is by eating that apple at your bed side.

Heaven or Hell, you have a choice.

Sincerely,
Chapel.""

By then, Midvalley could feel the poison racing through his system and he did what any other human would do; he snatched up the apple and began to consume it. Not fifteen minutes after, he felt his body begin to calm down. That was when a hand lifted him back onto his feet. From then on, he was considered part of the elite team known as the Gung-Ho Guns.

Now, years later, Midvalley has become a crucial member of the team of assassins. Armed with a few firearms and his saxophone, he turns to the University to do two things with his life: find Vash and bring him to the people that saved him and teach college-going students how to appreciate and play Jazz."

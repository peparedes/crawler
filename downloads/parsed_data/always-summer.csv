"event","This morning I went to the grocery store. After I'd picked up a pineapple, it hit me that the grocery store was <em>absurdly</em> crowded for a Thursday morning and that I was in danger of being run over by a soccer mom with three shreiking children in her carriage. It was also way too hot. Claustrophobia set in and stuff started getting fuzzy, so I decided I was leaving and shoved my way into the express&nbsp;(10 items or FEWER, thankyou)&nbsp;line with the pineapple.<br /><br />The approximately 15-year-old emo-coiffed cashier (stay in school, children) looked at my pineapple and said: 'That's it?'<br />'There are too many people here. I can't do this right now,' I replied.<br />'Well. I'm glad to see you have your priorites in order,' he informed me, and then proceeded to ring me up.<br /><br />I'm still wondering what the hell he meant by that."

"event","Yesterday I went shoe shopping for Sam's wedding. She had mentioned a pair she'd seen at Off Broadway that she thought we'd all like. I went to DSW, thinking, hey, same thing, and came up short. Upon calling her, I learned she doesn't actually care if we have matching shoes, just as long as they're 'platinum, strappy, and open toe.'<br /><br />So I agonized for a while, texted photos to Rowan, and eventually decided on a sparkly little sandal with a 2-inch heel.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then I didn't follow through because I can't buy&nbsp;lame prom-ish&nbsp;shoes I really don't like, especially when I'm told I can get whatever I want within the guidelines. So, determined to find something 'platinum, strappy and open-toe that I might actually want to wear again some day post-wedding, I came home and did a little research.<br /><br />Polling the readership:<br /><br />Option A: HOT. But maybe too much? That is a 4.5-inch heel and&nbsp;it ain't MY wedding.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.chineselaundry.com/img/shoes/BBELE4Q6ESIL_L.jpg"" /><br />Or option B: CLASSIC. Functional and easy at 3 inches high. Actually hugely remeniscent of my infamous gold stilettos that I adore so much.&nbsp;Certainly filling the strappy requirement.&nbsp;Unfortunately, likely something I wouldn't be overly amped on wearing again unless all my other shoes in colors cooler&nbsp;than platinum were...in the dirty clothes pile?<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.chineselaundry.com/img/shoes/BWED11AGESIL_L.jpg"" /><br />Jennie and Jill voted B. Danne and my sister voted A. Jen will vote A, no need to wait til she gets back from TRINIDAD to ask her. I'm torn.<br /><br />Keeping in mind the fact that&nbsp;our bridesmaid dresses are tea-length so our feet will absolutely be seen...ready, set, vote! (please?)<br />"

"event","I took a shower last night, which I usually never do because I am a morning shower person, particularly on weekdays (after I run at night, I don't wash my hair, I just rinse, because, you know, it's bad to over-wash your hair, or whatever). But last night, I thought it would be a good idea because I could sleep later.

And then when I woke up I was so confused that I got up to pee, got in the shower, and stood under the water for 5 minutes doing nothing until the water woke me up enough to reiterate the fact that I had to pee, and then I was all, 'why the fuck am I in the shower? Again?' But by then there was no turning back, mostly because the shower was hot and I was cold and did not want to get out.

So, I'm very clean. But going to be late. Oh well.

It also didn't help that I put the coffee in the coffee maker and turned it on...but never put in any water.

(took me less than a minute to figure that one out, but for a good few seconds it was dangerously nearing mental-breakdown mode as I thought my coffee maker had died)

Today's going to be good."

Because I write some really entertaining things and you know you want to read them ;)

So comment if you want to be added, and you will be. I just got over the whole having no idea who was reading up on my life thing and decided to lock entries."

I've been kind of away from it and really focused on just playing because it's stuff that's out of my control. And it's still out of my control.

"event","1)I can't figure out what's the strangest part: The fact that the girl I've called my best friend for the past 8 years is definitely not, or the fact that I'm pretty sure I couldn't care less about that realization. I just wonder what the hell was going through my head for so long.

2)Went out with Jennie and Cailin tonight and I love those girls more than life and want to take them with me to Manhattan. But I can't, and that's okay. And I was toasted (with all, count 'em, ALL of our FREE drinks at the bar) as 'the one about to be cooler than the rest of us put together' and I liked it, until Cai and I had a little chat by the harbor about Jennie and both walked away from it entirely confused...she's got everything going for her right now (we're talking some crazy-ass-good internship offer in D.C. and a just-drafted-by-the NHL boyfriend) and we're pretty sure she's about to throw it all away - except we're not sure if we're just THINKING she's throwing it all away, because she's about to go the path we, personally, wouldn't...argh...too hard...

3)Bobby asked me today if I think it would be stupid if we were to start dating (as in officially dating) now, and I said yes. And then he asked me if I thought it was stupid that we WEREN'T dating, and I also said yes. And then he asked me what we were supposed to do with that information, and I said 'nothing. Absolutely nothing.' And he said 'that's what I figured.' And that made me sad because I wanted to tell him how much I really like him, but I didn't because it seems so pointless. And we've known eachother for about 37 seconds, so it all seems extra stupid.

I didn't even strike out swinging tonight - totally looking at all three of those, and that's the worst way to go down. Ugh."

And now I'm off to buy a footstool. Because in my new apartment in my other favorite city in the world, I'm not tall enough to reach the shelves or cabinet at the top of my closet. It's a tall person's apartment. 

I should probably also buy a fan...other favorite city in the world = at least 10 degrees hotter than favorite city in the world for the month of August...hot, yo.

Randomly tuned into Regis and Kelly this morning and had some Matt Damon with my coffee. I have never, EVER preferred Ben Affleck to him, I would just like to say. For no apparent reason.

"event","So, after much (apparently too much, I guess) buildup from pretty much everyone I know, I finally tried a famed Krispy Kreme doughnut, and well...
That was it?
I guess I'm just not a doughnut person. I mean, it was fresh and warm (which led me to wonder about people who buy like a dozen, because obviously they don't stay warm, and so then I can only imagine them tasting like any other glazed doughnut in a box, and in which case, what's the superiority other than they're smaller so you probably eat more of them?) and I guess that was nice, but...yeah. Doughnut. I just got a regular little glazed one - was I supposed to get one of the ones with sprinkles or chocolate or something?
I was kinda bummed cause I passed up ice cream in its favor. Oh well.

But, hey. It's true.
In between applying for jobs with Random House and ABC and a bunch of other places that will never call me back, occasionally showing up to cocktail on the Nantucket trips, and getting calls from places offering me what may or may not be telemarketing jobs with fancy names, I've had about 16 nervous breakdowns and begun just living in denial and having a Cape Cod vacation.
Yesterday: Went swimming and ate chicken salad-with-apples-and-grapes sandwiches all day, ""cocktailed"" (read: talked to Bobby for 2 hours because the first crossing was empty), went to Emily's cottage, watched some recaps of the Sox playing Little League...oh, I mean 'Major League Baseball,' got wasted, drunk-dialed, nervous breakdown-ed, recovered from nervous breakdown (thanks Rowan!), went to some other cottage, which was more like a palace on 6A, that belonged to some boys with an adorable chocolate lab named Bledsoe and a lot of illegal drugs, took VODKA shots (ouch...), went back to Em's, ate guacamole, passed out.
Today: Recovery via Gatorade and sun. Slept on the beach for a while. Bought salad, forgot to eat it, bought ice cream, remembered to eat that, came home, talked to Jen about how there is a clear and present danger of us becoming telemarketers with fancy names, then came online to lovely Howie Day icons (thanks again, Rowan :)! )
Tonight: Babysitting my cousin Kerry. We're seeing ""A Cinderella Story"", swimming in her pool, then getting ice cream (so...it's possible I'm about to go an entire day eating ONLY ice cream) and watching baseball highlights.

So if that means editing documents in a law office is it for a while...well, it's closer to journalism than teaching sailing is, I suppose.
But I still want a newspaper job. Someone give me a job. Come on. I'm young and trainable and you can pay me shit!

Went on my weekly Manchester trip yesterday. Jen and I may have actually found an apartment in MANHATTAN that we can afford, AND we saw pictures! And I want it. And I want to go now.

Then we went to the mall, and because, even though I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not, I'm determined to show Brian that he's an idiotface and he's going to realize what he missed once I'm gone after this week...I bought a tiny skirt. And it's really tiny. With a ruffle. And then I bought the coolest shirt EVER. And then I bought a t-shirt at American Eagle for $4.86. And I'm going to be the hottest thing ever this week and then NOT say goodbye. Because I'm being a stubborn jealous brat and I don't care. The skirt is hot.

Then Jen's mom cooked us dinner, and then we went and got what was possibly the most amazing ice cream ever and I wanted to sneak into the Fisher Cats game, but it didn't really seem possible, but dammit I LOVE baseball. Last summer the goal (which was achieved) was 'get with a Cape league baseball player.' This summer? Jen's going for the Cats...I'll take the Nashua Pride. Mmm. Baseball players before they're millionaires and allowed to be out of shape and spit tobacco.

But speaking of millionaires...Sox game last night? Insanity. Absolute insanity. I love it. And I love that Barry Bonds is a fuckface. 

And if Johnny Damon and I ever got together...our kids would have the best skin tone and dimples EVER, thank you very much.

<P>Can't believe it's Thursday already. Last weekend was good - perfect weather. My mom made me run around buying stupid things like doilies and chafing dishes while Jen chased after me with a list, screening my phone calls and taking messages. Someone hire that girl as a personal assistant. The party eventually came and was good and I was drunk and got lots of money (not for being drunk...I can't write anymore, I've realized), and gorgeous Gabe came (just thought Kapler when I typed that, but no, gorgeous Gabe Kapler was <EM>not</EM> at my party, unfortunately) and so did Katie and her <EM>baby</EM> (ah!) and it was good to see them cause I hadn't in at least a year. My mom also developed a crush on my friend Tim, and that was weird. Big parties are difficult, I realized, because I was running around like an idiot trying to make sure I said something to everyone and I almost starved to death in the process. Finally I grabbed <A TITLE=""Click for more information about wine"" STYLE=""text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;"" HREF=""http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||wine|AA1VDw"">wine</A> and ccake (I didn't know if I wanted my sister's or mine...so I took both...) and got on a boat and left for a while with select individuals on a covert 'escape-the-party' mission, and that was the best part.</P>
<P>Also: Saw my brother's band play and they are rockstars, Emily and I gave eachother identical tiny Coach clutches (except hers is black and mine is sea-blue) and laughed about that for a while, had a slumber party at other Emily's, got back drowned-rat graduation pictures and they're funny, drank at a Chinese restaurant dive with Cailin (holla, youngin), and bought a little green (sometimes more turquoise, sometimes more green) skirt at the Gap, which, by the way, has an excellent line and sales right now. I would like to point out that I was wearing it and Jill told me I was the cutest girl in the world on Tuesday, the night the world fell apart courtesy of a boy who doesn't even matter (funny how that happens).

Seriously.

I was just innocently running down the street in this pretty little town, when, upon passing by a patch of woods, I heard this suspicious commotion.
I'm beginning to think I'm a very confrontational person when it comes to dangerous situations or something, because I totally stopped and walked closer and squinted into the trees. Then all these little field mice came scurrying out and ran across the street to the woods on the other side, and then I heard something bigger-sounding hiss or something and then go deeper into the woods, and then all of a sudden this PTERODACTYL struts out of the woods, stopping directly in front of me.

Um, yeah. I think I stopped breathing. Have I ever talked about the time I was running in the woods and saw a bear? Cause this was about 197,000 times scarier somehow. The thing was HUGE, like as big as two chickens, and it was all puffed up like feathers standing out pissed-off and it had TALONS.

So it starts to walk away and I'm standing there, NO CLUE what the hell I'm supposed to do, so I decide to attempt slow forward motion because, while I had somehow convinced myself I could outrun a bear, I didn't feel the same about the mutant turkey.

One step and the thing turned around and totally...noise-made...at me! I don't know what to call it. It was a scary noise. I almost DIED. 

Then a <A TITLE=""Click for more information about car"" STYLE=""text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;"" HREF=""http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||cars|AA1VDw"">car</A> came, and the driver stopped at first, probably in awe of the thing, and then figured out what was going on and sped up to scare it and it went back past me and into the woods and I ran to the other side of the street and was then consoled by the little old man driver until I informed him that I would feel better if I could hurry up and run a million miles away.

The thing ALMOST. ATE. ME.

I would like to say that I now may have a rational fear of flightless birds. Give me a bear any day.

In other news, Brian's voice now makes me die a little. He has the hottest voice EVER. God dammit. I think I managed to make him feel uncomfortable yesterday, which kicked ass until I remembered that when he gets nervous he looks like a little boy and makes me want to fix it. Hate. Him."

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Troy thoughts""> </P>
<P>Well, it was...good. Sometimes.</P>
<P>I would have preferred 'very loosely based' to 'inpsired by', personally. Not that I'm some huge <EM>Iliad</EM> purist (really, with the exception of Hector, I never really even remotely liked it - Greek myth doesn't do much for me) but it seems like the method was to take $200m or whatever, pull everything cool that ever happened in <EM>any</EM> Greek myth (hi! Trojan Horse!), give Brad Pitt a more golden tan than the statue of Apollo, and throw a few more pretty boys into skirts - insta-blockbuster! </P>
<P>Anyway...</P>
<P>Well, it was funny. Not sure if it was <EM>supposed</EM> to be funny, but I laughed every time someone pronounced ""Menelaus"" (who, by the way, I was pretty down with the idea of them killing. Didn't mind that, it worked.) Also, when Helen says, ""Last night was a mistake""...HAHAHAHAHAHA! Okay, sorry. I wasn't the only one, though. <EM>Last night was a mistake?</EM> Ouch. Burn. Poor pretty-in-maybe-not-a-Helen-of-Troy-but-oh-well way actress.&nbsp;She's already playing an empty character, did she <EM>have</EM> to be ditzy as all that? Also when Paris says, ""you think I'm a coward"" and hotguy in front of me goes, ""duh"". Heh. That was good.</P>
<P>Paris. Paris was appropriately disgusting. I hated him as much as I felt I should, which is good, considering I've always though of him as one of the most hate-able characters in history. I wanted to <EM>slap</EM> him when he was on the ground clinging to Hector's leg. <EM>Shut up Paris.</EM> Good <A TITLE=""Click for more information about job"" STYLE=""text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;"" HREF=""http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||job|AA1VDw"">job</A> on that one.</P>
<P>HECTOR! Yayayayayayayay! They didn't ruin Hector! I don't even know what to say. I love Hector. While we're at it, PRIAM! ODYSSEUS! Also yay.</P>
<P>Achilles was a big idiotface spoiled brat cocky bastard jerk. True to form, Achilles. Always hated Achilles almost as much as Paris.&nbsp;The fighting kicked ass. I was getting a little annoyed with the whole, ""He has a heart! He doesn't have a heart! He has a heart! He doesn't have a heart but it's <EM>okay</EM> because he gives a cool speech about how he. Just. Is.! Oh, wait, he has a heart! He loves Briseis!"" crap.</P>
<P>Hold up. Briseis. Hi, Briseis. <EM>Die</EM>. Hated her. Hated what they were trying to do with her character. If you wanted to make me believe Achilles wasn't a monster, well...okay, it wasn't going to work. But if you wanted me to believe in the humanity of his half-human side, the scene with Priam was great, and when he totally decked whats-his-face when he found out about Patroclus was very human. The crying over Hector's body pushed it. Anyway, back to Briseis. Ew. Also, <EM>she killed Agamemnon</EM>?! Come on, now. Like I said, not a purist, not a purist, really trying to swallow all the changes that come with being just ""inspired by"" but...hi? Clytemnestra? They really were banking on the assumption that most people haven't read this stuff and went to see the movie cause Orlando Bloom is in it. Which is probably actually the case, so on second thought, good assumption. But <EM>still.</EM>&nbsp; Briseis can't kill Agamemnon! I'm putting my foot down on that one. I'll respond to lectures on ""inspired by"" if need be.</P>
<P>Hm.Patroclus. A little whiny there, Patroclus. Sad, cause I always liked him. Was pretty apathetic about him in this, probably because he threw&nbsp;that&nbsp;tantrum on the boat&nbsp;and I stared with my mouth open for a few minutes and then chose to pretend he wasn't in the movie anymore because I was so annoyed.</P>
<P>Andromache was good, but when did Nan from <EM>Circle of Friends </EM>decide to go the path of starvation? Yikes. She's so pretty, she should really eat something. Oh, and hey, that baby had THE HUGEST HEAD EVER. Damn. </P>
<P>Hmmm...what else. I liked the music. </P>
<P>I was getting a little sick of listening to all the ""points"" they were trying to drive home. Yes, Agamemnon is power-hungry. Why don't we have someone reiterate that <EM>just one more time</EM> because we're trying to cover our asses because we made it seem from the beginning like the war is about Helen? Yes, Achilles wants fame and glory. Yes, yes, everyone who is a hero in this war will have his name go down in history forever...hey, wait? How did they know that then? I guess they just&nbsp;figured that somewhere down the road some guy named Homer would probably write an epic poem about them all that would eventually spin off into a loosely inspired summer almost-blockbuster?</P>
<P>Hm. This all sounds kind of negative. I didn't hate it. Didn't even feel like I wasted my money. <EM>Did</EM> get antsy because it was too long. Probably won't ever see it again. But I'd recommend it :)</P>
<P>Plus, I'm cranky because yesterday was <EM>not. Good.</EM> Explanation to come later, including how I ended up seeing ""Troy"" in the first place. Now, gotta get ready for work. Yuck.</P>"

So it was pretty much the nicest day EVER until about five minutes ago when all of these big, scary black clouds rolled in, bringing with them this wind that is currently tearing up flower beds and throwing them around the neighborhood.

It was eerily like how storms pop up on the ocean. I say eerily because THERE IS NO OCEAN HERE (have I mentioned that enough? Nashuasuckssucksucks, oceanless place)! So, clearly, this can't be normal and the world is probably ending.

So I'm going to eat non-pareils for lunch because they are so ridiculously good, just in case this is my last meal. 

Tomorrow: - Get. Job.
          - Attend family party in...uh...some South Shore town. Forget which. Better check on that. Dad's side, slightly less insane, but still. Grad party is next weekend...that is pushing the time on family, if you ask me.

Saturday: - Portsmouth (ocean! coast! thank god!) with Jen! Whee! 
          - Possibly movies. She won't see 'Troy' a second time, so it will probably be 'The Day After Tomorrow' (how fitting, what with the impending tornadoes outside my window - oh, wait, nevermind. It's a downpour. Sweet.) or the Red Sox movie. 
          - Manch townie bars. Ha! Yay.
          - Get job, which I most likely will not have succeeded in doing Friday.

Oh, I am rocking this being a college graduate thing if you ask me.

I need a new book.

Wishing I didn't have actual work to do at work tonight. Blah. Oh well. 

I was a half an hour late for work yesterday, actually, because I slept in, then ran and showered before driving up to Manch Vegas to play with Jen. In keeping with our location, we pulled out all the ghetto stops - lunch at Pizza Hut (wow...), browsing at the Salvation Army (there was this ridiculously cute bright pink terry-cloth track-jacket looking thing with white piping for $2, but for some reason it was like, extral LONG. Bummer.), and then driving around the 'hood. Heh. Love to hate Manchester. It was 3:45 before I remembered I was supposed to be in Nashua for 4. Professionalism, not working so much for me these days.

Memorial Day weekend kicked ass. I took pictures at Figawi that came out really good. Maybe one of these days I'll scan something with that scanner I like to use as a dust collecter.

Decided I wanted to quit drinking coffee and tried to convince myself that Gatorade would be just as good. Yeah, no. Caffeine and electrolytes? Not the same. I just may be falling off the wagon today. Who ever heard of death by coffee anyway?

I think it's a red linen skirt day. Of course, thay would require ironing. Maybe it's actually a jeans day."

"event","<P>Hello, and welcome to the longest day of my life. I couldn't deal with any of it, I don't think, but I made it! Whoo! And whew.</P>
<P>Um, where to start?</P>
<P>Oh, right, how about <STRONG>HE HAS A <EM>GIRLFRIEND? </EM>He. Has. A. Girlfriend? He has a fucking girlfriend!!!</STRONG></P>
<P>Sure. Fine. Right. Okay. Just one question...how the fuck EVER have <EM>I </EM>ended up the bad girl, the ""ridiculous"" (if I remember his statement correctly - which I do) one in this whole big stupid pointless situation? HOW? <STRONG>THERE ARE GIRLFRIENDS COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK LEFT AND RIGHT! </STRONG>These boys are terrible. </P>
<P>Why did no one tell me this? Where was Andrew on this one? What the hell is going on?</P>
<P>I am definitely NOT the bad one here. They can all go to hell.</P>
<P>Okay, moving on.</P>
<P>I graduated. GRADUATED.</P>
<P>I'm not in college anymore.</P>
<P>I'm...not in college anymore.</P>
<P>Um. Now what?</P>
<P>So I've been awake for like 20 hours or something because we all woke up insanely early for some reason and thought it would be a good idea to watch ""Miracle"" and then listen to UNH hockey songs on repeat to pump us up for packing. And so that worked, until Sam started crying. And then Jen.</P>
<P>I'm the tough one.</P>
<P>And then we packed up our apartment and moved out and Jen left and Sam FLUSHED THE FISH and then things started happening really fast and everyone was trying to say goodbye to me at the same time and then I ran into my ex-room to make sure nothing was left behind and looked at the spot on the wall that I used oil paint to patch one time and couldn't deal with that somehow and suddenly burst into a flood of tears that didn't stop until I had driven all the way to Nashua. Oops. It was entertaining at least - it was the laughing cry, because I had to laugh at all of my friends apparent shock and awe at my sudden emotional-ness. It was harder to explain to&nbsp;the boys&nbsp;that the whole trying to comfort and hug me thing only made it worse - I definitely did not want to be touched then, but hey. People as a whole are kind of the other way around, apparently.</P>
<P>I used to live in the best apartment on the planet :( And I don't now. I used to be a college student. And now I'm a fucking...alum. Ew.</P>
<P>And during my cry-fest in the car I managed to empty an ENTIRE iced coffee onto the floor of the backseat. ENTIRE as in I didn't get a SINGLE sip.</P>
<P>Can someone explain to me how I ended up talking to JEFF while retarded drunk of my ass five hours before I graduated? Jeff. Jeff is supposed to be GONE FROM MY LIFE.</P>
<P>I'm way too much of an idiot to be graduated. </P>
<P>And there's probably a really good chance that if I were ever to get married it should have been to Greg, and so there's probably also a really good chance I'm never getting married.</P>
<P>When Jon hugged me goodbye he said 'good luck in New York' and I heard 'you're never going to New York, you'll never do it' and then I was angry crying.</P>
<P>Jen called me 45 minutes after she left for Manchester and we cried on the phone for an hour.</P>
<P>I'm never going to live with Sam again. How am I never going to live with Sam again?</P>
<P>What the hell happened to Laura in like the last five minutes of the world? Actually, what the hell happened to the world in the past 2 days, cause I feel kind of...between. Floaty? LIKE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL, AND WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!</P>
<P>I just remembered&nbsp;I hate exclamation points.</P>
<P>I'm not in college anymore. Holy shit.</P>
<P>Somehow I rocked my job hardcore tonight despite all this. Maybe I just need to be going in seventeen different directions to get things done. But I hated everything about being there because all I wanted to do was wear Jen's cross country sweatpants that she gave me today&nbsp;because I love them (which led to added tears) and hide in my bed and watch baseball and get more iced coffee and cry ALL DAY AND NIGHT.</P>
<P>Why am I not more ANGRY that he has a girlffriend? Why am I disappointed? Why am I doing that retarded thing where you make excuses for someone's dick behavior because if you take away the dick-ness he might be perfect for you? Why does the one who coaches little kids and likes to hike and play sports and be CPR-certified have a girlfriend that isn't me? AND WHY THE HELL DID <STRONG>THAT</STRONG> JUST TYPE ITSELF OUT OF MY KEYBOARD?</P>
<P>Oh, god.</P>
<P>This is the most disorganized thing I've ever written. </P>
<P>I have to go to bed. When I wake up I hope I'm a sophomore and a business major.</P>"

<P>Don't puke. Or yell. Not how it sounds.</P>
<P>I was actually <EM>thinking</EM>, and I don't mean thinking about doing naughty things to him or making him my cute boyfriend or any of that...it kind of elevated to the point of thinking about people in general, and then life and then destiny and how it's all kind of a one-shot deal, the lot of it.</P>
<P>I want Brian to be in my life. And right now he only is kinda of...by default. And that sucks, because it doesn't matter, and so in 2 months the way it will most likely be will be that we don't speak and will never see eachother again.</P>
<P>And I <EM>like</EM> him. And by like him, I'm not talking want him. I like his personality, I like who he seems to be, I like the same things he likes, and just looking at that stupidly generic list seems like cause enough for me to want him to be my friend. Which I do. But...so? Now what?</P>
<P>See, so that got me going, and I started thinking about all the times in&nbsp; life where&nbsp;you meet people and it's one of those instances where you're just like, 'wow', for a second and all alive and it's perfect and you're so happy to have met this person, because really, it's people that make your life, and then...they're gone. How many times do people just let other amazing people walk out of their lives?</P>
<P>And how much are they supposed to do about it?</P>
<P>I guess I believe in fate to a certain extent. I do believe that everything happens for a reason, if only because I always want some justification for everything. So I don't believe that we control our own destiny; however, I do believe that we control our <EM>lives</EM>, meaning those day-to-day things we're living or pretending to live every time we wake up. Maybe in the end we have no say, but if we go through every day just <EM>waiting</EM> for life to happen, isn't that more existing than actually living?</P>
<P>Because that's my biggest fear in the world, existing rather than living. Bigger than the failure one.</P>
<P>Life's not fair, though, of course, so even though I can sit here and be all matter-of-fact and 'I want him in my life,' I can't just <EM>put </EM>him there. I can't make him want the same thing, and I can't ask him if he does because that's scary. But does he? Yeah, I'd never know <EM>unless</EM> I asked, because who talks about these things?</P>
<P>And does it even make sense?</P>
<P>I really hate the idea of all life being is a big hunt for people you want to fuck. I hate the idea that making friends is impossible and having sex is all there is, so it's like...fuck and one day maybe you'll fall in love with one of them, or you're pretty much screwed.</P>
<P>Why can't we just hang out and have fun like we did when we first met? Oh, right. Because that was like...courtship, or something ridiculous. Hanging out to get to the kissing, and now it's over.</P>
<P>And why am I so caught up on <EM>him</EM> about this anyway? Really, would <EM>I</EM> have even bothered getting to know him enough to care about this if I hadn't been attracted to him in the first place? How come I'm not hell-bent on keeping in my life and getting to know that guy whose name I forget who always holds the door for me? For all I know he could be amazing. See, this is disgusting.</P>
<P>But we could sail, and watch the Red Sox, and <EM>laugh</EM> and all that&nbsp;crap we used to do, and...I don't know. I want to know him. Not '<EM>know him-oh-im-so-emo-no-one-gets-me</EM>' crap. I just mean...I don't even know what I mean. I certainly can't write it very coherently.</P>
<P>But I want him here. And he's not going to be, and I'm not going to do anything about it,&nbsp;and so I'm existing.</P>"

<P>Got stood up by Cath, too, so no tacky movie. She went to a barbecue with some of her friends, and she invited me, and I went for a little while but it was very high school and not fun for me and these little boys hit on me and I wasn't&nbsp;about that and so I played camera girl for some people for a little while and then left and drove around until I remembered that aimless driving is a tendency of psychotics, so I scared myself and went and bought a salad and took it to the river and was cold again. And I bought Diet&nbsp;Coke with lime because I really like the bottle and stare at it every time I'm in a store, and so I had to, but&nbsp;then I remembered as it was burning its way down my throat that I hate soda, so I threw it away and was thirsty.</P>
<P>Bought&nbsp;Cosmo too, and came home and read it and it was a boring one and I passed out&nbsp;on my bed, so now it's 12:24 and I just got Emily's&nbsp;missed call that says she's in Hollis and heading to Manchester. Well, she was heading around&nbsp;10. Dammit. Bored bored bored.</P>
<P>Also, when I came home the people&nbsp;across the street were setting off fireworks and someone was playing guitar and singing 'Eleanor Rigby' and there was a bonfire and I was like, who the hell are<EM> they</EM>,&nbsp;&nbsp;cause I'm 157% positive it's a family with three little kids that lives there, but, whatever. I didn't check, but I was jealous.</P>

"event","<P>I'm here. Not at UNH like I had originally planned, or in Boston like I actually wanted. Kind of annoyed but getting over it. Jen is being weirder than I've ever known her and it's kind of disconcerting but I'm letting it go and just distancing myself from it, because after my own little freak-out the other night, I'm more than willing to believe that she's just having her own mental breakdown of sorts and just more annoying about it than I expected. She's just so damn flighty and forgetful and <EM>weird</EM>. But I love her.</P>
<P>Still, she kinda ruined my weekend.</P>
<P>Recap:</P>
<P>(Thursday night)</P>
<P>J: So you're coming up on Saturday, right? Meg wants to go to Asia, it will be fun - Scorpion bowls!</P>
<P>K: Well, I was thinking about going to Boston to visit Danne, since I haven't been in forever, but...yeah, I can come.</P>
<P>J: Please come! I need you to teach me to make orange juice! And we have to see the Olsen twins movie! Please?</P>
<P>K: (laughing) Okay, yeah! I'm coming. </P>
<P>Blah, blah, whatever. See? Her idea. Told Danne I wasn't coming. Danne, in turn, went to Nantucket.</P>
<P>(This morning)</P>
<P>K: Hey, so I'm gonna leave in like an hour - will you be in around 1:30?</P>
<P>J: Yeah. But, um. What are you doing next weekend?</P>
<P>K: Huh? Probably going to Boston.</P>
<P>J: Can you come here next weekend instead?</P>
<P>K: ...</P>
<P>J: Well, I have to write my last paper, and then my parents are coming up to take me and Jess to dinner, and Sam and Laura have fundraising, so you will be alone. Oh man, I feel wicked bad.</P>
<P>K: ...okay. Yeah,&nbsp;I guess I won't come then.</P>
<P>J: I'm sorry! It's just, I'd feel bad. Cause what would you do?</P>
<P>K: (*thinks* <EM>It's my COLLEGE. Where ALL my friends are, not just you. What the fuck?</EM>)</P>
<P>So. Weird. So I contemplated going up anyway, but since my main reason for going in the first place was because <EM>she</EM> wanted me to, I decided not to, kind of to prove a weird point or something. And then I told her I was going to Boston next weekend, and that I was going to go to Philadelphia over Memorial Day to visit Rosie instead of going to New Rochelle to stay with her and Corey and apartment/job hunt in the city, and that I'd see her the Thursday before graduation because I also said I'd work Mon-Wed the week I originally had off because, why not? Andrea is working that week and we decided on Friday we'd have lots of Nashua fun together before she leaves the internship. </P>
<P>I don't know. She seemed kind of surprised by all that, and was like, ""uh...that's like 13 days away!"" and I was like, yeah, well. I just don't know. I'm not putting my life on hold in case she wants to hang out, that's just dumb. And this morning was annoying, because I have ZERO plans (although I called Andrew when I found out I'd be sticking around here and he's taking me to lunch tomorrow).</P>
<P>Amused myself today by running in and out of the house hoping the cold sunshine would turn into warm sunshine (it didn't) and translating the first French&nbsp;part I hit in ""the Rules of Attraction"" (I need to stop reading 4 books at once),&nbsp;and then went to the mall and tried on lots of ridiculously short skirts that should NOT be as expensive as they are, got the biggest iced coffee in the world and talked to Jennie and Gabe while I took a freezing cold walk by the river. Cath's around now so we might go to a stupid movie (cause there are only stupid ones out). We're thinking 'Mean Girls', cause as irritated as I am with Jen, I can't go see the Olsens without her.</P>"

"event","<P>I had my first (last, hopefully? I don't know how many there are supposed to be...) 'I'm graduating from college in 2 weeks&nbsp;and have no idea what I'm doing with my life and am going to fail miserably and die in the streets and all my friends are going to be far away nononononononononono!' breakdown last night. Well, actually it was at 12:15 this morning. In the newsroom.</P>
<P>I think I was the most shocked of everyone, actually. They all apparently knew what was happening before I did.</P>
<P>I had the sunset dream again last night...okay, not last night, I mean last night before yesterday. Tuesday night. The fucking sunset dream, seriously. Jen googled it for me, and it means a desperate and futile attempt to hold onto something that's leaving, and impending doom or failure. </P>
<P>Great. Impending doom or failure.</P>
<P>I didn't find out that was what it meant until a little later in the day, so I was actually in a fantastic mood when I got up - which was at the crack of dawn, by the way. Drove up to UNH, handed in my LAST PAPER EVER, it was sunny, walked all around the pretty campus for like an hour and then went to my old apartment and woke up Jen and we made coffee and made fun of Evanescence and talked about my new psuedo-almost-kinda-but-not-really-punk-rock look&nbsp;and whether or not I'm turning into the Olsen twin with the awesome hair, and then Jen googled my dream, and that was depressing but we laughed about it cause we were together and it was okay.</P>
<P>Then Sam and Laura dragged it in, and they were both in great moods, but suddenly, for some reason, once we were all together, Jen got totally weird. All quiet and pessimistic and evasive, and ridiculously non-committal. We were trying to make plans for our last week, and she just kept being like, ""Oh yeah, that sounds good. I want to do that, I probably will, oh, well, I'll have to figure it out..."" huh? Because she has a new secret schedule that we don't know about or something that refuses to let her decide if she wants to go to the bars on Wednesday before Wednesday afternoon? And then we were talking about our last party, which we've all been planning since March or something, cause it's our LAST one in our PERFECT apartment at COLLEGE, and Laura said something like, ""How about Thursday?"" and Sam and I were like, yeah, sure, and then she looked at Jen and Jen looked all annoyed almost, and was like, ""Yeah, fine. I mean, I'll show up. I do live here."" WHAT? The stupid thing was HER idea originally!</P>
<P>Flaky. I kept thinking that, the whole time. Jen's turning flaky. I'm moving to New York with someone who's flaky?</P>
<P>Then she didn't come to lunch with us because she went to meet Nick instead. Cause, you know, we couldn't all go to the same place. But then again, other people probably would have&nbsp;interfered with him giving her 100% attention, because the way she leads him romantically because her own ""boyfriend"" is long distance is wicked. Wicked. Cool.</P>
<P>I hate being like this.</P>
<P>But then when I went to leave, she was like, ""No! Can't you stay? Skip work! It's Cinqo de Mayo! Come up on Saturday, promise?""</P>
<P>Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!</P>
<P>Sorry, getting long. Here's the rest:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""that night""> </P>
<P>Work should have been fine. It really should have. I was so focused - more focused then I think I've been in months. I didn't watch the Sox game, I didn't even <EM>notice</EM> Brian until after the paper went to press, and I was just completely into designing my pages.</P>
<P>So when they turned out less than the quality I had envisioned for them in my head, I got really, really pissed at myself. Internally. Externally I was just quiet, and said thank you and tried not to blush too much when Andrew came over and fixed everything and finished it for me cause we were on deadline. Then he went over it all with me and he was so <EM>nice</EM> but not sweet, so he was still teasing me a little and that kept it normal enough that I didn't <EM>completely</EM> want to die of shame, and I sat there and wished really hard that I could just have a crush on him, but I don't, and so then I got mad that I can't pick who I like, even though I obviously know that's not how it works.</P>
<P>We're waiting for the paper to print, and I signed off my pages and was seriously furious, but I didn't think it was obvious. And then Andrew says, ""You know...you probably...shouldn't be being so hard on yourself right now. This is about <EM>learning</EM>, you know, it's okay.""</P>
<P>So says the 23-year-old to the 22-year-old.</P>
<P>I know it's about learning. And I know that when anyone who isn't a page designer picks up the newspaper this morning, he or she isn't going to notice a single one of the things that I know were wrong with my pages. But I <EM>do</EM> know, and I also know that in a week and a half I'm not an intern anymore, I'm staff - and I know that should make me feel competent, but it makes me feel nervous as all hell, because when I'm being paid for real&nbsp;I don't want other people to have to fix things for me! I said that, and Andrew looked at me like I was crazy and asked if I really thought anyone minded helping eachother out, and for some reason I was suddenly ready to cry!</P>
<P>So I flipped out, because flipping out meant not crying, and I started ranting about my irrational and childish aversion to doing things I'm not good at, and if I'm not good at editing and page design, which I had kind of obviously been banking on, then I really <EM>don't</EM> know what I'm going to do with my life. And it seems like the <EM>older</EM> you get, the more people tell you you ""don't have to decide right now."" </P>
<P>You know what? I think that's crap. I really do. I don't <EM>knock</EM> people for not having a clue, and I don't judge people, and if someone lives an entire life clueless but happy and a good person, I think that's great. But don't tell me I don't have to decide ""yet."" I'm 22 years old. That's almost a quarter life! If I plan on deciding, I actually think that, now that I have a nice $13,000 of student loan debt and my parents and I financed another $107, 000 or something insane over the past 4 years, now would be an <EM>excellent </EM>time to start thinking about it.</P>
<P>And I. Am. Clueless.</P>
<P>And I'm dreaming about fucking sunsets of doom and suddenly don't have the ability I was always so proud of, the one that let me let go of things easily, and I found out yesterday that my stupid college is going all psycho-lockdown on the reading days and so we can't practice and that means that I NEVER GET TO SAIL AT UNH AGAIN, and the last time I did I hadn't known it would be the last, and Jen's being weird, I got a PARKING TICKET because UNH has decided that my permit is invalid <EM>now</EM>, what with 2 whole fucking weeks left, I slipped getting out of the shower and twisted my ankle and it's pretty bad but I'm walking around on it anyway cause I have to but I can't run, so obviously I'm going to get <EM>fat</EM>, I can't even decided how I want to pin my stupid ugly graduation cap, Brian makes me miss Greg and I hate him for it, but I didn't hate him at all when he came in mid-way through my rant about all <EM>this</EM> wearing the t-shirt he had on under his polo shirt and slightly sweaty and holding a basketball and looked like he wanted to say something but didn't and just kept looking, and so that made me hate him <EM>more</EM> because I didn't.</P>
<P>And in 7 weeks I'm done at this job and with this city, and my biggest fear is that in 9 I'll be on Cape Cod.</P>
<P>So. Kinda surprised the hell out of myself with the outburst. And I want to marry all of my co-workers because they are the best people on earth and totally joked about it with me instead of trying to make it something, and then later on when everyone was getting the papers from the press, Andrew gave me a ""pep talk"", as he put it, and managed to make it sound like he meant it when he told me I was smart and quick and going to be a great editor, as opposed to like he was saying it because he felt like he had to.</P>
<P>Which made me want to cry more. But I didn't, not even when I was driving home and sad songs were on the radio.</P>
<P>And it's supposed to rain this weekend.</P>"

"event","Last night I had a dream I was chasing sunsets. Sounds kind of romantic and cliche, I know, but it wasn't - it was scary. I had a camera and I was literally running to try to get close enough to take a photograph and I missed it every time...it was like I'd see just a swatch of it through a window or door and then start running as fast as I could, but there were stairs and windy roads and people in the way, and every time I raised the camera the sun went down and it was night. I didn't like it at all.

Work was pretty much terrible tonight. It started off okay, things to do, talking with Andrea and Andrew, my boss teasing me about Johnny Damon for some reason, but then around 10, all of a sudden everyone was gone except, oh, certain key players, and I was the only girl and the boys were being boys' boys, and Brian and I had a stupid encounter when he was coming out of a door and I was going through it and we stared at eachother and then he looked down and walked past me as fast as he could. And then Andrew called Pete over to talk, and Pete was totally shady and basically kept glancing at me out of the corner of his eye and totally blew Andrew off and bailed. Great. Now I'm ruining everyone else's whatever!
And then Andrew and Brian were talking, and Brian kept coming over and he never does that and every time he did I'd forget to breathe and it was stupid, but anyway, they were talking and suddenly I hear, quite clearly, being only about 3 feet away, ""yeah, well she's kind of ridiculous,"" and Andrew, love the little brat-with-the-heart-of-gold, but the look on his face gave it all away who ""she"" was even though he tried to cover it up afterwards by relaying an abridged version of the entire conversation to me.
I'm kind of ridiculous? 
I was finally getting excited about staying, too.
And now I never want to be there, ever."

<P><STRONG>1. We Built This City ... Starship </STRONG>(people don't like this song?)<BR>2. Achy Breaky Heart ... Billy Ray Cyrus<BR><STRONG>3. Everybody Have Fun Tonight ... Wang Chung</STRONG> (hehe, too funny not to like)<BR>4. Rollin' ... Limp Bizkit<BR><B>5. Ice Ice Baby ... Vanilla Ice</B> (I actually didn't like this song when it was cool to, but a couple of summers ago my friend Meghan made me a mix cd titled 'Hollllllaaaaaaa' and it had all random, bad songs and was the funniest thing ever, and this was on it, so I like it now.)<BR><STRONG>6. The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll ... Huey Lewis and the News </STRONG>(This one reminds me of my friend Melaine, who was my coolest friend in high school cause she was from New York and had a brother who looked like Matt Damon. She was also just wicked cool anyway. And she liked this song.)<BR>7. Don't Worry, Be Happy ... Bobby McFerrin <BR>8. Party All the Time ... Eddie Murphy <BR>9. American Life ... Madonna (I guess I just like old school Madonna)<BR>10. Ebony and Ivory ... Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder (Blahhhhhhhh. I wish I could say I liked it just because Paul sings it, but, hey. Even geniuses have their moments of talentless-ness.)<BR>11. Invisible ... Clay Aiken (I believe this took the role of 'ultimate scary stalker song' away from the Police. Though 'Every Breath You Take' is an actual good song, at least.)<BR><STRONG>12. Kokomo ... The Beach Boys </STRONG>(Are you fucking kidding me? 'Kokomo?' Who the hell are these Blender people? KOKOMO!&nbsp;I knew all the words to this song in first grade. I mean, still do, but...yeah.)<BR>13. Illegal Alien ... Genesis (Oooh Phil Collins is so scary, Phil Collins is so scary!)<BR>14. From a Distance ... Bette Midler (Heh. The ultimate in talent-show song, along with 'Hero' by Mariah and 'The Greatest Love of All' by Whitney. Shut up, Divas. Although I'll admit I cry at 'Beaches', Bette. I'll admit it.)<BR>15. I'll Be There for You ... The Rembrandts <BR>16. What's Up? ... 4 Non Blondes (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhnoooooooooo!)<BR>17. Pumps and a Bump ... Hammer<BR><STRONG>18. You're the Inspiration ... Chicago </STRONG>(Dude. I didn't know Chicago sang this. Am I thinking of the right song? Well. I like the 'You're the Insporation' ultimate 80's love-cheese one that I know, and I like Chicago, so, if not...I probably still like it.<BR><B>19. Broken Wings ... Mr. Mister</B><BR>20. Dancing on the Ceiling ... Lionel Richie <BR>21. Two Princes ... Spin Doctors<BR>22. Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American) ... Toby Keith <BR><B>23. Sunglasses at Night ... Corey Hart</B><BR>24. Superman ... Five for Fighting (This guy sounds like a great pianist. Too bad his songs make me want to DIE in a bad way.)<BR>25. I'll Be Missing You ... Puff Daddy featuring Faith Evans and 112&nbsp;(yeah, what I said about the Police song being good? Does not carry over into this.)<BR><STRONG>26. The End ... The Doors </STRONG>(Okay. There are so many worse Doors songs. And I like the Doors, and I can admit it, so...obviously they wanted to put good bands on here to be edgy or controversial or something, but they messed up. Especially cause the song gives the impression that they wrote it in 4 minutes being like, 'let's make fun of ourselves and our fans by&nbsp;pretending to be deep when we're actually just filling a minute of space. Who won't be smart enough to get it?'&nbsp;Oops, Blender.)<BR><STRONG>27. The Final Countdown ... Europe</STRONG><BR><STRONG>28. Your Body Is a Wonderland ... John Mayer</STRONG> (I take it the editorial board was male and jealous that THEY didn't write this?&nbsp;;) )<BR>29. Breakfast at Tiffany's ... Deep Blue Something&nbsp; (My cousin Sarah was obsessed with this song back in 8th grade or whatever it was. The guy's voice drives me up a waull.)<BR>30. Greatest Love of All ... Whitney Houston (Ahhhhhhh! Hahahahaha. It made it. This song is terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Learning to loooooooooove yourself....*puke* *stab* *die*)<BR><STRONG>31. Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm ... Crash Test Dummies</STRONG><BR>32. Will 2K ... Will Smith <BR><STRONG>33. Barbie Girl ... Aqua </STRONG>(I just really kind of think it's funny when that guy says 'come on&nbsp;barbie let's go party' in a total scary rapist&nbsp;voice. And then she's like oh-oh-oh, or whatever. Heh.)&nbsp;<BR>34. Longer ... Dan Fogelberg <BR><B>35. Shiny Happy People ... R.E.M. </B><BR><STRONG>36. Make Em Say Uhh! ... Master P featuring Silkk, Fiend, Mia-X and Mystikal</STRONG> (Dance dance dance!)<BR>37. Rico Suave ... Gerardo<BR><STRONG>38. Cotton Eyed Joe ... Rednex</STRONG> (C'mon, it's like 'the Devil Went Down to Georgia. Get drunk. Dance on top of something. Good song for that.)<BR>39. She Bangs ... Ricky Martin <BR><STRONG>40. I Wanna Sex You Up ... Color Me Badd<BR>41. We Didn't Start the Fire ... Billy Joel </STRONG><BR>42. The Sounds of Silence ... Simon &amp; Garfunkel (Oh, thank you GOD. I almost hate his one as much as 'Bridge Over Troubled Water.' Almost. But then, I am the girl who only really likes 'Cecelia' as far as Simon &amp; Garfunkel are concerned. 'Hello Darkness my old friend....' oh, there I go puking again!)<BR>43. Follow Me ... Uncle Kracker (Die.)<BR>44. I'll Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That) ... Meat Loaf <BR><STRONG>45. Mesmerize ... Ja Rule featuring Ashanti</STRONG> (I think it's so funny that Ja Rule's 'singing' and 'rapping' consists of him going 'UH' a lot.)<BR><STRONG>46. Hangin' Tough ... New Kids on the Block</STRONG><BR>47. The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You ... Bryan Adams<BR><B>48. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da ... The Beatles </B>(Okay, as a self-described Beatles psychotic fangirl, even I'll say this one's slightly annoying after hearing it more than like, once in a month, but...in the top 50 worst? Nah. No way.)<BR>49. I'm Too Sexy ... Right Said Fred (it's a joke song, it's only meant to be funny.) <BR><STRONG>50. My Heart Will Go On ... Celine Dion </STRONG>(ShutupIloveTitanicIloveverythingaboutitincludingthis)<BR></P>"

"event","I'm here. I'll be here all night. I am being responsible and studious - and the fact that it's for the last time EVER (whoo!) is the only thing chaining me here right now on a SATURDAY NIGHT. Passed on visiting Mary in Boston and told Chris I couldn't crew for him on his beautiful J-24 tomorrow, both in the hopes that that would give me incentive to WRITE THIS GODDAM THING. Because if I'm up doing it Tuesday night and therefore wasted all those good plans for this weekend to procrastinate, I'll want to kick myself in the head repeatedly. So I'm gonna do it. Now. See.
Well, there's a slight problem...I mean, who can possibly concentrate when she holds in her hand a sheet of paper confirming the purchase and guaranteed 2-day delivery of 6 tickets to see Matt Nathanson, Howie Day and O.A.R. at her absolute favorite venue in her absolute favorite city in the world? 
Yeah that's right. My dream concert just became a reality, and I'd like to thank all of those beautiful boys for appreciating eachother's talent and company so much and making it happen. I'm so on the bus, Howie.
Also, can I just mention that Howie is playing a FULL set, and he's not even the headliner? And O.A.R. headling means 2 hours plus...this is going to be the Longest. Concert. Ever. 
Yay!
Oh, hey, tangent. Right, so back to my paper. Uhhh. 16 pages minimum, 20 max. So yeah, 16 pages. Which in college student terms, of course, means 8 pages, due to professors' obsession with the art of double-spacing (hey, no knocking it here, not tonight!). So. 8 pages. Seems so...few...and yet about 6 too many. *Sigh* Shit.
After killing the morning and early afternoon playing soccer with my dog and reading on a beach towel in my yard, I dragged it into the newsroom to get design books from Jocelin so that I might have some actual research for this piece. GuesswhowasthereitwasBrianandhelookedsooooosooooosooooocutegoddammit. He kept looking at me and I'd like to think it had something to do with the fact that I was wearing a relatively miniscule denim skirt that was ridiculously short to begin with as it came from Abercrombie, and that now borders on indecent because I decided I hated the hem and cut it off...but it also could have been that it's Saturday and I've never shown my face there on Saturdays. Who knows. I also failed to read his expression in time after Jocelin, chatting about my paper, mentioned something about how HotPete graduated from UNH too and then all slyly said that the two of us would be pretty together. I really almost gave myself whiplash turning around to see if Brian reacted, but his head was down and he was wearing a visor (oh he's so rich sailor-style. Beautiful...) so I can just pretend he was crushed and heartbroken by the comment. Idiotface #1.
Hm, that may have been another tangent, yeah? Oh and hey, that may be a blank word document.  
Going. Now.
Writing. Crap.
Last college paper ever!!!"

"event","Oooh, look, sun! And it's the actual warm kind...where the air temperature matches it, you know? An unlikely concept here in lovely NE.
*And Kim becomes much more scarce then she was all winter...*
Gottawritemylastpaperofcollegeevergottawritemylastpaperofcollegeever - right, later. The way I see it...the internship GAVE ME A JOB. There's no way I'm not getting an A.
Right?
HotPete was back to flirty last night. Idiotface. He told me he liked my sundress and I came extremely close to apologizing if it was any sort of 'nice distraction' in his life. Grrr. Second biggest idiotface I know right now.
Play outside!"

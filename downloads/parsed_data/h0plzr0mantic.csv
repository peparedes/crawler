"event","I've learned a lot today or maybe I've realized a lot. Like life is too short to spend too much time on the past. I've spent too much time reflecting on my past and I've been holding on to all the pain and emotions associated with all the memories. Looking back and analyzing how could anybody want to say goodbye to a friend after three years. I've realized holding onto all that pain and emotions is holding me back from being happy and living my life. I guess you have to hold on to those memories or emotions until you're strong enough to let go. Ive been holding on for so long that I think I didn't know how to let go or I didn't think I could. Now I know I can let go because everything I've been analyzing and looking back isn't something that is going to change. I didn't make that decision. Its not on me, its on him. So I don't have to spend my time looking back at what went wrong or why because he made that decision for me."

"event","Since his mother left him, he leaves as a defense mechanism. He leaves so he doesn't get hurt. He learned from his mom that he wasn't good enough, she didn't want him. If he repressed some bad memories or feelings and when hes hurt or has similar feelings, he resorts back to leaving. Or maybe I have this all wrong. Maybe its just he knows he can hurt me most by leaving. Or maybe because he knows how much it hurts to be left, he leaves first. Or its a combination of things."

"event","when i get really depressed, i shut down. lately thats what ive been doing. today was one of those unfortunate days, where i was reminded of how lonely i feel. im afraid of how long this will last. i feel like i dont have anybody to talk to. i avoid talking to my family most of the time, except my sister. i dont have friends to talk to. i dont share my feelings i guess because im scared. i dont feel like i have anybody to go to. 
i guess when i had jarret, i had somebody to talk to. i was happy most of the time. i dont know what it was maybe it was happiness or the fact that i was more social than i am now. i just felt more comfterable talking to my mom, him, etc. i miss that. its painful to think about it so i just shut down, dont want to talk about it. but then im alone and i miss going out or i miss talking to a friend. for once, i just want someone to stick around."

"event","dear jarret, 
its good to hear from you. did you get my long letter? :) i hope you liked it. well its been 4 weeks now and im glad its getting easier for you. i would really like to see you graduate but i dont think thats gonna happen. At least I'll be able to call you or talk to you on myspace soon. im not surprised the air force is changing because of the war. Hopefully when it comes time for you to be sent to Iraq, the war will be almost over or you wont be fighting. My family friend has been to Iraq but she did support the troops, not sure what she did. Is your tech school in TX too? It sucks you dont get to come out here after boot camp. Hopefully you'll be able to come home for Christmas or before. 
So I bought a support our troops car magnet awhile ago. Oh yeah your dad added me on myspace! i felt special. He asked if I heard from you and I was like no not yet. I sent him a message that I just got a letter from you today. So maybe I'll talk to him later tonight or tomorrow. Its been really hot this week. It was about 95 or 90 something. 80 inside the house. Im still running. Im getting ready for school. Danielle has already started. My school starts mid September. Well I think thats about it. Im trying to stay positive. So write me back! 

<3 Jen xoxo"

"event","dear jarret, 
i was so excited when i got your letter! when i woke up (around 1ish haha) it was outside my door! before i even got out of bed i was hoping my sister brought it back cause i heard her get the mail then come back down the hall..and then i needed scissors to open it haha It made my day. 
After you left, and I closed the door, I cried...before you brought over the bear. Then when you knocked I looked out the peephole and I was like what...lol that made me feel better. Its still hard but these letters will get me through the next month. 
I cant really imagine how hard its been for you. I've only seen movies of boot camp. You must have more energy now because of all the wieght you lost and training. I bet you look sexy lol. Do you have a six pack yet? 10 pounds in 2 weeks? damn, theyre working you hard. You'll gain it back in muscle eventually. It just seems unreal. Theyre pushing you so hard because they want to see if you can be a good soldier. You have to be fast, mentally tough and strong. Theyre trying to desensitize you. I know you can do it though, youve gotta be the toughest guy I know. You'll get through it. 
I feel like I could talk to you for hours, if I had the chance. Its only been two weeks but weve never gone this long without talking. 4:30 am is pretty early. I cant imagine getting used to that. If somebody woke me up that early Id want to sock them. seriously. painful. lol and marching in the morning? are you kidding me? I could never do that. well I guess If I wanted it that bad. And 5 minutes with food...thats like stuffing it down your throat. What do they give 2 minutes or less in the shower? The humidity sounds like summer in Illinois. Its really humid in the summer but its prob worse in TX. 
Well today was the day Elvis died 30 years ago. So I woke up at 7 to see a special on Good Morning America with his Daughter. He died when she was 9. She was in Graceland which is his house in Memphis. Im a big fan...I bought this LIFE book with mostly pictures of Elvis and some biography and facts...on tues. He went into the army too. Anyway, I dont really watch the news. The weather has been about the same. Robin, a news reporter on abc (I think is her name) came back to the news this week after having breast cancer. 
I talked to Pat the other day, he was like its kinda boring not having Jarret here. lol I was like I know! You should get his letter soon. and Joe...who knows. We dont talk. He hasnt tried. I havent tried. but I sent him a message telling him to send you a letter. I got your address off of your Dads myspace in his blog. He posted a comment on your page telling everybody who wanted it, to go to his blog. :) 
Damn so do they stick ya real hard with the shot like they did in Pearl Harbor? lol Id be rubbing my bum and tearing up. Too bad I cant kiss your cute bum! 
Well, last week I saw Rush Hour 3, the day it came out. which was hilarious. Ive been hanging out with danielle, george and theyre friend Tay (Dontai?). Hes cool. Hes 28 and has two kids I think but he looks like hes 20. He goes to Ohlone with George and they work on music together. I guess he doesnt really smoke weed. If he does its a little. Danielle said George is trying to quit. Last week, he got on my nerves. So I gave myself space from him lol. But this week were cool. They come over to the house almost everyday or night but I dont always hang out with them. I did last week though because I didnt want to be alone. Tay calls me miss attitude. I guess I have some...but I didnt really notice. miss attitood. Dont worry, I like him as a friend. Yesterday, I spent two hours steaming this bananna and chocolate chip pudding...adding water ever 10 to 20 minutes. Omg it was to die for. The four of us ate that...plus my dad. I had the first bowl omg it smelt so good and I didnt have dinner so I had to wait till 9:30 to have some so lets just say it was a big serving. and then I had another...kinda small. there were no left overs. Id cook it again. 
Today, I went shopping with my grandma and Danielle for clothes for school. I got this new sexy jacket...youll have to see. Its hecka short but its meant to be small. and the collar sticks up, the sleeves go down to my elbow... and a new black purse. college material. then it was our last day seeing David before he goes to college ;; We had dinner at the cheesecake factory, the whole gang. Robert, David, Jake, danielle and me. Hella fun taking pictures at the table. jake
was taking some funny pictures of me...random. but thats him. and david and him were like zooming in and cracking up. well, hes coming back next weekend because it turns out hes older brother figure works at the airline down there so he gets unlimited flights out here for free. So that will be cool. 
And yes I told Danielle to write to you and I will keep telling her to until I see it. Shes had it rough with soccer practice. Shes lost 10 pounds and shes REALLY sore. Oh and I just ran for the first time last weekend after a month? I was so tired. But I had to cause I gained an inch in my waist from not running. plus my energy was low. I lost almost half an inch. So Ill keep running. This letter is really long so Ill leave some surprises. lol So be sure to keep this letter in front of you when your writing so you dont forget anything. I want to know if your coming back after boot camp. Oh and you have...about 12 comments since youve left myspace. and yes 4 are mine. 3 from aimee. and i see you and rosalyn made up. 

Write me back!!

dear jarret, 
how are you? what are you doing? i hella miss you. Last week was the hardest week. Today was probably the best day Ive had since...
The bear you bought me keeps me company in my bed. i cuddled with it the day you left & it was comforting. its not the same without you. i hate those terrorists for bombing on 9/11, if that didnt happen a lot of men wouldnt have to risk their lives. 
anyway, do you know when youre coming home? hope youre doing ok. if you need anything, let me know. id be happy to make you a care package! well i dont have much else to say except my arm is getting stronger. well, i cant wait to here from you! <3 :) 

PS you look so cute in the pics i took...more like you took of us. thats my pic on my myspace. :)

"event","so i told david that i liked him today at the party. i couldnt hold it in any longer. i got him alone and i told him. i was really nervous. i was like i have to tell you something..but its going to be hard to say so just bare with me. then i said i like you. and he said really? and i said ya. and i told him that i think we should hang out more. and he said ya we should. im just glad about how he responded. 
right now im over analyzing things because im not sure what he meant by we should hang out more. did he mean me and him or the whole group? i want to get to know him more because really me and him have never hung out alone..that i can remember. so this summer hopefully ill be able to drive over to where he lives and hang out."

but i miss my cousins. we had a fun time in disneyland and at the grad party before we left. when do i ever have that much fun? not enough...at the grad party, i actually danced well with some drinks in me and with the cousins and my sister. after that me and david decided to watch south park in danielle's room. so i put in a sp dvd and got on the bed and laid down. of course we were both on the bed. nothing happened. danielle came in a little later and we all were on the bed watching south park. the 3 amigos. a little after david had to leave so we said our goodbyes and i gave david a hug. i wanted him to pick me up when he hugged me so i made him hehe those are my favorite hugs.

depressed, anxious and sleepy...either sleeping too much or not enough.

i wrote this at 4am two nights ago. 

drug-free
its not about it being wrong. its about being thankful for what you have. when youre buying something you dont have to feel better, thats not being thankful. that youre alive. maybe youre not but thats no way to live. you should be high on life, not high on some drug. cuz soon it might fade away or lead to worse things. and it will. you'll come off the high and you'll be addicted to it and then youll want to buy more. not because you cant live without it. because you can. you did. its because it makes your life less boring. because you want it. in that instance, you are being selfish. 
its natural to be selfish. but when it comes to the point where you dont want to live without doing a drug or drugs its no longer about trying to feel better. its about wanting to feel better or high longer. it consumes your life. it becomes your life. maybe life isnt grand all the time. in fact it isnt. deal with it. life isnt fair. its not about feeling good about life. or feeling better. you dont have to take a drug. all it is is instant satisfaction. its not made to cure anything or to make your life better. 
i support taking marijuana for cancer. my grandma had to take marijuana pills to help her eat when she had breast cancer. without them she couldnt keep anything down with the chemotherapy. she had a life threatening disease. now dont give me bullshit about life not being fair. or comparing yourself to somebody who needs it. there are crack babies born everyday addicted to crack before they are born. because their mommy is addicted to a drug. life wasnt fair to that baby.
i guess im more ok with people smoking cigs than smoking weed or a more dangerous drug. theyre all harmful. its just being high on weed and being drunk are similar. thats why so many people get in accidents or doing something without their better judgement. it makes them stupid. 

i pretty much psychoanalyze everything. this is just a draft if i want to finish it.."

"event","i really dont know where my life is going..im single, dont know what i want to do for the rest of my life...i seriously dont think that there is a future here for me in fremont..just because theres nothing here...i've never had one boy ask me out & ive lived here my whole life. i've asked noone out because i like to get to know the person before i do or it hasnt been the right time for me, meaning i havnt spent enough time with the person to know. ive never had a boyfriend here or where ive gone to school..i've never gone to ohlone so i dont know whats out there. i might go to ohlone next year or i might continue at chabot another year. all i know is im transferring...after that.

my only boyfriend i've had lived in san diego..and i actually thought i would go to san diego state and then we'd get married...but it didnt work out. im ok with that but im just afraid that i'll be alone to the point where i cant stand it. then i get my heart broken or get hurt...i guess im just lonely and i dont think ill get a boyfriend soon because well i never have had one here..it just sometimes seems hopeless. 

im trying to just to be content with being single until i meet that person im supposed to be with. or if i have already met him, i'll just try to wait until the right time."

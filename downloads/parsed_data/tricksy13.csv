"event","So all in all I had a tremendously crappy weekend.  The only plus side is that I excersised a lot, hopefully that will make up for the excess calories.  I think my problem with bingeing is that when I try and incorporate new foods into my diet I end up going mental and eating everything in sight.  So I'm going to try just eating one type of food per day, like all veggies on one day , all soup on another, etc.. I'll see how it works!!!  Tomorow is another day!!"

"event","This is my first journal entry.  I'm hoping to enter the lose 2o lbs community because I could really stand to lose twenty pounds.  Next semester I'm starting an excersise management class and we always weigh each other and measure each other in class, and I might just die if people measure me now with my lard ass."

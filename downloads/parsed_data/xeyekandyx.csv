I spent $20 on them and Nick put in the rest of the money they were like $60. =P. But they look good! Then we ate out at Moxies in the mall. It was okay but the waiter was REALLY annoying.. lol someone was really trying to hard for his tip...well here's a TIP F*in LEAVE US ALONE WHILE WERE EATING. lol oh well I guess he was just doing his job but common, every 5 seconds he was their asking how everything was and the usual questions....how are things gonna get bad in 5 SECONDS! lol...Well after that..or before..yeah it was before. lol we went to see ""guess who"" with Ashton Kutchure..yeah I don't know how to spell his name nor do I care =). But it was okay except the movie was really drawn out, and Nick was beginning to get bored. hehe. So after we were going back to his house on the bus then he decided to stop off at the Market, well we got out and checked the Market and it was closed....it closed at 4:00 and it was 4:45. lol So we had to Walk back to his house and&nbsp;the new shoes were taking some getting used to. But we got candy so that made it worth it.&nbsp;*smiles* and we got to talk.&nbsp;We get back to his house and his parents were gone&nbsp;so we took advantage of that *wink**wink* ;) theeeeen&nbsp;porter came over and we hung out with him for a while then my parents came to get me at&nbsp;9:40,&nbsp;and I fell asleep in the car on the way home and Nick and Porter went to Bingo. lol</FONT></P>

We had a good time......Except I was sick....I had a really high fever...and his lil neice was there and&nbsp;I had left my water bottle&nbsp;,for my dry cough, downstairs and she got into it and drank some..I hope she&nbsp;doesn't get&nbsp;sick but she probably will and Nick as well. I've missed him so. =( We went to the mall and I bought him 2 dvd's for his B-day on monday since I won't be able to see him then. I made him a blueberry Cheese Cake and I took him out to eat. I finally got to see ""Nightmare before Christmas"" and&nbsp;""Fightclub"" since those were the ones I got him. They were pretty good although I missed a lot of the movies getting distracted by Nick ... ;) (not that I mind). Ugh I was so sick that I couldn't even stand the ride home....It felt like forever. I ended up falling asleep on the ride home, and&nbsp;in the bathtub when I got home,&nbsp;and woke up in it&nbsp;by me talking to myself in my sleep. haha I thought I was talking to Nick. silly. And Today I was suposed to go with Nick and his family to Sarnia for his lil bro's hockey game but it got cancelled because of the weather, and Nick had to work because of it, and I would have been far too sick to go anyway. Sick and all I had a good weekend =)</FONT></P>

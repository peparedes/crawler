I woke up at seven and fed baby. Then watched dawsons creek at nine. then slept for like 15 minutes til the phone rang. Talked to Rachel for a little while. Played with Brandon. Made lunch for him. He likes to feed me but he wont  let me feed him. So there was a big mess to clean up in his high chair. I gave him a bath and watched alittle bit of anywhere but here. (it was on HBO). Then Brandon started getting fussy so i put him down for a nap. My mom came home and ate something. And now i'm sitting here with NOTHING to do. We're going to take brandon to the water park later so i'd better go clean the house and get ready."

nah, i'm really excieted for her. Shes actually moving forward with her life unlike everyone else i know. Most of us never get out of here. 

I saw Shrek 2. It was so adorable. I actually think it is better than the first. (barely) even though they were  both good. Brandon threw up at the theater. I guess i shouln't take a 17 mnth old to a movie and feed him pop corn, reeses bites, and coke in two hrs. Oh well he still had fun..i think

I saw that Monster movie too. It was strange. I could have done without the whole lesbian sex sceene with the background music of crimson and clover though.   I can't beleive it was a true story. The first dude deserved it but the bitch didn't have to go spycho and kill everyone else.

My baby bwandon said the word ""baby"" today!!! *cheer*
I was all proud of him and crying and crap. Its actually very pathetic. But you know me. Pathetic little Sarah. 

And so ok. Whats stormy said on my voice mail didn't piss me off so much. What DID actually piss me off was the fact that she had people in her fucking family call and leave a message. That is so fucking immature and annoying. I wouldn't expect such childish bullshi behaivior from Stormy. But i guess i should from now on. She tries to act like shes my mother. I don't need that shit. Shes supposed to be my friend not my parent. And if she really knew me at all she wouldn't say and do what she did. I still care for her and all. But i think we need a break for awhile. We've been haging out way too much lately and she started driving me crazy but now i'm just plan annoyed with her. She acts like a little girl and has almost no common seince. We just don't relate to eachother much anymore. And it hurts. Shes been my freind forever. I dunno

ok if you don't know me well you have no clue what the hell i'm talking about. So you probably think i'm a lesbian having a fight with my girlfriend.

We had mexican food. It was sooooo good. Um.....oh lets see, oh yeah, brandon broke one of the eggs and we are still finding little peices of the shell on the floor heh.

<h2>You Have a <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/lesbianpussy.html"">Lesbian Pussy</a>!</h2>
It's not cock, but pussy that you like.<br>
No question about it, you're 100% dyke.<br>
To the outside world, you seem butch and tough.<br>
But truth be told, you'll melt for the right muff.

<h2>Your Tongue's Talent is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/rimming.html"">Rimming</a>!</h2>
You are wild and crazy, and not afraid to show it. You love seducing unexperienced partners into sharing your kinky taboo. 
<br><br>
Your strong, slimy tongue isn't afraid to go anywhere, and you dig into that ass deep! You're dirty, and you love it. 
<br><br>
But be careful, you're bound to lose friends over this naughty little fetish. Don't be so open, some people just can't handle all your kinkiness.
<br><br>
You'd be most compatible with a Pussy Licker. You both love exploring deep, dark places with your tongue, and would benefit from trading secrets.

life is good. I bought brandon a stuffed puppy and a stuffed lamb chop and a card that says ""my first valantine"" on it. LOL then tomorrow we are gonna go get our picture taken. I swear i'm such a silly mommy. :)
I wish it wouldda snowed more. I love it when its cold and snowy outside. I wish i live somewhere where it was winter all the time. 
I watched the exorcist three on tv. It was so fucking retarded. They had a scary movie thing on tv tonight. They played all the friday the 13th movies, nightmare on elm st. movies, and halloween movies, like they always do. But then at midnight the movies started to get gay. Some movie about godzilla is on right now. UM...NO. heh
My dad got my mom this really really pretty flower arrangement. It had red roses and white baby breaths and a big velvet heart in the middle. Its sitting on the kitchen counter so when she wakes up she'll see it. :)

Ok.....the doc put me on THREE different types of medication  and schedualed an app with some lady for me to ""share my feelings with""
sigh.
is there really something that wrong with me? I'm a mom, i'm supposed to have my shit together, not be seeing a shrink. I wish i didn't feel so uncomfortable with myself. I'm never good enough for anyone.
i always fail at everything i try to do. Maybe i just don't try hard enough. 
well..back to my exellent day"

"event","I feel sooo shitty. GRR sickness sux :(
but other than that i'm having a good day. I'm soooo fucking glad hes gone. YAY YAY YAY YAY
I think the only reason that i said that stuff in my last entry is because i DON""T feel sad that hes gone. I DON""T miss him. And i think i was just trying to convince myself that i did so i didn't feel guilty for not giving a shit. But someone made some really good points that i already knew about but just forgot to acknowledge when i wrote what i wrote. But honestly, i feel so much happier and so much more stressfree now that the dickhead has left. Its only tuesday but i already feel closer to my old self. Its great :)
I feel like doing something fun. I feel so refreshed. I'm gonna go buy brandon a vday pressant  :)

"event","well its really over this time. Hes gone. He went to midland and he isn't coming back. I know its for the best and i know we weren't right for eachother. But, still, i wish i could have done something to prevent this all from happening. (used my birth control) lol 
but seriously, its been almost three yrs with him. Hes all i've known. Hes all i had. I know i could have been more understanding of his needs and more patient with him. Everyone thinks that rodney is this horrible person. And he does have many many faults. but we all do. He has manny good things about him too. He is very creative and funny. And one thing i can honesty say is that rodney really does love me. He has always been honest with me. He may be a jerk but he always had reason to me. He did get alittle spycho at times but we all do. He was going thru so much. and i didn't care. I told him i would never leave him and i left when he needed me most. That makes me feel so terrible. I wish people would just stop hating him and think of him as areal person that i really did fall inlove wtih and understand our relationship alittle. And I know i shouldn't have told people when i was mad at him cuz now everyone hates him. I should have just kept my mouth shut and my opinions to myself and maybe we'd still be happy. Maybe brandon would still have a chance at a real family. I never wanted this for him. He deserves a father. He deserves so much more than i have given him. I love him so much that it hurts. I can't even immagine my life without my little punkn. But at the same time, i don't know if i can immagine my life without rodney. 
i thought i was over him but if i am why does this hurt so much. I cried for hours last night. I just look at brandon and i start tearing up. Its so hard to look at someone so beautiful and innocent that you created with someone who isn't gonna be part of the wonder you made together. I don't know if this makes any sence to anyone else. Its just a bunch of random thoughts in my head. 
I swear i tried soooo hard to make things work. I gave up my life. But now i still feel guilty. I neve went to see him. He was all alone in the apt for three months without a word from me. I feel such guilt for what i've put us all thru. I wish it would jsut go away. I wish i didn't feel sadness, empt, lonely, scared, confused, and hurt all the time. Theres so much rain in my life right now. Seems like everytime i think things are getting better something gets in the way. Something holds me back from being happy. From being the person i once was. I wish i could change it. Its the first time i can look myself in the mirror and say that i honestly regret something...
Not rodney, just the past. Just all I have done. I want to make it right, but i just don't know how"

I'm bored. I don't know why but for some reason my computer won't let me take quizes from quiz diva. Everytime i try my computer freezes. Its starting to piss me off cuz i get real close to finishing the quiz and all of the sudden it just freezes up. Piece of crap. HEH Well lets see here....School went ok i guess. Well as good as school can go. No one talked to me of coures exept to ask me if they could barrow a pen. LOL i'm used to that by now. Rodney was there when i came home. He looked really sad and felt bad for slapping me earlier. I wish i was strong enough to hate him or to be a complete bitch to him. But i can't. Even if i want to i can't bring myself to do hateful things to someone i once loved so much. I dunno, Rachel says i'm too nice. But its not me being nice, its just me being weak and still carring for him in some way. I guess i always will. Then mom and i got into an arguement cuz i wanted to go too wal-mart to get milk for brandon and she said it was too cold. I know its not the nicest day but fuck, its not like we live in New York or something where it snows. And besides that, brandon needs his milk regardless of the wheather outside. So finally i just got up and walked to HEB and got it myself. I guess its true, you can't count on anyone but yourself. :) but thats ok with me. As long as baby gets taken care of thats all that matters to me. 
welperz i guess i'm gonna go TRY to get some sleep. I haven't been able to sleep for shit lately. I have problems. I don't have a big sleeping problem but there is definately something wrong with me. I still have to make an app. with the doctor so he can see what it is.
One problem i've noticed i have, i'm horny all the time lol
and i'm obsessive. heh

"event","well i think i have finally figured out my problem. I think its that i have realized where i am and who i am in my life. I never thought i'd be this way a this time in my life. I know nobody ever expects it and i guess i'm too weak and its all just too difficult for me to deal with. I wish i could just accept my life for what it is and what it used to be and move on. But i can't get past the first step. I can't let go. I feel like if i get on with it then it would have all been for nothing. My life is a joke. Its a mistake. I feel as tho i have no one to relate to me because i am by far the worst person in the world and don't deserve a relationship with anyone. Its like i have smothered myself. But now that i can't breath i want someone to save me. But how can you save someone who doesn't believekk they deserve it. I haven't earned it. I'm sick of everyone. I can't stand to talk to anyone.  I don't have the energy to get out of bed. I don't have the strength to do anything productive. But, at the same time, i don't even have the desire to change. I like hating everyone. Its so much better than trying to get along when your really thinking about how  miserable you are inside. I'm just sick and tired. Plan and simple. I'm old. I'm trapt. And i don't know where to start pealing away the layers of my sadness to find some sort of peace. Thats all i truely want."

"event","i feel dead. I have good days and i have shitty days. But for the most part, everyday is empty. I don't accomplish any real task. I do nothing. I have done so manythings in my life that have hurt people and hurt myself. I caused so much bs that i can't see past the greyness of it all. There is nothing here fo me. I love brandon more than anything and he is the ONLY reason that i haven't lost it. He keeps me alive. I know that sounds cheezy but i can't make it any clearer. He is the reason i am here. I love him so much. I look at him and want to be all of the things he deserves. But i fear that i will never do him justice. I just want it all back. I want love. I want to be the most important person to someone (brandon excluded) i want to be the most beautiful person someone has ever seen. I want to be on someons mind all day everyday. I want to feel loved and give love again. I'm so lonely. I just feel like i will never be good enough for anyone to truely love me. I don't deserve love. I am going downhill. I can feel it. I am getting worse and worse. I'm going to the doctor to see whats wrong with me and see what he can do. I don't beleive in taking anti-depressence but nothing else has worked. I have to do something. I can't handle anything anymore. And when i say anything i mean anything. I can't handle breaking a glass while i'm doing the dishes. I'll just cry and cry over everything. I just need someone to hold me. And want ONLY me. And not just cuz i'm there or i'm ""good enough"" but because I'm the one that person wants. ME all of MEE my good and bad qualities. I want someone to look at me in that way. I just want a companion. I watn affection. I feel like crying and giving up everyday. But i won't becasue i have a beautiful sone to take care of and look at everyday. but i need to get better. I am just so different. I'm such an outcast. I'm looked at as if i have a desease or a problem. I just want it go go away. That or maybe I should go away.
well thats enough depressing shit for now. Good bye"

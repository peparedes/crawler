However a girl who was my best friend years and years ago and whom i spoke to once two years ago called me the other night its strange having to catch someone up on a part of my life they missed. anyway, thats not why i am writing in this journal. it is because I am so excited about going to Spain this summer. Last week I wasn't really planning on going, but now i want to so bad. i am so excited. i will be there from like july 1 until the 31. I will be going there with some other students from USD but we have to sign a contract saying that we won't speak english while we are over there. ahh, so intimidating! anyway i think there are like 15 other students from USD and then it is going to be open to students of other countries which means the only we will be able to talk to them is through spanish because they won't speak english they will speak like german, french, or russian. anyway that is enough for now."

"event","I just bought a blizzard but i am really uninterested in eating it. So I don't really update my journal too often and i don't really know why. i guess whenever i have something to say i just tell emily and amber. and yes, you read that right it says amber. i have been talking to her since her birthday. i really do miss her and i don't hate her or blame her for anything. one cannot control the way their heart feels and i know that now, i am just too stubborn to get over things. but anyway she comes home the 16th and we might go and get our hair done, but then i am also going to get my hair done with emily too. 

hmm well this semester is finally over. thank god that i made it through the semester. it's hard going to work and going to school so i respect everyone that does that. i am not going to miss any of my class however my spanish 211 class did get really fun towards the end. oh well, i am taking the second half next semester so it will be fun too. i got an email today regarding my study abroad in spain and they want to switch it to leaving in july rather than june and i am not so sure i am down with that. it means i will miss my birthday and then i will be gone for the very middle of my summer break. i also saw the names of the other people who were going and this one kid who i think is a pompous ass is going. he frustrates me. if i go i have to sign a honor contract saying i won't speak any english while i am in Vigo. crazy, i know.

well, thats enough for now, i must go read because i have to work at 7:45 tomorrow morning."

I didn't know what she was talking about so i took off my hoodie. the cigarette landed in my hood!!! and my hair was in the hood so i was so lucky my hair didn't catch fire. i have to throw my jacket out because it is all burnt now, but i still have my hair."

All week I shopped, a lot. we always went to the movies, went out to eat and bought a bunch of dvds to watch. saturday night we were watching a movie when bolten called because he and two of his friends were drunk so amanda and i and this guy steve had to go pick them up because we needed to drive their cars back to the base. i wasn't upset about it like amanda was. the only thing that worried me was that i had to drive a guy back that has grabbed my boob before so i was worried about his grabby hands. instead he just asked a lot of weird questions. so when we got back to the barracks we were all standing around wating for amanda to get back. i ended up going into steve's room and spending the rest of the night there. i left at 6:30 the next morning even though he said i could have stayed the night there but amanda might have been suspicous. we had such a great time. we drank wine which is disgusting and i will never drink again. and we watched a couple of movies. the first one we watched we just laughed the entire time and had no idea what was going on in it. man it was just so great. i ended up having a crush on him despite he is shorter than me. then the next night i hung out with matt for like an hour which was really great too, he was unusually funny. that was great to and he told me i looked good. but that was obviously sleep deprivation getting to him. so i said goodbye to him that night and i may never see him again which is sad, but its ok.  then i went to steve's room and hung out with his roommate since he wasn't there when finally i gave up waiting i ended up meeting him outside we talked for a bit and he invited me in but i declined so he gave me a hug which was nice. anyway then the next day i left and damn near missed my flight. so here i am today once again stressing out about my grades. but on the upside this is like my last week of school hopefully forever at ASU."

"event","so earlier today i thought i was having a pretty good day. i did my homework last night and was pleased with the outcomes. i went to class and my spanish brochure was awesome even though i found out it wasn't do today. then i came home and my sister had called me. i tried calling her back but i didn't get a hold of her so then i attempted to get the phone bill and electricity put into ambers name. then amber comes home to give me money and we started talking. i told her everything she has to do in order for me to get my name off the lease so it all seems well. then i exchanged a few stories with her. then we talked about the history test and thats when it happened. the most unbelievably stupid thing i could possibly do. not to mention the pain. i sat there laughing so hard i was crying and part of the tears were for pain. i sat there enduring it for a few minutes out of confusion on what to actually do and amber just kept laughing and trying to help me and everytime i asked what to do and attempted to fix the problem she would say what to do then plug her ears and turn around out of fear that i mean scream in pain she was even preparing to suggest going to the emergency room. so i assume you are wondering what happened? well haha this is embarrassing, while we were talking i was playing with my stapler and just like popping staples out and then i put my thumb over the holes and pressed down. now what happened was the staple went all the way into my thumb. not just a little bit. the prongs or what have you were all the way in my thumb. i don't remember how it happened i just remember looking at my thumb and seeing the staple and the showing amber. out biggest concern was whether or not the staple was pinched off or not in which case i would have gone to the emergency room. so i sat there trying to pull it out which wasn't easy at all. i would pull a little and stop, i about passed out. i could feel the metal moving inside my thumb. it was terrible and this is coming from a person who has piercing and has seen needles sticking out through parts of their body, but this hurt. by the time i got it pulled out my thumb was practically numb. my thumb still hurts now and it has two holes, basically i just pierced my thumb really. yeah not cool, anyway the end."

"event","so at work today magdiel asked me for a favor, my response ""i'm not pinning anything on you."" gah so i had to pin his damn name tag on his shirt for him never again will i do this. as i was doing it i felt something wet on my hand so i pulled away. i thought he was trying to bite when actually he was kissing my hand which he admitted to doing. GAH it makes me so mad why doesn't he get that i am not interested. he asks me to do stuff i say no. he asks for my number i say no. he asks if he can come over i say NO. what the hell is wrong with him does he actually think i am playing hard to get, ohh because i'm not if i wouldn't feel so guilty i would press sexual harassment charges on him."

"event","so kyle did call me back but...my phone was staticy so...i had to go. but i will totally call him back this weekend. i don't know exactly what to talk to him about but it will be nice talking to him since i havent really since this summer. anyway i was so bored today i called like ten people, one of course being kyle. i also called greg but couldn't get a hold of him. my whole family shunned me. other nameless folks were also short. and i really wanted to call matt but i deleted his phone number off my phone but if it had been there i would have called him."

"event","oh so many problems. not really but a few at one time. so i still want to drop out this semester but probably won't. my stomach has been hurting the past three days which really sucks. also i feel i need to put the problem with my friend B to rest. i have given her the chance to admit it and although i think she knows i know she still hasn't admitted it. this bothers me because its like a veil of dishonesty over our friendship, but i did give her the chance. so now it is at rest and i will no longer ponder it.

i deleted matt's phone number from my phone today, even though i really didn't want to. i wish he would just call but i know he won't. gah it sucks, so i figured that having his number was just like excess junk i'm not going to use so in the recycling bin it went. although i won't lie, i do have it saved on my computer still."

"event","yeah so i have failed to write in my journal all this week but it has been pretty hectic.so much has been going on. i have a guy chasing after me whom i would love to kick in the balls to get him off my back and then there is this strange need to call matt but i have been holding off on that, also it seems a second friend of mine has been living a lie. for those of you who don't know my former best friend had been living one for seven months so i tend to not trust people as well and notice more inconsistencies in stories.  So friend B as i shall call her has had this great relationship going on with her ""boyfriend"" for several months now. I never had the opportunity to meet him but she would tell me of all their outings and what not. well it was about a week or two ago when things started to be off he would tell me one thing and then later say something that would throw the previous statement into an inaccurate one. sorry if this isn't fluid but i am tired. anyway as it turns out due to my amazing detective work and a conversation with her sister i have come to find out that everything that happened during their time together was actually not true. this entire time the guy was a guy she met and talked to online. their ""outings"" were actually, i don't know detailed fantasies, i suppose about them being in the same place which isn't possible because they were online. so everything she told me was a lie. i don't know what to do? i mean i don't know why she would lie like this i mean she is my friend she should be honest with me. i do have compassion for her so its like gah i don't know what to do. should i say something or should i go on letting her live her fantasy but gosh that can't be healthy. i wonder if she is doing it to cover up for something else like maybe she is a lesbian and not ready to come out so created a fictional boyfriend to cover up. gah i just dont' know what to do, so if you have any ideas feel free to comment?"

Please to please you and shake the hand
That waits for me to leave, to stab me in the back
Good to see you and make you laugh
With the same mouth that calls the kettle black
And I want to say so many things
But three little words are all I need
To burn the bridge with no regrets to keep

I'm sorry to say that I hate you
and I never want to see you again
it's not a mistake that I met you
and it taught me everything

Here's to you two and your success
Congratulations on the perfect mess
Oh what to do but the best
You'll never be good enough just like the rest

I'd like to say that it was fun living under the gun
I'd like to say I like you but that wouldn't be true"

"event","yeah so it seems the font on my computer has increased by like three sizes, no idea why. i didn't go to class today because i wasn't feeling well, i can't miss anymore school.i did have to go to work today though. i sat at a computer and trained for the cashier for five hours on something that should take supposedly four hours. I was working on it for FIVE hours and only got about half way done. this guy who was also training said it took his friend 15 hours so i'm like well its free money to sit on my ass. so then i came home and had dinner. eh i had a tuna sandwich, yuck. but i also had apple sauce and pineapple tidbits. i added two more workouts to my workout regimen.yeah so i did five different exercises and tried another one but it is really hard on my already bad neck. but i turned my normal like half hour work out into an hour workout!! i was doing the exercises but i wasn't getting as much out of them as i could have until now. i do it more slowly and hold in place for one count. its great, i feel great. i have lost two more pounds. EMILY, YOU BETTER WORK OUT FOUR TIMES THIS WEEK. NO EXCUSES."

"event","I just got off the phone with Emily and it kind of made me feel bad. It wasn't Emily, its because of Alex. He said something when she told him it was me and now I am being all paranoid. I feel bad for the way our friendship ended. He meant so much to me when I was friends with him. He was like a little brother. We had so many good times and it was great when he worked across the street from me and would visit me when he got off work. I loved spending time with him. I feel responsible for why it ended and I know its my fault. I apologized when I saw him before I left for Arizona last year. We went to the horizon and talked, but not for very long. I remember we were sitting there and I just started crying because i missed being friends with him so much. i hated being around him this summer because it was so uncomfortable and i feel like he hates me now. I know what i did in the past was wrong but i can't changed no matter how much i regret it. it seems like every best guy friend i have had since nick died, i lost them with it somehow being my fault. With Dusty in freshman and sophomore year. We were awesome friends and it was so awesome hanging out with him and talking about so much stuff. i loved the fact i knew more about him than his girlfriend. We always had a blast at the games and it was just great. Somewhere along the line distance grew between us. I could have tried harder to keep our friendship going but i think, i'm not sure, that somewhere along the line we got into a fight. Doesn't surprise me if that happened. But seeing him and hanging out with him this summer was awesome. It wasn't awkward at all except maybe when i was trying to get him to fool around with me in closets. What about with matt? we argued all the time. i know it wasn't just my fault because he wouldn't leave me alone, but i lost two friends because of him. Now, i am here in arizona with no friends at all and i spend all my time in my bedroom with nothing to do but look back at all my lost friendships. and i almost lost my friendship with emily, but i am thankful now that i didn't because she means a lot to me. I MISS YOU EM!"

"event","Yeah! I received a very nice care package in the mail today. Its contents were as follows: a t-shirt that kicks ass, a cd which i have listened to approximately 14 minutes of and its hilarious, and a plastic bag filled with cookies which i shall discuss further. The cookies were frosted with various colors and the only color which i can really tell what it is, is green. The cookies came in various shapes including: dinosaurs with their heads chopped and some with nipped tails, parts of stars, small pieces the size of quarters which i enjoy the most because they are ""bite size,"" and many many crumbs. Do not take this wrong i love these cookies they are very good and delicious and i believe i have eaten too many today, but what boggles my mind is the dinosaurs with their heads chopped off. There is not one dinosaur with its head intact. This makes me wonder if this is a deliberate threat on my body parts or the specific wish of the displacement of my head. 

Working out has been displeasing the past two days. i have done twice as many reps for everything i normally do and i feel nothing anymore, where has that wonderful burning feeling gone? I feel like i'm doing stuff and its not having an affect on me. Its an extreme disappointment. So much so that i couldn't even sleep last night, i was tossing and turning because my efforts have seemed fruitless."

I even did winsor pilates which is actually pretty easy. I have a rug burn on my knee and i don't know where it came from but it kind of stings. school is going all right but i need to quit slacking off. I am catching up on my reading for my POS 315 class. And i am going to study some espanol tonight. I hate that class. The teacher sucks. I didn't like the one last year but he was definately better that this chick. She placed a bracket by the names of me and three of my fellow students. ""We aren't in trouble, she is just going to keep an eye on us."" Apparently its because we were talking...hmm...that's one conversation i missed out on. there was something else about her that i was going to complain about...i don't remember. oh, well its not that important."

My name is volatile 
I've been this way a long while 
I'd surely like to rest 
But the energy gets the best of me 
It's been a wild ride 
I wouldn't change a minute 
I can't slow down inside 
Guess that's why I live it

The years of mischief 
Followed by weeks of thrift 
I land on earth's hard face 
No legs could keep that pace 
And through the rest I sift

Is there ever a time
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated 
Come monday morn you feel checkmated 
You can be uncool and become the rule 
Exceptions were made to drown

I'm not used to it, you'd think I'd be by now 
The ins the outs the ups and the downs

I wanna make a mess 
I wanna blow off stress 
I wanna stoke the fire 
Just creatures for a while 
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, Just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes 

Sometimes I go a little crazy 
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you we're gonna say 
But were afraid to cause dismay 
You're lyrics switched around 
The mixture watered down 
And now a pointless display

It's something one won't understand 
Unless there in it with me hand and hand

Don't buy the fear don't buy that my dear 
The things you love you must keep near and 
Carry on and you won't feel withdrawn 
Even if you're coming down

Sometimes it's wearable sometimes is bearable 
I careen towards balance til' the glass is full

I wanna make a mess 
I wanna blow off stress 
I wanna stoke the fire 
Just creatures for a while 
I wanna make a mess 
I wanna blow off stress 
I wanna stoke the fire 
Just creatures, just creatures

It comes and goes and comes and goes 
Sometimes
Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like you

I go a little crazy 
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do 
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do


I want to buy this cd but i don't want get screwed and have some terrible cd with one good song on it"

Its the green one with the clover which i have never seen before. I do have the blue one with the clover on it but it is too big. I can't wait to get the shirt because i need new tshirts really bad. Maybe i should go check out the goodwill or something. eh i don't know.so this weekend i am going to yuma. should be fun, i tend to enjoy myself whenever i go. i wanted to get my tattoo touched up but i don't think i will have enough time so instead i will do it next weekend i suppose."

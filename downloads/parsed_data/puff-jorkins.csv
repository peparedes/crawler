"event","Oh my goodness! I heard that some poor Slytherin boy was found unconscious!

So I was thinking about that and taking a short walk the other day, and accidentally tripped and scraped my knee. It was a good thing I just happened to be by the hospital wing, so I was able to go there to have Pomfrey fix me up, and he's in a <i>coma</i>! I recognized him as one of the Strange boys. How awful! I feel so terrible for him. I hope he comes out of it soon! Madame Pomfrey wouldn't tell me exactly what happened while she was bandaging me up, she was muttering about drinking and irresponsibility before she kicked me out and told me to mind my business. Poor boy!

I'm going to miss all the excitement of Hogwarts. I really haven't a clue what I'm going to do for a job... I guess I could work in the Ministry.. or something. I don't know what I'd do there. Hmmph. All this thinking about the future is hurting my head, I'm going to go to dinner now."

"event","I can't believe that I'm going to be graduating soon! It's so weird... I mean, I've been here for so long! I'll miss everything, though. Well, not the homework or tests. That's boring. But I'll miss my friends and all that other stuff. It'll be sad without them. I guess I'm going to have to get a job at the Ministry of Magic or something like that. I'm not really sure what I want to do yet, but I guess I've got to decide. With the graduating and all. I'd rather not be homeless. It doesn't really look like it'd be very much fun.

I'm hearing a lot about people getting married and having babies. And I wonder how Remus is doing, I've been hearing about him as well. And bunches of other stuff that aren't that interesting, so I won't talk about it.

Oh, Rosie, have you gotten to go outside and enjoy nature.. or whatever it was you were planning on doing, yet?

<lj-cut text=""private I guess"">
I talked to Lykos the other day. He was really nice! He's cute, too. I helped him to find someone to get Herbology help with and stuff. I guess he's going to find Rosie outside to ask her to tutor him. She will; I know it. Because she's one of the nicest people ever."

"event","The funniest thing <b>ever</b> happened today!Or maybe not <i>ever</i> but the funniest thing in a long time!
I was in Herbology, trying to avoid the Devil's Snare, and all of a sudden a couple Slytherins bent over to pick up more fertilizer and their pants split!!!

I was laughing for <i>so</i> long! They looked so mad though... I wonder what happened to cause all of their pants to be in such poor condition?

Anyway! Hogsmeade this weekend, yay! Anyone want to do something? Mellie? Rosie? Whoever?"

"event","Wow, it's been forever since I've written in this thing!
I guess because I haven't really had anything to write. Life here at Hogwarts has been <i>bor-ing</i>.

But now I'm on a mission to find out.. stuff. So if anyone knows about any of the stuff that I'm talking about, then you can tell me! Heh.

In really unrelated news, I failed another Potions test. I studied I really hard, too! But I just can't understand any of it. :(
I just hope I start doing better, because not graduating would be a very bad thing indeed."

"event","I'm bored! //Private to Hufflepuffs// Do you know this girl named Miranda? She's a Slytherin? I bumped into her before and she acted really odd. //End Private// But I'm excited for Easter break! I get to not do work and to see Mum and Dad and everyone <strike>if they're not too busy with business and the MOM</strike>... and there's games for my younger cousins. It's always real fun, so I'm looking foward to that. Otherwise... guys, I'm bored!"

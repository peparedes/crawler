her boyfriend keeps her out all the time,and if that's not bad enough, he's always so perky and disgusting and puppy-eyed and shit. >_<
she's always babbling about him to everyone, and it's not like he's anything special.
i mean, she doesn't need a boyfriend. why would she need a boyfriend? I keep her company, I listen to her problems, I've been wither since birth, I'm her sister, and ... and
... 
if she doesn't need me anymore... what's my reason for living?"

Being a resident at the hospital is draining, but it's worth it, I think. I really love working at a hospital, because there's so many things that I can fix.
Illnesses are mostly curable, epecially with the new technology that's coming out.
And being able to open up a child's cast, and have them walk, or meet a new mother... that experience can't be replaced.
Everything that goes wrong... even though it's really bad, I have the power to fix it...
Also, I have fairly regular hours now, unlike when I was an intern, so I have free time to do stuff with my ... crush?
I'm not sure he's my boyfriend... he doesn't seem to realise thatI like him that way, isn't that strange?
I think that I'm going to try seriously courting him now...
We've known each other for a while, at least 2 months, and I want to be able to have fun with him on an OFFICIAL date X3
I wonder how to start, subtle or totally not?"

ari can't seem to get it into her head that i can't change hair.
i mean, i could change the growing roots, but the stuff that's already there isn't gonna change...
and since there's no melanin producers in her white fluff, i can't change that at all =.=
but eyes change, and so does the distribution of fat and skin colour... so if i flake off the old stuff, i can make myself look pretty different, as long as i do something with the hair to hie that awful white streak. it's sooooo recognisable >.<"

I think Ginji's partner is trying to suck up to me because of the cookies...
He drew me ^o^
It's actually pretty acurate, based on my icon.

A bit green isn't it? But that's what I was wearing that day, so ... yeah ^_^
Just got back from sparring at the dojo that day.
I think he deserves cookies, don't you?"

Yay for Christams fun with the family.
I loke cooking... and baking in particular. Nothing better than the smell of gingerbread cookies ^_^
And Ginji likes them too, so what can I say?
Okay, so Christmas was over a few days ago, so what? 
I can stil bake cookies! *hurt look*
Especially ones that attract my crush

Payne is annoying.
I know sometings wrong... she's all quiet all of a sudden, and she sleeps too much.
Why does she seem to think I'd get mad with her?
...
It's sorta funny though, I mean, when she goes out, she always changes something so that she doesn't look like me...
I don't understand how, but she moves around the chubby bits so that this body looks totally different...
Not to mention the fact that she sometimes changes eye colours and the like...
I wonder though...
Does she ever go out in my appeareance?"

ari's sleeping inside right now, which is a good ting, since i wouldn't be able to handle it if she woke up and realised that i've done some really bad things with her body...
i can put everything back though... if i just focus hard enough, i can re-make what i just lost...

"event","I guess I should explain about the streak of white in my hair, huh?
It's not anything special, but people always want to know.
I was really little, little enough that Hailey wasn't around, and mother was having one of her parties.
One of the ones where she and her crazed friends would get together to light candles and get drunk and rave about, praying to the spirits.
You can see where this story is leading, can't you?
Well, they danced and lit candles, and drank. A lot. 
The bottles got broken, and I was, what, 3 years old?
I must have thoguht that the glass was shiny, because apparently, then next thing I knew, there was a bit of glass in my hand, and a giant slash across my forehead.
At least, that's what Lily tells me.
She was only 8 at the time, but since mother and her friends were all so doped up that they couldn't possibly even IMAGINE driving straight, let alone actually do the task, Sis grabbed me, and poured water over my head. Then, she grabbed money from mother's pocket and public transited me to the hospital which was all of 30 minutes away.
Thank god some good samitarian gave us directions, or I shudder to think what would've happened to us...
Anyway, as you cfan imagine, it took us a bit until I got treated (15 stiches) and by the time I healed up, my hair was still there, but the colour-producers were damaged, and so I got a set of completely white bangs.
It's sorta funny, Payne can change hair colours to anything, but no matter what, she can't change those white bangs...
It's not like mother wanted me to get hurt, and she was awfully sorry about the whole thing once she was up, and after Sis got her coffee and a cold compress.
And to her credit she never let one of those dance-y things happen at her house again... she just went to toehr people's houses...
She did the best she could have under the circumstances, but ...
I wish that she could've loved us more...
Loved us enough to really take care of us, and stay with us, and protect us from all that live would throw...
She's still a stranger to me, and I can't bring my self to call her ""Mommy"".
She's only mother... and I guess she always will be."

so, here i am. newly 'born' from the dark numbness where i slept for the last 2 decades or so. and damn, i wanna go back...
not that it's not interesting here... it's just that... it's so complicated. talking ith people, walking, breating, even damnit!
i have to focus on all that because i wasn't born doing it!
it's fuckin' hard!

neway, i guess that's it...
don't wan't ari-chan to realise i've been using her journal.
and she promised that she wouldn't delete any completed entries from the journal, so i'm safe once this is in ^_^"

"event","I met a boy today. ^_^
He's cuuuuuuute...
*blush*
did I just type that? 
well, the whole point of a diary is to record your thoughts, so I'm not going to erase anything...
His name is Ginji(note, I'm changing the names of all the people in my life so that they're not embarrased if they find this), and I haven't really known him for long, but I suppose you could say that he fell into my lap.
or rather, I fell into his...
Class was out, I was dirt tired, and wearing these stupid high heels because of a bet, and I tripped.
And fell into him.
Yeah, it's very cliche, but it happens, and I was really apologetic, since he got a dusty and all, so I invited him and his partner for coffee to make up for it.
Yeah, he has a partner. Who will be refered to as Ban, as a matter of fact.
They're retrievers, which didn't surprise me too much. What with the rising rate of crime, it's become a job that's almost a necessity in this world. But that's where I came up with the idea for their pseudonyms. I watch waaaaaay to much anime >.<
Seriously, though, 'Ginji' is a lot like his cartoon namesake...
Short, spiky golden-brown hair, warm brown eyes, and the nicest disposition ever. His partner has this long black hair, and a pair of very dark eyes... almost black if you'd believe me.
I learned all this while I babbled (I babbled way too much) nervously, over coffee...
and then he asked me out.
at least, I think he did?
he wants to meet me to go walking at the park when the both of us are less busy 
*starry eyed look*
I can't believe I just typed that...
but I am even more disbelieving that I'm actually considering going.
I mean, I shouldn't be considering this, right?
He's not of my culture, or social circles. We have nothing in common, as far as I can see. He has a SERIOUSLY dangerous job. His partner is the most abraisive ting on this earth. Mother would SOOO mot approve of him. But still... I like him 
^_^
His smile glows."

Alright, I'm not going to panic, not going to...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH 
...
Well, I'm getting better now, I think... the scream wasn't that long this time.
Well, you'd be screaming too if you just found out that you had a twin, who's been living in the back of your head, and just woke up... in your body.
I really don't mind too too much... it's just that... she's so DIFFERENT.
Payne has the strangest notions about the world, and she is so LOUD.
She does the most embarrasing things, and not only that, but she does it in MY body. I mean, she actually shares my body with me, and whenever I let her go, she immediately gallumphs down to the nearest bar, gets totally drunk, then proceeds to flirt with anything that lives and breathes.. and somethimes it doesn't even need to be breathing. XP
...
It's not that I'm mad at her. I mean, it's not HER fault that her body died when we were born, and so she got pulled into MINE. And I guess I've had it lucky, being the only person in my skull for so long. It's just...
I wish that she didn't have to hurt so much that her only choice wass to get drunk. I mean, what other reason could there be?
There's so many other things out there, and she KNOWS that, she can see all my memories, but she never wants to explore the world... 
And you'd HAVE to be in pain not to want to do that...
Wouldn't you?"

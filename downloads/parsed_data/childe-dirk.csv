"event","So I was trying to come up with something to do with blog, as I'm getting tired of every post being about how I promise to start posting. I needed something that would give me a reason to write on a regular basis.  As much as I like my job, I doubt most people would care to read about my day of visiting a half dozen Best Buy stores.  Then my wife gave me a great idea (because she's smarter that I am).  One of the side effects of doing a lot of traveling, is doing a lot of eating out.  I've also been on a bit of  brewery kick recently.  So, while I'm not planing to make this exclusivly a food blog, I'm going to start doing write ups on the places I go to eat. 

Recently my wife and I went on a short vacation to Colorado and went on a tour of the New Belgium brewery. I highly recommend this tour if you like beer. Real beer. If the beer you drink comes in a can please stop reading now. New Belgium, while known throughout the country for Fat Tire beer, has many other beers you may not be aware of. My personal favorite being &quot;1554&quot; the Belgian Black Ale. The tour provides you with plenty of beer, 5 different samples over the course of the tour. There is, sad to say, no restaurant in the brewery, nor can you even purchase a pint at the bar.  Because Fort Collins, CO is a college town there is a fear that things would get out of hand.  Having lived in a college town, and having consumed my share of beer, this is probably a good idea.

Later in the same week we found ourselves at the Estes Park Brewery. You have to respect a brewery who has a beer named after Stephen King's ""The Shining."" Estes Park, Colorado was the city that inspired the novel and the filming location for the Made-For-TV version of the film from a number of years ago.  We had dinner with family that night and brought a six pack of various beers with us.  The Staggering Elk Lager here was great.  The Gold (Blonde Ale) was less impressive.  My wife was a big fan of the Rasberry Wheat.  

After we got back to California my wife accopanied me on a sales trip up to California's north coast.  We'll get to that next time."

"event","So yes, it's been forever and a day since I posted anything here.  Having said that, this weekend I talked my way into doing more writing, in a semi-professional capacity, and so I figure I need to start getting back into practice.

So I fell off the writing wagon a little over a year ago.  The economy slapped me upside the head and I found myself unemployed.  The main reason I stopped writing was that I simply didn't find myself in front of a computer as often.  Then I found what appeared to be a great new opportunity.  It then appeared that I was wrong.  Then I did something really silly and put all my eggs in one basket.  Luckily fate paid me back and I got the job I was hoping, praying, biting and clawing for.  For the last 3 months I've been managing sales in 3 states for Polk Audio.  Now i find myself in front of a computer almost every waking minute, but I'm so busy I am either without the time, or more honestly, without the energy, to write. 

 I'm currently at McCarren airport in Las Vegas waiting for my delayed flight home, so I do have the time, but after spending all week here working Infocomm10, I'm still not sure I have the energy.  

The single best thing about my new job is that the people I work with, including those above me, seem truly interested in my ideas as well as my ailities.  When our PR consultant mentioned he was working on bringing back the company's newspaper style industry newsletter, ""The Speaker Specialist"" and I mentioned my writing experience, I got drafted.  Because I'm the resident ""gamer"" on the sales staff, guess who's taking a (terrifyingly) important role in pushing the new Hitmaster Gaming Stage Monitor?  Yeah.

So, if anybody is still bothering to check this blog, I can't promise you daily updates, but I'll certainly be writing more if only to get back in the swing of things.

There's lots of work to do."

"event","Ok, let me start by saying that Knight Rider is not high art.    When I was a kid a show about a talking car was cool.  I have since watched episodes of the original series on my Netflix instant queue and while they aren't nearly as cool as I remember I would still classify them as ""fun.""

When the began to air the remake I wasn't hoping for award winning acting, I was hoping for fun.  I watched the first several episodes and my main area of disappointment was that the show was too serious.  There was government intrigue and conspiracies (because you can't have a TV drama these days without a conspiracy).  The original Knight Rider basically consisted of David Hasselhoff driving around the country and stumbling into problems that needed to be solved.  Small stuff, corrupt small town sheriffs, and ranchers fighting over water rights, that kind of stuff.  Around November or December the show was canceled.  I'm just now catching up on the end of the series and now I'm annoyed.  They've ended the conspiracy and now Michael is caught in a random bank robbery.  That's what this show is all about.

Except its already been canceled.

Oh well."

The state of California wanted to define themselves what made a &quot;violent&quot; video game, and then make it a crime punishable by a $1000 fine to sell said game to a minor.  While I myself would probably not let any kids of my own play Call of Duty, I also wouldn't let them play Extreme Beach Volleyball.  Probably not when they're 9.  When they're 16, depending on how I feel about my child, it may be a different story.

I have never and will never argue that video games do not effect people.  The simple fact is that games do not make people killers.  If messed up teenagers who shoot up malls happen to play video games the only thing that proves, is that they are FUCKING TEENAGERS.  Teenagers play video games.  Is there a causal connection between school shootings and eating McDonald's?"

I may not be conservative but it bothers me how completely out of it the republican party really seems to be.  I believe debate is a good thing.  I believe competition is a good thing.  There are democrats who will run rampant if you let them.  The minority party is supposed to protect us from the majority party taking over.

Sorry it has been so long since I posted (assuming you actually care).

I've spent most of the last month in the office, where corporate IT has blocked LJ.  I don't have web access in the field anymore either so I really only have time to post in hotel rooms or at home, and usually by the time I get there the last thing I want to do is use a computer.  

So there was Christmas, Meredith and I hosted our families. It was fun.

New Year's party with friends and Rock Band 2.

My company had their first layoffs which include a friend and co-worker in my office.  It looks like she'll land on her feet but she's moving away and that sucks.

We have a new President.  I'm still a little speechless over it all.  I'll remember where I was for that.

A few months ago I got involved with the Entertainment Consumer Association, an advocacy group for the rights of game players.  I agreed to take on the position of Chapter President for Sacramento.  I've spent most of my free time (both minutes) trying to get things off the ground in the new year.  If you happen to be in the greater Sacramento area and interested in keeping your freedom to choose the games you want to play, let me know.

My plan is to start to use the blog more to discuss the political issues important to me: gaming, digital media, DMCA, and all the other aspects of the conversion of politics and technology.  It is, after all, what I do.

Next time I post I'll tell you all about Rep. Joe Baca.  He thinks video games are as dangerous as cigarettes."

I've gotten in trouble for my absolutist view of things in the past.  Most of the time I mean it in jest.  I don't actually mean you are ""wrong"" to like some movie I think is stupid.  

In this case I can't help but be serious and absolutist.  I've honestly tried to look at the other side of the issue and I just can't see it.  I can't see how any right thinking person could be in favor of limiting the rights of adults.  I understand the idea behind limiting the rights of children, I don't agree with most of it, but I understand why some people feel that way.  I understand the idea behind limiting rights to the mentally handicapped, again, I may not always agree, but I understand the point of view.  The same thing goes for non-citizens and illegal immigrants.  

Here,I just can't see it.  We're talking about mature adult citizens here.  I have to be absolute:

-If you are in favor of this, you are a bigot.
-If you are in favor of this, you are no better than any racist.
-If you are in favor of this, you are no better than any sexist.

How any woman or minority could be in favor of limiting rights to a group of people is beyond me.  I'm assuming we're not only talking about white males being in favor of this.  These are the same people who didn't want you to vote.  Don't you see?

Of course really I'm still in favor of my alternative proposal which is, rather than prevent gay marriage, simply abolish heterosexual marriage.  I think that would take care of it.  Since many people who are against gay ""marriage"" are in favor of civil unions just make all state recognized partnerships civil unions.  If you want to be ""married"" that's done in the church of your choice and as such each church chooses who they allow to get married.  However the ""marriage"" is not recognized by the state, just the civil union.  

Then when that mixed race couple, or heck the minority couple, wants to get married and their church won't let them in the door I will POINT and I will LAUGH.  Then I will say ""I told you so.""

Yeah, um.&nbsp; Apparently the ad campaign is in fact based around uniting bigots to vote for the measure."

"event","This was the question I was asked many times Saturday night.  The answer, as strange as it seems to me, is yes.  It does feel a little different.  I cant really explain it.  <br /><br />Saturday Night really was an amazing evening.  Thank you EVERYBODY.  My friends, my family, my new family...everybody was great.  I had a lot of compliments about both the ceremony and reception being really wonderful.  Maybe everybody gets these compliments, but even people who admitted that they didn't necessarily get all of the things we did, still said that it was wonderful that we did things OUR way.<br /><br />By the way, if there was any doubt, <lj user=""kadyg"">&nbsp;is one hell of a caterer.&nbsp; Again, there were lots of compliments here, including at least one &quot;best food I've ever had at a wedding&quot; that I heard about.<br /><br />I guess one of the biggest things one wants from a wedding is the ability to look back on it fondly.&nbsp; I will be able to do that without any problem.<br /><br />The only question now is, what the hell do I do with all my free time.&nbsp; I have nothing to plan for.<br /><br /></lj>"

Does Rick Davis work for me?

"event","<br />I've long been a fan of all the work of Aaron Sorkin.  His writing on The West Wing is just some of the best dialog I've ever heard.  Nobody else I've ever heard can make a conversation sound like music.  <br /><br />Mister Sorkin wrote a piece for the New York Times where President Josiah Bartlet has a conversation with Barack Obama.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21dowd-sorkin.html?_r=1&amp;bl&amp;ex=1222228800&amp;en=007cf9e8faaaf52a&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin"">www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21dowd-sorkin.html</a><br /><br /><br />I've often felt that as much as America claims they want a President like Bartlet was on TV, he would never actually be elected.&nbsp; Americans don't want straight talk (real straight talk, not McCain Bullshit).&nbsp; They want to be lied to.&nbsp; America wants to feel good, smart people make them feel dumb.&nbsp; I'd love to see Obama/Biden go after McCain/Palin in the debates the way Martin Sheen evicerated James Brolin on Television.&nbsp; I'm not sure, if Obama took this advice, things would end favorably for him.&nbsp; America wants to be lied to.&nbsp; Showing McCain/Palin to be the hopeless jokes they are would probably be seen as bullying.&nbsp; But my God would it be a sight to see.&nbsp; A sight to see.<br /><br />"

"event","I hit the podcasting panel looking for tips and while there was some information that I will say was useful there was nothing I hadn't heard before.&nbsp; I played someResistance 2 which was fun, my team lost but I think I played fairly well myself.&nbsp; Wizards of the Coast had a promo going so I played a demo of a new XBLA Magic game that I actualy found quite fun.&nbsp; I ended up with some free cards and a Magic messenger bag.&nbsp; I bought a couple t-shirts including one for Meredith I hope she likes.&nbsp; What I thought would be a Dragonage game demo was actually a tool set demo.&nbsp; It was cool, but going through all the different aspects of how to build your own levels was dry.&nbsp; Then we got to look at Spore which looked really cool.&nbsp; This game has been getting a lot of hype but I honestly hadn't cared much.&nbsp; The demo looked really fun.&nbsp; Ninjas vs. Pirates Dodgeball was fairly lame.&nbsp; The final round of the Omegathon was contested with a best of seven battle of Vs. Excitebike, a Famicom game never realeased in the USA.&nbsp; My cousin Ashley who just moved to Tacoma came down and joined us for dinner which was cool since she can't make it to the wedding.&nbsp; 
Con over, Monday was a day to relax.&nbsp; Most of the crew took off for home but Greg stayed in town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of us had already done most of the standard torsit stuff but neither of us had seen the Pacific Science Center, it's sort of like the Exploratorium but not as cool.&nbsp; Which is not to say it was not cool in its own right.&nbsp; Then we decided to check out The Dark Knight in IMAX which was pretty sweet.&nbsp; Then Greg's brother picked us up, we got some dinner and hung out at his place and watched Michael Clayton, which was good.&nbsp; Tomorrow it's off to Denver"

"event","So first I checked out the marketing/PR panel.&nbsp; Mainly focusing on the incestuous relationship between the gaming media and the advertisers.&nbsp; We hit the show floor and I got to play some SMackdown vs. Raw for the Wii.&nbsp; My Matt Hardy vs. Greg's Mr. Kennedy.&nbsp; Greg was having control issues but I'm pretty sure I would have kicked his ass anyway.&nbsp; The control seems a little weak, I seemed to do the same move regardless of which direction I swung the remote.
We watched Gabe &amp; Tycho put Monday's comic together, a good time as it was last year.&nbsp; Next was the live demo for Fallout 3.&nbsp; Holy Shit.&nbsp; This game is something else.&nbsp; Never has a nuclear haloucaust been so beautiful.&nbsp; FarCry 2 hadn't really been on my radar screen but wow.&nbsp; A lot of games claim &quot;completley destrucable environments, but can you start a fucking grass fire in those games?&nbsp; Grass fires that spread into trees?&nbsp; No, no you can't.&nbsp; The new Prince of Persia still looks good but I have questions about the voice acting.&nbsp; The prince doesn't sound persian.&nbsp; He sounds like a generic modern action hero.
Went to the concert of the evening but left shortly after it started.&nbsp; The sound guy still needs a kick in the head.
However, before that we were treated to the Sex Generals rocking out to Journey on Rockband 2.&nbsp; They all played on expert and they tore it up.&nbsp; Then we watched theOmegathon battle of the bands as they played &quot;Eye of the Tiger.&quot; Sweet"

"event","So 6D6N in HKG has passed so fast and it felt like I didn&#39;t have enough time to enjoy as much as I would like to although I did! I had great food, a great time shopping although I didn&#39;t buy as much. It must be the whole growing up thing. I used to lug almost two luggages worth of clothes back from BKK/TW whenever I go but it&#39;s no longer that way. I think hard and long before buying something and I make sure that whatever I am buying, is something that I really fancy. Not just because it is dirt cheap.

And of course having Eugene as my travel buddy has lots of perks. I am literally 100% dependent on him to bring us to our destination. And of course if he went the wrong way or when we couldn&#39;t find it, I&#39;ll throw some hissy fit and complain about his incompetency of locating the place. However, he is extremely good at it! We almost never get lost although we walked a lot... crazy lot!! But because massages in HKG is not as cheap as BKK, we didn&#39;t want to indulge in those overpriced massage places. :(

I&#39;ll upload some of the photos soon but right now, it&#39;s me, a cuppa hot japanese green tea and 90210 marathon.

"event","Today marks the end of my examinations, which also means, goodbye spring semester! Before I start getting worried about the upcoming summer semester in two weeks&#39; time, it&#39;s time to have all the fun I deserved. Although this is gonna be a short break but it&#39;s gonna be a fulfilling one since I&#39;m hitting the dimsum land. 

This quote always comes to my mind whenever I am about to plan my itinerary for any of my trips.

&ldquo;Once you have traveled, the voyage never ends, but is played out over and over again in the quietest chambers. The mind can never break off from the journey.&rdquo;
- Pat Conroy

It is so true. It started out by going to nearer countries and then slowly branching out to countries out of south east asia. &nbsp;I enjoy experiencing the city life of other countries, cheap and amazing shopping as well as orgasmically good food. As much as I like to travel, I don&#39;t have the income nor the time to do it as often as I would like. But I&#39;m more than contented to fly out of Singapore for at least twice a year, escaping from the daily mundane life of a student. 

Hence, it&#39;s time to get down to planning my trip which is in 5 days&#39; time!

I have no idea when are you gonna see this post since you&#39;re always saying that my blog is dead and I doubt you&#39;ll drop by here anytime soon. But here&#39;s a little surprise post for you.

It&#39;s our 3rd year and 2nd monthsary in 2 days time. I know we haven&#39;t been doing anything special for our monthsaries cause we&#39;re way past those &quot;dates&quot; but I want to do a little something here. (If you think you can run away from celebrating our anniversaries, you are so wrong!)

We have been pretty busy with our own lives juggling work with fun and I&#39;m glad we&#39;re still doing well. At least I think I have. Hahaha and once again, as usual, I want to thank you for everything that you have done and given me. I know I am hard to deal with but yet you still suck it up. My parents often wonder what did I do to deserve a guy like you (although I&#39;d like to think otherwise. I have my virtues too. hehe)

Although 90% of the time we spend together you&#39;re being an ass talking lots of shit, but I still enjoyed every single moment with you. Despite all your flaws, I hope that we have many more monthsaries together till old age.

P.S, if you can talk a little less shit I will love you a little more.

Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up. ~ <i>James A. Baldwin </i>"

"event","Hello abandoned journal,

I just want to say I&#39;ve met really awesome and fun loving people in uni. And I&#39;ve caught up with a few old and new friends over the weeks, which I&#39;m really happy about.

I&#39;m also really thankful for everything that has happened so far in my life, except my grandma&#39;s passing. Although my grandpa&#39;s health hasn&#39;t been good, but I think my family has grown tighter due to this. Besides all the good, I hope that my uncle can be less reliant on others and be more independent. And also hope that my grandpa will be healthy and fit in no time. 

A few more weeks to the exams so it&#39;s time to study and it&#39;s also time to sleep."

"event","So in a blink of an eye, it&#39;s the 31st of December already. 2012 had been amazing to me in many different ways. I have travelled a few times - taiwan, bkk(2) and korea, had pleasant relationship with most of whom are important to me, celebrated my 21st in the best possible way and I will end this year with a bang together with the people I care for!

Thank you to whoever who said that 2012 is the end of the world cause that made me cherish things around me a little more. ;) 2013 will bring on more challenges and things that I have set to do (i.e saving money cause I like to spend to my very last cents and I work only to pay off my travelling expenses and that needs to be changed). Also, I want to have a white christmas in 2013 do you hear that Eugene Hwee?&nbsp;

Additionally, I hope that my uni life would be smooth flowing and of course for myself to be a way more focused on my studies.&nbsp;

Till then.

xoxo, (pretty upset about the fact gossip girl had ended despite the downward&nbsp;spiralling content. I&#39;ve been a fan since 6 years ago!)&nbsp;"

"event","From now on i am not helping one stupid girl with anything, you tell them stuff that is true and they go behind your back and say something anyway, then i get shit started, I fucking hate that kid ahhhhhhhhh!!!!<p> 

Im done with drama i am done being a suposid little kid, im done with all the he said she said shit.
fuck everyone that hates me i dont care anymore. to a small girl with short black hair, i dont hate you and we allready established this, I fogave you a couple weeks back, the reason more shit started is because that kid was talking to another one of my friends wich i frankly did the same thing to look out for her and she threw it right back in my face, I dont care anymore and im not helping anyone.<p>

I have to do certain things in life becaues i care for my girlfriend, i have to do things to be there and TAKE care of my gf, it upsets me to see posts on stupid myspace about me for nothing i did wrong.<p>

You might think that i broke my word but i did not, I want to do this but also have to do this, I dont just want to do this, its not like just going to a show or to cedar point for the day, its an actuall responsabilty. so i never broke my word.<p>

this has been my first real post about my feelings in a long time. Im getting sick of being ridaculed about shit that i do, i fucking do anything and oh im a bad person, im just a follower, im whipped, i have a big ego, im not like i was back then. Of course im not exactly who i was back then, But I am Mikey Arnold and allways Will Be Mikey Arnold, People change people grow up a little, I have a lot of good shit going for me, why can't people be happy for me and not ridicule me for every little move i make.  I have a Girl Friend that actually cares about me and would never fuck me over and I LOVE  so much, A band thats more amazing then 95% of the garbage in Cleveland, Friends I would die for, becoming a booky for a club, and many many more things i dont feel like mentioning. i just dont fucking get it.<p>

this is all and i am done"

"event","""missing something so much never hurt so bad"" My stomach has hurt all day, i have no clue if its from all the beer i chugged last night or the fact that my head is thinking way  to much. Everyone tells me to just forget it, I can't. This means much more to me then anything. I want to just say everything and can't do it, being vague is so hard to explain anything. ahhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm leaving to cry. or just sit here and fucking hate myself for being so dumb.

"event","So tonight was funny, fucking I dont know what was better, the bottle shattering on some guys head and then blood raining all over my pants and all over Miss Rachel. Or how about the skin heads fighting and OI punk rock fags fighting. Or better yet how about the hookers on Detroit road that flashed Davey and I with their ass and twat. Or how about My Friends, meeting random people and eating with the and having a gay waiter who was a tottal dick head. What an amazing night.


I wish you were online doll face

"event","I want to cry but no one wants to hear it. I think this through and through, and time and time again. why does this have to be this way, why is there things I can not change. If I could turn back time, I would. No one can do that and never will and it would fuck up everything as we know it, so it doesn't matter if i could change time. I just don't understand what I do wrong, I fucking hate this so much. I want to lie in my bed and never wake up. I stare at picture upon picture but its not the real thing, It isn't there infront of me. All I can do is read, the one thing I have left to understand what its about. It still doesn't answer  all the questions I have. I hate not knowing this, I hate myself more and more as I stay awake everynight thinking this. I shouldn't get depressed I should be happy but I am alone here in a dark room thinking all the time, everynight with out sleep; it does not help. In the Future, will I be happy? Time will tell.


These words are how I feel about everything that has hapened to me in my entire life."

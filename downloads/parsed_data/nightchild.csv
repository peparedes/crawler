"event","So, we went to Jim Dandy's last night for Karaoke.  On the way back (I was driving, Oni was sitting next to me, and Chris and Holly were in the back seat), Chris suggested that we play ""Speed Limit"".  Of course, none of us knew how to play, so Chris elaborated that when you see a speed limit sign, you yell speed limit.  If you're the last one in the car to yell it, you have to take off an article of clothing.  Well, ok.  First of all, do you have any idea how hard it is to take off your pants while driving?!?  Second of all, chris was the first to lose something, he took off his shirt... man, was I distracted.  Then he and Holly happened to ""lose"" at the same time.  Yeah.  Right.  Chris lost his boxers, and Holly lost her underwear at the same time.  Grr.  I know it's petty, but... but...

I really like him.  Alot.  But he and Holly are just toying with each other.  And they're making each other miserable... which is making me miserable. And I don't know why they just don't suck it up and sing.  but they're jerks.  They have their heads up their asses.

SOMEBODY KILL ME PLEASE!  Thanks.

"event","i have no idea why i titled this entry that.  just a random thing, i guess.

so yeah, i'm in the library right now (as i usually am) just typin' stuff and hanging out with chris.  it's great fun.  i'd type more, but i'm just... eh, i dunno.  (afraid that he's going to look at the screen and see what i'm typing.  oi.  it's not cool.  i'm paranoid about it, i really am.  i mean, it's not that he's evil or anything.  i just... well, kinda didn't say anything.  i should have.  but, eh.  who knows.

he's... well.  yeah.

chris is an odd creature.  he's about... well, shorter than me, and he has the biggest sideburns that are not on a lycanthrope.  it's not that he's got school spirit, it's just that he's a little hyper and needs an excuse to paint his face so he won't seem like a freak.  (aka- me.)  he does comedy routines... but they're almost all dane cook's.  that's fine by me, i like dane cook, but we still tease him about writing his own stuff.  he never does.  he also likes creed.  a lot.  he's going to be scott stapp for halloween.  we tease him about that too.  he's a bouncy little freak, and he listens to bubble gum punk a whole bunch.  we do a radio show together, and we're awesome.

and that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.  oi.

i think i'm going to write my required character sketch about him.  i mean, i picked my friend james as my mentor, and that's going to be probably the most interesting 500 word paper i've written yet.  i wonder how the next one will go.

i'm out.

"event","So there's this game called Animal Crossing.  It's kinda fun.  But more than fun, it's addicting.  Once you start playing, you pretty much should just buy a Gamecube and plug the damn thing into your head and start calling yourself Johnny Neumonic.  Yeah, I remember that movie.  And I liked the damn thing too.

But there's this song on there called K.K. Rockin', and it's a combination of Johnny Be Good and Good Golly Miss Molly.  And it ROCKS!  Why?  It just does.  I love it silly.

Anyway...  I still like Chris... and I'm still unsure as to what to do about it.  I don't want to do anything drastic with BC, but I really REALLY like Chris.  But he just treats me like one of the guys.  Oi.  This sucks.  Alot.

I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO!  SOMEONE SHOOT ME BEFORE I HURT MYSELF, THANK YOU.

I hate caps lock.

I hate college.

I hate boys.

i feel GREAT!!  i can't believe it!  it's insane, it really is.  yesterday i was all sleepy, and today i'm awake!  i guess it takes me a day to wake up.  but i think i broke the cycle.  man, no caffeene or anything.  wow.

i got a radio show.  two, in fact.  my radio name is monkie.  i like it.  i think it rules.  my first show is from 11 to 1 on mondays and wednesdays.  my other show is with chris, aka Big C, from 11 to 12 on tuesdays and thursdays.  it's gonna rock so much.  he's on crack, and it's great, it really is.

but other than that, there's not much going on.  oh, wait, yes there is.  i walked into yet another club and i got elected treasurer.  again.  that makes two.  oi.

so here's what i'm doing my freshman semester of college:
treasurer of Campus Activity Board
treasurer of the Communications Guild
stage manager for Crimes of The Heart
Monkie from 11 to 1
Big C and Monkie from 11 to 12
Student Activites Office employee

oi!  make it stop!  well, no.  i'm crazy and loving it.  i really am.  i love it silly.

and still no word on whether or not james is gay.  that's a boggle that i don't want to face.  oi.

later.  theater class now.

jen who lives across the hall was bitching to me about all the guys she made out with.  two of the guys are my friends, chris and richie, and now i'm worried about them... because i kinda like them.  chris has these big brown eyes that make me feel weird.  richie's just a sweetheart.

but jen didn't get her claws into james, who either likes me or is gay.  i hope he likes me.  i like him.  but considering i like him, it probably means he's gay.  i hate my life.

in other news, things with bc have been on the rocks recently.  he's been a little cranky, and i hope he gets his head out of his ass because i really need him right now.  i haven't really gotten adjusted to all aspects of school yet (including classes, ick.)  but i will soon.  i hope i can deal with all this.

Truth be told, I'm too scared.

I don't want to be alone.

Robby and Doug were going to come with...  but Doug couldn't afford it, and that meant Robby wouldn't set foot within the place.  I mean, it's all well and good that they found each other, and I love them both dearly, but... I dunno.  I guess I just worry too much.

It's 2:02 am, do you know where your nerves of steel are?

I called Sara yesterday...  nothing.  She didn't even call me back.  I really miss her.  I could use a friend right now, and she's the oldest and closest one I've got.  Well, I had... I think.  I don't know what happened to her... to us... god.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

I guess I had better go pack now.

<b>I Am A:</b> Chaotic Good Half-Elf Bard Fighter
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Chaotic Good</b> characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Half-Elves</b> are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Bards</b> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Fighters</b> are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Hanali Cenanil</b> is the Chaotic Good elven goddess of love, beauty, and art. She is also known as the Heart of Gold and Lady Goldheart. Her followers delight in creation and youth, and work to spread happiness, love, and beauty. Their preferred weapon is the dagger.

but i'm terrified.  i know i'm gonna be homesick.  and i know i'm gonna cry for days.  i'm so scared, i feel like a three year old going to pre-school.

odie just came up and put his head on my lap.  god, am i going to miss him.  i've had him since fifth grade, since i moved here for good.  and he's made it so much easier.  he's been such a wonderful dog.  i love him so very very much.  i wish i could take him, but i know i can't afford it.  i wish i could.  oh, how i wish i could.

and colin's gonna be in total hell.  the poor guy.  i wish i could bring him too.  despite him being a jerk sometimes, i love him dearly.  he's been my only real family in name as well as action for a good long while.  and i feel so bad for him.  he's got four more years before he can make the jump... well, no.  that's not true.  he knows that he has places to go, but i don't think that he's going to.  he's gonna stall like me.  but i still wanna pick him up and carry him away from here.  i'm his big sister.  it's my job.

everything's going to be so much harder once i'm gone... well, no.  it's going to be harder in a different way.

WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

i hope i figure it out soon.  otherwise i'm dead in the water with a russian sub headed my way...

moving out isn't going as well as i planned.  i've got too much stuff and there are too many unforseen circumstances that keep popping up.  gah.

after today, i can't help but wonder what my dad's gonna do when i move out.  i feel really bad about it now.  i mean, he's an ass sometimes, but at others, he's a real human being.  and, despite myself, i love him.  i mean, hey.  he's my dad.

it really hurts knowing that your salvation comes at the price of hurting an almost decent human being.

"event","Everyone feels despondent at times and you are no exception. You are feeling so depressed because it seems that everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and you don't quite know which way to turn. So like the proverbial ostrich you are trying to bury your head in the sand. But that won't work - you have to face reality. 

Always anxious to accept the role of the leader, as indeed you often work well with people - but try to stay out of the limelight. You'd like a life of ease with no one to rock the boat and someone who understands you is so important in your life. 

You feel that you should be appreciated far more than you are but no-one seems to care! You feel that you are receiving less than your share and the main problem is that there is no-one to whom you can turn to for sympathy and understanding. The inner stress that you are experiencing makes you quick to take offence but you realize that at this particular moment in time there is little that you can do to relieve the situation. 

You are pretending that the situation around you doesn't matter, but the effort of trying to conceal your emotions and anxieties is resulting in untold stress. The existing situation is disagreeable. You feel unwanted and lonely and you would really like to associate with someone whose ideals are as high as your own. You want to be above the standard of mediocrity and this need to be needed and that need to need has almost become an obsession. You are trying to magnify the need into a compelling urge. You would really like to tell the world how great you are but no, you are holding back because you feel that your peers may treat you with contempt. This is a great pity because you have in fact a unique quality of character, but the continual restraint that you impose on yourself makes you suppress this need for others and you pretend you don't really care. You treat those who criticise you with contempt. However, to be honest, beneath this assumption of indifference you really long for the approval and esteem of others. 

The need for admiration and to be regarded as 'someone special' is perhaps one of the foremost aims in your life at this time. You would like to perhaps do something outrageous or anything that will give you the chance to be recognized as someone special. This desire has now almost become an obsession and in your own way you are trying to fulfill this 'complex' by ensuring you are the center of attention, both at work or play, or in the home. Stop trying so hard and you will find that people will like you for who you are - not for who you are pretending to be. 

There is that inherent fear that you may be prevented from attaining the better things in life - those things that you consider essential to your well-being. So you are prepared to try everything to prove to yourself that whatever you do or try will go wrong. This destructive attitude could come under the heading of 'a self fulfilling prophecy'. This belittling yourself is your method of disguising how hopeless and what a waste of time you feel that everything is. So now turn it about. As you 'think', so you are... So 'imagine' yourself successful. 'Pretend', 'act it out' and you may be pleasantly surprised at the outcome."

Duh.  What else is new.





On to the angst.



<u>miser</u>
that was cheap.
that was so fucking cheap.
i gave you a road that you could have taken
and you ran me over to get to the other one.
excuse after excuse
as to why you couldn't do it.
and now you do the same thing
with someone else.
don't bring your real life into this,
play with what you've got.
but you won't.
and that's cheap, my friend.
so fucking cheap.



<u>torture (never try)</u>
i don't know why i try anymore.
god knows, it's been hell enough.
so let it end, let me die, let my life be in vain.
it seems to be that way already.
it seems to be nothing more than amusement
for those who care enough to send the very best
to destroy me.

i don't know why i try anymore.
should i turn a little more
so you can tear me open from the front?
or should i spread out my arms
so you can get a clean shot with your jagged knife into my back?
i doubt i'm bloody and scraped raw enough for your taste.
shall i skin myself?
or will that deny you a pleasure 
that you haven't broken from me yet?

i don't know why i try anymore.
i should have seen it coming a nine-mile-island away.
but i guess i was blinded
by abuse-called-friendship.
and now you do me final indignity
and you won't let me die.
so let me bleed, then heal me.
then come back with your blackened heart
and beat my wounds open again with your blunt words.
but you'll never let me die.

and i don't know why i ever tried.



<u>...that the hell inside me becomes the...</u>
sky.
it is warm and full
like my once-strong beating heart now so beaten and bruised.
it is held above me
and i reach for it like a damned man to a forbidden salvation.
it holds black clouds in night
that have opened up and poured down the

rain.
it pours on my broken body
like cleansing faith falling in vain upon a sinful stain.
it mixes with the blood and sweat on my face
and runs as salty copper pain into my eyes.
it soaks my skin right through to skin so hard
that my clothes are stripped away to leave my wounds naked as the 

earth.
it mixes with the mud and sticks
like death as quicksand that pins me to the place where i bleed.
it catches me when nothing else will
and holds my final moments with dignity and worth.
it puddles up the pools of death and pain
that swirl around inside my head the same way i am caressed by

wind.
it tries to carry me away
like a guardian angel that makes one mistake that is to be my last.
it attempts in vain to pull the swords from my once whole heart
and its grasp is nothing to clear the pain that has become my only sensation.
it is the last blanket i ever have as i realize
that the hell inside me becomes the

sky.


<u>forgotten daemon</u>
she says she's been forgotten
but all i can do is remember
live angel wings in dead daemon night
that chased away my hell
cutting herself every time i bled
giving everything to me...
but times have changed
and now i hold my leathered wings around me
false innocense in burnt and blackened sinful skin
and watch her as she soars higher than i ever could
laughing and playing
singing and dancing
moving like water and stopping like grace
hand in hand
with one of her own kind
and now I am the one forgotten. 



<i>(the next one is totally out of character with the others.  i thought i'd end with somewhat happy stuff.)</i>

<u>Consolation</u>
Smile, little girl.
Night is not as bright when you are away,
but smile, little girl.
Your trial done, your freedom won, you have not much left to fear,
so smile, little girl.
Your legion of knights in shining whites is growing by the day,
if you smile, little girl.
You don't realize what one can surmise
when you smile, little girl.
Bring me life, erase my strife,
and smile, little girl,
for me."

"event","i just read something...

and it makes me feel like i'm nothing.

i realized that i could have lost something, and i made the best of it...  i realized what an ass i've been, and i tried to make up for it...

and then i do lose it, and i try to get over it the best i can...

and then i see that that reasons why i gave it up aren't exactly there...

and... and i don't know anymore.


<i><b> i give up.  i'm done.
you've won, life, you've won.
i can't seem to smile anymore...
no, i can't seem to smile anymore.</b>

Well, with my job and dealing with people from all over the world (India, Japan, Brazil, Panama, Egypt, and Jamaica just to name a few) I am constantly amazed at the interpersonal and intrapersonal exchanges that happen. The way that very different cultures interact in a place where both cultures are out of place. All of the good and the bad. Take for example, two students from different countries that absolutely hate each other will sit down and share a single plate of food together while offering to everyone else as well. But when they're done, it's back to backstabbing and rumor milling about the other one. They all seem to share a single trait that is not common to Americans. When they eat, almost everyone from everywhere shares their food with everyone else. There's never a single meal for anyone...food is always to be shared. It's amazing to see the way people interact and how much we rely on each other. And often enough, for either good or bad, how people never seem to grow up.

Anyhow...."

"event","Well, I gave my two weeks notice at work...and didn't go very well. The boss got pissed which is not a good thing. (Let me preface this by saying this is a guy who dropped a student from india off and left him alone in downtown houston while coming from the airport when he found out that the student's money transfer hadn't come in yet, just pulled over on the side of the interstate and kicked him out and drove off). Anyways, he got pissed and stormed around like a four year old kid. The next day he sent his wife to talk to me (and she is an absolute BITCH). She said some stuff about me leaving and asked if I was willing to negotiate (like we actually need to....just give me what I want and no one gets hurt, lady). So I being curious at the moment said yes. Well they offered me an additional $10,000 a year on top of what I'm already getting and put me on salary(!!!) which is unheard of for flight instructors. So long story short, I'll be staying in Conroe. And since I don't have to work as hard, now I'll get more time off, which should equate to more time around Emory and such. Anywho, i've rambled enough."

"event","I'm sure that by now, most of you have heard about the NY Yankee pitcher who flew into that building. Now don't get me wrong, I hate to hear about pilots getting killed, but try to keep it in context folks. Yes, it sucks that one of us General Aviation guys bit the dust, but if it was me or just another ""joe blow pilot"", you wouldn't have heard a word about it for more than one night on NBC Night Line, even if we hit a building. 

And to make it worse is all the stupid politicians and news reporters who are out running their mouths without checking the facts. Hey guys, talk to someone who lives by the rules before you start saying that there are no rules. There was a reporter on World News Tonight who said that there were no rules for flying over cities. Not only are there Air Traffic Control rules that pilots must follow, but Title 14 US CFR 91.119 say that while flying over congested areas "" No person may operate an aircraft below the following, except as necessary for takeoff and landing. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly or persons, and altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obsticle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet."" And that's not taking into account that the FAA considers two cows in a field to be a congested area. 

Then you have the Yahoo! main page headline of ""Why was a plane able to fly over New York?"" Do these people really think that airplanes don't fly over New York? Yes, there has been changes in the structure of the airspace around New York and other areas that make the airspace a little more restrictive, but come on, if they were over some area they shouldn't have been, there would have been alerts going off everywhere. Notice there's no officals saying that they were alerting the military of an aircraft being where it's not supposed to be. If you wanna talk about pilots going where they're not supposed to be, then lets not forget about the student pilot and instructor that flew around for several minutes in the PROHIBITED airspace over Washington DC about a year ago. Or the guy who landed his airplane on the White House lawn during Clintons Administration.

But, the Coup De Grace about the whole situation is the politicians who are now vocally wanting to make the rules more stringent. Come on guys, things are tough enough regulations wise for general aviation. Lets not make it worse by making knee jerk reactionary rules. And if they're worried about someone loading up a small airplane with explosives and flying it into something, let me say the aerodynamics of putting a bunch of weight into a small airplane and trying to fly it aside, you could do just the same amount if not more damage with a car or truck. For example, the Oklahoma City Bombing, they used a van, and there was more weight in the cargo portion of the van than a lot of small airplanes can carry with one pilot and full fuel tanks. So, if they're going to add regulations about us, how about restricting cars and trucks as well.

Oh well, but what do I know."

1) When there's only one other person in the elevator, tap them on the shoulder and then pretend it wasn't you.

2) Push the buttons and pretend they give you a shock. Smile, and go back for more.

3) Ask if you can push the button for other people, but push the wrong ones.

4) Call the Psychic Hotline from your cell phone and ask if they know what floor your on.

5) Hold the doors open and say your waiting for a friend. After a while, let the doors close, and say, ""Hi Greg. How's your day been?""

6) Drop a pen and wait until someone goes to pick it up, then scream, ""That's mine!""

7) Bring a camera and take pictures of everyone in the elevator.

8) Move your desk into the elevator and whenever anyone gets on, ask if they have an apointment.

9) Lay down the twister mat and ask people if they would like to play.

10) Leave a box in the corner, and when someone gets on, ask them if they can hear ticking.

11) Pretend you are a flight attendant and review emergency procedures and exits with the passengers.

12) Ask, ""Did you feel that?""

13) Stand really close to someone, sniffing them occasionally.

14) When the doors close, announce to the others, ""It's okay, don't panic, they open again!""

15) Swat at flies that don't exist.

16) Tell people that you can see their aura.

17) Call out, ""Group Hug!""and then enforce it.

18) Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering, ""Shut up, all of you, just shut up!""

19) Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside, ask, ""Got enough air in there?""

20) Stand silently and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off.

21) Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce in horror, ""Your one of THEM!"" and back away slowly.

22) Wear a puppet on your hand and use it to talk to the other passengers.

23) Listen to the elevator walls with your stethoscope.

24) Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button.

25) Stare, grinning at another passenger for a while, then announce, ""I have new socks on"".

26) Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers, ""This is MY personal space!"""

Earlier today I got a funny little notion, the distinct feeling that I was alive, but not really living...like there was so much I'm missing out on. And I can't really shake the feeling that I've missed something along the way that was important. Feels like I'm standing at a crossroads and not knowing which way to go and no end in sight. Feels like I'm waiting on something. It's a lot like the feeling you get when your walking down the road and cars keep passing you and no one stops, but keep hurring on to their destinations as you watch them go by.  And the only thing worse than feeling lost has to be waiting while feeling lost. *sigh*
Of course the fact that the only thing to do here is pretty much watch paint dry doesn't help very much. There's nothing to do here to take my mind off of things except to drink...and I can only stand so much alcohol before I'm just tired of lifting the bottle. And other than work my usual three days a week, I haven't had anything to do for the last three weeks, which were spend laying on the couch staring at the ceiling and thinking. (Not exactly the exciting life you would imagine for a pilot, huh?)And if I get too much introspection then I start to get self-destructive. And the three friends I have here are all married and are very busy this time of year, so there's no one to talk with either. And I tend to be a very gaurded person, for personal reasons that some of you know, and I spend much of my time second guessing the walls that I've put up, but even more unsure if I should bring them down. So here I sit with nothing to do...nearly a hundred and fifty people in my cell phone and no one to talk to. This SUCKS!!!

"event","Well, after talking to Sarah for about an hour and a half, and at her request, I'm going to share a story of something that happened last sunday at two in the morning. Anyway:
So I was fucking this girl in the ass and she kept trying to crawl away......wait that's not it.

Anyways, last Sunday I called in sick at work, because I just didn't feel like working. So after a trip to the gun range earlier that day, I decided to clean my guns. Now it's 2 a.m. and I'm sitting on my back patio...and I use the term patio loosely, it's actually a 4x4 slab of concrete. So I grab a can of gun scrubber oil and check to make sure that the nozzle is pointed away from me. I sprayed it on the gun and it shot right back into my left eye. And as is natural, when you get something in your eyes, I closed my eyes. So I stood up and turned around going full tilt inside my apartment. But I forgot that I had closed the screen door, and I was damned lucky I didn't take if off it's track. Well, I staggered backwards and nearly fell off the patio, which is about a four foot drop. And when I finally made it into my apartment (eyes still closed mind you) I bounced off a few walls before I made it to the bathroom. From there I washed my eyes out and actually had to pull my left eye open, which was swollen and three different shades of red. But everything was okay, and I can still see. But I must admit I did learn a lesson from this one. And I must say, I don't mind having bad karma just as long as it's quick."

I study several hours a day and then I fly and work. For those who I haven't talked to lately, I'm working on my Instructor's Rating, so I can teach others to fly. It's really eye opening to fly with people who are out to kill you...in a manner of speaking. But, hey, it builds character doesn't it?

So I guess that I'll just say what's been happening lately. I've finished all of my classes, which is nice because now I get an extra three hours of sleep a day. So now all I've got to do is fly and study and study and study. I know I've talked to some of you about my roommate...for those of you who don't know anything about him...in short he's a jack-stick. He does things like waits till I'm out of town and gets drunk and takes a gun of mine and drives around Tulsa shooting at random...sleeps with minors...and is constantly busting my balls. So I asked him to move out last night. And all in all it went well. He saw it coming and this past weekend while I was in Ft. Worth he went appartment shopping. As a matter of fact, the landlord of the appartment complex he's supposed to move into just called and asked me a bunch of questions about him. I played him off as a good guy...not because he is, but because that's the only way to get him out of my place. Finally...maybe I'll have my place to myself again!!!!! But other than that not much has changed. Still taking it all one day at a time and hoping that once he's gone and I can let my hair down (per say) then maybe I won't feel like shit all the time. But we'll see. Have a good one guys."

"event","I seem to have a rather interesting problem. It seems that everytime I get to be friends with someone, after a while, I get this urge to head on down the line. Just pull up and leave. Now I get this urge with everyone, both guys and girls, old and young. I don't know quite what it is, but I just get this urge to leave, to break all contact and go my own way. I did it here a while back with some friends that I've known for the whole three and a half years I've been here (the only people I've known the whole time I've been here). But I just disappeared totally for about 2 months, now during this time they continually called and sent me e-mails asking me if everything was okay and to contact them. It wasn't until they tried to get hold of my parents to check on me that I called them and told them everything was okay. And I did it again about three months ago to a guy who I go to school with who is about one of the people I'm closest to here. I just stopped talking to him, I ignored him anytime he tried to talk to me or called to find out about school stuff. Finally after about two weeks of dodging I stopped. And I've recently made friends with a young couple about my age. We've all hung out several times over the last month, as a matter of fact for a few hours earlier today. And now I've got the urge again. And one of the things that really bugs me is that none of these people have done anything to warrant my behavior. It's nothing personal to them, it's just me. And it really bugs me....why? How come as soon as I start to get to know people I want to leave? There are some people that I've ignored for more than six months now, and for no reason. What the HELL is WRONG here? Does anyone else get this too or is it just me? Let me know, any input is welcome."

Many celebrities turned out to pay thier respects including Mrs. Butterworth, Hngry Jack, the California Rasins, Betty Crocker, and the Hostess Twinkies. The grave was piled high with flours, as long-time friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Fresh rose quickly in the show business though his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting most of his dough on half-baked schemes. Even as a crusty old man, he was considered a roll model for millions. Fresh is survived by his wife. They have two children and one in the oven. He is also survived my his elderly father, Pop Tart. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes."

How dare we be so vain, I want you for me. I want you fro myself and nobody else. Like I have the right to demand that. Where do we get off thinking that we can have someone to be with us for the rest of our lives? What makes us think we deserve to have someone there for us? Why do we feel we must have someone there with us? Is it our own insecurities? Are we afraid that if we don't then we'll miss something? What are we really missing? Anything at all? What is it that would make us stay in the face of so many problems? Are there really that many good times? Is it because we're not happy with who's in the mirror? Is it because they need us? Is it truly because we don't want to be alone? Is it because we think things will be easier? Is this vanity because of something long ago and far away, or is it something in the now? Why do we want and need another? And why do we label those who don't as ""off"" or ""wierd""? Why do we feel we must have that ""connection""? Why must we act this way? Maybe, oneday when time has flown and we no longer care, then we'll know."

""For some reason earlier tonight when I was shaving, I was reminded of seeing death in action. It was when I was working on the ambulance and we got a call to a house close to the ambulance quaters. I'd been there a few times before with the paramedics and I knew that there was an elderly lady who lived there. I also knew from previous experinces that she had several health problems. So when we arrived, her two grown children were there and asked us to help get her out of the car (she was returning from a doctors appointment for blood pressure problems). So I got in the back seat behind her and helped push her out while the paramedics both pulled on her. Well, we got her out and stood up and then she asked us to set her back down that she was feeling light-headed. She said she felt tired. And as soon as she finished saying tired, she just slumped over in my lap. Her eyes rolled back and only showed white. That quickly, over a few seconds, she was gone. Now having her in my lap didn't bother me, what bothered me about the whole incident was how calm and gentle death was with her. One minute coherent and four seconds later...dead. It was just so easy,""

You kido's behave (chuckle chuckle.)

"event","Hello all...or rather, whoever happens upon this. Salutaions from the land of the Sooners...yes that's right the land of the Sooners...not the Laters but the Sooners. (I still haven't figured out why Oklahoman's call themselves Sooners or Boomers...but if I should figure it out, I won't tell you). Life in all of it's glory is still weaving golden treads here and all the rest of that Zen Buddist bull crap. I ran into a girl the other day and she told me to watch where I was going (ha....okay I'll stop)...well to be honest with you...there is really no point to this update, pretty much just meaningless rambling. I seem to do a lot of it here by myself in my apartment. Oh well...oh, by the way, I'll be around on the 24th thru the 28th. So maybe I'll even get to hang out with some of you this time (CHRISTINA). Well, my Ramien noodles (or as I like to call them..the staple food of bachelorhood) are done, so i'll stop my meaningless noise. Goodnight.

"event","How come I feel so old? I'm only 21, but I feel 40. Is it the heartache or is it the loneliness? Is it that I'm living where I'm not liked? Or is it that I'm just lost? I keep thinking about things that have happened and who I am now. And I wonder if I can ever be the person who used to be strong, tough, and really gave a crap. I don't think I can be....too much bad shit has happened. And I despair at the thought of my future...there's just so much uncertainty. I guess that I shouldn't worry, but I don't like to feel that it's all out of my hands and there's not shit I can do. Why do I feel so lost if the battles won? Where do you go when there's no where else to run? Where do you get directions? I just want to be the cold hearted person I used to be. I guess that in the end...it makes no difference.

Sorry that I havent posted lately, but it's been busy here. Been busy having babies...well not me obviously...but some of my friends. Anywho, I just thought I'd say...I'm drunk.......Oh, I learned a neat trick the other day, how to erase the ink off a check, so your left with a blank check with someone;s signature on it. Really cool...Federal Prison here I come. 

Sarah: I ran across some Jim Croche lyrics that I thought you might appreciate:
""Isn't that the way they say it goes,
well let's forget all that.
Give me the number if you can find it, 
so I can call 'em to say that I've 
overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well. 
I only wish that my word could convince myself
that it just wasn't real.""

Well, that's pretty much it for now. I'll leave with a poem from The Book of Counted Sorrows. Have fun guys.

Under the winter moon's pale light, 
across the cold and starry night,
from snowy mountains soaring high,
to ocean shores echoes the cry.
From barren sands to verdant fields,
from city streets to lonely wealds,
cries the tortured human heart,
seeking solace, wisdom, a chart
by which to understand its plight
under the winter moon's pale light.
Dawn is unable to fade the night.
Must we live ever in the blight
under the winter moon's cold light,
lost in loneliness, hate, and fright,
last night, tonight, tomorrow night
under the winter moon's bleak light?

Just let me know what time y'all wanna get together.(yes I used the word y'all).

"event","I know I know, it's been a while since I've posted, but work has been hell lately. And to try and get back to where I was always short of, I'll try and keep it short. Now, I just finished reading John's rant about religion and George Bush.....intresting rant John. Now I don't agree with everything he said, but I'm glad that he said what he did. See that's one of the great things about this country...we don't have to agree with each other. (And that John is why we will never be a peaceable society...this country affords us the right to disagree, and where there's two dissenting oppinions there will never be peace). And I respect the way he feels, even if I disagree. Now let me say that I'm not voting this time (not because I don't like either canidate, but because I'm too fucking lazy to go register). But if I was I would vote for Bush. Now let me say that I would be a moron to say that the man is always at peak performance, he has made some very stupid mistakes (but honestly, had I been in the same spot at the same time I probably would have said a few of the stupid things he said). But I'm not going to go into the whole Iraq thing...the only thing that I'll say about that is: I have friends that I know over there giving their lives for me, and I can't stand to hear people over here that bad mouth the US military....if you wanna bitch, wait till my friends aren't dying. (Fair warning to anyone that I'm around who bad mouths the military (that doesn't mean Bush, just the military) that I won't pull my gun on you to get my point across...that makes me foaming at the mouth, blind rage pissed). If you want to know why I would vote for Bush, it's because I've never heard Kerry answer a question....to those of you who watched the debates on Friday, the modirator asked Kerry how he would go about doing funding his changes in medicare....his answer was that he was going to make changes in Medicare....FUCKING MORON, I don't want to know the changes, answer the Fucking question....the question was how not what (the moderator asked him 3 times and he never answered once)and it seems to be that way on every issue with him. It's not so much that I support Bush, but I can't figure out where Kerry stands. But come November, I don't have the right to bitch anymore no matter what happens. (And John if that means I need to have my balls cut off... then maybe so....but you're the one who will have to do it). And also I do have my own version of what I believe God is, and it's not exactly what mainstream religion says God is. (Yes John, I do believe in God...but I don't believe in hobbits, fairies, or that other bullshit, where'd you get that?)Oh well, I don't want to get on a rant....so let me say that if you don't agree with me, then bugger off, no actually I'm glad that you don't, this is just how I feel.

"event","Well, here I am again. It's very much a blue day. Sitting here reading old letters and wondering where it's all going. Wondering what exactly fate is, and what it isn't. How much of it is fate, and how much of it is me? Wondering where the old me went. Wondering why I've seen more dark skies, than blue ones? Wondering if there are brighter days ahead? Wondering if anyone really wins? Wondering if a person can really change? I keep on thinking of the good times and wondering where they went? Wondering if there is a fight to fight or is it just me? Am I grinding my own wheels? Wondering if there's someone out there for me? Wondering why I feel restless all the time? Wondering if prayers or dreams come true? Wondering what's the point of ""grasping after the wind""? Wondering why it all seemed so clear yesterday and today I can't see the way out of this paper bag? But I guess that I'm mostly just wandering.

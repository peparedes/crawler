Into the Mirror
Tale of Two Sisters
Memento Mori
Resurrection of Little Match Girl
2009 Lost Memories
Bichunmoo
Natural City

Its kinda interesting, I have two Asian films that have blatant tribute to Leon: The Professional. Jeti Li dressed as Leon in ""Hitman"" and now in ""Resurrection..."" there is a guy at a sushi bar  ordering Sushi dressed as Leon (plant, hat, glasses, coat) with a little blond korean girl standing next to him looking like a bad blond mathilda. I got a good chuckle.

15 hours until i can go to sleep for work tomorow. its gonna be rough.

"event","""blind"" by Croccifixio Constantine Caduto

With eyes closed I see the world around me
I watch as the strong take advantage of the weak
I hear the heartbreaking sound of love lost
I feel the pulse of the lost dying alone in darkness
I have travelled across the world without direction
With eyes closed I see the world black around me
I have held and comforted those falling dreams
I have cherished those brief memories touching my heart
I have cursed the strength of stone inside of me
I have weathered the worst of storms and mothers fury
With eyes closed I see the world black inside me
But each moment of love and affection is a small light
and even a candles flame can blind eyes born in darkness
each one of those moments of beauty and happiness
is a small point of light behind my blinded eyes
Those moments light up the sky like the stars
and I am blind no more."

"event","a strange feeling has come over me 
a feeling of bitter sorrow and sweet joy
a moment of tears and smiles
an instance of hope and regret
like the feeling of a beautiful dream
when it fades away too quickly in the morning
leaving a feeling of peace and happiness
as well as an empty yearning to sleep again
I do not cry or regret any longer
it has been ages since I wept for spilled milk
or lamented for the spilling of blood
or the unleashing of sensations best buried
perhaps it is that emptiness that makes me feel
the need to find a meaning in something long dead
hope is a small flame lit suddenly in darkness
it is blinding and magnificent
that is the feeling of conflict so unfelt and dry
but like the light, my eyes adjust and it is a small matter
and I go back into the night and feed.
oh where has my love gone
in a conflict of emotions I am alone again
dreaming. dancing. 
Thinking of you."

"event","Cut from ""Bleak Seasons"" by Glen Cook. It seemed poetic when i read it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fragments . . .

Just blackened fragments, crumbling between my fingers.

All that remains . . . A thousand hours of labor . . . Gone forever

Or are they? I do not want to go back. I do not want to relive the horror. I do not want to reclaim the pain. 

There is pain too deep to withstand right here, right now.

The mind and heart, safely over to the farther shore, simply refuse to encompass the enormity of the voyage.

And there is no time . . . 

There is a war on. Always there is a war on. Just as well to stop now. 

Teardrops make the ink run.

Fragments . . .

 . . . all around, fragments of my work, my life, my love and my pain, scattered in this bleak season . . .

And in the darkness, shards of time."

I am optomistic that power will be restored sometime thursday. I am patching up that window leak in the morning and then I am happy. woohoo.

I want to thank Princess Jen for letting me invade her home and tenjinzan for the offer and all the others who have tried to make my life without power easier. at the very least, thanks for listening to be curse florida power and light.  :)

now for a cheerful little poem i wrote just for this occasion.  :)

I have beggared myself on the couch of a friend and she totally rocks for doing so. and the cats love me too. and I got  to babysit! kids love me. :P

my mood is much better today now that I have slept and stuff and dealt with an ongoing issue or sorts. now, all i need is sleep. tomorrow I am repairing my place (had a leak) and cleaning up, power or no power. at least I cleaned out my fridge before it turned my house into a smelly mess.  :)

seeing nothing- by Croccifixio

Sometimes the world catches up to you
it is strange and often painful to the heart
the feeling of chaos and confusion boiling
emotionless emotion dancing on a string
mistakes and regrets over a lost lingering desire
breaking waves against a stone tasting the salt
the blood song long silent starts crying red tears
rage and anger, sorrow and regret, pain and lust
i think back to a few years ago when i lived like this
when i fought against the nature of my humanity
it is hard being a machine sometimes when the flesh dreams
i cannot think of how stupid i must look
and not compare it to how stupid that I feel
I cannot change who i am and who i have been
all those broken pieces rattling around a cage
waiting to get out, to live again, the breathe
fighting is like putting gasoline on a fire
it burns worse and worse like brilliant trash
how do you forget when you have nothing but memory
i sit here writing this filth and I close my eyes
and see nothing."

"event","a dream. silent. running beneath the waves of sheets.
the taste of fear is in my mouth. the back of my throat.
things that i have done. been done to me. around me.
the gentle kiss of a devil in a red corset. sweet. bitter.
i struggle to awake but there is nothing outside this place
this void where once a heart beat strongly. ages ago.
a time before the sorrow. before rage and hatred. before loss.
barely a memory as i have adapted through the years. stronger.
the last kiss i remember before my life stopped meaning.
blood running down my chin. a look of pity staring me in the face.
or in the mirror. in the darkness. in love.
but it was all a dream. fictional. longing. hoping. calling.
the nightmare is the reality i was left in. abandoned.
my strength carries me though i falter at times.
silk sheets wrapped around me. caressing. satin stockings. leather
restraints. restraint. forgiveness comes from within. distant.
no matter how much pain is inflicted upon me, it will never be enough.
i will never get tired of it. my love. my loss. my heart.
though alone I am dying slowly.
always alone.
dreaming."

countless faces and images flash into my head. so fast. giavonni mclemore. G Love. he saved my ass in prison. Erynn. my first love. my first hate. my longest friend. i still can feel her heart inside of me. Chrystal. my son. death. nothing but pain. my first. junior high school. so long ago. Jimmy. lost before his time last year. Sarah. words cannot begin for her. read my journal. my reason for living. dead. last year also. Tin Man. prison rapist. retard. embodiment of evil. i should have killed him. i doubt his evil ended in prison. Bone Crusher. biggest motherfucker i have met. broke my foot. nicest gangbanger in prison. gentle giant. but he did break my foot. heheh.

Butch. my innocence. me. 15 years ago. growing up. falling down. my old brother. Walter. Kenny. Tony Frank. my brothers from so long ago. i was the worst in the end. Fred. My stepfather. Pure rage. marines do or die. Therapy? Meat Abstract. fantasy bag. McNaughton Correctional Institution. Karl. Jamie. Richard Love. Johnny Laster. my dark brother. my life was shorter than the time he had been in prison. Darkness.Melvin Hibler. half my size and the ability to make me look like a damned fool on the basketball court. every single time. ""dont do it to yourself j. not again"" hehe.

the swat taskforce. my heart stops. death. milwaukee county. waukesha county. washington county. Charged. Gang Kingpin federal court. maximum sentence- life. charges dropped. 5 counts of Armed Robbery with a firearm. maximum sentence possible- 100 years. my sentences...3 years, 6 years, 6 years, 7 years conccurrent, 6 years consecutive withheld sentencing probation. 5 counts possession of concealed firearm- 25 years max. charges dropped and migrated to armed robber charges. drug paraphanelia. charges dropped. fear. life plus 125 possible in time. i got lucky. they should never have let me out. 20 years ago they never would have.

i died in that place. the world ended for me. in prison time stops and the world keeps moving without you. you are displaced. you are reduced to nothing. a number. no more holidays. no more birthdays. no celebrations. nothing. just day after day in a pit with the worst monsters you can imagine. i was one of those monsters. 13 fights i had in there. i lost every single one. never fought against one person. 2 people attempted to rape me. they failed. all the good that was inside of me died there. it was replaced by ruthless madness and aggression. i became very strong. stronger than i was before. i still had my charisma when i got out. i just have a very negative outlook to the world. i have seen the worst the world has. i was the worst.

when i was freed I was scared i would be worse. but the taste of freedom. that closed those doors. i saw beauty again. i have tempered myself. with love. with friends. affection. i have lost my family but i have made my own. Brett. judy. carrie. billy. kile.neil. my one and only brother mark. others. i can never forget all the darkness though. rapists raping people in the cell next to me. listening to the crying and screaming. people being tortured. hell. no fire and brimstone. staying awake all night sharpening my toothbrush because the gangbangers were coming for us in the morning. my prison tattoo. the weightbar across the back of my head. bleeding on the floor of my cell.feeling the snap of breaking someones leg. feeling their teeth crumble under my fist. fighting for my life. fighting to not be raped. wearing magazines around my waist to prevent myself from being stabbed.

i remember 7 years ago when i put my SKS Machinegun into my mouth and pulled the trigger. i still have the .762 round that did not fire. despair. i have been alone for so long. my whole life. i have never had anyone to share my life with. all i have are these words that i write. that nobody ever reads. or nobody gets to read because i delete it all. i remember day when my son was killed. that finally broke me. of all the things in my life to harden me and to break away at my armor. all the things. when she killed my son all my shields disappeared. i was forced to look inside. to deal with it. the soldier died. and then... i started to make peace. first with erynn. then with the others that i had conflict with. because i was so dark. so twisted. so righteous. the last was marisa. i finally made my peace with her and I have found some measure of happiness in that. and in the lack of enemies in my life. i have one more person to deal with. he will not be pleased.

13 years and i now do not know where i go. my whole life i have been a prisoner.  all this time, since i was 8. for the first time in my life now, I will answer to nobody. no more reigns. no collar. no leash. nothing. ""boat drinks"". damn i love kile. in his own darkest hour he made me smile. 

boat drinks everyone. the dream.

its 1159pm march 22nd and I am about to die. do not miss me. the one that replaces me is much better than i ever was.

Croccifixio is now dead. Long live.... Jayme."

Thanksgiving- by Croccfixio Constantine Caduto

Silent song whispers across the night
slowly breathing, sighing, ancient words
the beauty of individuality signals past future now
i reach out to touch you while you sleep
a holiday passes behind us, through us
a gentle smile all in hearts open laughter
though we did not sing we did hear the song
I thank you for your patience with the madness
the swirling sorrow and fears that chase at my heels
your hand upon my shoulder beckons me to a better view
not all is as bad as my mind has made it to be
i hold tight onto the feelings that engulf me
in the silence of the night when you touch me
when i lay my head in your lap contentedly
nothing more could make me feel so happy.
happy thanksgiving darling, thanks for being with me."

empathy is a seething heart bound in fire
Let the angels weep as the tail rips across my back
for no apathy or sympathy nor empathy are in me
ecstasy is a joyous heart screaming in release."

Hell- by Croccifixio Constantine Caduto
there is a dark place in the human heart
the shadowed world if desire and lust 
where the bloody dreams of oblivion reside
through that final doorway few ever venture

i woke up to the sun on my face for the last time
i had slept and woken countless times before
never appreciating it or understanding it
in hell the sunlight is far too close for comfort

as i sat on the edge of my bed staring into the past
i remembered nothing of how i got there or why
only that i had done this to myself for selfish satisfaction
maggots crawled at my feet, the dream forgotten again

that first time when the violence raged within
not a gentle beast to be sure, revisited upon me tenfold
the screams of the not so innocent a terrible melody
we all get what we have given in the end of our lives

Hell is sometimes an eternity, sometimes mere moments
it all depends upon why we sentenced ourselves to torment
and make no mistake, in this place, we put ourselves here
and sometimes we deem ourselves as worthy of our own release.

I stand up out of bed and my scars ache, inside and out.
i look down, away from the burning light that is righteousness
and see my poor shadow reflecting the blackest heart to me
forgiveness and mistakes are like the locusts in a farmers field

i have no clothes to hide beneath to protect me from myself
the wounds are all self inflicted from hatred born within
there is no gentle caress to take me away from here
even a moments repreive would negate my own salvations call

i am lucky in that I know the time of my own death and demise.
it is something i have waited for for so long i cannot remember
the broken mirrors around me only show me myself a thousand times
the sickening from within let out and siphoned away slowly

i do not regret my death as i am self aware that my time has passed.
i murdered my way into being and I myself am executed for rebirth
though most of my life has been trapped here in this place
a self imposed prison of sacrifice and mental rape, i will pass on nothing

in six days Croccifixio Constantine Caduto will finally die alone
how scared am i to even admit that fate to my frightened heart
am i mad to speak in the third person of myself and of what I am?
no. its a part of myself that i leave behind that I might finally escape.

The king is dead. Long live the king"

the long walk down sleeps corridor.
laying awake dreaming to a nightmare.
strange words pretending voices caring.
touching upon a divine minds madness.

faster I run in circles empty center.
eye of the storm a hurricane of disbelief.
the winds rage and dark whispers call.
weather the fury and find peace the heart.

raw meat reflection single blade of grass.
growing taller and smaller isolated barren earth.
the beginning and end of the miracle of life.
a tear falls and nourishes something beautiful.

needles behind the eyes stimulate the visions.
deeper deeper deeper.
the worlds shift and waver microscopic. 
a warm hand against cold skin caresses seperation.

copper metalic sweetness i touch my lips.
the single drop and stolen tear a vitamins worth.
stinging slap of winters binding grip inside.
a reflection in the mirror shatters frozen in time.

forgetting and forgiving different sides of a coin.
desert eagle the mighty quill of solstice.
peace and balance a razor line always cutting.
close your eyes and chose the white ocean drowning.

ample time and time to end playmates wish of blood.
when all is said and nothing is done useless words.
i sit up and awareness speaks again world view.
am i mad or do i dream this loneliness inside of me.

"event","two weeks from today i get off of parole. you would think that i would be happy and all that. i am not. as i figured i am becoming much much more withdrawn from everything. my mind is not with the rest of the world really. i am just thinking. the world seems so much less for some reason. nothing that is real seems to matter to me. its been going on for a while as most people have noticed. its just that now it has gotten to the withdrawn state of things.

I decided that I would write my last song or poem by the last day of parole. i have lost my voice. the words no longer make sense to anyone but me and even then... they are sad and pathetic to my own ears. all that has been my life for these last 13 years is going to come to an end and I will not carry it with me into the future. that day will be the day that Croccifixio Constantine Caduto dies.  perhaps it is time to just be Jayme again. no more bmfd, big dad, virus, fade, jobe or whatever other identity crisis names i have used over the years. I just do not know anymore really.

this upcoming week will be harder on me mentally. or i should say harder on those around me. i can already feel changes inside of me as strange as that may seem. my desires and interests are changing. or closing. only good is coming for me, I know this. the weight will be off my shoulders. the fear will be gone. maybe the nightmares will go away. i will leave hell.

most people do not really know what life has been like for me. as long as i can remember its been one nightmare after another. we all have our own nightmares. I know. i am no stronger or weaker than the next person. but for the first time in my life it looks like i will not be in hell. i will not miss it. but what if I need it. heh. questions and questions. this is what i think like. all i have been thinking. what if. maybe. kinda. I hope so.

anyways, I will continue to write when the words are within me. I will not abandon my friends and associates here or in my life. i will just leave this all behind me. no more prison talk. no more parole talk. no more bullshit. no more pain. all of this is such a black part of my spirit. leaving it behind might actually make me less of the darkness in my life. we are our own worst source of emotion. I am too critical of myself. now i am going to let it go.

for those of you that have been here on this journey, some of you for a decade, I thank you for listening, taking the time to try to understand, and most of all, your tolerance. Croccifixio will die. Jayme will live on in his place. to fix something, it has to be broken first. i have broken far too long.

""Never question the strength of my resolve""

Angels screaming like broken sirens lost in the sea of time
the culmination of an eternity, breathing softly, whispering
temptations oily and slick embrace, pulling me into an ocean
ash and fire glittering and staining, everfelt presence watching
big brother and little sister, priests of a darker gods nightmare
never enough, always wishing, the djinn in the bottle laughing
kneeling down tongue tasting the earth, her beauty grainy and bitter
13 step ladder across the ass the higher learning ecstacy of flesh
the smell of marsala wine salty with the bile of fear churning
the clock strikes twelve and starts over again, repeating history
dreams of immortal tombs long since lost to decay and blood
the temple doors falling inwards out comes the light of failure
a marching man against an army of fish from the lake of despair
a full mouth and enquiring mind with nothing to say words eaten

An image of you slips through my mind.
It has been a long since i have seen you
but not long as you live within me.
Sometimes I feel your gentle caress
and I do not know where you touched me
Inside or out.
Your voice whispers to me across ages
I wonder where you are right now.
are you dreaming me as I dream you
have you forgotten me or have i ceased to be
your smile catches me every time i doubt
I know you are listening and always hear me
Did i leave you or was it you who walked away
Falling or Dreaming.
I reach over and hope to find you there
next to me in my bed, sleeping softly
but i was right, or maybe wrong, I am alone
I no longer smell your scent of perfume in everything
i have given up waiting for you to come home
though my heart may wish you were standing here
it made me sick when you were home
Nausea and hysteria.
while i love you and loved you more than life.
i know that for true this one thing is certain
i can never let another do this to me again
the lesson i learned from my lovely time wiht you
all people betray and all will seek selfish right
your knife has made me that much stronger
when I decided to walk out of your life.
Sadly i still love you and I guess I always will
but your vicious tongue and ruthless mind
will keep me far apart from you.

you stuggle there bound and tied enjoying the forbidden
stimulated mind altered strength beyond the invisible dream

echoes of a former existence not aware the world spins
manipulated and controlled brainwashed minds herd slowly

Injustice. Coercion. Corruption. How many of you have heard of The Birmingham 6. not the Danish Industrial band, but the real Birmingham 6. They were railroaded in the ""united"" Kingdom because they were Irish. How many of you have heard of the Gilford 4? There was a movie about them called ""Name of the Father"" starring Daniel Day Lewis. Their entire family was railroaded and sent to prison because they were Irish. both are extremely good examples of corrupt justice systems. evidence does not have to exist, can be erased, and testimony and confessions coerced and beaten or tortured out of people. Not our problem? Leave that crap in England?

How many of you know about the West Memphis 3? 

Not England. Here. In the ""united"" States of America. This is a case of 3 teenage boys convicted without credible evidence and no physical evidence against them. In fact, alot of possibly key evidence is missing or was dismissed by the courts. Only fragments of a 12 hour interigation of one of the ""criminals"" is available... the one with a 72 IQ. and a baseball bat in the background. I urge you to go to the www.wm3.org website and read about this case. support them if you can. awareness is the key.

I brought this up because it really makes me sick. These things do happen in our country and around the world. Most americans are so blinded, so brainwashed, so lacking in the ability to think for themselves, that they NEED to be led. they need a shepherd. They are sheep. Personally i do not know many people like this myself, but I know they exist. My mother is a Masters Educator whom is extremely intelligent and strong. she has no conventional wisdom. she needs to be led.

unfortunately the ones doing the leading and not leading people for the sake of the people. they do it for their own benefit and gain. They play upon the peoples fears and call upon their faith in government and religon to meet their own ends. When these leaders have no desire to find the truth or for the truth to be known, then they develop their own truth. and the people shall follow where they should questions.

anyways, I will be purchasing tshirts and other materials to benefit the wm3 as I believe that justice can be had. It costs alot in some cases, financially, spiritually, physically. i think of the 10 years these kids have been tortured (and prison has been VERY unkind to them) and i, being a convicted felon at the end of a 13 year sentence, cannot begin to imagine what they are going through. They have strength that even i do not have. they still have hope. if my $25 purchase for shirts or whatever helps them get justice, if it helps bring the real sick fucks that did the crime to justice, if it brings closure and peace to 6 torn families, then I am more than willing to do it.

sometimes I guess, a small act can bring great results. Anyways, sorry for bringing this out here. Being very familiar with the justice system, prison, and the mental, spiritual, emotional and physical pain that comes from it, I would not wish it upon my worst enemy much less innocent people. please check it if you are interested. http://www.wm3.org

"event","Henry Rollins Spoken Word kicked ass. I have never actually gone to see Rollins do his spoken word before and i have to say I think it is something that everyone who is not a sheep or wearing blinders should see. I know most of my friends and associates have seen it so they know already. This was two and a half hours of Social, Political, and personal commentary by what i consider one of the most awake minds out there. 

check it out."

"event","once there was a man. he spent all of his life being one thing. what he was programmed to be. strong. in control. to crush internal weakness. dark. unyeilding. he lived this way for almost 20 years. strong in his power over himself. his control. his anger. his hatred of himself and his weakness.

this strength kept him whole and protected. He was never raped in prison. he has never killed. he could not hurt. his pain tolerance was almost at a divine level. he had honor and courage. he had vengeance and desire. he protected what he felt needed to be protected. he gave his strength to those around him. a knight. black knight.

then the day came where his world ended. his shield was cracked and broke. his heart was open and he let the good into him. he opened himself to the light. and like most people who never go into the light they get burned badly. the fires did not purify him. it burned away the paper that he wrapped himself in. he lost his sword and armor and he looked inside and faced his weakness.

from that day forward he was never again to be the same. the world was different when he could see it again. he could see those who stood against him. see their strength. all he had left was his honor. his purity. his loathing for himself. he opened a doorway and could not shut that door again. the paper was now ash and it just covered him in blackness. soot. the stabs penetrated him. his skin. his heart. his mind. his soul. he had no defense flailing his arms to ward off the blows. to no avail.

he did his best and ran away. he hid. he wore heavy clothing in the hopes that nobody would be able to recognize him.  to hide his scars. and in time he became safe again. closed. empty. without the hatred and anger he was defenseless. so he became invisible. over the years there were those who could see through his clothes. some he could escape. others he could not. always he did retreat. hiding. waiting.

he set standards for himself. impossible ones. too high for even him to reach. but he lived by those standards and hoped that others would meet those standards. some people did. most did not. they were not worth the time anyways. though this anti-paladin was dark he did have honor. and honor was all he had and all he wished to find in others. understanding. knowing. many a good friend did he find. and they accepted this darkness. they also saw the light behind the black clothing and soot.

so he sits now. waiting. watching. hoping. praying. stabbing his own heart. trying to kill his weakness. his light. his love. his expectations. his honor. the weight he bears. crying in the darkness for the strength that was once his. his complete apathy. looking for his sword and shield. to cool his molten heart back to stone. unswaying. unyeilding again. for the better? for the worse. the phoenix rising. the angel falling. the darkness calling. the light burning.

is it worth it all. is the pain worth it. is the loss worth it. is there nothing more than what there is. is there hope? has penance been finished. is there peace in emptiness.

I dont give a fuck. 39 more days. and i will live again."

"event","time slows down in the brief moments where life matters most.
or least.
sometimes that moment can stretch to almost an eternity.
sometimes that moment is months or years and lasts longer and longer
as each passing day or moment or time goes by.
what would you give to sleep those moments away.
the instances in time that have been hardest for you.
the waiting. the crawling. the screaming. would you sleep it away
i would like to take a nap from life. take a time to just not exist
to be outside of time. that timeless void of unconciousness.
to close my eyes and then open them again. a moment for me. years for the world
a coma? do you dream. does time still heal wounds even if you are not aware
i want to float above my body and look down. to see myself there but
to not be there. to be above or beyond. to be outside looking in
how else can i see myself except from inside this skin suit that i wear
the beauty i cannot see. from the walls. the prison. the silence.
my own voice distorted by the vibrations inside my structure.
to sleep or to float.

Damn i want this time to end. you would think that after all this time
after all that i have been put through. all that i have endured. after 13 years
that i could wait out these last several weeks.

but everyone that has waited for something in their life... its the last minutes,
the last moments. they stretch out forever.

countdown: 4753 days down. 40 days to go."

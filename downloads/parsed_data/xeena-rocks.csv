"event","so i was sitting here today with patty, looking at all our old lj entries n shit. i've come to the conclusion that i don't really know myself. i think i got hollowed out and replaced. i guess that's called growing, but i dunno...i'd rather just think that i'm some sort of like alien robot inhabiting the body of this boring humanoid. humans totally suck. fuck humans, and fuck all y'alls. if i had the energy, i would surely beat you. be-fuckin-ware.

hey, did you guys ever notice how monotonous and kind of boring life here on earth is? because it is. and you oughtta know it. also, cocks.

i'm looking at all my old entries, and i've come to realized something...leaving school has done me good. i feel like i have a better time expressing myself in writing. i don't know what connection that has to me leaving school, but there's one somewhere. maybe it's just because i read more. if only i understood the art of conversation, then i would REAAlly be able to say i know the english language. i don't have the right to say that at this point. i feel like a foreigner sometimes.

"event","it's so weird. all of us have really great opinions and a lot to say, but, other than on livejournal and myspace, we don't express them hardly ever. i wish we could all start a conversation that wasn't about drugs, or boys, or girls, or our crappy lives. i'm sure it could happen. there's so much potential, but it seems we're all too scared to get all this shit out in the open.

pretty lame if you ask me.

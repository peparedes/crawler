I'm sick ...

my refinance didn't go through because some idiot canceled it by mistake .. they would have to resubmit it .. another 45 days!!! I ended up calling keybank who is in charge of my checking accounts .. saving accounts .. cd's .. business checking accounts .. and my money market accounts (aka all my money shiat) ... and went through them rather than BANK of mo fo AMERICA!!! screw them .. damn fascist poopypants!! grrrrrr

good news is that I locked in at a lower rate with key though :-D YAY!!!

my head cold is so over powering ... I can't maintain a good attitude towards anything .. I have movies due back .. and I don't feel healthy enough to drive .. being all doped up on cold medicine ... hi I'm ben and I'm whining ..

oh right ... I saw a movie called <b>Priscilla queen of the desert</b> last night .. the movie was hilarious ... I got to see the guy known for saying ""mr. anderson"" in <b>drag</b> (that guy to the right) ! Oh and guy pearce was in it as well as a drag queen ... the movie was exactly what I wanted to see .. upbeat comedy about 3 drag queens who want to take a road trip .. yay! seriously it was good .. although I was so doped up on meds last night that it might of been fun to see paint dry too .... who knows ..."

I picked her up and we were off to fry's to get her a case for the computer I'm building her. We got there and I swear .. fry's is the disneyland for all the geeks out there .. I was super happy to walk in and see that huge screen with some racing video game on it.

8-0 WOW!!

Walking around with all the electronics' everywhere .. and all the toys .. I almost had an orgasm right there!! .. in fear I might scare brittyn I held back. 

anywho .. looking around I did not find a cheap case that she liked. I'm glad she came otherwise I would have picked something she probably wouldn't of liked. After looking at a lot of things that were not relevant towards her computer I noticed she wasn't having the fun I was at this electronic disneyland. So we escaped with the plan I would get all her computer parts from the internet. We then went to subway .. and brought the veggie delights back to my pad to watch the ring ....
<img src=""http://home.swipnet.se/~w-10972/ringufan/images/dutch_ring.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""250"" align=""left"" border=""2""></a><br>
mind you this is not the ring currently playing in the theatres .. this was the original <B>ringu</B> .. the Japanese flick that America cinema raped and made into a scream/i know what you did last summer. I didn't <b>hate</b> either but I have a lot more respect for the first japanese one. If anyone likes the american version I'd recommend <B>ringu</B>. very well done for the money it took to make it ... the movie ended and then we watched some other kids movie (hugga bunch) and I took her home ..

yesterday I went to my families and helped paint the house and went grocery shopping with my sissy. My mommy was nice enough to buy me what ever I wanted so I got all the expensive organic foods that are animal friendly. I am now officially vegan .. until I run out of this food and am forced to eat mac and cheese again .. hahah .. I'd be vegan if either my mommy bought me all my food .. or I was super rich with money to burn ... alas neither will happen for quite sometime ..

dolphins were on tv .. I could tell they were going to lose .. so I ran from my parents house and came home to see what was up with <lj user=loopedout>

good times were had by all last night with mr. buschkamp. His hospitality and super cool woman by his side entertained me and I had a great time .. afterwards I came home to soul caliber and ready 2 rumble on the dreamcast (thank you <lj user=jimmythebastard> and <lj user=magus2k2> for the games) and erin's new bf and I stayed up pretty late playing them .. I of course beat him .. :D

all in all a good freakin' weekend ..."

"event","tonight I helped <lj user=analyze> .. she was in desperate need of furniture and didn't have any money .. just so happens I have a lot collecting dust in my garage .. so I figured I'd just give it to her. I went over and picked her up in herb (my old black pickup I sold to my dad) and we were off to my house to get the furniture .. all together I was going to give her a desk .. 4 chairs .. a futon and a shelving unit. We got to my place and low and behold no one was there to help .. and the rain was pouring. We decided to wait and we watched the cell .. she hadn't seen it and I hadn't for awhile. I had forgot just how much eye candy was in this little film. Anywho .. the movie ended the rain stopped and both her and I loaded the truck with furniture and we were off ... we ended up dropping the furniture off at her pad .. I then went back to my parents house talked with my sissy for a bit .. and drove home.

I hope that furniture works out for you .. worse comes to worse just remember .. it was free :-P"

one of those nights last tonight .. where I can't sleep .. thankfully it was on a night where I don't have to work the next day .. last night I went and saw <a href=""http://bventertainment.go.com/movies/spiritedaway/index.html"">spirited away</a> with <lj user=magus2k2> and <lj user=loopedout>. overall a very well put together and written anime .. Hayao Miyazaki wrote it and directed it .. I was REALLY excited to see it due to his work on Princess Mononoke (by far my favorite anime) .. I wish erika was at fox tower so we didn't have to pay ... but regardless ... good times :D

when I worked at stream a few years ago I was placed on the 3com team. I quickly was placed on the mentor team and was in charge of click2chat (a chat program used to perform technical support) and the email queue. Another agent whom everyone disliked a little and was only promoted due to the hours he could work and who he knew shared this responsibility with me. I had to work twice as hard to make up for his slow incompetent ass .. anywho, I was outside a few days ago and guess who happens to walk out of the new hire training class .. yup, it was HIM. blah! .. so he comes up to me and asks me questions about how DTV is setup:

<img src=""http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9704/16/tech.support.nightmares/tech.support.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""3""></a></B>
<li> are they stats nazi's?
<li> how is the attendance setup? etc ....

basically questions to see if he could slack like he did at stream .. so I started to tell him that DTV really looks at your ACW time. ACW = After Call Work ... the time spent in between calls wrapping it up (i.e. finishing up notes, closing programs, etc.) .. the minute I finish telling him this he starts going off on me .. he says ""oh that's easy to get around .. once your customer is about to hang up on you and you say good bye you put them on hold .. wait a few minutes .. then put yourself in ACW for about a minute .. then take another call"" ... HAHAHA .. I simply laugh at this and walk upstairs.

mind you now I'm a supervisor and he still thinks I'm a tech .. or mentor like I was at stream ... so anyways I just received the names of my agents on my team  ... and guess who was on the list? ... um, that's right! the slacker is on my team .. 

he just came up to me a few minutes ago .. and was all quiet .. and shy and pretty much just said hi .. and ran off to his cube ... *insert evil maniacal laugh* .. he is SOOO going down!"

I'm excited!! how could anyone not like lord of the rings?? I posted a few months ago about this movie and someone from some movie community posted a comment saying lotr's sucked and that it was boring .. I tried to see how someone could not like it while watching it last night and couldn't figure it out Even if you don't like fantasy .. you have to think the directing style .. music, costume design .. acting .. I mean you have to think something is good .. for crying out loud .. k, I'm done.

this last weekend was a 3 day weekend for me :-O .. one of the first I've ever had at my job. I've been here 15 months? .. maybe longer .. I don't know .. seems longer .. anywho ... I didn't accomplish as much as I would have liked due to bad weather but remained a good boy and didn't drink .. a party was being held on Saturday night that I was invited to and had planned on going to .. I'm thankful that it slipped my mind till the last minute and couldn't find a ride or else I may of gotten myself in trouble .. I hear the party was fun and the name ""groper"" has been passed on from <lj user=ossuary> to <lj user=jimmythebastard> .


instead I kicked it with <lj user=analyze> saturday .. and then monday with <lj user=brittyn>
I think I am spending too much time on this live journal contraption .. finding cool people on it though ...

even more random thoughts .. going off on this post ..

 I realized today I've been single for .. 9+ months .. funny I haven't really thought about it until now. I find .. after the 6 month mark you get kind of numb to it .. and don't really care if you have that special someone or not. Since 8th grade year in junior high I've always been with someone it seems .. this is the longest I've gone without someone ... ironic due to I look better .. am more confident .. own a house .. cleaned up my act .. and I'm single now. When i was a complete mess I always had someone by my side. how the hell does that work out?

I need to go to my bank and give them my business license so I can get the account up correctly .. get this damn ever going home mortgage completed so I don't have to act so tight on cash .. and get the new roommate moved in ... :/


<lj user=loopedout> got me a Poo-pooing pig .. oh yeah! I love you!

I need to put top soil on the grass (or what is left of it) in my yard

my mommy made me vegetarian lasagna .. I didn't have much time to eat it so she let me take it home .. I'm good to go with food for the next week :D

going to see bruce campbell at the Hollywood Theatre on Sat Nov 2 @ 5pm ... to get my evil dead dvd signed .. with <lj user=feariebrat>

ALSO ...
new york to visit <lj user=arielastar> appears to be in the near future ... exact day is still in the air .. but I will go before I die!!!"

I saw delicatessen finally not last night .. but the night before. The eye candy from Jean-Pierre's movies was definitely apparent during this one. One of Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's first movies ... it reminded me of Dead Alive a little bit. <a href=""http://us.imdb.com/Title?0103873"">Dead Alive</a> was peter jackson's second movie ... both directors have a very distinct directing style. It feels almost like I'm reading a comic book during parts. <a href=""http://www.darkspin.com/""><B><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/157362408X.01.MZZZZZZZ.gif"" align=""left"" border=""3""></a></b>

Strange how a director from australia and a director from france could have the same eye for directing ...

During parts of delicatessen the sound and music were great . How the music, directing and acting all intertwined was pure genius. Delicatessen felt like a modern day charlie chaplin film due to the sound and acting at parts. Wish they had it on dvd in america though .. I had to break down and buy the vhs .. I'm sure the dvd sound quality and picture would bring the movie to another level ...

anywho ... both movies are very good in my opinion .. if you can handle gore ... and if you have an open mind, you might agree. be forewarned though they are both not your average movie ...

now i know how my parents felt after coming back from vacation after I just had a huge house party. I would never clean up after these parties completely and something was always broken ...

I woke up this morning .. took a shower .. threw on clothes .. went out to grab a diet coke .. and get ready for work and to my dismay the house was a complete mess! dirt from plant bowls all over the hardwood floors ... and some substance was spread out all along my carpet .. half awake .. half asleep I stumbled back into my room .. got ready and went to work wondering what the hell happened.

On my lunch I went home to clean and found that patches former owners care bag he gave me had a whole bag of cat nip in it .. which had been broken into and ripped apart ... the cat nip was spread all along the carpet and the dirt in my plant bowls had been replaced with kitty poo. :-O
seems my kitties decided to throw a cat party last night! Probably had to due with the new kitty and all 3 wanting to throw a party to invite him to the house ... while at first I was pissed this morning I couldn't help but laugh vacuuming up the cat nip and watching corbin roll around in the catnip and biting and scratching at thin air ... while I never had a party where people pooped in plant bowls .. *well only once* .. and people biting and scratching at things that aren't really there .. *hmmm .. actually I've had since that too* .. anywho ... I thought the similarities were quite hilarious ..."

*click on the pic to see my cat corbin and the new cat meet*
<BR>
we have a new cat at my house .. I just got back from picking it up ... this makes a grand total 3 ... I made the mistake as you can see by the pictures to bring the new cat in my room and lay down the new cats blanket. right away corbin goes for his blanket ... ok now you have one cat (corbin) who is jealous that a new cat (patches) is in HIS room ... and another cat (patches) jealous that the some strange cat (corbin)is on his blanket ... obviously this wasn't good .. I stopped taking pictures and rushed the new cat out of my room before a fight broke out ... wow my life is sooo exciting, eh?

I find cats are a wonderful substitute for a mate .. they have unconditional love and are always there when you need them. I think I will be perfectly happy in my house ... with 40 cats ... alone.

Darkspin (11:52:44 AM): I always kind of liked it .. when the domain was available 8 months ago ... I got it
Darkspin (11:52:57 AM): I asked him today if he still uses his aim name
Darkspin (11:53:07 AM): and he said no .. want it? ...
Darkspin (11:53:12 AM): good story ..

The accountant who is helping me start my buisness came over for the first time tonight. She took about an hour of her time to help explain things .. unfortunately now that she is gone I am more confused then ever. The company I started was wired4luxury, Inc. with Patrick the vice president .. me being the president. It's seems too confusing and stressful at the moment ... We have an S class coporation license (hence the Inc.)... and that's good for liability reasons .. this is about all I understand unfortunately .. does anyone know the difference between getting insured .. and getting bonded?? grrrr .. I guess we need to get bonded then get a tax id (which she is getting for me) and then .. with this tax id I need to call my bank and switch the buisness checking account I originally set up .. incorrectly :/

on top of this I need to make buisness cards .. get the website up .. get a CCB .. then get a low voltage license ... then ... if my head hasn't exploded from the confusing stress of starting this buisness .. start making money ... weeeeee

does the fun ever start? :/"

so today I accomplished a lot and the day is still young. I woke up and started doing yard work. I cleaned out the gutters, mowed the lawn and sprayed crossbow on the remainder of the tree's evil spawn's that have been uprooting. 

Tonight I'm going out to play drums in a band. I'm a little nervous .. because I haven't played for soooo long. I'm sure I'll do alright though ... The big challenge will be playing and not partaking in drinking and smoking afterwards .. should be interesting to see if I can do it. 

At Berklee ... which is where I really learned and played more then any other time in my life .. I was usually under the influence of any drug I could find when I wasn't going to school ... and on top of that I usually had a cigarette in my mouth while playing .. Berklee was an interesting college  ... can you imagine a college full of musicians jammed packed in dorm rooms??  I don't think there was a single person at that whole school who preferred to be sober :/"

Bruce Willis and Arnold Rifkin's Cheyenne Enterprises are near a deal with 20th Century Fox to bring yet another installment of the Die Hard franchise to the big screen, reports Variety.

The deal for Die Hard 4, details of which are being finalized, comes as the result of a title swap. Willis' latest project at Revolution Studios, directed by Antoine Fuqua, has gone through several monikers, including Tears of the Sun, but the studio and the producers wanted to call it ""Man of War."" That title, however, happened to be a Fox property. 

Fox agreed to hand over the ""War"" title if Cheyenne would commit to a fourth installment of the popular and lucrative ""Die Hard"" franchise. There is no writer on board for the next actioner."

I put my jack-o-lantern up in the house last weekend and bought a few pumpkins over at winco to carve today. yay! I love halloween ...

The biggest news about this halloween is Washington Square Cinemas (or at least what's left of it) is going to be a haunted house. I worked at Washington Square Cinemas for ~6 years as a movie theater projectionist .. up until they closed it. That place was like a second home to me .. and now they are turning my ... emphasis on MY projection booth and movie theater into a haunted house. I can't wait to see what they do to it. Only problem is I may run into X-employees and old friends I may not want to talk to ... :/

Halloween should be better then usual this year. The last few years I've been in an apartment and the trick or treat people are few and far between. My house is smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood full of kids now. It will be fun to stay up late watching scary movies and have plenty of little kids to scare =O."

anyone out there looking for a room in beavertron? it's HUGE .. and <b>very very nice</b>. 

A chance that another room mate may be taking this room though. This will open up a 350 dollars a month room ... anyways, pics of the house are at:

no pictures of the rooms are up yet though .. those will be up shortly ..

<li> pooltable
<li> home theater room
<li> security system
<li> 3 megs down and 384 up connection

I sit here alone in my house ... wondering where all my room mates are .. it's strange the fact not a single one is here now .. usually I have at least one here .. I wonder if they like living here sometimes ... honestly I worry ... if I lost every room mate I would be screwed ...  
I would have to sell the house  ... 

I bought the house for 180,000 .. I should be able to sell it for 200,000+ after all the work I have put into it .. but if I couldn't due to the crappy economy now .. I would be SCREWED .... Majorly :/ 

besides this constant worry in the back of my head .. I'm great ... today I went to movie madness with brittyn and rented <B>chopper</B> and <B>return to oz</B> .. I saw chopper tonight .. a decent flick overall .. the lead actor eric bana impressed me =) .... an independent movie coming from Australia that is decent ... is rather rare .. I recommend it .. first 30 minutes or so is rather slow but it gets better as it goes ... 

with ang lee and this boy eric bana at the front of hulk .. I'm rather excited ... perhaps a decent comic to movie story will arise ... 

daredevil will SUCK (quote me if you like) .. s'cuse me but kingpin is WHITE and ben affleck is the worst daredevil you could possibly pick!!! It's a good comic despite what hollywood will make of it .. :/"

Quite an interesting weekend to say the least .. definitely not my average weekend .. the vomit comet brought unexpected events to follow which led to an interesting next day.

Make matters worse my cell phone broke the same morning I lost my keys .. yay! .. luckily my keys were found much later in the day just in time to meet my parents and my sissy at olive garden for my sissy's 22nd b-day. A good dinner which consisted of no animal products what so ever .. and I was off .. back to my house for some R&R. 

A little yard work and spend most of today making a most impressive compilation of american psycho sound clips from the movie and downloading songs from the movie as well .. once I'm finished I should have a great cd .. let me know if you like the movie and want one .. =)

With work finished up I found a little free time at home to write something
in here. I enjoyed my vacation time tremendously. ""I did absolutely nothing
and it was everything I hoped it would be."" Actually I did accomplish a lot
but I didn't go anywhere special or do anything special. 

Plan to get out my drum set later this weekend and play some. I went out
with my family last night for my grandma's 79th b-day party ... my dad asked
me what I've been doing as far as music goes. He always backed me up and
thought I was a great drummer and pianist .. I haven't really even thought
about it for a good year and the only time I even picked up my drum sticks
between that time and now was to move it into the garage. Anyways, talking
with my dad about it got me pretty excited about getting back into it ... I
have a certification from Berklee College of Music currently residing in my
bedroom somewhere collecting dust, how fitting  :/

Looking forward to the weekend .. I have the ""Vomit Comet"" to go to Saturday
night .. and picking up an old friend <lj user=fulori> at the airport
Sunday."

"event","Don't take the bad days out on someone you know, take it out on someone you 
DON'T know. 
Now get this. I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I had to make. I found the number and dialed it. 
A man answered saying, ""Hello?"" 
I politely said, ""This is ******* and could I please speak to Robin Carter?"" 
Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude. I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. 
She had transposed the last two digits incorrectly. 
After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again. When the same person once more answered, I yelled 
""You're an asshole!"" and hung up. 
Next to his phone number I wrote the word ""asshole,"" and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up. He'd answer, and I'd yell, ""You're an asshole!"" 
It would always cheer me up. Later in the year the Phone Company introduced caller ID. 
This was a real setback for me; 
I would have to stop calling the asshole. 
Then one day I had an idea. I dialed his number and when I heard his voice, 
""Hello?"" I made up a name. 
""Hi. I'm with the Telephone Company and I'm just calling to see if you'd be interested in our caller ID program?"" 
""No!"" he shouted and slammed the phone down. 
I quickly called him back and said, ""That's because you're an asshole!"" 

(Keep reading this, it gets better!) 

An old lady at the shopping center really took her time pulling out of a parking space. I didn't think she was ever going to leave. 
Finally, her car began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the slot. I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out. 
""Great"", I thought, ""she's finally leaving."" 
All of a sudden this black BMW comes flying up the parking aisle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space. I hit the horn and started yelling, ""You can't do that. I was here first!"" 
The guy climbed out of his BMW completely ignoring me. He walked toward the shopping center as if I didn't even exist. 
I thought to myself, ""This guy's another asshole; there sure are a lot of assholes in this world."" 
Then, I noticed he had a ""For Sale"" sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the phone number. Then, I hunted for another place to park. 
A couple of days later, I'm sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling 823-4863 and yelling, ""You're an asshole!"" 
(It's really easy since I have his number on speed dial now.) 
I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black BMW there on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy, too. After a couple rings, someone answered the phone and said, ""Hello."" 
I said, ""Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?"" 
""Yes, it is."" 
""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" 
""Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street. 
It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front."" 
I said, ""What's your name?"" 
""My name is Don Hansen."" 
""When's a good time to catch you, Don?"" 
""I'm home in the evenings."" 
""Listen, Don, can I tell you something?"" 
""Sure..."" 
""Don, you're an asshole!"" 
And I slammed the phone down. 
Then, I added Don Hansen's number to my speed dialer. I must say, for a while things seemed to be going much better for me. Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. 
Then, after several months of calling the assholes and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. 
I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with this solution: 
First, I had my phone speed dial asshole #1. 
A man answered nicely, 
""Hello?"" I yelled, ""You're an asshole!"" 
but I didn't hang up. The asshole said, 
""Are you still there?"" 
I said, ""Yeah."" He said, ""Stop calling me."" 
I said, ""Make me"" asshole. He said, 
""What's your name, pal?"" 
So I told him, ""Don Hansen."" 
He said, ""Where do you live?"" 
I said, ""1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black BMW's parked out front."" 
""I'm coming over right now, Don. 
""You'd better start saying your prayers."" 
""Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole!"" 
and I hung up. 
Then I called asshole #2. 
Don Hansen answered, ""Hello?"" 
I said, ""Hello, asshole."" 
He said, ""If I ever find out who you are..."" 
""You'll what?"" 
""I'll kick your ass."" 
""Well, here's your chance. 
I'm coming over right now, asshole."" 
And I hung up. 
Then I picked up the phone and called the police. 
I told them I was on my way to 1802 West 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as I got there. 
Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going on down on West 34th Street. 
After that I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing. Glorious satisfaction! 
Watching two assholes kicking the crap out of each other in front of 6 squad cars, a police helicopter, and a news crew was one of the greatest experiences of my life! 
Now you know what to do if you have a really bad day!"

<li> closing costs
<li> appraisal for 202.000+ for the house

I know the house is worth it .... unfortunately a lot of work needs to be done on the outside for this to happen. If it does happen I'm looking at saving 200 - 300 more a month ...... all things considered that is a lot of money I can save in the long run .... *le sigh* ... not sure what to do though ... I made a note for the roommates of this house to come up with ideas for me ... I'm hoping that they will .. Any one know any good appraisers out there? :-/

I've been reading a lot of articles from this site today ... especially concerning Sept. 11th .... http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/911short.htm ... I'm rather in the mood to be upset and stressed at everything at the moment :("

weeeeeee ...
back to work after 5 days off and everything went down today! yay!
consitent 40+ calls on hold .. I have IVR's up but most of the customers are going through the default queue *le sigh*

must talk about something else while I am on lunch ... must not think about work ..

ok, last night was fun .. my sissy Emily came over and brought I am Sam .. and Species 1 and 2 to watch. It was fun to watch a movie alone with my sister. We only had time to watch one movie ... so obviously I went for I am Sam. A good movie .. it reminded me too much of other movies that have touched on issues simliar to it though. While Sean Penn and Michelle did a great job I felt bored through some parts. I cared about the characters but something was lacking .. still can't place my finger on what though ..

so after the movie my sister was going to take me to my mom's car to take back to the house (I had been driving it around since my jetta was in the shop) Right before we left <lj user = 041277> aimed me with .. we need a plunger .. bring us a plunger! mmhmmm .. an interesting request at 1am but me being the nice guy that I am decided I would go over to help them out rather then taking the car back. A backed up toilet isn't much fun ... so I arrived and helped her and her roomie ... got home late and woke up early .. another fun day!"

Erin gave me a haircut tonight. it's quite short now, but it looks REAL good. I'm even surprised ... and it takes a lot to surprise me when it comes to stuff like that. so far my vacation has been uneventful. I've done a lot of things on my list so far though.

last night I was online .. chatting away, updating a spreadsheet for work and listening to mp3s when suddenly the power went out. At first I didn't panic .. I thought to myself that it wasn't an emergency .. I grabbed a flashlight and headed off to the garage to check the circuit breakers. Flipping everything off and turning everything back on resolved the issue. with a deep sigh I continued back to my room to get online. This little incident happened twice more ... last night ... finally the circuit breakers would not turn on at all. 

*Panic now sets in*

Oh dear god! no internet?!? no mp3s?!? no electricity?!? whatever should I do?

After I calmed down I thought to myself what can I do without these modern devices I took for granted .. it took me way too long to think of something to do .. kind of scary how dependant I am on technology :-/

Well, I ended up grabbing a book by Kurt Vonnegut and with a candle by my side I read all night long. In the end I'm glad this happened ... I forgot just how entertaining books can be ... it's one thing reading online ... it's completely different to read from a tangible book.

anywho .. he mentioned to me earlier today how proud he was that I've shacked the ""alcoholism monster"". Strangely enough I haven't drank for quite sometime .. I hadn't been thinking about it really .. I now realize I had planned on drinking once the 102 days was up .. but I'm still going strong and don't feel like I even want to drink .. yay! I must be at least 1/3 of a year now .. and I'm not even trying. Not drinking at all mainly due to a new friend who is a sexy rockstar <lj user=""brittyn""> who keeps me glued to AIM+/Trillian for a good portion of the night, and the fact I have anime and new movies thanks to <lj user=""teknotus"">

On another note we have a Company Bar-B-Que today ... um yeah .. hi, my name is Ben and I'm a vegetarian!!! I went downstairs to see what they had for people like me .. they have lettuce ... unfortunately it was smeared on a hamburger .. jokingly an employee of mine placed a piece of lettuce covered with meat sauce on a plate for me .. I think I'll be eating at Baja today =P"

"event","oh goodness .. I think I came down with something! I had caffeine and nothing else today for breakfast lunch and dinner. By the time 5pm rolled around I was pretty sick to my stomach. I had to do a bunch of things too. I had planned to go take back the movie Quills, then swing by Rin's place to lend her rejected .. watch it and perhaps another movie. Then pay bills and drop my Jetta off at the shop ... Instead I dropped the movie off and came straight home. I passed out soooo quick and was out till about 8:30pm. I dragged myself out of bed so I could make it to Rin's ... I knew if I didn't I'd be facing hell the next day ... brimestones and all .. yeah have you seen Rin angry? .. yeah, not a pretty site =P

anywho now I'm starting to feel better .. I cleaned the house dramatically jumped in the hot tub .. took a shower ... paid some bills ... and I'm about 85% ... MUCH better then the 2 % when I got home .. oh I also picked up some rice milk from the store .. it's helping my throut ... tastes kinda like poo though :-/

Yes I am easily amused this morning. I am at work on a small break from all my one on ones. I'm finding agents on the floor are not as disgruntled as I thought they were. Perhaps it is because I am their boss and I have a team of no whiners ... but either way so far I am amazed ..

About 2 years ago I put a 166 MHz computer together and sold it for more then it was worth to a guy that didn't know much about computers. I've always felt guilty about this but like any feeling you don't like you push it inside you so far back that you forget about it eventually. Anywho, he called me a few days ago. Out of the BLUE! I was shocked ... I decided I must rectify the past decision I made a few years ago. So I put a computer together for him ... a nice 800 dollar one ... and I think I'm going to give it to him for free. I asked a roommate last night if this too nice ... and I asked him would he do this? ... he responded with you are too nice.  He said he would never do this .. It's been 2 years and now this guy is complaining ... tell him to deal with it ... 

I don't know .. perhaps I believe in fate .. or something of this sort ... I think I must redeem myself now that I have the chance."

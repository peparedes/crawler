"event","<center> Last night I decided I wanted to tell you that you
have a really good boyfriend.  We are always talking
bad about Nate, how he is not responsible or how he
doesn't shower sometimes or how he only listens to
hardcore.  I know you don't care what we say but I
still just wanted to say that he is really cool. 
Nothing special happened last night.  I just gave him
a ride, but I realised how much he cares about you.  I
hope I have a b/f that leaves longs voice messages
saying ""i like you alot"" about 10 times.  You have got
to feel so good.  Oh, I also don't want you to think
that I want Nate,  I just want someone who has a few
good characteristic that Nate has.  Yeah, so I hope
this email doesn't make you feel weird.   Oh and you
don't have to respond.  Yeah.  SO, you picked a
winner.

This just made me realize how much of a bliss i have been living in bf wise for the past few months. i never thought i could be best friends with a boy but i think thats what this has evolved into. i love his presense even if im around him all the time. i love talking to him even if its mindless babble that would make no sense to a passer by. i guess im realizing how much i care too and my world wouldnt be nearly as happy without him."

i want to go home atleast there i feel wanted.
maybe i will just live at home till i finish college, then i could save up more money. sometimes i wish i did move to oklahoma. it would have pushed me out of my comfort zone so that i would have had to do things on my own.

"event","so i could tell the mood of the week was going to change by the difference i felt when i woke up this morning. It was cloudy and rainy and crappy outside but i didnt feel that way inside anymore. i awoke to the phone ringing, then my cell rang and luckily keely got if for me cause it was allen calling and saying that i didnt have to come into work till 12. this made me happy. so i kept keely up talking random sentences all morning. i dont know i get like that sometimes but i know she had to have enjoyed it. ha yeah right. 
so i get to work and they are getting their butts kicked, for some reason there was a rush for cheese frenches today... must be the warm gooey cheese in the center after a rainy dreary day. 
But yeah i get back and just chill and max and relax and then brian comes over to get chicken soft tacos and i wasnt expecting nate then he walks in. it was a little weird, especially when everyone left but then we started talking finally and i told him what the deal was and i was like do you understand, and he was like im an dumbass and then i was afraid he was gonna start crying. i was like awwwww... no and gave him a hug. i think he is way to hard on himself. it was just nice to know that he has feelings and stuff affects him. it was just nice to know that he got that i wasnt happy about this and hes gonna make an effort to change. thats all that really matters. 
uh saw mr 1986 and they were fricken AWESOME!!!"

"event","hi world. i hope your doing better than i am this crappy CRAPPY week. Today has been sucky, the day before that was sucky and the day before that was even suckier, therefore there is not much hope for tomorrow. i guess the only good part of my week was not have to work for the past 2 days but its not like any of that time went to anything productive or even good. i guess you can see where im going with this. i still havent talk to nate about anything in person, he just always seems to be doing something, maybe this is a sign... but yeah, i sent him and email last night saying all of what was bothering me last night when he came over and me and my childish ways just decided to ignore him. i know it was really awkward for him since i know he doesnt like silence and all but its all i could do to keep myself from acting like everything was okay or making it more awkward by having keely walk in in the middle of it. this week is just sad. and as far as a talk goes, theres really no hope... i work, he works, and does whatever the hell he does. yeah. i wonder if i wrote a really mean email to him cause the one he wrote back to me it seemed like he was on the defense. maybe i should refrain from writing emails at 4 in the morning. 


today sucked. that is the jist of it.

i guess when someone says hey lets hang out it doesnt mean at like 2 o clock in the morning.... when you wonder where someone is and they are on your floor but talking to your RA for 3 hrs or so..... am i supposed to wait around? 
no thanks,... sorry maybe im blowing this out of purportion... im just annoyed..... i guess there has been other stuff feeding to it too.

This makes me incredibly sad. i dont see how someone could feel so unloved and so worthless that they would take away their life. i dont know. in a way it makes me feel like a failure being around him, (even though i wasnt around him much), that i couldnt be that light to make him realize all there is in the world and gods love.  i dont know how i could have done it, but i just wish i could have helped before he got to this point. in a lot of ways he reminds me of my sister, it seems like he keeps his emotions all bottled up and is quiet. its sad.
pray for him.

its spring break. it seems like everyone is out of town. oh well. its nice to be alone and i havent worked very much lately and i need the mulah.
went to the cursive concert in omahole at sokol on saturday.. that ruled EVERYONE. i love cursive. i wish there were more bands like them but then i guess it wouldnt make them them. i dont remember tim kasher being the young guy. i was watching waiting for the other guy to sing then i realized his voice was coming out the other guy. i felt stupid. desparicidos also played, they were pretty good. i really didnt know what their music sounded like before that. bright eyes is more countrish and experimental.. i like both. i wish i could go to more good concert, not so many hardcore concerts but i have to be supportive. i need to find more good music in this general area. 
any suggestions?"

  beneathburningskies.com says:
i think my problem is that i'm unequally yoked. that is saying that i have no accountablity partners that are christians and yet have friends that dont believe in christ.
  beneathburningskies.com says:
like in the past i had a ton of friends that dont believe in CHrist but at the same time i had my time with GOd and fellowship so that way i could not be influence by society like am now. ...emily i totally understand

i think i have come to the conclusion that im just lazy....

and i need to snap   out of it
  beneathburningskies.com says:
it would be nice to live in a bliss
  beneathburningskies.com says:
i know i'm talking to amand that girl from seattle and we figured out that  because she has so much persicution from her parents that she has to talk to and thing about Christ all the time to stay on top of things
  beneathburningskies.com says:
were as me being free from persicutions i become lazy in my faith
  not so much says:
yeah... i dont know..
  not so much says:
i guess i just find it so hard cause there are no clear set rules. you have to interpret it how you feel it applies to you. in which it may not be the same to everyone
  not so much says:
yeah that must be difficult for her
  beneathburningskies.com says:
not entirly true. there are some clear cut things in the bible we just dont read into them as deep as we should( thats what i 've come to the conclusion that is)
  beneathburningskies.com says:
it is but i think she doing really good 
  not so much says:
yeah but i dont know...
  beneathburningskies.com says:
i dont either but since i've been analizing my heart tonight God has been giving me a lot insight, truth(harsh truth about myself) and revealing a lot to me 
  not so much says:
good
  beneathburningskies.com says:
and when we sit down together, in person, i can share to you what he's been revealing to me. 
  not so much says:
k sounds good

  not so much says:
i dont know.. i just dont feel as though im knowlege about anything
  beneathburningskies.com says:
dude i'm not either, but we can learn together if you want
  not so much says:
see thats the thing.. i dont know how to go about doing it sometimes cause im like i try to read my bible and its like nothing sticks, kinda like when your reading a book and you zone out and realized you read a whole page that way but i try to pay attention but get nothing out of it. i dont know.. its hard for me to analyze and understand a lot of it
  beneathburningskies.com says:
your not the only one, it happens to me to
  beneathburningskies.com says:
this is what i do when that happens
  beneathburningskies.com says:
i either stop adn ask GOd to help me to stay focused or i go to another part of the bible and read that
  beneathburningskies.com says:
if you want to know how my reading time goes i'll tellyou 
  beneathburningskies.com says:
and how i do it
  not so much says:
k
  beneathburningskies.com says:
well i sit down and thank GOd for the time that i have to learn about him and i ask him to help me learn and to give me insite in what i'm about to read
  beneathburningskies.com says:
then i read. right now i'm in the the book of 1st Corintians. i read either chapter or less thatn that. depends on how much i understand or dont.( but on thing  i find is that the more i read other books of the bible. the parts i didnt understand before make sense as a bigger picture
  beneathburningskies.com says:
)
not so much says:
yeah
  beneathburningskies.com says:
then after that i pray. talking to God. i will ask for forgiveness for my sins by name (example lust or pride , ect) than i thank him for his love and grace for putting up with me.
  beneathburningskies.com says:
i praise him for his holyness
  beneathburningskies.com says:
i pray for the people i care about my friends, you, other people that they would grow in theire relationship with christ
  beneathburningskies.com says:
than i pray for the salvation of people that i know, sometimes by name sometimes not.
  beneathburningskies.com says:
and i thank God for the blessings i have
  beneathburningskies.com says:
sometimes that final prayer can be 10mins long or 20minuest long it depends on how much i talk to GOd
  beneathburningskies.com says:
the more i invest the more i get out of it
  beneathburningskies.com says:
i try to do that everyday but as you know i dont
  beneathburningskies.com says:
sorry if that was long ....i talk to much
  not so much says:
yeah... no

  not so much says:
not at all . im soo..  happy that i can talk to you about stuff like this cause coming from the family i come from and what not i dont know, its just not easy to talk about with many people, i guess i have learned to suppress my feelings and what not cause i get embarassed really easily as you know and cover it up with smart ass remarks and now they are just taking over my life.. AHHH.. ha
  beneathburningskies.com says:
dude i'm glad i can talk to you about this to because right now the only other person i have (and its been resently that we set this up ) is kyle failure adn thats my email. 
  beneathburningskies.com says:
i know all about supressing feelings like i said to you before i dont know how to show my love to my family , friends, adn you sometimes..
  not so much says:
yeah






I  know that does mean a lot to you folk, but its my journal... deal. 
i guess it just shows that i have grow towards a person in a way that i never though i would beable too and its not something i want to give up but if im distracting him and myself away from the purpose of our lives, living in the way of christ... then maybe this isnt the best for us at this time in our lives. i mean, if its to happen it will...."

anyways i just think its funny that its only 10 o clock and im already up eating ramen noodle. its kinda rules in a way. i will be going to my class today and i will be going to class wide awake. this is great especially since i have a midterm on thursday and i feel like i havent learned one damn thing..,..
i dont like school much. i just wish i knew why i was here.

um... in other new... today will be great because it is sunny out!!!
maybe thats why im so wide awake!
im going to open the shades now!
yeah for sun. except that i can barely see the computer screen right now... but who needs that? i think not.

yesterday we went to yaiyai's. it was okay. i think nate gets a little clingy sometimes. i mean i would have enjoyed conversing with other souls but couldnt really do that. dont get me wrong i love spending time with him but i think it just makes other people uncomfortable sometimes especially when in a setting like that and i couldnt get away if my life depended on it. ha. okay so it wasnt that bad. i guess i just realized that this is something im gonna have to converse with him about since he tends to not see the obvious a lot of the time. i hate making people feel uncomfortable or awkward because of that... i guess i could see how it could get really annoying and i dont want it to get to the point where they dont want to hang out with us because of that. its just weird to think that the obvious to me may not be the obvious to him.....

all in all it will be a fantastic day!!!

as far as other things. i dont want to care what other people think. yet as much as i dont want to, i always do. its really annoying when the ones that are the closest to you are the ones who are always judgeing and if feels as if no matter how hard you try you cant be good enough.  I just dont see the point in analyzing something so much that all the joy and happiness is taken out of it because all confidence is gone by way of the crapper.  its like other people have to make you feel crappy cause they arent happy and it makes them feel better to bring you down with them.  Im sick of trying to please everyone.  Cant we just let things be and see how things work out in the end, i mean things arent always as they seem. through all of this i feel as though im getting ripped away from the one person that i feel closest to right now and thats definately the opposite of what i want to happen. but then maybe its not what i want to happen, but then its not about what they want to happen.. grr... i know im not being very clear. 
but... 
thats just the way its gonna stay cause thats the way it is in my head...
i wish for once in my life i could just be sure about something.

as much as i am judged, im gonna live my life for me, not them..."

i think its cause i dont have my alone time anymore. i miss being able to sit around and do nothing for hours and its only been two days. 
maybe im just in a bad mood. maybe i should go to bed. honestly all i want to do right now is shot myself in the head. i cant express myself to the people i care about most the way i want to and its screwing with my life. i think im gonna cry..."

so we went to his friends photo show and then he took me out to eat at vincenzo's. it was good. hehe. my mom was like aww i wish your dad would do that for me. then at 230 we were gonna go watch the meteor shower but uh we never really made it outside. it was sooo.. cold and after walkiing in my dress for likewhat seemed like a million blocks and finally thawing out i didnt want to go back out. although when he was taking me home we did see one. it was cool. but yeah. it was sweet of him.

you know what else is  crappy? i wont know if i actually live in the dorms till the first week in january. THIS SUCKS! for all that dont know classes start on the 13th so... you get the picture. i would shoot myself if i didnt get in the dorms which im almost positive i will. i dont think i could deal with living at home anymore. i for sure would go live in a box or the sewer or something.. would anyone adopt me? i promise to bake cookies.

its okay i wouldnt want to adopt me if i werent me.. hmm that makes lots of sense... yeah
did i mention that i have to get up early and get my brakes fixed.. so maybe i should hit the hay

the day started off me getting up at um.. 8 cause i had to work at 930. not really sure why i woke up then but i did. work wasnt too bad. it was slow and that was nice. got off at like 115. and came home and cleaned my room and hung out and what not. then nate called me around three something and we ended up talking for a while. i ended up going to  a christianity vs antheism debate. it was interesting. im still not really sure what i think about it. then after that we ended up going to jimmy johns.. yumm.. i love thier wheat bread. but yeah then we (aka nate, miriam, steve-o, brian and i) proceeded back to the dorms where we all parted but i ended up hanging out with nate. of course he had to pick his fro out before we left but yeah. went to block buster and picked up monsters inc.. great movie by the way... bo is soooo cute... and then came to my house. watched that and shrek. i love that movie too. my parents are dumb. if i wanted to have sex i would have by now.. but anywho.. haha...
oh the way home nate was like so yeah i have something to ask you.. do you want to go out with me.. hahaha. it made me laugh cause it was so like 7th grade and of course i was like... k. and made him feel stupid which i really didnt mean to do but uh its not like we basically havent been together for like the past two weeks or so.  so yeah.. i guess now we are now officially boyfriend and girlfriend.  i dont mind being commited to someone but i dont enjoy those terms. eh...

we would really like to party with you on friday...  we have a friend that see you and though you were hotttttt so just call and if he doesnt answer leave a voice mail and will call back. love ya.
haha yeah that would be it word for word.
god guys are cool. did you know calling a girl hot and hitting at her in the amigos drive through doesnt usually promise a future... ha. but it did make my night.  it also made my night that it was so slow. and that i got out in 20 min and that nate called me.

Flurry of activity. 
-Original score composer left, tentatively replaced, replaced again and finally passed on to the capable hands of Dave Castillo aka Sketch. 
-Editing complete.
-All other post halted until further notice. 
-Project will not be considered ready until at least Summer/Fall of 2006.

Future work:
Basis: Mi and L'au - A Word in Your Belly.


Updating project progress is like counting your chickens before they hatch, I advise you avoid it all costs."

"event","Shooting wrapped today in a field in Indiana. 
I would like to extend my thanks to the cast and crew who have done a phenomenal job, the footage we have looks far better than anything I had hoped. 
Now the editing and sound will be done in Peoria under the tutelage of Justin Russo and Braden Rapp.

Justin, Don, and myself have formed a production company: <b>granola,ok</b>

tapedeckghost will remain for even more independent works."

"event","What can only be described as a busy semester and devastating family crises held back all progress on the aforementioned zombie project.  As of a few weeks ago, a script was written (from the first idea I had for the film festival of 2004) and edited by Justin Russo and Don Steiner.  The three of us have formed a collective and are producing the film titled <i>Pale Horse</i>.  Maggie will be doing lighting and make up effects, Justin and I will share director/cinematography responsiblities.  Andy, Phil, and Kiel will star and Don will be on hand to be Don and help out.  Braden Rapp will hopefully be joining me in recording and engineering the sound/score.  Shooting has been tentatively scheduled for the fifeenth of August.  I will be doing storyboards starting tomorrow.  Post production/editing will hopefully be completed by August 19th by Justin and myself at which point I will leave for Peoria for fall semester and start on sound with Braden.  

Brief Overview:
This film takes a look at the final hours of three strangers who have barricaded themselves in a small basement.  The threat outside mounts and the situation quickly worsens leading to complete chaos.  

As a side note, my intention was for this film to be heavy in audio effects and have it take a different approach to how sound is incorporated and used.  A second film, barely in the brainstorming stage, will be lush with visuals and will eventually be coupled with <i>Pale Horse</i> to create a very nice aural/visual experience."

Back on track!
Get excited and be ready for Untitled Zombie Project #01. I just have to butter up some prospective equipment lenders and financers. If it goes well, next week will be the week to start.
Fingers Crossed!"

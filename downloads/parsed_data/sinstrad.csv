"event","I guess I haven't written in ages.  I see the last entry was Jan/04.  A lot has happened anywyay.  I've finished school <throws arms up in the air> ""yay"".  I've moved up with Ryan in Ottawa while I look for a job.  I'm hoping to get something very soon so I can make some money and start my career.

Reflecting back...
Graduating from college was something I looked forward to my whole life but now that it has happened I wish I could go back.  After graduating highschool I left for college without much thought.  I haven't kept in contact with all my friends from highschool and we weren't really that close even though we went to school together for at least 4 years.  After leaving college howerver, just after 3 years I didn't want to leave all the new friends I made.  I was much closer with my classmates, mostly because everybody was in the same situation of not knowing anyone.  Throughout the program we worked together, were in the same classes all day, and we were all going through the same heavy workload that we everyone really got to know one another.  I guess I just miss everyone I went to college with and I can't wait to see them all again at the graduation ceremony.  Is there college reunions?

Anyways college life is great and enjoy it.
Cheers!"

"event","No classes on Tuesdays, prof was absent today for our lab today (no classes again).  2 days off and tomorrow is Thursday, not a bad week at all.

Had to give a presentation on our final projects about what we plan to do and what progress we have made during the week.  Had 2 of our teachers evaluating us while we presented to the class.  Received the comments the teachers made about the presentations in general (6 groups).  The comments are 4 pages typed, single spaced first comment is all the marks are low from 3-6 out of 10.  Profs noted they're trying to make us work harder and give better presentations since giving 8's and over leave little room for improvement.

Went to the gym again this evening.  Had fun but shoulders are still a little sore.  I plan to be rough and tough by April.  I feel better and stronger but I plan to show results as well.  Using the ab machine everyday to tone up the stomach area as well =D.

Not much else to report on at the moment, I'll add more when I think of it.

Thinking of all of you,"

"event","Well school is back and the fist week is quickly drawing to a close.  Had my first class for the day at 11:30-12:30 and second 3:30-5:30.  I decided I'd pick up the gym workout again so went during the 3 hour break in between classes.

I was going frequently throughout the week last semester until school got in the way but hopefully with the reduced number of class hours I can keep up going everyday most weeks.  After working out on one of the eleptical trainers (spelling but meh) my legs felt extremely heavy but kept it up for the 25 minutes.  Spent time on the rowing machine and other leg exercise machines.  I pushed myself a little more than I should have on one machine and I fear I may be in some discomfort tomorrow when I wake up.  I really enjoyed and felt great when working out at the gym but starting back up after taking some time off isn't fun.

I won't let school get in the way again so I can workout and feel better than I ever have before.  Working on the upper body tomorrow so we'll see how much I can type tomorrow night since today was a little rough.  It'll get better after a week of steady exercise so it's all good.

I'll check everyone elses journal to see what they've been up to the past couple days.
Cheers!"

School starts in a couple days <sigh> but graduating in April so that's something to look forward to.

Been a fun week and the good times will continue. <Raises a glass> Cheers!"

"event","Well it's almost christmas time and already I can barely sleep at night.

I see others have made these ""blogs"" and figured I'd jump in while the going was good and use it as a place to inform friends about what's been going on, what irritates me, or just a place to waste some time.

I'll write more later but thought I'd start this up and will continue to play with it."

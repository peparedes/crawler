things are good.
i'm working at outback now as a hostess

other than that
i did a lot of drinking this week.
went to a clippers game with my dad, brother and jake.
worked a lot.
tonight i just made dinner and relaxed.
i have to work all day tomorrow.

i hate having a period.
it makes me grouchy.

i'm in a cuddle mood.

and i don't like change.
and i can be selfish.
what can i say?

that's a rhetorical question however.

anyway folks,
i have to work pretty much all day tomorrow
from 9:30 til 2
and from 4:30 until who knows when.
so peace out.

I am so happy.
I can't even explain it.
Jake is more wonderful than I thought he could ever be.
My whole family <b>loves</b> him.
and I can't wait to meet his family
and Christmas is coming
and I feel like nothing can go wrong.
I feel like I regained all the happiest that was sucked out of me.

Last night
Jake and I went to the USC game
and I met 2 of his friends
and they were just as fabulous as my own.
and jake has a life
and a job
and a car
and he's graduating college soon
and he has a dream.
He's everything I've ever wanted.
I feel so safe with him.
He held me while I slept
and took care of me when I got sick
and carried me
and was everything a boyfriend should be.
I'm not letting this one go.

finally
everything is the way it should be with me.
I can't wait for Christmas.
Jakey and I are going to go to Disneyland
and he's going to buy a pass
and we're going to look at the lights
and watch all my favorite movies
and be happy together.
God
he makes me such a happy girl.
I could go on forever about him.
I haven't ever felt this good.
Kenny never made me feel like this.
No one has ever made me feel like this.
I know he won't hurt me.
He doesn't hide anything from me.
He takes care of me.
he's absolutely the best guy ever.
and he's all mine.

anyway,
now I really need to do my homework.
hope everyone is just as happy as me.
I love you all at this very moment.
peace."

Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you
Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you

And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two do you?

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you."

I think about what would things be like
if I hadn't acted that way that night
or if I had been different
If I had taken him home
or if he had never sent so much time at my house.

I wonder if I had said something different
the right thing,
would he be here with me?
If I had been braver, wiser, stronger.
All the ""what if's"" kill me.

What if he had never gotten fired?
What if he never painted my house?
What if I hadn't acted so stupid?
What if I wasn't me?
What if I was better?

Why can't I be right for him?
Why did he lie to me?
Why did he lead me on?
Why didn't he love me?
Was it all just a lie?
Why can't I see the truth?
Why do I always have to get my heart broken?
Why can't love be easy?

I wish I had answers. 
I wish I could forget everything.
Like in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".
I would erase him.
in a second.
This is way too much pain 
for a stupid 3 month relationship. 
But he was the first to love me in soooo long
To make me feel alive again.
And now I feel dead inside.
I feel left behind.
I feel like I never want to love ever again.

I did everything for him.
I gave him my everything.
I guess that's not good enough.

my heart was shattered.
I've picked up a lot of the pieces.
But My hearts not whole,
and it's only being held together with tape.
I need glue.
I need to heal.
I don't know what I need,
maybe just time.
Time heals most, if not all, wounds.
If this is true,
I wish it was next year.
Then I'd be ok.
hopefully.

I just felt the need to let some stuff out right now.
everyone thinks I'm ok.
Most of the time I am.
But I hate to see that I'm the only one hurt by this.
He's out fucking some bro hoe,
and I'm here,
holding the pieces of my broken heart,
hoping someone will help me put it back together.

men suck.
love sucks.
that's all my thoughts for right now."

That's how I felt today.

the day really started out ok.
I was driving home,

and I was jamming,
and everything was right in the world for about a minute.

and then I thought about him,
and my heart started to crack again.
I'm trying to pick up the pieces,
but it's hard.
I still dream about him.
I still have a slight bit of hope in my heart for him.
but I'm not holding out.

whatever I guess.
I haven't been sitting at home.
I went out all weekend and this week too.

However, I'll do it in such a way that you won't be able to tell which person corresponds with what I said. If you're on the list, you'll have to guess which point is directed at you. But, I'll be able to get it all out in the open. Sound like fun?! Okay, good.

-You are so great.  You are always so supportive and open and sweet.  You are like a ray of sunshine.  I appreciate everything you've helped me with.

-I'm sorry for all the bitchy times.  Sucks. I can't take it back.  I'm going to miss you.

-I hate you.  You fucking pull all this bullshit and you expect me to forgive you? That's it.  As far as I'm concerned, I never want to speak to you again.  All you do is lie and act like an asshole.  You can fucking stick it where the sun doesn't shine because I'm tired of hearing your bullshit excuses.

-I'll miss you, but we're not as close as we once were.  Thanks for listening to me all those times, but you'll be fine where ever you go.  But I'm not going to miss you judging me.  It was a nice thought, but it bugs me.

-We're blood. That's it.  No matter where you go in life, i'll always be there. duh.

-You are wonderful.  I'm so glad I found you.  We're happy, and that's what matters.

-I love you.  You have been there for me always.  I hope we never lose touch.  You are going to be at my wedding.  I hope everything works out.  You deserve soooo much and I want to give it to you.  I wish I could.

-I hope we hang out more over the next year.  You're fun and cool.  

-I'm going to miss you.  Hopefully we won't lose touch.    You're cute and you're worth more than any dumb boys that can't see what a hottie you are.

-I don't know if you think i've changed, because I haven't.  I've always been the same.  You've never judged me and I love you everyday for that.  We may lose touch, but I hope that doesn't happen.  and I know this sounds corny, but if we try, we will probably still keep in contact. i want to come visit you.  thanks for everything.

Sang karaoke with Cale,
got a tattoo,
went down the slide with Alia,
went on the maze with Cale,

burned my boobs.
Had subway.

did some errands,
feel asleep.

Anyway,
This weekend was pretty good.
Saturday I slept in until 12,
and had to go straight to Baccalaureate.
I really thought I would cry, but I didn't.
But I was scared shitless.
Singing went really good and went to reception.
Then went and saw Star Wars 3 again.
Ate dinner at Red Robbin, and walked like a million miles to my car.
But it was fabulous.
Then went to Frank's.
Played Life and got yelled at.
Sat outside and looked at the stars.
Then went to bed finally.
Woke up, hungover.
Went home and slept.
Washed my car.
Then went to my Aunt Michelle's house.
Ate and did the family thing.
Went to work.
Slow, but I got bread pudding, so that makes up.
Hung with the co workers for a bit.
Came home.

I have so many feelings and emotions inside,
and they keep conflicting and overlapping.
I'm kind of at a loss at what to do.
Everything I do will hurt someone else,
and I can't be mean,
but then I can't be someone I'm not,
and I have to be true to myself in the end.
Dear Lord.
What have I got myself into?
But I'm just going to sit back and enjoy my life 
and my last 3 days of high school.
Peace out guys."

teachers dont keep track of it

i used to be the tight one
the perfect fit
funny how those compliments can
make you feel so full of it

i can shuffle cut and deal
but i can't draw a hand
i can't draw a lot of things
i hope you understand 
i'm not exceptionally shy
but i've never had a man
that i could look straight in the eye 
and tell my secret plans

i can take a vow
and i can wear a ring 
and i can make you promises but 
they won't mean a thing

can't you do it for me, i'll pay you well
fuck i'll pay you anything if you could end this

can't you just fix it for me, it's gone berserk...
fuck i'll give you anything if 
you can make the damn thing work

can't you just fix it for me, ill pay you well,
fuck ill pay you anything 
if you can end this 
hello, i love you will you tell me your name?
hello, i'm good for nothing - will you love me just the same?</i></lj-cut>"

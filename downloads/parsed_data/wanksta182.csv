"event","since a lot of ppl have posted bout how much they have changed over the years so i will to cuz God knows ive changed well 1st off the whole thing w/lauren changed me a lot cuz i found out how mean girls can be it wasnt how she broke up w/me it was the fact she lied to everyone else about why we did and how i treated her like shit just about everytime i like a girl a whole lot and we break up i get a little more mature each time i kinda see how ppl are and just accept them for who they are and just try to move on 
i became more friendly to girls since i started fpd ive gotten from just lauren dorsey as a friend to a lot i dont really think i changed but more just grew up really fast the past 4 yrs and i can tell how much mature i am then most guys in my classes like tommy and garrett and them i sure do have a lot of mistakes that i regret a lot and prob the biggest one i wish i never knew her and i regret ever trusting her i dont really also ive gotten to like a lot of different music i just to like rock but now i like some country and rap i mostly listen to punk more emo but yea know what else to say except i like the friends i have made over the years"

other than that nothing has really happen found out lauren has been telling caleb how bad i treated her when we went out it kinda hurts cuz i loved her a lot and i regret ever letting her go like that i duno i guess it was for the best i was pissed at her but now i dont care so w/e

being 18 is alright i guess i havent really been able to do anything really i went to the strip club in warner robins but i had a fake id then i want to go downtown to some clubs and just hang out and meet some ppl i duno its better than hangin out on the zbl or drinkin every weekend which i seem to be doin more of since i just dont care what ppl think of me anymore i duno for awhile i stopped listenin to punk music like the shit no ones heard of and i found myself listenin to it again i duno i just feel like music is the only think that is interesting to me right now i dont care about anything else 

im still going out w/jill its been almost 4 months and honestly i didnt think i would go out w/her for this long tonight she did the sweetest thing that made me feel like the luckest guy cuz she cares about me she much anywayz she called me from her grandmas house down in albany and we talked for like 10 mins but i was at jareds so i just told her to try to call me later if she could and 10 mins later jills friend jessica salter called me and told me that jill wanted to tell me she loved me so much and she missed me but she couldnt call me to tell me cuz her grandma made her go to bed i thought it was the sweetest thing a girl as ever done to me i dont think ive ever had a girl do anything remotely like that just to make me feel like she cares about me so much

this day and age-second place victory-""Second Place Victory"" 
it's breathtaking to think of you and to learn that sometimes the only way out is through. it's mindnumbing to think of yesterday, i'd run to you now if i could but things have changed. (i heard you say) it's enlightening to think of the breeze, to believe in things that we cant see. (so here we go) let's show them how to live, accept the pain always forgive, watch the sun go down and learn the sound of following all that's complete. it's breathtaking to think of you and to learn without faith the sky isn't as blue. it's mindnumbing to think of yesterday, we'll look towards the stars and dream that we're airplanes. (i heard you say) it's enlightening to think of the breeze, when you watch the sunset think of me."

i love this song it reminds me of wanting someone to come back to me and i wouldnt care what we did as long as she was back here w/me

COPELAND LYRICS
""California""

I miss the way you sing low
So I can't hear your voice over
The radio in my car
But you knew every word they sang
You know just the right thing to say when the
Distance rips us farther and farther and farther away
I'll see you soon

If you're coming back this way again
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention

Maybe I fell too fast
Maybe I pushed you away
Now you're gone and I'm afriad
That you're never coming back this away again

I'll see you soon
If you'll come back here
I'll see you soon
Just say that you want to see me too

Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
Are starved for your attention

You know I won't mind if you
Monopolize all my time
I won't say a thing at all
I won't say a word no

So come back from California
Come back from California"

MATCHBOOK ROMANCE LYRICS

""Tiger Lily""

we drive tonight,
and you are by my side.
We're talking about our lives,
like we've known each other forever.
the time flies by,
with the sound of your voice.
its close to paradise,
with the end surely near.
if i could only stop the car
and hold onto you,
and never let go...
i'll never let go.
as we round the corner
to your house
you turned to me and said,
""i'll be going through withdrawl of you for this one night we have spent.""
and, i want to speak these words
but i guess i'll just bite my tongue,
and accept ""someday, somehow""
as the words that we'll hang from.

and i (i..), i don't want to speak these words.
cause i (cause i..), i don't want to make things anyworse.
[x2]

why does tonight, have to end?
why don't we hit restart,
and pause it at our favorite parts.
we'll skip the goodbyes.
if i had it my way,
i'd turn the car around and runaway,
just you and i.

and i (i..), i don't want to speak these words.
cause i (cause i..), i don't want to make things anyworse.
[x2]"

I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 
You could cut ties with all the lies, that you've been living in, 
And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand. 
I would understand, 
The angry boy, a bit too insane, 
Icing over a secret pain, 
You know you don't belong, 
You're the first to fight, You're way too loud, 
You're The flash of light, On a burial shroud, 
I know something's wrong, 
Well everyone I know has got a reason, To say, put the past away, 

I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 
You could cut ties with all the lies, That you've been living in, 
And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, 
I would understand. 

Well he's on the table, And he's gone to code, 
And I do not think anyone knows, 
What they are doing here, 
And your friends have left, You've been dismissed, 
I never thought it would come to this, And I, I want you to know, 
Everyone's got to face down the demons, 
Maybe today, We can put the past away, 

I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 
You could cut ties with all the lies, that you've been living in, 
And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, 
I would understand, 
I would understand... 

Can you put the past away, I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 

I would understand...

AND

LIZ PHAIR-WHY CANT I? i know its a gay song but it is getting me thru this break or w/e and i know w/e happens there will be someone else out there for me and the part best part of breaking up is finding someone else u cant get enough of makes me feel better that i know that if me and lauren dont work out there will be a girl that i cant get enough of...i kno im weird sorry

Get a load of me, get a load of you
Walkin' down the street, and I hardly know you
It's just like we were meant to be

Holding hands with you when we're out at night
Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right
And I've got someone waiting too

What if this is just the beginning
We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

Isn't this the best part of breakin' up
Finding someone else you can't get enough of
Someone who wants to be with you too

It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch
Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch
But wouldn't it be beautiful

Here we go, we're at the beginning
We haven't fucked yet, but my heads spinning

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

High enough for you to make me wonder
Where it's goin'
High enough for you to pull me under
Somethin's growin'
out of this that we can control
Baby I am dyin'

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you"

dashboard confessional-age six racer kinda tells how i feel right now 

So long sweet summer,
I stumbled upon you and gracefully basked in your rays.
So long sweet slumber.
I fell into you now you're gracefully falling away.

Hey thanks, thanks for that summer.
It is cold where your going
I hope that your heart is always warm.
I gave you the best that I had.
You pased on my letters
& passed on the best that I had"

"event","well im in a really good mood right now i duno y but yea its 230am when i started writing this and i just got like this boost of energy its crazy anywayz i found this site and it has all this random sites added daily most of them are funny and i found one w/mitch hedberg quotes so im gonna put one maybe some more i duno prob not but i read this one and it just made me feel so much better i duno guess just kinda showed me that you can find funny things and life and stuff 

I wrote a letter to my dad - I wrote, ""I really enjoy being here,"" but I accidentally wrote rarely instead of really. But I still wanted to use it so i crossed it out and wrote, ""I rarely drive steamboats, dad - there's a lot of shit you don't know about me. Quit trying to act like I'm a steamboat operator."" This letter took a harsh turn right away...

I got in an argument with a girlfriend inside of a tent. That's a bad place for an argument, because then I tried to walk out, and had to slam the flap. How are you supposed to express your anger in this situation? Zip it up real quick?

My roommate says, ""I need to shave and use the shower. Does anyone need to use the bathroom?"" It's like some weird-ass quiz where he reveals the answer first...

...Every time I go and shave I assume there is somebody else on the planet shaving as well, so I say ""I'm gonna go shave too""

Sometimes I wave to people I don't know. It is very dangerous to wave to people you don't know, because what if they don't have a hand? They'll think you're cocky. ""Look what I got motherfucker, this thing is useful...I'm gonna go pick something up""


haha that was so funny at least to me it was im gonna put it on my aim profile cuz im cool like that see im so hyper right now 
im glad jared got back today it was nice to be w/a really close friend specially when i needed someone like that

well im gonna go watch the movie i got from blockbusters its a war movie and its over 2 hrs i think i might be up awhile and thanx to everyone that reads this and posts and the ones that just read it it means a lot to me that yall care what i have to say thanx and keep prayin for me and lauren 

song im listenin to rite now kinda makes me think of lauren ok id admit A LOT of things make me think of lauren but its ok 

yellowcard-only one-Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up (so broken up)
And I give up (I give up) 
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, but there's just no one that gets me like you
You are my only, my only one

Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone

And something's breaking up (breaking up)
I feel like giving up (like giving up)
I won't walk out until you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, but there's just no one that gets me like you
You are my only my only one

Here I go so dishonestly
Leave a note for you my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, but there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one
My only one
My only one
My only one
You are my only, my only one"

2 songs describe the way i feel right now-
  ok the first one is about LAUREN and how i feel bout her right now
SEETHER-BROKEN featuring Amy Lee
   
    I wanted to know, I love the way you laugh
I want to hold you high, and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph, and I know it serves me well
I want to hold you high, and steal your pain.

'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away.

You gotta win, you don't feel me anymore.

The worst is over now, and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, and steal my pain away
There is so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high, and steal your pain.

'Coz Im broken, when I'm open
And I feel like that I'm strong enough
'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away.

'Coz I'm broken, when I'm open
And I don't feel like that I'm strong enough
'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away.

'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away.

'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone.

You gotta win, you don't feel me anymore.

this one is bout me and how im tryin to deal w/everything that is goin on in my life its more of the meaning and the chorus that feels like it explains what im thinkin and what im tryin to do 
   BLINK 182-DAMMIT (this is growing up)
It's alright 
to tell me 
what you think 
about me
I won't try 
to argue 
or hold it 
against you
I know that 
you're leaving 
you must have 
your reasons
The season 
is calling 
and your pictures 
are falling down

The steps that 
I retrace 
the sad look 
on your face
The timing 
and structure 
did you hear 
he fucked her?
A day late 
a buck short 
I'm writing 
the report
On losing 
and failing 
when I move 
I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up

Well I guess this is growing up

And maybe 
I'll see you 
at a movie 
sneak preview
You'll show up 
and walk by 
on the arm 
of that guy
And I'll smile 
and you'll wave 
we'll pretend 
it's okay
The charade 
it won't last 
when he's gone 
I won't come back

And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up [4x]
Well, I guess this is growing up

LAUREN just wanted u to know thanx for all the good memories we had together i had fun and dont worry i dont care that u hurt me i honestly dont hope you feel better and w/e it is that is makin u that way all works out 
 gotta leave w/a quote from anchorman -""I'm gonna shoot you in the head w/a bb gun when your not lookin"" well goodnight to me and pray for us please"

"event","i decided to write one about lauren well mostly about her ill at least try to stay on her but it prob wont but anywayz i was reading johns journal im that guy that reads everybodys anywayz i was thinkin how me and him are in such deep relationships im really glad that he found someone that makes him feel so happy im also glad i found someone that makes me feel so happy i duno its just amazing. i love lauren so much i just i duno its like the feelings for her just want to make me yell out at the top of my lungs how much i love her i love how well we get along w/eachother and i love the way she holds my hand, looks at me, writes me notes, calls me, holds me, i love everything about her and i feel so lucky to have met someone so amazing i mean its just unbelieveable how much i care for her and how much i want to be w/her i wish she could sleep w/me at night so when i wake up in the moring i can see her next to me its so hard to express the ways that make me feel so loved from her and how much love i have for her I LOVE YOU LAUREN 

 
ok next thing the cat story of johns reminds me back when me and my parents first moved to georgia and we lived in forsyth and we found star (our black lab) in the woods someone had just droped off a 6 week old puppy prob cuz we lived next door to the vet that we still go to just cuz he is nice and gives good prices on the tick stuff and yea anywayz like 6 months later we were bout to move to macon and i remember my mom found a dog that was just like star but a boy same age everything so we had him for a month and we were trying to give it away cuz star was already a lot for us and i remember one day after a school at MA we got out at 245 too that school is retarded anywayz my mom picked me up and she was crying i was like whats wrong and she said i killed puppy we didnt name him yet so thats what we called him she said that she ran over him on accident we had this kinda long drive way and he was chasing the car and she ran over his neck my mom showed him to me when i got home and i remember my mom put him in the masterbed room cuz we didnt have a garage door and we had 7 acres of land so there were coyotes and everything and i remember star was at the masterbedroom door cryin and tryin to get it i started crying cuz i knew star thought something was wrong w/puppy well i buried him in the yard and that was that kinda depressing but yea i duno the hardest part was to see how star became like a mother to that puppy he would follow her where ever she went and back then we let them roam around since we had some land i duno i just remember how star acted so big when puppy was around they always seemed to go off to the lake at the vets house cuz they would always come back wet i duno i just keep remembering how the puppy would always follow star that day my mom ran over puppy she said that it took her 20mins to get star and puppy back to the road and then she was gonna put them in the car cuz star likes to chase cars but it took her a long time to get star so she just left puppy on the dirt road thinkin he would follow the car that was a sad day but i didnt really ever think about it till that story of johns oh well glad i thought of it


kinda funny if u think about it u forget a lot of ur memories everyday and sometimes u never remember them again and then something reminds u of a memory like today i was thinkin bout forth of july and all the times i used to go w/my neighborhood friends back in plano me chase, morgan and his sister, and todd and our families would always go to somewhere in dallas and watch them i remember this one time there was this red plane i duno what it was doin i think it was advertising something but i was memerized w/it i duno and we would always buy those glow in the dark necklaces and stuff i miss those days we would play tag using my friends yard and if u climb this short wooden fence u couldnt be taged random i know and how we used to play soccer and football at drew and kyles house they lived across the street from me but they were a lot younger than us and we would fish down by the creek behind todds house but it was really a sewage thingy i duno what it was actaully but i think it was close to that but it was like water run off from the street but they had a dam kinda and then it turned into a creek w/no concrete or anything so we would fish all the time it was fun and i had a lot of good memorys that was pretty much my childhood except i played basket ball and baseball and not just soccer and well there was this ""dance"" they had down at the rec center by my house and it was called sat. night plano its kinda like south beach but it was for like 8-14 yr old ppl it was pretty fun they had a basket ball place and a snack bar and they had dancing i met a lot of 1-3 week g/fs there yea i was young back then u would be amazed at how many ppl went to this every sat night it was prob around 600-800 ppl i used to go to a soccer game on sat afternoon or moring then go home take a shower and me and my friend ben from the soccer team would go to the dance or a movie 



im writing this cuz its makin me feel better about my life remembering all the good times i had back there whats weird is like morgan and his sister moved a yr before we did and then we moved and then chase moved and then todd moved so like every friend i had from my neighborhood moved sooner or later i would like to seem them one day though and i know where chase and morgan live ive visited morgan like 3 yrs ago when we went back to texas i remember his sister had grown some and she looked hot but i didnt try anything im not that type of guy u know she is 16 now i think but morgan and chases family send us a christmas card every yr but whats really weird is they guys i hung out at school moved too well i know my friend dane moved me and him used to ride are bikes to school when back in the day it was 2 miles so i was always in shape and thats prob how i am kinda fast we started to go to the dance together but not in that way i mean we went to find girls thats what u do there i duno he was prob my best friend i visisted him that same yr a saw morgan but i havent talked to him since then and i think mark a guy ive known since kindergarden was gonna go to a private school which is like a atl one cuz it was expensive as shit to get in and the public school system was really good so like i duno not that many ppl went to one of those and rob moved to somewhere i didnt become friends w/him till like a few months before i moved and matt moved but i duno where i knew him since kindergarden too god now im remember my last day at my old house and the party my friends threw it was a good night and i had fun i remember we stayed a few days more so i could play in a soccer tournament w/my soccer team then i moved well im gonna go this is way to long no one is prob gonna read this but oh well later love you lauren"

"event","So, again it's been an extraordinairily long time since my last updated.  Hmm..the quick version...had a falling out with fb player 2 (ginger), went to Miami, ran into fb player 1 (crazy), job got outsourced, made up with ginger, went to San Antonio and Boston, and currently wanting to drink my life away.  Oooh, drama.  haha.  But it's really not that bad.

The ginger just doesn't know what he wants.  I think that he's caught between ""big man (seriously, he's 300 lbs) on campus"" syndrome and actually wanting to be a nice guy.  We didn't end the spring on very good terms and he had an internship this summer.  Now he's back in town and things are looking a little more positive.  He starts camp tomorrow, so I'll see what happens in a couple weeks.  I think that I'm just going to lay it out for him, let it be, and see what he does.  It's going to be the easiest and best solution for now.  Whatever.

Miami was crazy.  I never thought that I'd be a beach person until I went there...but I could only ever go back for a short vacation.  It's a little too crazy there for me.  We ended up meeting and hanging out with Ami from Miami Ink.  He's a nice guy, although he's way too full of himself.

Crazy footballer popped up again at the beginning of the summer, seemingly all excited to see me.  I'm only going to contact him for amusement purposes.  The funniest stuff comes out of his mouth all the time.  

The store got outsourced, but I still have the same job, but at a little higher (not really enough to make a difference) wage.  The new manager is a little crazy though.  I know that his ideas worked at other schools, but I just feel like he's trying to make too many changes before he really knows how rush works here.  We'll see what happens.

Anyway...the boy drama and the insane work scenario are making me want to drink.  A lot.  All the time.  Thankfully, I have friends who are more than willing to drink themselves silly with me."

"event","Hmm...so I'm not so good with the updating.  hahah.  Really?  Lots of crazy things have happened since the last update.

The football player is still crazy...although out of the picture totally now.  Although, being crazy, he has pulled some strange moves in the past month or so, so I'm kind-of expecting him to pop up out of nowhere when I least expect it, but I'm prepared to deal with that.

The Boston visit was amazing!  I think that I could definitely see living there for a while.  Puma has a lot of corporate jobs there.  Hmm....

A new football player (I know, right) came on to the scene between the last update and now.  I'm still trying to figure out this one.  He's the king of mixed signals.  He initiates a lot of flirting, but then has little follow-through.  I'm trying not to worry about it so much...just trying to see where things go.  It's hard though because I've heard that he's a really nice guy and he's cute, blah blah blah, so I don't really want to give up, but I don't want to go overboard.  I may post details like I did for the first fb player to see if I can get some opinions on the situation, but I'm going to think about that one.

Oh, my birthday was last month.  Got completely out of control.  I don't think that I've had that much to drink in a very very long time.  I haven't really drank very much since then either.  I'm surprised that I'm not dead.  But...it was one of the best birthdays I've had in a really long time.  I received a lot of birthday messages, flowers, a cake, drinks...lots of people going out with me.  It was awesome.

Dara and I are going to Miami next month for spring break.  So excited!  It will be a blast."

He can get back to me when he gets himself in order.  This deletion is in no way reflective of my future actions.  We all know that I'll be more than willing to talk/hang out with him if he stops acting like such a tool bag.  Just sayin.  Last night I found out that my friend Nicole spilled a drink on him the last time she saw him at a bar.  haahha.

In other news, I went home for a day and a half.  Fixed a big dinner for the family and had my laundry done for free.  

Tabby and Wendy called me while out on an adventure in DC.  It was definitely awesome to hear from them, especially Tabby.  She was in Yemen for the summer and only had 2 days in Indiana before moving, so I haven't talked to her in a long time.  I'm going to have to visit DC sometime soon.  

Speaking of going places, I'm going to Boston next month to visit Dara.  It will be a blast.

Dawn will hopefully be visiting Indiana sometime in the near future...woo!

Ashley is going to come to a football game sometime in October and will be crashing here.  Very excited because I haven't seen her in a really long time.

That's about all that's going on here...weird boys and friends in far away places.  Plus...there are a lot of good shows coming up.."

"event","So, Dawn sent me a reminder that I hadn't updated my journal in 17 weeks.  Oh my.  So much has happened since then.  It's definitely long and involved.  I'm not sure if I'm up to typing it all out now.  Some parts of the story make me angry, others happy, but mainly I'm just confused.  Hmm...I think that I will tell the story so maybe I can get some insight from the people here in lj land...especially those of you that I don't really talk to all that often.  Here goes...
<lj-cut text=""give me some advice on this long story"">
I meet a guy through a mutual friend at the end of April.  We all met up at a bar, fun times.  I tell him that I'm adding him to Facebook when we take him home at the end of the night.  

He goes home to Australia a week later.  We send some messages through Facebook while he's gone.  Nothing too exciting though.  

He comes back at the end of June.  Comes into the store where I work to pick up his books...I don't know if he'll remember me, so I don't say anything to him.  After work, I have a Facebook message from him...basically ""didn't know it was you, sorry I didn't say hi, what's up.""  Send a message back.  Up pops an instant message from him.  We make plans to see a movie two days later.  

Talk online the next day.  He has to come pick up a book, so he asks me when I work.

Day of the date...comes in to get his book, awkward conversation.  After work, phone rings...he cancels the date because he has homework.  But he had kept my number from almost 2 months prior without using it before and he waited until he knew I'd be home.

Next day, hanging out with mutual friend.  We meet up with him and his friends at a bar.  Go back to his house.  Go out where he proceeds to make out with some random girl.  Not cool.

Random online conversations over the next week.

I let him know that I'll be on vacation from July 4 through that Sunday.  He randomly comes into my store between his classes just to chat.  Tells me to talk to him later.  Later, we make plans to meet after he sees a movie with his friend.  Go to his house with mutual friend where he ignores all of us.  Strange.

Next weekend, my friends and I meet up with him at a bar.  Flirty conversation the whole night, invitation to my house for racing two days later.  Call him when I get home and he says ""I would have gone home with you if you had asked.""  He calls me 15 minutes later, telling me that he's walking home...I tell him that I can pick him up, but he refuses.

Next night, talk online, go to his house later in the night.  We go out with his friends.  Flirting.  I end up spending the night at his place.  Seemingly no morning after awkwardness.  Usual online conversations later in the day.

Over the next couple weeks, the conversations are either normal or really short on his end.  Lots of ""what are you doing tonight?"" ""well, I'm doing this"" and ""I'm doing this.""  We don't actually meet up though.

Friday, mutual friend and I go to his house for about 10 minutes.  Odd.  I start drunk texting him later.  We make plans to meet up later at his place, but I leave him hanging and don't respond again until he's already asleep.  

Saturday, online conversation.  Normal for us...meaning slightly strange.  I finally get frustrated and ask if he's interested in hanging out with me at all.  He makes a point of saying just as friends about 3 or 4 times.  I was just sick of trying to make plans to no avail.  I make a joke about not texting him late at night anymore and he has a nonresponse.

Now he's in camp for 3 weeks, so I won't see or talk to him at all during that time.  I know that things will probably be normal for us when he gets back...random online conversations.  I'm not totally convinced that he isn't interested, but it's really so hard to tell with him.  I also know that we'll run into each other at the bars and if he isn't with some other girl, I'm sure that there will be some flirting.  I know that I should just forget about him, but I can't. </lj-cut>"

"event","Wow...I can't believe that it's been 3.5 months since my last update.  I haven't really been that busy, mainly just lazy.  I've thought about updating, but as soon as I open the box to start an entry, my mind goes blank.  It's not like there's anything of pressing importance to communicate.  *shrug*

The job kicked my ass in January.  It was so busy (of course) and a lot of my staff just decided to stop coming to work.  We survived though, and I learned a lot about what to do next time.  Other than that, the job is fine.  Some days are really boring and others are really stressful, but I'm sure that every job is like that.  

I had some pictures developed this week of the Blackalicious show that Melissa and I went to a couple weeks ago and of Jillian's visit last week.  Thankfully, most of the pictures were good.  But....there are some where my head just looks like a blob.  Seriously, it's like i have no jaw and my face just melds into my neck.  Attractive, no?  The good ones are posted on Facebook or <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/lindsay_7"">Myspace</a>.  Speaking of pictures, I just now purchased a digital camera, so many more new pictures will be coming soon. 

I have to go out as much as possible between now and the first of May.  There are a ton of awesome people who are graduating and leaving immediately after, so I have to get the quality, wild times in with them now.  Dara and I are doing something random tomorrow.  We really haven't decided yet, but I know that it will be fun.  Erin is going to come down sometime this month, but it's looking like that won't be until the end of the month because next weekend is Easter and the following weekend is Little 5 and we're just not going to deal with the crowd that will be out for that one.  Plus, I need to go to Chicago to visit Ashley.  I haven't seen her in such a long time.  :(  The panic attacks that I had last year kept me from visiting Bloomington.  Bleh."

I'm also excited that I have to work only 4 hours on Christmas Eve at Gordon's (12 to 4 for any of you last minute shoppers who'd love to see me).  I can't wait to see what I get!  Although, I pretty much know what I'm getting...at least I hope that I get everything (well, at least the shoes, ring, and sweaters) that I asked for.  haha.  Oh goodness.  I hope that the gifts that I got for the fam go over well.

The new job......yeah.  I'm way stressed.  I know that in the future, it won't be so bad, but now....man.  It's all madness.  I'll be happy when it's February.  In the meantime, I'll accept any and all spa gift certificates and anything else you want to give me.

I just got back from Greenville, SC.  Why you ask?  Well, my best friend in the whole wide world just got married!!!!!!!!!  It was amazing.  She and Jaime picked me up from the airport late Monday night and we got to spend a little time together.  Tuesday..girls' day out!  We had mani-pedi's (hhahahha), ate some delicious food, watched a movie, fell asleep, gushed over her dress, went out with everyone's families for more food.  We had a solid 12 hours of quality time to make up for what we've lacked since she moved to Hawaii.  The wedding was beautiful.  It fit their personalities so well.  I cried, of course.  It was just awesome to be able to spend so much time together.  We talked on the phone last week or so and we're still so much alike.  It's so refreshing to be able to completely connect to someone who you haven't seen in such a long time.  I'm so lucky that she's my friend.  She's moving back to the mainland, so I'll be able to see her more often.  This twice in 4 years thing isn't going to cut it."

I'm still going to work at Gordon's part-time through Christmas, because 3 of us are leaving at the same time, so Mike will be hurting for experienced help.  I hope that having both jobs for a while won't totally wipe me out.

I think that I may have found an apartment.  It's pretty cheap and it's sorta nice.  You can definitely tell that it was built 20-30 years ago though, because of the carpeting and tile color schemes.  I'm not completely sure that I really like it.  Also, November is an odd time to start a lease in Bloomington, so I'm not sure how that will work out in the future when I want to move.  I'm going to talk my dad into going up with me on Saturday to check it out so I can get his opinion."

"event","Jen and Dan's wedding was wonderful.  They both looked really great.  The decorations were awesome.  I stumbled over my words a couple times during my readings, but my part did go smoothly as a whole.  Carrie, one of the old student managers, was there with her boyfriend and we had a really good time at the reception.

The Sage Francis show was pretty good.  Could have been better.  I definitely did not like the opener that I saw...I think that it was Sole?  Anyway, not good, at least in my opinion.  Sage was awesome though, as usual.  I was planning on sticking around after the show so I could take a picture with him, but I had an awful, pounding headache, so I decided to jet instead.  Vicky didn't come to the show and I'm not sure what's up with that.  I'll have to get a hold of her somehow to see what happened, because I do know that she was very excited about it.

Geek and some IU kids are having this huge rave (ahahhahah, that word just makes me laugh) Halloween weekend.  I'm really thinking about going, although I don't want to go by myself, even though there will be a lot of people who I know there.  Micah is coming in from DC and spinning, so that will be awesome.  Plus, it's free.  I just need to find a costume, because the store's Halloween party is the same night and I know that everyone there will be dressed up.

I've ordered some clothes from Gap and a bracelet from Ed Levin (thanks for that info Ashley!), that I'm anxiously awaiting.  I just hope that the bracelet isn't too big.  I ordered a dress from Anthropolgie that I sent back because it just didn't fit right.  It was super-cute online, but not so much in person.  It was a v-neck, knee length black lace dress that I wanted to be my all-purpose ""little black dress.""  Something appropriate for a nice dinner or a funeral.  Whatever.  I'll have to go shopping in Louisville or Indy to find something to replace it."

So, I'm no longer going to be unemployed.  I'm staying at the jewelry store for a little while longer.  Until I find a new job, or save enough money to move.  My managers know that this is the plan, and they're cool with it.  Which is very nice.  Although, I think Connie and Alicia will do their best to convince me to stay forever and ever.  We'll see.  For now, I'm mainly going to be working opening shifts Monday through Friday, with an occasional weekend.  Much better.  Especially since I worked 4 or 5 Sundays in a row.  Yay for football and racing Sundays!"

I hope that something comes up really soon, so I won't have too much downtime, although I'd love to catch up on sleep.  I'm kind-of thinking about going to Asheville for a couple days to apply for some jobs and possibly have some interviews (if things turn out well).  Should I call around to places that I'm interested in before going down there?  That seems like a smart thing to do.  I'll just wait and see what happens with the applications I've already submitted.

I was able to have a short lunch with Carms on Saturday.  It was very nice indeed and we're going to make plans to hang out sometime very soon.  After I quit the job, it will be easier to schedule things.

I found an outfit for the wedding.  I really wanted a dress, but the one I found is on backorder until November.  I bought a nice sparkly sweater and a really cute floral/tree print skirt.  And some supercute brown wedges.

I think that in some part, I'm too comfortable with my life as it is.  I don't really have to worry about too many things, so that makes it difficult to move into a situation where I have a lot more worries.

Working right next to Target has kind-of made me sad the past week.  So many kids with their parents buying things for their dorm rooms.  It's very strange to not be a part of the whole back to school ritual.  It wasn't so strange to graduate in December because it just seemed like I was taking a break.  Now, it's really hit home that I am indeed finished with school.  I think that I've gotta get out of Bloomington.  I would definitely like to have a new start somewhere else, even though it's scary as hell.

The Brickyard was awesome!  The new seats are really nice, although they would be better if they were not as far down along the stand...we're in box 22 and something around boxes 1-10 would definitely be better.  Anyway, I got Robby Gordon's autograph on a hat!  He had an autograph session at his merchandise trailer before the race.  Unfortunately, we didn't have the camera with us, because my dad is just smart like that.  He's much better looking in person than he is on tv....still very cute....and rich.  Ahhh.  During the race, my dad turned to me and said, 100% seriously, ""you know, you should have slipped him your name and number.  that's how girls meet those guys.""  Like I didn't think of that before.  It is good to know that Dad is looking out for my best interests though.  Hahahahhah.

I'm still hoping to get that other job.  I've been stalking Biltmore relentlessly for the past month.  It's getting really out of hand though.  The guy I've been talking to just doesn't care to return phone calls in a timely manner and is hardly ever in his office.  I'm gonna call the dude every 15 minutes tomorrow until I actually speak to him.  I'm just so tired ot the damn jewelry store.  The manager is just driving me crazy.  He has this tone that he uses all the time that just makes you feel so stupid, although he's trying to be helpful.  It's very annoying and I'm tired of working with him and talking to him and our regional manager on the phone.  Gah.  It will feel so good to give my two weeks' notice.  

I need to find something that will make my dog stop barking at night.  My bedroom is on the back end of the house and he barks constantly at all the little (and sometimes big...can't forget the bobcat that tree'ed one of the cats) critters that roam around in the country.  Yelling at him does no good.  Sometimes, he'll give me a look, but most often he'll just ignore me and keep on barking.  Loud ass dog."

I need some new clothes too.  But I really just need to save my money at the moment.  So I'm gonna pass on the nails, because even if I get a silk wrap, I'm going to break or chip or otherwise damage something, so in the end, it will be a waste of money.  The hair....I'm thinking about doing the color myself, but I don't want to do that in case I do decide to go to the salon in the next couple months.  The clothes...there's nothing out that I really like and if I do happen to get a new job, I'll probably need a different wardrobe than what I need now, so in the end, yet another waste of money.  

The Brickyard is next weekend!  Excitement!  The new seats should be wonderful, provided that they're not in the sun all day...but with my luck..."

The job still sucks.  If any of you are in Bloomington, stop by the mall and pay me a visit.  I haven't heard anything from Barnes & Noble, so I think that I'll give them a call before I go to work on Tuesday.  Yesterday, I applied for a job at Biltmore in Asheville...maybe that will work out.  It would be very nice indeed.

<lj-cut text=""OMG Harry Potter"">  So, I went to Walmart to pick up the book a little after midnight.  The place was deserted, because I think that not too many people from the OC read.  I read for a couple hours before I got way dizzy from sleepiness.  I finished the book Saturday afternoon.  I'm still in shock.  Little children will be crying like mad when they finish this one.  I've already started reading it again, because I went through it so quickly the first time.  I can't wait for the seventh book, but at the same time, I don't want it to come because it will be the end.  I'm very surprised at how things turned out.  Very intense.  I'm dying to talk to someone else who's read it.  Just wow.  </lj-cut>"

"event","I got the job at the jewelry store.  However, I think that I may hate it.  All of the people who work there are so nice and fun and friendly and helpful...so it's the actual job that sucks.  Selling is hard!  Ugh. *whine*  We role play to hone our selling techniques.  It's so hard for me to transition from just talking to going to the product to making a sale.  I never know what to say, and I go in for the kill too soon, and I'm awkward with the cases and products.  It makes me uncomfortable.  I know that I just need practice, but I'm not sure that I'll like it anymore once I get the hang of it (if that even happens).

So, because this job sucks based on my three days of working, I filled out an application for Barnes & Noble.  hahahah.  Definitely a better fit for me.  I like looking at the pretty jewels all day, but that's not enough.  The BN customer is going to be generally low maintenance.  But of course, I always get stuck with the crazies, so I'm prepared for that.  I applied on Wednesday, so hopefully *fingers crossed* they'll call me tomorrow.  I feel kinda bad wanting to bail out so quickly, but this way I'm not wasting anyone's time...the store's, the manager's, or mine...by leaving early.  They can definitely hire someone else to replace me.  LJ readers, keep your fingers crossed for the BN job to save my soul!

So, the panic attacks are under control.  I went to the doctor and got some Xanax to use situationally.  It's nice to have something to take that will take care of the attack right away that I don't have to worry about taking every day.  I've just used it when I have to go to work, because I'm not comfortable with that yet.  I'm doing a lot better around home.  I can go to the store alone or run some errands and be perfectly fine, so that's great.  Mainly though, I'm waiting for the day I can get insurance and go to a therapist or something to get the root of the problem taken care of.  But all is definitely well now.  :)

The weekend was nice.  We had two cookouts...burgers and hot dogs one night, barbeque chicken the next....plus smores!  No fireworks though, since I'm terrified.  Poor Thadius dog is scared of them too, so he spent the night in the garage because various neighbors were setting some off and he could hear the booms."

So the farmer's market was not good.  I didn't break even.  The baking wasn't bad as a task, but the selling wasn't fun.  It seemed that most people were more interested in produce and plants instead of baked goods.  And there were at least 2 or 3 other vendors selling similiar items.  I think that I'll just stick to buying stuff instead of being a vendor.  I didn't go this weekend because I was supposed to go to Indy for Formula 1 qualifying.....

<lj-cut text=""rambling about panic attacks"">Indy, that was a disaster.  My stomach was feeling iffy before we left, but I just chalked that up to a little panic.  So I took the remedy that has worked in the past and thought ""I'll be fine once we get there.""  WRONG.  I was a little panicky on the way, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary...I've felt that way in the past couple weeks and it's always gone away once I get settled...but Mom and Dad told me that if I wanted to go home to just let them know.  Anyway, once we hit 465, I completely lost it.  I was crying, which has never happened before and a mess.  We went ahead to Crawfordsville Road and thought that if we just sat around for a while, I'd calm down.  Nope.  So we make it close enough to the track to hear some cars practicing, then turn around to go the hour and a half home.  Such a waste of a day.  Mom and Dad were definitely disappointed but they completely understood that I just couldn't do it.  I thankfully fell asleep on the way home.  I'm most definitely making a doctor's appointment this week to get some serious meds for this.  My granny checked on the price of xanax for me, since I don't have insurance, and the generic kind is completely affordable.  I just want something I can take when I know I'll be in a panic-inducing situation to alleviate the attack.  Then once I get a job with benefits, I'll look for a better solution to get rid of these suckers for good.  It would be nice if the anxiety just went away as randomly as it came.  Gah.  This really blows, but I'll get it worked out.  I think the crying had to do with pms (sorry, boys), which sucks in itself. </lj-cut>

This past week, my Granny's family came in for a family reunion.  These people are crazy.  So funny and so not caring about what others think.  Great-aunts and -uncles from Texas and Oregon were here.  Marty and Bill from Texas are hilarious and just a blast to be around.  Jim and Brenda from Oregon are a little more laid back, but by the end of the week they were so tired of being here that they just didn't care what they said to anyone.  It's really too bad that they live so far away.  They're all in their 70s and it had been about 5 years since Bill and Marty had visited, and 13 for Jim and Brenda.  Granny and my other aunt Mabel visit them, but we never make it to visit as a group.  We had a nice cookout at our house on Thursday night and it was fun to be able to hang out with everyone...definitely more fun than you would think hanging out with people 25-55 years your senior could be.

I had two interviews this week with Gordon's Jewelers. (I hope I don't jinx myself by writing about this!)  The original interview was with the store manager in Bloomington for a sales position there, but because I'm interested in management, he had me interview later in the week with the regional manager for that program.  As far as I know though, the job would still be in the Bloomington store.  Which is very nice considering that I have no money to move anywhere and I'm not sure if they offer relocation.  I can drive from the O.C. to Bton until I have enough saved to move.  The first interview was on Tuesday and the second on Friday, so I should hear something on Monday.  So..tying in the previous paragraph to this one....the 4 of them and Mabel and her husband just happen to be at the mall during my interview.  The manager had to keep going back to the store to help with sales, and during one of the breaks, Marty walks up to my table.  I flipped and turned to see the other 5 shopping in the jewelry store.  They of course, then threatened Mike...telling him that they wouldn't buy anything unless I got the job, that they would buy the store and fire him and let me do whatever, lynching was apparently even mentioned.  Again, I say, crazy family.  Luckily, he thought they were really funny and that it was cool that we happened to be at the mall at the same time.  When they left on Thursday, they made me promise to keep them informed on the job and said that if I don't get it, they'll come back to take care of business.  ha."

"event","So..I didn't go to the Indy 500.  I got scared that I'd have a panic attack.  Oh goodness.  My whole day just felt off.  I really should have gone.  I think that I would have been fine.  It was so weird not to be there.  I mean, I've gone to every race (save 2 or 3) since I was 7!  That's 16 years!  And it was such a pretty day at the track.  My dad and uncle came home saying that it was the best race they've seen in 10 years.  *sigh*  Mom and I cheered on Danica from home.  Definitely not the same as being there.

In two weeks, we'll be heading to Indy for the U.S. Grand Prix.  Well, not the race, but practice and qualifications.  If you can make it to the track for that, definitely do it.  Those cars are amazing.  Very fast start time and the sound is crazy.

We got our tickets for the Brickyard 400 today.  We sit in the paddock (the front stretch) and we've been trying to get a seat change to turn 1, which is where the 500 tickets are, for a couple years now.  Well...we now have 4 tickets in turn 1....the other 16 are still in the same place.  I absolutely hate the paddock and have therefore claimed one of the E Stand tickets.  Now, we just have to figure out who's sitting with me.  <sarcasm> That's not going to be messy or anything. </sarcasm>

I have an interview with H&M next Tuesday in Indianapolis.  It's the one in the previous entry...I rescheduled.  Still not too excited about it.  Oh well.

Ohh...I'm going to start selling baked goods at the local farmers' market.  Hahhahahah.  I do love to bake, though.  Hopefully I'll make some money.  I'm not really sure how much to fix though.  As of now, I'm fixing: 
- banana bread (4 loaves)
- sourdough bread (2 or 4 loaves, haven't decided)
- lemon bars (3 dozen)
- apple coffee cake (2)
- chocolate chip cookies (3 dozen)
- buried cherry cookies (4 dozen)
- oatmeal raisin cookies (4 dozen) 
- pineapple upside-down cake (2)
  As far as preparation, it won't be a big deal.  I just don't know if it's too much or not enough to sell.  I don't really want to sell out of everything really early, but I don't want to be stuck with a lot of stuff at the end of the day.  And I'm not really sure about pricing.  Two weeks ago, I noticed that a woman was selling pies for $5, so that gives me some idea.  How much would you pay for a dozen cookies?  Or a loaf of bread?  Keep in mind that everything is totally homemade."

"event","So, life has been kinda dull, thus no updates.

Swayers came to visit again two weekends ago.  Everytime she comes to visit, we spring crazy Orange County gossip on her that almost scars her for life.  Too many people we know getting married, people coming out who previously had no inkling of being even bisexual, people murdering others then killing themselves. hahahah.  Strange place this is.  She is friends with (well, with his wife) the gasman on one of the Red Bull Cheever cars.  So she gets free Red Bull and V.I.P. passes and such for the track.  Unfortunately, she couldn't get any for me on race day, as they're all already taken.  But it's cool nonetheless.

The bro graduated last Saturday.  The ceremony was really short, which was nice because the gym was way hot.  I noticed that, like my class, all of the smart ones are girls.  We had a nice open house for him after the ceremony and I did a good job of playing hostess.  Only two of his friends stopped by though, which was surprising, especially since some of them didn't have their parties until the next day.

I taught my mom about matching clothing and why she should buy something she'll actually wear more than once, instead of getting another cute outfit that will only sit in her closet and gather dust after one wearing.

I bought some new sheets at Target.  They are so cute, but the metallic threads in them broke and now they're all rough and itchy and poke-y.  We washed them (obviously) and I don't have the receipt, but I'm hoping that I can return them for store credit or something, since they're a Target brand and it's a manufacturing defect.

I have a job interview in Indy next Wednesday.  I'm not really too excited about it though.  I found another job that I'd much rather have in Asheville, NC.  Maybe those people will call me before that other interview!

The 500 is this weekend!  I'm really excited, although I am kinda worried that I might have a panic attack.  I'm just going to try to get as much rest as possible, eat well, and work on some relaxation techniques beforehand.  I can't miss this race!  I'm hoping that my excitement will work in my favor...it did when I went to The Roots show.  I felt kinda panicky, but then just the engery and fun of the show put me at ease.  Plus, this race may be one for the recordbooks.  Danica Patrick looks like she has a legitimate shot at winning and there's no way I'd miss that.  Plus, these drivers do things that people said couldn't be done in open-wheel cars, so the race will be good no matter what.  And the weather is supposed to be nice and mild...a high of like 73 or something.  So much better than roasting or freezing to death (both of which I have done...plus, getting rained on)."

The Roots show was amazing.  My hearing hasn't been the same since that show though.  Eep!  I think that the band really enjoyed themselves, especially ?uest, seeing as how he walked around the crowd during his drum solo.  Jillian and I had a lot of fun.  After The Roots, we went to see the Living Legends at the Bird.  Also, tons of fun.

Jillian told me that she and a friend may be moving to Southern California after the summer.  It's something that I may consider if I don't have any job offers before then.  Of course, I'll have to see if this is okay with the two of them.  I think it would definitely be so much easier to move somewhere new with other people instead of doing it solo.

I went shopping yesterday.  I bought cookbooks, another Sex and the City DVD, and the new Mars Volta CD, but just one item of clothing...the main reason I needed to shop.  It's a cute strapless sundress, white with yellow flowers.  But I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it.  It looks nice and is so adorable, but I don't know if I'll really wear it that often.  Hmm..I've got until next Wednesday to decide, per the store's return policy.  hehe.  Speaking of shopping, I found awesome necklaces that I really want, that are fairly cheap.  Well, cheap for handmade sterling silver.  One is $70 and the other is maybe $120.  And I do need both, even though I'd settle for one.  Hmm...if I return the dress, I could buy the cheaper necklace.  Decisions, decisions.  Of course, I wouldn't object to anyone buying them for me.  Hint, hint.  heh.

No news on the boy front.  He invited me to see him perform in an mc battle on Monday, but I would have had to gone by myself...so I didn't go.   Yeah, I know...dumb.  I'm not sure when he's leaving town either.  There aren't any shows coming up that I know of, so I'm just silently hoping that he'll ask me to do something (again).  I'm so lame."

"event","So this weekend has been one of catching up with old friends.  Mostly good, but some really bad.  
First two friends, one an ex,...kind-of sketchy characters...we go out to the bar in town.  Totally sucks (imagine that) and one is pressuring me to drink...so obnoxious.  Told me that I sold out everything I once believed because I want to work for Gap and I listen to hip hop.....sure.  Finally, I've had way too much of his crap, so we start to go home...except that friend two took his car.  We walk to friend two's house, but he's not home.  Then he drives by, so we stop.  Friends get into an argument, and one ends up headbutting two, thus knocking him to the ground with a bloody nose.  Yeah.  That night was a barrel of laughs.  Never going out with them again.

Second night, boy from out of town.  Aesop Rock show in Bton.  Not a bad show, I had a mild panic attack at the end :( so I went out to the car early.  Boy was not really his usual, ass-grabbing self, which kinda surprised me.  It was nice to catch up, and we may be going to some more shows next week, so I hope that I don't panic again...because I've maybe got a little baby crush on him....which definitely would have worked 5 years ago, but we'll see what happens.

Third night...the only friend I care to talk to from high school.  Ahh, my girl Swayers.  She was in town to visit her family and she came to the house for a while to catch up with her second family.  Good times all around.  She's freakin hilarious and I'm a bad friend for not calling her more often."

Just another week until Aesop Rock!  Hopefully some of the Louisville guys will go with me.  I posted it on their message board, so maybe they'll work up enough motivation in the next week to actually go to a show instead just talking about it.  Ben, if I get one of those guys to go with me, you won't have to go unless you just want to..it's an underground hip hop thing and unfortunately, the annoying New Yorkers will be out in force for this show.

"event","So, my last day of the awful spa job is Wednesday.  I have to work tomorrow, but as of last night, we aren't going to be that busy, and I'm the extra coverage person, so I'm thinking that I might just leave early.  I'll definitely play the ""oh, I don't feel well at all *cough* *sulk*"" thing.  Hmm..my throat is a little sore now, so maybe I just won't go in at all.  Ehhh...I'm a little too nice for that, but we'll see.  Then, I'll go shopping. hahhahahahahah (yes, that was the evil laugh that you've heard if you know me)

Shopping...I was going to go today, but the bro had stuff to do and I didn't want to go by myself.  So I slept all day instead.  I need to buy a dress or a very nice skirt outfit thing.  And some shoes.  And some stuff from Gap that I've been meaning to get.  Plus, I need to go to Whole Foods.  Oh that hippie grocery store...I love it.  Even though I really hate hippies.  You take the good with the bad.  *shrug*

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  I bought my (and Jillian's) tickets for the Roots show today.  15th row center...because I overslept a little and wasn't able to buy right when they went onsale.  But they'll still be good seats....and...it's The Roots...it won't be bad from anywhere in that auditorium.  Also found out that Rahzel is going to be in Bton 2 days after the Roots show.  And I need to talk to Tim about going to the Aesop Rock show Friday the 8th...uhhh, if anyone (not just Tim, who probably doesn't read this anyway) reading this wants to go to the Aesop Rock show, let me know ASAP.  It's at the Bird and only $15."

So I have no idea where those dreams are coming from.  It's definitely one of those things where you wake up and go ""wtf?""

I am so tired of this cold weather.  I want to wear some skirts and blind everyone with my pasty pale legs.

I also need to go shopping.  I get paid next Thursday and the bro owes me some money for Mom's birthday present, so hoepfully I'll be able to hit Gap next weekend.  I'd just order everything online, but with my luck, I'd have a problem with it all.

I'm still up in the air about work.  It's not really hard or anything, though during the week it's way boring.  And now that I'm fully trained (after a week, right...), I'll be opening and closing by myself.  I almost fell asleep sitting up this morning.  And I so do not fit it.  Almost everyone is married and/or has kids.  It's just weird.  And I'm getting really twangy.  If I talked to any of you, you'd all laugh at me.  It's bad.  

Ohh, this NFL offseason is killing me.  Two of the Packers' outstanding offensive linemen are gone!  Oh Rivera and Wahle, we'll miss you.  That line had been together for quite sometime, so I think that it will be difficult to get that chemistry and teamwork back by the start of the season."

So...first week on the job.  Not really too bad.  I feel like I got tossed in there with no instruction at all though.  I'm apparently supposed to have a shirt, but I have yet to receive one, which is just as well because I'd very much prefer to wear my own stuff.  Also, I need to take a test to get my own money?  Right...I'm going to ask about that one on Tuesday because I close by myself on Wednesday.  Insanity.  I'm getting the hang of everything, but I don't really know all that much about the hotel other than the spa.  The girl who I work with most of the time has had her job for 8 years, so I think that she just does things and forgets to slow down and tell me what's going on.  But she's really helpful when I have a question.  I think that when I work on Tuesday, I'm going to get a hot stone massage because we have absolutely no appointments.  I've also sold some products and I get 5% commission on them.  Sweet!  The downside...the whole freakin hotel smells like sulfur because the town has a bunch of sulfur springs.  And we have mineral baths in the spa and even though they have 20 other minerals and aromatherapy oils, they still smell like rotten eggs.  

I've found an over-the-counter treatment that helps the anxiety attacks.  It's called Nerve Tonic and it's homeopathic.  I'm still kinda afraid to push myself too far though...a big part of the panic attacks is me freaking out about getting sick in public--most of the times when I eat, I get sick.  So this has been a problem.  I'll take the medicine and try to eat a little before work, but then I'm totally afraid to eat when I'm at work because I'm scared that maybe the pills will have worn off and I'll start feeling badly, then have a panic attack and not be able to really do anything about it (go home).  Plus, the break room always seems to have a lot of people in it and that makes me anxious by itself..let alone trying to eat.  Blahhhhhh...I'm feeling ok though, so I'm hoping that I'll just take a little more time to adjust and then be able to function normally.

I didn't get the Mervyn's job.  And I just got an email about it!  I'm kind-of offended that I didn't get a real letter.  I still have applications pending with Gap and May Co., so maybe one of those will turn out ok."

"event","So, today I went to start my first day at the spa job.  Total mess.  Lately (the past 2 months) I've been having panic attacks (maybe) whenever I go anywhere.  I get really nervous, my heart starts beating really fast, my stomach knots up, I get dizzy, and I feel like I'm going to be sick.  It's not so bad when I'm with someone else though.  But it's still a big pain!  I tell myself that I'm fine and that there's nothing to worry about, but I still freak out.  It happened this morning at the hotel.  I eventually calmed down and was able to complete all of my paperwork.  But then I went to the spa area and freaked out again, so I'm going to start on Monday.  It's just as well because I need to buy some new shoes for the job.

I think that my Mervyn's interview went pretty well (knock on wood).  The recruiters were really cool and it sounds like a really nice company.  I'll know about that within the next two weeks.  My mom totally does not want me to move anywhere that's more than 50 miles away.  She gets upset and stops talking whenever I talk about moving somewhere even though she knows that I really don't like living here.

Ohh..my little brother got arrested for drinking...again.  He wrecked a girl's car and fled the scene.  But one of the state troopers here really likes him, so he came to our house to find the bro after the wreck.  He was arrested in the driveway.   He goes to court on Monday.

I have been so damn bored lately.  There is just nothing to do.  My friend Gabe may be visiting from Colorado in the next few weeks...but, I'm not sure if I really want to hang out with him.  It would definitely be something to do and I'd probably see some other people I haven't seen in years, but Gabe did kinda have a thing for me and he grabbed my ass all the time...so hanging out would probably lead to something awkward.  I haven't talked to anyone from Bloomington very much in the past month.  But that's my fault too...although I really don't like to be the one to initiate conversation, even with my friends, because I have the mindset that ""well, if they wanted to talk to me they would, so I'm not going to bother them.""  Whatever weirdo.  

On the plus side, there are quite a few good shows coming up.  Brother Ali Saturday night, but I probably won't make it to that one because I have no one to go with me.  Atmosphere in Bloomington and Louisville next week....I should be heading to the Lville show as long as the guys make a decision!  Aesop Rock is coming to Bloomington in April.  And I'm sure that more shows will be announced in the next few weeks.  So if anyone wants to go to these, definitely let me know.

And..my hair has grown out a little bit.  I can tell a slight difference.  Everyone that's seen the hair really likes it, but I still hate it...although not as much as right after the cut.  At least the ponytail is workin."

I hope that I'll be able to make it to the Brickyard 400 this year.  I didn't even really think about it until my dad automatically didn't include me when talking about how many tickets we needed for the Indy 500 and the 400.  No matter what, I'll still be around for the 500 because all the retail training programs don't start until June or July, and I hope that I'll either be close enough to Indy to go to the 400 or have enough money to fly in for it.

I didn't get the Carson's job, but I do have an interview with Mervyn's on Thursday.  I also got the job (as long as the references check out--we all know that Barb hates me..haha) at the spa.  Ohh, I get all the treatments for free as part of my training.  Massages, facials, scrubs, wraps.  Heaven!  I think that I'll start on Friday, but HR is going to call me tomorrow, so I'll see what's up then.  I'll probably go shopping this week too, so I can buy some clothes for work...even though I don't know about the dress code yet.  I'm hoping that I don't have to wear a uniform shirt or anything.

I got the cutest shoes last week.  They're Puma ballet flats with cutouts on the sides.  Khaki with lime green stripes and logos.  Very comfortable and a lot more stylish than my old New Balances.  I also bought a pair of the khaki ballet flats with the flower on the toe from Gap."

Today, I again ventured out and applied for a part time job.  It's as a desk clerk at a spa in a hotel.  Something I can definitely do with little to no stress.  The people should be friendly and I can't imagine that the place would be terribly busy at the moment.

The stylist even asked if it shrank up a lot and I told her that it did!  I can barely put it in a ponytail!  And I live for ponytails on bad hair days!  This is seriously the shortest hair I've had since kindergarten......and all of my classmates remember that haircut because it was so short and poufy and fro-y.  I guess that the only positive about this is that it's January, so I don't have to worry about humidity for another 4 months.  Hopefully by then it will be a decent length.  Ohh, what I would give for a time machine (not only to fix the hair, but for some other stuff as well but that's a whole other journal entry)."

I'm surprised that my dad hasn't told me to get a part-time job while I'm waiting on something full-time in my field.  Maybe he realizes that there aren't really any jobs to be had here, and if there is something, I probably wouldn't do it.  Sloth to the max.

The birthday was Tuesday.  23 sounds weird.  The bro's birthday is Friday...18.  He wants to get a tattoo of our last name on his back and he's chosen a place in town for this, totally disregarding my advice.  He wants me to go check out the letters he's picked out....I just have a feeling that this place will be really sketchy.  Blah..but maybe if I go and tell him that it's horrible, he'll reconsider.  I can't tell him not to get a tattoo since I have 3, but I do think that he should wait a while longer to think about it."

We had about two to three feet of snow here on Wednesday...all by Thursday morning.  It's insane!  I've never seen this much snow before.  It's deeper than our dog is tall (and he's not a small puppy..he weighs 90 pounds).  Plus, it's so cold.  As I'm writing this it's 16 below zero.  Brr!

In other news...it's Christmas!  But I need to get to bed so I can get up for my presents.  The fam went to my Uncle and Aunt's house tonight..my little cousins are too adorable.  Two boys, ages 2 and 4.  They are definitely something else and they have an older sister who's 10.  They did not want to go to bed, even though they were exhausted.  My poor cousin Heather is way stressed because the kids were screaming and crying and she still has to wrap all their presents.  Eek!"

"event","..until De La Soul at The Bird.  Who wants to go?  Ohhh...did I mention that Aceyalone and Del tha Funky Homosapien will be there the next week?  Yeah...two great shows pretty much back to back.  Awesome, but sad in the fact that they're the only big hip hop shows so far this semester in Bton.  So much for going out with a bang.  Anyway, some of you folks will have to go with me.  Indeed."

"event","I almost plummeted to my death tonight.  Ok, so not really, but my heel did catch on a stair and I did almost fall down the stairs head first and I very well could have twisted, sprained or broken my ankle.  Thankfully, none of these things happened."

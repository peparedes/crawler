Your<br>exactly what calm, cool, and collected mean.<br>You never overreact or panic in a bad situation<br>and you always know what to do. Everyone goes<br>to you for advice because you never lose your<br>head so your very reliable. You tend to take<br>everything in stride, like in school your moto<br>is just sit back and relax not to say you dont<br>pay attention and work, but you dont overexert<br>yourself. Even though people come to you for<br>counciling(sp?) you can still be very quite,<br>your not good with making new friends, but your<br>extremely close to the ones you have.  Remember<br>its ok to put your emotions out there even<br>though there is a chance they might get hurt.<br>Also in school sometimes its good to stress out<br>a little, just because you think you dont need<br>to study doesnt mean you should'nt, and also<br>try to push yourself more even though you might<br>be good where you are doesnt mean you can,t be<br>better.

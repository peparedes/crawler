hung out with jonathan and charlotte
went to thousand oaks and set up a zip line
popped myself in the face
split the skin next to my eye
[i think it makes me look like a badass]


today....

woke up 20 minutes before i was supposed to be at work
worked for 6 hours
taught a class of 8 people[never supposed to be more than 5]
realized i'm working a metric assload of hours over the summer
went and hung out with jack
and ray for a bit
and des for a bit
chilled with paul at movie express
came home
at 10
realized andrew un-blocked me from lj
was pleased

now it is time for bed

i feel young



i came to the realization that i'm actually ready for college
boston...here i come bitcheses!

friday night was the slumber party at iron works
it was super fun
we slept in a fort made out off all the crash pads
and had epic battles in the air
and swung off the top of the bouldering wall

hung out with dylan and jonathan all day saturday
found jesse
the kids were tired so we took them home
then we decided to go to santa cruz

went to santa cruz
found fizz, phil, mouse, and sparky
ate lots of good food
slept at the armory
got up this morning and went to ucsc
its really pretty

"event","yesterday <b>sucked</b> like oh my god



keep in mind: this happened at 7 pm
broad daylight
with people around



so......
me, elizabeth, jonathan, and peter hung out at the gym till it closed
we called jesse and met him at the hat place cuz jonathans stuff was in his trunk
after food we gnabbed yoshi at eudemonia
he had to take his bike home and devin/jack needed a ride
we decided to meet up at ohlone park

<i>that was a very very bad idea</i>

the 6 of us get to ohlone park and are just fucking around
jesse wanders a way for a minute [to the water fountain or something of that nature]
and is followed back by two black dudes
they try to start shit with jesse and yoshi
it doesnt work
we decide to leave and meet at the cemetary
jesse and yoshi cross the street to go to his car
they are still being harassed
the rest of us follow a bit behind
because we had to get peters shoe out of the tree
as soon as we get to the sidewalk on the other side of the street
we see one guy grab yoshis head phones
yoshi starts screaming
he gets socked in the face
and goes down
straight onto his forehead
jesse gets punched a second later
and also goes down
but not as hard
the dudes run
some of the neighbors come out and call the police
yoshi doesnt know where he is and cant remember what happened
the police come
the fire department come
the paramedics come
the crime scene unit comes
they catch the dudes a few blocks away
they are dumb and went home
one apparently is well known by the berkeley police
yoshi is taken by ambulance to the hospital
the other 5 of us give police reports
3 of us are taken to i.d. the guys
they take us back and eventually let us leave
jonathan and elizabeth get picked up by parents
peter gets a ride home from a cop
i take jesse to the e.r.
because hes bleeding from a gash next to his eye
we wait for 5.5 hours before he is admitted
it takes 2 hours for them to get around to fixing him
yoshi left the hospital around 1.30 am
we waited for jesse till 4
they are both fine
sore
but fine


my saturday night sucked
to say the least

i bought 14 gauge earrings today for all 4 of my holes
and holy mother of god
stretching your ears fuckin hurts
apparently my ears dont stretch easily at all
going from 18 to 14 isnt painful for most people
so you cant find 16 gauge earrings

holy mother of god
my ears are throbbing
especially the right one
both holes are being stretched at the moment
only my bottom hole on the left is being mollested at the moment
that should be changed though
so i guess im off to cause myself more pain :'("

but there is no jesse yet...
im slightly confused
only slightly though

his brother was bitchy to me
i said happy birthday to him

everyones birthday was yesterday
its crazy

senior pictures went well
i think
i am wearing tons of makeup
it feels odd
but i look pretty

i want to go to the beach
but i cant swim for another week
cuz of my tatoo
its worth it though

speaking of swimming
i need to start training for the tri
at least i have till september
people should come down to monterey with us
that's where it is
i get to swim a mile
open water
its gonna be freezing
at least we wear wetsuits

i wanna learn how to surf
i used to know how
but was never any good
i dont remember how any more
that's disappointing

i need to go to the gym
i feel lazy
i dont work till monday
that is disappointing
i work all next week
9-12
summercamp
i wonder what that will be like

i want some malibu
coconut rum
one of the few coconutty things i enjoy
me lyzi kate and alyse drank a bottle
while we were in france
and danced
in our skivvies
it was entertaining

speaking of france
we toured with people from montana
they were silly
some of them were pretty cool
others were assholes
i hope michelle comes to visit
she was really nice

i wish we had gotten to hang out with the ohio boys
for longer than just a few hours
they were silly
and had cool stuff to talk about

i think jesse is home finally
i will go then...."

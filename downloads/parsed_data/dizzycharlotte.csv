Awesome that his insurance doesn't kick in until December 1st, so we have to wait a while until he can see a doctor. I just need to take care of him until then.

Time has just been flying by. 5 months until our wedding is 1 year away. And 1 year to plan a wedding isn't really all that long. Ah. I don't even know where to BEGIN. Holy cow. I'm just so glad that my life is going in the direction I want it to. Last time I went through this thing, I read all these entries about not being sure of things and always being lonely even when I had ""someone"". I've seriously never felt that way with Alex. It hasn't always been easy and we've DEFINITELY had our times when we've wanted to drop kick the shit out of each other, but actually, things have improved since we moved in together, as odd as that is. I love being around him all the time. I live with my best friend! What more could a girl ask for? :D

"event","Yesterday's storm was amazinggg. Alex & I were on our way to the gym but decided that it was too much of a waste to be indoors when it WASN'T 110 degrees outside. So we went running along the canal in the rain. Even though it was just the canal behind our apartment, it was gorgeous. I loved every second of it...except the smwarms of bugs. Hah. I'm pretty sure one went up my nose. :x

I'm really excited because I'm applying to be a reading tutor for kids through this organization I found. & I'm trying my hardest to help Sarah with her non-profit organization. I just feel like I need to be doing something to help others. It feels good to be active.

I realized last night that I have 3 whole semesters left of school (not counting having to take summer & winter classes). That's so amazing. Hah. And then I'm getting married & then grad school. Bah. Life really does come at you fast. But I'm loving it. I love where I'm at right now. It's pretty much perfect for me. :D

Ok. I need FOOD.

Andddd I need to see old friends. The end of summer is approching us."

"event","Last night Lo came over & we had a wedding planning night, full of margaritas, my zillions of wedding magazines, & google searches. Hah. It made me realize just exactly HOW much I have to get done. Holy crap.

Good news though. I'm pretty sure Alez & I set a date. March 14, 2009. It sounds far away & yeah it IS 20 months into the furture, but for everything I need to get done, it seems like a week. Hah. I'm trying to be as CHEAP as possible without having a curtain as a backdrop and a keg of bud light. Everything that I want seems to be WAY too expensive though...damn my tastes.

I'm thinking we may have found a venue. The Phoenix Art Museum. It's really pretty if you set it up right & the caterers that they prefer seem pretty good. I figure we have to sacrifice the money for the location because we have such a huge list of people. Like....250 or so. And we have to book a place at LEAST a year ahead of time. 

Ahhhhh!!!! I don't know WHY this is stressing me out so much but it is. Not in a bad way because it's all excitement...but I just feel like I'm going to get into this & not know what to do next. & the only friend that I know who has gotten married is Kourt & she pretty much got everything that she wanted because Blake's family is rich. Haha. So I need some advice as to how to save save save but still have a gorgeous wedding. I guess I just have a lot of research to do. Which isn't half bad...I have the time. Hah.

Ah Gah. I should probably be worrying about school before this wedding. It starts in like...3 weeks. Bah. Not too thrilled for having to drive to Tempe twice a week...wake up in time to be down there & in class by 7:40AM. Ughhh. But I'm really excited about this volunteer program I found. It's to tutor kids at an elementary school once a week. Alex & I are both going to apply. I'm super excited. I hope they pick me!!! :D

Haha. Ok. I need to get off the computer. I'm on one all day at work. I'm sure it's bad for me."

"event","It's storming like crazy right now. Bahh. I wish Allie was here. I love our apartment but it's kind of scary because the storm makes creepy noises and there's a canal right behind us. Hah. I'm such a big baby. I couldn't call asleep last night cuz I thought I heard people whispering outside our bedroom door. I swear I'm constantly thinking I'm going to get killed. I need to stop watching scary movies.

I'm completely in LOVE with our apartment. I love everything about it. It's so cute. :) And I LOVE living with Alex. It's seriosuly the best thing ever. This is exactly where I want to be. I never get sick of him. It's pretty pathetic actually...Hah. But I love my life right now. I have everything that I could have ever asked for. :)

I'm so excited about this Friday. Lo is coming over & we're drinking wine & going through wedding magazines. I love that she's so excited about my wedding. Even though it's a little under 2 years away, I have a feeling the time is going to fly by. Before I know it, I will be a little ol housewife. Haha. Yeah....rightttt.

I've been trying to look into finding some organizations to volunteer for. Mainly ones that are environmental. I feel like the little things we do don't make enough of a difference. We bought all new light bulbs, buy only recycled toilet paper & paper towels, & recycle, but it just doesn't seem like close to enough. I want to work my tail off to make an impact. I need to look harder I think.

Haha I'm supposed to go to the gym when Alex gets here, but so far I've been on the computer eating flaming hot cheetos. Mmmm.

Ok. Degrassi time. <3"

They don't know when or who got it or even from where, but since we live together, I could've gotten it from the couch if she had it yesterday. So I had to go out and buy the lice killing shampoo and then, when she gets home, we have to clean the entire apartment and wash EVERYTHING. 

Leaves no real time for studying. Hah. Grand. My head itches but I think I'm just making it all up. I really hope I don't have it though...Bah!"

I should be studying. Seriously. I have a final on Thursday that I haven't even BEGUN to study for. It's ridiculous how stressed I am, yet I find time to mess around on here and MySpace. Ugh.

I need a job SO badly. I applied to be an Accounts Receivable Specialist and Janice sent me a reference for a job to be an Accounts Receivable Analyst...but I'm just scared that I'm not qualified enough. Hrm. I'm broke though, so I guess there's no harm in trying.

"event","<small>Wow. I seriously am in total shock still. Hah. Alex and I always talked about getting married and KNEW it was going to happen, and KNEW he was going to propose, but when it actually happens, it's like surreal. Being a girl, I always envisioned how perfect it would be, and Alex topped it. Just the fact that he went through so much so plan it and have Sarah help him...and that he was SO nervous even though he knew my answer. Haha. I was so happy I couldn't even cry. slfhofhsdodcojpod. I'm SO incredibly happy. I couldn't imagine being any happier than I am right now. My ring is GORGEOUS and I can't stop looking at it. And I have the perfect fiance. :)

And mostly I'm so greatful for my friends, cuz they've all been SO amazing. They all are so happy for me and I love. Although it's a bit of a let down that some that I thought would be the most excited for me and the most interested end up not even really seeming to care...I guess that's something that I kind of expected. Sad but true. But I'm SO effin thankful for those who can share in my excitement.

I just need to make sure I don't turn into a BRIDEZILLA. Ugh."

I have to park on the street side of our apartment tonight because we're getting the asphalt repaved or something...? I don't know, but it's reall inconvenient and making me angry.

Now I have exams in all my classes and it' proving to be a very stressful period. Ugh. Only what...5 more years of this? No problem. :/

I still have nothing for Valentine's Day, although I do have ideas. Thank God we set a cheap spending limit because life without a job is pretty nonprofitable. I'm broke.

This little apartment is pretty lonely. It's days like this that I wish I lived in a dorm just so there's not so much isolation. Or maybe I should just actually make friends. Hah. Like that will happen.

I'm super down for some reason...lately has just been stressful and emotional and I just need something new and exciting to happen to me. But that seems pretty impossible at this point. Life is mostly mundane and I'm sureee that if something spectacular DID happen I would just let it pass by.

I'm done dammit.

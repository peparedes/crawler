  hey, i promised u the secret and i wrote almost 4 pages and it got deleted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO here goes:




                                        THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF HERA!!!
                                            Case of Kim Brown


Hera sadly walked on the bus of her first day of school of 6th grd. Every seat was full except onne so she sat down beside a  big person. hera's fiend was over there and she was allready making a new friend. so hera decided to make her friend jelous too. so she be-friended the person beside of her. 
Hera sufferd a great deal. She didnt like this person so she decided she should get rid of her. She always brought embaresment to hera. Like:

1. had spit on her shirt once at a feild tip to Powell Valley River Project
2. hera felt retarded to walk beside her
3. practicly hugged hera in the hallways (she did)



So hera was sick of it.the only way to get rid of her is to make her tell hera a deep secret. and thats what happend. Kimberlin told hera a secret that shed regret doing forever:


SHE TOLD HERA WHO SHE LIKED!!!
it was Ryan B. in 6th grd.



 
                                                THE END

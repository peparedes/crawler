"event","No, seriously, I'll bet she does. That would be just like her. So hey, here I am again with an update, this time in less than a month after the last one. Without further ado, my past month or so, arranged according to tradition in bullet points, sine bullets.      

- Classes, believe it or not, or whatever, are pretty awesome right now. (Except of course for Greek, where Arieti is requiring about 100 lines of Aristophanes per class period. As soon as I find where he keeps his coffin, I'm driving a stake into his shriveled old heart. And the same goes for Aristophanes. In the immortal words of George III: Mr. Caesar--go to hell.) But yeah, anyway, Latin is decent, Western Culture is tolerable, and my comedy class is just downright fun. Also turns out that the Chorus gets all sorts of cool trips and crap, including a spring break tour in Florida. That's right. Florida.

- I'm also in a new play, called ""Music from a Sparkling Planet,"" which promises to be almost mind-numbingly good. My part is. . .well. . .a complicated one, different from any I've ever done, but I'm feeling pretty confident about it, and hopefully I'll do it justice. Maybe. Oh yeah, and it's a ""main"" part too, so no more sitting backstage for like 3 acts like in Macbeth. (On the other hand, you just can't beat getting to wield a  four-freakin-foot broadsword.)

- IM basketball is also going strong, despite our 0-2 record after getting our heinies handed to us by AXE and the Yellow Jackets. (He. I said ""heinie"") Hopefully, though, Joey will be out of his cast soon after getting maimed in the first game and leaving yours truly to fill in as pointguard. Bleaugh.

So anyway, those are the highlights. I'm getting tired of this whole telling my life story on the Internet thing, so most probably from now on I'll just be posting stuff if it happens to be funny. So there. If you really want the story, or just a good time, call 434-223-6559 and ask for Alex. No, I -- I'm just -- Geez, I'm just kidding. Gosh. Some of you people really need to grow a sense of humor. Sheesh."

"event","Hello again, loyal fanbase! Here I am again with yet another scintillating update for you to slaver over. I probably wouldn't have mustered up the energy to do it, but I just keep getting these threatening e-mails and/or posts. . . (You know who you are, nudge nudge, wink wink.) Anyway, I'm back at HSC now, gettin back in the groove, as it were. (Which, by the way, would be a great name for a band. As it were, I mean.) Got a fairly awesome schedule--consider the following: Latin 305, Greek 308, Art 285 (theatre), Logic 201, Art 251 (Chorus), and Western Culture 102. Not bad for a puny little Freshgeek. Anyway, I've just decided that I don't feel like entertaining you all right now after all, so I'm going to go to SFS basketball. (That's student/faculty/staff, for all you noobs out there.) Oh yeah, and I also want to just officially let everyone know something. I know that there have been a lot of rumors going around, so I figure I'll just settle everything now. Yes, it's true. I absolutely do own Scott at DDR, and have proved it on multiple occasions. Ok. Peathe out. Oh yeah, and anybody who can post the definition of my mood today without looking it up gets mad e-props. (Ugh, I can't believe I just used a word like that. . .I feel dirty. . .next I'll be watching anime or something. . .grody.) Oh yeah, and that's it."

"event","At last, after decades, centuries, eons of waiting--I know it's been two weeks at least--it's time for another update! Fasten your seatbelts, gird up your loins, etc., because we've got a lot of ground to cover. Without further ado, the past two weeks, condensed into bullet points for your convenience! Sine bullet points. Huttah!

-Get this: I'm playing soccer! Seriously. I joined up a couple weeks ago with the IV intra-mural team, and we're rocking everybody's face off, going 5-1 so far and headed for the playoffs. Highlights include the two games we won by forfeit--they were really just scared of us, really--, the one game we won in sudden death penalty kick overtime with a nutmeg on the goalie, and yours truly's earthquaking, bone-shaking, tie-breaking goal against Team Debacle. (On second thought, maybe net-ripping, heart-skipping, and straight-tripping would be better. Yeah, that's more like it.) Look out, Phi-Gam, The Other Team is coming for you. What are you gonna do, huh? WHAT YOU GONNA DO WHEN ALEXMANIA COMES FOR YOU?!?!?!

-In other sports news, the first ever pianoball tournament on Friday was an amazing success. Yours truly once again beasted it up, bringing home a nail-biting, moonlighting, fistfighting, sudden death win in the individual 500-point event. (Or maybe it was butt-kicking, bird-flipping, and finger-licking. Don't stop me now, I'm on a roll.) Check out my profile for a link to the pics, if you're interested. But you knew that. 

-College is awesome, but occasionally you have to do some work. I try not to, but sometimes I just can't help it, a good example being this Thursday when I was forced to pull an all-nighter to finish off. . .well, polish up. . .er. . .ok, do the research for and write a 2000 worder for Rhetoric. Got a 95 on my Greek mid-term, though, so all's well in the world.

-Turning now to domestic issues, I lost my single room this week. Matt just couldn't take his pot-head roommate anymore, so I let him move in with me until Brennan gets rid of Cambell. It's actually kind of fun having a cool roommate for once, even if my room is looking considerably more cluttered than before. Of course, there are now two pot-heads in Matt's old room, and it seems we've created a monster. They've basically turned the place into an opium den. The smell of pot permeates the entire hallway, and I can't even walk up the stairs without getting high before I reach my room. Second-hand marijuana. Nice. I'm going to go in there tonight and beat them both to death with my bicycle pump.

-This weekend, though, was perhaps the awesomest ever. Katie came up for the Macon game, which, incidentally, HSC won 60-15--it was beautiful. She brought a picnic lunch, and we camped out on the grass and watched the carnage. After that, we hung out for a while, then went over to the Manis farm and spent the night with some IV friends, and went to church and lunch with them in the morning. In other words, I basically got to spend almost two days exclusively with her, which hasn't happened in. . .well, in quite a while. Coolness.

Well, that's pretty much it for now--I'll try to stay more regular with these things. Y'all stay cool."

"event","Time again for our weekly fun-time update. For anybody who cares, I'm still sick and coughing, but fast approaching the realm of health again. (N.B.: I still haven't replaced the lung I coughed up this weekend. Right now I'm keeping the old one in an empty Arizona Tea bottle along with some loose change, just to keep it fresh. If my dormies are right, it should fetch enough on eBay to get a dart-board, or at least a beanbag chair. Especially if I offer to throw in the change.) On a lighter note, everybody needs to come and see Macbeth; take my word for it, it's going to be awesome. I get to use both a spear and a sword, and I now officially get the awards for the coolest kill and the most awesome death. Almost as though all this wasn't good enough, we all get to be painted blue when we go into battle. Awesome. (Check out the HSC site for info on showtimes and reservations. It's free, but make sure you reserve a seat, cause there aren't many.) To conclude, here's a really funny picture of some fat guy.

"event","To whom it may concern: In the interest of clarity and logistical excellence, I have decided that the best way to run this journal thing is to update once a week, perhaps on Monday. Furthermore--whaddya know--today is Monday, so I think I'll begin the tradition now and let everybody in on my on the details of my boring and trivial week. C'mon, don't be like that, you know you can't wait. 

To begin: This is a shout-out to whoever stole my bike. Stealing is not a nice thing to do. You should not steal in general, but you definitely should not have stolen from me. Get your affairs in order, because, when I find you, you're in for a world of pain. I will hunt you down and beat the ever-lovin snot out of you. I will shoot spitballs at you when you're not looking. I will steal your nice mint-flavored toothpaste and replace it with that disgusting Arm-and-Hammer baking-soda kind. I will take your mother out for a nice steak and seafood dinner, and then never call her again. I will break your kneecaps. I am coming for you. 

Ahem.

I'm exaggerating a little of course, but I still wish I had my bike back. (Shout-out's over, by the way, so everybody who's not a bike stealer can start reading again. Whaddya mean, you were reading anyway?!) Before, I could get anywhere on campus is under 5 minutes; now, I'm a mere pedestrian again, and sometimes is takes up to 15 minutes, which is way too long for an ADD reject like myself. Sigh. . .

This week was not a total waste however. Inter-Varsity, which has pretty much become the highlight of my week, was a lot of fun, and afterwards we went to Joey and Rich's crib and played Mafia. (I'll get you Scott!! I may always get stuck being the paramedic, but one day I'll get to be the Mafia, and then you'll be the first to sleep with the fishes. Until that day, rest assured that I will never, ever heal you under any circumstances.) On Saturday, I got to go home and hang out with Andy, who is a good friend and has never accused me of being the Mafia just for giggles. We went to see The Forgotten with my girlfriend, who, by the way, is the most awesomest in the universe, the best I've ever had, and most likely better than yours. (Don't get me wrong, it's not that I know your girlfriend or anything; I'm just saying, statistically speaking, the odds aren't good for you.) Anyway, after that Katie went home and me and Andy and my brother hung out at my house and watched Office Space, which is a much better movie than the Forgotten, even if it does lack aliens.

That's pretty much it for this week, and besides, I have dinner to eat and homework to do. Tune in next time. You stay classy, Farmville. Peace out."

"event","You know in all those movies and books and stuff, where you hear about how somebody leaves for an hour and when they get back the person they were living with is packed up and gone? The vast majority of the time that makes people sad, and they go back to their lonely house, in which the empty corners where their beloved's possessions used to be are like the gaping mouths of coffins waiting to ingest the souls of the dying. (Just call me Alex ""The Noirmeister"" Mayberry.) Well, that just happened to me, except I loathed the person who was here, and now that they're gone I just want to run around in little circles and yell ""Cecilia"" by Simon and Garfunkle while, I dunno, zapping random people with the exposed wires of an electric toothbrush or something. (This, for me, is a happy thing.)

Before you jump to conclusions, let me give you the skinny. Up till tonight, I had a roommate named Cyrus Alberston. Cyrus Albertson, in a nutshell, was a white prep-boy from Chevy Chase who at the same time thought he was black and tried to act as ghetto as possible. I don't know how many times I've wanted to just go up to him and say, ""Cyrus, listen man, don't take this the wrong way, but the whole Gangsta Lacrosse thing just isn't working for you--you need to drop it."" Loser.

Anyway, we had absolutely nothing in common; we literally literally never spoke more than 1 or 2 sentences to each other. Like, the entire 6 weeks we've been here. Plus, he used to do the most random and creepy stuff you can imagine. Example: Last week, he came running in here at about 11 at night, dead drunk, accompanied by some guy in a Batman suit. Yeah, that's right. A Batman suit. I had heard rumors that he was about to move out or something, but of course he never mentioned it to me, so imagine my surpirse and delight when I went out to the debates tonight and came back to find nothing but the trash he left behind. I mean, he took everything: all his sheets, clothes, books, pictures, everything. This is at least the eighth-happiest day of my life. . .

Well, I'm going to go optimize all these gigantic amounts of space that I have now. This is totally awesome! Peace out.

Just so you guys know. Because I know you were all worried and stuff, after reading my post this morning. . .yeah, ok, so nobody actually reads this, but hey, you know, I can dream. Anyway, peace out, I'll post again when I have something interesting to say."

"event","Hello, Internet. This is my first ever post. Bask in the Majesty that is the journal of me.

Seriously, though, here it is, and you should enjoy it, because it's probably the only one I'll ever write. If however, I decide to keep writing, I'll probably get in the habit, and then you'll be treated to all sorts of cool and useless information about how I'm feeling, what I did that day, etc., etc. For instance, as I write this journal, I can tell you that the coolest thing I did this weekend was to play paintball. The following are some of the highlights.

-Running around Carp X looking for PK who ending up not coming anyway
-Seeing Bryan and Philip who are both still back home
-Playing some huge big course and getting owned both games because my mask was intensely fogged and I couldn't see a thing
-Destroying some guy's soul with my flying plastic orbs of doom through the window of the TerrorDrome
-Shooting his fat buddy who proceeded to fall down and cry. Loser. Hehehe.
-Poking my head out like a nOOb and getting shot in the throat. Ouch.
-Watching my 15 year-old brother infiltrate the TerrorDrome and eat Brennan's soul with his SpecOps moves. Bwa ha ha! Dat boy's got skills.
-Playing the rest of the day and earning the nickname ""Bloodlust"" on account of my apparently eerie battle laugh. Go figure. >:)
-Going home with a manly welt on my bulging forearm as a proof to everyone of my infinite virility.

So there ya go. More to come, I guess."

"event","Well I did it.... I quit both of my jobs.... I was kind of sad to leave one, but I think I'll be okay with it. I made sure I let the one person I actually cared about there know I was leaving... Though I just up and quit both jobs, it looks like I may have another one in the bag.... I asked for an application and she practically gave me a mini interview on the spot. When I took my application back today she did the same thing. Apparently after I left she was talking about me and asking the other girls there what they thought of me. Pretty good signs, don't you think?"

"event","Well let's see, things still going back, but tomorrow I'm quitting my stupid f*cking job, which I'm terrified to do. Though, it's what I do, I'm a quitter... In the middle of all of this drama I decided I needed a haircut. Something simple, maybe just a trim with a few new layers. Well here I am, I took off 6 inches (please, no penis jokes, those will come later), tons of layers and DAMN am I cute. Though I am now not just a normal amount of cuteness, but an unmeasurable amount of cuteness, the happiness just isn't there.... I hate being sad, I've never been sad, I guess a bad job brings out the worst in you. Here's hoping that within the next two weeks the two jobs I have now are gone and a nice more mellow job has taken its place. I suppose I could quit whining, though there are a million different things upsetting me at the moment that I could go on about... Okay, like a couple, but still... Away I go to cuddle with my new pillow...."

"event","Well, last night was, in a word..... magical.... My pillow is awesome.... So far only one problem, it's a little too fluffy to fully get my leg around, but that will improve with time.... Well the police tech job has been applied for, here's hoping I'll get it! If not, well, then I don't and move on with my life. My two weeks notice was supposed to go in today, just not enough hours in the day.... There's always Wednesday... I shall be off, more job applications to fill out and a f*ck off letter to write.... Have a nice day!"

I've never been so excited to go to sleep! Well, except for Christmas Eve, but that SO doesn't count, lol. It really is fabulous.... Who knew a pillow could make my day?"

"event","So, my plans for the next few hours, I have a project.... Here's the back story... I have a beloved body pillow, I sleep with it every night, it travels with me, I love it. Well, as of late, he has become flat and stained, really rather pathetic. So today, wandering around Wal Mart, I come across body pillows for 9 dollars, body pillow covers for 6, but they just weren't doing it for me. That's when it hits me, two yards of Ryan Newman fabric for 7.36$.... Once the spool of fabric was grabbed, I walked to the fabric lady with a huge smile plastered on my face, and I had what would be my new snuggle buddy.... So here I am, getting ready to bust out the sewing machine and make my new pillow. Not only will this be made of the fabulous Ryan Newman fabric, it will BIGGER and FLUFFIER, sort of like the real thing ;). With that being said, away I go, hooray for NASCAR....."

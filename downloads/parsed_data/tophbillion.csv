"event","So Friday was my last day at Boocoo.  I had saturday off.  I havent had a saturday off in a long time.  So Im hanging out in DTRO with Kat and we decide to eat at Quiznos for dinner, I have a Club w/bacon, Then we go bowling.  Half way through the second game Im not feeling so hot.  We finish up our three games then go back to my apt.  I then proceed to have the most violent regurgitation process I have ever witnessed.  I then decide Im going to try to Sleep while Kat watches TV.  She then visits the bathroom and does the same thing I did.  Now its about 5:00 am,  Neither of us can even hold water down and Kats Mom suggest we visit the good old ER.  Half hour later Kat and I and next to each other on Saline drips till 9:00 am.  Could you ask for a better day off, I think not.  

In case you are wondering I did report it to the Oakland County Health Dept."

"event","How goes everybody who reads this?
Myself, I am doing great.  I got meself a new job.  I will now be cooking over at 220 in Birmingham.  I get a wonderful 3 dollar raise (with opportunities for more), health insurance, 401K, and opportunity for paid vacation.  It will be nice because, if anyone keeps up with the Metro Detroit restaurant industry which I doubt you do, The wonderful Chef Shawn Mac was fired and replaced the a money making chef.  This guy is a huge shoe maker.  I may know more about culinary art then he does.  Anyways I would not recommend eating a Boocoo anymore because his menu sucks, might as well just go to Olive Garden.  

MMM... rant that most people wont understand.

I still have not been out skiing yet this season but if anyone wants to (ie Ben) give me a ring so we can.
Other than that all is good in the R.O. ,or actually Troy, front.

Hope you enjoyed this, now its time for some counterstrike."

Well i am 98% settled in to the apt now.  The only thing left is 2 people to move out so I get my storage space for all my other crap that I don't use on a regular basis.
I have been without the internet for a few days now due to billing switches and having to buy a router but now it is back (obviously) and stronger than ever,  hell yeah 802.11g.

If anyone remembers or even reads this I wrote a bit ago that shit may be going down at work. Aka people leaving or being fired.  Well it has begun.  One sous chef has been fired over an argument about a ramekin.  I really not sure how that happened.  Also our  pastry chef gave his 2 weeks  and rumors are that all 3 front of house managers are leaving in one fashion or another.  Any ways I am metaphorically grabbing the bull by the horns (""but that really did happen"") and am going after the sous chef position.  Being a sous chef at the restaurant of the year at age 20 would look damn good on a resume.

If the sous chef thing falls through than I am learning how to be a bartender.  I am working on getting my certification now. Fun stuff happening in Chris land.  Its going to be a rough few months."

In other news I went to the ER yesterday.  I decided it wold be fun at work to spill 500 degree rendered duck fat on my index finger.  Boy was I wrong, It wasent fun at all.  As it turns out I have first degree over most of my finger, a patch of second degree over the second nuckle, and in the center of that a bit of 3rd degree.  Yay lack of feeling in part of my finger.  So my finger in semi swollen and hard to use and i need to find out how to file for workmens comp.

Im really tired but for some dumb reason im not in bed.  
We have a health inspection at work tommorow and a had to clean the entire back kitchen with a toothbush.  Mind you that is an exageration but the back kitchen is about 3/4 of the whole kitchen including coolers, freezer, dry storage, equiptment storage, tables, sinks, tilt kettles, and varios other large equiptment.

I have the day off tommorow so I can go to the Curiosa festival.  Yay Muse.  That is going to rock.

Lets see,  My lip is now sore and swollen again because I put in new and totaly different jewlery.  Its a j bar, pretty self explanitory,  but it is completly changing the shape of the piercing.  Other than the swelling it looks damn cool.

Doom 3 still rocks my world and scares the crap out of me at night.

well im off to read the 4th harry potter and ice my lip in hopes the swelling and sorness will go away."

Well I thought I was going to get more hours and harder work but I was sadly mistaken.  I do have harder work.  They have me coming in on wednesdays which is when our fish comes in.  Yay fish butchery.  They still only have me on 4 days a week.  You need 5 or 35 hours for insurance.  I shake my fist at you Boocoo.

Today I went with Kat to get her Tattoo or Tattoos.  They look awesome.  I am envious so I am getting an industrial tomorrow.  (I have wanted it before, I was just inspired to get it done now).  Ill try to remember to post picks.

My parents leave on Saturday for the Michigander bike trip.  I want to go but I need to work.  So I get the house to myself for a week,  Party time!  But not really because my mom and sister may be reading this,  ::waves to family members::

Good news on the work end of my life.  I sat down with ""Chef"" the other day and I will be, hopefully soon, doing more skillful sous chef like work with more hours.  

More hours, good?  Yes very more hours = qualify for health insurance
also more hours = more money = move out sooner = yay

If you havent noticed I am ready to move out.  I love my parents dearly but having never gone away to college I am ready to get away for a while.  I just need to find a cheap place and roomates.

Wow I avent updated in a while.  Where to begin?  Well first I just turned the big 20 on friday.  I then proceeded to celebrate with a nice long day of work.

working backwards, work is starting to look up.  I have been ""promoted"" from hot apps to roasted meats, this got me a wopping 50 cent raise.  Look out Bill gates Im cathing up.  In other work news almont the entire staff may be turned over.  For the past four days the manager has had meetings with the owners, and they are not happy with the job the head chef and both sous chefs are doing.  I can only hope that in the future my skills can be used to thier full potential, aka sous chef.  Also we may lose most of our mexicans due to legalities.

that was quite a rant for me.  Anyways I also got my lip pierced hopfully a picture will be coming shortly"

On a happier note I don't work tomorrow so I think after I do the funeral thing I will go climbing.  I haven't gone in a while which is kinda bad.  If not climbing then I will go for a bike ride.  Have to start training for the michigander.

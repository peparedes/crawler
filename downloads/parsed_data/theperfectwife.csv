"event","I've had a horrible day so far. I woke up yet again to a horn honking outside the house. I turn my air conditioner off at night and sleep with the windows open. My bedroom is in the front of the house so someone laying on the horn repeatedly is something I can definitely hear. I look out and guess who it was. My stepfather. And there was my brother Josh getting into his car and driving off with him. I've been in a bad mood all day because of it.

Then stupidly I decided to watch ""The war zone."" I haven't watched it in a while. I first heard about it when Marilyn Manson mentioned it on his site. It won a bunch of awards. I decided to check it out. Not as easy as I thought it would be. You couldn't buy it anywhere. I went to a million stores. Then I went to a bunch of rental places and couldn't find it there either. I finally found a video copy and Hollywood Video and I rented it. I watched it immediately when I got home. It got to me in a way no other movie ever has. I've seen many movies that center around molestation and rape. The difference with this movie is that it's seen through the eyes of a young fourteen year old boy. The first half hour of the film is basically just a scene of a typical family. They seem close. They seem happy. That's why what happens is so awful. Tom witnesses some sort of sexual scene between his father and his older seventeen year old sister Jessi. He walks by the bathroom window and sees something that disturbs him. What he sees isn't shown. All you see is the look on his face afterwards. He confronts his sister who denies that anything is going on. But he doesn't believe her. He sees his sister going into an old bunker building one day and decides to hide a video camera under some rocks next to the building. A few days later Jessi leaves. Fifteen minutes later the phone rings just once and then his father decides to go for a run. Tom follows him to the bunker. He gets out the camera and props it in one of the holes in the wall. They do show what happens this time. It's horribly graphic. It's not the rape itself that is so bad. It's Jessi crying and begging her father to stop that makes it so awful. Tom is so upset by this scene he throws the camera in the ocean and goes home crying the whole time. He confronts Jessi later and she just cries. It doesn't all come out until baby Alice gets sick. For some reason she's bleeding into her diapers and they rush her to the hospital. It isn't said what is wrong with her. But they show the diapers and you think automatically that the father had to have done something to her. Tom goes to see his mother and the baby in the hospital and he doesn't say anything except that she shouldn't trust his father. Tom gets home to find Jessi crying and the confrontation takes place. Naturally their father denies everything. He hits Tom repeatedly. Jessi eventually speaks up and confronts him as well. And still he denies it all. Tom can't take it anymore. He grabs a knife and stabs his father in the stomach. You don't know what happens after that. You don't know if their father dies. You don't know anything. It ends with Jessi and Tom holding each other and crying. It's Tom that gets to me. He's so upset and so destroyed by what his father does to his sister. That's what makes me break down. That's the way a brother should feel. That's how a brother should react to such a thing. It's what I've always wanted. Instead I have a brother who seeks out a relationship with the man who hurt me. That's what breaks my heart."

"event","Strangely enough as much as I went on and on about the book in my previous entry I've not yet finished it. For some unknown reason I was compelled to pick up ""The perfect wife"" yet again. I'd gotten to page twenty-seven before my eyes turned into gushing faucets. It seems like the more I read it the more it upsets me. So why do I keep going back for more? Because truth be told it's my ultimate fantasy. Oh, I have many fantasies about love. I have tons of scenarios I've read in books that I've acted out in my mind with me as the main character. It's not easy though. I can't seem to remake the image in my mind to be modeled after me instead of the female lead herself. I can't get past it. I picture the male lead and I can't put myself with him. There's just no possible way I could ever be seen by anyone as desirable. So for me the fantasies aren't at all realistic so I can't get into them. What happens in this book I love so dearly is exactly what I wish would happen to me. And I can see myself as Ann in so many ways. She's fat. She's ugly. She's a total reject. She has one friend. The rest of the <i>ton</i> treats her as if she's invisible. She's a spinster. She goes to balls and no one dances with her. She sits in the corner with the older women acting as chaperones and pretends she's there because she chose to be. That she doesn't want to dance or be noticed period. Sarcastic and cutting remarks are made about her by the young debutants, made in her presence as if by accident yet all know they are said loudly so everyone especially Ann will hear. Then all of a sudden Henry Owens drops into town. He's rich and eligible and considered the catch of the season. And who does he pay attention to? Ann and no other. She has faith in him while no one else does. They all think he's up to something. Everyone but Ann. She's elated. Suddenly the girl she sees in the mirror, her own reflection is different. Henry paying so much attention to her and seemingly seeking only her out gives her a much needed boost of self esteem. Suddenly she feels beautiful for the first time in her life. Her own parents treat her as though she's not even related to them. All her sisters are thin and beautiful and her family looks at her as if she's the odd one out. Like she doesn't belong. They are ashamed of her. But they can't bring her down anymore. She doesn't heed any warnings given to her. She believes fully that Henry loves her. Accept he doesn't. His grandfather owns and refuses to let him have his childhood summer home. To Henry who lost his parents years earlier Sea scape is the last place he felt happy. He wants to feel that way again and he'll do anything to get his beloved home back. But his grandfather won't just hand it to him. He hates the place and expresses it constantly yet he refuses to let Henry have it either. It also happens to be falling apart. It's on a cliff near the ocean and every year the foundation is slowly sinking. Soon the house itself will sink. The only way Henry can get the house is to marry. When he does so the house will be deeded to him. But he doesn't want to be married. He needs a temporary wife. One who will marry him and not have a problem with him walking out immediately after. He doesn't want a true marriage. But who would be desperate enough to accept such a bargain? Only an ugly, fat misfit. So Henry chooses Ann and she has absolutely no idea what is about to happen to her. She receives warning yet again from her family. She doesn't listen. Nothing can bring her down. Her wedding day is the happiest day of her life. At the reception Henry suddenly receives a letter concerning some family emergency which he has to leave town immediately to rectify. He expresses his regret and remorse and Ann believes him. He also suggests she stay with her family and then move into his home once he returns in a few days. Ann is disappointed but still has faith in him. Days go by and still Ann believes Henry is coming back for her. She waits for him anxiously everyday. Then two weeks pass and a letter is delivered to her stating that Henry has filed for divorce. There's no explanation. All she knows is Henry never loved her and never wanted to be married to her. The book picks up again two years into the future. Henry has spent the time saving his beloved Sea scape. He decided to go into town for the season and meets a beautiful woman at a ball that he falls in love with at first sight. He can't think. He can't walk. He can't talk. He just stands there never taking his eyes off of her. He asks her to dance and she says yes. During the dance itself Henry asks her questions about herself. She doesn't answer anything clearly. She merely hints that they'd met before. Henry of course makes the mistake of claiming if he'd seen her before he'd not forget. She's too beautiful for anyone to forget her. He manages to guide her onto a terrace where he proceeds to kiss her. For some reason this upsets her and she runs off without a word. Dazed because the kiss effected him so strongly, Henry doesn't go after her. A friend of his joins him on the terrace and Henry immediately asks about the woman. He declares he has to know everything there is to know about her. He's going to make her his no matter what. His friend begins to laugh so hard he can't get a word out. When he does manage to speak he informs Henry he just shared a dance and kiss with his ex wife. Yes, Ann is now beautiful. She starved herself after Henry abandoned and humiliated her, too upset to eat. She lost weight. She's a whole new person. Henry has no idea the kind of mess he left for Ann. Being rejected as she was the <i>ton</i> no longer accepted her. She was a laughing stock. Everyone talked about her. Her own parents threw her out of her home and refused to see her ever again. Ann has changed in other ways besides physically. She's no longer the innocent trusting young girl she was before when she fell in love with Henry. She's cynical and very, very angry. All she wants to do is get revenge on her ex husband. She plans to seduce him. Make him want her. Make him love her and then publicly reject him. And all Henry wants to do is prove he truly loves her. That he's sorry. That he didn't know her before when he married her and that if he had he would have loved her then no matter what her appearance was. Is there a happy ending? Of course.<br /><br />I want it for me. I want to fall in love with some gorgeous guy who completely uses me. I want him to pretend to love me in front of tons of people. People who have always made fun of me. People who never thought I was good enough. People who never accepted me. I want to be rejected in front of them all. Then I want to become beautiful. I want the man who broke my heart to fall in love with me. To regret what he did to me. To come crawling on his knees begging me to give him a chance. I want him to make his main goal in life to be proving he loves me now not because of the way I look but because he finally gets to know me. The me I am on the inside. I want to make him realize that beauty is in the soul and it's not always visible. That's my idea of the perfect fairytale."

"event","I love when something good will happen just out of the blue. Something small. I've never done an official count, but I'm pretty sure I've read at least a thousand historical romance novels over the years. I started with really old books. My mother had four egg boxes filled with books in her closet. Out of boredom I picked one up one day. I believe the first one I read was ""Shanna"" by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss. That was actually just an attempt. I say attempt because I believe I was seven. If you've ever read anything by her you'll understand that for such a young girl it wasn't very easy to comprehend what I was reading. I didn't give up though. I think by ten I was finally able to understand just what I was reading. I fell in love. I've always been obsessed with history. Throw romance into the mix and you've got me hooked. When I was a teenager I started to check out books from the library about every two weeks. I'd check out fifty or more at a time and finish them within a month. Sometimes less. When I started getting my SSI checks I began making monthly trips to goodwill to build up my own collection. I buy at least sixty or more books at a time. And every once in a while when I'm dumb enough to chance Barnes and Noble I'll go crazy and spend hundreds of dollars on brand new books by favorite authors that I just can't resist buying. So basically over the years I've read a lot of historical romance novels. As you can imagine it gets somewhat confusing. I sometimes can't recall which books I liked, which I hated and what each one was about. But there have been several that I really fell in love with. A lot of them were books I'd checked out from the library and I can't remember their titles or who the authors were. It drives me crazy. The first week of this month I went to goodwill and purchased more books for my insanely large collection. I've read forty two out of the sixty that I bought. Then last night I discovered while reading one of them that it was actually one I'd checked out from the library as a teenager. One I'd been searching for. It's ""The Wastrel."" lol lovely, cheesy title, no? It also happens to be a harlequin romance which honestly are not the best. This one however is one of the few exceptions. The female lead lives with an eccentric Aunt and Uncle who she loves dearly but who also drive her crazy. Her Aunt wears clothing that is not at all in style. She also is very fond of turbans with crazy jewels. And she's an artist who feels the need to ask every single person she comes across if she can paint their portrait. Not something the <i>ton</i> appreciates. And of course there's the wastrel himself. A recluse. Dangerous, cocky, in love with himself. A womanizer who secretly was once heart broken over a woman who scorned him. Naturally his image to the <i>ton</i> is all fake. A total defense mechanism. The lead female also happens to be anything but perfect. She's not beautiful and horror of horrors she's not at all rich. Of course she immediately dislikes the wastrel. But her Aunt throws them together by painting his portrait. She insists she needs her niece to pose with him to get the painting ""just right."" And the painting itself is supposed to be of Eros and Psyche. I simply love it. It's funny and the story itself is unique. I'm ecstatic I found it again. If only I could find the others."

"event","I made this journal a long time ago and never got around to posting in it. I don't know why really. Too busy I guess. It's insane that I'm even able to say that. Generally I complain about having no life. Yet actually I guess I do have one. An online one at least.

I've added some people who were friends at my old journal. People I haven't spoken to in a really long time. If it bothers you I can always de-add you. lol is that even a work? I don't think so. 

My life has been changing a lot lately and truth be told it's been somewhat scary. I'm always fantasizing about change. About the things I want and how I'll react when I get them. But it's nothing like what I imagined it would be. After many years of endless searching I finally found the parts of me that have been missing. My siblings. I have two older brothers, two younger sisters and another younger brother. My second oldest brother was put up for adoption and sadly no one has been able to find him yet. My other older brother actually lives in Michigan. He's lived there all his life. He's been an hour away from me all these years. I even went to a concert with a friend at the college he goes to. He and I have been talking several times a day on myspace. Already we've formed a bond. I feel so close to him and he feels the same way. He's coming to see me on June 2nd. In fourteen days I'm finally going to meet my brother. I am so excited I don't even know what to do with myself. Unfortunately my younger siblings all live in Minnesota. I don't know when I'll be able to see them. I've talked to both my sisters. I love them already as well. My sister Danielle has a little baby boy named Adam. So not only am I a younger sister to someone, I also am an Aunt. It's just so much to take in but I'm loving it all. I also have to say that I love, love, LOVE having older siblings. I don't know why but I just love that I'm not the oldest anymore. 

I have more to say but I'll save it for later. I'm off to read and then I'm going to bed."

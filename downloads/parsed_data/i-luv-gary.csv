"event","<p><font color=""#00ccff"" size=""3"">man, how things have changed. i read all of my entries and how i thought things were big deals back then, and i look at it now, and it was really nothing. that makes me giggle.<br /><br />right now i am chillin, i have work tomorrow at 830, but i really dont wanna go. i am kinda depressed. i did something really stupid and i'll tell you about it.<br /><br />well i was with this guy - kinda- over the school year. we were FWB, and i liked him and i figured since that was the only way i could be with him, i would be that. but doin that i started to like him a lot. and i fell for him. i cared about him a lot. but he just outta a relationship and he didnt want anything. i understood, but it seemed like everytime it would come time to be serious he'd make up something to not do it. for example, he left to florida and told me he liked me a lot and i said why didnt you try anything than, and he said bcz he knew he was going to FL, and i said but i thought you didnt want anything bcz you just got outta a relationship, and he said no that was 1st semester. and i said, that makes no sense how that has anything to do with anything bcz you said you didnt want anything, and then you did, but now you say you cant bcz you knew you were going to FL. i feel that he was just making up excuses so he didnt have to be with me. i think if you wanna be with me, than be with me, stop making stuff up just to make yourself look better. thats what my dad does and i hate it. i wanna meet someone whos not gonna pull stuff outta there ass.&nbsp;<br /><br />but i like him, he's a really great guy but this is why he doesnt wanna be with me at all anymore...<br /><br />over MDW i hooked up with another guy, and i told him thinking he would handle it well --i was wrong-- but i thought he could bcz HE ASKED WHAT HAPPENED....but anyways...so i told him and he got mad and didnt talk to me for 2 weeks about maybe 3. so i was going insane bcz i didnt talk to him...i found out he really liked me and i was like how was i supposed to know you didnt tell me about it. the only way i'd be able to tell is through our actions, but a lotta ppl just act and dont mean it, so how should i know? but apparently he liked me a lot and whatever so i blew that chance. and i really did like him, he was someone i could see myself with, braggin to everyone, and i was happy when i was with him. there's not many ppl who make&nbsp;me happy. i am a person who either likes you or doesnt. after one month if i am still with you, and the one obsessed over you than you dont have to question my feelings for you, but if its been a month and dump you, i never liked you. but its like i had good times with him...but then at the same time i feel like i am making the average times into great times just bcz i cant be with him and i am trying to make myself fall for him and change the way he feels. soooo...he moved to FL for school, right? well he is coming back now, and bcz of the whole thing i did, he doesnt wanna come back but he has to for family reasons, but whatever, i wanna start over, but he doesnt and that makes me mad bcz i wanna try something, maybe it will work. but i feel bcz i messed up he is trying to make up reasons to get rid of me so he can go get with some hott girl and show her off or something...but whateverrr....i dunno. i just wanna be happy and i feel that if i am with someone i care about i can make them happy while me being with them makes me happy. when i am with someone i care about, i do anything in my power to make them happy. i do the cute lil couples things. like buying cute little things and surprizes and gifts and stuff. but i havent had that in a while. so i dunno.&nbsp;<br /><br />i wanna make things work with him, but i feel like he wants nothing to do with me, and bcz he's pushing me away, me the dumb girl wants him more. its stupid. but i wanna make things work and i wanna show him i can do this. you know?<br /><br />but anyways...Ian has a new gf and im upset about that...he's my first love you know? you'll always remember your first love, but i just cant get over the fact that me and him never worked out or tried to be worked out. i wanna try bcz i feel like someone will work. i can see me marrying him, but now he's with another girl, i cant do anything about it. but its okay, i am not gonna wait for him, bcz he's not waiting for me. so&nbsp;i am moving on, but of course keeping him in my heart, bcz he was my best friend and my first love, so he is special to me, and always will be. =)<br /><br />so now, ray fumero, my ex-fling from last summer, is tryin to start things up again with me. its like, i gave you friggen 3 chances already, you couldn't make it work any of the 3?! its like i messed up the first time, i gave you a 2nd chance you messed up and the 3rd time you messed up again....it shouldnt take a person 4 times to realize they ""really like someone and wants to make it work"" they should know from the beginning and act like it FROM THE BEGINNING! you know? but whatever....he wants to talk and explain, and i say fine, you can come to my house and talk to me, and he never follows through, so why the F do i want someone who i cant rely on? WHY? it makes no sence, if i cant rely on you to come to my house just for you to explain what you did wrong to try to win me back, then how do you think i am going to rely on you for anything else? you're crazy.&nbsp; if winning me back is so important to you than you should be at my house right when you say you're gonna be there and you should try everything in your way to talk to me and not ""fall asleep"" 2 mins later after talkin to me...i guess its not that friggen important than....thats why i said...""stop wasting your time and mine on something that is obviously not important to you. just let it be"" but he wont stop...but he not doin anything anyways....but whatever.rrrrrrrrr....<br /><br />so yea...im bummed...i want Fernando, and i want Ian, but i cant have either. life stinks. i will justt stay single.&nbsp;<br /><br />after my mistake with Fernando, i will wait for him. because i'd really like to see something florish with him. =]<br /><br />as for now, im going to work out and then shower and then knock out bcz i have to be at work at 830 and wake up 730.&nbsp;<br /><br />Goodnight. &lt;3</font></p>"

"event","i dont get it. right when i think everything is going to work out either something does happen against my behalf or i just think something bad has happened. i dont know which one it is. until i do find out im going to be a nervous wreck. i dunno how i should think because for the past two weeks he was acting one way and then tonight i dont know if it was just a bad night or something but he was just acting weird. so i dont know how to take it. mayb it was just a tonight thing. i hope. im also tryin to figure out whats going down here. no one can figure it out. everyone helps me out, supports me, and gives me advice but when it comes time to doing this advice, i dont have the balls to do it. its good advice but i dont wanna rush ne thing, make myself look like an ass so i can never talk to him again, or just do ne thing wrong generally. my school work is lagging. im trying to stay up in my studies but there is so much going through my mind. i thought this would be simple just having him there to chill with, but not being with him completly makes it worse bcz then i think about that all the time. i think that if we were together it would b easier bcz i wouldnt have to worry about what he wants what hes thinking etc. there would b bumps, but im willing to work them out. the crazy thing is, is that im waiting for him, and i never wait for ne one. i get what i want and then i leave, but im waiting for him. i feel like there is something there but i dont want to miss judge this and then have nothing out of it. ""..but my heart keeps falling faster.."" is a good quote right now. i just want to know what hes thinking. what he wants. etc. and if hes just toying with me then it will be over but if he wants something then ill be here. i want something to work out. *lauren committing, crazy thought* but i dunno. i dont want to push it but at the same time i dont want to hold it too loose and let it get away. tough calls are going to be going on right about now, and the next few decisions will be desiding the outcome of the future.

-until next time. im dead tired and im goind to sleep. gimme some advice if u think u can help. id love it. good night. <3"

saturday i went to marinas house and then got my pictures. they all turned out good. they were all pretty! and then i chilled with michael at my house. we put my pictures on my walls and then went to friendlys. we met up with harold and then walked around clark all night. it was an okay night, but it felt never ending.

"event","yesterday i went to garwood and saw ian and marina for a couple minutes. i havent seen ian in 3 weeks and marina in a week. i miss everyone in garwood! i wanted to see mai so bad but she was in NYC with her daddy. i havent seen her since june, when i get back, we're having a sleep over.

After garwood i went to elizabeth to visit my grandmothers friend Jesus. He's a lot older now, but thank god he is doing well. lilly and gracie came there and met up with us. we chilled there for a bit and then it was time to cisit other friends.

We left elizabeth and went to union city. it was a fun drive bcz i got to ride with lily and grace. there were so many spanish people in union city. i liked it bcz it was so different from garwood and my dads house. more excting. lol. ian called me and told me i was right by north bergan. i was like 'really?' i was gonna go visit neil but he didnt pick up his fone. so we just ended up chilling at minga and pepe's house. it was alright i guess. 

When we left their house we drove around and looked for a resturant to eat at. us girls were followed by 3 different guys in the short time that we were looking for a place. i was like whhaaat? i didnt think ne one actually did that. well silly me. they do. wen we found the place it was a cuban cuisine restuarant. it was really nice there.

at the table next to me there was this guy with the most gorgeous blue eyes ever. he was cuban and cute. two great combos. lol. we kept lookin at eachother. *eye contact* the most important thing about getting a girl/guy.i couldnt help myself but look. lol. and then right wen he left, he looked back at me and gave me a big smile. =] lol. 

We left the restuarant and just drove home. i slept the whole ride home. 

right now im talkin to mai. shes too funny. lol. ronnie. we're planning a sleepover for wen i come home. i cant wait. its gonna b the best reunion ever. lol. chis. corn rows. lol. africans with babies. lol.

today i was supposed to wake up at 930 bcz the of the cleaning ladies and then to take my sister to gymboree but lisa was a sweetheart and let me sleep til 3. how nice of her. i had a talk with her and she is such a pleasent woman. and i knew she wasnt happy with daddys golf. we were gonna out to the mall bcz daddy was out all day but my grandma wasnt feeling well so we just stayed home. lisa cooked dinner while alaina was sleeping and me and alyssa were in the backyard on the swings. we ate and then alyssa started hysterically crying bcz she thought she saw a snake. so lisa went right upstairs. so for her i cleaned up everything so she wouldnt have a mess. i hope she likes it! lol

you're wack. how can u try to tell me i did something that i didnt do? u just go and assume that i did it. you should really do research before you attack a person with incorrect information. you just make yourself look like an ASS. i guess now u can 'have a reason' to not like me for real. dork.

tomorrow im going to take professional pictures with alaina and alyssa. it should b fun. i hope everything goes well and the pictures dont come out bad. lol. well, until next time <3"

"event","on friday i went to go pick up marina. the drive was long. 2 hours there 2 hours back. but it was fun. marina and i we're trying to immatate really bad singers and making fun of ppl while singing mariah carrey. it was fun. my dad got a kick outta it. and we kept him awake. when she got here i gave her a tore of the house and we ate some pizza. it was yummie. we watched dirty dancing havana nights too. she loved it. first words outta her mouth wen the movie was over ""lets watch it again"" lol. its a great movie. that was time # 9. then we got ready for bed and talked and chilled and stuff. lol. 

Saturday we woke up and had cereal and chilled for a bit. we called my friend steve and asked him if he wanted to come with us to the mall and he was like suree. and so we were there. it took forever for us to get ready. lol. wen we got to the mall we walked into every shoe store. this guy damon went up to me and sed 'i really like your shoes. they r really nice. and if u need any help u can ask me' i was like hehe cool. lol. and so we were walkin around the store and this other guy started hitting on marina so i walked away lol. the guy damon was cute. he got my number. lol. and then we walked around the mall dragging steve everywhere. me and marina tried on a bunch of dresses and it was sooo fun! steve was helping us pic out the dresses. lol it was funny. we were talking pictures of our favorite outfits. lol. funny stuff. i bought a brooklyn dress and twinkie underwears. they r soo cute. lol. after the mall we dropped off steve and then we went to the movies. we saw the note book. it was a good movie but the people around us were soo rude, having their cellfones ring, talking, laughing, everything. it was annoying. it ruined the movie for me a bit. but i got over it.

sunday we woke up late and made ourselves a huge breakfast! it was great. she experianced REAL coffee. she sed it was too strong but its just the amazing cuban coffee. its good stuff. she had cafe con leche instead of just cafe. after breakfast we called steve to see if he wanted to chill for a lil. he came over and we ate pop rocks went on the computer and cleaned the chair my sister wrote on. lol. oops. it came out tho. thank god. and then key called me and wanted to see marina. he came over for a bit and then daddy was like 'we gotta go' so then they all left. and it was about a 2 and a half hour drive there and then it was 3 n a half hour drive back. there was soo much traffic. it was insane. but it was so fun with marina here. i havent seen her in so long so i guess thats what made it even more fun. when i come back from florida she might b staying here for a week! that should b fun as hell. and we can just chill all the time. it would b great.

now ima go chill for a bit..<3"

"event","i started dancing last night. my dad is teaching me how to salsa. its fun so far and im ready to learn the next step. 

im getting into more spanish music. its actually very intersting stuff. the way all the instruments go together so well. lol. good stuff. 

today im doing nothing again. it is such an ugly day out. it was pouring before. but now it is just ugly, cloudy, and dark. so ill b dancing all night again. steve is in trouble for sleeping late today, so i cant chill with him. ill learn some more dancing i guess. 

its still getting higher, but ive watched dirty dancing havana nights 6 times now. to me, its that good. but to others it may not affect them like it is me. but um, its good stuff. im definetly buying the movie and the cound track. they have good songs on it. so its worth it. i have a lot of people to teach now that im learning. =]

wen i go back to north jersy im going to enroll myself in salsa classes. that should be fun.

the days are counting down until marina comes here. im pretty excited. on sunday wen we go back to drop her home we're going to b visiting all my grandmothers friends. and then we're going to b going to dan chavez's house to visit his family. cuban families are like that. lol. that should b interesting. i talk to his grandma and he talks to mine. we're like family now. lol. i cant wait but i have a feeling its going to get very awkward. hopefully not.

dinner time at the lopez residence..<33

"event","<P>last week i came to my dads house to visit and watch my grandmother for a month. my grandmother speaks not a single word of english. lucky me. i know a lot of spanish but i can understand a lot more than i can speak. so its difficult sometimes. there really isnt anything to do here. i just made some friends a few days ago and they r pretty kool. they're not really close to my age tho. they r either younger or older than me. i have lots of fun just chillin with them, and when im not chillin with them im home with my abuela, on the computer, watching tv, or sleeping. </P>
<P>last night i was chillin with one of my guy friends from down here and he was puttin a hard game on me. he's one of those guys that when he wants something he'll get it and he is trying to get with me. im trying hard to resist but the stuff he does is so cute, yet phoney. you know how it is.</P>
<P>&nbsp;i recently saw the movie Dirty Dancing Havana Nights and that got me interested in gettin into my cuban backround. i also want to visit cuba wen i get old enough. my dad sed he'll take me when communism goes away and who knows when that will be. but i think ill have a great time there. hopefully ill meet a nice cuban man that knows how to have fun and how to treat a lady. thats what im looking for right now. lol. but um, that movie got me thinking. i saw it twice and i re-rented it bcz im gonna watch it even more. *dork* i kno ima dork. u can say it. but yea. if u havent seen it, you must. there is SEXXE dancing and a cute love story.</P>
<P>&nbsp;marina is going to be visiting me for a weekend here. she's comming this friday. this should b fun. we're gonna b chillin with my new friends and just going to the mall and the movies so its gonna b cool. just chillin like the good ol' days. so i cant wait for that. when i go back home im going to b with my babie ian. he's my best friend. we're gonna go to his old town and chill with his boys there. that should b really fun. so im excited. lol. im really chill with one of his cuban friends and we've been talking a lot lately so im really excited to see him. but it will b all good. we'll b chillin for a while n it will b great. over the past couple days ive been having headaches like crazy. tylenol isnt helping me at all. im dying over here. i dont kno y im getting them though. i used to wear glasses but i dont ne more. that could b y. i spend my entire day on the computer. that could also be y. i strain my eyes a lot to see things. that could also b y. but i dunno. im gettin an eye exam when i get back from here. and hopefully while im here i should b getting my permit. so im very excited. =] </P>
<P>after marina leaves im getting a professional picture taken with both of my sisters so i cant wait for that. it should b so cute. and then i will b able to show everyone the picture and they can b like ""aww u guys look so alike"" lol. and etc. but it will b my first professional picture in a while.i want to do a lot here but i have so many restrictions. </P>

"event","just watched dirty dancing havana nights. it was a cute movie. lots of love. there were certain parts where it made me smile and a tear rolled down my face. then there were 'oh no' parts with a tear of sadness. lol. it was a good movie if u like romance and dancing. very inspirational to beginner dancers. now i really wanna take salsa lessons. it also made me wanna fall in love with a romantic hispanic man! lol. ima dork. i know.

'Afro-Cuban dance,its the dance of slaves.when they dance it was their only time to feel free. It's a dance about exactly who you want to be in that moment. It has to feel and look as natural as the waves. Coming and going.'

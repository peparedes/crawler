The location detecter says that I'm in London. I am not in London. I am in the North West I'll have you know ;)"

So, you may beleive that it's made up, or either one of them don't exiswt, but you must have some idea even if (in your opinion) it's just a story. I don't beleive in heaven, but i do have an image of it if i were to draw in on a peice of paper. It'd be situated in a bundle of soft, cut cirrus clouds, abandoned in the colour of the most beatiful blue sky. There'd be glorious golden gates sectioning it off from the rest of the sky. And there'd be people walking around, barefoot, in luxurious white togas. And everywhere you went, there'd be a peaceful choir of cherubs singing away in the background. There'd be not hate or anger, just love, tranquil and harmony. Ok, so it's not exactly my way of life, but it's what i'd prefer if i was ever to end up there. 
Hell, however, that's another story...

My fave was when i had an awesome day out with my friends, Danny, Alex, Cat, Josh and Emma. We had been walking home from Stanley park after a vicious and long-lasting game of manhunt, and it was after dark. We were all just walking arm in arm eating haribo and exchanging small-talk as we were all absolutley knackered. All of a sudden, Danny wizzed infront of us and took a shot. And there it remained, unexpected, and unprocessed"

"event","<p>i've seen all of these <strong>icon making comptitions</strong> everywhere and&nbsp; i don't know if i want to join them or not. Its not because i think i'm bad at making them or anything, its just that i'm new to LJ so, <strong>i'm a bit shy of talking to other users</strong>. Sounds stupid but next time i find a good competiton, i'm going to make them and post them on my own site, instead of competing for them on someone&nbsp;elses. Hope thats ok with everyone :)&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<em><u>How did you spend summers when you were a kid?</u></em><br /><br />Me, my brother and my dad used to go to the beach and spend the whole day there. We would walk up to the sand dunes, get a Notrianni ice cram and go to some quaint cafe in St.Annes. Then we would walk back along the beach, collecting shells and playing in the sea.&nbsp;<br />I sometimes went shopping with my friends and had girly sleepovers. You know, a chick flick and some nail varnish! The next day, we would go ice skating. One time, we were supposed to&nbsp;met at the cinema&nbsp;to watch Mr. Bean's holiday, and Laura didn't turn up. So me, Amy, Emma and Abby went on th promnade and got a horse and carriage ride. Then we went to Kingscote feild and messed about. Ahhhhhh... those were the days...&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Hi, i'm new to the whole livejournal thing. So i don't really know what i'm doing! I've seen some fab Jeff Hardy communities about and thats where i got inspiration to join. I'm still shocked over benoits death. I don't think that anyone should suddenly lose respect for him because of what he has done. He truly was a great wrestler and brought loads to the industry of WWE. *Eyes are filling up*. Anyway, I'm not realy miffed about the Hardys losing at Vengeance, because i&nbsp; heared that they want to focus on being single competitors. Hope&nbsp;jeff gets&nbsp;a belt though, like the intercontinental, again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

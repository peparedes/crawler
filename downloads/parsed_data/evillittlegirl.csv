"event","So going out to the west coast was awesome.

Thanks to Tim, I got to go to Laguna Beach, Hollywood, and Santa Monica.  I had the most amazing time, even while sitting in traffic on the 405. We rocked it so much harder than we are awesome.

He also brought me to see one of my most favorite people ever who I miss like, OMG.  I got to see my DEMI!!!  Hanging out with her was just like old times, especially given the suggestive statue in the ladies room.

Training wasn't bad at all.  It was actually really informative and entertaining.

And afterwards, after one of my supervisors blew the toll, we went to In and Out! (since me and Tim just ran out of time...we were full and I was exhausted).

I'll post my camera phone pictures in a bit.

Fall Out Boy tonight!


This is everything I needed to start feeling like me again.

PS Tim is my official run away husband now.

"event","<P>After spending a week caring for Adrina and taking care of school work, I have a new admiration for Mary.&nbsp; Never could a fathom at such a young age one person could take on a work load fit to bring a a 40 year old man to tears, keep up with an energetic four year old (who needs special attention for when the asthma kicks up), make time for friends and family, looking into going back to school, taking the first steps to owning her own house,&nbsp;and still be the wonderful person that she is.</P>
<P>Mary, I have never doubted or question you.&nbsp; You are an amazing person, a strong person, and a beautiful person.</P>
<P>Thank you for being the best influence in my life.</P>"

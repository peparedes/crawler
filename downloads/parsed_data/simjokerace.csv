"event","Two days until The Grudge.

So today was a rtagrga day. Full of sexual references and the return of my sexual frustration. But because of promises, I'm going to be a good boy, no matter how many man-to-hand meetings I'm going to do at night. Blerh-ahhh.

Tongue piercing soon, maybe within the next week. Depends on my sister. And yes, I'm getting the tongue ring for the most obvious reason. 

Tomorrow will be another day, one Latin test and a heavy work day in Photography. I need to improve my grades, so I'll be going home early tomorrow to hit the books that have never left my locker.

Urr, Dan, Margo, and myself hung out at McDonald's all day. Biscuit Lips was there and she was cracking me up. Lots of stories and jokes, it improved my day a good deal. Oh yeah, we started talking about Bryson today. The girl I had a crush on until last year. She reminds me of a fairy, except big. The pixie hair cut just works for her. Anyway, everyone in Photography agreed she was a do'able fairy, including Ashley. 

Well, bed now to contemplate my day and lose three hours of sleep on Tales of Symphonia. Gimme a hug tomorrow, pleaseeee."

"event","So, I haven't updated in awhile because too much has been going on. So this'll be a short update to a bunch of updates, I guess. Or not since the only people who read this have probably been there when everything has been going on. Anyway..

I've been surviving off the same left-overs for about four days. Thank God mama makes a shitload when she cooks. I have about a five gallons of mac'n'cheese and a few dozen wings. So.. I saw some porn shoot in the park today. Really it was Brannon Boyle doing some politically incorrect He-Ba-Ba(Iraqi) video. I dunno, it was pretty funny though. Then we beat up Evan on camera and gave him a suspending wedgie. Yeah..

Austin's house for some quick trash-talking video game action, now home to reflect on my day as I eat left-overs. Boner is sitting beside me, giving me puppy dog eyes, which is cheering me up a bit since he'll always be a dumb, adorable puppy. Yeah, he's my best friend. A 16 pound Jack Russel Terrier named after a hard-on. Oh well, I feel like playing cards , so.. 'Night.

Out."

"event","The Lesson of the Moth:

i was talking to a moth
the other evening
he was trying to break into
an electric light bulb
and fry himself on the wires

why do you fellows
pull this stunt I asked him
because it is the conventional
thing for moths or why
if that had been an uncovered
candle instead of an electric
light bulb you would
now be a small unsightly cinder
have you no sense

plenty of it he answered
but at times we get tired
of using it
we get bored with the routine
and crave beauty
and excitement
fire is beautiful
and we know that if we get
too close it will kill us
but what does it matter
it is better to be happy
for a moment

and be burned up with beauty
than to live a long time
and be bored all the while
so we wad all our life up
into one little roll
and then we shoot the roll
that is what life is for
it is better to be a part of beauty
for one instant and then cease to
exist than to exist forever
and never be part of beauty
our attitude toward life
is come easy go easy
we are like human beings
used to be before they became
too civilized to enjoy themselves

and before i could argue him
out of his philosophy
he went and immolated himself
on a patent cigar lighter
i do not agree with him
myself i would rather have
half the happiness and twice
the longevity

but at the same time i wish
there was something i wanted
as badly as he wanted to fry himself


The cockroach's name is Archy and he is a character created by Don Marquis. Archy was a poet in a previous life. I don't remember all we learned about Archy except that nothing is capitalized because a cockroach can't hold Shift and press a key and it would take too long to use Cap Locks."

"event","Nothing exciting today.

Went to Lenox and drove RC cars around the mall. Trying to quit smoking, not working. Went back to Austin's and played games. Got a button for Margo.

Uhh, tommorrow Muz and myself go to the Love Shack with Kristen and her girlfriend to buy them a strap-on. Should be plenty of laughs.

Oh yeah, I punched Ben Thomas in the nose for turning my stereo up too loud. He had a big blue line across it on Monday. I didn't see him today. DON'T FUCK WITH MY STEREO, especially when I'm already pissed at the Dunwoody kids trying to rape Chamblee sophmores.

Oh yeah, parties suspended until further notice. Some kid(s) owe me a good $300, and no parties until I'm listening to a new $300 stereo system.


No more. Out."

"event","Today I ripped ass in a coffee can and a chick named Bryson saw my ass. 

Muztird opened the coffee can and stumbled back. I knew he wasn't faking because no one told him that it smelled like utter shit. 

Went to Best Buy and bought cds, oooh.

I'm going to a Europe conference for the trip next summer.

Sleep later.

"event","So today was the first Friday since school had begun. In truth, school hasn't been too troublesome.. Except my Computer Graphics teacher tricked me and I got a zero on a homework grade. Conversation:

Me: ""Do we have any homework?""
Teacher: ""Yes, do the Pretest at home and bring back tomorrow.""
Me: ""I thought you told us to read chapater 2 so we could skip it next week?""
Teacher: ""Oh yeah, do that.""
Me: ""So Pretest and read Chapter 2?""
Teacher: ""Read Chapter 2.""

So then she collects it. After that, she tells me she repeated Chapter 2 to necause that's all she heard me say. rubbigragrbife. The rest of the day went smoothly. Then I came home. And that's where I stayed ALL NIGHT. Dan forgot to call back about the hotel party and in truth, I was too exhausted to go. I slept from 4 until 7, then 8 until 10. 

So around midnight, I find this huge black marker and start coloring my face and doodling designs and stuff. It looked pretty good despite my lack of any artistical abilities, so around 2:15 AM I took pictures before taking a bath. The marker had time to seep into my pores, so it felt good to wash it out. Mm, tomorrow is another day without any supervision. My sister moved out and my parents are in the mountains. Maybe a party tomorrow. It's hard to throw parties here because my neighbors are pretty old and still use the term ""hooligan"" as a serious insult. I'll try anyway. Shouldn't be too loud. Okay, well.. That's all.

Out."

"event","So yesterday was my last day of work. I walked away with around $1,500 for five weeks of work. I'm taking the rest of the summer, five days, off to relax and do what I should of been doing for five weeks. I'm pretty tired though. Work was definately a strain. I need to get money some other way.


Mm, I'm kind of ready for school to start. Atleast I did shit when I had the chance then. 


99X is doing that Naughty Night thing this Friday. Girls where there underwear, guys wear robes. Some club, it's suppose to be like the Playboy Mansion. They're doing high school games all night. Spin the bottle, Truth or Dare, some other shit. It should be too hard to get in. 


Haircut tomorrow. Going downtown to get clothes for school on Thursday.

No more to say.

Out."

"event","I've been working a lot, so my old journal fell into disarray. So Nyst asked me to make one, and here it is. Truthfully, I haven't done much today. I worked from 7:30-4 as a Pool Boy. Usually exciting stuff happens on that job. Two bumblebees had sex in my hair. That was the highlight of the day. Tomorrow promises excitement, as I will mostlikely work with Edgar or Ricardo! Until then, I got nothing to say. Bye."

"event","well ... its safe to say that i never ever update this thing anymore. i guess its just too much for me.. yeah i know lazy fuck. wuhtever.. i guess during the school year this will just be a kind of update every now and then whereas in the summer i update like ... twice a day. You nosy kids will just have to learn to deal without my private life. Okay, so today was thanksgiving. And let me just tell you, it sucked. It's not even like anything major happened to upset me. The holidays in general just depress me i guess. i hate it. i fight with liek everyone and i get wicked pissed off and i usually end up crying for some stupid reason. blahhh... so i slept at minori's last night and we woke uup early and went to the thanksgiving game, the last game at manning bowl. And yes we won fortunately. but then after Meggan dropped me off my mom told me we werent going to my grandmas till like 2:30. So i was really hungry and impatient. Fell asleep for like 2 hours, and woke up in a really grumpy mood. Didn't eat till like 5.. sat around... i duno i just can't really explain why i felt so upset today. I hate holidays because i have to make like a million trips to everywhere. and if i dont visit one parent.. thats it im the guiltiest worst kid in the world. and then i hear shit from both of them. just wonderful. The best thing that happened to me today was my grandma telling me her and my grandpa were guna take me shopping for my xmas present tomorrow. which thank god is going to be a brand new car. So that made me a little happier. They are guna make the payments till i graduate... but hopefully i will get a good job soon and i can help them out.. and feel a little better about getting the car. so yeah.. i can pick any car i want at a reasonable price. after that tomorrow i get to spend the whole day cleaning and packing up the rest of my room/house. then i will probably have to go with my mom or chris to the new house and bring boxes up. I HATE MOVING. seriously... if she moves me one more time before i graduate.. i really wont go with her. its off to my grandma's for me. the amazing thing is how she complains about it to me now. like it was my suggestion to move and it was this big pain for her. yeah.. wuhtever, dumbness i tell ya. i need to schedule road lessons damnit and set up an appointment for my road test. its guna be snowing soon. wonderful. i dont even no why i make these dumb retarded melodramatic updates. pay no attention to me.. it is rambling and venting. so go ahead roll your eyes and yell drama queen... cuz i cant hear you <3"

"event","i never update as much a i used too. im too busy all the time. and plus very lazy. Jessica is gone to South Carolina till monday, so i am lost without her. i told her to buy me a keychain :). tomorrow is friday. this week went by reasonably fast. i had a few tests that i did alrite on.. except for algebra. Mr. Rosen needs to just leave, because i hate him. i have a really bad grade in his class. but i cant help it if he was out for like 2 weeks. whatever i will fix it eventually. i went to the mall with my mom and chris tonight. i honestly don't get all of this, tonight was so normal. we just went to the mall cuz my mom had to find a dress for the policemans ball tomorrow. and we had fun. i just dont understand. Bad news has been coming in the bundle lately. My mom came in my room and told me that my aunt was in the hospital. i thought maybe she just hurt herself or sumthing but my mom told me it was for depression. that kinda blew me away.. depression.. she always seems so happy to mee, and she has a little girl and it just upset me. i asked why but my mother wouldnt explain. so i am assuming it is sumthing i wouldnt want to hear about. so i think i will keep it that way. sometimes i am better off not knowing. get better soon aunty. 

tomorrow is my grandma's birthday. and i think i am going with nicole and minori to get meggan a birthday present. saturday i am doing an escorting thing in nahant. i think i am meeting john kerry? lol that should be interesting. and i think the assisstant commandant of the marine corps. word. sat. night out to dinner for meg and robos bdays. good times ahead hopefully. well i got a million things to do tonight.so catch you later."

"event","sometimes making the best of things is the most important thing you can do in some situations. and honestly i'm trying. but i don't see how any of this is possibly going to work. 

I came home from dad's early today to do some cleaning and chris was home. we really havn't brought up the subject at all. and he just acted like it was nothing. he asked me if i was upset about it and i said yeah alot. but it wasn't going to do anything so what was the point. and i had to make up some dumb excuse to go in the other room so i didn't start to cry in front of him. why does it upset me so much.. its driving me insane. he isn't just another one of her boyfriends. he has been there for me, and he told me he still wants to be there for me, and that just made me feel ten times worse. i know nothing i say will make things different, so whenever my mom tries to ""talk"" to me about how i feel i just put up a happy front like moving is going to be this great big new start for us. but i hate it. but she's so happy about it. this all makes me sick.

school is horrible. i want nothing to do with any drama of any sort. i have my own priorities that i need to straighten out. sorry. i think everything is just ridiculous right now. i'm only sixteen and a lot older than some people, and these people have so many crazy problems that i could never even imagine having to deal with. it really scares me sumtimes. just live life at a normal pace people, stop rushing to grow up. yeah im a hypocrite i know, i always complain about being in high school and wanting to go to college. but honestly, theres a difference between wishing something would hurry up and happen, and actually rushing yourself and regretting it.

i took the PSAT's saturday. that was pure hell. i missed a few math ones. whatever i am over it. i hate timed tests.. i screw up because i know i only have limited time. oh well maybe i will do better on the next one.  

friday was jessica's birthday. Happy birthday jess i love you. your getting so old pretty soon u can take me off lay away ;)

tomorrow is roberts birthday. happy birthday robo, i made you such a pretty sign. you will love it, i promise.

|-all i can think of now is that something really good needs to happen to me soon, or i just give up. 

|-i also hate driving with a passion, and i dont know how i will ever pass my road test.
 
|-and to finish it off.. this week needs to go by as fast as possible, and i mean it."

"event","i know i havn't updated for a few days. which has become a record for me. But it has been extremely hectic and when im not busy i am probably crashing and getting sleep. the last few days have been exhausting. Friday night i went to the mall and the movies with jessica. we saw Ladder 49 and we bought some outfits. i'm awesome and i bought a shirt and a pair of pants for 9 dollars in total. then saturday i went to look at the apartment with my mom. my dad attempted to take me to the fair but it was so busy that we just gave up and drove home. later that day the gang all went up there so i joined them and we got in alrite. it was so crowded. it wasnt the greatest, but i did have fun. robert locked his car keys in the car at like 11:00 at night at johns roast beef. lol we were on our way to some dumb party and we were stuck. it was pretty funny. like 10 of us had to get in annie's van and drive to his house to get the spare key. so then sunday i had to wake up early to march in the Columbus Day parade in east boston. argh that was hell. it was so freakin long and i wanted to die.. my throat was killing so i couldnt even command right and we were just horrible. so after that krap was over i went to my dads and passed out for an hour then ran home and showered and got ready for the palace. as tired as i was i have to say that i had so much god damn fun. i don't care how tacky and cheesy that place is.. it is a good place to go to get ur mind off things. i just danced and had fun with my friends. and danced in a tub of bubbles.. yeah it was amazing. so that was good and then jess slept over and the next day i slept wicked late and layed around and then i went to my grandparents and just chilled. it was so good to go there and just relax. 

Sunday when i got home from the parade my mom was home. she was extremely perky and so i knew something was up. the lady had called her..and we got the apartment. So now i am moving, in like 30 days. I have like 30 days to pack up all this shit and move. arghh.. its like the worst time in the world for this to start happening. i dont care im still going away in the beginning of november. i'll pack before that. i need that vacation desperately. i can't wait. pennsylvania here i come..  

tomorrow is uniform day and i dont want to wear it but i will deal. im so scared tomorrow is my first road lesson. i dont want to drive.. i hate it. so im just hoping to god that goes alrite. 

i am so tired.. i am always tired.. 

i love my bed.

"event","tomorrow is friday. fianlly. i need this long weekend. saturday at 10 im going to look at the apartment. i hope i hate it. not that it will make a difference. im all alone right now. big surprise. this house has been deserted for about a week. my mother makes up reasons just to stay out. okay i am done pitying myself now.

today i had drill and school. tomorrow i  have to pass in all my dog tags. i hate selling things its a pain in the ass but u gotta do it. i didnt sell as many as everyone else.i feel liek a bad class officer. i will do better the next time. 

i went to my grandpa's after school. he came and picked me up at school andi just went thee to hang out. it was really good, until he made me clean the basement with him. i got all dirty and it was dusty so i was sneezing like crazy. but i also enjoyed it because i got to spend time with just him and my puppiee and we found a bunch of stuff that use to be mine when i was a little girl. i miss being a kid. im just begginning to really see how differently you view the adults in your life when your younger. They are like your idols who do no wrong. now a days i really miss that. I need my idols back again.
 
i ordered my ring today. it wasnt what i expected but i didnt feel like re-doing the whole thing so oh well.. it happens. i like it enough to wear it. freakin 389 bucks. i havnt done any of my homework. hmm i will do it in school i guess. i wana take a shower tonite so i can sleep late tomorrow. so im guna go do that after im done here. i notice the more i write in this thing the more it upsets me. so lets think happy thoughts... 

okay so i talked to jess on the fone earlier this evening. which was a good time because i love talking to her on the fone especially when we have stuff to talk about. so we chatted for a while and i raised my cell fone bill cuz it wasnt free. oh well..haahaa mom take that. so yeah we were talking and i told her how my doggie was sick becuz he has a soar throat from barking too much and he had to go to the vets. and she thoughti said my dad.. lol it sounds dumb but u hadda be there.. we have the worst hearing in the world. i love it. so yeah her 17th bday is a week from tomorrow. shes growin up so quick! and then the next day is PSAT's..gahhh.. (puts gun to head) wuhtever i dont care. so lately i have been thinking that, maybe a nice guy would get my mind off of all this krap. but my problem is who.. lol as always, because there isnt anyone. i think about it alot too, so it isnt good cuz i start thinking about stupid stuff. eghh i dont even know what i am talking about. so im just guna stop. Point blank, if your a man, holler. HA..kidding. i don't think i need a guy to make me happy right now , or ever for that matter. i can do it myself. i just think it would be nice at the time being. that's all im saying. and im done."

Today i went to IHOP with robo after school and then went and got cassi and we went to special thoughts and bought glow sticks for sunday and then made a trip to vinnin square. i bought the coheed and cambria cd but i left it in roberts car. he is going to give me it tomorrow.i am really tired because i had to get up early two mornings in a row. tomorrow will be a late day though so i am excited. i need this week to be over and my weekend to come. i need a little enjoyment in my life. hopefully mall for heels on saturday and then topsfield fair that evening. then sunday parade in boston, dad's, and then the palace. i have glow sticks, i am happy. 

My mom and Chris are breaking up. I'm extremely upset. I don't know what me and my mom are guna do now. argh.. things better work out or sumthing i don't want him to leave me. and my mom wishes to move. this doesn't thrill me in the least. 

I have to schedule all my road lessons for this month. because i have to get my liscence as soon as possible. im eligible november 11th i just dont want to have to wait for the driving school certificate. im definately getting that car. chris is just working things out with the guy. my mom already gave chris the money for it. i showed robert wuht it looks like today when one like it drove by and he sed he thought it looked liek a nice little sports car, so that made me happy. i just want toget all this krap done and over with. im started to get drowsy so im guna forget the homework and go to bed."

went to dad's today. I spent most of the day upstairs with my grandma. I didn't get to see her last weekend so i missed her alot. we talked for a while and did the usual reading the newspaper and having tea and stuff. i did a puzzle, cuz i am a cornball. but i had a lot of fun just talking to her. Because she actually listens to me. and that makes me feel a whole lot better. my dad isn't feeling well lately. first it was chest pains and now he is having head pains? if that even makes sense. i duno but he needs to go to the doctors and get checked out. I gave him a box of Krispy Kreme donoughts, which probably wasn't a good idea. 

Right now i am trying to do like 10 things at once. I am doing laundry and folding laundry and updating this journal and doing my chemistry lab report. I thought a bunch of us were going to do it together, but apparently not so i am doing it on my own. I have to go downstairs and switch my laundry over. This is guna be a busy week. I have to get my check cashed and bring my shirt to the dry cleaners tomorrow. I also have drill in the morning and tuesday i have to go to the guys practice. so i am going to be really tired this week. 

Even though i didn't really do much this weekend, it was really good for some reason. I think i needed those 2 days of doing absolutely nothing. I feel kind of peaceful now."

so all of this made me in a horrible mood. whatever. just wait till i get out of that place.. 

i have to go buy cake mix.. and i don't want to do hw.. i think i might go do that. i am going to be a chef tomorrow and bake a cake for michelle's birthday, thats going to be a project if ever. anna gave me this shirt she didn't want any more, and its cool and striped and i  just fell in love with it. so when i got home i put it on. tomorrow i have to wear my uniform to school. definately not looking forward to it. debating on whether to bring a change of clothes or not. becuz i am only going home after school anyways. then tomorrow night is the parent meeting / first exhibition practice. i dont have to go but i want to help them out. and watch how they teach, just to check up on em'. but they will have control not me.. so im psyched.  i get to kick back and watch. plus im going in early to give michelle her cake.

Apparently the guy died and his son is trying to get rid of it for like, 200 bucks. it runs good and has a brand new stereo in it or sumthing. And it is a mitsubishi Eclipse, but don't get ur hopes up like I did... its really old. So  it doesn't really look nice at all. It doesn't even look like an eclipse the shape is all different. I wana say it is like a 90 or 91. yeah.. but wuhtever it is a car right? and its only 200 bucks. so i am pretty excited becuz if i get it i will start doing my road lessons and get my liscence by november. The fact that i might have a car motivates me more becuz i know that i can actually get places. and i will be able to get a job and i can drive to it. i don't care if its a shit box I'm guna get new tires for it and detail the inside. 

I'm not getting my hopes up yet becuz this might not happen, but i think chris is really serious about it this time.

We had nothing to do so we decided it would be a wonderful idea to go to richdales and buy soap. lol and sean being the bad ass he is chucked the soap into this fountain at this florist shop, and the suds started bubbling up. as stupid as it sounds, it was pretty freakin hilarious. so we drove around like four times waiting for the soap to build up. by the end of the night the bubbles reached the top of the fountain. lol classic.

In other news, i went to the Dermatologist today. Yes, she did the light therapy again. I hate it so much, but luckily this was my last time for the treatment. The fourth and final, so i am quite relieved. This time the lady was so nice and i am glad she did it becuz she tried to be extra careful and she actually talked to me. i wish she did it all the other times too. It is very red right now but i have a feeling this might help. Well it's not a feeling, it is more of a hope. I try everything and really nothing ever works. And the worst part of it is how they make everything seem like it will work, and then i end up getting my hopes up. Then the medication fails and i end up either looking the same or worse. Talk about bad self image. I don't know, i just really need this thing to work for me.. i can't take any more of this stuff. It's to the point of pain when i go there. Today in the office she had to rub acetone on my face and i started to cry. Yes acetone, it was horrible and the stinging pain was unbelievable. Then sitting under that light for 12 minutes was excruciating. It felt like they stuck me in a microwave. I just feel like if this time doesn't work, that i have just been exposing myself to all this pain and for nothing. Also i would feel like i threw all my mom's money out the window. She does so much to help and i feel bad cuz it doesn't work and i feel like im wasting her time/money. Damn you genetics. You probably have no clue wuht i am talking about, but that should give you the general idea about it. But enough of that .

Not going to school tomorrow becuz of extreme redness and sun sensitivity. So i get some quality time to myself tomorrow. All day. I'm looking forward to the sleep and the ""cleaning"". It's guna be great cuz chris went food shopping, so i can eat everything to my hearts desire. I can also get a chance to write my english paper. I need to do a really good job on it. I need to prove to Ms. Gardner that i should be in AP English. I hate the fact that i am in the honors english class that is mixed with AP English because she assigns us all the same work, and its SO hard. but i get it done and i do it good. But its unfair because they get a lot more credit than we do and so i went up to her and explained my situation. So maybe a congratulations will be in order for Lizz. I might be in AP. or mabe its a death sentence.. meh however you'd like to think of it. I see the glass as half full =). So saturday i have to get together with Krissi in the morning to Go over our Prosecution for the Mock Trial we are having in History with Bill. We have to make an opening and closing statement, and i am going to do the Cross examination. So since i am not going to be there tomorrow i have to do it over the weekend. Then that night is Scully's Birthday Extravaganza! It will be held at the Hepatitis Free Bertucci's on Route one. should be a good one. Then sunday it's off to go apple picking with my lovely Jessica. And i would like to add the fact that i will be wearing a hate for every second of this weekend, hiding my lobster like appearances. 

Okay so i have one minor complaint about school today. I'm the Junior. Your the Seniors, i shouldn't be the one teaching and correcting. That's your role. I am not even in that stupid class. The SOPHMORES are teaching them. What ever happened to leadership. Sorry it just bothers me. I just hope i don't start acting like that when i am a senior. and i dont really care if you read this."

okay so today i blew off work, cuz they can screw, but i had a legitimate reason. I had to go to the Dads house today. so i called marty around 10:30 and apoligized for not being able to come in and apparently they lost today so i will be working tomorrow. so either way im still getting paid. From what i have heard from Jess, today was rather interesting..some guy did a donought at ford st. and rocks were flying and smashed sum other cars window and ""dented"" another car. that other car just wanted the money. assholes. so anyway today my dad picked me up around 12 and we took a trip to Vinnin Square, and i cashed my check. bad idea... when i know i have money i get a little too excited and spend large amounts. so my dad had to go to the grocery store so i headed to Walden Books...and spent 30 dollars. It didn't start out that way, honest, i just went in to buy the Bean Trees for school, and then i saw all these sequels to the books i have been reading, so i bought 2 others, 1. On the Bright side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God & 2. The Lovely Bones. I heard the Lovely Bones was a really good book so i splurged a little. oh well i'll get more money somehow. The Bean Trees is actually a very good book. so it won't be too tourterous to read. hopefully i can get it done in a few days. i'm writing a lot in this entry becuz i do not want to study for spanish and re-do my algebra hw... hmmm i can always do the algebra during rotc or rotc aid tomorrow. ahaha.. so much for cleaning my room yesterday, i wasted the enitre day.. maybe i will do a load of laundry now and read some more of the Bean Trees..i got to take a shower before bed tonite becuz i have a wonderful morning of drill and a class officers meeting tomorrow.. im jumping for joy...so i havta go do all this."

procrastination, laundry, crying for no reason, being at school at 6:30 in the morning, never saying anything when i am angry, trying to stay on your good side, trying to get you to notice me, people who are corny, cheaters, eating when i have nothing else to do, over analyzing everything, freaking about college, thinking about what i should do with my life, how guys are so important to everyone...they shouldn't be, being in a fight with someone, being criticized, being wrong, being too afraid to love, being too afraid to say that i am in love, feeling different, not understanding everyone else, that i don't know as many people as i wish i did, that i can't get to know everyone i wish i could, how me and my friends don't talk like we use to, how you confuse me more and more each day, how i am so depended on, and spiders.

i love:
crying for no reason, laughing until i can't breathe, being nostalgic, seeing my family all together, getting away form everything, swedish fish, listening to depressing music to boost my spirits..lol, school (in general, i love the concept of seeing my friends all the time and writing in english), being able to scribble down a good poem, learning about history, talking for hours, that feeling in my stomach when your there, being noticed, my friends, sleeping all day, laying around and doing nothing, screaming at the top of my lungs, frogs, anything with polka dots on it, singing in the shower, winning, being right, achieving something i want really bad, being really cold and having to bundle up under a billion blankets to keep warm, snow days, holding a baby, riding on rollercoasters, meeting new friends, running down the beach when i get really stressed, watching old love movies that make me cry, , writing the greatest paper ever, reading an awesome book.

Friday- went to school, then had a dril meeting right after. after that i met minori outside and we went to my house for a few to get some food. then we went down to the meadows to watch jessiee's soccer game. after that headed back to my house and i made plans to go out with jackie jess and robo. so robo came and got mee and all of us went to john's roast beef to visit krissi. then we brought minori home and on the way to townline, robo's radiator starts to leak. so we go back to his house to let it cool down and fix it, and then we went out to metro bowl instead. it was still kinda dripping but we made it, and on the way home we get all the way to euclid ave, and smoke starts pouring into the car from the hood. so we all start freakin out and he pulls over and we jump out of the car and go into mino's. he tried callin AAA but no one ansered, so he just had to drive the car straight home. some guy in minos sed there was sumthing reallie wrong and it would prob cost like 400 bucks to fix so roberts like freakin out. and then he drove home and me jackie and jess got a ride from jackie's dad. i have never been in a car when it broke down before. it was kinda scary. 

i really need to do sumthing... i am wasting my day. maybe i will go shower and then go down to cvs and get an application. becuz i need a job and they are hiring i guess. but i also might be getting a job at toomeys. i hope i get the job there becuz i know it would be easy and not too many long hours. i just went on the cvs website to see if i could apply there but i dont think i can. oh well. maybe i should do some english homework. meh tomorrow. i also need to read that book for history...ughhhhhhh it never ends."

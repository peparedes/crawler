"event","1- Wicked was amazingggg. Fiyero was SEXY.. can we say LONG HAIR, TIGHT PANTS, GOOD VOICE, & not to mention an adorable dancing style.. what more could Kari want? 

2- Beauty and the Beast is sooo stressful. How do I talk like a dresser, anyone? ""Careful, darling"" .. = Wtf? 

3- Beauty and the Beast in New York Citayyy in 1 and a half days.. I am SUPER amped.. like whoa. I dont think the city is ready for hotties like us!

4- TRISTAN & ISOLDE. What to say, what to say.. how about manic depressing, self-mutilating, but yet wonderful and riveting, I couldn't stop watching but yet I felt like I needed to stop! I tried to cry but tears just wouldn't come.. what to say? How about Caitlin & I have the BEST TIMES EVER, every time. [and PS el Senor James Franco, please donate to me a few sperm so that I can create the SEXIEST SPITTING IMAGE BABY OF YOU ever..]

5- My boy status is sadly still in the negatives.. I'm trying to be positive about it or at least neutral, but how can you be happy when you're so lonely? I'm not lonely exactly, I mean i have my friends to keep me company, but I don't have anyone to love me.. and I feel really deprived in the boy area... I think I just need to not watch any more romantic movies for about eh, 10 years or so.

6- Just a question.. why isn't the male sex attracted to me? Do I come off as a raging rugmuncher or something?

BTW, I loved James Franco before you, ya hear?

[I forgot an update about Fanfest.. for those who care (which I'm positive it is ALL of you) Brian Roberts was within touching distance, oh yes... TOUCHING DISTANCE, but did I touch him, negative. I stared in awe and attempted to snap a picture of him just as the camera decides to FAIL AT LIFE. I've never been so dissappointed in my life about something that I should have been ecstatic about.]

PS- Why do I have mixed feelings about EVERYTHING?"

"event","So, RENT was absolutely amazing. There are no other words to describe it. Adam Pascal is utterly the most gorgeous man, and I would die for him to sing anything to me.. I am FREAKING speechless. Rosario Dawson has the best body I've ever seen, I wanted to steal it. And trade it with mine. I was so impressed with her, I didn't think she was going to be that spectacular, but she was. I advise everyone to go see it, and I now have a new Brian Roberts-esque crush!!

I am in Orioles baseball denial. I crave the Orioles. Watching every other team play just makes me more depressed; if Angelos doesn't renew his contract, Kari will not be a happy camper. 


Happy 15th birthday to Samantha Richelle! (tomorrow)


20 minutes 'til Laguna & Laguna chat with Lauren & Angie!


The fall shows went (semi-)well, I danced better Friday night than Saturday night. I had SO many things on my mind Saturday night that were just like, controlling my thoughts.. and the fact that I felt like I was going to curl over and die any second didn't help much either.


Well I hope you guys love an actual update from me! Its a rare occasion, I know. But maybe once my life stops being so stressful and starts becoming more fun I'll have more time for cute little updates like such. 


Oh and PS All County rocks my rump!"

Camp was fabuloso, I forgot how much I missed my dear friends. I love you all <3

The Orioles swept their last series, which gave me some sort of closure for the season. Thank you Orioles, for making me somewhat (hah) satisfied with your finish. Get well Brian, I'll be sure to keep everyone updated! (Cause I know you care, psh!)

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was hard to watch, especially for Roberts' teammates. Shortstop Miguel Tejada has grown close to Roberts and they were both starters in the All-Star Game in July. </P>
<P>""After I see Brian going go down like that, my game went down, I couldn't concentrate,"" he said. ""The only thing I could think about is what happened to Brian. <STRONG>He is the last guy I want to see going down like that. He worked hard to be the player he is. He never complains about anything</STRONG>."" </P>
<P>Tejada said he called home after the game and his 5-year-old daughter Alexa began crying when he told her the news about Roberts. </P>
<P>""She loves Brian Roberts so much,"" Tejada said. ""I really feel sorry for him. I hope everything is going good for him."" </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I do too. I love Brian Roberts SO much.. and when I go to fanfest (praying) I'm going to kiss it and make it all better for him (if he's there)... (again praying). </P>
<P>I haven't been updating or online or anything because my internet is being totally ga-hetto.. call me if you need me cause the whole internet thing just pisses me off lately.</P>

"event","Okay, so yesterday me and Cait left for B-more at like 1ish. We got there at like 2:30 and spent a half hour trying to find a parking garage in B-more that wasn't closed or shady.. and after being eye raped by at least 4 different mexicans, we made it to our parking garage. It was perfect, straight down 4 blocks from the stadium, right beside McDonald's, and 2 blocks from SUBWAY. That's where we went first. It was about 3 when we ate lunch (ridiculous I know.. lol) but it wasn't that bad for an inner-city Baltimore fast-food restaurant, it didn't smell anything like the McDonald's. It was VERY clean and the people were VERY nice. I was impressed. After we ate, we headed to the Gallery to waste some time and do some shopping (because the shops there are the best, like, ever). We went in Forever 21, payless (i <3 payless.. lol), Claire's (there was a 40-yr old gay guy working there who kept smelling cookies.. weird), Wet Seal (my new place of obsession), and lots of other places but all I bought were these orange beads from Claire's cause I needed some orange jewelry for the game. Then we went to Starbucks and saw a HOTTIE. and I'm talkign HOTTIE. so cait took a pic of him with her phone, so stalkerish I know.. but I'm telling you. HOT-TIE. So we headed back to the car to get changed.. after almost being stampeded by a guy with a big cart yelling at us to get out of the way, we're like HELLO its a freaking sidewalk, we're not going to get out of the way! So we got back to the car, changed, sat in the air for a few minutes, then headed to the ballpark. We got some stares as we walked the 4 blocks, but oh well. We got in, I bought my O's magazine, and we waited in line for 5 minutes to get into the park. We finally got in at 5:31 (1 minute late.. pshh!) and headed down to the front to get autographs. But none of the players came out to sign any, so we were S.O.L. But, Erik Bedard walked by and I was like.. ""Caitlin, yell he's a hottie!"" and she goes ""Bedard, you're a hottie!"" and he waved at her, lol.. it was fabulous, it made us really happy.. lol. Then we saw Elrod Hendricks, and I was like.. ""Caitlin, please don't yell he's a hottie!"" and she didn't, but we got a wave from him, and then Ray Miller. After that we kinda gave up and we saw this whole section of really great seats so we sat down there even though our seats were like sooo far away ..lol.. and we were the only people that snuck out of our seats that didn't get caught by the usher in that section aka. the seat & poster nazi. Here's where it gets good. B.J. Ryan saw our sign and waved and was laughing, lol (our sign said ""Future Oriole Wives"") and it was fabulous. Then Brian was stretching and we kept yelling his name and then finally he heard and waved!! It was soooo awesome. I'm in LOVE! haha. So we were getting really into the game, all was going well until the D-rays scored twice in the 3rd inning (i think.. lol).. and then they made some bullshit call on Brian Roberts that was supposedly a ""strikeout"" but it definitely wasn't, i mean it almost touched the ground! you should have seen my reaction.. I was pissed. Then, Brian made a spectacular catch and the 2nd base umpire said he didn't even CATCH IT! when clearly, he did.. and it was the most devastating thing that happened to me that night... other than the fact that WE DIDN'T GET FANS OF THE GAME! THIS STUPID LITTLE BOY WHO WASN'T EVEN SPORTING ANY ORIOLES ATTIRE GOT IT! I was sooo angry. There was also some haters all around us, bashing on our sign and the fact that we were actually INTO the game and not just getting drunk off our asses and making fools of ourselves. Because we're actually FANS and not just there to make fun of people. And there was this nasty couple that kept sucking face and we were slightly disturbed by it. The foul balls came near us, but never to us so we didn't have a chance to catch any. The guys behind us kept saying really funny stuff like when Sammy didn't make this catch in the corner they go ""Sammy, get more 'roids!"" and I guess you had to be there but it was hilarious. We also got on the Jumbotron TWICE! Count it, TWICE. It was fabulous! This really nice lady told the cameraman to get our sign on it and he did!! It was after the 8th inning, and it was totally awesome! I really did have the best time ever. After the game, they were interviewing Eric Byrnes and I got a close up of him talking to the reporter from Comcast. And then he was signing autographs, but we didn't get over there in time, he had already signed ""enough"" according to the old fartass usher. So we went pee since we hadn't even left our seats the entire game, and then I bought a pink o's visor and we headed out. When we were walking back to the parking garage these guys in this Xterra had their windows down and they yelled something and Cait's like ""holla"" cause they were hotties. Then there was this guy in a yankees hat screaming in Italian, and we were confuddled. Then we got in the elevator and there was a cucumber in there (I have a picture of it lol) it was hilarious.. lol. Then we drove past Camden and I rolled down the window and screamed ""B-ROB I LOVE YOUUUU"" and it was funny people were staring at me.. haha... but it was the best day of my life!! i love b-rob. wow."

He said ""Last time I checked, he didn't have to get a hit with a man on base or get an out with the bases loaded. What are you gonna do, say 'I don't like Maz, I'm not gonna get a hit? I grew up the son of a coach, and I saw my dad get fired and I knew it wasn't his fault.""

Isn't he darling? 

Awhile back before an Orioles game, Brian had visited a kid who had the same heart surgery as him (isn't that sweet?).

And when he was asked if he was on steroids after he hit his 8 homers in April, he responded with ""Hilarious. I'm as shocked as anyone, but I promise you, there's no magic potion""


I'M IN LOVE I TELL YOU!!!

and plus, i'm obsessed lol..."

And I hate it when people try really really really hard to be cool and for people to like them, I admit I have done it before but yeah when I was in junior high, come on now people! Wake the fuck up!

Sorry I am in a really pissy mood.

After sitting through Beauty and The Beast which wasn't all that great, I have decided that I hate people.

The end.

Nevermind. Caitlin, I hope you have the awesomest time at college. I will miss you terribly and this summer wouldn't be the same without you! I can't wait for our date in B-MORE. GOOD MORNING BALLLLTIMORE, ""grunts of exertion"", NEUTRAAIR, oh and mmmhmm."

This time I mean it. 
I really, really, really, really, really, REALLY like him.
But doesn't that sound so junior high?
I ADORE him. 
I CRAVE him. 
Wow. This is getting oddly sexual so this part of my entry is about to end.

Well it's currently 11:56 PM and I have to get up at 6:30 so I'm gonna make this a quickie.

I bought Harry Potter 6 Saturday. Had read half of it by Sunday Night. Finished it Tuesday afternoon. Cried my eyes out for an hour and a freaking half! WHY JK ROWLING? WHY! (Until all of you have finished reading it, I won't go into detail) but WHY?! I thought I liked you J.K. Rowling. I thought I trusted you! Oh well, whats done is done. (But at least you could keep my NEW FAVORITE COUPLE together!) 

I know everything will work out. 

My predictions for book 7: 
Harry dies.


Have a nice day."

and this one's for you""

So this is it. Freshman year, gone. Next year I'm going to be a sophomore!!! Yeah baby. So here's some things that I'm pondering.

1. Lauren Dianne did NOT get Junior Class President. Now I know the other girl has been in SGA for awhile, but Lauren is just better than her. I know, I'm a bitch, but hey I'm allowed right? 

2. Show choir is gonna be so different next year. I mean my sister's going to be gone, Bryant's going to be gone, and there's gonna be all these new people. It just gonna be strange to me, not bad, just strange.

3. I kinda feel like my family keeps things from me. Don't ask why, I just feel like they're always conspiring against me. Yes I know, paranoia. Whatev.

4. Senior show.. I'm going to DIE! Omgsh, its gonna be horribly saddening!! <3

5. People lying. Ugh, the lies. I really hate it, honestly. 

6. I LOVE MY FRIENDS! Who cares if they're not perfect, but they're pretty damn close!

Tonight was a pretty fun night with Lauren. We watched Bull Durham. Haha, its like ""rated-R"" lmao, even though Kevin Costner is BEAUTIFUL! CAN'T WAIT TIL JUNE 27th! I LOVE YOU DOLL!!

Tomorrow is the show and then we're going out and then I'm going to Ashley V's. Then in the morning we're going to church and JIMMY WAYNE is gonna be there! WOOT! and then I THINK we're going to go see the traveling pantolones movie and then MAYBE i'm gonna get my nails done, i dunno something. <3



Wow.. its a wonderful life right..

I just wish he didn't make it so hard for me to say EXACTLY what I need to, because I'm scared he'll hate me and thats far more to take than holding all my feelings inside. I really need to let it out sometime... 


<3 <3

""storm clouds may gather,
and stares may collide..
but i love you until the
end of time""

(can you tell i'm in a moulin rouge mood? totally)

hope you guys liked the REAL update <3"

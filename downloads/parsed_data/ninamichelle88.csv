My first official day of lifegaurding was Saturday, i had to open and close, i was there for a long time but it was all good and fun. We have radio walkie talkie thingys and we all play with them and like tell jokes and stuff while we are on gaurd duty, its so funny. My manager Mike told us this funny joke lol...""what did the bra say to the hat?"" ""you go a head i'll give these two a lift!"" lol i thought it was funny, he read it out of one of the girl's magazines. i am getting really dark which makes me happy! 

So we only have one more day of school! High school really flies by really fast i am amazed at how fast it has gone by and it is such a good time! It doesn't feel like we should really be getting out of school though and it doesn't feel like we should be taking finals either, its really weird. 

I really hate finals because i always get sick, because i don't sleep and am stressed out geez! and taking finals in general suck! One more final and im done baby!!! (going to be my hardest one spanish 2 Miculec)"

"event","so tonight torey and i went to go see A Lot Like Love, it was really really good! I think i might have to buy it when it comes out on dvd. This week has been kinda boring and depressing because of the bad weather, it sucks, i like rain, but only to a certain extent. I have also been sick this week so that could also be the problem. 

wednesday was a half day and i basically slept the whole day and then went running at about eight...yeah nice time to go for a run, actually it is. Thursday i went to swim practice like i should probably do everyday, but i am not in my season right now so i don't really care, but i know the only way i am going to get better is to practice! anyways yeah i went and it was soooo freaking hard, that practice probably had one of the hardest sets ever, or maybe it was that i was actually trying hard for a change, my coaches this year have been the best ever, they make you want to work hard and motivate you, and don't just piss you off. Plus i got better and we made 3rd at sectionals which is awesome.

I am starting to get more involved in things now, oh it only took me 2 years of high school to figure out what i would want to do there, but now i am a keyette i am also running for student council. i am doing newspaper next year, i am really looking forward to taking that class and i am currently in choir, hopefully i will be in chamber next year so we'll see, but i am going to be a busy girl next year. Andrea asked me the other day if i wanted to do yearbook i would actually really like to, but i have no freaking room in my schedule, i am taking academic english, us history, physics, pre-cal, newspaper, choir, and spanish 3... i might even run cross country next year, i have never run cross country before, but i run a lot, so i don't know, the eagan sisters are trying to get me to do it so i don't know yet. There are so many things i want to do and just not enough time to do them! 

i have started thinking about where i want to go to school, i am looking forward to going to college, i can't wait to meet new people and know what it feels like to be away from home, my dad always tells me how much he enjoyed college and how he loved every single moment of it. He made the best friends in college and we still hang out with their families all the time and go on trips together and have so much fun. They are all so close and i hope i get to have that experience. i want to go to IU or UNC, i dream of going to berkeley, but i don't think that will happen... and maybe purdue if i get really attached to this place i call home... i want to major in the medical field so yeah."

"event","So i haven't updated in awhile so i felt the need to do so. Not a lot has been going on. I went shopping and spent a lot of money as usual, i have a problem with spending money, especially if it isn't mine. lol, oh well. I had a meeting for work today, i am a lifeguard at the Elks club, i am thinking it is going to be a really fun and good job, i really like the people i am working with, three of the girls are swimmers at BC and they are all juniors, they are all really cute and funny. i love my bosses, they are brother and sister and they are both like 21 or 22 and so funny. After that i went over to Mel's to help her and the girls get ready for prom and just to see her all pretty in her beautiful prom attire! she looked gorgeous! Tomorrow i have Keyette induction or whatever, so that might be cool, i dunno. 

I really hate Indiana weather, it sucks! one day it is blazing hot and i love it, the next it is freezing cold and i freaking hate it, because whenever it gets cold i get head aches and it sucks. 

Alexine comes home in like two weeks or so! i can't wait to see her! She has changed a lot it seems she knows where her priorities are now. she seems like she has grown up a lot more, i just hope she stays that way. Her style has changed a lot now too, if you see her you will think that she is still living in the 60s. Last time i saw her was her spring break and she had all her hair in braids, but it did look kinda cool. she also wears like layers of clothes, one of her favorite ensembles is wearing black long jons under a skirt with layers of shirts, lol. Its cool though she looks different and unique, but she really has always been like that...different,lol. I have missed all our inside jokes and just talking for hours on the phone, we always are yelling at the other girls in her cabin dorm because we always go over the time limit we are allowed to talk on the phone, which is fifteen minutes, i mean gosh guys we are girls... Her taste in music has changed too...(this is kinda funny i am writing about alexine in my lj, like more than half of this entry is about her...oh well) Anyways her taste in music, she now listens to a lot more of the stuff i have been listening to for a while, before she left she was kinda in to some hard core stuff and now she listens to like ben kweller and jack johnson and a lot of old stuff like the momas and the popas, the eagles, simon and garfunkel and more... yeah so when she comes back that's what she is going to be like! 

ok i think i am done with this entry now, i'll have better updates soon! peace out!"

"event","ok so laura and torey both left messages on this thing for me to update...so i am. it has been one hell of a week, no month, i don't know i have just been hella busy lately. this past weekend was awesome, it was so sunny and bright and pretty and i laid out and tanned and it was great. Friday i went to Live at Graff and that was really cool, i missed it last year, which was a bummer, but i went this year! I must say James was amazing! All the bands and performers were really good. On Sunday Caroline, one of my official concert rockers, and i went to see our beloved Something Corporate, holy crap it was awesome! We got front row, because of our strong muscles? No mostly because i am charismatic lol... i made friends with this really big girl...i am meaning BIG, she was helping save spots up front for her friends so i made friends with her and she helped us get in the front. I wouldn't say that the concert was as good as the one last time at the Murat, but i thought the songs were played better and there were more songs played, it just kinda seemed like there wasn't as much energy and stuff, but that could have been due to the fact that there wasn't any crowd surfing and moshing allowed. The concert was in Valparaiso, i had never been up there before and i liked the town and the little university there too, it was cute and clean. 

soo...I started up swimming again, with boiler aquatics and i thought i would have been a lot more outa shape than i was, but it really wasn't all that bad, i was proud of myself lol. Kelsey told me that TJ, our coach said that i was pretty good...soo i don't know lol. well so far as i know that is as much news as i can remember right now... peace!"

"event","So i felt it was time for an update... My spring break wasn't as bad as  i thought it was going to be, even though i didn't do a whole lot. I got my wisdom teeth out last monday, it wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be, the first day was kinda tough though, i was on really strong pain killers and they kept making me fall asleep. I got really spoiled and pampered though, that was the good part! Melanie came from FL and brought me back this llama/camel string puppet lol. It is really cute. We finally concluded it is a camel, but i named it llama...this is the most retarded update yet... so anyways melanie knows how retarded i am so she bought that for me because i am random like that, a random gift. I am very random in fact i am so random that i am randomly writing this bs, ok...I love the fact that everyone in all my classes thinks i am very smart, i am smart i just act smarter than i really am in class. I just act like a smartass really, and it is quite easy to do all you have to do is use big words and act like you know what you are talking about and then you get an A and then everyone thinks you are smart. I spend a lot of money that i don't have... my mom bought me so much stuff at the mall the other day i am so broke. so this summer is going to rock mine starts out on a cruise!! its going to be great, rents making up florida to me! i feel so loved!

see how random i am...i like my life like that!

Alexine called me after i got out of surgy i doubt she understood anything i said because i was still totally out of it but it made me really happy she called. My sister was really worried about me the whole day my mom said she called my mom at least six times to see if i was ok. When i got home my sister told me that i had talked to her on the phone and the whole time i wasn't making sense and she kept saying i wasl like yelling 'am i on speaker phone?' for some reason. My mom said if i felt better after the surgery she would take me to the mall but we both knew that that was not going to happen, so as soon as they woke me up i was telling my mom and i don't even remember doing it but i was like walking all like was drunk and wasn't making sense when i talked she said i kept saying 'i want to go to the mall and try on swim suits!' i was really funny she said. i am really funny when chemicals are playing with my mind lol. my lip and chin are both totally numbed still and my face isn't swollen at all really and i hope it doesn't swell that much. i was really scared when i got there but as soon as then stuck the IV in i was totally gone it was quite nice. everyone in my family is being really nice to me lol. i like it. last night torey and i went to the super walmart across town and we like couldn't not find her car for like ten minutes we were wondering around the parking lot and i was laughing and other people were laughing at us because we could not find her car for the longest time. Turns out we parked all the way on the other side of the parking lot. lol. Also last night we were driving back to tor's house to go watch a movie and just hang out and stuff and we saw a car that looked exactly like david's i mean we actually thought it was david's car. so we turned around on the highway to see if it was but it wasn't it would have been funny if it was, but i am glad that at least it wasn't him that got a ticket lol. it is so nice outside today!! its great i hope it stays like this for a while. i am so glad duke lost!!! but it was sad that nc state lost too. Unc i hope is going to go all the way but they need to step up their defense to get there. well i am going to go lay down and relax. love ya'll, nina."

After we saw the play we stopped for subway and taco bell. It was like the second time i have ever been to taco bell, isn't that sad? lol i guess i am a deprived child when it comes to fast food. Its so funny because everyone in my english class thinks i am really smart because i use big words when i answer and ask questions because before i was in honors english and decided it was a waste of time. i am not going to major in anything that has to do with english and it was just taking up to much of my time. i think it is really funny. Its actually pretty cool though. This Indiana weather is just bugging the crap outa me. Why can't it decide just to be warm instead of going cold then colder and then getting warm again. Every time it goes from warm to cold i always get really bad head aches, it sucks. I think i am going to move to California, that's where i belong in good weather! i would so learn how to surf if i lived there it would be so cool! i want to learn how to surf, that is one of the things that i want to do before i leave this wonderful planet. Tonight is the OC and the start of the sweet 16. well i am gonna bounce!...Panini or whatever you call me..."

Dang... my spring break 2005 is going to suck! i have to get my wisdom teeth out and i am scared when they knock me out with the drugs that i won't wake back up lol. i told alexine this and she is like you should be more scared if something was to go wrong with your teeth. oh well. I went running with my sister sara yesterday, so that was fun and funny cause sara cracks me up all the time. when i am feeling down i go to her because she makes me laugh. we were running and she was running on the wrong side of the road and we were running on 400 and i was like sara youre gonna get your ass run over and she was like well its already flat. ok fine so you had to be there for it to be funny but o well i thought it was funny so i included it in this wonderful entry. we have two half days this week yay! that will be fun! i think tonight i am going to go work out and go tanning yeah now i think this entry is done because now i have nothing else to say except ""i think i am going to work out and go tanning"" so i am going to do that and you guys that read this thing enjoy it!"

I think it has also been a good experience for myself too i have learned more things about myself that i didn't know before, which that kinda sounds weird but its true. Today i went to the corec with mel and that was a lot of fun we were kicking ass! we first in the morning worked out and then later we swam, and damn am i out of shape for that! It felt so good though! ok here is how retarded i am: yesterday i really didn't ride the bus and really i never because i have awesome friends that drive me places lol, but anyways back to the story yesterday after school i went downstairs to see if torey or danielle were down there because i usually get rides from them, well i didn't see either of their cars or themselves, so i figured well shit now i have to ride the bus. so i run upstairs and try and catch the bus i heard their engines going so i started running like a complete idiot! the buses started pulling away and so did mine and i started running along side of it and looked so stupid and she didn't see me so i was like crap now i am probably stuck here at school or get a ride home from some one i don't really know. i walk inside and there is kirsti! thank god! i love that girl she is so awesome and she laughs at all my stupid jokes. so kirsti was a badass and took me home! she has a badass ford explorer, i would love to have that car, it would make me feel so much bigger and badder than everyone else. i didn't realize actually how small i look until today, when i looked in the mirror while i was lifting weights next to this really big guy. i have always thought of myself being taller than i really am which is kind of werid but i don't know i am weird o well! lol well that's about all i have to say for now unless i think of anything else to say later!"

"event","Auditions for ""Mame"" were today from 3PM-5:30PM, quite exciting actually!  I cannot believe it will be my, Carrie and Sara's last show together.  How depressing is that?  I have no doubt it will be the best and most successful though.;)  Am I right, ladies? hehe
I had volunteered to audition first.  My monologue was from ""At the Ballet"" from ""A Chorus Line,"" and my song was, ""Wherever He Ain't"" from ""Mack and Mabel."" ---Absolutely splendid belt-piece. 

As I walked into the room to audition first our director looked at me and said, ""we already know who YOU'RE getting!  So just audition to do it.""  So cast list will be up Friday morning, regardless of knowing who I'm going to be cast as, I'm still quite ecstatic to see the list.  I am really, really, really hoping that Sara is Agnes and Carrie is Vera.  That would be an absolutely perfect note to leave on. ::sigh::

Anyhow, I've decided to write John a brief letter telling him my role in the production:
Chrissy: ""If I get lead, write you, you'll come? ::in disbelief. lol::""
John:""If you get lead, send me the information in ENOUGH advanced notice, I will come.""

I am only hoping he isn't too busy. :(  I know at the moment he is in Japan with Julie, Rick, and Steve....gosh, I'd really love for him to bring Rick with him to come see ""Mame."" hehe  

Back to my point...I plan to write John on my 18th birthday telling him of my role and the show dates and detailed information and what not.  We did tease that they wouldn't contact me until after my 18th birthday. Hahaha, Funny, funny guys... lol

At the moment I am chatting with Heather, Stephanie, and Jim.  Jim read for ""Chino"" in ""West Side Story,"" I really hope he gets the part he wants! =-O  As for Heather, I really wish she would/could be happy.  It would make me as happy as anything for her to be happy or even content with herself.  She's such a dear and deserves to know that.  Stephy!  SUCH a sweet girl, wow, I am so glad we've become chums over the past few days.

Wednesday:  Tomorrow I have to be at Sherwood at 6PM tomorrow, I hope there isn't another snow storm on a Wednesday. lol.  Ah!  I cannot wait to tell Phil I'm going to be ""Mame"" and Stacey is going to be ""Maria"" in West Side Story!  Go us, Stace! lol  Yup.  We definitely rock socks. lol

SATURDAY NIGHT (Oh MY, I'm random): Jim, Stacey, Ilana and I drove to UIC at like 10:30PM and partied-hard.  Well I didn't really considering I don't drink...But hell, I don't need it! lol  I am goofy enough without the input of alcohol.  Jim....your lap dance...WOW! lol  May I just say, ""OOOOOOOOOOoh golly. hehehehehe, ::snort::"" LOL  That was an ENORMOUS ammount of fun, dear. lol  Thank you guys so much for inviting me!  ::sigh:: Bretton (sp?). lol  Jim, ....""watermelon!"" haha

Alright, well considering I have a Political Science test tomorrow third period and then from 6PM-Lord knows when I'll be singing...and hopefully out to coffee with my and Stacey's beloved ""Philippe.""  

Have a perfectly marvelous week, darlings!
Love, from

people with your attitude, but no doubt your church<br>is real happy
with you. The positive side certainly outweighs the<br>negative,
after all, you do chores, are smart, are cute, do<br>charity work.
Least you know what a perfect saint you are. You<br>just make the rest

   Leader  
Your sparkling personality, emotional strength, and flexibility make you the Leader. You are the kind of person that everyone trusts and respects. When there's a problem to be solved, you reflect thoughtfully on the issue and don't give up until you reach some kind of insight or creative solution. Others admire your take-charge attitude. Your high moral standards, diligence, and compassionate attitude do not allow you to stand idly by in the presence of any kind of injustice. You gravitate toward people and social activity, and others are drawn to you by to your gregariousness and charisma. Your hard work and open mind inspire and motivate others. You are a true leader."

"event","100% Polite!  What does your score mean?:

Are you, by any chance, a member of the Royal Family? You've got impeccable manners, and a standard of decorum high above that of the average Joe-blow. You wouldn't dream of behaving in a way that may offend or disgust others, and nearly always put decent social conduct above your own discomfort. This is a gift that certainly gives you the advantage in many situations - no one would hesitate to bring you home to meet the parents, for example. One warning though; the rules of decorum evolve with time (how many men you know would lay their jacket across a mud puddle for a lady friend?) and sometimes you can simply throw them out the window. No one expects you, for example, to buy your low-down ex a lavish wedding present. You have every right to be proud of your super-polite behavior, but don't get so hung up on etiquette that others take advantage of your good intentions."

"event","The King of Kindness
Your idea of the perfect prince is one that's sensitive and strong. He's attentive to your needs and even knows that while glass slippers are certainly beautiful, they just aren't comfortable footwear. (That's why he'll hold your purse for you while you shop for new shoes at the Nine West sale!) Your guy also understands why picking you up on his white horse (or in his Honda) is so much better than just meeting you at the restaurant -- even if it is the hottest new spot in the kingdom.

But the problem with getting the royal treatment on a regular basis is that even the most grateful girl is bound to get, well, bored. Your nice guy doesn't have to finish last though. Make sure that he understands your needs: space, a partner with a backbone, etc. But be nice about it. 

And if you landed in this category but haven't found a man who matches this description yet, take heart -- and a tip from author Wendy Paris. ""Whoever you are, you are someone's ideal,"" she says in Happily Ever After: The Fairy Tale Formula for Lasting Love. ""Hold out for someone who sees you as his."" What better way to live happily ever after!"

If you scored 60% or above: When they sang ""Tradition"" from Fiddler on the Roof, they were singing your song! Forget trends, forget fads, you invest your money in time-honored styles. Get subscriptions to Traditional Home Magazine, Southern Living and Victoria for great style ideas.

You scored 20% Modernist
If you scored 60% or above: You were ready for the new Millennium before anyone else, and you have a style-forward decorating sense that always combines form and function. Your home is a shrine to great 20th century modern home accessories. If you want to add to your collection, go to great websites like: retromodern.com, modemoderne.com, modcity.com, and simplymodern.com. 


You scored 10% Eclectic
If you scored 60% or above: Coloring in the lines was never your strong suit. You live to mix and match colors, textures, periods, and prices! A Louis XVI chaise lounge looks amazing sitting next to a Philippe Starck acrylic chair or a shantung silk beanbag chair. The element of surprise gives you a thrill so you're constantly moving things around. 

If you scored 60% or above: Looking to the past gives you inspiration. Flea markets and tag sales are where you get your best ideas. You've even been known to refinish a few flea market finds on your own. And, you probably know stores like Restoration Hardware and Anthropologie like the back of your hand. Installing reproduction light fixtures, faucets, and doorknobs are your favorite ways to add the retro touch to your home without breaking the bank. Some good websites to add to your favorites: ballandball-us.com, kennedyhardware.com, and salvageone.com.

In romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Water Signs. You seek a mate who is kind and compassionate, not afraid to feel, someone to whom you can really bare your soul. You appreciate romance and sentiment, and though the man you long for may be a bit shy or innocent, he is very, very generous and open-minded. You'd probably love to be with a Cancer, a Scorpio or a Pisces lover. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires.


You scored 30% Earth
In romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Earth Signs. You're turned on by affluence and opulence. While you crave status and security, you also want a man with a sensual streak as strong as his stock portfolio. You like to take things slowly and make informed decisions, so you may find a Taurus, a Virgo or a Capricorn lover to be the sexiest match for you. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires.


You scored 30% Air
In romance, you're drawn to the qualities of an Air Sign. You're turned on by a man's intellect and sense of humor more than his net worth or fine physique. You desire a mate who will match you wit for wit and keep you up all night talking. Air Signs prefer to keep things light and even, so if you want love that's playful, you might be most turned on by a Gemini, a Libra or an Aquarius mate. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires.


You scored 0% Fire
In romance, you're drawn to the qualities of a Fire Sign mate, someone ambitious, ardent and active. You don't like hesitant men -- you like a guy who'll take a chance and make the first move. Impatiently passionate, you need someone who will show you a good time -- and the world. You have a good chance of finding happiness with an Aries, a Leo or a Sagittarius man. Read more about these Sun Signs to discover more about their motivations and desires.

"event","How I Approach Life and How I Appear To Others:

You are a natural diplomat, reasonable, tolerant, fair, always willing to listen to varying viewpoints, and ready to see the other side of an issue. Even if you strongly disagree with someone, you will try to find points of similarity and agreement rather than emphasizing the differences. You often avoid taking an extreme or one-sided stance on anything. You have a strong desire for harmonious and pleasant relationships, and express a spirit of cooperation, compromise, friendship, and fairness. You very much want to be liked and because of your need for approval and acceptance, you are easily influenced by others' opinions, especially when young. You so much want to please that often you will suppress your own intense or unpleasant feelings in order not to offend others. Sometimes your politeness is interpreted as phoniness or wishy-washiness. 


The Inner Me: My Real Motivation:

You are a freedom-loving, strong-willed, and independent-minded individual, and you insist upon living your own life as you see fit, even if that means ignoring convention and tradition. In personal relationships you cannot be owned or possessed, and while you are willing to share yourself with another, you do not always adjust easily to the emotional give and take of a close relationship. Though intellectually open, you can be enormously stubborn, opinionated, and inflexible on a one-to-one level. You have strong convictions and feelings about fairness and equality, and you try to live by your ideals, but your ideals about how people SHOULD treat one another don't always take into account human weaknesses, differences, and needs. You probably dislike sentimentality and traditional gender roles and ""games""."

Just winding down from a tres bien weekend!  Wednesday evening my dear, dear chum Eliza came home to visit (she's leaving tomorrow night! oh no!) from New York City so she and Ariel slept over.  Ron stopped by for a wee bit and we hung out, chatted about, and played cards.  Later that night we drove over to Joe's house and hung out there watching ""Big Fish"" until nearly 2AM.  That was tres fun as well, we were taking turns with giving and receiving back massages. hehe J'adore my chums. lol

Then we got home at like 2AM (like I just said.. hehe) and Eliza and Ariel fell right asleep, especially Eliza. ::giggles::  and I went to clean my brother's bedroom (for $20.00!) so I did that until about 3AM and then Guinness was growling at Ariel because she walked into his bedroom.  Sorry girlie! hehe

But the night was awesome and it concluded with Ariel and I sitting up talking until 4:25AM.  We got to talk about a lot of things, I really enjoyed it.  And I sure am glad that we get to have our occasional little chats about everything and anything we'd like.

After sleeping soundly for about 3hrs our alarm went off at 7:30am so they could get back to Ariel's at 8am for Eliza's mum to pick her up. :)  

Friday was a fun day as well!!  It began with my best best best chum coming over, we had chicken, stuffing, and Little Caesars and it was yummy.  And then a few friends came over and we watching some movies and goofed around a lot.  Amanda and I watched our ""Together Again"" DVD and played dress up and were singing along.  Twas tres tres tres fun!!  I'm so glad we have so much fun together. ::giggles::

And theeeen by the time everybody left we watched a little bit of ""Blind Fury"" with Rutger Hauer (love him) and were soo sleepy so we went to sleep around 2AM-ish.  ...Only to have to wake up byu 8:30AM because Kylie would be picking us up.  So Kylie searched our house for some items to bring back to her condo in Roger's Park and then we were on our way. :)  We called Kylie's sister-in-law, Jamie, to come over so we got to pick her up on the way to Ky's place.  

So when we stopped by at Bryan's family house we got to chat with George (of the Jungle!) for a bit..that's Bryan and Jamie's mum AKA Mrs. Heuer and she is such an oh-so-awesome lady.  Can you say Mrs. June Cleaver? Teehee, She's sooo nice!

So we got back to Kylie's place, we walked Skyler, went to Starbucks (YUMMY VENTI CARMEL FRAPACINNO W/ EXTRA CARMEL!)!  And then we stopped at the store on the way back, so Kylie could buy toothpaste, hehe  And while Kylie was in the store, Jamie, Amanda and I were outside with Skyler-- talking about the possibility of it growing so cold outside that it results in the freezing of urination.  It was quite an exuberant and random topic, thanks to James. lol

Later when we got home we charged my phone and played Cranium!! Wooohoooo!!  While watching ""License to Drive"" with Corey Haim.  And then a bit later we had to go drop Jamie off at home, pick Bryan up for work, and then Bryan bought us Burger King!  Twas tres yummy!  And I had forgotten my phone!  Oh no!  So I kept using Ky's cell to check my voicemail because we had been waiting for a phonecall and we had been hastening out the door so it'd definitely slipped my mind to grab it. :(  But hey, it got to charge!! ::giggle::  Anyhow, and then Kylie set up a reeeeally nice bath for Amanda with classical music, candles and all so she could relax and then I took a bath and then when I took a bath I'd asked Amanda to study since she has a test tomorrow.  So wooo she got to study Econ., those darned industrialists. ::giggle:: hehe 
 
Hmmm when we came home what did we do?  Oh yeah!
We watched ""Lying Eyes,"" a Lifetime movie and then went to sleep.  And today Bryan went to play football for work (don't ask) and the game ran late so he couldn't get home until 2pm and then we left right away to drive Amanda home.  So we hurried there but then there was like this jazz concert or something down there so traffic was pretty packed for a smidgen.  But then we made it. :)

GREAT weekend and I am going to go do a bit of writing now.  Have a tremendous week!

Love, from
Christina

"event","So I gave in and made a trendy myspace. Ew, I feel dirty just admitting that. Anyway, I won't be around here, really. Not like I have been as of late.

There's so much drama in newspaper lately. Oh we're so controversial. The paper didn't go out the day before break because of a few  articles (we get regular hate mail), and there was apparently a name of a student in our newspaper who is supposed to remain confidential (witness-protection, perhaps?) So that was a huge mess and upset. So my article (see below) isn't going out because it's old news. We had to take out all the holiday articles. LAME. 

So yeah. Bye everyone <3"

"event","Between twinkling lights, traditional music, chilly weather, and family gatherings (okay, maybe that was a bit of a stretch), the Christmas season is one of my favorite times of the year. So every December, I am surprised to find cynics mumbling bitterly about the holidays instead of spreading the holiday cheer. ""Too much hassle,"" they say. It's always one excuse or another. ""I'm broke,"" or, ""I'm an agnostic,"" or most commonly, ""Christmas is all about commercialism.""

So if this is true, does this mean I shun the two-tone festive metamorphosis that comes at the end of every year? Am I upset by this holiday consumerism? Do I knit sweaters and design crafts instead of buying presents? Of course not. I march out to the mall with pride, equipped with my wallet and paper filled with present ideas to show my appreciation of those I love. I realize that December brings a major economic boost to this country, so I applaud the purchasers of the world, whether they're buying gifts out of love or duty. Given, there will always be exceptions, such as the parents who will buy anything and everything for their greedy children, but despite this, I think we all get a kick out of the die-hard mothers who show up at 5 A.M. the day after Thanksgiving to get all of the latest toys.

Yes, the irritating pop princesses and their over-sung Christmas albums, oozing fabricated holiday spirit and raping the traditional music we've come to love, are one of the lows of this time of year, but you've got to admire their lack of shame for trying to add to their fortunes by tapping into the holiday pool of wealth. And frankly, at least they're not the rappers who are too afraid to put out Christmas rap songs because it will show their soft side and lower their ""cool and delinquent"" factor. So, as my alter ego, ""Feminem,"" you'll be pleased to know that my first single will indeed be a two-minue rap about my homie-Jesus.

Honestly, friends, without buying, there would be no giving. Call me a sucker for loving the way people's faces light up upon receiving a gift, but I honestly believe ""tis the season to be jolly."" If you're going to be bitter or cynical, do the rest of us silly holiday saps a favor and save your attitude for the other eleven months in the year. It can be your own present to the world, and after all, giving is what it's all about."

"event","WHOA. So. Not like anyone really cares, but I'm back riding my favorite kickass horse named William again. Two more days to Thanksgiving Break. Dear lord I need a vacation. Anyways, I'm going to tell you random moments that have happened to me lately. So sit down and shut up sweethearts :D

1. My car got egged. Who the fuck would egg my car. You little bastard, I will track you down and shoot your penis off. 
2. My dog had surgery! Aw, that was a sad day.
3. I'm getting a bass soon. Mmmm. Bass. Why bass, you ask? Because I'm too pathetic to play electric. I don't got the skills, yo. So I figure I can just look hot and jam on my bass, lol. Stef and I should start a band.
4. Hm, speaking of Stef. We shoplifted from the dollar tree. Yes that's right kids, The Dollar Tree. Where everything is a dollar. It's not like we MEANT to...I mean hell, it was a cheap little ribbon that said ""I can dress myself!"" that we were going to give to Colleen because it kicked so much ass, but we ended up walking out of the store with it on accident and we were too scared to go back. >_>
5. I found out that football is fun.
6. I HATE college applications.
7. Oceans 12 is coming out soon and I'm so freaking stoked for that.
8. Oh, and Bush needs to die. And Condoleezza Rice has a freaking WEIRD name.

AND NOW, ladies and gentlemen, and emo poem brought to you by yours truly.

Maybe something you say could save me
Here's your chance, kiss me baby."

Despite your pseudo-bohemian appearance that vaguely set your doctrine of beliefs, you know nothing of art or sex that you couldn't read in any trendy new york underground fashion magazine. Proto-typical non-conformist, you are a vacuous soldier of the thrift store gestapo. You adhere to a set of standards and tastes that appear to be determined by an unseen panel of hipster judges 
(BULLSHIT)
giving your thumbs up and thumbs down to incoming and outgoing trends and styles of music and art. Go analog baby, you're so post-modern. You're diving face forward into an antiquated past, it's disgusting! It's offensive! Go stick your nose in it! Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself? You spend your time sitting in circles with your friends, pontificating to each other, forever competing for that one moment of self agrandizing glory in which you hog the intellectual spotlight, holding dominion over the entire SHALLOW....POINTLESS...conversation. 
Oh we're not worthy. 

When you walk by a group of ""normal"" people, you chuckle to yourself, patting yourself on the back as you scoff. It's the same superority complex shared by the high school jocks who made your life a living hell, and it makes you a slave to the competitive capitalist dogma you spend every moment of your waking life BITCHING about! 

Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself? You're free to whine. It will not get you far. I do just fine, my car and my guitar. I'm proud of my life and the things that I have done, proud of myself and the loner I've become. 

Well let me tell you this, I am shamelessly self involved. I spend hours in front of the mirror to make my hair elegantly disheveled. I worry about how this album will sell because I believe it will determine the amount of SEX I will have in the future. I self-medicate with drugs and alcohol to help treat my extreme social anxiety problem. You are a FAKER! You are a FRAUD! You're living a LIE! You don't impress me! You don't intimidate me! ADMIT IT! Why don't you bow down, lie on the ground, then walk this fucking plank! 

I'm proud of my life and the things that I have done, proud of myself and the loner I've become. You're free to whine. It will not get you far. I do just fine, my car and my guitar, and I am done with this. I wanna taste the breeze of every great city; my car and my guitar. You're urgently unfulfilled, when I'm dead I'll rest.

"event","So last night I went to a party for Kevin's band. Each band member was supposed to invite like 10 people or something, but it wasn't quite that big. So Colleen and I hung out for a bit, then they started playing and we took a seat in some chairs by the pool. After they played for awhile they took a break and Colleen went over to Kevin so he could introduce her to some of his old friends. So I was sitting there watching Tom and Mike? (I think those were their names...the cute stoner kids obsessed with Stairway to Heaven) and out of the blue, David, the guitarist whose house the party was at, came over and asked if I wanted to hang out with the people he was talking to. So he picked up my chair and sat it next to all his friends and it was so nice! I was shocked, because I'd written him off before without knowing him. He was usually always quiet when I went over to Kevin's to watch them play, so I refered to him as ""The one that never talks."" I feel so guilty for doing that, because he was so nice and really cool. I think I do that way too often: writing people off before I even know them. I'll judge people before even giving them a chance, and its absolutely horrible. I feel like such a jerk.

I spilled yogurt on my left arrow key. It's bothering me, but its too gross to clean out.

So in an hour I leave for a trail ride. My stables is moving to a new place but its not too far away so we're trail riding through the woods at this nearby park to the new facility. I haven't ridden William on a trail ride yet, so I'm really nervous. I mean....it's like a recipe for disaster: he's young, a Thoroughbred, and we'll be outside the arena. Horses take on totally different personalities when they're not in their familiar surroundings. I mean, the snap of a twig could spook him, and the last time a horse spooked with me on him I ended up in the emergency room and they were cutting my clothes off. Ugh I'm scared shitless.

And I'm so confused. Everything with my friend starts out as something silly then escalates to a total emotional chaos. I don't know what I did or how to fix it. Arg."

"event","Yesterday was a blast, as far as furniture shopping can be. I went down to San Fran to go to Ikea with Colleen and Elaine because Colleen is re-doing her whole room. That store is the coolest thing ever. I could so live there. We spent like 4-5 hours there and spent...well...a shitload of money. Her room is going to be awesome. :) On the way home we stopped by Garrett and Kurt's house and hung out with Garrett for a bit. When I got home at around 10, I just crashed.

I'm going to start riding William on Wednesdays too. That way I'll have a dressage lesson during the week and a jumping lesson on Saturday. I really need to get back into shape, my muscles protest every time I ride him. Aw but I love him to pieces, he's so much fun.

I had three consecutive nightmares last night, it sucked. I'd have one, wake up, go back to sleep, have another, and so on. In one I was running along this path and these like fanatics were screaming in the woods for ""Carrie"", like that one horror movie. And they were dressed in white nightgowns. I've never even seen that movie. X_X  After that I had a dream I was riding William and then Taryn fell off Pete and her hand just fell off. There wasn't blood or bone, just skin, and to put it back on, Mira just had to press it back on. I was so scared because I totally didn't understand, there was no logic to it whatsoever.

"event","Last night was CRAZY. It almost reminded me of a Sex and the City episode, except minus the sex.

First the six of us went to dinner and spent hours talking about some very...interesting topics. Example: Monica watching porn with her boyfriend. LOL, don't EVEN ask me. It was lesbian porn or something too. Boys are...strange. Towards the end, Lindsey's flavor of the week joined us to chat for a bit. Monica and Kayla tried to leave Robyn and my phone number on a napkin for the waiter, but I saw her and stole it before they could get away with it. I'm not even sure the waiter was straight.

After that we headed back to Robyn's to store leftovers and park our cars, then we all jumped in Lindsey's Explorer to go to Mark and Monica's, a local sports bar and karaoke place. With the six of us crammed into a 5-seater SUV, we rolled down the windows, blasted the music and screamed and honked at every car carrying male passengers under 30. When we got there, Linds bumped into like 3 guys she knew and we sat at a booth next to some of Monica's guy friends. They were SO adorable when they went up there to sing. There were some people there that were like HARDCORE karaoke singers though, they were damn good. Kayla and I pleaded to sing Spice Girls, but Rob and Mon wanted Respect, so we butchered our way through that song instead. And little miss Colleen almost chickened out on us. We almost decided to hook up with the guys back at their place where they had a pool table and stuff, but a few had curfews so we said we'd do it another night.

Riding this morning was awesome. In case I failed to mention, I'm riding a new horse. He's GORGEOUS, 17 hands and an Irish Thoroughbred named William. Funny how that is too, Will is one of my favorite names and I've never met a William I didn't like. Anyways, Jane was teaching the lesson since Kathy and my friends are at the big show, and she really helped me get a jumpstart to learning how to ride him. Man is it weird to have a horse that actually CAN bend and collect, unlike stiff Francis. Sigh, I'm in love.

Anyways, tonight should be interesting."

"event","<i>Please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast.</i>

Yesterday never stopped. 

<i>Tell us a story, I know you're not boring.</i>

I woke up at 7 and went to the barn around 8. When I got there, Kathy told me that some stupid idiots were setting off illegal fireworks over the Fourth of July, and Geoffery, being the high-strung thoroughbred that he is, had absolutely freaked out. He ran into the fence and got his hoof stuck in it and couldn't get it out. He eventually pulled with so much force that the entire fence came crashing down on him. He fell over and onto a wooden stake or something from the fence and went absolutely dead lame. He was dragging his leg and couldn't walk straight. Kathy was worried he'd completely dislocated his leg, but the vet told her that instead he had ripped his muscle in half. He said it might take up to 6 months to fully recover, but Geof has already made an outstanding recovery in just 2 weeks. 

<i>The wait is over, I'm now taking over.</i>

So now that Geof is lame, Mira has to ride Francis for the big show coming up next weekend. Meaning I had to ride a different horse. Kathy gave me the option of riding either Madison (who I haven't ridden in AGES, and he's getting old just like Franny is T_T) or William, the new Irish Thoroughbred they bought recently. I decided to try out William (after all, Will is one of my favorite names and I've never met a Will I didn't like :D) and just give it a shot. Oh my god. He's SO HUGE. He's around <a href=""http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/pages/info/horsehandsconverter.html"">17 hands high</a>, meaning I can't even see over his withers (back/shoulders area). Anyways, he's so much fun!! Totally different than I'm used to riding, but a blast nonetheless. Apparently everyone said I looked perfect on him, size and everything. Kathy told me that he was the best horse for me to move up on, so from now on I get to ride William! <3 Finally, I've been riding Francis for forever. Yay. William :D *sighs*

<i>You're in a strange part of our town.</i>

So after I got home, I changed and showered quickly and went to SacState the Olympic Track and Field Trials to spend ""quality time"" with my dad. It was pretty fun, but hot as hell. We saw the pole vaulting, triple jump,  javelin and decathalon events along with the women's 100m and a few other races. Man, this Greer guy for javelin is craaazy. And and this one guy that wasn't even on the list as being a real contender blew everyone AWAY on the triple jump. It was crazy. But I seriously have never seen more athletic and fit people in my life. It made me feel like crap! lol >_>

<i>The night's not over, you're not trying hard enough.</i>

So after I got home from that around 5, Kayla picked me up and we went to Ben & Jerry's to visit Colleen and Robyn. We ate cookie dough balls and chilled for a bit then left to go to Monica's house for a movie night. So we watched 10 Things I Hate About You and then Rob joined us for Ocean's 11. Kayla's getting pretty good, she may soon know all the lines to it like I do. :D

<i>Our lives are changing lanes, you ran me off the road.</i>

After Rob and Kayla and I discussed options for our little um...secret party thing, we left. On the way home, this chick in some white explorer pulled up next to us at the light and then sped off in front of us as soon as the light turned green. We ended up catching up to her later and pulling up next to her again, and then she started shaking her head at us. We were like WTH?! and Kayla called her a bitch LOL. And then I went home.

<i>You sound so sleepy, just take this now leave me.</i>

So tired...I'm going to sleep..."

"event","<DIV>Just got back from a fabulous adventure in lovely San Luis Obispo. I drove to Napa and joined my grandma, my aunt and my cousin Lea (who will be a senior at Cal Poly next semester). Together we drove down to San Luis to take some stuff to Lea's new apartment. We met up with Lea's brother, my cousin Scott (he's going to be a junior in college) and went out to dinner along with Lea's boyfriend Mike. They are SO cute together, Mike is an adorably fun and dorky guy and it made me jealous to see them being so cute. I want a boyfriend to be cute with! Grrr. Anyways. We went to ice cream that night and ate ourselves sick. We went back to Lea's apartment and watched Pimp My Ride and I fell asleep on this really comfortable bean bag char thing while they cuddled and fell asleep on the couch. I always thought bean bags were like hippy junk, but this thing was damn comfy. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The next day we visited Cal Poly and then went to lunch at Scott's restaurant. I saw a cross-dresser there! It was a man that was like dressed as a woman and he had boobs but a very deep voice. &gt;_&gt; After that, we headed to the beach. After getting thoroughly <s>tan</s> sunburnt, we went back to the hotel and hung out until dinner time. Then we went to this place for dinner and <s>talked</s> gossipped about the rest of our family. That night, Scott invited me to go to this party with him. He told me it was a theme party...and I was like well what's the theme? He then told me that it was a&nbsp;um, prison-themed party kinda, where a bunch of his friends were going to&nbsp;dress up as prison thugs and the&nbsp;girls dress up as hookers or something,&nbsp;and there might be like girls from Playboy or something&nbsp;there. I was like hmm...maybe next time. Parties with college guys with beer and girls dressed like skanks kinda scare me. I told him I didn't have anything to dress up in anyways, and he replied, ""That doesn't matter, you're my cousin so you can do whatever you want."" That still didn't comfort me much.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The next day we moved some stuff into Lea's apartment and then walked around downtown. And guess what was going on that very day in the plaza! A Gay Pride festival! So we walked around and looked at the booths where they had stuff for sale. It was cool. XD We went back to Scott's apartment afterwards and looked at his pictures from the party. They were...lovely. And his roommate.&nbsp;*dies* One of the hottest guys I've seen in awhile that wasn't in a band. He was gorgeous, and a surfer. &lt;3 Scott and his friends are all surfers, so its really really nice to visit down there. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That was pretty much it. The&nbsp;drive home was way too long. From Napa to Sac I was going like 84. &nbsp;&gt;_________&gt;</DIV>
<DIV>And now I'm home.</DIV>
<DIV>And I must get a job.</DIV>

<DIV><EM></EM>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT size=5>Warped Tour was fucking amazing.</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT size=5></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I could just die. Because of Colleen's torturious teeth appointment for some random thing with her jaw, we didn't hit the road until like 11:30ish. And the traffic was HORRIBLE, there was construction on the only freeway that led to Marysville. So we got there about 1:30 (we missed Alkaline Trio, Britney was sooooo upset). When we got there we headed straight for the Teal stage for Taking Back Sunday, and while we were waiting we watched Coheed and Cambria do their thing on the stage next to us. I'd heard they suck live but they weren't all that bad. They sure are creepy though.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Taking Back Sunday</STRONG> is my hero. I can't even express in words how awesome it was to see them, since I missed their performance at the Boardwalk a few months ago. I was in heaven...Adam Lazarra was amazing, and it was better than I ever thought it could be. Kevin and Colleen were laughing at me because I was so into it. And then I dared Britney to drink out of this guy's camel pack in front of us, but his friend next to him caught her and ratted her out, it was so funny. And the guy replacing John Nolan was really good. OH, and they played NEW STUFF, like two new songs. I was in shock, it was amazing. And I really liked the songs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Lets see...who was next...OH, <STRONG>My Chemical Romance</STRONG>. They were really good, it's crazy how bands can sound exactly like your hear them on CD, when I just naturally assume that they've been edited up the ass. The lead singer was really cool, he was telling everyone that if they see someone making fun of homosexuals or people that act differently, to ""give them the fucking finger."" So after they performed, the lead singer from Guttermouth started bashing the lead singer of MCR because he wears makeup and isn't afraid to be different. That guy was the biggest asshole I've seen in my entire life, like those 12-year-old kids that play CS and do shit just to piss you off. Why do people have to sink so low as to make fun of other people just to look cool? And then Kevin started dissing guys that wear makeup so I smacked him and called him a fucking homophobe and walked away lol. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I think we saw <STRONG>Yellowcard</STRONG> next, after waiting in line forever for Britney to meet Alkaline Trio. It sucked, we were way far away because it was packed and we got there only 5 minutes before they started playing. They have this huge fan base now, and I miss when they were hardly known. It was a lot cooler when I saw them at The Boardwalk, because it was a more personal show and not that many people knew them. But they still rocked as hard as ever...Sean on the violin makes the most hilarious faces ever. And he did his famous backflip too, it was leet. They played all their new stuff, it was a&nbsp;totally different set than they played at the Boardwalk.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After shopping around more we saw <STRONG>Brazil.</STRONG> Britney and I were right up front against the rail closest to the stage. It was awesome, Brazil is one of the coolest bands I've heard in a while. The lead singer was so nice too, and man is the lead guitarist crazy. He was playing his guitar like a madman. I'm in love with this band now. Go listen to them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And last, but oh-so-definitely-not-least, was <STRONG>The Matches.</STRONG>&nbsp;Can someone please kill me now? I have officially seen the most attractive man on the planet. Again, Brit and I were right up front against the rail and feeling the sweat fly off their faces. I was in heaven. The lead singer...oh my fucking god. I dont understand how a man could possibly be so attractive. He was like a punked-out, eyeliner-stylin&nbsp;version of Johnny Depp, but like 500x hotter. And his smile was just amazing. They were awesome, although the singer's mic was kinda low. But they rocked so hard, he jumped down onto the rail like 5 times and sang to us right in our faces. The lead guitarist kept like throwing shit at Britney and I, not intentionally I hope, but like he threw a can of whatever free drink they were drinking and kicked this box down off the stage too. I just...I don't even know what to say. The Matches are incredible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I think those were all the main bands we saw. I saw pieces of New Found Glory and Early November and a few others but those were the most memorable. I have so much free stuff and shirt and junk that I don't even know what to do with myself. I got the sickest Taking Back Sunday poster ever. I'm trying to think of other things we did....hmm. Oh, Colleen did this like pull-up contest thing for the Marines and won a shirt lol. And....oh I came within 5 feet of Taking Back Sunday, they had a meet and greet going on at this booth but the line was so freaking long that I just went around the back and took pictures of them. Anyways, that's about it. *dies*</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And now I leave for Napa and then on to San Luis Obispo to visit my cousin at Cal Poly. I might be back Sunday or Monday, not sure which.</DIV>"

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Anyways, that's not the tone I wanted to use to set the mood for this post, but whatever. This weekend rocked. I went to Mt. Lassen/Lake Almanor area to my Aunt's cabin. My whole mom's side of the family was there: my three aunts, three uncles, two sorta-aunts, 4 cousins and then my mom and <s>the devil&lt</s> stepdad. Friday we drove up, but for the life of me I can't remember what we did that day. I know we went on a walk and got attacked by these killer bugs...god I hate bugs. My 19-year-old cousin Lani (the one I'm closest to) bent down to look at this huge-ass beetle. I warned her that it probably could fly, but she shrugged it off. She was about to poke it with a stick when another one landed on her hand. It was classic.</DIV>

<DIV><lj-cut text=""Saturday was boring.""> Saturday a bunch of other relatives that I barely know stopped by to visit. It was then we decided that one of the people looked exactly like the cousin from Vegas Vacation. Their resemblance was almost frightening. There was a kid with all those people too, and I can now say that I know pretty much everything about this kid's life. He NEVER shut up. So here's what I know. Because you care oh-so-much.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>His name is Jeremy. He's 17 years old and about to be a junior in high school (which freaks me out that he's a year older than me but a grade younger...and then I realized I'm going to be 16 years old when I start my senior year, which seems so very wrong). He goes to school at Del Campo in Fair Oaks. He plays basketball and he's a point-guard for his team, which apparently is like the best team ever (whatever). He's enlisting in the Air Force because he wants to be a commercial pilot. And now I'm getting really bored talking about this weird 15th cousin twice removed or whatever the hell he is. He was even flirtatiously throwing bugs at me, which I really didn't appreciate seeing as bugs scare the hell out of me.</lj-cut></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Anyways.&nbsp;Saturday night my kinda-Aunt Carla and my uncle Rick got this crazy idea of climbing Mt. Harkness at night to see the moon rise (it was full or something). They said it was like 2 miles up and back, so I'm like alright whatever, I'll do it. So we drive up to the trail head and start climbing this huge ass mountain. It was about 8:30. Let me tell you, this mountain was no little 2-mile hill. This&nbsp;thing was a beast, and with the added elevation and thin air, it's no walk in the park. After almost losing the trail where the snow covered it (yes, there was even snow in July in California), we finally made it to the top. The moon was incredible and the stars....I swear you could see every star that was ever made. The view was amazing too, you could see out over everything.&nbsp; By the time we made it back down and back home, it was about 1:30 in the morning and my feet were bleeding from blisters. Lovely, ain't it?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The next morning (July 4th) we went to the biggest hick parade ever in the nearby town of Chester (population small-enough-for-everyone-to-know-each-other) &nbsp;I mean these people were like hardcore Americans, decked out from head to toe in red white and blue. And here comes my two older cousins, my brother and I, none of us wearing any patriotic colors whatsoever. Lani's got like&nbsp;a Banana Republic shirt on, Matt and Kris are wearing like American Eagle shirts and aviator shades and we all stand out like crazy next to these hick people in their sleeveless tie-dye shirts. I went around whispering ""Vote John Kerry! Stop deforestation!"" expecting to get stoned to death. The parade was hilarious, Kris (who is the spitting image of a&nbsp;22-year-old Tom Cruise)&nbsp;and I were making fun of and cheering for every useless part in the parade. Good times, good times. And man oh man, there are some Chester hotties, lol.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So the whole trip when we weren't doing anything else we were either reading People or US or doing puzzles. And all the magazines were about ""Saving Mary-Kate"" and her whole anorexia thing. So during dinner I wasn't feeling all that hungry and didn't eat, so they all started calling me Mary-Kate. :( I AM NOT MARY-KATE. Just so you all know. I eat. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Anyways, that night we decided to go home early. So here I am, bored to tears. Someone save me :(</DIV>"

New style/colors for this puppy. I think I like it? Had to do it all without PSP so the colors aren't exactly what I wanted as I used a standard color code site. ><

Anways, packing time. Peace out.

"event","<i><font size=1>When everything you'll get is everything that you've wanted, princess,
Well which would you prefer?
My finger on the trigger, or me face down, down across your floor?</i></font>

Now that my best friend has her little boyfriend Kevin, she's beginning to ditch me for him. It makes me just not want to talk/hang out with her at all, but then again that sorta ruins my argument. Thank god he's been out of town a lot lately. So apparently they have tickets to the warped tour. I was like, sweet now I have people to go with. So I ask, ""Hey, it's cool if I go with you guys right?""

<i><font size=1>This all was only wishful thinkin'.</i></font>

So she replies, ""I don't know, I guess so. I haven't talked to Kevin yet, but I'm sure we'll want to go off on our own too."" So basically this tells me that I can go...but once I'm there they'll eventually end up ditching me to go make out or some crap after a while. Fantastic. 

<i><font size=1>You're such a sucker for a sweet talker, yeah.</i></font>

So for those of you that have never been to the Warped Tour or seen any pictures of it, it's basically a huge rock/punk concert held in a parking lot with about 8 or so different stages and tons of booths and stuff. So it's totally packed with people and there's moshers everywhere and its just....huge. So...if they were to ditch me, I'd be basically lost and alone in the midst of hundreds of rockers, some of which are a bit...well, slightly frightening. Hmm, sounds like fun.

<i><font size=1>Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens;
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins.</i></font>

So being me, I just go ""Oh, okay,"" 'cause well, what am I going to accomplish by saying anything on my mind? Life's taught me to just shut up and get over it, because having an opinion doesn't usually help.

<i><font size=1>I stay wrecked and jealous for this, for this simple reason.
I just need to keep you in mind as something larger than life.</i></font>

So after hanging up I feel immediately bummed out, and now I'm clueless as to what to do. Do I go? There's always the offchance that I can recruit someone else to go with me but it just wouldn't be as fun as hanging out with my best friend (minus the boyfriend). I mean, I know if I don't go I'll be jealous as hell when she comes back raving about all the bands she saw. They don't even KNOW a quarter of the bands playing, and that bothers me for selfish reasons. Music is my life, but I don't want to go and have a shitty time because of them. 

<i><font size=1>Why can't I feel anything from anyone other than you?</i></font>

And going will remind me of last year, when I went with my ex. Blarg. I don't want to think about him.

This thing needs a color change."

"event","Yesterday rocked. I felt LOVED :D This weekend I've been at the beach visiting my grandparents and checking out UC Santa Cruz. They live on a cliff overlooking the ocean, and its just a short path down to the sandy beach. My 19 year old cousin Scott was there too, so it was fun to hang out with him. He's a big surfer, so he was bummed that the surf was so flat. 

Anyways! I must tell you about the psycho pigeon. He was the coolest thing ever. So he landed on the deck and we saw he had two bands around his legs, showing he was tame. He was timid but wasn't scared of us at all, and started to peck at my cousin's surfboard. We fed him some birdseed, and eventually he just walked right in the house. LOL, he made a circle around the dinner table and then walked right back out. It was hilariously awesome. That pigeon was a total gangster.

I was able to get online last night, and it was really neat...I really connected with some people that I've kind of had a falling-out with lately. I just felt closer to everyone :)

That's about it for now. I do hope Russell is still alive, his house was bug-bombed last night and it was affecting his senses. >_>"

I'm a bit bummed though, because all my best friends are gone, and for a while today I thought my internet homies would be too. Colleen is in Canada, Annie is in the Philippines and well, I'm just here. So I'm left with kind of an empty feeling. And today would be the second time I've almost fried The Beast (aka my computer). Anyways.

I picked up my guitar today for the first time in forever. I really have no clue how to play, but it was still relaxing. I was so bored I played along with music vids on Fuse, and did quite an amusing rendition of My Band. XD

"event","Whee. So like, over a spanse of a few weeks, or whenever I last wrote in here, I've been thinking of all the little things I could write, just random things. But I never did so. And now I don't remember anything. So, I shall update on other boring things.

My best friend likes a guy that I kinda like, but I stopped liking him because she did. So now she's always talking about him, always thinking about him, always hanging out with him. And rawr, it sucks. I'm being ditched for a certain Kevin Lisk. 

And I'm getting a job soon. Translation: I shall never be home again. Oh well, it'll probably be good for my health. And anyways, it's not like that many people would care. That's the thing about friendships over the internet, they're very superficial.

You know...I realized something. I don't have any like, computer-playing friends. Other than Annie, but well...yeah. Ehem. So it always strikes me as weird when I see Tom or Brandon's journals and they're all like...spammed with comments and discussions about their lives. Now here's the real question: am I the pathetic one, or are they? Aw, I'm kidding. It's probably me. >_>

My french teacher needs to burn in hell. I'm seriously considering hiring a hitman. But then again I don't know any. Maybe I should find hitmen and make friends with them. I mean like...if you're friends with a hitman, he wouldn't kill you for any reason, even if hired to do so. Or he'd at least hesitate, giving you the opportunity to do some badass Alias move and get the hell out of there. And then that would give you an excuse to leave the city! And that would rock. Anyways, my french teacher needs to go back to her home: HELL. So if any of you know any hitmen, please let me know. 

Yay, it's a half day today. So I get out at around 11ish. I might go to Fun in the Sun, but then again...they say it might rain today. After that I'll probably go see Shrek 2, but I almost kind of don't want to. But I guess that's just the slightly lazy and antisocial side of me that doesn't want to spend money on anything other than gas. >_>

One last thought before I leave: why don't rich people ever spend their money on something cool? Like, okay if I was some rich famous rapper (LOL, wouldn't that be amazing?), I'd have hella fun with my money. Example: a pool of jello. How COOL would that be? Although...it couldn't be too deep, because you can't float in jello and you could drown. >_> That would be like..a really twisted way to die. Drowning in a pool of jello. Like, it seems like...a clown's perfect murder or something. It's all happy at first: yay jello! and then BAM, the clown pushes you in and you suffocate to death at the bottom of the pool. Wow, something is seriously wrong with me.

I must leave you now. Godspeed, and remember: save the pinatas."

The color of metal.
The material that stabs my heart.
The organ that you always seem to break.
It's not like it's your fault, but...
The greatest surgeon couldn't fill this empty hole.
It's not like I need you, but...
I just miss you:
My words never seem to hit their target.
It's not like I even know you...
But I love you.
And it's killing me.
So here's my heart, you can break it if you wish;
I'm tired of trying to keep it together.

And now after that weepy poem, I present to you the best lyrics ever:

Every day seems the same to me.
I sit around and think about how alone I feel,
Then I wind up rather enjoying loneliness, because it's the comfort of being sad-
Sometimes it feels so right.
And sometimes I'd like to be around no one for ten straight years.
But I know this feeling can't bring me places,
And I know I'm losing lots of ground.
But to keep up means to get up, and why does it have to be that
The world keeps on changing while I just stay the same? 
I feel like being sad doesn't mean enough to anyone anymore 
And I guess the world has made emotion obsolete. 
And I don't think I feel the same 'cause after all 
Who says what happy really means? 
Tonight I will redefine everything and tomorrow I will start in on my better days.
And so to each their own definition of happiness,
But no one ever reaches it so I don't think I'll breathe that way.
But happiness is when there's nowhere left to go,
Because in that state of mind there is no state of self.
So how was I supposed to know?

Saves the Day - Obsolete.


And now I'm going to go have fun. Because I'm sick of whining. Sorry to everyone that has had to put up with me over the last few days, I'm over it now. And 'anyone' who thinks I'm stupid because I speak my mind or talk about my emotions in my LJ can simply kiss my ass. XD"

Last Saturday, a bunch of my friends and I dressed up and rented a van to go down to SanFran, because we didn't have dates to prom >_>. So it starts HAILING as we drove down...and remember people, this is CALIFORNIA. Hailing is like, a miracle. It started building up on the windshield and almost looked like snow, soooooo cool. So after a ride full of crazyness (Silence is golden! water, water, water! LOL >_>) and because of traffic we didn't get there for awhile, and there was a three hour wait at the restaurant we went to. So we went shopping for a bit, and then we broke up into two groups. So Kayla, Colleen, Lindsey, Haley and I decided to go outside and wander the streets at night. We went to the Westin St. Francis hotel, this huuuuge fancy ass hotel with like a red-carpet entrance, and we went up the glass elevator. It was so incredibly gorgeous, seeing the city lit up at night like that. So we rode it up to the top floor where all the really nice named suites are, and we decided to try and find a window so we could look at the city more. We didn't see one, so we wanted to try to get on the roof. We found a stairwell and went up it, but the door at the top was locked. So instead we wrote our names on the wall and all that like some other people did. Haley and Lindsey went back to the elevator, but Colleen, Kayla and I saw that one of the suite doors was propped open. So we rang the doorbell and peeked our heads in, and there was just a concierge/bell boy guy in there watching Cops, so we asked if we could go in and look out the window. He said sure, so we got to do that for a bit XD Then we rode the elevator back down and when we were leaving I got ""wow""ed at by some guys outside :D It was fun LOL. My feet were killing me by the time we got back to the restaurant, but we ate and there was this REALLY gorgeous waiter..*sigh* My friend dared me to ask him to take a picture with us, but he never got close enough for me to ask =\ But overall, it was totally fun. And Colleen and I saw this guy who looked EXACTLY like Sark from Alias. Omg, it was so crazy..and he was really hot. >_>

Yesterday we had a bunch of X-gamers come to our school and set up a half-pipe and do their thing while they told us to drink milk and not smoke. It was...interesting. I'm like a hardcore Xgames fan, but I dunno, the whole thing was kind of boring and pointless. But hey, it beats class.

So I was thinking...and you know how 4/20 was two days ago...well how many people actually KNOW what 4/20 is? I mean I know it's turned into like some national pot-smoking day, but I just thought I'd educate you all on what 4/20 really is. It's Hitler's birthday. Yep. So now you know.

Oh! On a lighter note, Brad Pitt quit smoking!! How awesome is that! Yaaaay. He had to for Troy because he had to do a lot of running and was getting out of breath a lot. I'm so proud of him. He said he wanted to kill people while he was quitting, but it was good for his character. LOL, so yay.

You know, I was thinking today...how did it happen that we PAY companies to advertise for them? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Weird. Ooooooooooh...the <a href=""http://www.rk3de.com"">Rolex</a> is this weekend. Yay XD And the Kentucky Derby is in two weeks! Woot, I can't wait. Anyways, I've rambled on long enough. Later XD"

And I guess <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ilabb/"">you</a> are too. But not as much. :D

And all of you should know that driving by yourself is hella fun. I can just cruise along and enjoy some time just by myself and crank the music up loud and sing my heart out. No one to bother me or nag me....I can go as fast as I want and do 'California stops' and all that fun stuff. Oh the joys of driving, I might as well have fun with it while its new.

I just went on a four hour trail ride...and wow. I am a very sore and tired girl. It was amazing though, the horses weren't as spooky as usual. There was only one time where they all started freaking out and bolting, but it turned out alright. Good ol' Francis, he's so cute. My left foot is really exhuasted though, it almost gave out on me when I jumped off.

Well I'm being bothered to play RO. Adios amigos."

"event","Wow, what a night.

Yesterday around 6 I went over to Robyn's house with Colleen and Nicole, and there were a few other of our friends there and then Lindsey's boyfriend. I just have to say...he was fricking attractive (yay Nicoley lol). He was playing guitar the whole time and busted out with some Green Day...it was hawt. Tall, dark-haired, thin, nice arms, rockerish, knew how to play the guitar and was wearing a Harry Potter shirt that fitted just right (You know what I'm talkin about Gordy ;D) LOL so that was nice for awhile. Then Kayla, Nicole, Colleen and I went to Bel Air for some food.

In the El Camino.
The El Camino is black.
It has purple flames on the side.
The El Camino sits two people.
Colleen and I ride in the back.
Just think about it.

That car has crazy suspension. LOL it was so much fun. So we go, and we're about to park and I say to Colleen, ""Wouldn't it be funny if we saw Bostwick here?"" We look over, and he's leaving the parking lot right as we speak. Oh the madness.

So after we get food, Kayla tells us that all her cousins are outside and she doesn't want to get in trouble for having us in the back. So we're laying down flat as boards in the back of the El Camino. A really amusing sight, I'm telling you.

Time goes by, we watch a movie and eat and all that good stuff, and then we decide to go TP-ing. So all nine of us pile into Robyn's parents' van and start driving around the neighborhood trying to decide who to TP. We first wanted to do Wes's house (rawr Kayla ><), but he apparently ""didn't have suitable trees."" LOL so we go to John's...and spend like 40 seconds there before two people take off running, and the rest of us like totally freak out and start running after them. Apparently ""they saw a light turn on."" And my ankle like totally gives out and owie, it hurt for a few minutes. Sooo then we go to Ashley and Rachel's house and finally decide to do theirs. So we do a pretty sweet job, while avoiding one side of their house where there's a window that we can see them all sitting by. So when we're done I'm like ""You guys, lets go ring their doorbell and run."" So Colleen and Francesca decide to do it since they both have shoes on, and the rest of us pile into the (white) van. We peel out, I'm holding the side door open and they dive in right as they opened their door. LOL, it was so classic.

After that we headed back and decided to play Sardines in one of the courts. By then its like 11:30 or something. So we play that for awhile and then switch to hide-and-go-seek (in pairs of course, all of us girls are too afraid to hide at night all alone >_>) and Colleen and I go to the very end of the court and see this red truck. It's one of those small ones, like a Toyota Tacoma or something. So Colleen is like, ""Amy, lets go hide under the truck!"" So she squeezes under it first, and then I shimmy my way under it, and both our heads are like hitting the underside of the truck. And I like inhale dirt or something, seeing as I'm like on the ground in someone's driveway, and I coughed and Lisa starts laughing, because she's hiding behind the tree to the left. So Lisa and Lindsey are caught, and so are Kayla and the other Kayla. So it's Robyn, Elissa, Colleen and I still left. Meanwhile Francesca walks right past the truck and starts wandering over to the other side of the court. So Colleen and I are just chillin, under the car, trying to figure out what kind of truck it is. Finally we hear them yell that they've given up, so we crawl back out from under...and yeah we win XD

After that we all go inside and pile into the tents outside and talk and eat. There's two tents, but we all cram into one for awhile, and wow...okay it's like a 4-5 person tent...and we squeezed 9 of us in there. Good times...LOL. So yeah, then Colleen, Kayla and I went back to the other tent for sleeping at about 2:30ish. Kayla and I saw this weirdass thing in the sky, it was hecka days away but it looked like a UFO, LOL. It was like a bright star, but if you looked REALLY closely, you could see like flashing red and white lights. And it wasn't moving, but then it looked like it was spinning...or it'd move and then move right back. Then Kayla started seeing two of them, and I was like...okay I think we're tired and need to sleep. She and I were woken up twice during the night, once by a car alarm and the other by those fricking annoying crows and blue jays and magpie thingers. I hate those freaking birds. And now I'm home, because Colleen and I had to drive home early because she's got surgery today (getting her wisdom teeth pulled :( :()

Oh, but okay guess what I got yesterday.....*Drum roll please*

<b>MY LICENSE!</b> 

Yaaaaaay I'm happy. Wooot. Okay so anyways I've rambled on long enough. :D"

"event","Alright, I'm going to suck it up, quit whining and bitching about everything and actually have a non-depressed post that has NOTHING to do with RO. The fact that all the previous ones were makes me sound really pathetic and like I have no life. I do...just not every day. >_>

All of that will soon change though! Monday is the day of my license test, and god I'm scared out of my mind. I really really hope I pass. But yeah, once I get a car, which should be relatively soon, I may not be home as much! I shall finally be free. ALthough...ironically, things are going really well at home lately. My step-dad, I don't even know what's going on, but he's apparently become a new man. Like, even my mom said so...and wow. Example: the other day he called me up of his own accord and offered to stop and get food for me. That may seem trivial to most of you, but at that moment hell froze over. THe fact that my step-dad would even speak a word to me that didn't involve insults or yelling is just shocking, and then add on top of that the fact that he wanted to do something for me...I'm still just in shock. There hasn't been a fight in my house in a long time. And, for now, the hatred I have for him has temporarily subsided. Hey, if he wants to start over...the least I can do is give him a shot.

So the night before yesterday (Friday), I had a blast with my best friend and my mom, we had kind of a girls-night-out type of deal. At 4:30 I went to get my hair cut...and wow. Okay lets just say that I haven't gotten it cut in...a very long time. By that time it was down to like the lower-middle of my back when wet, and if I tilted my head all the way back it would reach my waist. And you don't really notice, but when you have hair that long (and thick like mine), it really weighs a lot. So I went in and had no idea what I really wanted done, so we talked it over with the lady and got some ideas. So she basically cut my hair to like...my bra strap, bottom of shoulder-blades area, and cut layers into it and the like, and then put like really thin blonde highlights all throughout it. The most amazing thing about it is that it's so flexible now..I can totally do what I want with it and it still looks good when I leave it curly (it becomes just kinda of wavy and tousled). I probably just bored you all to death, but that was mostly for Annie so that she could get an idea.

And now I'm stuck at my dad's house, bored out of my mind after finishing my book and my magazine. I can't wait until tomorrow afternoon...I'll hopefully be licensed and I'll have nothing to stress about for the rest of the week. Yay for spring break.

Peace out :D

(p.s. I got things worked out temporarily, so for now I won't be quitting. Thanks Nerm, Annie, Tom, Brandon and Dane. <3 you all)"

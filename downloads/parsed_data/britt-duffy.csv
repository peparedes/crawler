"event","Well this has had to be the most boring summer ive been through, at least last year i had friends i lived near so i could hang out. I know, i know, shut the fuck up duffy no one cares! I really feel like i could just disappear, and when school started again no one would notice I'm gone. I guess that kind of explains why i haven't been on AIM all summer, not like i talked to anyone before that. I wish my family had moved to florida like they have been saying, even more so after i admitted that i really wanted to. I guess it would be like a new start for me, ya know? Hell if anyone reads this it will be the first time someone outside of family has heard from me, unless you count that weird bulletin i sent out last week. I think that sophomore year changed me, wait, i know it did, but I'm trying to figure out if it was for the better or not. I'll admit my self esteem went up a little, but i started hanging out with other people less and less, and some of the people i did hang out with i really didnt like too much.

Also all my pillows are almost the same age as i am, ._. i finally am realizing just how much flat pillows fuck up your neck = lack of sleep = more thinking at night = tired cranky Duff = this LJ post."

"event","Well today was pretty cool, i stayed up till two again watching Hellsing, then dragged my arse upstairs to me bed and slept till like 9:00. Then mom woke me up and i went to get me hair cut. I love having my hair cut  XP and my mom and hair dresser person decided that im getting sent over her house* which is where she runs her hair buisness from* and being set out on the deck every day during summer break so i can tan. There trying to my my portugie blood come forth!. Ya so then later mah family and i went out to see Fever Pitch. If your a Sox fan go see it, i was on the edge of my seat during the small showings of the past games that sent our team home for the season ><. Also you get a pretty nice close up of Damon's arse. *baseball players and football players have the nicest asses*. On the way back Cae got all bitchy and started yelling at my dad for not bringing us bowling after, then i yelled at her, then mom yelled at me then at her then i yelled at my CD player for skipping again...it was a very fun ride home. After lunch my mom and i layed out in the sun. Oh ya i should be able to play Sweet Dreams in the next few days, i cant wait, i'll finally acomplish something on my guitar! X) the thought gives me this warm and tingly feeling inside...or maybe thats cuz im sitting on my legs o.o"

Always the center of attention, nobody can predict what you're going to do next. You love to have fun and often don't think of the consequences your actions can render. You're usually labeled the ""crazy one"" in the group and have a serious side (though seldom seen).
In the Manga: Haruko is an alien who came searching for someone like Naota. She carries around a kickin' bass and isn't afraid to do anything that sounds appealing at the moment. Full of spunk and life, this alien does have a complex nature she hardly ever shows."

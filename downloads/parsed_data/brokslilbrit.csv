"event","6 hours til 2004! 2003...what an awful year! 

Getting all A's once..going to a Kenny Chesney concert...having my first kiss/boyfriend...those were the good things that happened this year. 

there was just way to much bad..rather not think of it all right now..but next year will be different! 

just got back from getting my last white chocolate mocha espresso of the year from starbucks. mauahaha! Don't know about parties tonight..hell it's only 6..night is young..we'll see what happens! 

*cheers for a new 2004*"

Chris and Beth got me all these caffeine pills...and this drink like jolt i guess..it was pretty good...and Krista got me this hugeee tin of Snickerdoodles! :D and then this green m&m with alota mini's! ah a Julie, who wasn't there, got me a card with $30!! that was like wow..especially after everything that has happened..but wow..what a great bunch of friends i have!!

then Krista's mom arrived with Broccoli Cheese soup for us all! THEN! dominoes pizza arrived with 3 pizzas for all of us! ahh Chris ate the most, the fastest...he said he hadn't eaten all day..or was it for a few hours..hahaha well it was amusing. and then we also watched part of Malibu's most wanted. it was directed by the same people that did scary movie 3 so it was hilarious! then Beth had to go home..and Chris went with her..or no he went to get his car. then the rest of us ate the lovely marble cake they got us..had emo sprinkles and everything..Krista definitely picked this one out. ;) heh! but it was soooo good. :D and then we had sparkling grape juice. 

then Krista got really tired/sick all of a sudden...but we all wanted to go out..we were going to go to a show that Chris's friends went to at first..instead of ice skate...but Krista was so tired so me, Melissa and Krista tried some of those pills...they smelled so fucked up though. :x then we all went to Chris's and watched the european vma's and behind the music with britney spears with his little sister until he got out of the SHOWER! ah why did he shower anyways? Krista was pissed that we didn't really go anywhere..so she got really upset, so we said our goodbyes and all went home.

twas a great day. tomorrow will consist of english reading..unless i do it tonight, going to kinko's to print out copies of pictures..and math homework...unless Jessie calls me..that's what was going on earlier."

"event","Andy Rooney said on 60 minutes a few weeks back: (for those of you that don't know Andy Rooney, he is an 82 year old US TV commentator)
 
 
 
I don't think being a minority makes you a victim of anything except numbers. The only things I can think of that are truly discriminatory are things like the United Negro College Fund, Jet Magazine, Black Entertainment Television, and Miss Black America. Try to have things like the United Caucasian College Fund, Cloud Magazine, White Entertainment Television, or Miss White America; and see what happens. Jesse Jackson will be knocking down your door.
Guns do not make you a killer.  I think killing makes you a killer. You can kill someone with a baseball bat or a car, but no one is trying to ban you from driving to the ball game.

I believe they are called the Boy Scouts for a reason, that is why there are no girls allowed. Girls belong in the Girl Scouts!   ARE YOU LISTENING
MARTHA BURKE?

I think that if you feel homosexuality is wrong, it is not a phobia, it is an opinion.


I have the right ""NOT"" to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird, or tick me off.

When 70% of the people who get arrested are black, in cities where 70% of the population is black, that is not racial profiling, it is the Law of Probability.

I believe that if you are selling me a milk shake, a pack of cigarettes, a newspaper or a hotel room, you must do it in English! As a matter of fact, if you want to be an American citizen, you should have to speak English!

My father and grandfather didn't die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come over and disrespect ours. I think the police should have every right to shoot your sorry self if you threaten them
after they tell you to stop. If you can't understand the word ""freeze"" or ""stop"" in English, see the above lines.

I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you are qualified for any special loan programs, government sponsored bank loans or
tax breaks, etc., so you can open a hotel, coffee shop, trinket store, or any other business.

We did not go to the aid of certain foreign countries and risk our lives in wars to defend their freedoms, so that decades later they could come over here and tell us our constitution is a living document; and open to their
interpretations.

I don't hate the rich. I don't pity the poor. I know pro wrestling is fake, but so are movies and television. That doesn't stop you from watching them.

I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more.  If it ticks you off, go and invent the next operating system that's better, and put your name on the building.  Ask your buddy
that invented the Internet to help you. (Al)

It doesn't take a whole village to raise a child right, but it does take a parent to stand up to the kid; and smack their little behinds when necessary, and say ""NO!""

I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't pretend they are a political statement. And, please, stay home until that new lip ring heals. I don't want to look at your ugly infected mouth as you
serve me French fries!

I am sick of ""Political Correctness."" I know a lot of black people, and not a single one of them was born in Africa; so how can they be ""African-Americans""?  Besides, Africa is a continent. I don't go around saying I am a European-American because my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather was from Europe. I am proud to be from America and nowhere else."

"event","alright, this week was eventful..to say the least. i don't know what to think, but no one is dying so i guess im satisfied for the moment. saw Matrix Revolutions wendesday night @ 9:30pm..almost was sold out..lots of taylor kids..like four rows or so..seniors..i didn't know any of them..and then my english teacher and her husnband. 

here is my lovely review & i will basically tell everything that happens in the movie..so if you don't want to know..don't read. 
<lj-cut text=""So it's over.."">OK well, It was much better than Revolutions, IMO. but it did not top the Matrix. it opens right where it left off. I was confused on how Bane even got in the real world..but I watched reloaded again tonight and i caught a few things. of course Bane is Smith..unplugged..I guess he unplugged at the end of the matrix..but i didn't know they were played by different people..Ian...iforgethislastname did an excellent job of portraying Smith as Hugo does..if i couldn't even tell...i loved it when Bane said ""I knew he'd send his bitch down first."" or something like that. it was the first time i've heard him swear..i thought it was Hugo so it would have been a bigger deal. the train scene was just funny..the trainman was just fucked up..but having Neo in there and realizing he couldn't get out..it was funny..because i swear he has the biggest ego in the movie..but it's cool..i guess. after watching reloaded again i realized something about Sati..the little girl who had to be 'deleted'..when the Oracle and Neo are talking in reloaded..well..Sati and i guess the Twins from reloaded are the only ""programs"" i think that were deleted..or the Marovingeons body guards or whatever..they were useless programs also i believe..anywqays..the new oracle isn't the same..i just laughed at that scene...i can't believe the oracle from matrix and reloaded died in real life. that is sad. :( I loved Smith's scene in here!! Sati: I've heard you're a bad man. Smith: I'm not <i>so</i> bad once you get to know me! that was a great line..especially to the little kid! Smith was great in that scene..when he took over the oracle..that was kinda odd..i didn't understand what happened at first..again after i revisted reloaded tonight, i understood. the ""war"" with zion was ugh um so star wars like. it was boring to me. i don't like war scenese a lot..im not sure why..it just isn't appealing..it was so damn long..i know they were trying to make a point, but i got it, long before it was over. when Neo and Trinity went off in their own little ship and Neo fought with Bane..i loved it. it sucked Neo had to go blind, but the fact he could still see ..and in like this ultralight type of way was cool. after the fight is over, Trinity: Are you ok? Neo: I am, but you'll have to drive. I got a chuckle out of that. kinda sad Trinity had to die. Neo lost his eyesight, and now his girl..why go on living? i really did like the last scene. i wasn't thrilled with Smith's last words becasue as someone said somewhere else it was so unsmith like. and when Neo punched Smith and his face slowly caved in..was that supposed to be funny? it wasn't to me. it was kinda lame/but cool when Neo was talking to the ""master machine"" that reminded me a lot of the architect. was that his voice? were they the same person? i don't think so. the ending was confusing when i first saw it, but <lj user=""geekydork""> explained it well to me. Neo sacraficed himself for the rest of mankind. i didn't think he actually died..but apparently he did. peace was made between the machines and the humans temporarily, and then when they start fighting again, the cycle will repeat itself. so it was kind of depressing to think about that but overall the movie was good. i need to see it in the imax version and i also need to take my friends to see it. </lj-cut>"

"event","In the darkest hours of the night
I've lain in silence, crying;
Tired of all the pain I've suffered,
Sick and tired of trying.
Alone, I lay in tearful silence
As I have lain for so long
And then you whisper in my ear
To have hope, though I've been wronged.

Alienated, I've become
With a great fear of tomorrow.
I can't help but glance over my shoulder
Or hide away, alone, in sorrow.
I feel the darkness press around me
I scream against this deepening hell
Until I hear you say you love me
With a voice I know so well.

I see a stranger in a friend,
An enemy admidst a love.
I cannot understand this weight
That presses down from above
So angry - hateful - I've become
Over things I can't define
Until you come to hold me
To help me heal in time.

I know that there are many things
Which I cannot grasp
One thing being how I'd lost
A friendship I'd hoped would last.
I simply do not understand
Why I suffer so much pain,
But every time I hurt so much,
You there to comfort me again.

We have been through many things,
From 9/11 to losing friends,
From being there for one another
To facing many tragic ends.
We've gazed and wished upon many a star
As under the clear night sky we'd lay
And we promised one another to always be there
For each other, for love - and come what may."

I didn't think i'd have to worry
About the anxious yearnings
That were gonna come

Yet here I sit again
Same old way I have before
Here I am in my hole again
Waiting not to be a wretch
Not to be such a wretch

It's slipped through my hands before
And I'm afraid of pushing you away
I wish I could stop thinking of you sometimes
God I wish you would just stay
To calm this pain inside of me
This heart that bleeds on its own

I'm so tired of being here.
Suppressed by all my childhood fears.
And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave.
Cause your presence still lingers here, and it won't leave me alone.
These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real, there's just too much that time cannot erase.
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears, when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears.
I held your hand through all of these years.
But you still have...
All of me.
You used to captivate me by your resonating mind, now I'm bound by the life you left behind.
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams; your voice has chased away all the sanity in me.
These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real, there's just too much that time cannot erase.
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears,When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears.
I held your hand through all of these years.
But you still have...
All of me.
I tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone.
But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along.
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears, when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears.
I held your hand through all of these years.

"event","once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
and she wrote a poem
and she called it ""mittens""
because that was the name of her cat
and thats what it was all about
and her teacher gave her a gold star
and he grandmother hung it on the refrigerator door
and read it to her mother on the phone in chicago
that was the year she got her communion
and fell asleep on the birthday cake.
She got a letter signed from daddy with a row of x's ans o's
And she had to ask her grandmother what they meant
And her grandmother let her sleep in her bed at night
and was always there to do it.


Once on a white piece of paper with blue lines
She wrote a poem
And she called it ""Winter""
Because that was the name of the season
and thats what it was all about
And her teacher gave her an A
And told her to write more clearly
And her grandmother hung it on the kitchen door
But it left with her grandmother
When she flew south that winter
And her grandmother didnt come back
When her mother moved in with her sister
That was the year her sisters father went to prison
And went on trips to see him every month
Yet she didnt see her own father
Who was in the prison 10 minutes away.
And her mother never tucked her in bed at night
And was never there to do it.

One on a piece of paper torn from her notebook
She tried another poem
And called it ""December""
Because thats when her birthday was
When shed move in with her love
And thats what it was all about
And her teacher gave her an A
And a strange look
And her grandmother never hung it on the refrigerator
Because she never showed her
That was the year she flew south for the summer
And moved in with her grandmother
Who let her see her boyfriend
And hid it from her mother
Because she loved him more than life
And loved to live a life with him.
And her grandmother said goodnight
Turned off the light
And was always there to do it

One night she cried on the phone
And begged to have the mouse for the computer
So she could retype this poem
And this is what she said:

That's why on the back of his sweater she wrote another poem
And she called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
Because thats what it was really all about
And she gave herself an A
And a slash on eached scarred wrist
And hung it on the bathroom door
Because this time she didnt think she could reach the kitchen"

"event","jeez there were like no trick or treaters at all..maybe 10 groups in all..i went to Julie's tonight. we were supposed to go to fright fest so yeah..we got there at 3:30 just to find out it wouldn't even open until 6..and it closes at midnight. so we are going tomorrow instead. 10am-6pm! so we just came and hung out with the baby for awhile until it was time to figure out our plans for the evening. we ended up getting the coffin Julie's dad made a fews years back out..and made it look like i was dead..by like yeah putting ""blood"" all over my face..damn im so pale already...but anyways i just sat there and stared at kids...or layed down until someone touched me then i'd yell. scared a few kids. i guess that was good considering the oldest person that came was like 9. but ok there were a few carnivals going on tonight too..so that's where all the customers went i suppose. Julie's street is already so ghetto anyways. 

could anyone tell i spray painted some of my hair white today? Julie couldn't and neither could her family..i thought i did a good job with it. i had pigtails spray painted white and i wore a shirt that said 'no really, this is my costume.' inspired by me, and made by my sister. she liked the idea so much she copied it for herself. there were lots of good costumes..Paul McCartney, Bride of frankenstein, village people..tons of skimpy police gals..they got in trouble..some fake asians..that was funny..i took a lot of pictures..guess who was not dressed up at all..yes Tae! i still took at least 2 pictures of him. couldn't make it look to obvious so they probably aren't too good but we shall see."

Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Something has been taken from deep inside of me
The secret I've kept locked away no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head for years and years they've played

(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would)
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would)
(If I could take all the shame to the grave I would)
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would)
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would)
(I would take all my shame to the grave)

[Chorus]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something more
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would)
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would)
(If I could take all the shame to the grave I would)
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would)
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would)
(I would take all my shame to the grave)

Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
It's so much simpler than change

[Chorus]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something more
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

It's easier to run
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)
(Retrace every wrong move that I made)
It's easier to go
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)

we had a simulation at school too. like you know..people ""die"" they paint their faces and can't talk to anyone for two school days. it was cool. they are isolated completely except they eat lunch w/the other dead people..people thougt it was funny to keep saying ""i see dead people"" it was just stupid after awhile. 

I got a 100 on my math test! boo yah! I thought i missed the last six completely..but she said since barely anyone finished on time..she weighed the points differently. that is pretty cool..i have't got a 100 on a math test for a few years now.

in webmastering since the district screwed up and first the servers were slow and today we couldn't even get on our h drives..so yeah the whole project we were working on the entire six weeks coudln't be graded..so we only have like five grades for this six weeks in there. hopefully it'll be an A. 

i was thinking im doing pretty good in all my classe. tomororw is a half day. me and Julie are supposed to go to fright fest at astroworld instead of trick or treating..haha it'll be soo much fun if it works out! and then tonight is the orchestra masquerade ball....im going as what i was last year..the court jester..but im not being that tomorrow so it'll work out. oh and tomorrow i have to bring a camera. hopefully nothing will go wrong for the next few weeks. haha watch i jynx myself when i say that."

"event","Hurt Feelings Truly Hurt
Snub or Sting, Brain Feels the Same Pain
By Daniel DeNoon

Oct. 10, 2003 -- The pain of hurt feelings is as real as the pain of physical injury, new brain studies show.

The findings appear in the Oct. 10 issue of the journal Science. UCLA researcher Matthew D. Lieberman, PhD, used real-time brain scans to map brain activity in people feeling social distress.

The findings: The areas of the brain that light up when a person feels physical pain also light up when a person's feelings are hurt.

""We use physical metaphors to describe social pain like 'a broken heart' or 'hurt feelings,'"" Lieberman says in a news release. ""Now we see that there is a good reason for this.""

The Pain of Monkey-in-the-Middle

Remarkably, the experiment by Lieberman and co-workers Naomi I. Eisenberger and Kipling D. Williams, PhD, didn't hurt the 13 student volunteers very much.

Encased in an MRI brain-scanning machine, the students played a simple video game. They were one of three players tossing a virtual ball to one another. At first, the students had to watch as the other two players tossed the ball. Then their controls became active, and they played for awhile. But soon the two other players -- computerized stooges, really -- played only with each other. As the students realized they were being left out, it hurt.

This made the area associated with pain light up. The more activity in a student's pain area, the more painful the student rated the experience.

""We can say being excluded doesn't matter, but rejection of any form still appears to register automatically in the brain,"" Lieberman says.

The Healing Power of Language

But the pain area wasn't the only part of the brain to become active. Being left out also activated an area associated with language and the regulation of emotion. Students with more activity in this area reported less pain.

""Verbalizing distress may partly shut down the areas of the brain that register distress,"" Lieberman says. ""The regulating abilities of the prefrontal cortex may be why therapy and expressing painful feelings in poems and diaries is therapeutic.""

Humans Are Social Animals

Why did the human brain evolve to feel emotional pain? In this we aren't alone. Social loss triggers distress signals in the brains of other animals whose survival depends on social bonds, notes an accompanying editorial by Jaak Panksepp, PhD. Panksepp is a researcher at Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio, and Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill.

""Psychological pain in humans, especially grief and intense loneliness, may share some of the same neural pathways that elaborate physical pain,"" Panksepp writes.

The reason appears to be survival. Emotional pain hurts. We move closer to others to relieve the pain. Over millions of years, we've evolved this to a fine art.

""These findings show how deeply rooted our need is for social connection,"" Eisenberger says in a news release. ""There's something about exclusion from others that is perceived as being as harmful to our survival as something that can physically hurt us, and our body automatically knows this.""

Love Conquers Pain

If all this is true -- and more study is needed -- it stands to reason that love might be an antidote.

""Throughout history, poets have written about the pain of a broken heart. It seems that such poetic insights into the human condition are now supported by neurophysiological findings,"" Panksepp notes. ""Will the opposite also prove to be the case -- that socially supportive and loving feelings reduce the sting of pain? A reasonable working hypothesis is that social feelings such as love are constructed from brain neural circuits that alleviate the feelings of social isolation."""

I had a dream I failed the critical thinking English test last night, and what did i get? a 91! i do so well when i cram. well ok maybe not. but i had no idea what romanticism was until i read the 10 pages of it in the book when we were supposed to have already i guess. i don't know about her..the teacher, I mean. she doesn't seem like she grades anything on content. Krista thinks it's true also. we had a vocab quiz she never prepared us for so we had 9 bonus questions i know i got right..and i know i got the whole thing right. so good for me.

didn't make the bowling team. bah i knew i wouldn't. i don't have time for that anyways. i'll just practice up real good and maybe make varsity next year.

"event","anyone like to agree with me? that is me & Krista's new theory! and it's only the second six weeks...already...it's like what..being a junior in high school means crying every day..and sleeping throughout classes because you're to busy stressing at night? i'd say that's a fairly accurate description. so whatever...I did make a <b>92</b> on the last chemistry test so i am not complaining much, but the homework..last night I think i spent an hour and a half on it and i didn't even do it right..so today i copied Krista's stuff in english cuz she did it right. then we both did what she didn't at lunch. oh and i didn't finish reading the story we were supposed to either for english..hopefully she doesn't give us a pop quiz tomorrow. :/ it's Edgar Allan Poe, cool writer, just listening to someones horribly dull voice drone on and on for 45 minutes puts you to sleep. so what was the one class i didn't fall asleep in, study hall! how ironic!!! i was doing my fucking themistry the entire time! and this was like 8 problems, mind you. *rips hair out*

oh and happy mole day. a mole is a unit of measurement. 6.02x10 23rd! we were supposed to have a quiz while every other class really did have a party. yeah, not fair, right? Julie brought cupcakes! but!! the quiz was <strike>cancelled!</strike> ..it wasn't on the board when we walked in but teachers in high school like to often times the last 10 minutes of class say ""ok, take out a piece of paper and you have until the bell to finish."" ....but NO! thank God! no quiz! oh well..hopefully it will not be tomorrow either. 

Tae looked nice. that was the only nice part of the day besdies chemistry. i've been unbelievably tired this week..falling asleep in every class.

did anyone hear about the asian girl that goes to mcmeans that brought an asian pencil sharpener in and she got suspended, kicked off being president of student concil, and kicked out of nhs! talk about gawdawful! but...my uncle wishes she had gotten put in OAC (A school) because it really looked like a boxcutter. Martina <lj user=""bartinigirl03""> saw it on the news in Ohio so maybe it was on in other places. anyways...she was from Korea..i guess the Koreans normally have boxcutters out..this is America!

oh and i got my class ring order put in today. Christine <lj user=""popsixchicken""> got hers for what....$140-something? guess how much i paid for mine? $467! eeks!! i got the classic one..with nothing special on it but it's 14kt. gold because I'm allergic to the other kinds. the only other option was 18kt. gold and it wasn't on there. i figure I'm going to wear it senior year and end up pawning it when I'm in college.

<lj-cut text=""Hundreds Of Students Out Sick With Flu"">

Flu Shots Set For Next Week

POSTED: 5:16 p.m. CDT October 15, 2003
UPDATED: 5:44 p.m. CDT October 15, 2003

HOUSTON -- Hundreds of high school students missed classes Wednesday after they came down with flu-like symptoms, officials told News2Houston. 
Video 
 
 
Students Miss Class From Illness   
 
 
 
 

Approximately 359 students did not attend school at James E. Taylor High School, 20700 Kingsland Blvd., which is 15 percent of the student body. 

The school is in the Katy Independent School District.  

""There doesn't seem to be that trend right now at the junior highs and elementary schools that feed into Taylor. It looks like, right now, it's hitting our older students,"" said Chris Taylor, with Katy ISD. ""Most parents are reporting very flu-like symptoms of the upper-respiratory, the aching, the fever, so we know that not every absence may be attributable to flu, but it's a very high incidence."" 

Students said that nearly every class had at least one absence and some as many as five. 

""A whole lot of people have been really sick and everything,"" said Michael Renfrow, a sophomore. ""We're in a record label called Five Crowns and there's about 17 of us and about seven of us were at school today, so a whole lot of people were sick. I'm hoping I don't get it because even my teachers are sick right now."" 

School rules dictate that students and teachers must not have a high temperature before returning to class. 

The number of absences was alarming because one week earlier, the school reported 50 absences due to flu-like symptoms for the entire week, according to officials. 

The school is scheduled to receive flu shots on Oct. 24. 

Flu symptoms include the following. 
Sore throat 
Head, body aches 
Fever 
Fatigue 
Dry, hacking cough 
</lj-cut>

of course you wonder why. everyone is coming to school..even when they are sick. no one wants to lose their exemptions. whatever. stupid school is only hurting itself!"

"event","first of all, I got to school at 6:30am almost because I thought the library opened up sooner than 7am! but I didn't have that much time...I was printing thru the bell..luckily I got a pass and I wasn't tardy. well tomorrow is the homecoming dance, today was the game. it was *so* annoying at school! listening to everyones mum's and garters jingle! I swore if I heard one more jingle by the end of the day I was going to hurt someone! 

I had an english quiz that was easy, the math quiz was alright, and the chemistry quiz I'm pretty sure I did alright on..except maybe I missed a few charges..but not that many..I still did well. 

I saw Tae before third period when I was dropping off my candy money...and he was wearing his garter! *tear* I'm glad I didn't see Mentra..*sigh* whatever..it's stupid. 


Mums/Garters w/ bells on it are stupid because:
1. they are huge
2. they are heavy
3. mums are so damn expensive
4. they are annoying
5. they make you sound like cows.

so yeah..even if I was going w/ Kris or anyone..I wouldn't make them buy me a mum because that's such a waste. anyways. I went and got my hair frosted tonight! wahoo! then went to Jack N' the Box w/ dad. fun times."

I have A's in Art & History..a B in english..hopefully w/ extra credit it will become an A..and I am passing chemistry..with a 71. our class did the worst. only 1 A..probably Tae or Maas. and 3 people failed and I am not one of them! so happy! I really hope I'm catching onto all of this metric conversion stuff now..demensional analysis isn't too bad..just have to remember what you want out of it.

i got a 90 on the art quiz i didn't study for, a 106 on the history test i did not study for..bsides doing the review...and a 92 on the math test i did not study for..really. but then i got a 40 on the first conversion quiz, Tae n Maas broke the curve, getting 98 and 100...it's kind of sad they get better grades then the people that were born here. then i only got a 50 on the retake so i'm sure that didn't help me too much...but i think i am finally getting the new adding n subtracting exponents method. God I hope I am. it wasn't that bad of a week. offically joined TMC. gotta work after school tues and thurs on the homecoming wall! I can't forget...but mmmmm I know the 2nd is Nick's birthday *my old Nick* and well..I'll remember. today was a half day. but yet the day seemed so long.

it was our movie madness pep rally today. this morning we saw alot. the three musketeers entering together..Jay & Silent Bob (Kyle was Bob)..and a bunch of other things no one could quite figure out w/o asking. 

we're making websites, finally! ugh and Leon, I think there's something wrong w/ him. he does not know how to be quiet..and he's so um stupid. :/ not to be mean, but the truth hurts. I always have to tell him to shut up under my breath..i know he doesn't hear me. 

in english we are watching the crucible. we have to write an one page essay about two differences between the movie and the book. due  monday! no dammit i already have enough fucking english for 48 hours! but whatever..i don't even know..are we supposed to type EVERYTHING out? even the first dialectal entry, and all our ""creative"" writing too? ugh i don't have enough ink to do all this shit..or enough patience to deal w/ stupid computers! i really hope she extends the deadline on something..im so not up for doing all this this weekend.

then it was study hall, time to sleep and wake up and freak out b/c for some reason, i can't sleep w/ mascara on and not get my eyes all blurry when i wake up! grr at least it doesn't give me racoon eyes so much anymore.

me and Krista got pep rally tickets, then i got a cherry coke & cookies. <lj user=""sockhop""> I really hope you are feeling better today, Jess! i wondered why you were so quiet yesterday. Krista is so sick, but yet she doesn't want to stay home bc then she'll lose her exemptions. who could blame her! that is where our school is soo messed up. it's like, we aren't the stupid drug addicts that ditch every other day. if i get sick, no way am i staying home b/c im not losing my exemptions. i mean, the ""exemption/sickness"" rule was put in act to discourage people ditching school, but what about the good kids who just get sick? they are going to go to school anyways and spread their germs to everyone else! not smart on the school administrators part! ;) 

history we watched this movie on Andrew Carnigie. i did not fall asleep during a history video! I'm amazed! haha Kyle came in, i had no idea it was him..had to get a good look! he had a good costume.

in art we finished drawing our hand holding something, i held a pencil. i actually like my hand drawings. they don't look quite as shitty as everything else i draw! some kids are so much more better than mine, but why compare myself to others? I'm good, that's all that matters. we got to grade it too, i gave myself a 92 just b/c i know i can do better. and we had to copy down vocab, didn't get it all so it'll wait til monday.

math we took the 4 problem quiz, almost positive i aced it. but i really don't want to say that. hopefully she graded it already. we're doing word problems....those aren't bad. some girls mom died two days ago. that has to suck. i can't even imagine living if that happened. and i think she was a freshman. 

chemistry we did another lab. today it was measuring liquids! woohoo i got a 100 on the lab i did yesterday, the only 100 i have in that class. to bad labs don't count for more! I work w/ Chris n Vinny. Not w/ Tae. :( ohhh Tae was wearing a t-shirt today! haha normally he wears these cute button striped shirts but today it was different!! awww!!! &hearts;

then we left for the pep rally. me and Krista went together and met up w/ Christine and some other girl that sits at our table...who knows her name..and we actually got their early so we sat up top. it was nice. first Corey Hopkins? i think he sang the national anthem! Krista is right, he's a great singer. also first they played a clip of ""where were you (when the world stopped turning)"" by alan jackson, in light of 9/11..that was nice. and two girls got asked to homecoming there!! awwww it was sooo sweet! i wish my guy was someone that'd do that kind of thing, but oh yeah i need a guy first! :b bah! homecoming in oct. 11 and im not going unless im asked. since it was movie day..the mascot was dressed like madonna..cute. then they did skits. first the ompalompas came out. that was great...the best one was Austin Powers, Dr. Evil,and Mini-me! that was hilarious! Krista knew mini-me, too! then they did Grease and that was pretty much it. school got out at 2:40 so they were running behind. but it was a good show.


this has been the slowest day in the world, especially since the schedules were speeded up! ugh glad it's over. now i just have english,english,english, and chemistry for homework! joy! i think everyone knows what I'll be doing this weekend."

chemistry is just ugh!! i need to perfect the art of significant figures, and using the metric system..i mean..remembering to use significant figures. we start labs tomorrow. i got a 74% on the quiz. yay i passed when alot of others, did not. Tae got like an 87%!! hehe! Krista got like a 76% or something..but it doesn't matter what anyone else got..but i bet Tae would be a good tutor. errr haha i wish i could actually talk to him...oh well...i'd rather just look at him. 

me and Julie are talking again. i've only talked to her like 3 times since friday..but uhm..yeah..Michelle needs help and evidentally the safety net did not work. but um Julie is NOT obligated to help her..she's just brining her down w/ her..and that's not right.

sigh and now the day is over. tomorrow the same old cycle. someone get me outta here!  it has only been 5 weeks!"

"event","i needed to sleep til noon today. i am sick. who gave me their damn cold! i feel like i could pass out right now. i ate more than i have ever eaten in one day today i think. um lets see; jack n the box, chili's, starbucks, and then um johnny carinos for dinner. 


anyways..Jessie picked me up. went to the record store on mason. saw a Kenny Cd i did not have. but i did not buy b/c i am cheap. then we went to ci-ci's, decided they weren't good enough for us, and left. then went to Chili's where we talked and talked about how evil michelle is and how we are going to get Julie back. we WILL win! i got nachos and the waiter we had liked my shirt..he's like ""well since im a man i guess it doesn't apply to me."" i wore my 'boys are stupid, throw rocks at them.' so then she took me home. and about an hour later we walked to starbucks. i showed her the infamous convo b/t me and michelle. funny stuff. got a mocha malt frap. 

then i came home and went to johnny carinos w/ my parents where i got italian nachos and an italian creme soda. and the waiter hit on me. quite a few times. asked me if i wanted a drink, but my parents were sitting right there, haha he asked my mom for ID getting wine, though! it was funny! then he wanted to share my nachos...but he said that since i was good looking i'd have lots of other guys that'd beat him up..lol and my parents were there so um yeah. the waiter wasn't that bad either. that was a first. 


i hope im making sense..i think ill just do homework tomorrow...math..bah! ah smirnoff is good stuff! :D"

"event","so i guess i ""told Michelle off"" today..or that's what Krista is telling everyone now. it's like me and Julie always meet after 6th period and Krista was there too today and michelle comes up and is really annoying so i give her a look and she's like ""do you hate me or something?"" something like that..and so she asked!! oh my gosh so im like ""you're annoying."" and so she just walks off...hahahahaha!! ok now i don't lie to people..what was i supposed to say..i mean..i told the truth...she should be sorry she asked.

so after school i walk up and tap her on the back and she totally blows me off and me and Julie are walking and talking of course and all..it's quite funny..after i leave she gave Julie a note and it's all ""oh i hate Britta! can you believe she said that?"" and Julie is of course sticking up for me saying ""well of course you asked.."" and ok what the fuck...at least i didn't say my TRUE OPINION of her..that she's FUCKING PYSCHOTIC! i mean geez..if you ask someone their opinion of you..then it is your fault if they say something you don't wanna hear...and lying is so horrible so im not going to do that. so of course now michelle wants to hurt me. and my God she could hurt me..she weighs 225 pounds which is outweighing me twice..not only does she eat and eat and eat obsessively but she also is obsessed w/ working out..so yeah...this is getting big..michelle is such a revengeful/spiteful/jealous/manipulative person...she needs to be locked up...and the key needs to be thrown away. i guess im kind of scared..but at least i know what she is thinking..if i am home alone i won't open my door for her. and please if she *ever* really hurt me, she'd be dead. end of story. and no one would know how she died. she'd just disappear..oh yes it's great having people that love you and are willing to defend you.


oh and that person that was harrassing me online..sexieness06 or something..that's michelle before i knew her in person. i wonder if i printed out the convos..what a big idiot she'd look like..or if she'd even admit it."

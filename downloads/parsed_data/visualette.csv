Posted On: 01/06/2008 14:21:47  

Wow its over, Okay so I was hoping to give a full con report or something like that but it isnt going to happen. Too much happened and this was probably the best con ever. I made more friends that I'll actually keep in contacts with! Wow! (laugh)

(TwT) Miku, Cloe and Tatsu are the new friends I hung out with the most we all stayed up all night last night except Tatsu who went to a party the bastard. 

Also I met Sarsar who I've know for 5+ years and have never met it was pretty amazing! 

Because I cosplayed such unknown things I was pleased when someone recognized me as Aki, not because they dont know Aki but it was a REALLY old outfit, and I was even more pleased when 10+ people (you know out of like.... 5000 or something) Knew who I was when I was DJ Ozma and as I thought, I was asked if I was cosplaying An Cafe. It couldnt be avoided. 


Posted On: 01/06/2008 18:32:57  

Okay I really wanna go to acen now. I wasnt going to go but If I have the money I'm going to have to (;_;) Everyone will be there! Wah! Okay so I doubt I'll be attending Anime Punch if I go to acen. So, Now, the problem is deciding cosplay. I've wanted to cosplay a member of An Cafe but I dont know if I could really pull it off but I think I'll try Kanon because Miku chan thinks I can do it and that motivates me because Kanon is one of my reasons for life (laugh) Boy is made of win! So now to decide on which costume. Then what I'll wear the other days at the con! Wah! and if I end up not going I'll have costumes for another con so it's all good.

So now I have to decide on other costumes but I'm not sure what. Any suggestions? (laugh)"

So wow. My shows are tomorrow and friday. 
At 7 pm.

I'm not nervous. I live for this.
My nails are growing back. They might be gone tomorrow
Horrible habit of chewing them.

I cant though. I cant chew food. 

Today is my last day of seeing daylight until saturday.
It makes me feel a little melancholy.
Currently theres a lot I need to say to people but no words that want to come.


But I dont mind. My current concern is selling tickets.
If I dont sell 155 tickets tomorrow there will be no spring play. 
I wont play a lead and This will end up being my last show.
Its really depressing.
I live to be the center of attention and I'll admit it.

So I'll be dressing in kodona, I'm still not sure if we'll wear costumes for the short.

Maybe I can pass it off as a Halloween costumes and no one will stare at me weird for wearing kodona to school. Who knows.

Other than the fact that I've turned the most lovely shade of green

I have more important matters to speak of

It seems as though all my life I've known exactly what I wanted to do
and where I wanted to go with my life.

But now that the time has come I can't make the decisions I need to
I can't be the person I want to be, or wanted to be, or need to be, or should be
I don't want these decisions to be approaching but they are coming
I'm trying hard not to think about college but at the same time
I am trying to think very hard about where I'll go and what I'll do
I'm trying to think of how to get great grades to get a scholarship but
I'm really just trying to get good enough grades to graduate.
Why do they do this to seniors?

I wish I could go back before anything and be clueless and oblivious to these 
life eating decisions.
I want to be before college was so close I can read the rejection letters before they arrive.
I dont want to grow up and make these decisions and take these tests
and fail at passing these obstacles.

Life is weighing on me and I used to laugh at people who would take things like this so seriously. Now I am one of the people I used to laugh at.
Do I want to reach for the stars? Or do I want to do what I am quiet sure I can. 
Should I challenge myself just to be rejected or should I attempt in case I succeed.
Maybe its success I fear. 

I'm not sure If I'm good at anything.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Except, Crack under pressure.

Sorry about today."

Manda told me to stop centering things.
But I wont. (laughs)

I went to the bonfire at my school.
Catherine was there! 
It's so awesome to see my friends.

I skipped school today,
well not all of it.
But I left at lunch and didn't go back.

Andrew bought me a pen that reminds me of Gackt.
It's a sword with a bleeding heart on it (laughs)
Gackt or Mana pen. It's sugoi.

I can not wait to get all dressed up tomorrow
for homecomming.
(TwT) dress and everything.

James and Tess ate lunch with us today!

Instead of school we went to Waterbeds and stuff

I know someone who needs those.

Then we went to a pet store!

Rather embarassing.

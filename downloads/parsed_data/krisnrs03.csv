"event","i moved half of my stuff into my apartment yestarday... and i met my roommate for the first time... and i signed my first lease. all very exciting and stressful and sad. im gonna miss my girls...we were all crying on thursday.  i came back today to get more stuff and saw them again (i wasnt anticipating on coming back at all).  it feels like this day came to quickly..i didnt get to say my ""cya laters"" to everyone.  i do really like the idea of being on my own and not having to deal with the shit thats goin on.  the day i turned 20 is the day my life/world flipped upside down and i finally see a little glimmer of light...a little happiness perhaps?  i hope so."

The Lilith Magazine is finally out.  It's nice to have something that shows how much hard work I put into it.  It was also nice to have both of my parents supporting me in this, and not just my dad.  We had a party today and both of my parents showed up, i brought michael, and my mom brought paige emma and aimee.  I cant remember the last time i felt supported by my mom. 

on a not so happy note:

It feels like all of the walls around me are crumbling and if i dont stay stong, everythign will crumble.  im so sorry to all of my friends and family. im sorry for being angry all the time and snapping at everyone. anything anyone says makes me cry.  u guys know that i dont cry in front of anyone...until recently.  i just really hope everything will be ok...it will. it has to be."

i dont know if this is good or bad.  i might just be reaching for the past, but on march 6th i think im gonna go to a twirling competition...as supporter not a competitor, which i have never done before.  it will be the first time seeing everything and everyone since i had to quit 2 years ago...

i regret quiting sometimes.  i miss it.  its too late to go back as a competitor...maybe as a coach. i can't believe i'm saying this but i'm too old to compete. but i'll see how everything is when i get there on march. ill talk to people and see whats up. 

i want amanda to come with me. i think she will want to.  im gonna ask her tomorrow. or maybe ill leave her a message in her ""myspace"".

Enter 
A decade ago
Exit
A month ago

from 4th grade
lunch to 
8th grade
semiformal
It said 
friends forever

from 9th grade
issues to
10th grade
rejoice
It said
Friends forever

from 11th grade
confusion to 
March's
junior prom
It said friends forever

from 12th grade
exploration to
May's
senior trip
It said
friends forever

from prom night 
drama
to graduation day
emotions
it said 
friends forever

from college freshman year
lost
to sophmore year 
found
it said
friends forever

from 4th of July
fun
to house sitting
party
it said 
friends forever 

from the road trip
with wexler
to that last night
that final fight
it still said
friends forever

from that last silence
until forever
they memory
will always say
friends forever


Together (unofficial title)

after all we dealt with
and all we went through
I never thought this fight
would kill the love
I thought we shared


Did you use me? (unofficial title)

I loved you
I thought you did too
I was wrong

I gave you money
I drove you anywhere
Did you use me?

I gave you advice
I got you a job
Did you use me?

I gave you a shoulder
I let you cry
Did you use me?

I loved you
I thought you did too
Did you use me?


Over you

Although I'm not over it
I am trying
No one will replace
the person I thought you were

I'm stronger now
I told you how I felt
You ripped my heart out
And broke it into a million pieces

Only 500,000 more to go
Until it is back together
I thought talking to you would help
But you laughed at me

I can do it myself
I don't need you
I just realized that
You are nothing

I want the fairytale
You're not prince charming
You did me a favor though
You ruined us when I should have

So good luck in life
I wish you the best
Forget our future plans 
I'll get what I really want

I'm over the person you are today
It may take time
But I will be
Over the person I thought you were



I'm not much of a writer.  These are just some rough thoughts.  Any constructive criticism is welcome.  I'm just tired of being predictable and putting some pop song on here to describe how I feel.  They never seem to be exact anyway."

"event","""Breakaway""

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I just stared out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

Trying hard to reach out
But when I'd try to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray (I would pray)
I could breakaway

[Chorus:]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
I'll make a wish 
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I'll take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

[Chorus]

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway"

I just assumed any spot would be the same.  I need to think.  I need to research. I think i changed my mind again.  Back to square one."

"event","Wow, I&nbsp;know. Shocking. Dazzling. Not even imaginable. Beyond the grasp of understanding. 

But true. 

I'm actually writing something on here. After a million years&nbsp;of hibernation in space I have arisen from the depths of the real world and come to report my findings. 

In short, life has been pretty good. I've been like quite happy lately. Maybe it's because summer's coming or maybe it's because I have like the greatest friends in the known universe. Either way I'm cheerful. I&nbsp;don't even really mind that I&nbsp;have a digestion test tomorrow.&nbsp;I&nbsp;think that everything will be fun and fine. 

Pig dissection was one of the most interesting things I've done before. I&nbsp;really enjoyed myself while being respectful to my darling piggie Russel Crow. I'm going to take biology now because it was just such an interesting experience. Meredith and George were some of the best dissection group people I could've ever had. It was a good experience. 

Tomorrow I&nbsp;have a piano recital which I'm a little nervous for but once I&nbsp;finish that I&nbsp;get to party at music banquet which will be a joyous occasion. It's also Man Hug Day tomorrow. Betcha didn't know that. So men you better get out there and hug each other.

That's all I really feel like writing about now. I don't know if I'll be back soon or if I'll even be back at all. I&nbsp;probably will be with some amazing message or story. Life's really facinating and fabulous so I'll just be enjoying it. So if anyone reads this religiously, savour this journal and then like go out in the world and do something fun. It's too pretty to be sitting in front of your computer the whole time."

"event","Well if you haven't already guessed I FINISHED THE HOST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was the very best book&nbsp;I ever read EVER.&nbsp;I was like sobbing for the last five chapters&nbsp;before the two blank pages (those of you who have read it understand what I'm talking about). I just got soo attached to the characters. I think I love them&nbsp;all.&nbsp;It's a wonderful story&nbsp;of human nature I think. I think I'll read it sometime soon but&nbsp;I want to give myself&nbsp;some time to forget some of the facts&nbsp;so that I can enjoy it more. Other stuff happened but&nbsp;I&nbsp;can't&nbsp;really remember it because of how amazing&nbsp;The Host was. Oh! But&nbsp;I&nbsp;did do some writing and that was pretty fun so there. I don't really have time to finish this properly but&nbsp;I want to always&nbsp;remember that I finished&nbsp;The Host today and yeah. So that's all.

"event","<p>Umm, yeah hi to anyone who actually takes the time to read this journal. (Probably only Nikki but w/e) I'm in a livejournal mood so I'm gonna write in it for a bit. I don't know how often these entries are going to come but I would like to have something to look back on in a few years or whatever so I'm going to try and do something. Anyways, today was a pretty good day. I woke up like&nbsp;usual and read a chapter of Sybil. Her mother was totally messed up, I feel really bad for her.&nbsp;Then since&nbsp;I was still in a book mood I read another chapter of the Host and&nbsp;I LOVED IT! *spolier alert* It&nbsp;was all intense&nbsp;when Jared like kissed her but Melanie was&nbsp;all ""you can't kiss my&nbsp;man"" and she punched Jared in the face and hid in a box. But now I think Jared thinks that Melanie&nbsp;is still alive in Wanderer so that's all good. Maybe he'll stop hating on her now. *spolier alert over* Then I still felt like reading so I read a little of my Dear Canada books. (I'm supposed to have totally outgrown them by now but I still love reading them.) Wow, it seems like all&nbsp;I do is read sometimes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then I took a shower because I had an eye appointment today. I got all cleaned&nbsp;up and put on Pirates Of The Caribbean while&nbsp;I ate some&nbsp;warmed up leftovers and stuff.&nbsp;I'm watching the third one again right now and&nbsp;all I can say is JOHNNY DEPP I LOVE YOU! Jack&nbsp;Sparrow is so amazing he got into my livejournal name (hence the Sparrow in&nbsp;Alice Sparrow, sadly it isn't my real last name). I think he's&nbsp;better than Will but I know there are some&nbsp;Will lovers out there somewhere. They just saved him from Davy Jones's&nbsp;Locker and they did the whole intense&nbsp;up is down thing which is the best song&nbsp;on the third soundtrack. Now Elizabeth is in the brig on&nbsp;Davy Jones's ship and Will is in the brig&nbsp;on the Black Pearl for&nbsp;being a dirty traitor. Then I went to my appointment, I actually like going to eye appointments just like&nbsp;I&nbsp;actually like&nbsp;having blood taken. I have better than 20/20 vision without glasses so&nbsp;I'm really&nbsp;happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />I went to my grandparents because it was my Grandpa's 81st&nbsp;birthday (Happy Birthday Grandad!). We had cake&nbsp;and stuff and I talked with my cousins and relatives and stuff. My cousin Sinead got a tattoo which&nbsp;I guess&nbsp;that my dad told me about yesterday and I didn't remember but I don't really&nbsp;remember much about yesterday since&nbsp;I was soo tired. (not high or drunk just really really tired.&nbsp;I dont like&nbsp;bad stuff like that) Then me and Shaun&nbsp;bought our 100th game which happened to be Snowboarder Kids 2 and I bought Sonic Adventure&nbsp;2 Battle because I wanted to&nbsp;see my chaos again forever. I have five but I can usually only remember the names of&nbsp;my first two since the game names them for you. Chap and Nagoshi were my first two and I love them dearly. Now that&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;done my nerdy rant I'll get back to life. I played Harvest&nbsp;Moon DS Cute as well and it kept snowing so I've only seen&nbsp;Steiner like 2&nbsp;days so far in winter which is annoying since I&nbsp;really want to marry&nbsp;him but I&nbsp;only have like 25 sprites&nbsp;and I need one more house extension so its not like its going to happen anytime soon. (I know in North America his name is Skye but I like Steiner better)&nbsp;<br /><br />That's about all of today since now I'm home and writing this. I do have&nbsp;one thing to say about yesterday even though this is already a massive rant. FRANKIE CANNOT GET KICKED OUT OF MAKE ME A SUPERMODEL! He is soo awesome and is totally&nbsp;the best guy model there so they cannot kick him out! I will seriously hurt someone if he&nbsp;gets eliminated next week. But he won't since he is totally amazing. Also Jasper is being a little annoying like always but it's not like it's in my power to stop liking him (even though&nbsp;you think it would be) so I just wait for stuff to happen. I'll try and keep this journal posted if something awesome does&nbsp;happen. According to my Jones soda something should. And now we have reached the end of this amazingly long rant so farewell and I'll try and write soon!&nbsp;</p>"

"event","Well I was right, Friday's always are much better. I feel so much more like myself again. It didn't really start that good though. I woke up and went to school like normal but I couldn't find Jasper anywhere and thought that he wasn't there and that he went on vacation or something which would be good for him of course but bad for me. So I was all depressed during science but we did a lab and it was kinda fun so that was good and then after science I&nbsp; was walking with Livvie and just like talking and checking to see if we had goggle marks and stuff on our faces from the goggles we are forced to wear. We like paused near this one hallway and were talking and then Jasper came out of the hallway and was like standing there outside his second and I felt just soo much happier. So I went to math in a good mood and sir was good to us about the whole quiz thing. He really helped a lot so I was happy. Then I went to religion and we watched A Walk To Remember and started contact with Hercules. I went to go to the washroom because there was like no one in class and spent a&nbsp;few minutes talking to Dan. Then I went back to class and watched some more of the movie and now I totally have to watch it over the break because I forgot how much I like that movie. Then I had lunch where I hung out with Lisa and Meagan and totally found a lucky penny. Meagan thought she saw another one but it turned out to be an almond. Had a few Jasper sightings and went for a lovely walk. Then&nbsp;I took the long way to fourth and left Meagan to check what room we were supposed to be in. Then I took a long walk to my class and ran into Jasper again. Lovely. Then I got to my old second period where my teacher was watching us. We started to watch a movie but ended up playing this game instead. It was a pretty good time. And I got candy. Then I went home and Nicole came over. We started some writing and then just ended up making up this amazing video idea and laughing like soo hard. There is new love for Almost Edward out there. Then we drove Nikki home but it was like all snowy so it made driving kinda creepy but it was just soo beautiful. It looked like water flowing over the road almost. Then today where I went riding and rode Rascal and Tahoe. So it was a good time. Sadly, I don't have riding for two weeks but today was pretty good. Then my grandma drove us home and we went out for lunch and now I am here typing this and reading fanfiction. If I can last without Jasper I think this might just be a fun break."

"event","Ugh, fluttering. I used to like it but I'm starting to not really care for it. It's turning into my awkward days and those are becomming like fluttering. So weird. Anyways, today was a realtively normal kinda day. No weirdness really. Shoes did some shuffling, pretty loud shuffling. It sounded pretty creepy but that's Shoes for you. My math teacher got mad at the class for not getting the work but then&nbsp;he explained it to us. I don't think he likes me anymore though. I didn't get this one question and all... anyways&nbsp;I get it now that he explained it so hopefully I will do well on the quiz tomorrow. Religion&nbsp;was actually pretty good. I like copying notes for some reason. I find it kinda soothing so that went fairly well. Then lunch where&nbsp;I found out that Meagan didn't have my lunch but&nbsp;I found the other Megan and Lisa and Jess so that all went well. Ummm.... fourth was good I love history to be honest. I just find stuff like the war really interesting for some reason. Umm...&nbsp;I saw Jasper today but I'm feeling totally&nbsp;uninspired in that category at the moment. Ugh. He seems nice and I'm still incredibly fond of him but the longer this goes on the more&nbsp;doubting days&nbsp;I have. Mitchell totally noticed my lack of happiness too but of course he has no idea what it's&nbsp;about.&nbsp;People just can't seem to reconcile the image of&nbsp;me and unhappiness together but at the moment that's kinda how I'm feeling. Not like emo unhappiness just discontent. I think it's the lack of some substance in my life, not like drugs or&nbsp;drinking more like lack of something really good and exciting and new (aka Jasper probably). Anyways,&nbsp;yeah... this is a pretty depressing entry for me&nbsp;but whatever&nbsp;I don't really think before I write if you know what I mean.&nbsp;I really really feel like doing&nbsp;some fanfiction though&nbsp;hopefully me and Nikki&nbsp;can have a gathering soon. This is getting pretty long so&nbsp;I think I'm gonna cut&nbsp;it off here. Hopefully I'll be back soon with an interesting and exciting entry for whoever reads this.&nbsp;Fridays are usually exciting days.&nbsp;"

"event","YES ME!&nbsp;I AM BACK! YAY! I just totally felt like updating. I was like reading fanfiction and then&nbsp;I just totally felt this urge to like update&nbsp;ya know? So after all of these years&nbsp;I still remembered my username and password and&nbsp;I am back. (Even though it hasn't really been years or anything)&nbsp;But the last time&nbsp;I wrote it was like last year so yeah. Well that student teacher that Ms didn't know about totally turned out&nbsp;to be this guy who ended up like staying for awhile and then leaving around Christmas. (Like someone else&nbsp;I know) And then when&nbsp;I got back from this religion retreat I totally saw him again so yeah. I'm in a new semester which kinda sucks because NICOLE IS IN NONE OF MY CLASSES! NONE!&nbsp;AND WE&nbsp;DON'T EVEN HAVE THE SAME LUNCH!&nbsp;And to make matters worse JASPER ISN'T IN ANY OF MY CLASSES EITHER! Not that he knows that bothers me or anything.&nbsp;Still havn't said anything to the guy. (Yes&nbsp;Nicole&nbsp;I know NUDGES! but still&nbsp;I am totally sockward.) But he&nbsp;does&nbsp;have my lunch so yeah. Piano is still good&nbsp;and fun and&nbsp;I am totally back at riding so that's at least good too. I havn't been up to much since my last time&nbsp;on here but&nbsp;I have been writing. I&nbsp;have found that I love writing. It's like really fun&nbsp;so that's what I've been doing. I have two stories up on&nbsp;my own and one that I&nbsp;am writing with Nikki. Take Me To The Beach, Everything That Means Something and Daylight.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;another story in mind&nbsp;so I expect to be writing more sometime soon. Take Me To The Beach may have died though since I totally cannot think of&nbsp;what to do next and all. So I'm going to write a new Twilight story! I'll say when it's up on my beloved fanfiction. But&nbsp;yeah if anyone even reads this they probably won't care about any of that. Today is a snowday so&nbsp;that's kinda why&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;on here. I'm happy that&nbsp;I get no homework +&nbsp;I&nbsp;got to sleep in and&nbsp;I am eating french toast since my brother was supposed to be eating french toast at school today. But&nbsp;I am sad that I do not get to see Jasper which&nbsp;I know is weird but totally true. I'm just one&nbsp;of those odd people who get all weird like that. Anyways that's about all, hopefully I will get back to updating regularly because that is something&nbsp;I should probably do.&nbsp;"

"event","Hello everyone. I'm going&nbsp;straight into the updating. Monday was uneventful, for the most part. I was in giggly mode which is almost like normal with + confidence. Music was the usual affair as far as I can remember. Except I predicted that Wolfboy would be in stalking mode and he ended up sitting right behind us for a few minutes. Same with the rest of the day really not too much else of interest. Correct me if I'm wrong Nikki. Oh, well speaking of Nikki she did contact Wolfboy again and I am very proud. Went home sent a couple emails, ate dinner, did homework and then went to piano. I love piano by the way, it's only my second lesson but I really like my teacher and I'm learning a lot of stuff. I'm now learning Victor's Piano Solo from corpse bride which I love already even if it is pretty hard. I'm also learning The Scientist by Coldplay which&nbsp;is pretty fun and also on the Twilight playlist which makes it even more&nbsp;amazing. Then let's see... ummm Run Mouse Run and Beugle Call or something like that. And all of the A&nbsp;minor scales. So it's a pretty eventful lesson. Then I came home and practised the&nbsp;piano until bedtime.&nbsp;Now today which I actually&nbsp;remember and&nbsp;can comment on. First I came to&nbsp;school and went up with two of my friends to their lockers. While we were walking up the stairs&nbsp;Shoes started following us! I had to say ""Since it's raining maybe I should have got some BOOTS."" Then he left us. Then I went to my locker and then to the main staircase and then when I turned around to go to class Jasper walked right in front of me from the Cafeteria. I veered slightly so I wouldn't walk into him and the drums and beat. I think my heart paused for&nbsp;a moment and since he's a vampire he must have heard it. Then I continued&nbsp;on&nbsp;my way to class where I commenced my prowling&nbsp;by laughing for no reason and then crying because I was laughing&nbsp;so hard. I must have looked so odd. Also we have a student teacher that Ms didn't know about which was interesting. Then I went to&nbsp;english where nothing really happened and then lunch where the&nbsp;shoes continued their stalking. Then civics and french where we had a teacher sit in and watch.&nbsp;Sorry if I sound a wee bit odd but seeing the conductor do his little-head-flick-thing-that-is-supposed-to-move-hair-in-his-eyes-but-there-is-no-hair-in his-eyes-thing made me smile a little. Then home where I am writing this and doing nothing else of interest. Also I have this song from music in my head called hands across the sea which reminds me of the circus, hence my entry title."

Starting with Monday where my brother came back from Muskoka and had a really good time so I'm happy&nbsp;for him. Other stuff happened I believe I contacted Emmett.&nbsp;Umm i was sick on thursday but it's a good&nbsp;thing i was or we wouldn't have invented hormonitis! The wonderful disease that&nbsp;effects all tenth&nbsp;grade and&nbsp;up. I was on the prowl on friday and really really was out of control. luckly nikki wasn't as affected as me and she managed to keep me from harming those around&nbsp;me. then the beautiful weekend came but sadly no jasper on&nbsp;the weekend. i baby sat this cute little boy with my friend and got to be an evil villian (insert evil laugh).

"event","I'm back and updating! First I'll talk about Thursday because&nbsp;sadly it is the farthest back I can remember from this week unless I really sit and think about it. Thursday was a pretty good day because first of all I started contact with&nbsp;Jacob/wolfboy/candidate JBJ! We were sitting in music class, me and Nikki, and he was juggling&nbsp;with two drum sticks and I was just like ""I can't juggle, you're really lucky that you can."" and he was like ""Well it would be better if I had three sticks."" and then he dropped the two sticks he was holding and had to caress them for forgiveness from their owner. So&nbsp;yeah,&nbsp;the rest of the&nbsp;day was&nbsp;good. Some stuff I was hoping for came true on Grey's Anatomy. George told Callie and something else good happened so that was all good.&nbsp;Oh and the sub brought cookies for us and we saw&nbsp;the talent show where the sound was horrible but I was still fun to watch. Then was Friday and Nikki wasn't there but somehow I managed to survive outside of our fluffy pink vampire bubble filled with Jasper and Edward posters.&nbsp;Candidate JBJ talked to me again so that was good. Then in french poor Jasper was sitting alone and I wanted so badly to go sit beside his Jasperness and watch/talk to him but alas the situation never happened. Either he or I have to get some serious courage because this limbo could go on for a long time. Then weekend and me and Nikki talked for like 3 hours on the phone about plans for contacting our cast members and other random things. Then I visited my Meemow and stuff and today I saw my grandma and grandpa before they went to Flordia. Oh and Shaun went to Muskoka on Friday, so I miss him. And that's all and stuff so bye again."

"event","<p>Well this weekend was as busy as last weekend, maybe even more so. I went to see Les Miserables on friday with my friend Melissa and her friends. It was AMAZING! The sound wasn't really working at first so I didn't know what was going on but then once it started working it was wonderful and they had amazing voices. I've been&nbsp;singing/humming&nbsp;""Masters of the rent"" all weekend long (my brother now officially hates the song). Then on Saturday I went to my grandma's house to say goodbye to my Uncle Desmond. Me and my brother and my cousins played this game my cousin Mikki's friend Patty taught her. It's called 'In my pants'. You say a song or movie title and then you say or think in my pants. It may sound stupid but we had a great time for like an hour just thinking of different songs and things. Then we played an old favourite of mine the Hi Mary game. Where you go Hi Mary, Hello Mary, How's Mary, Fine over and over until someone messes up and since&nbsp;my brother&nbsp;was there he was Larry. I'm not really explaining it that well. Then Nikki came over and we looked at cast members and planned some more hunting/stalking ideas for our cast. Then we went through the yearbook and gave people levels in our pool of life down at the high&nbsp;school. Me and Nikki are swimming! Then Nikki got me myspace, which I think I might go work on soon. Then today was my grandma's party and we served and ate lots of food. Life is soo good right now except I think I have a blister on my feet from the shoes I was wearing today. We have tons of leftovers though so I think I might be having some more food sometime soon. And.. that's all except I have to add one thing about Grey's Anatomy on Thursday. George! Just break up with Callie, you really love Izzy and as much as she says she doesn't want to hear it it isn't helping her! So yeah... and I totally think Meredith should break it off with McDreamy for a bit and go out with McSteamy (highly unlikely but still possible) she can always go back to him later. She should also talk to her sister just a little bit to see what she's like. And now that's all. Bye Bye!</p>"

Grandparents party was really good too. I got to wear a dress and seat people. And say a reading in the&nbsp;mass.&nbsp;Then we ate food and looked at this amazing cake and then ate the cake. Me and my cousin&nbsp;talking about&nbsp;""Sleep..ing!"" (Nikki knows what I'm talking about) I'm going to skip&nbsp;Monday and Tuesday because not much happened same with Sunday. Today I&nbsp;tried to play this REALLY hard music in music. I have to hear something first before I can learn it and so now that I have heard it maybe I will get a wee bit better. Then english where sadly I learned that Livie is over Jarvis. Then lunch where she wasn't really over Jarvis anymore, which was&nbsp;confusing but fun. Dylan&nbsp;is trying to convert us to becomming Roberts servants. But since we&nbsp;have amazingly amazing vampire brain power we will not be swayed! Then we walked&nbsp;for Terry and&nbsp;me and Nikki talked about how perfect Jasper and Carlisle are for their parts and how we will convert them to our side. Then french and then home where I am reading fanfiction and found an amazing new term that we must use! It is Alice and Bella's term. Asfaawbffe. Absolutely superly fantastic and awesomely weird best friends for enternity!&nbsp;So perfect another code. And now that's it because&nbsp;Private Practise is on in like 4 mins. Bye bye.&nbsp;"

And of course watching McSteamy confess (but not really) his (not real) love for McDreamy was entertaining. McSteamy, Jasper, Jack Sparrow... ALL MINE! (beats back fangirls with blunt object)&nbsp; Ahh... so now that the ranting is over I can begin the real rant of catching up. Missed school Tuesday because I couldn't stand without feeling like I was going to fall over. Then of course I had to get a filling and half my face was frozen for an hour. Wednesday was better. I can't believe I'm saying this but I was actually kind of happy to be back. I actually enjoy school which is weird but really nice.&nbsp;More Jasper encounters at lunch with a little bit of Carslisle and Jarvis thrown in. Now onto today. School was fun, Olivia came up with a lovely Jarvis summoning song. Then I told her if she wanted Jarvis to come she should just ask the universe. Then amazingly vampire Jasper was summoned by the universe because he glided in from the cafeteria right at that moment and walked by us. So magical! Then the rest of the day was exhausting and stuff. I promise I'll try and find time for MSN soon Nikki. But anyways... time for me to go. I'll be back soon!</p>"

"event","<p>Okay let's see... i'll do some quick catching up. On Sunday I met my grandma's new pug puppy who we are now calling Emily. She is so cute and she curled up to sleep on my lap too! I love her and all the other wonderful animals in my life. Now today was actually really good. I did pretty well on my music test. Watched Remember the Titans in english. Then a great lunch, sitting on benches with our backs to the sun. Then we went to wait in the atrium. Our observations have been going well, our ""cast"" is comming together nicely. Then of course, I have to make a mistake that may creep out Jasper for years to come. I was standing with Nikki, Christine and Olivia when Jasper walked by with a few friends. I leaned in to whisper to Nikki who had her back to him. I said ""look behind you"" and she turned and I looked and Jasper froze in spot and of course turned to look at us while we were staring at him. (He probably heard me with his vampire hearing.) His eyes windened in fear and he continued walking. I told Nikki about how I saw fear and we both started cracking up laughing. I practically cried I was laughing so hard. Then we went to civics and got to go on the computer. Then of course was french and I almost started laughing again because not only was Jasper there but we had a creepy sub as well. I tried my best to avoid eye contact with both Jasper and the sub. Luckly then class ended and we were safe to go home. With hopefully no harm done. Nikki got us an editor too. Good job Nikki! Now all we need to do is find an Edward and Charlie and Renee and James and Victoria and Laurent and then we can start operation get cast members to say yes and turn novel into script. Time is of the essence!</p>"

On Friday I had to do my music thingy in front of the class and that wasn't awful (though it was pretty bad) I liked listening to everyone else's songs that they chose. Then and english test and some boring civics. I've&nbsp;come to the realization that I might just hate civics (gasp!). I DO NOT want to make a political party or vote or anything in my civics class. I wish that we just did career education all semister long. Then french where Nikki and I continued our ""observations."" Then I came home and went to my friend Melissa's house for a sleepover. We watched this movie called we are marchal (think i spelt it wrong) and we walked down to my old house where I stood across the street and watched it for like five minutes and hopefully (though doubtfully) didn't freak out the people who live there. I had the weirdest longing to just knock on the door and ask if I could look around but I didn't. Then back to Melly's where we talked about Grey's Anatomy and clothes and Shaun and Joey kept trying to listen in (so anoying) though I still love you Shaun and I won't say that about Joey so I don't freak him out. Then we finally (FINALLY!!!) got some sleep. Then we walked down to Tim Hortons and got some bagel breakfast sandwiches and a bottle of water. Then I went riding and Melly watched. I rode Dusty and had a really good time. Then went to the mall to&nbsp;see Rebecca from Canada's Next Top Model. SO COOL! She looks exactly the same and sounds the same as she did on tv and she was really nice to everyone there. I wish I had brought my camera! Then to my aunt's house for&nbsp;my cousin and uncle's birthdays. Played sims with my cousin and saw the cutest baby alive there.&nbsp;Now I'm exhausted and home. Though tomorrow I get to see my grandma's new pug puppy! So happy!&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Tuesday was sooo much better than monday. Probably because I found a dime on the ground on the way into school. Ten days of good luck! Went to music, Nikki was back at school. Yay! Music just wasn't the same without you Nikki.&nbsp;We spent the whole class just playing things and stuff like that. Then english where we got into to groups for drama stuff. For once I actually have lots of friends in my class. Me, Meagan, Olivia and Jessica were in a group. It's gonna be so much fun. I found out that Jessica is as obessed with Pirates of the Caribbean as&nbsp;I am. Then lunch with Nikki, Christine, Rose, Olivia, and Jessica (couldn't find Alycia). We ate in the middle of the football field, which was interesting and enjoyable. Then civics where I found out that Alyssa rides at the same stable as I do! That was lovely, now I have Jessica for pirates talk, Nikki for vampires and wizards, Alyssa for horses and Melissa for doctors. I'm so happy! All I need now is my own human Jasper. (Because I don't want to be the old lady dating a nineteen (?) year old forever. He must grow old i suppose) But enough on that. Then french where we had a test which I think I might have messed up a little bit on (maybe a lot). Then I went out to Simply Tai for some food with my brother and my grandma. I had pad tai with scallops and now I'm stuffed. I gotta do homework and beg my dad for piano lessons. Ta ta for now!</p>"

"event","<p>(sigh) Monday... my least favourite day of the week. It wasn't all bad and all but it was just too ordinary. Went to music class and tried to explain (unsuccessfully) why I didn't want to do band this year. I just have so much going on and I don't have time to practise my flute. Plus I hate feeling like a fifth wheel. I really don't think flute is my instrument anymore, the passion is gone. I'm going to do my music class and then I'll just focus solely on piano. And everyone has to just accept it! (bangs fist on desk... rubs sore hand) Moving on... English was fine, actually it was really good. We just did some silent seat work, which sadly is one of my favourite things to do in a class. Then I went to Civics because amazingly we had second lunch today. Half the class showed up forty minutes late so we didn't do much. But of course I was dying of hunger by the end of class. Then I had lunch with Cassie and Meagan. Then french where we learned about our huge test and best part of the day... YEARBOOKS!!! So much fun. I'm actually in it in a few pages. Now I have to do homework so bye!</p>"

"event","Well yesterday was a&nbsp;barrel of fun! So many good things to do. I've got to do all of my homework today but... oh well! See on Friday I was on the phone with my friend Meagan and&nbsp;I reached into my sweater pocket and found an old fortune from a fortune cookie&nbsp;I must have eaten. I opened it up and it <em>said 'You'll got more done this week if you have some fun this weekend.</em>' I&nbsp;don't even remember getting it or anything. Must be those magic vampires at work again. So I listened to&nbsp;them. Also on Friday was my grandpa's party. That was lovely. Hung out with my brother and my cousin Micaela (who got her&nbsp;ears pirced. I'm the only one&nbsp;who doesn't have them done yet now.)&nbsp;She told us about&nbsp;her future child&nbsp;Mime who is going to have mime makeup permanently on his face and his mouth sewed shut. He sounds like such a lovely child. Then my grandpa did this&nbsp;speech and my grandma sang. Then this guy spun in circles while playing the accordian. All in all it was an interesting night full of fun and carrot cake.&nbsp;<br />Now I can get to Saturday. Went shopping with Alycia, Cassandra, Christine and Meagan. I bought lots of stuff again. I'm getting really good at shopping. First I went to Claire's and got some clip on earings to match my dress for my grandparents party in two weeks. Now I really want to get my ears pirced. Then we looked around&nbsp;and lost Cassie and Alycia. Got some frozen yogurt and ten thousand napkins from Yogen Fruz. I can't go to the mall without getting something from there now. Then we found Alycia and Cassie and sat on a bench while I finished my yogurt. Then I dragged Meagan and Christine into Chapters to look at books. Alycia and Cassie said that they were going to be on the second level of the food court.(More important later) I found two lovely books! One called To Catch a Pirate. Which is a romance about a girl and a pirate I believe. And one called Thirsty about a boy who thinks he's turning into a vampire. I almost had a heart attack when I found that one and then I was all giggly and anoying for a few minutes after. Then I got a lovely bookmark that says SHH! I'm reading. Meagan and Christine found stuff too so that was all good. Then we went to the Body Shop and I got a vanilla body spray so that I'll smell edible if I ever run into Jasper or any other vampires. Then we decided to go and find Cassie and Alycia and since I'm so dense I thought that they said they were on the second floor of the mall so we went upstairs to the Bay and ended up buying lindor chocolate. Then we went and ate at Burger King because we still couldn't find Alycia and Cassie. I got a vanilla milkshake. Then we finally found Cassie and Alycia and we sat at a table in Starbucks until my mom came to pick us up. Meagan ran into her house to grab pjs and so did Christine and Cassie. (Alycia couldn't come to my house after) Then we sat around in our pjs and played Wii Sports until it stopped working and then Friends Trivia and then I told lovely choose your own way stories that I'm getting really good at. And that was my Saturday. Today I'll flop in my pjs and do my homework I suppose. I also have to learn to shorten my journal entries."

"event","Well here it goes, my first entry on here! I hope I can keep a pretty good thing going and make at least one entry a week, maybe more. Let's see anything interesting happen today... it started as any other day following a twisted dream, which afterwards I was feeling really refreshed. Ummm... ate some dates and crackers for breakfast got a ride to school. Went to music and hung out with Nikki and played flute. Doubting if I'm good enough for jazz band this year. Maybe I'll skip it and take piano lessons instead, i love piano. Umm went&nbsp;to english and nothing really amazing happened. Lunch was fun though me and Nikki started our recruting of the vampire lovers for our twilight feature film.&nbsp;Impossible to find any Edwards or Jaspers or Emmetts or any other male vampires. Easy to find Tylers and&nbsp;Mikes and such. I know way too many anoying guys (cough)&nbsp;Tyler R., Mitchell (cough). Not that I mean it if they read this. You are both lovely people.&nbsp;Civics is a bit boring and stuff so not much happened there and french was french pretty fun to listen to but not much to say. I have become a sworn enemy of the light switch travellers, I must battle them with my speed and venomus teeth!&nbsp;Then I came home and signed&nbsp;up on here and that's it. Hope this was passable as an entry. I'm going shopping tomorrow so maybe I'll have something to put then.&nbsp;Bye bye. 

p.s. Bought a lovely pirates of the caribbean calender. so pretty!&nbsp;"

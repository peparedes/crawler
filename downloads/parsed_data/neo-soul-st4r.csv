"event","hrm..  i guess today was a good day. school was cool and after school me, britt, smurff,and dre went to fuquay.  then me and britt went to swim practice and no one was there hardly. Can you say OFF DAY?? Anyways, i have been having a hard time lately, actually. From the arguments with friends, to the exams, to the boys,...i just dont know man.  I'm healthy, but i feel sick inside.  I dont even know why i write anymore, how come i never get messages like ""knock..can i come in"" or ""you sound soo cool, add me""  im tired of not coming home to a perfect happy family.  im tired of having to go to school wearing the same clothes every week. im tired of having friends that wont even talk 2 eachother anymore, im tired of being alone. im tired of not having the option of being picky. im tired of all the weight of my friends being held on me. im tired of living the way i do. im tired of Randoll. im tired of chris. im tired of not having 250 dollars to spend on my friends' christmas gifts. im tired of christmas. im tired of coming to school and not seeing shannon and lauren. im sick and tired of being sick and tired.  i really think i am pretty, so why is it that no one else sees it? obviously becuz im fat and no one likez fat chix.  im tired of mo'nique and star jones and queen latifah.  what ever happened to Rachel?  it seems like im jealous...well, dammit, i am jealous, but i dont give a fuck right now.  im soo mad at just about everything in my life. everybody i love is constantly getting an attitude with me or mad at me or acts like they dont care at all.  yes im talking to you, jamie, mom, dad, maine, chey, britt, melissa, tiff, scottie g.  i just cant take it.  im not suicidal, thats crazy, but i just want.. no I NEED some attention! do any of you ever feel this way??  holla  Rachel"

"event","I am soo happy.. omg.  OKa.. yesterday at school i went with my first period class to Brookfield nursing home and we sang them songs.  It was so much fun.  Then later at school me and my friend emily finally presented our project fohonors english 4 and it was a short play.  Mrs futrell and my class said it was awesome, so hopefully i will get a 100 on it.  Then lunch was fun,so much drama at our school, so many stuck up girls and boys that think that just becuz they live in a 2 story house and have all kinds of money and maybe are prettier than other people that they can just catch an attitude and think thats that.  Trust..plz believe that one must not.. cannot catch an attitude with me, cuz ill set them straight and send em home.  Anyways.. so lunch was pretty fun, then in 4th period, we had a free period, just talking.  Last night, my friends Brittani, Tiffani, Matt, and Smurff and I went skating in north raleigh. i had a lot of fun fallin down, and i took them down with me. After that we went to Waffle House and then chilled at Brittni's house till like 12:45.  I got home at like 1 am, and got a call from my sweetie andrew from camp.  we talked for about 20 minutes, and then told him i was kinda tired.  it was only 10 pm in Wahington state(where he lives) so he wasnt that tired.  anyways, i woke up this morning to a doorbell at 6:20 when my friend Melissa P. came to get a calculator from me, she's talking the ACT this morning.  Well, i'll holla, imma bout to go to my friend NeTeisha's house and shill wit her and Crystal.  oh, and if for some crazy reason my ""friend"" CharMaine is reading...

1. Feels funny when suddenly u are the one recieveing an attitude
2. I still dont see anything wrong wit what i said
3. Funny how you always seem to call me stuck on myself when alot of guys at HC are scared to come up to you for that exact reason.
4. Parting is such sweet sorrow
5. FYI: i got cheyenne's present on thursday night before the concert
6. Just cuz u seem to have it all, it doesnt mean you do, your feisty, bitchy attitude made you lose a friend that was true
7. Realize, no matter what u can say about me, it wont hurt my feelings and that i still wuv ya when u make me mad, realiz that if you die today, you will die with hatred in your heart towards me, and God wont like that, so i chose to forgive, let's see how big you are and if you do the same!

Holla - Tell me again....  Rachel"

"event","i am in fear for my life!!!!  Okay, today was terrible at my school.  My high school is known for good behavior for the most part, last school year we only had about 3 fight the WHOLE year.  Today... we had a fight during 1st period, a guy got caught with a knife, there were ""randoM"" searches during 2nd period in which the principal found bullets in this dude's jacket.  At lunch, there were 2 fights, not to mention complete lockdown watch by administrators, and right before the bell rang to get out of school, my ""friend""(i kinda like him & ive had word that he feels the same,but now hes suspended) got in a fight with another friend of mine(Travis). also, yesterday afternoon my friend tonio beat up this cocky junior named will.  OKay...i dont know what to think.  That is not to mention all of the fights today that got broken up by administrators before they actually started.  On top of all that drama.. about 3 weeks ago, my homegirl Neteisha was at church and a prophet and her pastor both prophesied that someone at my school, HCHS, was going to bring a gun to school and.... yeah.   I am really in fear for my life here, i have no enemies that i can think of, but most people die by people they dont even know.  Think of Colombine and the whole ""Do you love Jesus"" i think thats what they said.  Anyways.. does this drama happen at anyone elses school? plz lemme know.  ..Till the sun comes out and shinez again.. plz let it shine, God!     Rachel"

"event","okay.. i will sum up my day.  I woke up late with a sore throat.  I got out of bed and washed up, brushed my pearly whitez, and ate a lil sumthin sumthin.  I figured i was gonna be late for school and if i get another tardy, ill get afterschool detention, so i wrote and forged a note to the school saying i had respiratory problems this mornin (i have acute asthma)  My first pd class is vocal ensemble(singing), but i could hardly talk, let alone sing, so i just listened to the rest of the ensemble all period.  By the way, our winter concert is this thursday. HaHaHa!  2nd period i have spanish and i had to argue wit my friend melissa about why she and my other friend britt should start talking again(be friends again)..long story.  3rd period honors english 4, we just read Frankenstein silently all period.  BOOOORRIINNGG!  lunch was okay.  4th period journalism is my fave class, but i felt like shit, so i called my daddy and he said i could go home n rest.  I have been either asleep trying to breathe in my bed or at this computer playing games trynna relax.  I feel sooo bad.  My mom says i dont hafta go to school 2morro. Hopefully i will get better overnight and pull a Ferris Bueller!

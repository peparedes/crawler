After having the month of November off due to my fender bender in which I got a pretty nasty case of whiplash, I am finally back to work on my usual hours. Which, you know...sucks since I don't like working there. But hopefully with the new year will come good luck for me...for once. 

I'm hoping this 'storm' that's supposed to show up tomorrow is really horrible, just because I want to get off work early and hope to all that is holy that I don't get called to work on Friday cause they be crazy, yo, if they think I'm coming in when it's like that out! (Friday's one of my 2 flipping days off this week...dear work: leave me alone on that day PLEASE!!)

Speaking of crazy, some of the people that I know are completely gone and I feel I should put them in an institute...but I don't think I can actually do that. 

I'm going to say ""Happy Holidays!!!!"" now because we can all see just how good I am at updating!

Happy Holidays, I hope everyone has a wonderful time this year!"

(I work with my arms up, can't do that when the muscles are spazzing like they're on freakin' crack.) But at least that gives me time away from that hell hole I call a job. (No, it hasen't gotten any better.) Although I still need to write about my weekend in VA. Well, the one night I don't remember too much of...but it's a good story and tells just how good of a friend my Kimmy is, and poor Lay had to have Kimmy's pukey hand in her face on the drive home...hahaha. 

Oddly enough I saw a Hanson concert recently. I know what you're thinking...The Mmmbop boys are still around? Yes they are, and that little one on the drums has grown up NICE. Even better is the fact that their music is wonderful, it's only gotten better, please don't make fun, I know not all my music tastes are wonderful, but give me props, I've got Johnny Cash going right now. I'm gonna try to post soon, no promises cause I really suck at that lately.

"event","<P>So I know it's been awhile since I've updated, but it's been a bad, BAD week. Actually, this month has pretty much just been horrid. I was supposed to go on vacation and I had like three places that I could go. Then the red bitch from work told me this: ""We hired you to fill in for everyone else so you can't have a vacation until everyone else is finished."" Was anyone else scheduled for the time I asked off? No. She? Is a horrid bitch. She is queen of the bitches...so on and so forth. </P>
<P>So that started this month. Along with my great Aunt getting sick and being in the hospital for like 10 days. Her cancer was back, she started Chemo...she got to go home. Not even a week later and she was back in the hospital. Unfortunately she never came out. May she rest in peace. This has not been a good month. I'm looking forward to getting August over with. But basically I have nothing to look forward to. (DAMNIT I DIDN'T GET TO GO SEE MY STEELERS...FREE F*CKING TICKETS!!! I HATE MY JOB <FONT color=#ff0000><FONT size=5><U><STRONG>SOOOOO</STRONG></U></FONT> </FONT>BAD!!)</P>
<P>There was a bunch of shit in between that crap too.&nbsp; I just don't have the energy to bitch about it. Oh, yeah I'm sick too. Some sinus-ey, cold-ish blah crap that I don't really know how to get rid of, but my new favorite drug is Drixoral. It works wonders for my congestion, runny nose, sneezing crap...it's amazing, I can breath through my nose again!)</P>
<P>A few good point to this month:</P>
<P>Brad Paisley's new CD (whish is great), the Killers special edition CD with 3 new songs on it, I bought Dane Cook CD's and DVD's, plus just yesterday I bought the second season of The O.C. (I love me some Ryan Atwood...RAWR!!) and the second season of ALF (which I'm watching right now). So I will say goodbye for now.</P>
<P>OH!&nbsp;OH! OH! OH! OH! OH! I almost forgot I have two things to look forward to. My parents are (finally) buying that car they promised me...I test drove it today, and I bought me and my dear Rae two tickets to see HANSON! (I know, shut up...but the thirteen year old inside of me is like crying out of pure giddy-ness and glee. SO excited!!)</P>"

<P>On a better note, I spent lots of money last week. (4 CD's &amp;&nbsp;4 DVD's) Well, the DVD's were Wayne's World 1&amp;2 and Ghostbusters 1&amp;2 so it wasn't really 4 different DVD's. The CD's however were two of the O.C. soundtrack mixes, one was Lifehouse cause I LOVE the song You and Me, and a Johnny Cash CD cause I felt I needed one and it was on sale. </P>

Now, she is one of those cute little old lady's. She's frail and you know, 'cute old lady.'&nbsp;She tells my Mom that she has had chest pains for awhile and has not slept all night. Off Mom and Dad go to the hospital. I go to work at noon...at that time I had talked to my Dad and everything is seeming alright. By the time I got home, that was no longer the story. Congestive heart failure is what the doctor said. Plus some sort of infection, she is now in the Cardiac ICU because they could not get her stabilized. Talk about scary. My Mom actually said the words, ""They really thought they were going to lose her."" It wasn't fun. So I did my thing and shut everyone out and pouted. That's me.</P>
<P>But as of right now, she's doing better. Not perfect, there's Cancer again...but she's doing better. I'm tired and I get to babysit Gram and Pap tomorrow (Plus it's Gram's Birthday) so I need to finish watching The OC for the night, oh and maybe eat. Perhaps I'll eat my arm. SO HUNGRY!</P>"

Crissy, your card MADE my day...I can't begin to thank you enough. Gregg, honestly I was surprised...I kind of thought you might have forgotten Way to go, and love you. Chelle, I believe I already thanked you, I loved my gift(s). Kim, we'll celebrate this weekend I'm sure. Cassie, I promise we'll get together and I know I'll love whatever it is you got me. </P>
<P>As for the 'Happy' Birthday greetings, I say thank you. But maybe I'll touch that one a different night...like when I tell just how not-good my Birthday was...for another night though...there are other thoughts brewing.</P>
<P>So I need a different job. Cause the one I have doesn't hold my attention and therefore I spend all day thinking. Like today. Oddly enough my boss managed to REALLY irritate me without even being there. (I plan on cutting the phone lines tomorrow.) But here's the thing that's basically SCARING THE SHIT out of me. I'm seriously considering going back to college. Why? I wish I knew. I have no reason to want to. No direction to go to. All I know is the following:</P>
<P>I really fucking hated my experience at college, I can see no hope of starting over and it suddenly being ok.</P>
<P>I really fucking hate my job. It is not fun. I don't like what I'm doing at all. I am getting nowhere.</P>
<P>I&nbsp;believe I just realized why I've been thinking college. It's the only way I'll ever get out of this town that I hate with the depths of my soul. If I do college I could get a job, a real one...very unlike the one I have now. One where I can hate my boss cause of regular reasons, not ones like, 'If she fucking fake smiles at <EM>ME</EM> again I think I'll rip her hair out.' Yeah. I'm super nice. Ugh. I have no way out, nothing to look forward to...and soon enough the one friend that has been here this summer will go back to school. Oh yes, there it is again...the successful depression-esque funk I seem to find myself in more and more lately. I think I just need a friend that I know isn't going to leave me or ignore me. Be it 3 hours away or 45 minutes. I need someone to have my back when I need to talk. Right now, sure the phone is great. But every once-in-a-while you need someone to go to the bar and grab a beer or two. I couldn't even get that on my Birthday. I'm done, no more pityness for me. However there is much more going on in my brian.</P>
<P>I bought myself a Birthday present that would have been on my list, had I made one. To be honest there were like 5 things on my list,&nbsp;unfortunately all but one was actually do-able. So I bought it myself. I am now the proud owner of the First Season of The O.C. It is so magical and I have a feeling that sooner or later I will let everyone know just why I am so obsessed. I love all of the characters, or love to hate them. Besides Lost, The O.C. is the only show I MUST SEE! Lost is Lost and if you've seen it you know why it's so great. But The O.C. is fantastic. I see myself in Seth's sarcastic-ness. I want Ryan. (Seriously, just give me him and I'll be happy...I love that guy.) (Yeah, Benjamin McKenzie is my new old obsession. I'll explain that one: I used to have the uber celebrity crush on him but it died some when the show was done for the season, yeah now I'm all about him again...and I like it that way. <FONT size=1>Just so you know I sang that last line</FONT>.) </P>
<P>I think bed cause I have to work at that place again tomorrow. *Cue Sideshow Bob grumble here* <FONT size=2>(Yay for The Simpson's reference!)</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>OK people, here are a few pointers for when you visit your stylist for a haircut, style, perm, color, or what have you.</P>
<P>#1-Think of it like you're going to the dentist. FOR REAL. If your breath is STANK, brush your damn teeth. The LAST thing that you want to smell while you are ALREADY washing someone's smelly head is their STANK breath. Just brush you teeth, or at least put in a <FONT size=4>very strong</FONT> breath mint.</P>
<P>#2-If you don't know what you want, FIND A FLIPPIN' PICTURE. How many times have I had someone sit down in my chair and I politely ask (with a smile), ""What would you like done today?"" Then&nbsp;I get the answer, ""I don't know, I just want a change."" Because no matter HOW much I want to say it, I think I might be fired if I responded with, ""Well, if you're looking for a big change I could shave parts of your head, die other parts bright orange, and still manage to over-process those parts left with a perm."" For some reason, I have a feeling my boss might not like me saying that. Although every time I hear, ""Oh, I don't know."" I just want to say, ""OK let's get the clipper's out and how's a number 2 sound? All over? GREAT!""</P>
<P>#3-Let's say you have long hair and want to keep it long, you just want the dead ends cut off. Well sweetie, if you haven't had you hair cut in 3 years I'm afraid that getting half an inch off isn't going to do squat. You haven't had your dead ends cut off for 3 years? Then I'm gonna have to take off about 5 inches just to get your hair looking healthy. You stupid freaking retard, get your hair trimmed once every six&nbsp;weeks and you wouldn't look like a freaking horse tail. (All&nbsp;pretty at the top and thin, icky, stringy gross-ness at the bottom.)</P>
<P>#4-Tip, people. Tip, please. For instance, at the place where I work (like many other places), we don't get a portion of what we charge you. We do a service for you, that's when you're supposed to tip. If you don't have that much, it doesn't matter, trust me...if you give anything it is greatly appreciated <FONT size=2>and we won't make fun of you when you leave</FONT>. <FONT size=1>(Haha, just kidding.)</FONT></P>
<P>#5-Don't apologize for making someone cut off more.&nbsp;I am there to do this, you are paying for it...get what you want. Don't come in 3 days later and say, I want it shorter. Trust me, I would rather cut your hair 4 times and have it be the right length and what you want rather than you leave with it too long. (Or too short.) But do not apologize for asking so, sometimes it's hard to imagine an inch or half an inch off all over...I understand if you want it shorter.</P>
<P>#6-Talk. Don't sit there and give a one-word answer to a question that could obviously have a much more interesting answer. You don't want to be seen as one of those people who never shuts up? I would rather have someone talk the entire time and barely get a word in edge wise myself than have complete silence the whole time. When you don't talk, a lot of times&nbsp;I think&nbsp;I am doing something wrong and you are unhappy...if that's the case just say what is bothering you about your experience.</P>
<P>#7-SPEAK UP. Honestly, if you don't believe&nbsp;I am&nbsp;giving you what you asked for...say something before it's too late. If it feels like&nbsp;I am&nbsp;going to short, bring it up...tell me. If&nbsp;I can't make you happy, then&nbsp;I'm not doing&nbsp;my job. Also, if there is a hair dryer or something making noise, raise your voice another decibel...it's hard enough to hear you when you mumble anyway. (Can you tell what a good day I've had?)</P>
<P>#8-Don't come in acting like you're better than everyone on the planet. You're not. Especially if you live in or around my town. Trust me, you're not all that and we would all be better off if you could kiss your own ass in the privacy of your own home. Also? If you make that much money, why leave a dollar tip when you know I just made you look 10 times better? Open your wallet instead of your mouth, kthnx!</P>
<P>#9-PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't hum the tune you are hearing in your head, you make me feel like I should have a big man in a white coat standing beside me just to make sure you don't think the pointy scissors should be taken from my hands and shoved into my head...leave the crazy at home.</P>
<P>#10-If your hair is short, black, and thin...don't walk in thinking you're going to walk out looking like Jessica Simpson. (Yeah, the girl can get annoying but she's entertaining, and I'll be damned if that girl's hair doesn't *usually* look amazing.) If that's what you want, you're not gonna get it in 3 hours. You'll need extensions, and money cause that shit doesn't come cheap. If you have longer straight hair and want curls...the only way you're going to get them is with a perm. Trust me, any stylist knows what they are doing...and if they mess up...DON'T PAY. As I said before, a stylist is there to perform a service. If you went to a restaurant and had a horrible experience, rude waitress, bad food, etc, would you pay? I wouldn't. Be open, but be somewhat demanding at the same time. </P>
<P>I have like a million more, but for now those 10 will have to do. Oh, one more...THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT!!</P>
<P>**You're stylist is a person, she or he has a life outside of hair. Sometimes they are having a bad day but have to feign happiness cause their stupid boss says that's what has to happen. Don't ruin someone's day, try and be nice if you're stylist is at least giving it his or her all. (Which is what they should be doing.) If you yell, or are rude, it can ruin someone's whole week. (This has happened to me before because that ass didn't know that he wanted an army cut.)**</P>
<P>I'm off for now, I'm going to attempt to get my Harry Potter book tomorrow...mainly because I used to work at the bookstore but I have a feeling I might have to wait till Saturday. Either way I'm sure my whole day Saturday will be filled with me flipping the pages of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Can't wait!!</P>"

<P>I know what would make me happy. Well, what would make my life more enjoyable, and therefore my mind points this to happy. See, I hate basically every aspect of my life right now. Job sucks, I seriously want the building to blow up, that way I wouldn't have to go in. The people I work with were cool, but now they're just getting annoying. Well, just the one but she's the boss and blah blah blah. I'm just sick of it. And something my brother said to me when he was home seriously depressed me. Or maybe it just pissed me off. He and I went up to Gram's and on the way there he asked me my plans for the summer. Well, I don't get a fucking vacation (thanks whore! I already had one planned, but it's not like I've got anything to do instead of doing your shit or anything) so that leaves work, yeah I would rather cut of my hand, thanks. But then he asked my plans for the next year or something like that. So I told him, ""I still want to go to that school, it's really the only thing I want."" His response really hit a nerve. He said, ""Well if you start saving now, in like three years you should be there."" If I'm at this job for three years, I will die. I'll probably drive off a cliff or something. What people don't get about me is I can hide my feeling EXTREMELY well. It's a burden. Honestly, I get pissed off and just want to scream, but because of the person that I have grown up to be, I just get crabby and cry to myself when nobody is watching. Gregg just really got to me. I guess I just don't understand why I should actually have to work to get to my dreams when he's basically had it handed to him. Not even that, just that our parents back him 110% and then they look at me and force me to go to a school I never wanted to go to, and now I'm paying for that shit. AND I'm at a job that I couldn't possibly loathe more at the moment.</P>
<P>All I can think of today is that I will turn 22 next week. The best thing that could happen would be for everyone to just completely ignore it. What I want I will NEVER get. Sure, a car would be nice, or even a laptop. (NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.) But what I truly want is just for my Mom to walk into my room and say, why don't you apply to that school? It's time you do something for you. But that will never happen. For some reason all of my family members want me to be unhappy. I'm so fucking sick of it. Can't they notice how I barely come out of my room anymore? Can't they notice how depressed I am anymore? Sure some days are better than others, but I guess they can't notice. Like I said...I'm REALLY good at hiding my true feelings. I'm just afraid that one day I'm going to wake up and just not get out of bed. Just lay there. Not talk to anybody, not even show signs of life. Just because there's no other answer. Because laying in bed all day dreaming of what could have been is so much more enjoyable than anything I have to do in my actual life.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong, I know I could be a lot worse off. But I have nothing to even look forward to anymore. I don't even have a car to temporarily get me away. God I hate being a girl. <FONT size=1>(Ya know, once a month everything comes to a crashing halt, and the things that get to me on a regular basis seem like 100 times worse.)</FONT> Lost is on tonight. My one outlet that I still have. Ugh. I really don't enjoy being like this. I'm going to go lay down. Maybe take a nap. </P>"

But it was also probably the best salad I've had in a long long time. Also, cheese fries. Cause I couldn't be completely healthy, now could I? Good dinner, and damn it if Gatorade doesn't make Propel in Grape. I have&nbsp;a new drink of choice...now I just have to find the right alcohol to mix with it. Something's making me lean towards rum...maybe a little Jack Daniels. I love Jack. Maybe I'll go see how Jack is doing now...I just might. </P>"

"event","<P>So yeah...finally a day off work...and BTW every second I spend there just makes me wish the place would spontaneously com-bust during the night.</P>
<P>*Offtopic* Did you know that I can tie a cherry stem with my tongue like <EM>rilly</EM> fast?</P>
<P>OK, so first off...two weekends ago I was in New Jersey for my cousin's reception. She was married in New Mexico in April and this was the 'East Coast Reception'. (No kidding, that's what the invitation said.) Honestly? I wasn't looking forward to it. It was like a couple hour drive and I'm not used to spending time with my immediate family let alone the extended family so I was less than thrilled to be going. That is, until we got there. Well, I didn't realize how much I haden't seen my family until I got out of the car. I started talking to and seeing people that I haven't seen in years, months, etc. Plus there was a keg of Yuengling and that just made my heart smile. I drank A LOT. Therefore I don't really remember a lot of the conversations or basically anything past like 8:00. But I saw the pictures and I was smiling a lot and I know I had fun.</P>
<P>Last weekend: I rented a car (Please don't get me started on that, I just had a drink and I have a good buzz going...I don't want to ruin it.) and drove to West Chester to visit my girl Crissy who's working there for the summer. I got there Saturday night and we just stayed in cause I had been working since 9 and then spent 3 hours driving, I was tired. We had some beer and went to sleep. Next day we shopped and decided we were going&nbsp;out that night. So we go to pick up Ally and go to this house. A guy Crissy and Ally work with was house sitting and we were invited there. After I think a little over an hour we leave. It's time for the bar. We walk in and I see one of Gregg's (my brother) frat brothers'. Talked to Jon for awhile and after a trip to the bathroom we started drinking. So we've had a few and I get the brilliant idea to do Yeager Bombs. *OK, that&nbsp;may be spelled wrong** They didn't have red bull so we did Car Bombs. (I was scared, last time I did a car bomb it really wasn't pretty...hahaha.) But that was fun and I needed another bathroom break. I turn and walk away from Crissy and Ally and I get two steps from them when this really cute guy looks me directly in the eyes and puts his arm around me. He was hot, so I just stood there. Immediately this guy starts rubbing my arm and he's like making small talk. THen he bring out the line, ""Do you moisturize?"" Now, besides wanting to laugh in his face I was thinking, <EM>what kind of line is that</EM>? However, I was drinking and quite frankly when I drink my mind and my mouth don't work on the same page so my response was, ""I'm a Cosmetologist, I know what I'm doing."" Yeah, I feel like a genius typing this right now. But this story is about to get much better... (Well, it did for me.) SO the guy with his arm around me points to his friend and says, ""Look at this guy, he's a GQ model."" I look at the guy. He looks like he could definitely be a GQ model. Chiseled features, tall...the works. And I guess I looked less than impressed cause next thing I know he's pulled his shirt up showing me his very <EM>very</EM> nice abs. (I even got to touch!) Guy #1 (first guy) says he's the model's manager. My response: Sure you are. He tells me, ""I am! I'm his manager. AND his trainer."" I say, ""Yeah right."" So this guy pulls his shirt up. And I already mentioned I was attracted to the guy. He wasn't the model, but the model wasn't my type. The first guy was just really cute...totally my type. When he pulled his shirt up, I have NEVER seen abs like those in person. Like holy shit. The guy was hot. So that's my little story. It makes me happy.</P>
<P>One last thing that has nothing to do with anything I already typed. And I apologize because this may come off a bit racist, however please understand that I really don't give a damn what race you are. If you are going to come to me to get your hair cut. Please don't come in and when I ask what you want your response is, ""Sot."" (No that is NOT mis-typed.)&nbsp;IT took me like 5 seconds (which is surprising for me) before I realized he said 'Short'. Yeah. OK. Next question. Scissors or clippers? His response, ""I don't know."" Ugh, OK. I start with scissors, cause ya know...you can always go shorter. I am almost done when one of the other girls starts doing a clipper cut. This is when the guy decides what I am doing isn't what he wants. Like, I've been cutting your hair for 15 minutes, SAY SOMETHING ASS! Seriously, he walked out and I was muttering to myself the rest of the day, <FONT size=1>LEARN SOME DAMN ENGLISH</FONT>! OK, sorry about that but ya know, it pissed me off. </P>
<P>I'm done, have a nice night. (Viva La Bam is on, and it's new!! Yay!! Good lord, I need a life.)</P>"

<P>So not very much to update anyone on...um...Job still sucks, but I am giving myself a Birthday gift (B-Day is July 21st if anyone cares) of $100 to apply to my school. How am I going to get to LA with all of my shit? Who am I going to room with? No clue to both of those amongst many other questions, all I know is that if I don't at least have that little glimmer of hope to actually get out of this town that is just hell then I'll die in about 5 minutes. I hate it here. I always joke with my Rae that she and I are going straight to hell. But seriously, I can't see how it could be very much worse than the town I live in right now. Sure, it was fun until I was like 10 and realized that Barbie's weren't all the world had to offer. Wish me luck...</P>
<P>Still no car. There was one that was a possibility but then I found out it was a Dodge, and I'm sorry but I have yet to meet a Dodge that I didn't want to take an axe to. Honestly...Makes me shiver.</P>
<P>Going away for the 4th of July!! Yay!!! Going to visit my Crissy. I'm leaving Saturday at like 6:30 or later. Then I'm sure I'll bullshit around for another half hour or so. But I will be packing tomorrow. SO EXCITED!!! All I know is that I plan on being <STRONG>VERY</STRONG> drunk for those days I'm with her. Should be MAJOR fun!!</P>

"event","<P>Let's start with last Thursday. Actually no, let's start at the beginning of the week. I woke up Sunday with this headache that was just not right. It wasn't from drinking or anything, just a bloody headache that was already ruining my day. I was all set to go to church cause ya know, every once in a while I want to go to clean my slate and perhaps one day I'll get out of hell. So far it's a one way ticket though...ah well. So my Mom suggests I stay home cause the incense at church bothers me on good days and the fact that I already have a headache means I should really stay home. The rest of that day was fine. I went ot the Beauty Supply place with my Kimmy and we bought way too much nail polish and such. But then she left me. I was sad but she left Miller and he's been my buddy ever since.</P>
<P>Monday, nothing. Work. blah.</P>
<P>Tuesday and Wednesday were my days 'off'. But all I did was run everywhere.</P>
<P>Then bloody Thursday. Oh hell, it was a doosie. I had to work 11-7. Usually hours are 10-4 on a Thursday for me. Our manager was away so everyone's hours were a little effed up. It's cool, whatever. But now I'm getting to the point where work sucks. The place is fine, the people I work with (for the most part) are really cool and I like them. But I don't want to do hair, I never wanted to do hair, and I'm now looking at this job for a long time cause I have no fucking money, no way of keeping any, and just for shits and giggles...no fucking backbone to say, ""No you can't have any of my money even though you're in a bind&nbsp;cause you never pay me back."" Sorry for that rant, where was I? Oh yeah...work. So I work longer hours and I totally hate getting out of there after like 5 cause it just seems a lot later if I'm there after 5 unless I'm closing. But I suck it up and finally after watching the clock all damn day it's 7 and I get to leave. I start cleaning up my shit, I clock out and I go to check my phone. (I do this everyday...just making sure I don't have to stop anywhere on my way home to run an errand or anything.) My phone tells me I have 5 picture messages. This is a girl who has probably gotten a total of 5 picture messages since she got her phone. And that was about a year and a half ago. I figure it a friend that just got bored and go clean up the rest of my crap. The whole time I'm thinking about my phone cause I never get picture messages. I decide to open the last one just to see who it's from and what's going on. Here's what I see. (I really hope this works, if you can't see the picture, i'm sorry.)</P>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink><A href=""javascript:Ui.MiniViewer.showViewer(Model.Current.pictureIndex);""><IMG class=ygpImageBorder height=131 src=""http://pstr-m01.ygpweb.aol.com/data/02B/1F/38/E0/1E/zVitiW-HdTsAZoSnm5bSId-VDdMZIvwL00A0.jpg"" width=160></A></DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>That would be Gregg's (my brother) Chevy Blazer with the roof partially caved in. I freaked out. My brain like just shut down. I didn't realize it was my brother that had in fact sent me the picture. So my mouth like falls to the floor and my hand smacks me in the face and my eyes grow to like 5 times their normal size. And I stare at this picture being perfectly still in this position for like 10 seconds before I start to feel this dread in my stomach and that little burn behind my eyes that always promises' tears. I grab my shit and practically run out of the salon. I'm not even out the door and I'm dialing my brother's cell. It rings and I'm to&nbsp;the car when he picks up. I don't wait for him to say ""Hello"" I just blurt out, ""ARE YOU OK? Oh my god what the hell happened?"" His response? ""Hang on, my car made the news."" My eyes roll and I realize then that he's OK. (I'm that person that after all is said and done, I'll cry.) For like half a second I think I'm gonna burst into tears, but only like two come out. </DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>The story: Gregg was leaving his apartment traveling in one lane and a woman was turning. She crossed 2 or 3 (I can't remember) lanes and hit him. She hit him right in front of the driver side rear tire. He flips, ending up on the roof. Still facing the way he was traveling, just upside down. He unbuckles his seat belt and lowers himself onto the ceiling so he can crawl out of the window. His injuries? A cut on his finger. He was wearing his seat belt, and if he haden't been then&nbsp;this journal would&nbsp;have a very different story. And I would be a VERY depressed young woman. I still get chills thinking of what could've been. It was a phase 3 accident, which means he has to go to the hospital. He climbs into the ambulance and gets his oxygen. He's OK, I'm allowed to breathe. </DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>So we figure, it's obviously the woman's fault, her insurance should be able to pay for the rental he'll need to get around and eventually come home. (He's due in tomorrow as a matter of fact.) Well, we wait a couple days and there's no police report yet. Finally we get it and NUMBER 1...the cop has the written portion all fucked up. He claims that Gregg was traveling towards where the woman actually was, and the woman traveling towards where Gregg actually was. Saying Gregg pulled out in front of her, and nobody was cited. HEY FUCKING MORON COP IN IOWA...IF THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED, THEN SHE WOULD HAVE HIT MY BROTHER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND HE WOULD HAVE HAD MAJOR INJURIES. YOU BASTARD FUCK! So there's a diagram too. Only the diagram has them like a street over and none of the street names are correct for where the accident happened. SO NUMBER 2 The cop has two stories in his own fucking report. NUMBER 3. (This one really fucking pisses me off!) The woman's story: ""I don't remember where I was going. I don't remember who I was with. I don't remember what happened. I don't remember what car I was in."" HEY YOU FUCKING WHORE, GET THE STORY OUT THE RIGHT WAY YOU COULD HAVE KILLED MY BROTHER YOU BITCH! My Mom makes the mistake of saying it could be a scam and I'm ready to fucking walk to Iowa and kick some serious ass. </DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>My brother,&nbsp;SO being his Mother's son and making me oh-so proud writes up his version of the story. Complete with his own diagram. It's 4 pages long. (My brother is so awesome.) He send it to wherever and decides that he'll catch a flight home since he's obviously not driving. My Mom finds him a cheap flight from Chicago to Pittsburgh and my Dad said he'd drive there to get him. Meanwhile this dude goes to look at the Blazer decided that it IS totaled and Gregg will get like $6,000 for it. Or I guess for another car. He even threw in $300 cause of the 6-disk CD player. Cool. </DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=ygpPictureLink>So that's been my week. I've drank&nbsp;A LOT of Yuengling this week. But man was it good. It's just been hectic and I know in the next few weeks it'll be one of those, 'my life is pointless I hate everything, I would be better off if my parents had never had a second child."" Yeah, I can always feel those coming on and I just don't want to deal with it but it's so on it's way. I wrote a lot today. I'm going to bed cause I gotta work tomorrow. (Back to my 10-4...and Gregg's coming home!! Yay!) Take it easy...</DIV>

I just got on to my school webpage (the school is Cinema Makeup School) and was all ready to look around when I realized that I haven't applied. So I pull out my checkbook to see if I have ove $100 and no, I don't. So I look at why I don't. (I have like $80 in there.) What's this? Wine & Spirits, for $25? I only spent $8 on my stuff...that's right; Mom & Dad haven't paid me back yet. Gas for $20? I Don't buy gas. RIGHT! Went to use the car and it was BELOW empty. Forgot I filled that up. Then there's the hair stuff that my Mom uses. Now I'm getting pissed. So what's a girl to do? Well, if I had a car, I would take my $75 in tip money (for three days, go me!!) and put it in the bank so I could apply. BUT I DON'T HAVE A FUCKING CAR. Yeah, that fucking Intrepid is in the driveway, but my neck is already kinda bugging me and every time I drive that I just have to lightly touch the gas and I get freakin' whiplash. So yeah...not a happy camper right now. 

I tried to lay out today. That didn't work. First I was going to, but Rae and I decided to go out to lunch, which I'm happy about cause I got out of my house without the use of the shit-mobile. But after lunch I went ot lay out. Honestly? Not even out there for 10 minutes and I start sneezing. 30 Minutes later I'm like running inside cause I can't breathe. But I stuck it out and was in the sun for like maybe 45 minutes. Still pale as ever. I need to move. You know, more than one doctor has suggested I move to Arizona where there is no pollen or grass or shit. Well, I'm not up for Arizona, but I think the other Coast might be a good idea. Well, I'm going to try to clean out the underneath of my sink cause it's like mega-gross. (And what the hell, I'll clean the shit behind the mirror too. BLAH!

She'll be about four hours away, but I like to drive. :) I bought lots today, but I think I finally may have enough work clothes for now. I was always the jeans, tee-shirt and sweatshirt girl. Now I have to wear dress pants, nice shirts, skirts, the works. I had to move my closet all around. I'm done spending large sums of money for now. Yesterday I spent quite a lot in 2 different places, and today it was just the one place, but still quite a lot. As I see it, I should be able to start saving for a car now, and as soon as I have a car, my fears will die down a bit. I mean if I don't know that I'm gonna make it the 2 minutes it takes me to get to work, then there's no way the car will make it to where I need/want to go. Yes, it's a plan...in my mind. It will work eventually. But for now I'm going to go play a little Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 cause I just got it the other day and I'm rocking as Bam Margera."

"event","So Lost ended like half an hour ago. It was amazing. Blew my damn mind. I laughed, I screamed, I cried (Cause I'm a putz) and it was just really good and pissed me off which made it even better. (Send help!) But I will not elaborate cause I don't want to give anything away.

So onto another completely different subject. I don't like many people, and the ones I do like are really starting to 'skate on thin ice.' Not everyone, mainly the ones I live with, and a few others. Here's the deal. If you lie to me, I FUCKING FIND OUT. I don't care if it's something huge like a damn promise that I totally believed and just never came true (and will never see the light of day again), or if it's something as stupid as going to a movie and completely lying to my face about it. I just don't understand. I'm a completely understanding person. But fuck you if you lie. I can carry a grudge bigger than a fucking jumbo jet. And I will. Can someone explain to me why some little lie is told, blatantly to my face? It is in no way protecting me. If anything, it just pisses me off cause somebody wanted to turn something that could've taken two minutes to discuss into some huge thing. Not that I'm surprised, this isn't the first time it has happened. Let me just put it this way. I'm fucking done with people walking all over me. I'm a fucking human being. Nobody is going to hurt me anymore, I am the one in charge of my own destiny. However, I am not in charge of the fucking air temperature in my house which is about 200 degrees. I'm burning up here. 

Blah I'm done. I know what's happening, and soon. I'm leaving. When I come back I know what I'll be and I know who I'll know and what I will have achieved. And every last person who ever tried to fuck me over will be so damn jealous that they won't be able to sleep at night. There is a reason that I have gone through everything that has happened. There is a reason that I am here when he died, when I know he would have been greater at his life than I am at mine. But not for long. Soon I will make the most of my life. I know I'm better than this, and that I'm better than (a lot) of people that surround me. If you haven't noticed, I'm a fucking rock. I'm not gonna break, and if you don't watch out you're going to have me as an enemy. I don't deal nicely with people who lie right to my fucking face, looking me in the eye. By the way, I knew that night but I was giving the benefit of the doubt, should have known better. History repeats itself, and nobody changes unless they want to change. Too bad this particular person doesn't get how much it hurts when that knife goes into my back time and time again. That wound has been opened so many times that the littlest things now make it bleed like new. It makes me sad cause I get really close to people and then I try and keep up this great friendship, but somehow I am always the one who gets shit on. I'm done. I'm done caring too much. If you treat me like shit, fuck off. If you treat me like a person, I'll love you forever and you will be repaid for your humanity one day, I promise."

"event","So I totally adore Dominic Monaghan. (The hobbit Merry, Charlie on Lost amongst other roles.) To the point: I love this actor. Yes, I find him attractive but I honestly find him amazing in his career. So when he's on TV I usually tune in with a fit of giddiness I just can't control. Well, last week I knew that Dom would be on Jay Leno tonight. I wrote it down and lost the paper sometime over the weekend. Yesterday I remembered and wrote it on the back of my reminder to do my 5 loads of laundry and when the laundry was done, I threw out the paper. Haven't thought about it until now. Because my brother is THE BEST. He just called me and said, ""Hey, are you watching Jay Leno?"" And I loudly stated, ""SHIT!"" Because my brian temporarily stopped working. See he's an hour ahead and so I figured I had missed Dom! But he kindly reminded me that Jay Leno was on at the same time, not an hour ahead and I had not, in fact, missed Dom. Yes, my brother is the best. In his words, 'That's what brother's are for."" In my words, ""I freaking love my brother so much right now!"""

"event","So work last night was actually busy. Yeah, a Monday night that's NEVER EVER EVER busy was totally cramped. At least it went fast. Then I got home at like 9:30 and went for pizza and beer cause neither my rents or myself had eaten yet and it was special at Zach's. So when I got home I was tired and went to bed. But then I got up and had to piddle every like 20 mins cause I drank a lot of beer. Well, it was a lot compared to anything I've been drinking lately. (That would be nothing.) 

So I slept in till 11 today (go me!!) and when I got up I had like 5 loads of laundry to do so I got right to it. Then I called my girl in Florida and wished her a Happy 21st Birthday, hopefully I get that present out tomorrow cause if I don't I'm DOOMED!! (It will probably end up being the DOOMED predicament.) So I got my check and put a bunch of money in the bank then went and got crap that I needed desperately. AT least I still have more in the checkbook than I started out with today. Then I decided my friend that I cannot live without who is leaving me and I needed a Johnny Depp night. (She's not really leaving me, I'm moving with her...as much as I can.) So I rented Finding Neverland and Benny and Joon. Both really good movies. Finding Neverland is a bit of a cry-er. So Beware. Other than a fun night with Crissy, nothing much happened today except laundry. And I like half-made dinner. Meaning I started it and put crap in the oven. Go me. 

Now I'm just typing so I don't have to clean. but I really should. My room looks downright dreadful. Oh well. A few mor errands tomorrow sometime and then Lost tomorrow night. SO EXCITED!!"

"event","So today I worked 10-5 and it went faster than any other day I've ever worked. I guess it was because we were busy and I barely had room to even think. Then I came home and my second cousins had brought their granddaughter in. She's almost 9 months. She's adorable, and apparently she loves me cause for the two hours I got to spend with my family she didn't leave me alone. But she is so cute and so pleasant that I didn't really care.

Next week I'll go back to my normal schedule at work. I've decided that it is time to apply to my school. Well, as soon as I have an extra $100. Hopefully I'll get a good loan and a good roommate and I can finally stop being all depressed cause I am not living up to my full potential. (Or whatever.) Oh well. We'll see if I get my loan, unfortunately if I don't then I wont' be able to go...I have no means to pay the $12,000+. Yeah, lots of money. However it could easily be a lot more."

"event","So it's been a month...but nobody read this so it's ok.

Work is going pretty good. I figured out that I should get at least $200 per paycheck. That's after taxes and insurance is taken out. Plus at least $50 in tips each week, so that's $100 per two weeks. And I get paid every two weeks. So in my little mind I figure I'll get about $600 per month. The only bill I have is phone which is about $40 since Mom and I are on one now and that's great cause it made my bill go lower by almost $20. The only thing now is my credit card bill. That's gonna take some time though cause I want to save money too. I figure I'll be able to put like $300 per month on my credit card bill...but I'll probably only do $200. The bill is high cause I went for a full year without a job and still managed to pay for my own shit, don't know how I did it with no income but oh well. 

As far as school goes...I have contacted the school with some questions on loans and apartments and roommates. I figure I'll start there either September 12th or October 25th. Whichever one is more doable. And if I'm still here by November then something bad will happen and I will never be happy again. (Dark much? geez.) 

Today was weird. Last night I decided that I would rent the whole Star Wars stuff and watch them again cause friend Rae and I are going at Midnight to see Episode Three. But I got up at 10 and while getting dressed my Dad called and Uncle Jim needed help at ye ole print shoppe. So I went there. Well three hours late I had an extra $40 bucks so that's not bad. In other news I have to go up tomorrow and don't want to cause Tuesday's and Wednesday's are supposed to be my days off. Plus this week I'm working more hours cause co-worker girl is on vacation. Oh well, I need the money...BADLY.

I have come to a realization over the past few months that makes me really sad. I used to be super close with about 10 girls. Through college and such it has dwindled down to about 4 that I'm still tight with. Out of those 4, one is leaving for France till the end of June, one I'm going to be bugging all Summer, and unfortunately, a friendship is drifting apart from another. From my end it seems as if she doesn't need me cause I've been replaced with another. And if you're reading this, I'm not trying to hurt you or anything, it's just something I've noticed and I love you very much, but I get like this and we aren't as close as we once were. It just makes me sad. 

I'm also really kind of scared about going to california by myself. I guess I had myself convinced that my one friend would go with me but when I mentioned something about it tonight she told me she didn't have the money. Not that I do, I'll only be going if I get the loan, but according to the school I should get it. I wonder if I could get any money from the surgery shit I went through. I should get something for not being able to live a real life for like 3+ years. Yeah, still not over that, but still working on my little story too. 

I miss my brother a lot right now and I don't know why. Maybe cause I know in a little over a month he'll be home, I don't know. I realized today that in a little over two months I'll be 22. Still living with my parents and still not following my dreams. That is why I said earlier that if I'm not out of here by November happiness will never find me. It's depressing, I know but I'm listening to Whiskey Lullaby right now and can think no happy thoughts. I'm going ot go to sleep now. Hopefully this mood will be gone when I wake up. If not maybe I'll have time to watch a CKY DVD or something, that would make me happy. I almost smiled when I thought of watching it!

Oh yeah!! New Lost tonight!!"

"event","Remember how I got a job? Well, I've already handed in my resignation. What can I say? I hated the Cosmetology school I went to and this was even worse. But I figure for all 4 days I worked I should get close to one hundred dollars after taxes and all. Which is good cause I'm broke and I keep buying things that I can't pay for. (Not expensive things, but still...) Let's just say that it was managed horribly and I have a feeling that all chains of this certain salon are handled the same way, which is why they aren't really well known. That, and the place was dirty. I know I may have clothes and shit thrown around my room, but it's not dirty. Like, yeah the clothes might need washed but there's no dust, the carpet is clean. As far as actual dirt goes, none in my room cause I can't stand it. Therefore, I can't work in a place that is dirty. And 'first job' was DEFINITELY one of those yucky places. However, I agreed to work tomorrow around 5ish and Saturday cause I have no backbone. That and they still have my license which I need to get back, pronto.

If you remember, I put 2 applications in and only one called back so I took that (dirty) job. So when I realize I hate it there and will not stay there even if I have no income and have to live in a car, the other place calls and wants to give me a chance. I interview with them and it goes really well. On Tuesday I had my second interview and that went well. (I had to do 1 male and 1 female haircut.) The woman that could be my boss is very nice. She told me she'd call in a few days then we could set up a time so I could come in and fill out paperwork. Now, she didn't say, ""Welcome, you're hired,""  but with what she said I think I have a fairly good shot at being hired, but I don't know how many others have applied. So wish me luck on that cause that place isn't dirty, and it's just soooooo much better.

Other than that, nothing's new. Bought 2 CD's today. (Don't yell, I had like 5 in my hand, I'm surprised I got it down to 2.) And may I just recommend to anyone who likes John Mayer or music anything like his, Tyler Hilton is amazing. I love this CD!!! SO GOOD! 

One more thing, I'm afraid that as I get older I'm gonna be one of those people who loses their memory like every 5 seconds. Case in point, I just threw a load of laundry in. I start the water and begin to throw the whites in and when I finish that I shut the lid and start upstairs. At the top stair I realize I forgot to put freaking detergent in. At least I remembered. I wonder if my surgeries could possibly have some sort of effect on memory, cause I used to be great at remembering numbers or that someone called, or to call someone back, simple things like that. Now it's like 4 days later I remember. Even when I write shit down anymore, I don't remember when I left the damn paper. Oh well."

But I had my first day on Friday and I HATED IT!! It was exactly like the school I went to and I hated that soooo badly. So I get into this hissy Friday when I get back from my first day and I just like stayed away from everyone. So blah, right? Well then today I am laying down cause I got EXTREMELY nauseous. Like, my sinuses were draining and my allergies were attacking me and all that good crap. So I'm laying there finally resting a bit. The phone rings, my Dad screams for me. I get on the phone and...it's the woman from the job I originally wanted. They want an interview. This is my life. It hands me shit and then taunts me with something that could be potentially good. So she wants the interview to happen tomorrow night at 5:30. Well that won't work, I'm supposed to be at the new job I hate at 6. So We reschedule for Friday at 9. (Yes, in the morning.) So yeah, that's my life right now. In the mean time I'm just waiting to get whatever job I end up with and get a car and start saving some money and getting my credit card down some and blah blah blah. So I started looking for apartments because in September I'm planning on moving to LA. (For a school.) So there's that. And that's where I'm going to leave it for now.

"event","So about 2 or 3 years ago when I went to about 8 places and put in my application and really wanted a job and could really use the money nobody offered. Now that I really don't want a job and have absolutely no drive to go get one, I get like 3 places that I'm supposed to call. (My school helps graduates get jobs.) So I decided today was the day to try, cause at least I got out of my house. I called the first place that I knew used Matrix (product line) and I really like Matrix and that's why I use so I thought that would be cool. Well, they don't want someone right out of school, they want someone that has their own clientele. (Pretty much people who already go to someone on a weekly, or monthly basis.) Well, that was a bust. Then I called the second place the woman from my school told me about. The girl wasn't there, I said I'd call back later. However, my Mom found an article in the paper and while it wouldn't be my first choice, they offer insurance, paid vacation, 401k, I mean the works. I went in and met about 4 of the girls working there. Seems like an OK place. Plus it's really not far from my house at all. I put in my application. I just now called the one from earlier and she said that I could come in and get an application. So I'll stop sometime tomorrow and we'll see how this one goes. I might have a job. But I don't want one.

I've been feeling very not-good lately. It started with my stomach being very upset. I thought it was just my time to feel like shit for the month, but no. So then my head started. I hate getting sick. Mainly because my head takes it personal. I was sick for so long with my main symptom being a headache that now when I get sick my head's all like, 'Hey, I don't think so, if you're gonna be sick it's gonna be because of me, BITCH!' Yeah, my head's nasty like that. But my stomach finally stopped hurting. But my head hurts like whoa. Yeah. Sucks. Big. Time.

But hey, maybe I'll get a job I don't want and then in turn get some money that I really, really want. (And need oh-so-badly.)"

Don't hit it, don't swear and threaten to beat a family member to death, for I know from experience that these things don't work. Just call me because the fact that I know nothing about printers does not mean that I can't fix them. And I'm talking take the cover off and playing around INSIDE the printer. (A.K.A. Unknown territory.) I think I'll still embark the code I have not yet named. In short, nobody's allowed to touch my computer (printer, etc.) unless they have permission from me and I can stand over their shoulder and bark commands at them. Cause that'd be fun.

My music style seem to be changing. I went from Pop (A-la *NSYNC and Britney Spears) to country (Brad Paisley and Keith Urban) and right now the music is The Killers and Simple Plan. The Killers I understand. It's a good band, fairly new (at least to me) I mean I loved Somebody told me when it first came out but then I heard nothing from the band for a long, long time. Then I saw the video for Mr. Brightside and decided I wanted the CD. The rest is history. I love the CD I recommend it to all. But Simple Plan I don't get. I liked Addicted. I really liked that song. But how long ago was that? I mean the rest of their songs were good, I mean I wouldn't change the station if they came on or whatever. But ever since I listened to the words to Welcome To My Life, I bought the CD and now I love it. There's a song called Jump on there that is just me in a nut shell. The song makes me laugh cause it's just soooo how I feel. Especially this verse:

I don't wanna wake up one day
And find out it's too late
To do all the things I wanna do
So I'm gonna pack up my bags
I'm never coming back
'Cuz the years are passing by
And I'm wasting all my time.

Heh, kinda deep but it makes me laugh cause at times I just feel like this soooo badly. Now back to The Grim Grotto."

But I went to Sam's Club today cause my glasses have had this weird shit on them that totally isn't a scratch at all and you know it when you look at them.

My glasses are over 2 years old and yeah, I need a new pair but guess what, I don't have the like $200 for an appointment and new frames cause mine probably aren't there anymore and blah, blah, blah. So I went in and told them that my glasses had some stuff on them that wasn't a scratch and I showed the girl and she totally understood. I guess they put a protective coating of some sort on to help and it started to wear off. So they just took it off and I have glasses again and I'm happy cause it was free and I can be on my computer for more than 10 minutes now without getting a headache.

"event","It's been a little while since I've updated, for various reasons. The number one reason being my computer just about died. I've had this program on my computer that I was completely unable to get rid of. My brother was home and he thought it would be a good idea to put the whole program back into my computer then try to delete it because apparently I was able to delete half of it awhile ago. Well, as soon as that got in my computer everything was taking about 10 minutes to open. (This is no joke! I timed it twice.) Well, brother wasn't here long enough to figure out what had to be done cause he had to go back to school. So it was up to me. Oddly enough my patience was working quite well. I tried to remove the program. No dice. I then moved a bunch of shit from the C drive to the D drive. Then I restarted the computer and let it sit for about half an hour. I decided it was time to try removing the horrid program again. IT WORKED! SO my computer's back...and I think it's even a tiny bit better than before. All my music is now on the D drive and my computer is a bit faster. (I'm just happy it's not dead.)

So, last time I wrote I was bitching about the Cosmetology License. I wrote my e-mail's on February 28th. I got news back from the lady at my old school the next day. (Surprised the hell outta me...but she told me the other woman would be calling soon...that has yet to happen.) And the State Board? Yeah, NOTHING. SO I decide I'll call. But of course the first time I can't even find a way to get to an operator. You would think dial the number, then like the 0? No, that takes you to state law shit which I really wasn't looking for. The following day I try again. OK, 3 minutes later I finally get to the part where there should be someone on the other line. What do I hear? Nobody is able to take your call. Click. WTF? Oh...it was a Saturday...I guess I'll try again on Monday. And that's what I do. This past Monday around 12:30 I call. Spend 3 minutes again but this time I write down the 2 buttons I must push after the number. I have to do this 4 times before I get somebody. See, they don't have the whole, someone will be with you in a minute. It says that once then comes on and says nobody can take your call. Click. But I pushed on and finally got a real live person. I talk to her, just ask why I haven't received my license. She looks it up. Doesn't give me an answer. She just says that she'll issue it today and it will be sent out tomorrow. (Tuesday.) I say ok, thanks and we hang up. Then it occurs to me, wait a minute. She's only gonna issue it today. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN 6 DAMN WEEKS AGO BITCH! But I'm not about to call back and say, hey by the way why do you guys suck so much? So I let it go. And if I don't have my license by next Thursday (oh, one week from today) there will be SUCH SHIT to pay. 

Other than that nothing new. Besides the fact that I finally listened to the words of that Simple Plan song 'Welcome to My Life' and I LOVE IT! I dunno, when I heard it I was having a little pity party for myself in that car I hate. But the lyrics were like in my head already...Here the lyrics, then my thoughts in parenthesis.

Do you ever feel like breaking down?       (Absolutely, in fact that sounds good for right now.)
Do you ever feel out of place?             (Besides all the time? No.)
Like somehow you just don't belong         (Is it every day or every other that I curse this State?)
And no one understands you                 (Well, yeah but I just figured they weren't listening...)
Do you ever wanna runaway?                 (HA! When you search your room for only the things you 'need'?)
Do you lock yourself in your room?         (Not so much lock as just shut the door and never come out.)
With the radio on turned up so loud        (I suppose a good CD means the same thing?)
That no one hears you screaming            (Well, screaming on the inside, yeah.)

No you don't know what it's like           (Yes, I do.)
When nothing feels all right               (All the time.)
You don't know what it's like              (I already said I do.)
To be like me                              (To be like me.)

To be hurt                                 (By everyone.)
To feel lost                               (I don't belong here.)
To be left out in the dark                 (Why is it that nobody fills me in anymore?)
To be kicked when you're down              (You mean when people piss me off at the entirely wrong time?)
To feel like you've been pushed around     (Being told to 'Get a job' instead of achieving my dreams.)
To be on the edge of breaking down         (All the time.)
When no one's there to save you            (**looks around** Nobody's here.)
No you don't know what it's like           (No you don't.)
Welcome to my life                         (Amen.)

Do you wanna be somebody else?             (""With someone else's soul, someone else's face""~Bon Jovi)
Are you sick of feeling so left out?       (So damn sick of it.)
Are you desperate to find something more?  (Desperate doesn't even begin to define it.)
Before your life is over                   (Haven't I put my life on hold long enough? You only live once.)
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?     (More like the State I hate, but still.)
Are you sick of everyone around?           (Well, not EVERYONE. Just most.)
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies (OMG, this song is about me & the people around me.)
While deep inside you're bleeding          (Wow, deep, but yes.)
 
No you don't know what it's like           (No you don't!)
When nothing feels all right               (When you want to scream because you feel stuck.)
You don't know what it's like              (You really don't.)
To be like me                              (To be like ME.)

To be hurt                                 (When nobody will even listen to my side.)
To feel lost                               (There's nothing here for me.)
To be left out in the dark                 (Like I just don't belong.)
To be kicked when you're down              (Everything's wrong and now I owe MORE MONEY?! OMGWFT?!?)
To feel like you've been pushed around     (Why don't I just do something for ME instead of someone else?)
To be on the edge of breaking down         (I like the word 'crazy'.)
When no one's there to save you            (Again, nobody here that would even understand.)
No you don't know what it's like           (At all.)
Welcome to my life                         (You don't want to be here, do you?)
 
No one ever lied straight to your face     (I could tell you shit for HOURS. About ONE person.)
No one ever stabbed you in the back        (I could tell you shit for HOURS. About ONE person.)
You might think I'm happy                  (Or you might not.)
But I'm not gonna be okay                  (Unless I find a way out.)
Everybody always gave you what you wanted  (Stupid bitch.)
Never had to work it was always there      (Wish I had that luxury.)
You don't know what it's like              (And you never will.)
What it's like                             (To be me.)

To be hurt                                 (It hurts when you STILL have to put your life on hold.)
To feel lost                               (Sometime's I'd rather be Lost. Heh heh.)
To be left out in the dark                 (With no clue how to get hold of my life.)
To be kicked when you're down              (With no way around it.)
To feel like you've been pushed around     (By everyone.)
To be on the edge of breaking down         (Such a familiar place.)
When no one's there to save you            (But if someone were here, would I let them?)
No you don't know what it's like,          (No you don't.)
What it's like                             (At all.)

Welcome to my life [x3]                    (My guess is you're just passing through.)

So that's what happened on the radio (and in my head.) Then I thought I really shouldn't listen to that song again. But I looked up the lyrics anyway. So if anything's wrong, it totally wasn't me...it was the lyrics site. Oh yeah, that Bon Jovi quote is from the song Someday I'll Be Saturday Night. I LOVE that song. It's a great song to listen to when you're getting ready to go out. and drink. I miss my Kimmy & Lynnea!

Well I have to go buy a straightener for someone & get mousse for me cause, well I'm out. I'll update soon (I hope) or at least when I get my license. (If ever.)"

"event","Ever have one of those days where it starts out just fine but then it steadily gets worse and worse and worse until you wish you just would have stayed in bed, turned off the phone and listened to music all day? Yeah that would be what I'm feeling. Like I said, it started off just fine...

I woke up around 8:15 to a little paw scratching on my door. My puppy wanted to eat and Mom was running late for work. I got him his breakfast and went back to bed, turned on John Mayer and fell asleep. Then I slept until 10:00. Got up, ate some breakfast. (Mmm...honey bunches of oats.) Then I didn't do a whole lot for the next like two hours. I took the puppy outside, grabbed the mail, just little stuff like that. At 12:30 I fed the puppy again and decided to update my Lost tapes. (The ones with no commercials.) I had the three last episodes to do. (They were Charlie, Sawyer, and Jin.) So I started that. Got through the Charlie episode and had a huge smile on my face. (I love me some Charlie.) Then I looked at the mail and realized I got something. (Credit card bill...oh yay.) 

So the credit card bill was a bit more than I expected. *SiGh* Oh well, shit happens then ya die. So back to Lost. This is when my Dad calls. Yeah, he's in San Diego where it's warm and not snowing. Yeah, I'm the one dying to get to CA but he's the one that gets the free paid trip. (A la work.) He wants me to answer his 500 questions about the weather. I look outside and tell him, ""It's snowing, not laying on the roads."" He wants me to watch the weather channel at this time and this time and that time too. My thoughts: No...the weather channel is not fun for me. Someone I worked with once said that the weather channel is like MTV for old people. I like to think this is soooo true! So I do the usual ""uh huh"", ""mh hum"" and shit to get through the weather questions then he tells he'll call back later. 

Back to Lost, Sawyer episode still. Phone rings again. It's for my Dad. No he's not here. After I get this person's life story that I really really don't care about I get the name and number and the promise that my dad will get back to him in the next 3 days. I hang up the phone and mutter, ""I'm not his f*cking assistant. Call the damn office not his home phone."" So I'm starting to get pissed. But I get through the Sawyer episode. I actually thought of going back and watching the Carlie episode, thinking that might make me a bit happier. But I charge on...

Next up is the Jin episode, ah but the phone (of course) rings...it's for my brother. Oddly enough he doesn't even live here anymore. Hell, since he graduated in 1998 he hasen't lived here. I take that back. Between College and Chiropractic school he lived here for 2 months. They ask if he's home, I give the simple no. They give me an 800 number I 'forget' to write the number down. This time I hang up the phone with a ""WTF?!"" I seriously ponder about taking the phone off the hook. But I finally get through the Jin episode. I take my parents VCR back to their room and hook it up. Almost done and it's the damn phone again. I answer with an agitated ""Hello"", and nobody's there. I hang up the phone. ""Fuck you then."" Yeah, I'm guessing today isn't my day.

Doggie needs to go outside again. Then I decide I might as well pay the credit card now, so I look over the statement. ""WFT!"" There was a charge for $24.95 for Entertainment Weekly. I know, I know...25 bucks ain't the end of the world. But hey, it's a lot of money when you have no income and you have the credit card and phone bills to deal with. There is an 800 number that accompanies the $24.95 I never said it was ok to take. I call. Then I push about 18 buttons before I actually get a person. I explain the story and she says that I never canceled my subscription. Sorry but I did that 6 months ago and that's when the magazine stopped. Oh, I see, when I bough the best of Culture Club in a Best Buy in VA I choose the 8 free issues of Entertainment Weekly as opposed to the 8 free issues of Sports Illustrated. This make no sense to me so I tell the operator-girl that I dont' understand. Well, apparently I have the first 8 weeks to decide if I want to cancel or not. Well, that should be simple because I bought that CD on like the 15th. I tell her I want to cancel she tells me it's too late. I inform her (a little agitated) that I have not received one issue yet. She then gets the picture and puts me on hold while she cancels my subscription that I never said was ok. She comes back and tells me my credit card will get the $24.95 back. She thanks me I thank her and we hang up. I roll my eyes and swear a tiny bit. 

The phone rings. I'm starting to think of just throwing all the phone in the house outside into the snow. It's my dad. Again. He's still wondering about the weather that I didn't watch cause I was doing my Lost tape. 10 minutes later we hang up. I decide that after my bitchiness ruled the Entertainment Weekly girl then I should take care of the other business I've been putting off. The two e-mails, one of which I just didn't write and should have, and one of which I really don't want to write. At. All. First up, STate Board of Cosmetology. Short version, my license hasen't arrived. I should have gotten it over a week ago. Please send help, or at least my license number, kthnx. E-mail number two. To the owner of the Beauty school I went to. Hi, I know I should be talking to the other lady but the fact of the matte is that the school was closed today, I have to pick up my father tomorrow and brother gets home day after tomorrow. could you hook me up with a job that I don't want but desperately need? Thnx. 

Then I'm just all over pissy cause I don't want a job but I have no money and my end of the rainbow is so far away that I'm never gonna get what I want. Story of my life. I should've stayed in bed sooooo much longer. Oh look, it's the phone again. Mom's gonna be late. Hang up with her I bitch and moan and clean up the room. I tend to do that when I get cranky. Phone again! Dad again! Not much new to report on his end. Damn phone again. The car Mom took is the ultimate in cars I want to see blown up. It won't start. AT ALL. These people wonder why I hate this car to the depths of my soul? why why why??? Phone again. Oh, this one's OK. Lady wants me to stay with her teenage girls at night while she and her husband are gone. It sounds like I'll more-so be in charge of looking after the dogs, can do. Finally, I give up and vow to not answer the phone. I put John Mayer on really really loud and lay down. Soon Mom gets home...apparently she called one of the neighbors and he went out and jumped the shit-mobile. Good, now she can answer the phone for the rest of the night. 

That's it. I'm done bitching. I should've just called and left my friend a 5-minute message. Maybe I still will. At least the rest of the night shows no signs of pissing me off...yet."

"event","So last Saturday (the 12th) I left. I went to Virginia to visit my Kimmy. (And of course Lynnea and Miller too!) But I just got back yesterday and I already miss it down there. I even went as far as to see what I needed to work there...more hours than I need here or 6 months of work. Blah. I don't want a job, however I need money and therefore I'm afraid that this week may be the last 'free' week I have. As soon as I have enough money to have a car. (Let me explain what I mean by car. I mean a car for ME. Not my Dad's shitty Dodge or anything that came from my brother. I mean a car I can rely on. Preferably a Chevy. Preferably a Blazer, but at least a Chevy.) If I had a car I could get to the school I want. And they have practically let me know that almost anyone can get a loan for school and living expenses. Plus I know I can get a job out there...well I'm pretty sure I can at least get a part time job while going to school. I'm tired. I have a lot of laundry to do. I wish I was still in Chesapeake."

"event","So it's Wednesday. Yes, Lostnesday is finally here cause it's finally a new episode. Now because I am a gigantic tool, I am adding the two newest episodes of Lost onto my tapes with the commercials taken out.(Boone and Shannon dooo iiit, and Walt's a freaky-ass kid.) Seriously, I'm such a nerd for this show. Thank you Dominic Monaghan. So apparently tonight's episode is supposed to be Charlie-centric. (YAY!!)

I have nothing to do anymore. I'm waiting to get my Cosmetology license in the mail. I don't know why cause I really don't want it. (That's a whole other story.) I guess all in all it's just been a week of let's-feel-bad-for-myself-cause-I-never-get-what-I-want. Which is, in itself, very selfish, but Eff ya'll cause I'm PMSing big time and I'll just bitch about what I want. (Haha, Hurley cracks my shit up. ""Just pee on my foot, just PEEEEEE on it."")

Now I'm off to finish my Lost tape, feed my dog, and let my friend's dog's out to piddle."

"event","My Boards went well on Monday. I can't think of anything I did really wrong, or even slightly wrong. If I did fail any portion, I will only have to take (and pay) for that portion again. I'm pretty positive I passed, only I won't know for like 2 weeks. I have to wait until the State Boards receive and grade my papers from the proctor at the exam. Once they get my papers it will take 10-14 days for me to get them.  Well, that's that for now. 

So what did I decide to do on Monday night? Started researching my schools again. I need to get out of here. I'm 21, and since I've been 16 I've had my life on hold, doing anything significant for someone other than myself. That needs to stop. Or, I just need to do something really significant for me for once. So there's this cinema make up school in LA that looks A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. & I want to go there very badly. (My main love is make up and I want more than anything to work on Film and Television sets, hence the next school I wish to attend.) 

In other news, my puppy isn't doing his best. He had a seizure tonight and that sparked a fight between my mother and myself. I dunno, she's the Mom, but HE is MY baby. Or something like that. Everyone is fine now though and I have talked my parents in to taking baby boy into the Vet tomorrow. (My doggie is going to be 14 years old in February and he has cataracts, diabetes, and now apparently suffers from seizures. Did I mention he can't hear well?) But he's the best, and he runs this house. I'm gonna go cry now. No, I'm just going to go to sleep. Maybe when I wake up everything will be different. I do promise (mostly to myself) to work on my 'sob' story so that can get out."

"event","So last Monday (Jan 17th) I took the Theory portion of my Cosmetology Boards. This was the actual written test, or in this case, the computerized multiple choice test. (Congratulate me, I passed!!) Which means that tomorrow (Jan 24th) I get to take the Practical portion. This one I'm worried about. All day I thought my nerves were for the Steeler game (I'm so sad they lost, seriously, my heart hurts) but now that that's over, I'm still kinda freaked out. I know I can do the stuff that I have to do tomorrow, but I'm just really wishing that it was like 2:00PM tomorrow afternoon so it could all be over. 

After my boards are done I've decided that a few things will happen. I will get my little sob story of the shit I had to go through out there via this page, whether anyone ever reads it I really don't care, at least it'll be out of my system. I'm also going to start to look for loans so I can follow my dream cause the longer I put this off the more depressed I tend to feel. I realized it the other day, there is nothing keeping me here except my dog, and well...on Saturday morning I thought he was gonna die and I've never cried that hard EVER. I guess in my twisted way it's OK if I leave him but if he leave's me I'll never get over it. That dog is my life. And that is sad. I'm 21 people! I need a bit more of a life. 

I'm nervous. I keep looking at my bag for tomorrow and I don't look in it cause I know everything's in there, but somehow I just want to look at it and have it tell me it'll all be OK. I'm nervous. I'm never gonna get to sleep. I think I'll go listen to Journey."

Well, now I realize I have to take my boards, like for real. I have to call sometime this week to schedule the Theory (book) part and then on January 24th I take my Practical part, where I actually have to do a haircut and perm and all that good stuff. Ya know what? January 24th is really freakin' soon and I want to get my Theory out of the way first. Which means either next week or the week after I have to take it. Problem: I haven't even looked at my book in over 2 months. This should be fun. I also have a job for the next three weeks. SO when will I study? Good question, when I find out I'll let you know. I hope this month goes smooth. I'll be happy when it's January 25th."

"event","I've had brain surgery twice. And recently I have noticed that I'm not over it. So I've decided that I need to write it all down. I started tonight. I think that once I'm done, I'll post it. It'll be very long, but I think it might help me move on to get the whole story out of my system, what I went through physically, mentally, emotionally to get it out of my head and onto paper where it can just be a story, no longer my past I refuse to notice. See, if I don't get over this I'm never gonna get to follow my dream and I'm really close to possibly taking a big step and a big risk at the moment so I know that if I don't get this out of my system now, then it'll completely swallow me whole and I'll be depressed for life because I didn't follow my heart and my dream never came true. I guess my New Year's resolution will be to get this shit out. Seriously, I need to get over it so I can finally get back my 4 years (I think it was that long) that I lost due to being ill. Great, now it's in writing and I can't get away from it. Happy New Year, I hope it will be prosperous. For you and for me."

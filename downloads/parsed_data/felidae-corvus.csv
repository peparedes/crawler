"event","I picked up a few books on Buddhism, today:
<i>
<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Mindfulness-Learning-Way-Awareness/dp/1577314417"">Beginning Mindfulness</a>
<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Buddhism-Explanation-Buddhist-Life/dp/0948006277"">Introduction to Buddhism</a>
<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Living-Buddha-Christ-Thich-Nhat/dp/1573225681"">Living Buddha, Living Christ</a>
<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sit-Down-Shut-Up-Commentaries/dp/1577315596"">Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye</a>
</i>
I'm particularly excited about reading the latter two, but I think mindfulness will help me with therapy, and the introduction book will help put everything in a basic context.  

I also pre-ordered Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (<i>squee!</i>).

I've been feeling disconnected, lately.  By that I mean from other people.  This ties into all sorts of things.  I define myself by my relationships with others, so as I try to determine who I am independent of anyone else, a disconcerting side effect appears to be the realization of detachment from others.  I'm convinced that this will pass, as everything I read about meditation appears to point to a feeling of connection with the world around you.  

I believe it also comes from the breaking down of my need for approval.  In not seeking it, I'm not getting it.  So I feel lost, confused, and generally cut off from my sense of self--considering that the self in question has always been ""Someone thought I did well--today I am good.  I've upset someone--it must mean I'm bad.""  Imagine removing all reflective surfaces from your home.  It would be disorienting to never know what you look like.  Again, though, I hope that eventually I won't need a mirror--as that's a false representation.  It's not the truth.  Hopefully I'll see the truth.  

In the same vein, I'm also trying to stop checking in with others.  I'm trying to respect that O processes things internally, and I've been trying to stop asking how he feels and let him come to me.  Imagine removing all windows from your house.

Claustrophobic, yeah?

So, I feel sealed off within myself.  

I really don't know if the latter is what I should be doing, or what he wants, or any of that.  Even so, questioning my habit to constantly ask what people are feeling and thinking has made me realize that I will never know.  This isn't to say I wasn't aware of this fact, but lately I've been feeling it to be true more and more.  People are caught up in their own experiences.  Somehow, it felt like I could make myself a part of another person.  Now I don't feel part of anyone.  So I feel adrift.

Which, oddly, is exactly where I feel I should be.  If I've nothing to anchor me to anything else in this great big sea of everything, maybe I'll just stay within myself.  I'll be forced to face whoever it is that I am.  <i>Then</i> maybe I'll be able to start building connections with the people around me in a more healthy way.

Or maybe that's all rubbish and O needs to get over himself and start communicating with me.
  
We'll see, really."

"event","Earlier, I went down to the garage--which will henceforth be referred to as the batcave--to work out, and to meditate.  I was successful at the latter, for a while.  It was really quite nice, and I think I came to a lot of helpful conclusions about various things that I may go into another time.  Mostly, it was simply nice to notice my breathing, or the cool air from the fan on my face.  

After a while, I stopped meditating, and simply began thinking.  

My thoughts wandered to food, as they tend to do.  I can't remember a time in my life in which I didn't feel fucked up about food.  I remember it being a source of unpleasantness and anxiety when I was in elementary school.  This was not helped when I got into junior high, and my body became the enemy in multiple ways.  The girls made fun of my chubbiness, and my already large breasts.  The boys tortured me regarding my body--teasing, or outright assaulting me.  Worry became loathing, and I dreaded mealtime.  

In high school, I discovered dance, and fell in love.  For the next four years, I absolutely lived and breathed both dance and colorguard.  I'd like to think I was good, considering my small size and curvy figure.  The drill team instructor taught the dance class, and hated the fledgling colorguard, as it took attention away from her dancers.  While I was growing increasingly thinner, I was not tall, blonde, or bubbly.  The drill team, being mainly a kick-line, went in for girls who looked similar.  Additionally, they just weren't terribly interesting, to me.  I was learning much more innovative dance styles in colorguard, so I remained there, even after my sophmore year (when I was eligible to try out for the drill team).  Oddly, while my dance instructor made it clear the couldn't use me because of my chest (never smaller than a triple D) she never really forgave me for joining the dance team.  She continued, however, to encourage me to lose weight.  

This is a woman who weighed 98 pounds while 8 months pregnant.  And while she was tiny, she was several inches taller than my 5'1.  

While never breaking 100 pounds, I lost weight dramatically.  But it never seemed enough.  I remember my frustration at the fact that my ribs were not visible through my leotard.  The gap between the floor and the small of my back when I laid down was not large enough.  I would stare longingly at other girls who, when their knees and ankles were together, several inches separated their thighs.  

Of course, we all disliked ourselves.  I remember a girl on the swim team who was also in my dance class.  She was tall, and lanky.  She had no breasts to speak of, but legs that went on forever.  She came up to me one day and confessed her jealousy of my small stature, and in particular my grace and flexibility.  I told her that I wished I was tall, and thin, and strong, as she was.  

These pressures, coupled with bizarre messages from my mother (who I learned when I was an adult also suffered from an eating disorder) meant I went back and forth between restricting for days, weeks, or months, and sneaking seconds from the kitchen when my mother wasn't looking.  In this way, I have not put a crumb of food in my mouth without overwhelming guilt in more than 15 years.  I can't even remember what it feels like to eat simply because I'm hungry, and enjoy the food simply for what it is--if I ever really knew in the first place.  

It has never been about vanity.  It has been about doing as I was told, but doing it my way.  It was about being small, and unassuming, and out of the way.  And it was about dancing.  This was the only place I was happy.  I was in control; I was pleased with myself, and I didn't really care what others thought of me.  I felt nothing but the moment.  No worry, no fear, no anger, no stress, no yelling, no hitting, no taking.  I felt everything and nothing all at once.  I was part of the music, and separate from the world.  And the thinner I was, the more I could do.  The better it looked, and the better it felt.  I wanted to attain the perfection I saw in the other girls--the girls who had been in ballet since they could walk.  

Oddly, meditation gives me a similar feeling, albeit without the notion of perfection, really.  But I feel the same connectedness.  I notice changes in my body, and in my environment in much the same way my body would react to a song I'd never heard in ways I didn't even need to think about.  I'm calm, and peaceful, and in the same in-between place I go when I dance.  

But I still consider every bite with suspicion and shame."

"event","I've just thought of something about observation and judgment, and while it's nothing new, I'm sure I'll lose it, so I'd like to write it down.  

I joined several communities for DBT, Borderling, and Buddhism.  It makes my friends page interesting, to say the least.  In reading the communities on BPD, an opinion of mine is reinforced.  While internet communities for mental disorders can be helpful at times, for some, I am of the opinion that they can also be harmful, particularly if they're run not by professionals, but by those dealing with the disorders.  

For some, it can be cathartic to express your true thoughts and feelings.  Certainly posting to an internet forum that you'd like to cut is better than actually cutting.  It's also amazingly helpful to discover that you are not alone in your experiences.  You're not abnormal; others have gone through the same thing.  For people with borderline characteristics it can be especially helpful, as it serves to validate your thoughts, feelings, experiences, or troubles.  You can find a group of supportive, empathic individuals who have been there, and know what to say to help pull you out of it.  

It can also be a place to become mired in your depression, fear, anger, delusion, or self-loathing.  It can be a sanctuary where you find an anonymous group of individuals who will enable your self destruction as a way to justify their own, or for the simple fact that the blind can rarely lead the blind.  If we really knew what to do to make it better, we wouldn't really be here.  This is not to say it's hopeless, just to say that when a cutter looks at me and says ""I'm so depressed. I want to cut, what should I do?"" my brain immediate clicks ""Cut.""  I would never say this, of course--my point is simply that my reflexive response is the unhealthy behavior.  I'm having to unlearn it.  

In making these observations about the community, it occurred to me that they might be judgments.  I then thought, if someone from the communities in question saw this post, it may hurt their feelings.  They may feel as though it's an important safety net, or tool in their recovery.  However, I defended to myself, my opinions are not to be taken personally.  Really, they're meaningless, as I have formed no feelings on what my observations <i>mean</i>.  I don't consider these communities ""bad"" or ""good.""  I have assigned no moral value to them.  

The concept of observing without judgment seems impossible.  How can someone observe anything without forming some kind of opinion about it, or analyzing it in some way?  Often, when discussing Buddhism, I see people ask questions regarding the nature of something, and many people respond by saying it ""is what it is.""  It's a difficult concept to internalize, especially with little context.  I realized, in thinking about these communities that I have observed people's experiences with them (including my own) but I make no judgment as to the value of those experiences.  The people in them are not good, bad, stupid, intelligent, etc.  The communities are what they are, and people will take from them whatever they will.  

Too often in our everyday lives we observe something--a woman, for example--and make judgments.  She is fat, or thin.  She is tall or short.  Her clothes are tight, or baggy.  Her hair is dyed.  She is wearing make up.  Her breasts are real, or fake.  She shaves or she doesn't.  She has long or short hair.  

These things are simply observations.  They become damaging, however, when we assign value, or judgment to them.  When we think ""She is <i>too</i> fat, and that's gross.""  It isn't ""Her hair is dyed"" it's ""Oh my god, look at her hair; it's so <i>trashy</i>,"" or ""She's so <i>weird</i>.""  

In group, we're often told to let go and observe our feelings without judgment, and we often feel we've failed as we think ""Ok, I'm observing.  Observing, observing, man this is hard.  My nose itches.  I shouldn't have said that to so-and-so.  Shit, I'm not focusing.  Ok, I'm observing.  Fuck, I'm distracted again.  GAH.  What is WRONG with me?""  

We will be distracted.  It's simply the nature of the human mind.  The problem is that instead of watching those distractions as if they're ""clouds passing by"" we assign value to them--usually negative.  

The truth is, they simply <i>are.</i>"

"event","Lately I've been thinking a lot about why I'm in therapy.  I don't mean why I have whatever psychological problems I have, but why I sought help.  

There are many reasons, and on my good days it's because I'm tired of just barely surviving.  I want a happy life.  I want to know who I am and what I want, and I want to be able to make those things happen.  I want to stop hurting the people around me.

And therein lies the question on my bad days: is this just one more thing I'm doing for other people?  Specifically, I've spent the past week wondering if I'm doing this exclusively for my husband and why.  

Now, of course I'm doing this partly for my husband.  And the rest of my family.  My roomates (who are basically my extended family) and my friends as well.  I'm tired of hurting them.  I'm tired of them hurting me.  However, I'm really internalizing more and more just how little of <i>me</i> I actually express.  I define myself by the people around me.  On bad days it makes me feel empty, and blank--is there anything here?  Do I have a personality at all?  Sometimes I feel angry--why do people expect so much from me?  It's impossible to please everyone.  Some days I'm depressed--it's merely another way in which I have no value.  My thoughts, while chaotic and varied, invariably include others.  What they may think of what I'm doing or thinking.  How it may affect them.  Whether it will please them or make them angry.  

So, naturally, my thoughts are consumed with the notion of whether or not DBT will make me more like whatever it is I perceive my husband (We'll call him O) wants me to be.  

O processes things more internally, as men (in a very generalized sense) tend to do.  He's actually much more internal than most of the men I've known, but I suspect this is because early arguments and difficulties in our relationship coupled with my self destructive or aggressive behavior has made him hesitant to express himself.  So, I'm trying to learn that not everyone processes thing verbally, like I do.  I'm trying to respect the idea that heavy emotional conversation in general causes him stress.  

To that end, I'm focusing my energy on ""letting things go"" and observing without reacting.  I think it's healthy to learn that I don't have to express every idea that pops into my head.  What I fear, though, is that if I let everything go--what will be left of me?  What <i>is</i> appropriate to express?  Should I crawl into myself and simply observe the world as it goes by?  

I cleaned out an area of the garage.  I got a small radio that has an audio-in (so I pipe my iPod through its speakers).  I pushed aside the boxes cluttering the front half of the garage.  I set up a fan.  It's really quite nice.  I did it because I miss dancing.  I dangle it in front of myself as a reward if I can ever starve myself down to the weight I was in high school.  You see, dancing anywhere in public--in a class, a gym, a park, or even in my own living room--is too humiliating.  I tell myself I'm disgusting, and no one should see it.  I can't shake the feelings of insecurity right away, but I have found a way to do what I used to enjoy in private.  It feels good.  I'm rusty, and out of shape, and my body feels alien after so many years letting my flexibility and strength atrophy.  I don't care, however.  I'm sweaty, and stinky, and sore, and happy.  It feels like me.  

But I wonder--will I just hide there?  I used to sit by myself for hours, or even days at a time, and simply do nothing.  This was not a form of Zen introspection or mindfulness.  It was simply a desire to be out of the way, to disappear.  

I know that I'm too much.  I'm too intense, too quick, too loud, too blunt, too aggressive, too emotional, too honest, too everything.  In trying to ease off, will I simply silence myself?  

My path has always been one of extremes: all or nothing, black or white, up or down.  I bounce erratically from one end of the spectrum to the other repeatedly in a single day.  Sometimes in a single hour.  

Where is the middle path?  How do I know if I'm on it, or simply replacing the need for attention with my very old survival tactic of simply hiding?"

"event","I'm not entirely sure where to start.  I'll think of writing about my experiences in group, but then feel as though I have to explain why and how I'm there.  But the history of how I wound up here seems a little intimidating.  It may be something to express, but not now.  

Suffice it to say, things happened.  They were overwhelming.  I sought help, and after a myriad of attempts at various forms of treatment, I found <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavioral_therapy"">DBT</a>.  I work with an individual therapist, as well as in a group setting.  It's been three weeks, and it seems by far the most effective treatment to date.  

Interestingly, I recently began reading about Buddhism out of academic curiosity, and found the philosophy to be an excellent fit in regard to my inability to deal with external stimulus in an effective or healthy way.  Basically, Buddhism is neat, and sounded helpful, although a bit lofty.  For example, meditation seemed to be exactly what I needed to help me calm my mind, but the very nature of my chaotic thought process that needs meditation also means it's incredibly difficult for me to accomplish. After the first session of group, I noticed that it essentially <i>was</i> Buddhism--in a limited and sort of general way.  I asked my therapist if this was incidental or intentional, and she explained that it was indeed intentional, as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_M._Linehan"">Marsha Linehan</a>--the developer of DBT--is, herself, Buddhist.  

My group meets weekly for an hour and a half, in which we go over our diary cards, and then discuss new skills.  This seems pretty standard for DBT, so I don't really feel the need to explain it.  If anyone ever actually reads this, and is curious as to what diary cards entail, ask and I'll happily answer.  

What's far more interesting, to me, are the people in my group.

<b>The Dancer:</b> A tiny woman who I assumed had been a dancer, simply because she looked it, I suppose.  I recently confirmed that she was.  We can smell our own, I guess.  I also recently confirmed she has disordered eating.  This was also something I assumed from initial observation.  Not simply because she's tiny (and she is) but also because her hair, skin, how cold she always appears to be--and simply the fact that she's here.  She is the only woman in the group who is very obviously underweight.  

She appears very nervous.  She shakes a bit, which seems to be both a physical symptom and a product of her nervousness.  

She's incredibly sweet and empathic.  Another woman in group was having a difficult day, and The Dancer was nearly in tears herself.  

She's often the first to speak.  She asks excellent questions, and is extremely honest and open.  She recently moved from New York, and doesn't appear to understand how brave she is.  She's a painter.  She needs to create.  She smokes the same tobacco as me.  

<b>The Engineer:</b> An incredibly quiet man in his late 30s or possibly early 40s.  He always has his sunglasses resting on the back of his head while indoors.  Recently expressed problems with anger, which I found surprising.  He's soft spoken and gentle, but appears to crave order.  Considers his disordered eating and insomnia to be a product of forgetfulness or business.  Also seems to have had a drinking problem in the past.  Very hard on himself.  

He also seems very hard on himself, but also very honest and open.  At least in this setting.  He appears to want social interaction, but becomes caught up in the details of the interaction, rather than enjoying the experiences as they happen.  He then beats himself up over his reactions.  He seems very frustrated with his inability to observe without judgment.  He also seems eager to do well in the group.  In general he seems eager to be successful.  

He often mentions his engineering mind--it refers to both the way his mind processes information, and the connections or analogies he draws regarding the world around him.  

<b>The Drama Queen:</b> An older man with diabetes.  He speaks often of how he doesn't trust his reactions or decisions, as they are all ""wrong.""  No details on how or why they're wrong.  He mentioned the idea of stubbing his toe, and then wanting a cigarette.  This seems to point to the idea that he's not aware of the emotional process going on internally.  On top of that, his quick or seemingly odd reactions were probably harshly judged.  

He's incredibly hard on himself, but masks this with a sort of forced apathy.  He tells himself he's along for the ride in order to break down what he perceived as being past mistakes.  He does seem willing to learn, but is neither enthusiastic, nor outwardly optimistic.  He expressed being extremely manipulative, to the point of having no personality of his own.  He's very sweet, and very sad.  I hope he doesn't give up.

He reminds me of my father.  

<b>The Veteran:</b>  Has been through the program before.  Appears to have barely restrained aggression.  Gets upset when things are not to his standards, and masks this with sarcasm intended to seem light-hearted or pleasant.  Falls asleep randomly, and has had several wrecks because of this. He's very cynical.  Not terribly honest or open, as even his honest statements are wrapped in fake emotion intended to illicit a desired effect.

Lost his wife.  He is extremely lonely and sad.  He basically want to learn how to have friends without ""imposing [his] will on them.""  He makes me extremely nervous.

<b>The Girl Next Door:</b>  Very friendly.  We share the couch.  Only slightly older than me.  She married young, and has been married for around a decade.  She still loves and likes her husband.  Appears to have issues most notably with anger and depression.  She appears to react emotionally without fully understanding the cause.  Extremely open and engaging.  Very enthusiastic about the treatment.  

<b>The Teacher:</b> The female version of The Engineer.  Retro hair and make up--very 60s.  She, however, appears to be in her mid-thirties.  Her father owns and runs a ranch or farm.  She's a teacher, an overachiever, and a perfectionist.  She mentioned in the first session her unhappiness with being there.  She has begun to relax, however.  Not terribly empathic, although not mean.  Again, very sweet.  Just a bit clueless.  Seems to have problems most notably with depression.  

There are several other individuals, but none of them have consistently been there enough for me to make many observations about them."

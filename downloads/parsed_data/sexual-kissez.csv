[This is <b>MY</b> journal, and its about me, if you dont like me, dont add me. And if i dont like you, I wont add you back.]

...Got a problem with me? Then, screw! Why you even lookin at this?! =]</strike>

<b>-Edit-</b>6/6
As of <i>now</i>, I <u>will not</u> add you if you leave a <b>stupid</b> comment. Such as..<strike>""Add Me""</strike> I mean thats <b>very</b> <i>original</i> & all but it </b>doesnt</b> do much for me. <u>Therefore</u>, unless you can be <i>more</i> <u>creative</u> & gimme a <b>good</b> goddamn reason, I <i>wont</i> be adding you.

But <i>feel free</i> to leave me an <b>anonymous</b>:
<i>insult</i>-
comment-
<u>sentiment</u>-
death-threat-
<b>love note</b>-
criticism-


<b>If you can't be famous be infamous...

When people have nothing better to do then talk about me, that says something. It says people need lives.</b>

PS-If you're already a friend, you dont need to comment. ;D"

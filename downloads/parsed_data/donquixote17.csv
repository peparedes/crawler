"event","I recently fell back into Lost and I&nbsp;wondered to myself why I&nbsp;ever stopped watching. For some reason, I decided to stop watching it after Season 1 on TV. This show is just amazing. I don't think I&nbsp;can even express how wonderful it is. This is what you call a season finale. Totally unpredictable! Poor little Ben just wanted to be accepted! And Juliet! I admit i hated her when she first appeared but she grew on me. She and Sawyer just belonged together. Screw Kate/Sawyer. Kate can shack up with Jack and both angst/brood/cry together. This is such a smart clever show. As much as I&nbsp;want it to never end, I'm glad there is a decisive conclusion instead of some slow agonizing death. It's a high concept show that delivers. It's a shame what happened to Heroes. That had lots of potential and squandered it all. The only thing good about it was that it introduced the world to Zachary Quinto."

"event","I was not impressed. You would expect more from this guy because of his critically acclaimed work, but maybe studio pressure changed his vision. I will say that Hugh Jackman was in fine physical shape, maybe even the best out of all the movies. That's pretty much all I can say. The villain is laughable. You know what's going to happen if not exactly how. The way they executed it was laughable. The relationship between the brothers should have been fleshed out more instead of a pretty introductionary war montage. They inserted as many cameos from other mutants as possible, but once again grossly underused them. This film should never have been made if it wasn't going to be done well. Hugh Jackman does seem awfully enthusiastic about it, but then again, what has he done recently that was good? Australia felt like a really long tourism commercial. I really felt nothing during that long long movie. The movie Deception with Ewan MacGregor was ludicrous. I think he should stick to singing/dancing and looking hot. Here's hoping that his new movie with Madeline Stowe will be good. He does look quite good rugged. 

For a supposed $150 million dollar movie, the special effects looked awfully cheap. Where did all the money go?&nbsp;"

"event","As a closet trekkie, this movie pretty much hit all the spots. J.J. Abrams can do no wrong in my eyes. This is what you call a reboot while honouring the source material while still making it fresh. Hire young people with actual talent who aren't just mimicking the originals. It helps that the marketing and trailers really draw you in. It's cool to like Star Trek again. The plot involves some time travel that allows this universe to continue while allowing everything that has occurred in the past to stay in canon. Perfect cast, I&nbsp;particularly liked Zachary Quinto as Spock. At first, I&nbsp;couldn't stop thinking that I was watching Sylar on screen, but I quickly got over that. I laughed, I squealed, and yes, I will admit that I&nbsp;teared up in the first 15 minutes. I get easily emotionally manipulated when it comes to things like this. This is why I&nbsp;also teared up in the opening credits of Superman Returns and Revenge of the Sith. Embarassing, but I know. I&nbsp;could tear up for this but not at all for Oscar bait like the Reader. 

It's also Robert Pattinson's 23rd birthday. May he live long and sparkle. I read that somewhere and I&nbsp;can't stop using it. He recently signed onto to do this period epic written/directed by Madeline Stowe. As long as its in the vein of Last of the Mohicans, I&nbsp;am all for it. Rachel Weisz + Hugh Jackman plus kidnapped Robert Pattinson? i am so there. He's a busy busy bee. I'm glad he's chosen his projects wisely and I&nbsp;don't think he'll be typecast in teen heart throb movies like a certain Zac Efron. Even though they're really close in age, I&nbsp;still think of Zac Efron as a boy and Robert Pattinson as a man. Maybe its because I secretly want to marry him..."

Read a draft version of the New Moon Script, thank goodness I kept the tab open because minutes later it was taken down. It's way better than Twilight and really preserves the essence of the book. Best part is how much they've littered Edward throughout it. The more Edward the better. Jacob/Bella dynamic is wonderfully fleshed out. There is lots of Edward/Bella kissing. The ending was changed so it's not quite so melodramatic and sadly there is no proposal.They're probably going to save it for Eclipse to have more of an impact.  All the important parts of the movie were there, they just jazzed it up a bit, like the confrontation between Edward/Bella with the Volturi. Its true when Rob Pattinson says he gets his ass kicked more. Also, the less we get to see of Rosalie, the better. Let Alice have her moment in the sun. Apparently the director of Eclipse said some negative remarks about Twilight. As long as he does a good job doing the movie I&nbsp;have no complaints."

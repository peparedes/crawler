Got a new bike recently. Trek, blue, mountainbike.. i loves it. XD anyway. I rode it today with the seat up to the right height and Man o man i got such a good workout in my legs. I was aching! So i felt like i definetly got something accomplished today besides boring old schoolwork. which happened to be geometry. but luckily there are only two days left until that class is over. i'm excited. Yeah. i might do some more leggie stuff. like squats on the side of the wall, leg lifts, and some cardio stretching. Tomorrow i think i'll work on chest and abs. but we'll see. i'm going to dive into fitness education pretty soon now that i'll have some more time. :D anyway. word up. and leave comments!

"event","Hey! my name is Daniel and this new blog will be for my workout updates. I'm still pretty new at working out so i thought i might put reviews of what i do each week. and maybe get feed back. I will add my professional before photos according to my Arnold S. Encyclopedia.. and I will add progress photos every 3 weeks to note developement. This place is free for people to comment and encourage or give advice. I would most definetly appreciate it! 

Sadley the past few weeks have been sacraficed to college work and it has been draining all my energy. However I've been stretching a lot lately especially in the mornings. Does anyone have any healthy stretching, waking up routines?

Daniel's Fitness Goals


*Look great! - Since I am just begining I want to achieve a sexy cardio look for starters. People posting cardio exersizes/advice would help me a lot. However, I do eventually want to be bodybuilder status so like they say I'm just going to build it up one at a time, start with looking sexy then moving on to mass.

*Gain Mass - I intend on working every muscle classic muscle in my body. *No Muscle Favoritism, even though I am looking forward to a more muscular chest abs and legs.
After I post pics I would appreciate people pointing out exactly which muscle i need to work on next and the name so I can expand my bodybuilding/anatomy vocab. I'm treating this journal as a learning tool, and I will expect it to change over time.

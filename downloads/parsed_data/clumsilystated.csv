Run a 10K (as the first step toward running a marathon in the next year or two)<br />2. Finish my novel<br />3. Write a play in June 2007 (<a href=""http://www.scriptfrenzy.org"">ScriptFrenzy</a>- from the people who run NaNoWriMo)<br />4. Successfully complete a Chinese class- I took the first step by registering for one today!<br />5. Take a management training class (as suggested by the CEO)<br /><br />I have been on a huge self-improvement kick lately.&nbsp; I hope it keeps up... the more things I change, the better I feel.&nbsp; For example, I have been running for the last 4 days.&nbsp; I am still pretty slow, but I'm keeping it up.&nbsp; I'm working on building up my distance before I work on speed, although I'm tossing in some interval training in a few weeks, and I am registering for the 10K as soon as it's available.&nbsp; I am also excited for the Chinese class to pick up (which might happen if I could be bothered to go to Alexandria to buy the textbook...).&nbsp; And I'm cleaning out my apartment and donating or selling all of the things I don't need anymore.&nbsp; It's refreshing to get rid of the stuff that just kind of weighs me down.&nbsp; I'm finding I don't need a whole lot of stuff to be happy.&nbsp; So if you're in the market for anything, chances are I have it available. ;-)<br /><br />I wish this weekend were longer... I know it was three days, but the thought of sitting through training tomorrow for eight hours seems exhausting.&nbsp; And to think I have to do it on Wednesday, too..."

"event","On Monday, the very first day of 2007, I went to Capitol Hill for the viewing of President Ford.&nbsp; It was a bit drizzly when I got there, but the rain cleared up quickly and the wait was just over an hour.&nbsp; It would have been a shorter wait, but I arrived at the same time that the current President and First Lady arrived and the public wasn't allowed in with them.

I went for two main reasons.&nbsp; The first reason is simple: I live in Washington, DC, and I like being part of history.&nbsp; I have been a history student in some way, shape or form for most of my life.&nbsp; I love knowing that in 60 years I will be able to tell my grandchildren I was part of something that they learned about in history class.&nbsp; I'm weird that way, I know.

The second reason I went was deeper.&nbsp; I actually knew very little about President Ford aside from he was never elected to either the Presidency or Vice Presidency (he got both jobs after the resignations of Nixon and Agnew, respectively) and he was criticized and likely lost his own bid for the top office because he pardoned Nixon after Watergate.&nbsp; I didn't feel the same ties as I did to Reagan, who was president when I was born and- gasp!- some of whose policies I actually agreed with.&nbsp; For Reagan's viewing I waited for six hours in the sun in a line of more than 60,000.&nbsp; But I decided to brave the crowds for Ford as well.&nbsp; Ford wasn't a very well-known or popular president.&nbsp; A lot of people seemed either uneducated about his life or disinterested.&nbsp; But here's the thing about people in elected office: they give up a large portion of their lives, they sacrifice their family life, and they exist solely in the public eye to serve their constituents.&nbsp; That's a really hard, honorable thing to do.&nbsp; It's not easy to make decisions knowing that the American public's interest and welfare is at stake.&nbsp; And yet these people offer to do it anyway.&nbsp; I would agree that many of them want the power and prestige that accompanies an elected office, but there are some that rise to the occasion and want to make a difference.

I don't agree with everything that presidents do- the current one has certainly made a lot of decisions that I entirely disagree with and wish had never been made.&nbsp; But I appreciate the fact he and all of the past presidents have been willing to serve.&nbsp; Think of how often smart, capable people don't contribute back to society- think of the number of people you know who couldn't even be bothered to vote during the last election.&nbsp; Think of the number of people who whine about how bad things are but couldn't be bothered to step up and endorse a candidate or run for themselves.&nbsp; Think of all of the good ideas entirely wasted because someone isn't motivated enough to write to their Congressman or write a letter to the editor or even share that idea with a friend over coffee.&nbsp; I don't like politics very much (which is a reason why I majored in Poli Sci- but that's another story).&nbsp; But I fully respect those who were so fed up with the system they decided to step up and do something about it.

I didn't know much about Ford, and I disagreed with some of the things I do know of that he did.&nbsp; But I value his contribution as an American who sacrified his time and life with his friends and family to serve the public.&nbsp; He was a leader in this country.&nbsp; The least I could do in rememberance and thanks was to stand in line for an hour or so to pay my respects in person.&nbsp; I met several interesting people in line, and we shared stories about who we were and why we were there as we walked through line.&nbsp; I got to offer my condolences to his daughter Susan who was standing at the end of the receiving line.&nbsp; And on the way home I realized that I need to do more in my life to contribute to society.&nbsp; I have a great life; but I could have a greater life if I did more for others.

I am lucky enough to have the ability to accomplish a lot in my life, but sometimes I look at my accomplishments and feel a burning desire to make a greater impact than I have.&nbsp; Maybe that's part of being human- but I don't want to be complacent.&nbsp; I want this year to be about being something more than what I have been.&nbsp; I wonder how I could ever measure the progress on that goal...

Rest in peace, President Ford.&nbsp; And thanks for the sudden inspiration."

"event","<p>One of my resolutions is to update this thing more often, so only 12 hours into the new year I am making it happen.&nbsp; That and I'm still too tired to move from my bed. :)<br /><br /><br />Was 2006 a good year for you?<br />2006 was a great year.&nbsp; Aside from a handful of rocky moments and tough times, I did a complete 180 from where I was a year ago at this time.&nbsp; I barely know how to begin to improve on how things are right now, but I'm looking forward to trying. :)</p><p>What was your favorite moment of the year?<br />The phone call I got saying I had a job offer back in March!&nbsp; Immediately after that, I got a second offer which I was able to reject (since the company was horrible), I booked a trip back to Boston and spent the weekend with my mom, and I had dinner with friends in DC.&nbsp; I felt like I was finally justified in moving back to the District.</p><p>What was your least favorite moment of the year?<br />Probably breaking up with Eric... just because it was the right thing to do didn't make it hurt any less for the first few weeks.</p><p>What did you do in 2006 that you had never done before?<br />I got&nbsp;a real job, I went on my first business trip, and I bought a car- and drove it 8 hours to Boston by myself.&nbsp; It was a big roadtrip for someone who had never had that kind of freedom before.</p><p>Where were you when 2006 began?<br />At Heather's apartment</p><p>Who were you with?<br />Heather, John and Kaiti</p><p>Where will you be when 2006 ends?<br />I spent the evening at the Grand Hyatt in DC being very drunk and very happy and wearing a fabulous green dress.<br /><br />Who will you be with when 2006 ends?<br />Jamie, Megan, Christina, Danielle, Catherine, and assorted friends and boyfriends.</p><p>Did you keep your new years resolution of 2005?<br />I didn't make any last year.&nbsp; In 2005 I jokingly said my resolutions were to find a job and not get myself killed, and when&nbsp;I didn't come close to achieving the first one and barely kept the second one I decided resolutions were a bad idea.&nbsp; I have changed my mind a bit now.</p><p>Do you have a new years resolution for 2007?<br />1. Run a 10K in the spring (I'm shooting for the Capitol Hill Classic in May), and if I like running enough I want to tackle a half marathon in the fall<br />2. Join a kickball team (hey, I heard the DC league is fun!)<br />3. Create and maintain a more detailed budget<br />4. Make better food choices: less junk food, more veggies.&nbsp; Along those lines, I think I am going to be a vegetarian once a week- I could stand to cut back on red meat.<br />5. Write more often.<br />&nbsp; 5a: Update this journal more often and blog about real topics<br />&nbsp; 5b: Finish my NaNoWriMo book; participate in the playwriting version of&nbsp;NaNoWriMo in June</p><p>Did you fall in love in 2006?<br />No, I guess not.</p><p>If yes, with who?<br />--</p><p>If yes, do they know?<br />--</p><p>Are you still in love with them?<br />I actually fell out of love this year...</p><p>Do you regret it?<br />--</p><p>Did you break-up with anyone in 2006?<br />Yes.&nbsp; I think we're trying to be friends now, but admittedly I'm not very good at this particular phase.</p><p>Did you make any new friends in 2006?<br />Yes!&nbsp; In fact, I met some of my best friends this year.</p><p>Who are your favorite new friends?<br />I really don't play favorites when it comes to friends, but I will say the girls I spent New Years with are some of the most fantastic people I have ever met.</p><p>What was your favorite month of 2006?<br />February was pretty good all around.</p><p>Did you travel outside of the USA in 2006?<br />Nope.&nbsp; I had hoped to go to the Caribbean, but Eric was always too busy.&nbsp; 2007 has to be a travel year... I feel the need to see the world again.</p><p>How many different states did you travel to in 2006?<br />Ummm... Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, Nevada.&nbsp; I traveled through a bunch of others as well.</p><p>Did you lose anybody close to you in 2006?<br />My grandfather passed away in August.&nbsp; Aside from that, we were lucky not to lose anyone this year.</p><p>Did you miss anybody in the past year?<br />I miss people all the time.&nbsp; It's part of my nature... I miss everyone when they aren't with me.</p><p>What was your favorite movie that you saw in 2006?<br /><em>The Holiday</em> was a great movie.&nbsp; And I won't lie... Clerks 2 was pretty great.</p><p>What was your favorite song from 2006?<br />""Chasing Cars"" by Snow Patrol.&nbsp; Totally love that song.</p><p>What was your favorite record(s) from 2006?:<br />I really didn't buy many CDs this year, and the ones I did buy weren't particularly new... but The Fray's CD was great.</p><p>How many concerts did you see in 2006?<br />Not many... Journey and Def Leppard in July, John Mayer and Sheryl Crow in September, The Reflex a bunch of times, and a handful of smaller club shows.&nbsp; </p><p>Did you have a favorite concert in 2006?<br />Journey and Sheryl Crow were both great... and I ran into people I hadn't seen in a long time at both of them!</p><p>Did you drink a lot of alcohol in 2006?<br />Danielle actually had the best answer to this: in the final moments of 2006, as we were getting ready to go to the Hyatt, she said to everyone, ""I could drink all of you under the table... everyone except Steph anyway.""</p><p>Did you do a lot of drugs in 2006?<br />I have never done any drugs.&nbsp; Absolutely not my scene.</p><p>How many people did you love in 2006?<br />I love many people... in terms of romance, I loved one person, but in terms of warm fuzzy love, I love too many people to count.</p><p>Did you do anything you are ashamed of this year? <br />Ehhh... a few.&nbsp; But I can't change the past, and I don't dwell in it.</p><p>What was the worst lie someone told you in 2006?<br />I'm not sure I should post that on the internet.</p><p>Did you treat somebody badly in 2006?<br />Yes... I wasn't nice to Eric in the end.&nbsp; I should have treated him better, and I apologized, but I still feel sorry about it.</p><p>What was the best thing you bought in 2006?<br />Plymouth the bunny and my car!</p><p>Did somebody treat you badly in 2006?<br />A few... Eric especially, but break ups tend to bring out the worst in people.&nbsp; That's pretty much why people break up though.</p><p>How much money did you spend in 2006?<br />I don't even want to think about what that number might be.</p><p>What was your proudest moment of 2006?<br />Definitely at the end of the year when I was in my goal review session at work and the CEO said I am constantly reminding him why he hired me in the first place.&nbsp; That was a great compliment.&nbsp; And my parents both told me they are proud of me at Christmas, and knowing I have their approval makes me happy.</p><p>If you could go back in time to any moment of 2006?<br />I wouldn't.&nbsp; The memories are so good I wouldn't want to relive them or recreate them- just remember them.</p><p>What are your plans for 2007?<br />Move to a townhouse, travel, keep up the resolutions, and enjoy every moment of this fabulous life I get to lead.</p><p>Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:<br />Same one I always pick- from ""Pretty Good Year"" by Tori Amos<br /><em>They say you were something in those formative years<br />Hold on to nothing as fast as you can<br />Still... pretty good year</em></p>"

"event","I'm coming down with a cold.&nbsp; I can feel it in the back of my head, behind my nose and in my eyes.&nbsp; I hate this feeling.&nbsp; I have spent the morning sipping tea and eating those Cold-Eeze zinc tablets like it's in my job description.&nbsp; And my whole body is achy.&nbsp; My arms are achy, my toes are achy, and my head is especially achy.&nbsp; This would be a great day to go home early, put in a movie, and sleep until tomorrow.&nbsp; Instead, I'm going to wait it out and hope I feel better after lunch.&nbsp; I'm sincerely doubting it, but it's worth a shot.&nbsp; Besides, my sick days roll over to next year, and I want to know I have a few waiting for me if need be. 

The better news is that one week from today I am driving home for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Granted, the road trip itself could be the longest 10 hours I will ever spend trapped in a car (save the 10 hours it will take to get back here on Sunday), but I'm going to make the best out of a potentially bad situation.&nbsp; I would almost rather drive it by myself (with PK- he will be an adorable little co-pilot), but on the other hand it might be more enjoyable than I am preparing myself for.&nbsp; I just feel very uneasy.&nbsp; I don't like feeling anything other than happy, which is were I usually balance out.&nbsp; Thanksgiving Day also has some potential to be, oh, less than ideal... I'm not exactly thrilled with how it has all played out.&nbsp; But I had nothing to do with the decisions that were made, so my job is only to deal with the results and try to keep smiling.&nbsp; This will be an interesting challenge.&nbsp; I'm bringing just about every CD I can carry just in case. 

Ugh.&nbsp; Too much negative energy. 

I'm very much looking forward to New Years Eve.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to another fresh start.&nbsp; Saying goodbye to 2005 was a huge relief and a really exciting moment (even though nothing actually changed- just because a new year starts doesn't automatically wipe our slates clean).&nbsp; Saying goodbye to 2006 will be bittersweet, though.&nbsp; 2006 was absolutely the defining year I wanted.&nbsp; A new job, a new chance in DC, a fantastic group of new friends, and the strengthening of some older friendships.&nbsp; I also said my share of goodbyes, some more permanent than others, and some still yet to be defined.&nbsp; And although there is still a lot of time left in 2006, I'm starting to prepare for what is to come.&nbsp; I'm already reflecting on what was and getting excited about what is to come.&nbsp; I used to plan my years according to how I wanted them to go and change my priorities as things panned out.&nbsp; I won't make that mistake again.&nbsp; That is a New Years resolution I made early this time around. 

My novel writing has actually been going really well this month.&nbsp; For the first year it's almost week 3 and I still think this piece of crap has some literary potential.&nbsp; And I love all of the characters.&nbsp; All of them mean something to me this time.&nbsp; I'm still pretty serious that I'm going on Oprah's Book Club sooner rather than later. :) 

If I could put half as much energy into researching the cost of case binding as I did into this blog I would be a much happier camper.&nbsp; Although not as happy as I would be if my cold medicine would kick in and make me feel better than groggy..."

"event","Today I actually got a political flyer in my mailbox instead of the usual collection of bills and credit card applications.&nbsp; It was kind of surprising, actually, because in all of the time I have lived in this hotbead of political lunatics I have never had anything directly sent to me.&nbsp; But it got me kind of excited, too- I get to vote as a Virginia resident for the first time next week.&nbsp; And elections here are pretty intense- Allen vs. Webb, the gay marriage ammendment... I like voting.&nbsp; I like being heard.&nbsp; Probably not a surprise for anyone who knows me, but I like contributing to something bigger than myself.&nbsp; I like voting because the government and this country is bigger than me, and lending my voice to it reminds me that my contribution is important and necessary.&nbsp; I know I am probably the last person left on this planet who believes voting can make you heard, but I do.&nbsp; I believe it.&nbsp; And it makes me happy to think that.

Bottom line: vote!

In additional exciting news, I spent most of my morning chatting with the CEO's executive assistant.&nbsp; She has an extensive background in theatre, and I can listen to her talk all the time.&nbsp; She likes to tell people that we're so similar because of our theatre connection and because we think the same way, which I love.&nbsp; She told me today that she is working for the Kennedy Center and for one of the DC opera houses; then she told me that every once and a while they need production assistants and if I am interested she will recommend me for one.

If I could be a production assistant for the Kennedy Center my entire life would probably be complete.&nbsp; There would be no need to try anything else; I would have accomplished just about everything I ever dreamed about.

On the other hand, I will continue to plug away at the daily grind... partially because I'm still very excited about the China trips, and partially because in a few weeks the company is giving me my very own office.&nbsp; And it will have filing cabinets and a big L-shaped desk and bookshelves, and there will be a door that I can close when I decide to eat lunch or want a few moments to myself.

I think the door is more important to me than even I know.&nbsp; The COO told me about the office yesterday, and I said, ""Really?&nbsp; With a door that opens and closes?""&nbsp; He probably thinks I'm insane.&nbsp; I think he's a great guy, and for some reason I can't manage coherent sentences when he is around.&nbsp; Thank goodness he is forgiving when it comes to me being a total moron.

I have also been considering going to church.&nbsp; This was a weird conclusion to come to because I have never gone to church on any kind of regular basis.&nbsp; But in the last month I have been in two of them, and I have emerged both times with a strange sense of peace.&nbsp; Anyone who knows me well (that means you, Josh) knows how absolutely out of left field this comment is.&nbsp; And it might not pan out; but it might, and I think I owe it to myself to explore this as a possibility.&nbsp; I have come to a spiritual crossroads of sorts.&nbsp; Perhaps it's time to start taking other avenues to understand what is going on in my life.

It's National Novel Writing Month, and I'm working on another book.&nbsp; This year is different though: it's day one and I don't hate the novel at all.&nbsp; I think it's going to turn out really well.&nbsp; And I still think my topic is pretty good.&nbsp; I'm optimistic that this time next year Oprah will be introducing it as her next book club selection.

This is about as disjointed an entry as I can write.&nbsp; My mind is all over the place.&nbsp; But it's a nice feeling since all of the thoughts are good, and I am in a good place.

What can I say?&nbsp; When you're on, you're on."

"event","I think if someone were to ask my boss if I had any quirks, she would probably mention that whenever she asks me how my weekend was I always pause and think about it for a few seconds before answering.&nbsp; She usually asks what kind of weekend would require a pause; most people would just say that it was good/bad/busy and be done with it.&nbsp; Instead, I reflect on everything and make a judgement right then and there.&nbsp; Perhaps I could spend more time thinking about it as I decompress before bed on Sunday, but usually I am too busy talking on the phone or working on something to give much thought to anything on Sunday nights.

I had a good weekend, which I was able to say pretty definitively this time around.&nbsp; Saturday I went to Shenandoah Valley with the girls for some hiking and to enjoy the scenery.&nbsp; I got some nice pictures which I plan to develop and use for my collage one of these days, and although I think there is probably better hiking elsewhere I'm glad we went so I can add it to the list of places I have been in my life.&nbsp; It was definitely worth the trip there, and in the sun it wasn't too chilly so it was also a good weekend to go.&nbsp; Saturday night was fabulous- Catherine and Megan and I drove to Dave and Buster's in White Flint (via Crystal City, via Tyson's, via White Flint, via Chevy Chase, via White Flint again) where we met up with Christina, her friend from Elon, Christina's boyfriend, and several of his friends.&nbsp; I had a great time enjoying&nbsp;a drink and nachos at the bar while watching a few college football games, and then I endulged myself with chocolate fondue and a cookie/ice cream thing during dinner (all shared- while rereading that I realized I should make that clear).&nbsp; Then we went home (via the beltway- White Flint to Greenbelt to Largo to Branch Ave to Alexandria to Arlington... we are not good with directions).&nbsp; It was a really enjoyable evening.

Sunday I went to a book club meeting and wound up having a really great discussion about the state of the world with some of the girls at my table.&nbsp; We started off talking about the education system in public schools, and that led to where kids go wrong, why some parenting strategies simply don't work, and how doomed we might be for the future.&nbsp; Most of the girls there seemed very undecided about whether or not they planned to have children, and the underlying reason for it seemed to be that they simply don't want to bring children into a society like the one we have today.&nbsp; I am in total agreement on that point- although I think children are in my future, I don't quite know how I would want to raise them.&nbsp; When you try to raise your children to be thoughtful, intelligent, active members of their communities, how can you help them to get past the kids who don't have it together- or even worse, how do you co-exist with parents who aren't bothered by their children dressing like the Pussycat Dolls and blowing off opportunities in favor of drugs/alcohol/living off their parents?&nbsp; We had some solutions to some of the problems, but not all of them... it's shocking how things have changed in just the fews years since I was in high school.&nbsp; But it was amazing to have such a real, focused, intelligent conversation with some people that I know very well and some that I had never met before.&nbsp; This is another reason I love DC- you can find those conversations in the most random places.

Sunday afternoon was spent baking cookies with Catherine- half of them went with her for her boyfriend, and the other half will be on their way to Eric this week.&nbsp; It was a very laidback afternoon, the cookies were delicious, and the quality time was great as usual.&nbsp; Christmas cookies will be in the works in December... and this time I'll take requests. :)

Next week at this time I will be boarding a train to NYC for a few days of meetings and dinner parties with the staff... hard to believe my second trade show is here already!&nbsp; Sometimes I can't quite grasp that I have been working here for 6 months.&nbsp; The time is really flying by... I wish I were better at keeping up with this journal because I think I will want to remember it all some day.&nbsp; I have spent a lot of time looking through the boxes of pictures and old projects and letters that my mom saved because she thought some day I would want them, and I am so grateful to have my childhood so well-preserved.&nbsp; I took on the self-appointed role as family historian because I am really proud of my family and who we are, and sometimes I wonder if my children will share this interest too.&nbsp; Maybe having such an intimate interest in my family will end with me... but just in case it doesn't, I still keep everything anyway.&nbsp; Maybe in 100 years or so someone will want to know about that crazy relative who spent her early 20s in DC, didn't drive until she was 23, and had a rather large number of rubber ducks in her possession.

Or maybe not. :)"

"event","<p>On Tuesday night, the DC area got just a little more dangerous when I went to a Toyota dealership and bought my very first car. <br /><br />Yes, you all read that right: I drive a car now.<br /><br />I bought a shiny blue 2007 Toyota Corolla LE that is just the right size for me and is less intimidating than most other cars I could have purchased.&nbsp; I managed to get the car for $900 under invoice (my negotiating skills are great- I should have considered law school more seriously!), and I drove it home right off the lot.&nbsp; So far I am thoroughly enjoying the 6 CD changer and not having to wait for the shuttle to get to work in the morning.&nbsp; Driving in DC is mostly terrifying, though, and I'm not crazy about reaclaimating myself to driving in a trial-by-fire way.&nbsp; Actually, I can't really say that driving is terrifying; I haven't screwed up yet.&nbsp; No missed turns, and only one person has almost run into me so far (she tried to merge into my lane while I was at a red light... if she could have waited a few more seconds I would have been out of her way).<br /><br />I think I will get used to this whole driving thing in time, but for right now I'm just trying to stay calm and collected.&nbsp; In fact, I only write this so that in a month or two I can read it and laugh about how stupid it was to be nervous about driving in the first place.&nbsp; And aside from being nervous about other drivers (which I need to stop since I can't control them anyway) I am enjoying it... driving on the Parkway to work is kind of relaxing!&nbsp; A good way to start and end my work day actually... I'm also pleased with my ability to navigate my way around the airport.&nbsp; I have a few trips to make in the next few weeks, including a few treks out to Tyson's Corner for training, so by the time Eric and I drive the new car home next month for Thanksgiving I should be a seasoned professional. ;-)<br /><br />Oh, the car's name is&nbsp;Blue Monstah.&nbsp; Vanity plates forthcoming. :-)</p><p>This weekend should be tons of fun...

- Kaiti and Wes are coming to visit for the weekend!
- It's chilly outside, and that means sweater season is approaching.
- Without setting foot inside a dealership I have a quote for $500 less than I expected to pay for my car, and I think the last place I call will beat it.
- The CEO of my company is buying pizza for lunch for all of us- for the second time in 3 weeks.
- I'm going to NYC in 2 weeks (and if you will be in the city then let me know!), and I'm going business class on the train.
- I helped my mom with a project that was bothering her, and I am really happy that she feels better now.
- My mom also liked the flowers I sent her for her birthday.
- I have come up with several thoughtful, individualized presents to give to friends and family for Christmas/Hanukkah this year, and I am excited to see their reactions.
- I get 2 weeks off for the holidays!  It's like college 2.0!
- Eric and I are turing Thanksgiving into a DC-Boston-DC roadtrip, which means about 16 hours of quality time with him, the iTrip, and my 6-CD changer.
- At this very moment in time I got a new, very comfy, ergonomically correct desk chair. :)
- I'm having an early bird dinner with the girls tonight, and that is always a good start to the weekend. :)

"event","Fall is coming to the District.&nbsp; That thrills me for two reasons.&nbsp; The first reason is because I love the fall.&nbsp; I love it when the air is a little bit crisper, the leaves turn brilliant shades of red and gold, and I can come to work in cozy sweaters instead of t-shirts.&nbsp; I love how there is apple and pumpkin picking in my future.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to picking a Saturday morning, heading out of the city, and taking pictures of the leaves with the autumn sun shining through.&nbsp; I love that Starbucks has pumpkin spice lattes out again.&nbsp; I love that the Patriots are playing every weekend and I found a great bar in Old Town to watch them and have a beer.&nbsp; I'm just a huge fan of the fall.&nbsp; The second reason is that this is the first time that summer has ended and I have stayed in DC.&nbsp; In 2004 I had to leave when summer was over to go back to Pittsburgh, and the only thing that gave me the drive to pack my things and go was the promise I could come back the next year.&nbsp; In 2005 I had to leave in July (for obvious reasons), and although my intention was to come right back I wasn't ready to actually make my move until the end of February.&nbsp; But this year the weather is changing, fall is here, and so am I.&nbsp; It probably sounds trivial, but it's one of my favorite achievements for this year.&nbsp; 6 months in this city, and more are ahead of me.&nbsp; Finally!<br /><br />I had a great trip back to Boston (still my favorite place to spend the fall) this past weekend for Heather's bachelorette party.&nbsp; I spent all of Friday evening sitting at the airport because my flight was delayed (several times actually), so I had a lot of time to work on some knitting and think.&nbsp; [Sidenote: I don't spend a whole lot of time just thinking anymore- I had this conversation with Danielle last night, and I was telling her that I don't spend much of my time alone anymore.&nbsp; In college I was much more likely to want hours, even days, to myself to catch up on school work.&nbsp; I was over-extended in every direction, so if I could turn into a hermit at any time I would do it.&nbsp; Now I don't like to spend more than a little bit of time alone.&nbsp; If I'm home by myself I am on the phone or on AIM, and even then I'm usually planning to meet everyone somewhere.&nbsp; I'm no good by myself.&nbsp; I'm too Type A.]&nbsp; I'm really excited for her wedding.&nbsp; I think it's really cool that our friendship has lasted so long that we have shared all kinds of monumental experiences in our lives.&nbsp; We were in band together in grade school, we went to London and Greece together in high school, and even though our lives have taken us through many different circumstances and brought us miles apart physically our friendship has grown and changed and adapted.&nbsp; I'm really lucky to have a friendship like that.&nbsp; I'm even luckier that I have friendships like that with a few other people as well.&nbsp; Even Eric and I have that in a way- granted, one day we kind of hope to live in the same place, but for right now I'm happy with what we have.&nbsp; But I felt even more honored to be part of Heather's wedding and to know that someday she will be part of mine, and in a few years we will be part of our children's lives as well.&nbsp; I definitely had a very cozy feeling this weekend.&nbsp; Even as I sat in a deserted airport waiting for&nbsp;a plane that was 3 hours late and finally arrived long after Starbucks and the bar closed.<br /><br />I had a fabulous weekend at home.&nbsp; It was actually a bit upsetting to come back here after having so much fun with people I don't get to see very often.&nbsp; But as soon as we landed and I got off the metro and walked home I felt a lot better.&nbsp; I am at home in a lot of places&nbsp;now.&nbsp; I think even Pittsburgh would feel like home if I ever went back to visit.&nbsp; And I still have two more trips to Boston before fall is over.&nbsp; That definitely makes me feel warm and happy.<br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Boring car stuff"">I am putting off buying the car (slightly).&nbsp; The new target date is October 2.&nbsp; The reason for this is I am putting the money I would spend on the car and parking this month on a GPS system, which will be lots of fun to use in DC (especially when I go to Tyson's Corner for training!).&nbsp; I also realized I will have very little use for the car between now and October 2nd, aside from driving to and from work, since I am only here for another week before my next trip to Boston.&nbsp; I might as well not get it until I really need it, and I might as well save up for GPS.&nbsp; I'm getting pretty anxious to have a car now, and I'm even looking forward to driving home for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Maybe I'll finally feel like an adult when I can drive myself to the grocery store and to work... or, more likely, I'll feel like a little kid with a new toy. :)</div>
<br />Now I just need it to be 4:30 so I can head home, pick up a few groceries, and start getting excited for the season premire of Boston Legal!!!<br /><br />And by the way: the fact that LiveJournal has changed things around for Talk Like a Pirate day is awesome.&nbsp; Arrrrgh. :)"

"event","It's pouring rain, it's going to get worse as the day goes on, and the sounds is making me fall asleep at my desk. And even that doesn't matter much since there are exactly 6 people in the office today. I considered taking today off, but since I'm not going anywhere for the weekend it wouldn't have made much sense to be sleeping and lounging when I could get some work done. <br /><br />Wow, did I just <em>say</em> that? When did I become a slave to my 9-5?<br /><br />There's a lot to say, so I'll break it into sections:<br /><br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""This week / I'm buying a car!"">This week has been really uneventful, due in part to a cold I feel coming on. Which is ironic because my health insurance kicks in today, and I was positive I would never have another health problem once I was insured. I almost want to go to the doctor just because I can now- but I don't really need someone sticking a wooden stick down my throat and saying it's a head cold, go home and sleep and come back when you actually have something wrong with you. So I spent the week creating several elaborate budgets (yay for a real paycheck!) and online car shopping (I have decided on a 2007 Toyota Corolla LE with a moon roof and cruise control and CD player in Indigo Ink Pearl. I saw one parked on the street in Pentagon City last weekend when Danielle and I went to dinner, and I have pretty much decided that's the car for me. That could change with the test drive, of course, but I drove Eric's Corolla (yes, we will have his and hers Corollas- except mine is newer and not gray), and I like it. Do I need a car right now? As in <em>really</em> need one? Probably not. But it's about time I got one. Like I said to Christi last night, I made it through all of high school and college (even though that meant walking in the rain from Forbes and Wightman to Hobart Street in the rain just about every day senior year), and now I can finally afford something that doesn't suck. And I can drive PK home for Thanksgiving- and knowing he doesn't have to spend another holiday in foster care makes me very happy. <br /></div>
<br /><br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""My grandfather died :("">The week has also been long because Grandpa (my dad's dad) died last week, which stirred up a variety of emotions I was otherwise unprepared to deal with.&nbsp; I'm sad that he's gone, I'm sorry I didn't keep in touch, I'm devastated that he spent his last year mostly alone.&nbsp; I'm angry with how he treated my dad, I'm angry most of his things will be sold in an estate sale, and I'm really angry that all of the pictures and things he had there will probably be thrown away.&nbsp; There is nothing that I hold more dear to me than my family's history, and my dad's side is pretty much gone now- Grandpa's only heirs were Dad, my aunt, and Kaiti and I.&nbsp; That whole side of the family is practically gone.&nbsp; And any chance of salvaging some of it- through pictures and letters- will be gone soon too.&nbsp; I don't know what the will says, but I'm not so convinced a lot of that stuff will make it into anyone's hands.&nbsp; I could care less about everything else- I just wish there were something I could hold on to.&nbsp; I have the pearl necklace my grandfather had made for my grandmother with the pearls he picked from oysters when he was stationed in Japan.&nbsp; I have the pins he got in high school and college, and I have the bars he was awarded in the Army.&nbsp; That might be all that's left of one side of my family.&nbsp; Maybe that breaks my heart more than anything.<br /></div>
<br /><br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""The month ahead / I don't want to grow up!"">In better news, September is looking like it will be a better month than August.&nbsp; August wasn't horrible; definitely&nbsp;not like last August.&nbsp; Tonight I'm going to BD's Mongolian BBQ with the girls (assuming we don't get swept away by the rain!), and I love BD's so I'm looking forward to it.&nbsp; Sunday night Christina, Megan, Todd and I are going to see Sheryl Crow and John Mayer, who I liked more when he wasn't linked to Jessica Simpson.&nbsp; Monday, if the hurricane has blown through, I plan to spend entirely by the pool unless something more interesting comes up (and something probably will).&nbsp; I'm going home the weekend of the 16th for our 4th annual Mulch Day, where we do yardwork all day.&nbsp; My parents would otherwise have to do it alone, and I don't like them working that hard when I can be there to help.&nbsp; And that night is Heather's bachelorette party and assorted pre-wedding festivities, so that will be a fun trip home.&nbsp; And two weeks later is the wedding itself- I can't believe the first of the thong-a-thoners is getting married!&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp; It makes me feel kind of old.&nbsp; I always said I didn't want to get married until I was at least 25... but now that 25 is looming in the not-so-distant future can I push it back?&nbsp; I don't want to grow up!&nbsp; Being young in DC is too much fun! :)<br /><br />(On the other hand, even if/when Eric moves here he'll still be at races on weekends... just as long as I don't feel obligated to spend my Saturday nights channel surfing and making dinner I can probably deal with getting a little older.)</div>
<br /><br />And that's what's new in my corner of DC.&nbsp; Now if only I could write this much on things I'm paid to write about... :)"

"event","I called my dad last night, mostly just to catch up, and we talked for an hour and a half.&nbsp; A lot of it was me asking for advice- when to buy a car, how much to contribute to my 401(k) this year, when to start thinking about investing elsewhere.&nbsp; I joked that I would appreciate it if he could buy me a car, and he told me he would for my 40th birthday.&nbsp; The he said he plans to live to be about 90 or 100.&nbsp; That was the single most comforting thing I have heard in a long time.&nbsp; I know nothing is certain, but to think my dad could be around until I am into my 60s and 70s was such a relief.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I would do if something good happened to me and I couldn't call home.&nbsp; I like thinking I still have the rest of my life to do that.

The car thing is actually going to happen.&nbsp; I'll let you all know when you should start avoiding roads in the DC metro area (and the Boston area in late November).

I have so much going on these days.&nbsp; I hate how quickly my 20s are flying by."

"event","<p>In January 2005, when I decided not to use xanga anymore, I created this journal and named it clumsilystated because I couldn't find the words to describe what I was thinking.&nbsp; At that point in time I was in DC, working at CYLC, and dreading the spring semester because it meant leaving the District all over again.&nbsp; I was also dreading returning to the college lifestyle; I liked college, love it even, but I wanted to grow up.&nbsp; I was never a frat party girl, and I didn't like the useless selling out and weird networking attempts- I made some very true friends, but wow did I see some people screw up perfectly good friendships because they were so concerned with what their ""friends"" could do for them rather than what they could do for their friends.&nbsp; I didn't know how to vocalize my desire to move beyond all of that, and I didn't know what a fitting name the journal would have and how it would reflect on the journey that has taken me through this last year.&nbsp; I was logging in a few nights ago and I realized I don't have trouble saying what's on my mind anymore.&nbsp; I can usually find the right words these days.<br /><br />It being a particularly difficult week for me, one I might document in a friends only entry at a later time, it's nice to know my words are coming back to me.&nbsp; Finally.&nbsp; Oh how I have missed them!<br /><br />So yes, this is a complicated week.&nbsp; It is made easier by dinner tomorrow with my dad at <a href=""http://www.fogodechao.com"">Fogo de Chao</a>, a staff retreat in Leesburg from Thursday morning until Friday afternoon, Friday evening girl time and some quality MacGyver episodes, and on Saturday morning at the crack of dawn I'll be off to Florida for four days of beaches and sunshine and celebrating my birthday.&nbsp; I keep reminding myself over and over how busy I am going to be so that I know how fast this week will pass.&nbsp; I'll feel much better when I'm on a plane out of here... I'm so glad I'm in DC, but I haven't left in a few months and I need to clear my mind.&nbsp; Everything moves so quickly.&nbsp; It's a wonder I keep things together sometimes.<br /><br />I'm going to watch Family Guy and go to sleep.&nbsp; Yes, it's 10 PM and I try not to go to sleep this early because I feel old when I do.&nbsp; But I'm stressed and sleepy and I need to relax.&nbsp; And tomorrow will be a crazy day at work... yes, that will be my excuse. :)</p>"

"event","This morning, as I wandered back toward my desk after a nice conversation with one of my co-workers, I opened outlook and found five emails about the staff retreat next week.&nbsp; One of them, the agenda, was kind of fun to read because I like knowing what I'm doing.&nbsp; The other four all involved something that I need to do- namely read the business plan (60 pages), 2 articles (probably another 100 pages combined), and complete an exercise with a bunch of scenarios in it to see what the company should do.&nbsp; It was the closest I have felt to being back in college since... finals second semester senior year.&nbsp; I loved college, but I think I love it more that it's over and I see where it fit into my life.&nbsp; Trust me, it's way more fun to go out on Fridays when you don't have a term paper due on Monday.&nbsp; This weekend, of course, doesn't quite count since I do have homework due on Monday.

Since it's officially the end of July, my birthday celebrations can officially begin as well.&nbsp; Friday is dinner in Bethesda with a whole group of girls, Saturday will be the birthday weekend celebration #1- drinks, dinner, and dancing with a few of the girls.&nbsp; Sunday will be homework day.&nbsp; Tuesday my dad will be in town, and we're going to Fogo de Chao, an amazing all-you-can-eat Brazillian BBQ place.&nbsp; Wicked expensive, wicked tasty.&nbsp; Plus my dad is buying, and he said drinks are included.&nbsp; Wednesday will be a very long, sort of painful day- most people who read this know why.&nbsp; More about that later.&nbsp; Thursday and Friday are the staff retreat, and that means I'm spending Thursday night at a resort in Leesburg.&nbsp; And Saturday morning before the metro starts running I am off to Florida for the real birthday weekend.&nbsp; Saturday will be partying on the beach with Jamie (and Eric and whoever else wants to come with), and I think on Monday we're going to the Melting Pot for my 23rd birthday.&nbsp; Good lord I hope my 23rd year starts off more smoothly than my 22nd did... and with all of the things going on in my life between now and then, I hope I have some time to enjoy it.

"event","I haven't updated this in, oh, forever, and that's mostly because I have been too consumed with having fun and causing a disturbance through the DC/Norther Virginia area to spend much time online.  That being said, I break my hiatus to comment on the president, the media, and the warzone that is currently ingesting the Middle East.

So war breaks out, rockets are being aimed throughout the region, and Lebanon and Israel are at odds in every sense of the word.  The media reports back to all of us who are watching hell on Earth from our cozy little homes and ocean and a few thousand miles of land away.  And aside from a few conversations about it, people don't seem to have much to say.  I blame that on most people being uninformed about the history of the region, but that's to be expected- unless you were in IR, you probably don't give a shit about other countries.

And that word is exactly what brought this topic further into the limelight.

President Bush happened to use a bad word when speaking into an open microphone while discussing this latest turn-of-events with Tony Blair.  He said, ""See, the irony is that what they need to do is get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit, and it's over.""  Although the president kind of simplified the problem, to some extent I agree with him.  But then comes the media circus who can't get over that the president used a bad word.  Was it because he said it into a microphone?  Not really his fault; he didn't know it was on, so it was an honest mistake.  Was it because he said the word shit?  I hope not.  I mean, let's review.  He didn't call anyone a shithead.  He didn't tell them to eat shit.  He didn't say something he didn't intend to back up, like, ""Shit's gonna hit the fan when the US gets involved.""  He referred to terrorism and blowing people up as shit.  And that's true; I think everyone would agree that region is not the safest, most stable place you could be at the moment.  But seriously, all of this over one word?  Maybe I shouldn't run for president.  My only real second language is a cross between trucker and sailor.

That being said, I'm sure the anti-Bush sentiment is having a field day with this one.  The only really great way for this presidency to end will be in 2008, when Bush leaves the White House for the final time, and Americans in unison say, ""That's our president!"" followed by laughter and applause.  It's a sitcom.  Politics is a farse.  I can understand why no one takes it seriously or chooses to vote anymore.  Americans don't have that kind of passion these days.  Maybe before we go out and force our democracy on others we should clean up our own model.  You know, the one that doesn't work so well these days.

And I'm out.  Stay tuned: I think I'll be back a little more frequently from now on.  Nothing like living in the nation's capital to get you fired up over everything. ;)"

"event","After browsing craigslist for six months trying to find the perfect apartment, I'm also well-versed in what exists and what doesn't.&nbsp; I was naive to think I would be able to afford this city on my own- between the cost of rent, the rising cost of utilities, and the fact Comcast can't seem to provide basic cable and internet for subscribers without charging them a day's salary, it simply can't happen during your first year out of college.&nbsp; That's why I feverently scanned the apartments/housing and housing wanted sections of the site for as long as I did... a good combination was out there, and I was determined to find it.&nbsp; (I did, but I digress). 

If you want to find a spacious 1-bedroom apartment near a metro with a washer and dryer, parking, and most utilities included, it's going to cost you at least $1600 a month.&nbsp; If you don't need to be near the metro, or DC for the matter, you can work your way down from there.&nbsp; If you don't mind living in SE or a scary part of NE, you might be able to do it for less as well.&nbsp; But I have to roll my eyes every time I see someone else moving in from the midwest or somewhere else where housing rates are still affordable trying to have it all for $800 a month.&nbsp; It can't happen.&nbsp; It's impossible. 

I wrote a really long rant about finding solid, safe housing a few months ago.&nbsp; I'm tempted to revisit it again.&nbsp; But really I'm just ticked that I'm spending a ton of money today to pay off moving, storage, and rent.&nbsp; If it were spread over a few weeks that would be one thing, but 3 huge bills at once makes me feel queasy.&nbsp; I know I'm being reimbursed for most of it, and I also know that my tax return is covering a large chunk of it (as well as all of the money I have made since starting here), but spending more than $100 at any time makes me nervous.&nbsp; I guess it's good to be nervous about money.&nbsp; But really, I hate the whole thing.&nbsp; I should have been born in the 50s or something.&nbsp; But I'm sure they thought things were too expensive back then, too.

Oy.&nbsp; This whole thing won't matter in a few hours when I have my things back for the first time in 8 months.

I'm updating this from work, which I swore I wouldn't do, but it's been quiet today and I don't have a ton of stuff to do.&nbsp; My next big project is temporarily on hold until we get some of the stuff I'm missing from California, and that will probably take a while.&nbsp; I have been sorting through a lot of files and learning about the history of my department... at first I thought, great, overpaid intern work, but I'm glad I did it.&nbsp; It's interesting stuff, and if gave me a new perspective on what we're about and why I'm here.&nbsp; This morning I met with my manager to talk about the other program I am in charge of, and I had some ideas that she liked.&nbsp; I'm happy she's happy, but I'm really excited that I am to the point where I can think of ways to improve the program and the process.&nbsp; It validated my role here.&nbsp; I feel like I am actually going to contribute something here.&nbsp; Now I feel ready for whatever the next big thing is.&nbsp; Well, I'll be ready when I'm back from Vegas.&nbsp; That is eating up my energy right now.&nbsp; Oh, and so is moving.

In other great news, PK is coming to DC in two weeks!&nbsp; My parents are bringing the rest of my stuff to me, and he is part of the deal- I told them I would reclaim him once I was a fit mother again.&nbsp; I have liked living in&nbsp;a place with a cat because it's nice to come home to something warm and cuddly, but I miss my own baby.&nbsp; When he's here and I'm settled and my roommate is moved in, the new apartment will feel like home.&nbsp; Actually, it already kind of does.

The next time I write something will probably be this weekend, after the Comcast guy shows up, and it will be from my new home.&nbsp; The universe has realigned itself, and I will have a home of my own again.&nbsp; I don't count the last apartment as home since it was never really settled.&nbsp; In some ways, this will be my first real apartment- college counted, but I was only paying the utilities while my dad picked up the rent tab so it wasn't exactly my own.&nbsp; This time I'm paying the whole thing.&nbsp; I'm practically a grown up.

No, I take that back.&nbsp; I never want to really grow up."

"event","First off, to whomever out there gave me LJ premium, I can't quite explain how your timing completely changed my really miserable outlook on life around.&nbsp; I came home from work in a pretty bad mood and found that someone had thought of me even though it wasn't my birthday or a holiday... in fact, it was nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; In honor of you, whoever you are, I will try to fill this journal with something worth reading.&nbsp; Thank you.

It doesn't feel like spring outside just yet, but it definitely feels like spring in terms of everything else. Having a completely fresh start has been the best motivator... like I'm finally on my way toward something good. 

So to pick up where I left off (last weekend!), we didn't get the dream apartment.&nbsp; We found out last week that the landlord had accepted another group of people who wanted to move in one day before we did even though we had expressed interest first.&nbsp; In fact, if we had been contacted we would have gladly taken it a day sooner, but nevertheless it wasn't meant to be.&nbsp; The whole thing rapidly fell apart after that... the awesome roommate decided she was going to take a free room from some relatives (not that I blame her for that), and I was back to square one.&nbsp; I was in a bad mood for the rest of the week since I am stubborn and dying to see my things again, and I was really close to getting everything back only to suddenly lose it.

Then we get to Friday.

On Friday, my office took a half day and went on a bowling retreat to Lucky Strike by Gallery Place.&nbsp; It was really fun- aside from the fact we got paid to go bowling, all of the food and drinks we had were on the company tab.&nbsp; The first highlight was doing Irish carbombs with the staff... of course, that was after 3 or 4 drinks per person, so it's forgiven.&nbsp; The second was when the company president said he wants me to go to ISC West in Las Vegas in 2 weeks!!&nbsp; I wasn't sure if he meant it (this was after the carbombs), but at work today they made it official and it looks like I'm on my way... I won't complain about a free trip to Vegas!

I met Kasey after ""work"" for drinks at the Irish Times and dinner in Dupont... it was so exciting to see her since I hadn't since graduation.&nbsp; We're definitely going to hang out more often now!&nbsp; It's so good to be in the same city with her!&nbsp; Together we spent an insane amount of money for one evening... cover charges, Guinness, long island iced teas, pizza... that was my weekend spending right there.

Saturday I didn't do much until the afternoon, when I went to meet a new potential roommate.&nbsp; And Sunday we signed a lease on a great, spacious apartment in Crystal City!&nbsp; It's got a balcony, tons of closet space, a nice big kitchen, and we each have our own bathrooms.&nbsp; Best of all, there's a fitness center and a pool, and if we need to get to the metro we just go through the basement of the building into the shops- we don't have to walk outside!&nbsp; I'm totally thrilled about that.&nbsp; It makes me feel safer.&nbsp; Plus, there was no security deposit and no pet deposit, so it's affordable.&nbsp; And we move Friday!&nbsp; I'm getting my stuff back for the first time in 9 months!&nbsp; I'm not sure how to verbalize how great that is... it will be like Christmas all over again, except I'll have a good idea about what I'm getting.

I'm really happy about how everything is working out so well.&nbsp; A lot of people have told me that they are happy that the worst is over and my bad luck has run out.&nbsp; I've wondered a lot about that.&nbsp; Did I just have a string of really bad luck for about a year?&nbsp; Did things happen for a reason, or is it just my way of justifying everything?&nbsp; I have a lot of theoretical ideas about the universe and our purpose (which I'll get into later... I did promise more thoughtful entries), but I wonder whether or not things were simply off kilter for a while and now I have made peace with something and things are right between me and whatever is out there that governs our well-being.&nbsp; Of course, if it was all about luck, it's incredible how it all worked out.&nbsp; Especially since it all worked out well.&nbsp; But I'll get into that later... probably when I'm not distracted by the Gilmore Girls. :-)

I hope this is another good week.&nbsp; If this were my status quo for the next 9 months, I would be OK with that."

"event","I went to bed at 9:30 last night.  I tried to convince myself it was because I'm coming down with something, but I don't think that was it at all.  I think I'm just not used to this schedule.  The last time I had a full time job (many many moons ago...) it took me about two weeks to get used to everything.  And there is a ton to get used to.  Aside from the fact I am now offically in charge of three educational programs and a bunch of other details, I'm still trying to orient myself with everyone and all of the office specifics.  It's challenging to keep it all straight, but the people are awesome.  I met with one guy today who said he is a huge Boston Celtics fan, and then he told me a lot of people in the office go to Nationals and Orioles games during the summer as a group.  That made me really happy on a few levels- firstly, there is nothing better than a baseball game and a few beers on a summer night; and secondly, people in the office hang out after work!!  I was nervous that people would do their own thing all the time, but it's going to be nice to have relationships with people that aren't strictly professional.  So that gave me something to look forward to.

This schedule is rough though.  I'm working the early shift at work (8-4) because I like having part of the afternoon and the whole evening to do what I want.  But when I get home I only have enough energy left to cook dinner, eat, and curl up in front of the TV with my laptop and some knitting.  I think in a week or two I will get used to waking up early, but for right now it sucks.  I haven't even had the energy to call or email anyone- I got the best voicemail ever from Mariena a week ago, and I can't manage to stay awake long enough at night to call her back.  My throat is a little tickly... maybe I am coming down with something.  Yes.  That sounds significantly less lame than ""I'm tired because I have to wake up before 10 AM.""

This weekend will include some apartment hunting, probably both with and without a roommate.  I'm meeting up with one girl Saturday morning to check out some two-bedrooms, but there are still some one-bedrooms on my list just in case they aren't sketchy.  The good thing about living with a roommate is I can get a nicer place with my own bathroom and a washer and dryer, spend less on utilities, and have someone to hang out with after work.  But we'll see how it works out.  For right now, everything is possible.

I can't write anything else that is coherent today.  This whole entry was pointless.  I think this is just to document that I'm tired and apparently sleep deprived but still very happy.

7:00 is too early for bed, right? :-)"

"event","I think in time I will love this job.  Well, I love it now.  It's one of those love-at-first-sight things, the kind where you're just shocked and thrilled and flattered that it's yours and you were the one that got picked above everyone else.  You want to work really hard to show them they made the right decision.  Sure, in time there will be problems and long nights and questions about whether or not you could to better, but at the end of all of that will be a genuine, true love and respect for what you have accomplished.  It sounds a lot like a good romance.  I don't think work can ever be as important as true love (work can't love you back after all), but it's still nice to find something that makes you happy and like your time is being well-spent.

My first day was exceptional.  I love the people, my boss, and the fact my cube in centralized to a lot of offices so I get a lot of company.  The work is interesting, there is a lot to learn, and there will likely be some travel in my future.  We get the week between Christmas and New Years off as a company gift (and it doesn't count against vacation time!), and the CEO brought in girl scout cookies today.  Because some VIPs are coming into town this week, the company is paying for lunch for us every day (although today my boss and I had lunch at Bertucci's).  On Friday there is a happy hour to welcome the two people who started last week and me to the company.  I can't really speak highly enough of this place, although I wish I could.

Now begins the push to a.) find a new apartment, and b.) start to think about buying a car.  I walk to work now because it's only a mile there and back, and 2 miles a day means burning lots of calories.  I might consider living in one of the apartments around here... I don't know yet.  I like the area, although it's 10 minutes outside of DC proper and that feels kind of far for right now.  I don't know what to do about a roommate because I want to live alone, but that's really only because I don't want to deal with someone else's stuff.  I want to use my furniture, my kitchen stuff, my table and chairs.  I am also aware that's petty and selfish, but I miss my stuff.  I haven't seen it since the end of July.  I want it back.  But if I found someone who could be clean and respectful and social who only had a bedroom set... that might be OK.  I also think I could avoid a lot of the bad situations I had through college... I know what I can and can't tolerate now.  I hate having to screen people.  I hate trying to find things that are wrong with people before I even know them well.  But unfortunately, that's how people pick roommates.  X-factors are important.

I like feeling optimistic.  And I'm excited to get to work tomorrow.  That's a great feeling. :-)"

"event","I found <strong><u><font color=""#33cccc""><em>an amazing job</em></font></u></strong>. <br /><br />And more amazing than the job itself is the fact they offered the position to me. <br /><br />The worst is over, the bright light at the end of the tunnel is right in front of me, and I've taken my first step into what promises to me a great and exciting future. <br /><br />And now I'll start from the beginning. <br /><br />For those of you who don't know, or haven't put it all together yet, I'm back in DC. I woke up one morning in January and realized I wanted more than anything in the world my second chance at success. My first chance was interrupted by forces I couldn't predict or control, and I wanted to bury it in the past where it belongs. I found a place online where I could rent a room on a month-to-month basis while I tested the waters, and I packed my suitcase and moved in on President's Day. The house is beautiful and in a safe neighborhood close to the metro. I have my own room, free use of the kitchen and living room, and there is a cute cat to play with when I'm here. Last Monday I applied to two jobs. On Tuesday I got an email and scheduled an interview for Thursday. I also got a phone call from my roommate with a temp position offer while I was looking for work. On Wednesday, I went to her office. As I was leaving on Wednesday I got a phone call from the staffing agency that was handling the second job and set up an interview for Monday morning. On Thursday I interviewed with a company in Arlington for an Associate Producer position on a government affairs team. The interview went really well, although it sounded like a ton of responsibility and a lot of potential for failure. I was not as thrilled with it as I wanted to be. When I got home there was a ""takehome interview"" section waiting in my inbox. It took four hours to do- it was all research and conference planning on a topic I knew nothing about. I was a little put off by that, and I was a little wary of the position again. On Friday I went to work again, and then it was the weekend. <br /><br />Side note: I had an amazing night on Friday. I went to see <em>The Vagina Monologues</em> at American University with a whole group of girls from the DC area. We had an awesome time, and it was great to meet some new people! And they are wicked active in DC, so I'm looking forward to spending lots of time at happy hours and events from now on!&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y241/Calliope0101/VaginaMonologues1.jpg"" /><br /><font color=""#ff0000""><strong>A bunch of us after the show!</strong></font><br /><br />On Monday I went to the staffing agency at 10:30. I had to do 2 hours of computer and typing tests, and then I sat and waited for the results for 15 minutes. When I got called into my analysis interview the woman told me I scored in a advanced level for everything (big surprise- I went to CMU!), and she said she wanted to discuss a new opportunity with me. She pulled in the client manager for the company, and that woman told me about a job working in homeland and international security in Old Town Alexandria. It sounded interesting and I said I would interview for it. I left the agency at 1:30, at 2:30 I had a call from the woman again, and by 3:30 I was in Old Town for an interview. That lasted for a little more than an hour, and I had two separate interviews with two people from the company- the COO and the manager of the department. After about 10 minutes the COO started telling me all about the company's finances and what great shape they were in (when companies start divulging that information it's usually a good sign that they want to to feel comfortable there). The manager was harder to read, but she smiled a lot and seemed impressed by my resume and everything I had done over the last 5 years. I left there at 5:00, and at 9:00 the next morning I had an offer from them which I gladly accepted. <br /><br />About the job: I am the Education Coordinator for the company, and my role is to facilitate conferences and workshops while also managing talent, PR, and customer relations. It's not entry level at all, and the issues are really interesting- my dad actually works with some of them! The pay is much more than I thought it would be, and the benefits are amazing (severe bragging ahead): 100% company paid health, dental, and vision care (nothing comes out of my paycheck!), free parking, 401K, 5 sick days, 12 paid holidays, and 30 vacation days!!! That's six whole weeks!!! The staff is fairly young and energetic, the building is beautiful, and they said it won't be too long before I have an office instead of a cubicle. The downside is it's a temp position for about a month or two since it was through the agency, but I was assured it will be full-time very quickly because they told the staffing agency their intentions are to groom me for the manager position so they can promote the woman who has it right now. I'm still in a complete state of shock, but it's a happy feeling. <br /><br />Right after I accepted the job, I got a call from the people at CYLC- where I was supposed to work starting last summer- and they offered me a job. I told them the current situation, and they said if in the next month or so I don't like it at the new company they will gladly welcome me back! And then this morning I got a call from the company in Arlington who also made me an offer, but I got to go with my gut instinct and (politely) reject it. <br /><br />And that's where things stand. Employed, in a safe place, and I'm going back to Boston this weekend to celebrate! <br /><br />So thanks to everyone who has been so supportive and for keeping me positive, and a big thank you to everyone who celebrated with me on the phone and on AIM last night- and the celebrating will continue for a while! The next step is apartment hunting! If there is a secure building with an updated kitchen in a nice neighborhood, I am going to find it! <br /><br />For now, it's time to get some packing done and get ready to head out in a few hours- tonight I'm having drinks in Dupont and dinner in Georgetown with some of the girls. Perfect way to celebrate the middle of an awesome week. :-)"

"event","Every day I take the train into DC. Sometimes it's for work, sometimes it's for interviews, and sometimes it's for play. I pass the airport on my into the city, and I pass it on my way home. Every day I watch planes landing. Today I saw one taking off. I thought, W<em>ho would ever want to leave this place</em>? That's when I knew I was home again. <br /><br />Every day I spend my hours figuring out where I see myself in five years. I do that a lot; every potential interviewer wants to know the answer, and I like to think about the possibilities. A great job, a cute apartment in a safe neighborhood, a house in Florida, a graduate degree, life with my wonderful boyfriend, a puppy of our own. I haven't thought of the future as a place with possibilities and hope in a long time. That's how I know I'm better now. <br /><br />Every day I talk to people. I call my mom to say hi and have her calm my nerves, I call my dad for reassurance and to hear him say he's proud of me and he knew I wouldn't fail, I call Eric to be silly and because hearing his voice makes him closer. I IM Kaiti because she gets my sense of humor, and she's there for me around the clock. I email Nancy and find more support and friendship from her than I ever would have expected from a former employer. I call people and email people at random now, just because I'm thinking of them. That's how I know I wouldn't be who I am today without my support group. <br /><br />Every day I see the pictures I brought from home. A picture of my house, pictures of friends and family, pictures from high school and college. I look at them when I feel lonely and it connects me again. I look at them when I'm happy and I'm grateful for what once was, for it shaped my life. I look at them when I'm falling asleep and I know that somewhere in my mind I'm safe and sound. That's how I know I'll never forget where I come from."

"event","<a href=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y241/Calliope0101/Puppy6.jpg""></a>Two news items worth commenting on: <br /><br /><strong>DICK CHENEY</strong> <br /><br />The Vice President of the United States of America shot a man. <br /><br />But seriously. <br /><br />The Vice President of the United States of America <em>shot a man</em>. <br /><br />I still can't get over how few people seem at all surprised by this. Well, what I mean is I'm surprised at how few people are surprised that Cheney shot a guy. And yes, it was accidental, and this wouldn't have been quite as huge if his staff had been a bit more forthcoming with the facts in the hours after the whole thing went down. I'm kind of upset that he won't have to face any kind of responsibility or ownership aside from a $7 fee for hunting. If it had been Regular Joe who shot his hunting buddy, causing a number of complications including a heart attack, Regular Joe would have had a symphony of music to face in court and a slew of charges. It's a crime to shoot people, even if you think they look suspiciously like a bird. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that he shot a guy who was 30 yards away from him without recognizing that the object was a human- if you're going to shoot something, especially when you are hunting, I would assume you face the target, aim, and then fire. In that time, you have a good idea of where and what you are shooting. So yes, it was an accident; obviously there was no criminal intent involved. But as for the handling of the whole thing... wow. Just wow. <br /><br />The best quote so far was on the 11:00 news last night; there was a story about how the White House issued a statement condemning Britney Spears' decision to drive with her child in her lap. Then Jack Williams says, ""Well at least she didn't shoot someone!"" <br /><br />And just a random observation: quail and Iraqi seem like surprisingly similar words, eh? <br /><br /><strong>MICHELLE KWAN</strong> <br /><br />This whole thing kind of bothers me too. There's no doubt Michelle Kwan is a talented skater, and it's too bad that she isn't able to compete in Turino. But what about the girl who is taking her place? The one who was on the team until Michelle Kwan petitioned for her spot, and she was kicked off. She missed out on the opening ceremonies, on walking in with the USA team, and on the momentum surrounding the preparation for competition. Instead of that glory, she gets flown in alone and thrown into the middle of the chaos that undoubtedly surrounds atheletes competing in the Olympics. I feel badly that her first, and possibly only, Olympic competition couldn't include all of those special elements. I hope she is phenomenal this year. <br /><br />And a couple of random pictures: <br /><br /><img height=""264"" width=""212"" alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y241/Calliope0101/Puppy6.jpg"" /><br /><br />The Puppy is DONE!!&nbsp; I named him Big Puppy after Big Papi.<br /><br /><a href=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y241/Calliope0101/Puppy4.jpg""><img height=""221"" width=""297"" alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y241/Calliope0101/Puppy4.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />Big Puppy from the side.<br /><br /><img style=""WIDTH: 209px; HEIGHT: 340px"" height=""342"" width=""174"" alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y241/Calliope0101/Roses2.jpg"" /><br /><br />Eric sent me roses for Valentine's Day. :-)<br /><br /><img style=""WIDTH: 233px; HEIGHT: 331px"" height=""331"" width=""212"" alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y241/Calliope0101/RosesandPuppy.jpg"" /><br /><br />My Valentine's Day present with Eric's Valentine's Day present.&nbsp; Awwwww. :-)"

"event","<P>First off, a random gripe: I hate the term ""baby bump.""&nbsp; And if I hear or read one more thing about Angelina Jolie's ""baby bump,"" I cannot be held responsible for my actions.&nbsp; Seriously, can someone please come up with something that doesn't sound so stupid?</P>
<P>But anyway.&nbsp; Updates.&nbsp; Yeah.</P>
<P>I've been busy (wow! surprise!), and I've been productive, and I have an actual game plan for part of my life.&nbsp; It all started about a week ago, when I went to Daytona for Eric's and my anniversary.&nbsp; Yes, it has been eight years, and yes, that's a very long time.&nbsp; Longer than many marriages, as I've been told by several people who also mentioned that their marriages didn't last that long.&nbsp; We had a really great time and got to relax, which was good for my nerves and good for Eric since his season is starting approximately now.&nbsp; We saw Arlo Guthrie in concert in Jacksonville... I'm just totally inspired by him.&nbsp; Aside from the fact he has led a genuinely interesting life he also has done a lot to promote his father's cultural influence on music and America, and he's a truly entertaining performer.&nbsp; We also stopped in St. Augustine the next day for lunch, and I found a part of Florida I sincerely like.&nbsp; St. Augustine has this crazy little street (St. George Street I think) where you can shop, eat really good soup, and find amazing gelato.&nbsp; I think if I lived there I would probably spend a lot of time and money on their economy.&nbsp; More than anything the architecture is very cool... so much different than the northeast.&nbsp; Although I have to follow that up by saying there's no place like New England.&nbsp; I'll take Boston anyday, no matter how far from home I go.</P>
<P>That trip, plus a certain argument/discussion with a certain boyfriend, got me thinking about the future.&nbsp; I've avoided thinking about the future for a while because I simply didn't have any idea what I wanted, much less how to start.&nbsp; And if you don't know where you're going any road will take you there, and I've enjoyed this particular road for its duration.&nbsp; But one of the ideas I have really toyed with is grad school, and the more I think about it the more I want a graduate degree.&nbsp; So I decided that for the next year I will get my work experience and enjoy myself, and in fall 2007 I will start grad school.&nbsp; I've researched a bunch of places, and believe it or not (much to my surprise) UCF has what I'm looking for: I can get an MBA and an MPP in three years.&nbsp; Two degrees, cheap tuition (state schools are fantastic), and Eric said he'll move in between Orlando and Daytona so we can get a house and a puppy.&nbsp; The more I think about the plan, the better I feel about everything.&nbsp; The long distance will be over, I can live with someone amazing who will respect me and my (many) belongings, I'll be really close to tons of family, I'll be right near Disney and the beach (major attractions = lots of visitors), cost of living is cheap, I can have a puppy and an in-ground pool on a mortgage that is less than my rent in DC, I'll be able to get a car, I can go to Spring Training AND Red Sox/Tampa Bay games, and there is a Dunkin Donuts in the town we want to live in.&nbsp; Downsides are obviously that I won't be in DC, but that can easily be turned into an upside because a.) it's not forever, and b.) I can add the southeast to my list of places I have lived.</P>
<P>The main question will be what I want to do with my degrees.&nbsp; I have a few ideas, mainly entrepreneurial, but that can be finalized when I actually have them.&nbsp; I'm kind of excited to write a thesis and research something I'm really interested in, but I'm wicked excited to be closer to my family and get to spend time with them.&nbsp; I'm lucky to have the family I do, and I really just want to have something more than what I have right now.&nbsp; To have that, I have to compromise.&nbsp; My values have changed a lot.&nbsp; I think I woke up one day and saw myself on the track to being another nameless drone in a big company working for The Man, and that's just not me.&nbsp; I want the career, the satisfaction of doing something worth doing, but I want a personal dimension too.&nbsp; I want a family and a sense of security.</P>
<P>I'm more of a girl than I thought!</P>
<P>So yes, lots of personal revelations.&nbsp; Lots of soul searching and talking and breathing and finding what missing pieces would make me whole.&nbsp; But also lots of knitting!&nbsp; I made the coolest scarf and hat and mittens over the last few weeks, and I even made up the pattern for the hat and mittens since the book didn't have one.&nbsp; This is probably the best hobby ever.&nbsp; I'm so glad I took that class last year.&nbsp; I really miss my knitting sessions with Mariena and Beth, though.&nbsp; It's fun to knit, but it's more fun to knit with friends.</P>
<P>I'll end with some pictures of knitting stuff.&nbsp; And maybe next time I won't take so long to update.</P>

"event","<P>I feel like after the last few weeks, I could write a lengthy commentary about how to find an apartment in DC.&nbsp; I don't think I'll publish one until I have moved in somewhere and have successfully lasted more than two months, but for the time being I'm making a list of things I have learned.&nbsp; Those of you who have plans to live in DC at some point, take notice.&nbsp; Those of you who live or have lived in DC, feel free to contribute!</P>
<OL>
<LI>No one, and I mean <STRONG><EM><U>NO ONE</U></EM></STRONG> should have to pay $1800 for a one bedroom apartment in a reasonably safe part of NW.&nbsp; That's insane.&nbsp; I don't care what the ""market price"" says.&nbsp; If the ""market price"" dictated that you also drink a quart of turpentine before listing your property, would you do that too?</LI>
<LI>Worse than paying $1800 in NW, no one should have to pay $1800 for Bethesda, Arlington, or Alexandria.&nbsp; That's suburbia.&nbsp; Suburbia should have to pay less because they pay more to commute.</LI>
<LI>If the listing says ""Historic Northwest"" anywhere in it, keep looking.&nbsp; ""Historic Northwest"" means Eckington, Shaw, Ledroit Park, and a variety of other shady places somewhere on the green line or the wrong side of the red line.&nbsp; It's only affordable because no one else will live there.</LI>
<LI>Herndon, Springfield, Tyson's Corner, and Baltimore are not, and will never be, ""just minutes from downtown.""&nbsp; Those minutes will actually show up in large clumps called hours.</LI>
<LI>If it says ""gated community,"" don't live there.&nbsp; Gates keep crime out in the suburbs, but they keep crime inside in the city.&nbsp; Secured access is always beneficial, however.</LI>
<LI>If the word ""cozy"" comes up, you can strike that housing option as well.&nbsp; ""Cozy"" means no more than 450 sq. feet.&nbsp; Do you really want to live in a dorm room and pay $1500 a month to do so?</LI>
<LI>There really isn't such a thing as a ""sunny basement apartment.""&nbsp; I've visited them.&nbsp; It's hard to have a ""sunny basement apartment"" when there aren't any windows.</LI>
<LI>If you have to list your apartment several times, change the wording a little so it's not noticeable.&nbsp; Those of us who frequently scan the apartments-for-rent pages aren't going to consider a unit that everyone else has been rejecting for weeks.&nbsp; Either conceal the fact you can't find a renter or lower your asking price.</LI>
<LI>Anacostia is a scary, scary place.&nbsp; Don't even pretend to think about it.</LI>
<LI>And this is a big one: I don't care if the place has marble floors, granite countertops, custom cabinets, and your own parking space.&nbsp; Studio apartments are not worth $3000.&nbsp; If you have $3000 to spend on that apartment, you can afford to get into the DC real estate market.&nbsp; Then you can buy your own space, move out, and charge someone else and exorbitant amount in rent.</LI></OL>
<P>I feel better now.</P>
<P>I haven't been motivated to do anything lately.&nbsp; I've been productive in that I have gotten everything done, but I haven't really felt like doing anything except knitting.&nbsp; Once the move is done I'll feel a little bit more relieved, and once the job situation is finalized I know I will have my motivation back, but I still feel apprehensive about the future.&nbsp; Most of the time it's just a wave in my stomach that I can ignore, but other times I feel like nothing is controllable and I just don't know how to succeed.&nbsp; The rational part of me knows exactly how to succeed, and more importantly it knows why I haven't wanted to.&nbsp; I think I'm going back to my to do lists.&nbsp; They kept me on track.</P>
<P>I saw one of my best friends from high school today, totally at random, and I'm ecstatic.&nbsp; I've hated myself ever since I lost touch with her a few years ago, and now I have my chance to keep in touch with her and not lose it again.&nbsp; We're going to do lunch sometime before I go back to DC, or, since that's optimistic because I can't seem to get myself away from my house and my web design projects long enough, when I am back sometime this spring.&nbsp; But it was so nice to see that she's doing so well and that she's happy.&nbsp; I think all I really want for my friends is for them to be happy.&nbsp; Success comes and goes, money comes and goes, fortune comes and goes, but as long as my friends are happy I'm happy too.</P>
<P>I'll be landing in Daytona Beach a week from right now.&nbsp; I'm amazed at how quickly weeks go by around here.</P>"

"event","Every once and a while I run into someone who, in a very quiet way, completely changes my outlook on everything.

The first time this happened was in high school.  My dad and I were eating lunch in Hyannis at a Burger King right after I taught two hour-long sessions on effective communication skills for the Massachusetts Association of Student Councils annual conference.  I was exhausted, my voice was going, and I was a little nervous about the reviews since they were going to tie into how our student council was accredited for the next year.  We were eating our sandwiches, and I noticed one of the guys working there.  He was probably in his 70s, old enough to have retired by then.  He was washing the tables in the back corner, and he was smiling while he worked.  I felt like my heart was going to break while I watched him.  I wondered why he had to work when he should be sitting on a beach in Florida.  I hoped he had a nice family to go home to.  I hope he had a nice life, and we was smiling because he was thinking about it.

Tonight, my mom and I were buying fabric so she can make a tablecloth for a breakfast she's hosting in a few weeks.  The man who was cutting the fabric clearly had a disability of some sort- he had trouble enunciating his words, and we had trouble following what he was saying.  He wanted to know what I was going to make with the yarn I was buying (a puppy), and then he wanted to know if I was going to make it look like a real puppy with a collar and tags.  I told him yes, I was, and told us all about his sister's puppy and how she make it wear sweaters and how he thinks the puppy is humiliated by them.  I hope he has a nice home to go to.  I hope his family is wonderful to him, and I hope he is happy.

I feel like those of us who are most fortunate in this life- the ones who are smart, well-educated, and ambitious enough to take the world by storm- are the ones who are the most unhappy.  I know so many people who I graduated with, or those who have graduated recently, who are so miserable with where they are in life.  Many days out of the week I count myself among them.  But the people we feel sorry for or sometimes ignore completely are the ones who find satisfaction and a place on this planet.  I hope we all find that kind of happiness someday, or at the very least some kind of perspective.  It's something I really want to work on from now on.  When the day is done, in spite of everything that bothers me in this world, I'm OK.  We all are.

I spent most of today with a weird tingling feeling in my stomach, like something new is on the horizon but I can't quite make it out.  I hope it's something good, like a great apartment in a safe neighborhood or a fantastic job that pays six figures a year, but I'm willing to settle for a nice weekend.  Maybe the tingling is optimism, like I'm finally looking forward to things again.  Even if it's not, I think I'll just interpret it that way.

My latest scarf is almost done!  I'll post pictures of it tomorrow... I'm actually kind of proud of it.  Cable stitching was harder than I thought!"

"event","Tonight I was going through apartment review after apartment review, trying to find something near a metro above the ground with a washer and dryer and no rodents that I didn't personally invite in, and I found a place that looked pretty good- 81% of the residents thought it was a great building.  Unfortunately, the two people who didn't give the place rave reviews said it was an unsecure building not safe for young girls.  Damn!  Are there any buildings that are safe for young girls?  I remember asking the Arlington police how I could pick a safe apartment, and the only thing they could tell me was I should live above the ground, get a dog, and live with a man.  Above the ground is totally doable, the dog is a bit expensive, and I'm simply not comfortable living with a guy I'm not dating or related to.  I just don't think living with someone you don't know is OK for someone like me.  It's so frustrating to not be able to gauge your own safety at any given moment.

It was about then, when I was closing browser windows and wondering if I could get myself elected president without ever actually going outside again, that I decided I would keep the place on my list anyway.  What if security were better now?  And it wouldn't get much safer in any other respect... half a block from the train, half a mile from the grocery store, and right near the mall.  If I sit around for the rest of my life crossing things off lists I'll never get on with life.  So there's hope for me yet.  My dream apartment most likely doesn't exist.  I know it doesn't exist... my dream apartment is hidden behind some very tall electric fences and has a moat and a couple of knights on horseback with swords.  (And monkeys with nunchucks... Kerry and I have to have the monkeys with nunchucks).  I'm not stupid enough to take uncalculated risks, but I'm going to have to take a few more risks to move on.  Game plan for tomorrow: phone calls to check on availability.

I went with Heather to check out a new apartment tonight, and while she was filling out the application the leasing agent and I got into a fantastic political discussion.  She was a poli sci graduate last May too, and we had the best talk about the war in Iraq and the journalist who was just kidnapped.  I miss acadamia simply because I miss the debates, the discussions, the exchange of ideas.  I miss throwing out ideas just to see if people can shoot them down or if I can support them well enough to convince people to consider them.  I think I'm going to like grad school more than I thought I would.  I checked out the UCF website today to see if it would seriously be worth my time, and I can do a masters in IR plus an MBA, and there are study abroad options and some fantastic thesis and research things I can do.  I created my thesis idea last year, and I could actually make it happen in grad school.  And there are plenty of ways to make it affordable so I don't have to go into debt at all.  It was just really surprising to have such an in-depth discussion with someone at random.  It was refreshing to find out that my brain is still processing things and is still capable of intelligent discussion from time to time.

I'm really jealous of everyone who can fall asleep at a normal time.  I can't fall asleep before 2 no matter what I have to do the next day or what time I have to get up.  Much as I try to enjoy it, since my days of freedom are certainly numbered, I would love to be tired around 11.  Then again, all of the best TV is on late at night.  Daria is on from 1:30 to 2... I would be so happy if that would come out on DVD.  My video tapes with the marathon from the week before Eric went to college are a little old now, and I'm afraid they are going to fall apart before the DVDs come out.  Man, you know it's late when you start rattling on about TV shows..."

"event","<P>I got some (good) news about the trial today, and I wrote an entry about it which is friends only.&nbsp; I know there are a lot of people who don't have an LJ account but are certainly welcome to read it- let me know if you want to be added as a friend or you want to know what's going on (you can leave comments even if you don't have an LJ).&nbsp; I just didn't want to make this a public thing... not that I'm keeping it a secret, but it's very personal to me and I don't need everyone on the world wide web reading it.</P>
<P>**************</P>
<P>In other news, for those of you who are into this sort of thing, Oprah has announced her next Book Club selection is <A href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374500010/sr=53-1/ref=tr_17911/103-8254712-1449416?n=283155"">Night by Elie Wiesel</A>.&nbsp; Way back in the day, when I was in eighth grade, Mr. Tarlin (who some of you will remember as one of the most awesome English teachers ever) let me borrow his copy of the <A href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374521409/sr=1-2/qid=1137561114/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-8254712-1449416?%5Fencoding=UTF8"">Night trilogy</A> over the summer.&nbsp; Aside from the fact I was beyond flattered that he would lend me one of his favorite pieces of his personal book collection, the story was enticing and emotional.&nbsp; I could gush on and on about it, but if I did you would probably waste time reading this thing instead of buying your copy and reading it.&nbsp; It's that good.&nbsp; I read a lot, and this book is worth picking up even if you're in the middle of another one.&nbsp; I'm usually not a fan of Oprah's book club because I think having everyone read the same thing at the same time can make the whole concept of coming to your own conclusions about literature a bit too commercial, but I'll forgive it this once.&nbsp; However, I will say this this particular novel will probably affect everyone in a different way... it's one thing to read fuzzy chick lit (which I am definitely guilty of reading), but it's another to read something real and honest.&nbsp; It's haunting in a beautiful way.</P>
<P>So go read it and tell me when you do... it's totally worth it.</P>"

"event","<P>Looking for an apartment is a full time job.&nbsp; Looking for a job is a full time job.&nbsp; Working, as you might guess, is a full time job.&nbsp; That's probably why I am so wound up all the time.&nbsp; That's also why my coffee and tea intake has grown exponentially in the last, oh, month or so.</P>
<P>I'm not going to waste my time trashing apartments, management, and pricing- if you talk to me on even a semi-regular basis, you already know my thoughts on all of those topics.&nbsp; But I will say that I am endlessly shocked by how a place can be so insanely expensive and still manage to be crime-ridden and disgusting.&nbsp; I know that my safety requirements are a whole lot greater than most people's, but I'm amazed at where someone will choose to live and the abuse they are willing to take to save a few bucks.&nbsp; I know what it's like to not have a lot of money and to want to spend as little on housing and utilities as possible, but you shouldn't have to live next door to a gang member and across the hall from a protsitute to do it.&nbsp; I'm not making that scenario up.&nbsp; You shouldn't have to risk your life walking a block and a half to the metro in broad daylight.&nbsp; Roaches and rats shouldn't be allowed into your apartment without signing a lease.&nbsp; Needless to say, I didn't find my dream apartment this weekend.&nbsp; I did, however, find it listed when I turned my computer on several hundred miles away.&nbsp; Damn damn damn.&nbsp; Now I just have to hope it's still around next weekend.</P>
<P>I'm kind of concerned I missed my true calling in life, which would have been somewhere in the field of web development.&nbsp; I mentioned to my dad that freshman year I had made up a homepage for myself, where I displayed stupid things like pictures of people and poems.&nbsp; My dad asked if I remembered html, and then he asked if I could code his company's website.&nbsp; It's already been designed, so I just have to get it up and running.&nbsp; Then, my dad mentioned to someone at the local cable studio that I was going to do his website, and next thing I know I have a website design project.&nbsp; Then that person tells someone else about it, and I have a third project to do.&nbsp; I'm kind of happy because they will be easy maintenance projects, a couple of hours a week tops (after the initial startup work), and it will be enough to cover all of my expenses outside of rent and utilities.&nbsp; Things are looking up.&nbsp; I just picked the wrong major.&nbsp; Then again, if I had gone with my initial instinct I would have been a directing major.</P>
<P>I think the Daytona trip is officially on, and that's a good thing.&nbsp; I get to see Eric for our 8th anniversary (!!!), we're going to see Arlo Guthrie, and I add another trip to my agenda and keep up with my New Years resolution to get out more.&nbsp; I'll probably go back to Daytona in March, and that will be an easy trip because that's right after United starts running direct flights from Dulles to Daytona Beach.&nbsp; I hate connections with a passion.&nbsp; It seems like they are either so far apart it adds half a day to my trip or they are really close together and I am inevitably delayed, which means I miss the connection and have to wait for another flight, adding another half a day to my trip.</P>
<P>I have to wake up in 4 hours to take Kaiti to Farmington, and this mostly pointless entry was to help me wind down so I can sleep.&nbsp; It didn't work.&nbsp; So instead of coming up with more useless stuff to write about, I'm going to read for a change.&nbsp; I've actually done a lot of reading lately (I really miss my books in storage though...).&nbsp; For any history fans out there, check out <EM>What Ifs of American History</EM>.&nbsp; Historians take events from history (i.e. the Mayflower, the Civil War) and look for the counterfactuals- what if the Mayflower had wound up in Virginia as planned, or what if the South really did seceed?&nbsp; It's so cool to read about that stuff... I wish I had found more theoretical history classes in school.&nbsp; Professor Eisenberg did a good job with the what ifs, but there were so many other classes where we should have discussed them more.&nbsp; I'm definitely taking that into account when I look for grad programs.&nbsp; Actually, counterfactuals will be a huge part of my thesis... man, I should really apply to grad school.&nbsp; I think my burnout phase is ending and I'm ready to start formally learning again. :-)</P>"

"event","I had all of these big dreams that this year I wouldn't fill this journal with fluffy ""this is how I spent my times"" entries, but last weekend was a lot of fun so I have to write the obligatory ""this is how I spent my weekend"" entry.  Maybe later I'll write an opinionated entry on the state of US political affairs or something like that... you know, something to show my brain is still working months after classes ended.

Last weekend was Meg's wedding, and it was beautiful.  If I could have dreamed up what Meg's wedding would look like, I would have been surprisingly on target.  Every detail was perfect, everything was delicious, everything was well-coordinated, but most of all it came together as if it were effortless, like everything just fit together in the end.  It was the kind of stress-free event where the guests actually had a good time and relaxed and enjoyed the day.  I'm sure it wasn't as perfect as I make it sound, since the planning process is long and tedious and things come together last minute (as with all big events), but as a guest it was easy to just get lost in the moment and have fun.  I figure it must have been a great wedding since I actually don't like weddings very much, and I loved this one.  I'm even sad it's over (although I'm ectastic for Meg and Dave!) since that's one more fun event in the past.  I think I like the time before good things happen more than I do any other time.  I love the anticipation and the excitement.  When it's happening it happens so quickly, and when it's over it loses some luster.  Maybe that's why I don't mind waiting for my own wedding.  It, too, will be wonderful and fun and perfect, and I like keeping it on the horizon where it's always going to be something to anticipate and be excited for.

We created a sort of after party at Sig Tau, and that was also a lot of fun.  I sort of wish I were good at pong, but in reality I'm only good at drinking beer so I did.  Truthfully, I would be good at pong if I ever played.  But I don't like doing things that require ""skill"" in front of other people before I get good at them.  I'm self-conscious about everything I do, and I can't let that go.  Not even when everyone else is drunk apparently.  So pong will always be one of those games I don't play.  We did play flip cup though, and I actually participated in that one.  I like being an alum a lot more than I did being an undergrad.  I never had a great time because I was wrapped up in papers I should be writing or meetings I needed to be sober for the next day.  Now that my responsibilities are somewhat limited I can actually enjoy myself once and a while.  But I want to hang on to that when I go back to DC... I mean, how many fresh starts do you get in life?

One other thing: we walked by Tridelt, and that made me feel better than I have in a long time.  I loved being a part of that house, and I have a lot of great memories there.  It sort of restored some of the safety I haven't been able to find.  The pieces I have left to reclaim are wide-reaching apparently, but they're still there and I'll get to them in time.  But man I miss that place every once and a while...

Some pictures:

So yes.  Great weekend.  Congrats to Meg and Dave, yay for seeing a lot of people I have missed, and yay for meeting some awesome new people (particularly those from Boston and DC!).  I'm glad that was my first 2006 weekend... you know, start the year off on the right foot."

"event","<P>I actually changed my mind on the whole new year's resolutions thing.&nbsp; Most of my past new year's resolutions have revolved around something that involves a lot of work and committment (i.e. losing weight, eating better, getting a 4.0, saving money).&nbsp; This year, I am going to make some resolutions that help me take better care of the less practical side to me.&nbsp; So here's what I've settled on:</P>
<P><STRONG>01.</STRONG> Travel more.<BR><STRONG>02.</STRONG> Knit that awesome sweater from my Knitting for Dummies book.<BR><STRONG>03.</STRONG> Write more often.<BR><STRONG>04.</STRONG> Keep in touch with my friends.<BR><STRONG>05.</STRONG> Indulge.<BR><STRONG>06.</STRONG> Drive.</P>
<P>And since no resolution should be made without a game plan, I established some of those too.</P>
<P><STRONG>01.</STRONG> My 2006 travel plans:<BR>- 01/05: Pittsburgh<BR>- 01/14ish: DC<BR>- 01/21ish: DC (this time to stay!)<BR>- 01/31ish: Daytona Beach<BR>- 03/01ish: Daytona Beach<BR>- 07/15ish: Maine<BR>- 07/26ish: Bermuda!!!<BR>- 12/25ish: Hopefully Italy and Greece<BR><STRONG>02.</STRONG> I'm knitting the sweater after I finish the current scarf.&nbsp; And for Mariena: it's the cute one with the detatchable sleeves. :-)<BR><STRONG>03.</STRONG> I'm going back to the word a day thing where I would get a word a day email and write a page based on that word.&nbsp; I had some pretty awesome stuff when I was doing that a few years ago.<BR><STRONG>04.</STRONG> More emails, more phone calls.&nbsp; I don't use AIM that much for communication, but I could be better at letting people know how I am and finding out how they are.&nbsp; I miss everyone a lot, and I shouldn't have let last year stop me from reaching out to people.<BR><STRONG>05</STRONG>. I'm starting with the spa gift certificate Eric gave me and going from there.&nbsp; It wouldn't kill me to spend a few bucks on a manicure or something every once and a while.&nbsp; And I'm going to more museums and happy hours.&nbsp; I want to have more fun.<BR><STRONG>06.</STRONG> I'm buying a car and driving it.&nbsp; I'm a grown-up now, and if I want to buy a car and drive I can do it.&nbsp; I will also stop being afraid of driving because it's not that hard, and I'm a good driver.</P>
<P>Writing those words makes me feel very optimistic about the upcoming year.&nbsp; I have a lot to look forward to.</P>"

"event","<P>Another quiz.&nbsp; I might have lied about the reflections thing I mentioned last time, since these quizzes seem to lay almost everything on the line.&nbsp; Some questions are the same, but some answers are not.</P>
<P>Was 2005 a good year for you?<BR>Oddly enough, sort of.&nbsp; I was prepared to say on a scale from one to ten it was about a negative 50, but to recap (briefly) I managed to make it past every obstacle and brick wall in my way.&nbsp; And I'm still here to talk about it, to write about it, so I can't say it was a wasted year.&nbsp; In some ways it was a good year because of what I learned about myself and others, but from all other vantage points it wasn't all that great.</P>
<P>What was your favorite moment of the year?<BR>Graduating was good, and finding out I was the commencement speaker was good too.&nbsp; I think Eric showing up unexpectedly for the whole thing was the best.</P>
<P>What was your least favorite moment of the year?<BR>I'm going to pick the moment that guy came crashing through my window.&nbsp; I'll never forget it, and it will be a while before I get over it.&nbsp; The rest of the night pales in comparison to that one second.</P>
<P>What did you do in 2005 that you had never done before?<BR>I got my own apartment.&nbsp; And I coordinated my very first move.&nbsp; Obviously it was not my last.</P>
<P>Where were you when 2005 began?<BR>Home in Massachusetts</P>
<P>Who were you with?<BR>My parents since Eric had to go back to Daytona, and I didn't feel like making other plans.&nbsp; Wallowing in self pity seemed like a good idea at the time.</P>
<P>Where will you be when 2005 ends?<BR>A party somewhere, but that's all still up in the air unfortunately.</P>
<P>Who will you be with when 2005 ends?<BR>Not entirely sure, but very likely with Heather and Kerry and other people.</P>
<P>Did you keep your new years resolution of 2005?<BR>I didn't make any.&nbsp; I used to make them and either forget or set standards I couldn't possibly meet, or I would pick something so large that it was impossible to even know how to begin (i.e. ""contribute to world peace"" or ""make the world a better place"").</P>
<P>Do you have a new years resolution for 2006?<BR>Nope.</P>
<P>Did you fall in love in 2005?<BR>Yup.&nbsp; As usual.</P>
<P>If yes, with who?<BR>Eric</P>
<P>If yes, do they know?<BR>That would be a safe bet.</P>
<P>Are you still in love with them?<BR>Yes.</P>
<P>Do you regret it?<BR>No.</P>
<P>Did you break-up with anyone in 2005?<BR>I haven't broken up with someone since the 90s.</P>
<P>Did you make any new friends in 2005?<BR>Yes.&nbsp; I also got closer to a lot of people I had known before but not as well as I did as the year went on.</P>
<P>Who are your favorite new friends?<BR>I hate playing favorites, but Lacey, Mariena, Becca, and my Arlington neighbors are on the list.</P>
<P>What was your favorite month of 2005?<BR>March.&nbsp; March was a wonderful month.</P>
<P>Did you travel outside of the USA in 2005?<BR>Nope.&nbsp; But I think I want to travel somewhere in 2006.&nbsp; Maybe Italy or an island somewhere around the end of July...</P>
<P>How many different states did you travel to in 2005?<BR>Hmmm... Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, and Florida.&nbsp; Not really an impressive travel year.</P>
<P>Did you lose anybody close to you in 2005?<BR>Mrs. Wiesenfeld, Uncle Jimmy, and Grandma.&nbsp; It was a tough year for my family.</P>
<P>Did you miss anybody in the past year?<BR>I think I missed everyone at some point.&nbsp; I missed my family and MA friends when I was in PA and DC, I missed my friends after graduation, and I missed everyone in the months that followed.&nbsp; But it was nice to have so many people to miss and so many people who missed me.</P>
<P>What was your favorite movie that you saw in 2005?<BR><EM>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</EM> was awesome.</P>
<P>What was your favorite song from 2005?<BR>""Sleeps with Butterflies"" by Tori Amos, which came along at exactly the right moment.</P>
<P>What was your favorite record(s) from 2005?:<BR><EM>The Beekeeper</EM> by Tori Amos, hands down.</P>
<P>How many concerts did you see in 2005?<BR>None.&nbsp; I'm not much for concerts because I hate crowded, smokey atmospheres, but I think that might change when I get back into the club scene in DC.</P>
<P>Did you have a favorite concert in 2005?<BR>Apparently not.</P>
<P>Did you drink a lot of alcohol in 2005?<BR>Why, yes I did.&nbsp; But I was 21 for half the year, which means I had to enjoy my new freedom, and after my 22nd birthday everything went upside-down so ""drink to forget"" became a motto every once and a while.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; Actually, one of the fun parts of being home was going out for a drink with my dad.&nbsp; And another great moment was having beers with Heather, Sarah, John and John a few months ago.</P>
<P>Did you do a lot of drugs in 2005?<BR>Nope.&nbsp; I've never done any kind of drug.</P>
<P>How many people did you love in 2005?<BR>Romantically, just one.&nbsp; But in total dozens... maybe hundreds.</P>
<P>Did you do anything you are ashamed of this year? <BR>Not exactly... some things I would do differently, but nothing I was ashamed of per se.</P>
<P>What was the worst lie someone told you in 2005?<BR>I'm not sure.</P>
<P>Did you treat somebody badly in 2005?<BR>Yes.&nbsp; And in all honesty, it was directly because of the emotional distress I was under.&nbsp; And that's not an excuse, just a reason.&nbsp; And I'm still very sorry.</P>
<P>What was the best thing you bought in 2005?<BR>Yarn and the Alf DVDs.&nbsp; And my plane tickets to Pittsburgh, because starting the year off in a place I remember as safe will be a great late Christmas present to myself.</P>
<P>Did somebody treat you badly in 2005?<BR>Yes, but all is forgiven.&nbsp; Not forgotten unfortunately.&nbsp; I'm not that good.</P>
<P>How much money did you spend in 2005?<BR>Thousands... most of it in moving and storage.</P>
<P>What was your proudest moment of 2005?<BR>Giving the commencement speech.&nbsp; And facing that guy in court and realizing I was going to get myself through it all.</P>
<P>If you could go back in time to any moment of 2005?<BR>Laying on the beach in Tarpon Springs.&nbsp; It was a kind of peace I can't have again.</P>
<P>What are your plans for 2006?<BR>New apartment, new roommate, new job, new friends, new start.&nbsp; Same great friends, same desire to keep my head up and face whatever the future brings.</P>
<P>Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:<BR><EM>They say you were something in those formative years<BR>Hold on to nothing as fast as you can<BR>Still... pretty good year</EM></P>"

"event","<P>2005 will probably take a while to properly dissect, so I have decided to do it via a series of quizzes and random thoughts interjected with lessons learned and knowledge gained.&nbsp; I'll start with a quiz I did back on xanga right after the new year, just after I got to DC for my second internship.&nbsp; If you want to see where I was last year at this time, the nice people at xanga haven't shut down my journal so it's there in all of its glory.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>2005: Year in Review</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>1. What did you do in 2005 that you'd never done before? </P>
<P>I stopped being a student for the first time since I was five.&nbsp; I also went to court for the first time.</P>
<P>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? </P>
<P>I was true to my word and didn't make any resolutions.&nbsp; Actually, I had joked that my resolutions were not to get married, not to get pregnant, and not to get killed.&nbsp; Oh how simple those seemed at the time... well, the one that seemed most simply was the one that got compromised.</P>
<P>3. Did anyone close to you give birth? </P>
<P>Marie had AJ, plus two of my mom's co-workers had babies this week!</P>
<P>4. Did anyone close to you die? </P>
<P>February: Mrs. Wiesenfeld, March: Uncle Jimmy, May: Grandma.&nbsp; This was a really rough year.</P>
<P>5. What countries did you visit? </P>
<P>I stayed in the USA the whole year.&nbsp; Travelling was not on the agenda.</P>
<P>6. What would you like to have in 2006 that you lacked in 2005?</P>
<P>A renewed sense of safety, and a renewed sense of confidence.&nbsp; Both of those were crushed this year, but at least my confidence seems to have sparked a bit lately.</P>
<P>7. What date from 2005 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? </P>
<P>May 15, 2005.&nbsp; Graduation... that's been etched on my mind since it was announced a few years ago.<BR>July 26, 2005.&nbsp; The day everything went upside-down.&nbsp; Every day since has been an uphill battle.<BR>July 29, 2005.&nbsp; The day that guy got caught and I got the phone call.<BR>September 1, 2005.&nbsp; The day I found out I was a finalist at the LOC, and the day I decided I was going to be OK.</P>
<P>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? </P>
<P>The LOC interview, and completing RAD.</P>
<P>9. What was your biggest failure? </P>
<P>Not letting myself grieve after I got back home.&nbsp; It all came full circle in the end, but I should have recognized that it was OK to take some time to just breathe instead of being strong for everyone else.</P>
<P>10. Did you suffer illness or injury? </P>
<P>Aside from the emotional stuff, I do have a cold right now... but Nyquil is a wonderful thing.</P>
<P>11. What was the best thing you bought? </P>
<P>For me: my Break the Silence bracelet and yarn, because knitting is the best hobby ever.<BR>For others: My mom's christmas present (a necklace)</P>
<P>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</P>
<P>I still don't get this question.&nbsp; I don't think I have ever celebrated someone's behavior before.</P>
<P>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? </P>
<P>The guy who attacked me tops the list, but there are a few people out there who are really kind of vile.&nbsp; But I don't think about them anymore, so I don't think they appalled or depressed me that much.</P>
<P>14. Where did most of your money go? </P>
<P>Moving and storage.&nbsp; Oh the money sunk into moving and storage... although some of that will come back in a few months.</P>
<P>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about? </P>
<P>Graduation, starting work, time with my girls, visiting Eric, and spending the holidays with PK for the first time ever!</P>
<P>16. What song will always remind you of 2005? </P>
<P>Starry Eyed Surprise, no question</P>
<P>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:<BR>Happier or sadder? About the same... very happy<BR>Older or wiser? Both.&nbsp; I'm not the same girl I used to be.<BR>Thinner or fatter? Thinner!&nbsp; Finally!<BR>Richer or poorer? Poorer until my reimbursements come though...</P>
<P>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</P>
<P>Spending time with college friends... I miss the opportunities I had to hang out with them, but I'm really grateful I haven't lost touch with them!</P>
<P>19. What do you wish you'd done less of? </P>
<P>Worrying about things I can't change or control</P>
<P>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</P>
<P>I spent Christmas Day playing with my new computer and knitting and talking to people on the phone... I didn't want to leave my house.</P>
<P>21. Did you fall in love in 2004? </P>
<P>New year, same love. :-)</P>
<P>22. How many one-night stands? </P>
<P>None.</P>
<P>23. Do you have any regrets?</P>
<P>A couple, but I also have a heightened sense of dealing with mistakes made and making results happen no matter what obstacles there are.</P>
<P>24. What was your favorite TV program?</P>
<P>Boston Legal, and the new Family Guy episodes are hilarious (and many are now on DVD!)</P>
<P>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</P>
<P>I don't hate anyone.&nbsp; But there are a few people who are absolutely not as cool as they advertise themselves to be...</P>
<P>26. What was the best book you read? </P>
<P><EM>Breaking My Cover</EM> by Lindsay Moran, which reminded me why I decided the CIA isn't for me (and, thankfully, why the State Department isn't for me either... right now)</P>
<P>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</P>
<P>Depending on my mood, Jonatha Brooke and Billy Joel (he was more of a rediscovery)</P>
<P>28. What did you want and get? </P>
<P>Happiness</P>
<P>29. What did you want and not get? </P>
<P>My first great chance... it was dangled in front of me a few times, but it just was never completely there.</P>
<P>30. What was your favorite film of this year? </P>
<P>I can't even tell you the last time I went to the movies... 40 Year Old Virgin was practically the only movie I saw, and that was on DVD last week.&nbsp; But I'll go with that.</P>
<P>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? </P>
<P>I turned 22.&nbsp; I spent the first part of the day in Maine and the second part of the day in Massachusetts.&nbsp; There was little celebration since I had just gotten home and I wasn't entirely up for it... it was mostly a day for quiet reflection.&nbsp; My second birthday, the one in the Macy's parking lot, was much better.</P>
<P>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? </P>
<P>If that guy had never broken in, I think things would have been more satisfying by a lot.</P>
<P>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2005?</P>
<P>The first part of the year I tried to stay true to my classic tastes, and the second part of the year has been mixing and matching the few articles of clothing not currently in storage.</P>
<P>34. What kept you sane? </P>
<P>Eric, my parents, Kaiti, Nancy, my friends... I couldn't have made it through without a single one of them.</P>
<P>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</P>
<P>Martha Stewart.&nbsp; I mean, she was in prison, and now she's back on TV.&nbsp; That's pretty intense.</P>
<P>36. What political issue stirred you the most? </P>
<P>The war pissed me off a lot... the supreme court nominations ticked me off, too.</P>
<P>37. Who did you miss?</P>
<P>Eric, although I saw him a lot this year.</P>
<P>38. Who was the best new person you met?</P>
<P>My neighbor in DC was awesome.&nbsp; When I'm back on my feet, I owe her a beer.&nbsp; Or at least a hug.</P>
<P>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2005: </P>
<P>Stay calm, stay alert, and keep yourself open to whatever happens.&nbsp; You can't predict it, you can't control it, but you can make the best out of whatever comes your way.</P>
<P>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</P>
<P>Same as always: <BR>They say you were something in those formative years<BR>Well hold on to nothing as fast as you can<BR>Still, pretty good year</P>"

"event","I really like traditions.  In a world that is chaotic and unpredictable, it's nice to know there are certain things you can count on.  I know that on December 23rd I will spend the evening with Kaiti, Eric, Jeremy and Julie, and we will exchange gifts and watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  I know that the weekend after Thanksgiving is always spent shopping with my Thong-a-Thoners.  I know that I will always reread my journal entries at the end of the year so I can see how I changed and remember what happened.

2005 was a horrible year.

It's still a little early for me to think about the year as a whole, but I was rereading my entries tonight and realized that now more than ever I want to put the past as far behind me as I can.  This is a particularly hard year to put in the past, especially since its remnants will invariably stretch into 2006.  Nonetheless, in an effort to live and learn, I made all of my 2005 entries private.  I don't want to erase the past (no good writer would!), but I don't need to read about it all the time.  And neither do you.  Some of it might pop up again from time to time, but all in all 2005 is almost over and I'll leave it at that.  Besides, I hate being pessimistic.  It's such a downer.

So anyway, on with the show.  With the exception of my traditional end-of-the-year recap, it's on to bigger and better things for me.  And yes, I considered forgoing the whole end-of-the-year recap, but that seemed unfair in a way.  And besides, I really like traditions."

"event","So I will attempt to keep this short while I have a few fleeting moments.

Since my last update:

Working the 5AM shift. I dont know what god I pissed off to be stuck with this again. Last time I had it I survived, but am going to try and see how well I do this time. =(

Went to a Norah Jones Concert. <3 She is so beautiful, and I am so in love with her voice. Ended up going up to see her in Portland with the redhead.

Been spending a lot of time with the afore mentioned redhead, and believe it or not, I actually have a Girlfriend at this point. Strangest note is that the last time I had anything ""Official"" was high school. I know I sound like a teenage dork, but what ya gonna do. Tis nice being able to spend time with someone on a frequent (read: not overwhelming) basis, and enjoy company, chat, and just have a good time. 

Started listening to more random music. Been torturing friends (both online and in person) with the stylings of Ween. Truly odd stuff, but verra good.

Have plans to go to Southern California in December. In that time, I will visit with my Bro, Watch Nikki get married, Meet <lj user=vimka> and <lj user=jaguar_lady>, Visit with another one of my random friends from up here who eventually wound up down there, and even see what is left of my friends down there. =D

One of my crazy ""exes"" got a hold of me. Just to tell me she had spawned. Yippie. This being the same one that wanted to marry me on my 22nd birthday. One of those really random things that makes an interesting conversation peice that I did not think much about aside from mentioning the crazy to my friends. And then I get another random call from my past...

One of my Little Sister types (Morgin) called to chat with me, and in her updates, she is married and has a kid. This being one of the people who went to school with 5/6. She also informed me I have an ass-kicking due if I go down to SoCal and dont visit her.

Back and neck. Still sucking. Appointment to see a chiropractor on the 22nd, and start down the road to maybe do something not destructive to my body. We shall see.

That just about sums it up. So um yeah... more updates when I can or think about it.

<lj user=annaanna> - You have always been a good friend. Thanks for being there for me and verbally assaulting me when I need it (which is most of the time). You know I love you to death, and with any luck, I will strangle you out of sheer Ire, as I have promised so many times when you and I dont see eye to eye on things.

<lj user=hellsdove> - Darling, I know you will prolly never check these entries, or if you do, you will remind me that I have still not ranted on the salads. Then again, you have known me for long enough to know my attention span for everything, including my rants are pretty bad. I blame the shiny objects that keep distracting me.

<lj user=clevman> - Dammit Jason, Be on IM more often! I want to catch up with you more often, and see how you are doing, BS about our gaming habits, and exchange awesome music! That, and I eventually want my anime back XD I miss Dragon Half >.>

<lj user=dianaserra> - Fox, HHGG kicks ass. Have been quite entertained by the amount of random quotes from that awesome piece of work by Douglas Adams. You also need to spend more time in game. =p Those cons that you go to, I love hearing about. Kinda makes me wish I could do the same.

<lj user=infliction7> - My fave lil emo taru. Your emoticons make me smile always. Never lose that level of... well... you! I would be sad if one day I could not see the Crayon thing you do, or didnt hear ""STFU Kyrei!""

<lj user=jaguar_lady> - One day my dear. One day we shall meet. I truly truly wonder what the would will do on that day. Mwahahahahaha! I suspect there will be a lot of clawing, scratching, howling, and purring. Then we shall see what happens after your cat decides if I am likable. (What? You thought something else? Frigging perverts.)

<lj user=mynameisrivers> - You have great thoughts, a wonderful imagination, and your heart desires to help people. I am glad to have met you, and always look forward to reading your thoughts.

<lj user=vimka> - Ah yes. My loyal lieutenant. You will be well rewarded for serving me loyally. And you shall be rewarded even greater when you bring me the heads of my enemies. Additional rewards if you bring me their heads on a stake. We shall call it Enemy Head-kabob. Another truly good person I am glad to have met. Oh yes... there will be a way to get you up here, and have you as entertained as I.

Lil Sis - Dammit! Get an LJ account! You dont need to update it, just have it handy so you can have the cool icons on hand when you update our Journals with comments! Am happy to have you around, as you make me smile. And you will listen to your Onii-san bitch about, well, whatever I am in a ranting mood for. =p Much love to ya, hope the hurricanes realize they are not match for your forces of nature, and if you call me up at 2am, I swear I will paddle you!


So those are my thoughts for now. {Um...} I look forward to seeing some responses. So yeah... Lates."

<i>Simple and true, your angst is just the amount of any normal person. What's more, you exercise an extremely honest and healthy way of dealing with it. Many people could use maturity and wisdom like yours. Your angst may be that you don't get along with your boss or a family member is having health problems, but either way it's always something transient and survivable that you cope with and use as a step on your way to becoming a better person. If there's one problem with your angsting, it's that you may tend to take this matter-of-fact, dutiful approach to all things. Maybe you should cut loose a little now and then so you can have some wild fun and adventure to balance out your angst. Remember that life needs its up as well as its downs and treat yourself to a little reward for your work. </i>

Hmmn... Pretty close."

"event","Just got back from running to lunch. Actually conversation taken from before I ran out:

Me: Heading to VRC. You guys want anything?
Bossman: Nope. I'm good.
Bastard: Why would I want anything from there? The only thing there is 13 year old girls, the food court, and video games.
Me: Yup. And I am picking up 2 of those. 
*dead silence*

I sometimes wonder if I should care about those random social interactions, and how they may view me, but really? Meh. My bossman kicks ass, and I have him hooked on many of the webcomics I read. As for the bastard? Well, he's a bastard. Cool guy, long stories on that nickname, but will tell another time.

So I head to VRC with 2 things in mind: Orange Chicken from Panda Express, and Phantom Brave for the PS/2. I wind up finding another game I want (Castlevania: Lament of Innocence for those who would like to know), and chat with the guy at the counter:

Counter-guy: You'll have to tell me how that game is *points to Phantom Brave*
Me: Yeah. I think it'll be a while before I get a chance to play the game. Most of my time is taken up by other games. Am 100 hours into Disgaea, started La Puecelle Tactics, and my current crack is FFXI.
Counter-guy: Really? What server you on?

And it kinda breaks down into the discussions on ffxi, different servers, characters, and all the stuff you expect to chat about with other people who play as well. I think what kinda set me off on this thought/rant was the look someone else who was picking up a game (some sports game I think?) gave me when I mentioned I AOE-Death Giddeus. 

<i>Side note: Just got off the phone with someone who has a DHL connection he was asking about. I am wondering if he is planning on shipping the packets overnight delivery. </i>

This guy looks at me with this sort of disgust, like he is a better person, or is not as (lacking in other word) nerdy/geeky/whatever as I am cuz he is getting a sport game, and I play ""those"" games. Serious.

I play video games. La-de-fricking dah. I am a 24 year old gamer geek. My main interests in life is girls and games. Yeah, quite the irony there, right? I'll update more later (promise). I have to pay attenion to work."

"event","I have a problem ({lie} I have several, but this rant is about one, maybe two). Tis an odd one, but since when did anyone expect anything normal from me. I have a problem accepting things.

Compliments, gifts, advice, critique.

<b>Compliments:</b>
People say nice things about me, and I kinda brush it off. Dunno if it is cuz I dont think I deserve it, I dont think it is true, or I suspect they have ulterior motives to what they say. Or even I think the compliment is a thinly-veiled insult. Couple instances come to mind, actually several, so I have decided against going into too much detail. That whole ""trying to keep updates small"" effort. ;)
A few people have said recently that I have a nice voice. Granted, mainly female, but I can never tell how serious they are. One managed to call me while I was waking up (and will prolly be posting a comment to harass me =p), and another surprised the heck out of me (and will also prolly be posting a comment as well).
Do I not accept it because I do not believe it is true? Maybe a little. I know I happen to enjoy singing loudly in my car while I drive, but in the shower or milling about the house? notsomuch.
Maybe I am like that QC comic, and expect worship. XD

<b>Gifts:</b>
Who does not like to receive? I personally love to both give and receive. Knock it off you perverts! I like doing nice things for people, and that will sometimes involve getting them something nice. Or I'll see something and go ""You know, this would be perfect for them"" and just pick it up. No reason other then that. A funny T-Shirt, a gag keychain, random CD. Hell, I like burning mix CDs for people if only for the reason I like sharing my musical tastes. But someone giving an item to me for no reason? {Hmmn...}
I just do not receive as well as I give. I say once again, Knock it off you pervs! I think I would actually risk offending someone sooner then accepting a gift I don't feel I deserve.

<b>Advice:</b>
OK. Advice I take really well. I should say I listen to advice really well. Implement it? Yeah... I dunno about that. So often I ask friends for advice and feedback, and then I wind up doing something stupid, completely ignoring/disregarding the good aspects of it, or doing the complete opposite.
Some of you have heard me talk about the 2AM-ers. I get advice from close friends (albeit male, but I digress) to just give them what they want.
Drama {Do you need it?} {No Thanks.}
Others say cut the line completely. Either of these can be considered good advice, but while I listen, I dont implement it.

<b>Critique:</b>
I think I take this better then any of the others above. Am not trying to sound like a whiny bitch (ohmygoth! so pitiful!) but it is easier to internally believe that I need to change something, while being externally offended. Is that not an odd twist? Yet, I, Like most others are picky what I will take critique about. Someone says I could stand to loosen up a little bit, they are prolly right. But heaven forbid if anyone critiques my skills (omg... why are you giggling like mad? are you twelve or something? I swear you people are pervs!) then there is hell to pay. This one is a big note of mine at work, when a customer will critique (actually most of the time insult) my abilities, and I'll do everything I can to remain professional.
I think it was <lj user=vimka> who was telling me about the 2 types of angry people. The guy who comes into the convenience store to bitch the clerk out for the price of milk, and the convenience store clerk that takes it.
I would like to think I have a pretty high threshold for other people's bullshit, but I will admit my trigger is when someone insults something I have worked hard towards.

Mehr! Considering I also have been multitasking while writing this entry, I will leave a mental note for another update. People who want help, but are unwilling to help themselves.

Anycase. Toodles all. More updates as I have time and think about it."

"event","So I just ran into <lj user=annaanna>, and she makes some comment about my hair getting long. 


Me: ""That's kinda the point of growing it out. . . ""
Anna: ""Well it is getting long enough that you can pull it back!""
Me: ""I stand by my previous statement. I am kinda hoping to get it grown out to the point where I can pull all of it back.""
Anna: ""You should cut your hair.""
Me: ""No.""
Anna: ""Why not?""
Me: ""No.""
Anna: ""Oh come on!""
Me:  ""I remember what it looked like when it was short. That is why not.""
Anna: ""It looked good.""
Me: ""Um... yeah... uh-huh... hmmn.... no.""


Strangely, this is how most of the conversations with her and I go. Love the girl to death, and we are still pretty close friends. An odd friendship, one which most of the time involves the two of us utterly frustrating each other, but still, we're there for each other. If she ever updates her journal, or checks her friends list, she may see this, but I think.... hmmn... notsomuch. =p

So methinks I should get some feedback. Whatcha all think of the topic of long hair vs. short hair? If I have time tonight, I'll see about posting a recent pic of me with my hair at the current length, and then find the pic that was taken a few days after I got it dramatically cut like 2 years ago.

*twitch twitch* I may mark that update as private, since I am more then a little bashful, and get the feeling that <lj user=jaguar_lady> is already preparing to photoshop the pics. Added bonus: That may prompt the anonymous lil sis to get signed up for a LiveJournal account. =p


Till then, quick review of to do list:

Reservations for Friday Night - Done
Plan Itenerary for trip to SoCal in December - Rough Draft
Get some projects at work done - . . . Maybe this week. (I have to wonder if my boss is trolling my LJ) -_-;;
Brief house-ninjas about recent changes - I'll get to it. Of course, that would explain where Trouble disappeared to. =0
Get back into Mixed Martial Arts and the Gym downstairs - Technically, I go to the Gym twice a week, if only to get my back worked on by the LMT.
Plot to take over the world - My Favorite Minion is MIA; Ninjas depressed; am in need of more lieutenants. This could push my plans back a bit. . ."

But today, this comic stood out at me:

http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=177

I love Questionable Content. There are days where it mimic's my life (Cept I am by NO stretch of the mind an emo-kid), and most days where I wish for an Anthropomorphic PC with a friggin laser in it. 

For the Guys, how many of you have girl friends like that?
For the Girls, how many of you will admit to being that girl? *ducks*


""Aerodynamically Curvaceous"" is another QC-ism. I like that expression. Tis perfect for describing what I see as a desirable physically for girls, as I am too afraid of breaking the skinny ones. *waits for usual set of crude expressions from gallery*

I'll prolly continue on my rants later today. With any luck, I'll work my way into many short updates, instead of the LONG winded ones I usually attempt for, and fail miserable with my short attention. . . Something Shiny! YAY! *wanders off*"

"event","So last night, I am sitting at home, comfy at my desk, playing my games. I hear my roomie pull up, and head into the house. He has been sparsely at home for about a week, and since we work on different schedules, we dont have much time to chat and hang out.

That, and as most of you (the people who read my journal) know, I am an extreme geek. Dont get me wrong, they let me out into society on occassion, and Alana has been harassing me to get out more, but I am fairly content in enjoying my geeky habits. Oops... this entrys is not about me... must keep focused. 

He comes in, walks down the hall, says ""Heya roomie. Sup?"" (exchange usual male greetings), and we kinda chatting about the usual small talk. Mind you, I am sitting at my desk, in my room, in my boxers and a shirt (no worries, my desk and the angle of the room make sure he does not see anything guy friends dont want to see on each other), and having this conversation.

Turns out his ex-girlfriend, the girl that he loves very dearly let him know that she has started kinda-sorta-maybe seeing someone else, but she ""does not love him""

I mean, anyone who knows my roomie knows that while he is not the type to let that side of things show. Far be it from me to start ranting about his life in my rant space, but this is something that bothers me.

The reason we seek any companionship outside of casual friendship (or random encounters of the adult nature) is to see how compatible we are with the other person. Read: We date to see if we can stand being around the other person for extended periods of time.

The scary part about My roomie and his ex-gf is that they are completely stupid and perfect for each other. Her family does not approve of him; her best friend does not like him; there are plenty of things going against them. However, if any of you saw how cute they can be together, or have seen what I have seen, it would be blatantly obvious (and I usually miss the obvious).

So now, if she does still love him, and truly wants to get back with him (which she says she does), what the hell would possess her to think that 'dating' someone else is even remotely a good idea? Maybe my limited knowledge of long term relationships have stunted me into thinking that if you want something that is important to you, you go for it. 

Transitioning this a bit about me. I recently (the past 6 months) came to the conclusion that it is best for me to do what I think and feel when it comes to my friends and involvements, and fuck what other people think. 

I guess I just dont like seeing those I care about getting screwed by people they care about, and I hate that some people make such callous decisions and then justify it with such a stupid excuse.

That's all the ranting from this kitty for now. <lj user=hellsdove> wants me to post about this past Friday night and it's randomness, and I'll do that once I remember. Yeah, like you have not heard THAT one from me before."

"event","So I head out tonight to go hang out with Stoph and Alana. Head over there and hang out with them for a bit, and then head off to grab some food. A few things I feel the need to rant about. 

I get over to Stoph's, and as usual, Alana is in pain. Dont get me wrong, I love the girl to death, and I feel bad for the amount of pain she is in from her multiple car accidents, but she really needs to get a new physical therapist, constantly be on drugs, or get into an environment where she can be taken care of. I mean, a 19 year old girl living in a house full of mid-20's boys? Notsogood for the girl.

Ranting right along, I get there, Alana is in pain, and Stoph is hiding out in his room, and Ethan is showing some girl around that is damn near identical to his girlfriend. Same face, same inflections, same body language, and (as Stoph pointed out to me) the same lack of a defined ass. Good thing she was indeed Jamie's little sister, but the rant about why people get confused, almost offended when you mention they look alike? I have almost accepted that my sibling and I look alike in many ways, and we _do_ look like if we are all set next to each other.

More ranting on its way, as I always do .

Trying to harass them to hurry up, one of them mentions that Chris was supposed to be  stopping by to see Ethan. Normally not a problem as there will be someone there, cept Ethan had just taken off to do who knows what with, you guessed it, his GF and her sister. What kind of silly person invites a friend over, then takes off to do something else? 

And now for my actual rant. 

We head out to Shari's. We grab something to eat, and meet up with the friend that Ethan had forgot about. I am paying the bill, and our waitress is at the register is helping me at the register. She looks down, and see a small cut on her hand. Grabs a close napkin, realizes that is not going to be quite enough, and looks up at me to ask:

""Do you mind waiting for a moment while I go grab a band-aid?""

And I am shocked. I am incredulous. I am amazed that she did not know that ""Band-aid"" is a trademarked term! =O

Ok. Seriously. I was shocked. The way she looked at me and paused, then waited for me to give her permission. I could not believe that she waited until she had confirmation from me. And there is me, looking at her, waiting for my approval for about 3 seconds before I manage to get over the shock and spout out:

""Please do. No need to ask my permission.""

So she heads in the back room to get a band-aid, and comes back out and apologizes. Now I can see her doing the usual customer service apology ""Sorry for the wait"" but she apologized for the cut.

And while she is getting the pie for us to go and ringing us up, I look at her and say, with a big grin on my face:

""What would you have done if I had said no?""

It was actually kinda cute to see someone else get flustered like I do when I am trying to think of a response.

So there are my main rants. Comments anyone?


Oh. another note, we watched Shaolin Soccer tonight. Good Cheesy comedy. I suggest you all watch it. 

Till next time, toodles!"

I guess I can easily see jaguar_lady (and yes I dont know how to link that *cries*) fitting most of them (Feet licked, Candlewax on Nipples, Tied up, Leather and Lace), and am debating if she will be more surprised that I updated, or that I can see all four of those at once. *ducks*

I know JD has a New Kids Fetish, but that is one of those leftover things from when we were growing up. I still love ya bro. I just hope to GAWD I never find out if sister Jessica holds true to these. *twitch*"

So I am really bad at updating. Horrible. In fact, I think I shall change my name to Forgetful McUpdatePants. I am not even going to try to promise to update, but I am going to promise to try.

Just to show the people how much of an anime geek I am (and strangely, the people who would A| read this, and B| get this, meet nowhere in between), a random-ism:

Aside from this, um... comment! Maybe I shall be inspired if I have people commenting for me to update. Then I shall take the time to share all the twisted recent events in my life. :D"

"event","ok. So I know I promised all of you that I would update more frequently. And for those of you who know me well, I am a _REALLY_ bad liar :D I think I will take this entry to add some updates on my very recent life.

A few nights ago, I am at a local Japanese food place having dinner with Bastard (co-worker of mine named Adam, who is well.... a real bastard, but a comical one), and showing him the joys of Sushi and Sake. For the record, this is a place in town called Shiki that has a lightly seared Abacore Sashimi that is to die for! I mean, it is so good, it really does melt in your mouth! 

Anycase... After 2 large bottles of Sake, much protein, and some studying for the CISSP (him and I are signed up for the test at the same time at the end of this month), my Second Wife, Jessica C. calls (OK. This one I will have to explain in another entry, but just accept this as a fact for now. There will be a handy sheet at the end of this entry to explain who everyone is), and wants me to meet up with some people for drinks. Bastard and I finish up, and I sober up enough to drive (lecture me later people!), and head down to meet up with her at a mutual friend's house. As I am driving down there, I realize that she said her best friend Jessica (trust me, I get confused on this too, as there are about 5 of them in my life right now, not including my sister) would only join if I was to be there. 

Jessica S. (JC's best friend) is a hottie. No really. For those of you who understand some of my upbringing, she is a Half-Japanese, Half-Scottish girl who was raised Catholic. And she is a true redhead. So do the math.... Redheaded Japanese Catholic Schoolgirl... She is the only one that can call me Marky Mark, and not have me drop into asshole mode.

Moving on. We meet up, head over to the Blarney Stone (Irish Bar), and grab some drinks. Play some pool, sing some songs with the jukebox, demonstrate that despite how my voice sounds, I have a full vocal range. 

How many guys do you know that can still hit the high note in A-HA's ""Take on me"" as well as the low range in Butthole Surfers ""Pepper""?

When they closed up, we headed over to The Highlands (Pool Hall/Bar), and continued on the events for the eve. After letting Cody beat me at 2 games of pool (intentional scratch on the 8, as he was SUCKING! and then sunk the 8 as I had to deal with drama.), I had to pry this little angry-drunk hottie (JS) off some people that she was attempting to beat senseless. 

For those of you who read <a href=http://www.somethingpositive.net>Something Positive</a>, JS reminds me quite a bit of PeeJee. 

Take her home, carry her from my Pathfinder to her apartment, make light conversation while I am carrying her:

JS: You smell nice!
Me: Thank you, I try.
JS: No, I mean you really smell nice!!
Me: I pride myself on such things.
JS: No, You _really_ smell nice!!!
(till we get to her door...)

Pour her into bed, tuck her in, and send a text message to JC letting her know that JS was home ok, only to have my Jacket beep at me... Pause... Send another message to JC's phone... Jacket beeps... Send a message that says ""Crap! Your phone is in my Jacket!"" and fly back across town to get there before the bar closes. I do make it there (barely), and then bail out of there to avoid the odd people who are trying to sell tatoos outside the bar. 

Whew! That covers one night, without too much background. I cannot wait until I have more time to update this, and can give the full backstory, as well as explain how I ended up with 2 wives, a harem, a concubine, a mistress, and then the girl I am currently seeing.

As promised, the handy-dandy chart of people currently:

Social Companions:
Shiloh (Shi) == First Wife, Best friend.
Jessica C. (JC) == Second Wife, Best friend.
Stopher (Stoph) == Best male friend, and old roommate for many years. Fellow Otaku.
Anna == The Mistress. Hey! She chose that title, as opposed to ""The woman in another state""
Nauzley (Naz) == Close friend, and another cutie.
Jessica S. (JS) == JC's Best friend, and a (true) redheaded japanese girl.
Liz == Lady-friend (claims to be a true redhead) who will kill me when she reads this line!
Stephanie == Good friend who loves the goth-life.
Nate == Not even gonna try to explain him.
Jessica B. (JB) == Yet another Jessica! Best bud to Naz.
Becky == Former co-worker who I still kick it with. 

Co-workers that I kick it with:
Adam (Bastard) == Co-worker who is taking the CISSP with me. Truly a bastard.
Tim (Bossman) == Boss, and Sushi lover. Encrypted Messenger is a godsend!

Family - 
Papa-san == Old school geek. Loved by all my friends.
Mammi-Cheese == People pulling people out of people (are the strangest people).
Jessica H. (JH) == Older Sister. 1/6. We have frequent conversations in yoda-speak.
Brother (JD) == Older (only) Brother. 2/6. FURP!
Deirdre (Dee) == Younger Sister. 4/6. Lives in town. Has a stinky boyfriend.
Colleen (Neen) == Younger Sister. 5/6. Lives where Davan will never find a girlfriend ;)
Bethany (Beebers) == Baby Sister. 6/6. 14yrs old. I will be there to protect her from boys!

This will be more complete in the future ;) If I forgot you, and you are planning to hunt me down to hurt me for it, lemme know beforehand. I have to plan my abuse so my calendar does not get to full. Or, you could post, and let me know. :D

More updates Later!

"event","So for those of you who actually check this on occasion, I swear I will be updating this. 

All those who have heard this from me before, post a reply with ""AYE!""

There is much that has occurred since I last posted, and much to tell. Some of it will have to be posted in small doses, as I don't think anyone's sanity can take a whole lot of my life all at once. (Just imagine how I have been dealing with it all!)

So for those people who really want to know right now what I have been up to, I _promise_ I will tell, just very slowly...

"event","So here I am having a party at mi casa. Have a fair amount of the people I call friend over, but am feeling a bit down.

Perhaps it is the amount of alcohol in my system, but there is something nagging at me that I cannot place. Let us go over the things that are important to me.

Family:
No matter what, my family is going to be across the country, or far away from me. When my parents and sisters moved away, I was a little depressed, but the full gravity of the situation didn't hit me until the holidays rolled around. I know, I know. The depression is just seasonal, but there are times when it is nice to have the family around that drive you nuts 23 hours out of the day. Thoughts of finding a job out there, and moving to spend time with them does come up, but then I wonder what is the reason I would really do that. 
Security? Having something to fall back on? 
Nah. When I was out of work for the few months I was, I was still able to stand on my own 2 feet. I guess I just miss having them around to visit with when I feel the need. So selfish of me ;) This being nothing new, I discard that idea.

Friends:
I have a few people I truly trust. Those that I confide everything in are few and far between. So I have a select few friends that I don't worry about what they think or what they can get out of me, despite my own paranoia. So it kinna be the friends I keep that are making me feel empty, as this is nothing new either.

Work:
I like my job. Granted a desk job supporting people with more money then sense has both its ups and downs. I like my co-workers, and I happen to like my boss. Hell, my boss is here chatting with my friends and co-workers, and I am not worried about what will happen come Monday morning when everyone is back into the working dynamic. Nothing new there, so back on to the mental track.

Money:
Lets face it. Everyone worries about money. How much you can afford to do on the budget you have. Always worrying about getting out of debt is a constant as well, so this is not the issue.

Relationships:
Kinna be this one either. I have accepted that until I get everything else in my life straight, then I will not worry about this one. Granted, I have 'flings' and 'involvements' but nothing has been solid in my life for this scenario ever. Scratch that idea, and I am down to nothing else that I can think of.

Any suggestions from the world out there is always needed when some mildly drunk dumbass is wondering about everything that is going on around him.

Lemme know if any of you can think of something.

"event","Back to the world of the living dead.

After spending some time in Los Angeles with the family, I am back here in Eugene. Being down there has help me to realize some things.

1. People who say they miss you, only do so to get you to visit. The likelihood of any of my friends coming up here is pertty slim.
2. Family rules! Lets face it, no one else will buy you beer just to keep you happy, and to make sure you have something to drink that no one else will. Also, they have the best couches to crash on. 
3. The car that should have died years ago will only do so when you have a craving for Jamba Juice. And no matter how hard you try to remember that you left the CDs open in the front seat, you will curse and swear when it hits you 5 minutes from being dropped off.
4. You _WILL_ run into someone you never expect at Starbucks. I was worried about running into some ex-girlfriends who would love to serve me as Rocky Mountain Oysters, and I run into some random girls from Junior High of all places, who recognized me!. Makes you wonder how much you really change from those days before puberty.
5. PCAnywhere and VPN's do not mix.
6. Never buy AMF's for your friends, even if they are 21, and dont have their ID. You will regret having to listen to the drunken ramblings, becuase no one likes an annoying drunk.
7. No matter how many times you tell the annoying drunk it is nothing personal, they will not believe you. BTW, if you are reading this, IT IS NOTHING PERSONAL! I just have no tolerance for annoying drunken idiots.

As for what I learned since I have been back up here:

1. People do drive less that 75MPH on the I5 in Oregon.
2. No one has any information on a Synoptics Lattisnet 3030. I came across one, and I cannot find any bloody info on it. Anyone with info on it or the modules, please let me know.
3. Not everyone celebrates thanksgiving. I had always thought it was a pretty neutral holiday, but there is some religious connotation to it.
4. No matter if you are gone or not, people assume you are still at work.
5. PCAnywhere and VPN's do not mix.
6. Not everyone is rooting for you to get promoted.
7. The quiet life is a lot easier then the high-paced life.

Since I got back, I have been more or less working non-stop (with some quick breaks for Capcom vs. SNK 2 with the old roomates), and my obsessive work habits have paid off. I just got a promotion, and start training for it on Dec. 3rd (yay me!). My gems of wisdom will have to wait until another time, as I have to run to class. 

As for the quote from the Great John Huntley (Sr.), it will have to wait until my fractured memory returns, so there may be a quote randomly from my memory at an odd hour. The world will have to wait...

Oh yeah. This Autobot test is quite acurate, and everone should take it, if only to find out which bot you could have been in a past life.

If I was an Autobot, I'd be:<br>

"event","So I just move into this neighborhood a few months ago, and already I have found out a few odd things.

1. People in this neighborhood are newspaper thieves. I know that sounds petty and stupid, but when you wake up Sunday morning, and want the full-color funny papers, you get grumpy when you realize that is all that has been gaffolded. 

2. There is a halloween mob in this area. Seriously, my roomate Brad gets home, and finds this halloween chain letter on the door. Goes a little something like this:
""You have received this treat courtesy of the Halloween Ghost.
If your family doesn't want to be 
~HAUNTED~
this Halloween, you'd better follow these instructions!
1. Make 2 copies of this paper an 2 copies of the ""Boo! Got You"" Ghost.
2. Hang <u>your</u> copy of the ghost on your front door. (That way, everyone will know that you've been ""treated"")
3. Make a treat for 2 of your neighbors, and deliver them by 10:00 tomorrow night along with a copy of these instructions and a copy of the ""Boo! got you"" Ghost. Don't take your treats to someone who already has received a treat.
4. Have a good time!""

Does this sound a little like mob insurance to anyone else?

""Youz best give other peoplez some candiez, or youz gonna be haunted!""

Figured the peeps out there can give me some insight on if my house is gonna get egged on halloween..."

"event","Another monday has progressed, and yet I am no closer to my desire to be ruler of the world than I was at 4:30 this morning. After recently rediscovering the joy of caffeine, as found in those cherry mountain dew cans, my productivity has skyrocketed. And yet I wonder... Will any user truly realize the message of hate and discontent I was attempting to convey to them? Like most people, I have a deep love for all things living. However, I qualify people who are unable to read manuals, assume to much, or cannot distinguish that workstation (or professional) is not equal to server, as the type of people that intentionally look for typos in newspaper ads or online so they can piss and moan about how they deserve to be treated better. In essence, these people are know only as.... Consumers.
Don't get me wrong. I still have that love for all people, but these consumers need to go the way of the lemmings. On as side note, my ""call of the ocean"" machine is still in beta testing. It will be released shortly after I have perfected the Infinite Probability Drive, and shortly before Norton Magic Wand is released.

On to another topic. I will periodically be noting great scenarios, memorable quotes, or overall thoughts about my family. This edition, I think I will start off with a quote from the Great John Huntley (Sr.):
""Shit Howdy!"" (or) ""Howdy Shit!"" 
(for those of you not familiar with the work of John Huntley, please contact you local Huntley office, via email, phone, or whistle REAL loud using only your tongue)

And as for my brother, I need to see him, and drink a beer with him. Since I have recently become the legal drinking age, I now need to find some way to visit my brother. I hardly ever have a chance to talk to him, being as when I am not saving the world from hackers, I patrol the streets of Eugene, fighting crime. 

You should see how difficult is is to find an arch villain around here! The worst crime I have encountered since donning the flannel shirt and prowling the streets as the Ponytailed Slacker, is people taking bong hits, and not offering it to every person who passes by.

Back to my brother, we used to be real close when we lived in the same room. So often I would be taking a piss over the toilet, and he'd walk up next to me and whip it out to piss too. People have no idea how much of a bonding experience it is when 2 brothers piss beside each other. I miss him. I miss my sister too, but I get a chance to talk to her on a regular basis, and we can update each other on the true meaning of Luke and Lorelei.

When all is said and done at the end of the day, I think you will all agree with me, that kicking back with a Black Butte Porter (some DAMN fine beer for those of you who like microbrews) and relaxing to 08th MS team makes the stress of the day just melt away.

P.S. The term Dendrifiliac is the term associated with those who enjoy sticking it in a shrubbery."

"event","Teaching class again today. I love the look on people's face when they are called upon to answer questions that they know they should know. It is very akin to the deer in headlights. Sure, you may call me a sadist for it, but it helps the class to learn more. 
I spent the first 3 hours of a 4 hour class descriping how to split subnets, and mind you splitting subnets is very similar to having a root canal without any anestetic, except more painful. I was able to wrap up everything else you need to know about TCP/IP within the last hour, but I get the feeling that since the class started to chant in binary, I should have gone into a little less detail about occult learning styles with computers.
Gotta run kids, but may post again after the Feminist Religion for Early Aztec class I get to teach. 

P.S. the act of fornication with shrubbery was a common practice in early Scotland. Only when they discovered that sheep could be used for sweaters did they establish a new hobby."

"event","After teaching a class for tapdancing to leemurs, you would think that the day could not get any better. I mean, those cute little rats have the same appeal as lemmings, and the same desire to drop off a cliff. It's a good thing I live in Eugene, Oregon, were the worst we have to worry about is the smell of hippie on the downtown mall.
My Bro JD is out of his mind. Don't get me wrong, I love him to death, but he is one of the few people that can make me think twice about trying to convert the loyal Windows users to Linux. <rant> In thinking about it, most AOL users cannot click on the start button, so the idea of giving them root privledges makes me want to hide under the cartoon appeal of Windows XP. </rant>
Enough of my geekiness for today. I'll head off to my CCNA class, and hope that tonight when I go home, I don't have the OSI model oozing out my ears. 
I'll update this on a regular basis, but am looking forward to a few days not being around computers. Can we say house party? What happens when the roomates go out of town? You guessed it. 
Good Beer, BBQ, and non-stop music. If anyone happens to be passing through Oregon, you can spot my house by the police choppers overhead telling us to turn it the fuck down. See ya there.

P.S. Go Fuck A Tree."

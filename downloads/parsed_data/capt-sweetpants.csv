brother (Jake) and we are living together for the summer semester...at
least until I go to boot camp in July. I am going to be an officer and
I have been accepted into the counter-intelligence program Arabic
speaking!!! I am very excited to be in this program. I have always been
patriotic and had the desire to serve my country and now I will be able
to do so in the best way. It has been a year since my last
entry...oops! But all that happened was I went through a couple
gir;friends, found a great one and passed all my classes while joining
the military. I am still alive and kikin'!!!</span>"

"event","<P><FONT size=4>Well, I am not in search of any kind of ""sole companion"" but they sure seem to be hunting for me. I don't know why and perhaps I shouldn't say but...the last few nights I have slept(only slept) with different girls. Now normally this would be considered male slut behavior but I was not looking for it to happen; it just did. Unfortunately though the complexity of these particular intimate moments has now come back to haunt me. Each girl expressed interest in continuing a serious relationship and in some cases a sexual one. I didn't anticipate this and so now I have ""a whole lotta shit"" to deal with and it's my own fault. I am not a 'man-whore', I just like sleeping next to beautiful women; and when there are an abundance of them that wouldn't mind a big tall sleeping buddy...well...I just don't say no. -Should I? Yeah, I guess I should; but then I have to decide if the situation presented itself again would I? I am forced to answer yes. Oh well, I am not fit to be loved anyway. so I may as well enjoy this while it lasts. Live it up and all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rock On!</FONT></P>"

You have it all! You're strong, popular, and you even have the love of you life! People look up to the person you are now, but that doesn't change the fact that you were probably liable of doing a lot of bad things in the past. You have a strong sense of morals and justice. You're the perfect leader--with a dark past!"

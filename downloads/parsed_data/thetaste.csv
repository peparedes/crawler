"event","I've been reading several interesting articles about the current run up in the price of oil. One can begin with 3 major theories about why this is so. 

1) The price is artificially high due to speculators.

2) The price is artificially high due to government intervention.

3) There isn't enough oil to go around. 

   One of the most interesting theories is that he US government, through private business channels is driving up the price of oil in order to tax the world. The logic is this. All oil transactions are done in dollars. So if China buys oil from Iran they pay in dollars not in Iranian rial or Chinese yuan. The major economies can only afford to get dollars by selling stuff at American Walmarts and Toyota dealerships.

   Once the oil producing countries get their hands on the dollars, what are they to do with them? Well they buy American assests, such as Treasury bonds, home mortgages, and stocks. They take these American assests and print their local currency based on how much the dollar value is. For example if they have 1 dollar in assests they can print 2 of their own currency and spend it into the economy.

   So it goes the higher the price of oil the bigger the US federal budget deficit can be. 

Interesting theory."

Thats really weird when you think about it. The concept of knowing how to do something without knowing the nature of what it is your doing raises all sorts of metaphysical questions. And shouldn't there be a comma somewhere in that last sentence? 

One of the wonderful side effects of learning english, apart from punctuation paranoia, is that my japanese is getting alot better. I am sure that it is due to finally having something in my experience to relate japanese to."

"event","Because circumstances kinda require it I am attempting to learn japanese. One of the many aspects of japanese that blows my mind is the many personal pronouns. For example in english we have I. In japanese there are 4 or 5 references to self. From what I gather they mean the following.

Watashi- Standard polite
Watkushi- Very polite
Boku- Just letting you know I am a guy
Ore- Vular reference to self, I don't I've heard women use this.
Sessha- When your pretending your a samurai

My mind reels at the concept. Sure I can mechanically understand this concept of multiple personal pronouns, but I certainly don't understand the why."

Moore follows a woman named Lila who encouraged her son to go into the army and supported the Iraq war. When her son is killed she is angry with Bush and changes her mind about the war. Moore doesn't take to her to task about her views causing her sons death. 

The final premise is that we were all duped by Bush about the war. The problem with that argument is, of course, that no one was duped. Moore is giving those people who got caught up in ""war fever"" an easy way out. The type of people Moore is giving the pass to is the same type of people that supported Hitler's invasion of Poland. Moore's propaganda piece will only serve to reprogram not reform. 

One of my favorite scene's was an old iraqi woman crying out to god to punish the americans. It seems its the only thing left for her. No earthly institution will give her justice."

The tomato's we planted outside of that poopy zone immediately began to die. I might as well have planted them in beach sand. I was shocked at how unfertile the land was. I kinda wanted to avoid store fertilizers just because I thought it would be challenging and I see them as the problem to and not the solution to farming. So yesterday I was off to the horse poopy pile, which my friends so graciously allow me to take at will. 

I also admit to busting out the Miracle Grow and thus perpetuating the problem. Maybe I should have just gotten disgusted and let the land remain fallow like it really needs.

... our current system of world government involves giving the leaders of all the major countries access to buttons that can launch missiles and vaporize unsuspecting citizens. I think a better system would be if every world leader had to walk around with a sack of explosives on his back and every citizen had access to a wristwatch button that would detonate it. My concept has many benefits beyond the obvious entertainment factor and the reduced risk of being vaporized by an incoming missile. For one thing, there would no longer be any such thing as a ""slow news day"". And the boring pack of lies called the State of the Union speech would last about thirty seconds. I have to think taxes would be abolished altogether. We wouldn't need all the tax money anyway: The military would be unnecessary and the economic stimulus from eliminating taxes would make all the poor people incredibly wealthy, or so I've been told. And if we needed a highway or dam built, we could give our president a trowel and then place one finger menacingly over the wristwatch button and say, ""Start working, Goober."" I realize that my concept would degrade the prestige of the presidency, but I don't think that prestige was doing me any good anyway."

Sidenote:
Wort is what you get when you mix hot water with malted barley and extract all the sugary goodness. It is brown and very sticky and sweet.

Anyway:
After boiling the wort with the hops I had used my new wort chiller. So I brought the wort temp down to like a 100 and then mixed it with water right out of the tap to top it off at 5 gallons. So I think the bacteria came in with tap water that wasn't sterilized. So I figure if I sterilize the water I will mix with the wort, I should be ok.

"event","Once upon a time in a land far away there was a quaint little village. The village had a few shops and several farmers lived there also. The farmers grew mostly wheat, but some grew vegatables too. 
    One day the farmers got together and decided to make their life easier. They build one big silo in town together to put all their wheat in. In order to keep track of how much each farmer put in they would each get one ticket stub for each bushel of wheat they put in. Everyone in town thought it was such a good idea that they agreed to accept the tickets instead of a bushel of wheat. The farmers could then buy whatever they wanted in town with these tickets instead of bartering. 
    The farmers decided to call having lots of tickets instead of wheat, liquidity. Because they could easily get what they wanted and the tickets just sorta a flowed around town. 
    For a time the little town prospered because it was easier to buy and sell things.  But one year it was bad, because there was such a good harvest that all the farmers had lots and lots of tickets. This meant that the prices of goods in the town went up so that the merchants could get more of those tickets. But some people didn't get more tickets that year and couldn't buy enough of that they needed.
    Then one year there was a drought so the farmers didn't have very many tickets. They were getting by but then one very rich farmer cashed in most of his tickets to get his wheat out. He wanted to trade it out of town for a new tractor. Then tickets were really hard to find so that you could buy things. And the people that did have them didn't want to get rid of them because they thought they wouldn't be able to get anymore. 
     One day a stranger called Federal Reserve came to town. And while he was sitting at the local saloon he was hearing about the problems that the townspeople were having with their ticket system. He suddenly came up with a great idea and he told it to the townspeople.
     He said you should put me in charge of the ticket system. First we shouldn't be on the wheat standard anymore. Because any change in the amount of wheat we grow or have has such a big affect on the number of tickets in the town. Instead the silo will pay the farmer tickets for each bushel based on how much wheat the baker needs.
     I will also loan tickets out to people that need it. When there a only a few tickets in town loans will be very easy to get. When there are many tickets in town it will be very hard to get a loan.
     Everyone thought this would be a great way to solve all their problems and agreed to give Mr. Reserve control over their tickets. But one little boy who was listening spoke up and said, ""Mr. Reserve, where will you get the tickets to lend us?""
""Why my boy"", said Mr. Reserve patting the boy on the head, ""I'll just print them of course."""

For example, last night I was alarmed to find an extremely bright star in the sky. After entering in some info into a website I was able to determine it was simply Venus. Albeit it was stilling alarmingly bright. I was even able to spot Mars and Saturn. Though they significantly less awesome.

Thus I am now an amateur astronomer. or am I?

I was reading and discussing economics this week. Mostly it stemmed from a discussion of the housing market bubble. Then I looked more into it and found it was a debt market bubble. Current debt to GDP ratios for this country are running at 300%. What this means is that to grow the economy 1% we need to increase our debt as a nation by 4.4%. In the household arena and corporate arena that is happening at a rate of between 8-9% for every 1% increase in income. 

Continuing at this rate we will eventually consume all the credit there is to be had because we are consuming credit faster than we can save. Currently alot of the domestic credit is being comsumed and a good portion of our credit is coming from overseas. Infact 42% of the federal debt is now being funded from abroad. 

Here is a example of the problem that will eventually be faced by americans.

Joe American makes $10,000 dollars a month. He spends $5,000 month on whatever he wants and $5,000 on mortgage and credit card payments. If Joe's income declines by 10% his buying power decreases by 20%. If his debt costs go up it pushes out his ability to spend at a proportional rate. For every $1 more he makes a month he will increase his debt by $8 thus making the situation even worse. 

There is now no way for Joe to get out of debt without disaster. If Joe and all other Americans decide to stop accumulating debt the economy will go into recession because its growth is dependent on Joe spending more than he earns. This will reduce his income and will start a vicious downward spiral of decreasing income and decreasing economic growth until the proper level is reestablished. 

If he continues on he will run out of credit and be forced to stop buying more than he earns also. 

In short it is just now a waiting game until the fire that is the American economy consumes all the avaliable credit and burns itself out.

What does this have to do with astronomy? When a star begins to consume more energy than it produces the clock is ticking toward Nova. If a star is big enough, then Supernova and blackhole. 

America is that star and our energy is wealth. We have made the flip a long time ago to consumers of it and not creators of it. And yes we are big enough for SuperNova and Blackhole status. We are likely to drag every industrialized and developing country into the abyss with us. 

We can't read the clock, but we can hear it ticking."

n. the use of force, false imprisonment or threats (and possibly psychological torture or ""brainwashing"") to compel someone to act contrary to his/her wishes or interests. If duress is used to get someone to sign an agreement or execute a will, a court may find the document null and void. A defendant in a criminal prosecution may raise the defense that others used duress to force him/her to take part in an alleged crime. 

So I says to the judge, I says... You can't hold me resposible for not filing taxes last year, because if I did it would have been under duress and thus making my 1040 null and void. But since I didn't file your threat of force has been actualized and I have been arrested and restrained and taken to this court room. Again I am under duress.

So the judge says.... One more outburst like that and I will find you in contempt of court and throw you in jail.

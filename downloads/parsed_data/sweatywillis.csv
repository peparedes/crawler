"event","This weekend sucked.

I spent the whole afternoon Friday puking my brains out, among other things.  The dehydration and in ability to hold down water forced me to spend the night in St. Luke's hospital getting meds and 5 liters of IV fluid pumped into me.

When I returned to school, I was swamped with work.

Monday - write two lab reports for Physics
         study for Sociology
         study for German
         worry about Botany and Physics exams on Wednesday
Tuesday - finish and hand in lab reports
          do at least most of my Physics homework
          study for Botany
          study for Physics

This weekend sucked."

"event","I LOST MY DAMN DEBIT CARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was all the way out in frickin' Whitehall and in line to pay when I realized that it was gone.  So I had to look for it, and when I realized I couldn't find it, I had to go to the bank to cancel it.  Dammit!  I fell asleep in botany, too.  Damn.  And dinner sucked horribly.  At least I hit a double eagle in Tiger Woods.  Take that you bastard.

Oh, and some poor bastard on campus got sued by the music industry for $3000 for downloading music.  The music industry sucks so freakin' much!  They have enough freakin' money; you'd think that all those pop stars who sold their souls for #1 hits would rake it, but apparently not.  That's why I almost never buy music."

"event","All in all, not a bad weekend.  Friday through Saturday was fun, although Friday was the only truly productive night.  

Friday was Casino Night.  Verdict: Bring it back; the only thing from IMPACT that doesn't suck other than the comedian.  Also wrote a sweet review on RotK with Ian and a good article on the weight room (surprise, surprise).  No money was involved in Casino Night, but we could trade in dollar amounts of chips for raffle tickets.  I managed to win a DVD of ""Old School"" and a VHS of ""Dumb and Dumber"".  Sweeeeeeet.

Saturday was a party at Sig Ep; fun but not productive at all.

Sunday was the Super Bowl.  Great game (although the Panthers lost); decent commercials.  Ate too much and spent way too much money Saturday and Sunday.  Did some reading, however."

Today I discover a giant grease stain on one of my favorite pairs of pants; now I have to actually spend money on clothing.  I'm not big on fashion, but the grease nonetheless bothers me.  My shins are sore; I should take some Advil.  I discovered that I can make half-assed journal icons on my computer; hopefully I can get to work and do some stuff with it.  I will not, however, come close to my sister in terms of pure genius and originality when it comes to creating those little suckers.  I bow in artistic deference to her (don't get your hopes up kiddo, I'm still the big brother ;-)).  Botany lab today was too damn long again; if I actually hated the class, I could focus my problems more efficiently, but I like the class and the prof's good at teaching, so I'm torn.  Meh.  Fuck it.  Lab sucks no matter what.  Dammit.  Now I have a butt-load of Hausaufgaben fuer Deutsch to do.  At least I don't have to worry about trying to find a date to the Mardi Gras dance: we have a meet the next day, so being on my feet for a few hours and possibly boozing a little is out of the question as a good pre-meet workout.  Meh.  Wow, that wasn't my shins; that was my calves.  They are really tight.  Shite.  I should stretch.  And put away my laundry.  And do my German homework.  And read my frickin' botany (damn, I need to go to the library)."

"event","Everyone else in the frickin' Lehigh Valley has off or a significant delay except for us.  What are we, retarded or something?  The school is so dicked if someone gets in a bad accident or falls or something.

And the crappy part is, I didn't even sleep well last night; I kept waking up, thinking it was first thing in the morning so I could check my e-mail to find that classes were cancelled.  Damn this school!

On the plus side, however, I had a decent workout yesterday: 4 miles on a treadmill at tempo pace, but just easier than tempo effort, meaning I'm getting back into my aerobic shape of yore.

And did I mention that Moravian College is gay?  Almost as gay as the Academy.

<P>-that pinko bastard on Tough Crowd needed to shut the hell up </P>
<P>-I hope I don't have class tomorrow </P>

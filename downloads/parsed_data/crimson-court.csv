YES MAdam I think of you constantly.  

And I didn't think that you were cheating on me.  I was just surprised that you said everything was a lie even if it was a joke.  I am sorry that you took it that way.  I already knew you were in the CIA/FBI anyways you crazy beanpod."

Well last night Danelle slept over because I pretty much begged her to, even though she had a lot of work to do.  As we were sleeping my drunk roomate and his girlfriend were sleeping and they decided why not get fiesty right in front of us.  Danelle woke up to roomy railing his girlfriend completely naked and exposed.  Then I woke up and almost threw up because of what happened.  So at four in the morning when they had finished we applauded them for there good show and how grateful we were for it and decided to sleep in Danelle's room.  This is why Umaine is not that enjoyable.  This kind of shit happens all of the time.  O well at least I dont have to worry about walking in on them if they feel comftorable just fucking right in front of me. yayaya

I am sitting around for a little while until the hockey game tonight.  Maine vs. Merrimack.  After that I will prob hang out with Danelle for a little while and then go to bed.  I am pretty excited that the semester is almost over.  I just want to get these credits under my belt so I don't have to worry as much.  I know it sounds dumb but that is just how I am (NERD).  I ate some really delicious crackers a little while ago.

That kind of sucked and I am pretty sure it was the douchebags that live next to me that did it.  I went to the campus police and filed a report with Danelle and then the officer went to their room.  I don't know what happened because I was going to Bangor with the girly.  I also would like to one little thing to Danelle-------MAXIM--------------     OYa.  Shast is nice.  I am not going to get into detail about that, and trust me when I say you don't want me to.  I have to go to class now and play with my nostrils to keep myself entertained.         I love Pea.

Then I get in a fight with one of my best friends which really sucked, but we will def work shast out.  Then I went to bed but I couldn't fall asleep until 4 oclock in the morning.  I then woke up with puffs under my eyes and went to physics recitation which I did not understand a word of, and I have a test on it tommorow which really sucks donkey balls.  Then I went to Computer Design and fucked up every possible thing that I could so I had to stay a half hour longer than everyone else.  (two more classes and I finish that fucking course).  Now I am cooling off and about to go to lunch with Danelle.  I am listening to The Who Ultimate Collection that I got from Evan, it fucking rocks.  I love The Who.     I WANT BAND PRACTICE NOW!!!!!!!!!!

  I went to my Prof. today to ask him about the homework and then halfway through he stops and says o shast (not his exact words, but you get the point) and realizes that he gave us a problem a lot harder than he wanted to, but then figured he would make us do it anyways.  I love when he does that, I get so fucking excited!
  I got a lot of sleep last night which was awesome and I think a few more nights like that and I will be feeling real good again soon.

I can for the most part, but I can't do any contact sports or work out, not that I do that anyways, but I feel very limited.  A few weeks and I am finished for the semester, I just don't want to get lazy quite yet (though I feel the slackage coming on). 

   I have to think about buying christmas presents for people soon. I don't really know what to get anyone so if you have random ideas feel free to throw them at me so I can get the ball rolling.  I think I am going to go to bed so I can relax for a bit. Yarggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg.

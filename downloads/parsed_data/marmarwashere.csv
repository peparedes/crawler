"event","so its been kinda wierd lately. i got a job. im teaching private lessons. have the house alone with my brother for a week. everything seems like its going so good for me. but underneath it all theres like this sadness. but its mixed sort of with happiness. you see, im not the same girl i was last year, even at the beginning of the summer. ive met so many great people. im so different and i think i want things to be this way. the problem is, im having a really hard time letting go. im not really a clingy person but this summer i went through a breakup and i lost my three best friends. we just didnt fit as well. but i cant help to think how sad it makes me when they have sleepovers without me, without even thinking of inviting me. weeks where nobody calls. i feel like part of me has been taken away with them. it just hurts really bad. but i think going through something like this is going to help me grow into the woman i want to be, the woman i will be for the rest of my life. but i just cant let go. its so hard. theyve been my sisters. they know me inside and out. they would do anything for me and me to them. but its all different now. times have changed. but if growing up is gonna hurt this much, im not sure i ever want to. but i have to, i know. and ill make it. i, along with eveyone else, will have to make this journey alone, doing whats best for me and what i love."

Ive been inspired to learn the accordian, so tomorrow, if Im not on the computer, that is why. yes that is correct, I will be practicing my accordian. I love the nerdyness of that.

"event","So this is my first livejournal entry. After deleting my myspace, yes i finally did it, i felt like i still needed to have connections to the internet world. hahaha. so this is my way to ""connect."" tee hee.
So yes, i was just up north for the weekend and i was able to see my triplet cousins and their brother, who i only see once a year, so it proved to be quite exciting. except, being a red head totally sucks. no joke either. so i put on sunscreen 3 times today, spf 50 too, and i still come out looking like a lobster, and it hurts to wear clothes. yippie for me. but the weekend was fun. i went tubing a lot, and rachel, my cousin, and i finally mastered the ""lets switch tubes during the ride thing."" and suprising enough, seeing as i have been going up north to my grandparents cottage since i was born, i took my first ever jet ski ride yesterday. and my little cousin drove me, becuase its not legal for me to drive a boat like operating vehicle, a funny thing, yes. and on friday i went to a jazz thing at rotary where i saw mike and his friend alex (i think, im horrible with names) and inbal. woo hoo. it was a pretty fun night, but i wish they would have played some different types of jazz, if you know what i mean, like not all smooth jazz. well thats okay though, cause we had fun and thats all that matters i guess. Well, thats enough to be said for one night i guess.

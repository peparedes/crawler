"event","<b>Age:</b> 19
<b>Height:</b> 5'7""(-ish)
<b>Weight:</b> 125(-ish)
<b>Medical Info:</b> Your average, healthy teenager, with all the childhood immunizations of her home planet. She's taken a bullet before and still has a scar from that. Otherwise, nothing for you docs to worry about. 
<b>Eyes:</b> Green
<b>Hair:</b> Light brown
<b>Physical traits:</b> Kaylee is well-built and shows signs of being quite active. Her wardrobe varies from her earth-toned work clothes to her brighter on-planet clothes. She likes to mess with her hair. Most of the time, though, it will be free-hanging or pulled into a no-nonsense pigtail. She keeps herself fairly clean, but don't be surprised if she gets a bit of grime on you while shaking your hand. 
<b>What's Okay To Mention Around Him/Her:</b> Most anything's kosher. Try to keep breaking the fourth wall around her if you can, but she'll probably have a hard time believing you if you do. 
<b>Abilities:</b> She's got a knack for almost anything mechanical. What does this mean? She can fix pretty much any machine, create machinery from spare parts, and deconstruct a fellow mechanic's workings.
<b>Notes for the Psychics:</b> No really dark secrets here, so probing about in Kalyee's brainmeats will be just about as efficient as talking with her. 
<b>Can I shapeshift/bodyswap/spit at/step on/etc?:</b> Asking would be cool for the shapeshifting or bodyswapping, but odds are I'll be game. Anything else? When in doubt, ask, but I can roll with most things. 
<b>Maim/Murder/Death:</b> D= Please to not be killing Kaylee. It will likely not lead to fun situations. 
<b>Cooking:</b> Kaylee loves her food and can handle herself pretty well in a kitchen. But, she'll probably be leaving to cooking to the cooks."

<b>Age:</b> 20
<b>Character:</b> Kaywinnit Lee ""Kaylee"" Frye
<b>Series:</b> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29"">Firefly</a>
<b>Character Age:</b> 19
<b>Canon:</b> <small>Firefly is, essentially, the story of nine people on a spaceship. There's no definite direction where they're going as long as there's money at the end and a bit of fighting on the way. The cast is wide and varied, from your general sort of respectable thieves and thugs to preachers with sketchy backgrounds and doctors with slightly less than sane sisters. The series mostly focuses on the crew and its various hijinks of failing at jobs and keeping out of the Alliance's notice. The movie takes the crew on a more serious turn, but the spirit of the crew is still there, plus or minus a few.

Kaylee is, in a way, the crew's surrogate little sister on the firefly-class vessel Serenity. A small-town girl with a big heart and no formal training, she was hired by Captain Malcolm Reynolds as a mechanic. However, she brings more to the crew than just her knack with machines. She's a bright touch of femininity brushed in engine grease and one of the few souls on board that's almost always bound to have a smile on her face. She's got a eye for sweet and fancy things and, while she might be interested in a certain city-slicker doctor, he has to share her heart with her ""girl"": Serenity, the ship with which she shares a special bond that goes far beyond your average mechanic/ship relationship. Kaylee's a curious soul and openly friendly to most everyone she meets as long as they're not either shooting her or Reavers, the Firefly-verse versions of zombies, only with more corpse-raping.

(Note: This Kaylee is taken post-Serenity, the film canon that follows the TV series)</small>

<b>Sample Post:</b>

Well, I gotta say it, lady. This is probably the best barrier I ever set eyes on. Works kinda like the shields on those new 10-90 models, right? Yeah, I thought so. It feels so nice and solid. That's not something you normally get with your average dome-type shielding systems, either. Those tend to be weak right about at a certain point. Mighty easy to break through if you're not careful. You best watch around this angle right here. Too much pressure and it's liable to snap.

Oh, you do get some people walking through? Well, I figured you might. Can't keep a shield going forever, huh? What kind of generator do you have going for this, anyways? It's gotta be pretty tough to keep all the folks in here. Too much force on either side and about any generator's just bound to bust. Just ain't possible to keep something that big up unless you've got multiple ones, you know. Helps to have back-up, too. You'd be surprised how often folks'll get one set up and it goes up like a firework. Flames and everything if you don't do the right sort of research into your parts. Folks just figure they can flip a switch and everything'll work peachy without getting down and grimy with the machine. 

Hell, I don't even know why some of you don't do that. No machine's gonna work right if ya aren't close and personal with it is all I'm saying. They don't even have to be new ones as long as they got the spirit. Really, your relationship with a machine is kinda like sex. Only with less naked bits flapping around. Can't have that too much or she'll start nipping off important parts.

You've got a good start, though. Whole bunch of folks here probably couldn't even figure how to get out, I mean, and I ain't talking about those poor excuses for Reavers you got in here, either. No wonder nobody's afraid of them if all they do is moan about brains.

... Nah, I'm not saying you should look into bringin' Reavers here. That'd be more than a mite stupid.

I'm just saying, with the amount of smart-looking folks you got here, zombies excluded, your set-up just ain't gonna work for long. Too much stress on your generator, for one. What I figure is you could route some of that power you're feeding into keeping all these laptops hooked up into a second one. I mean, it looks like not everyone's using theirs, and if you route all the power you're wasting on them into a second generator, the strain on the first would be lessened. That'd make everything a lot more shiny.

Aside from the whole being stuck here with zombies, but I figure we can handle that later.

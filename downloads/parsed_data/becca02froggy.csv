"event","Dear Asshole Who Broke into my House this Afternoon,

I'd like to take this moment to congratulate you for effectively ruining the holiday season for my family and stealing my sense of security.  It was truly kind of you to break open our door and carelessly strewn about all of our personal belongings, judging and taking the things you deemed worthy.  Things of high sentimental value to us will no doubt look great adorning the hands, arms and throats of you and your no-doubt shiftless, transient female companion.  It was especially kind of you to be sure to take antique things that had been passed to my father from not only his father, but my mother's father as well.  But you didn't stop there oh Asshole Who Broke into my House this Afternoon, no, you felt the need to take medals and other personal affects that will no doubt mean as much to you as they did to their rightful owners.  And please enjoy the hours of entertainment you will no doubt derive from the dozens of DVD's you took. I hope they were to your taste and liking, though I fear not all were as you left a select few behind, or perhaps they all wouldn't fit into the backpack you stole from my room to carry my things.  Thank you for trampling over things and turning out drawers to be sure that we didn't fool you by hiding things of value in with our underwear! And far be it from your willey self to overlook a gift-horse in the mouth, but how fortunate for you it must have been to discover medication! No thought for my mother who has had many recent surgeries and may be in need of it; I'm sure you know of some low-life ass clown who needs to get his high on much more! How good of you to be there to provide for him!

Thanks and have a great holiday,
 The Person you Violated

"event","I had one of those dreams that really fucks with you.  I dreamed I was at my wedding. I have no idea who I was marrying and it wasn't the focal point of this dream, but I was far from ready. Like, the ceremony started in a few mins and my hair was a rats nest and I had no makeup on, just the dress. My mom and all my ... I'm assuming bridesmaids, because I felt like we were friends, but I don't think I recognized any of them, plus they were all wearing the same dress, so either bridesmaids or girls with bad style. I digress.  In any case i was freaking out because I had forgotten to invite Mr. Ethridge. (At this point ppl who know who I'm talking about will be like WTF?! For those who don't http://becca02froggy.livejournal.com/80818.html ) Now you understand why my being hysterical that I had forgotten to call him is weird. My mom was yelling at me that it would be fine and we would track him down and I was yelling at her that I would be the first person to have forgotten to include him and that we couldn't go through with it until he was there. Someone was going to ""fake"" track him down because they wanted me to finish getting ready... and then I woke up. And my first thought was ""why the hell wouldn't I have called him way before then?"" And then I remembered his funeral and everything and I started crying again.
I wonder if people ever truly realize the impact they have on your life regardless of how long a time they get to spend in it."

"event","So I took a few days of PTO and today I spent watching the horror movie marathon on AMC. I didn't realize how many cameo's there were in Dracula 2000! Holy crap! That movie gives me chills even if it does fuck with the Dracula legend it packs one hell of a punch with its plot twist. Not to mention the brilliant, talented Gerard Butler is at his most attractive AND Nathan Fillion makes an appearance as *drumroll please* a priest. Haha; beautiful.

I love this time of year. On Friday I went on a ""haunted"" hayride at Blake's Cider Mill with some friend's for Scott's b-day. It was lots of fun, well, more the making fun of the teenage ""monsters"" than the actual ride itself. Although one of the guys swears one of the clowns threatened to ""rape his face"" so... it added spice to the idle ""you're going to die"" threats. But all in all it was fun.

Got my costume, but a part of it is broken so I either need to find a way to patch it up or find a new costume before Christie's work party Friday. Blargh! Besides that, I need to stop at the dollar store and find some beer steins to carry with me and I shall be good to go.

That is all; I have work bright and shiny tomorrow morning, but I did find a coupon for a free meal at PeiWei so that is my great excitement of the week as it is the easiest part of my week convincing Jen and Matt to to there at lunchtime. Mmm, now all I can think about is Mandarin Kung Pao chicken... argh.

Night kids!"

"event","I genuinely believe that, thus far, this year can be classified as one with a lot of struggle and not a lot of luck.&nbsp; To the outside naked eye a new job and a new car should be elements befitting a great year, but alas, those things are overshadowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To keep everyone up on the highlights: yes, I got a new car, as was mentioned in my previous update.&nbsp; Last Tuesday I was T-boned however and for the last four days my car has been in the shop having two new doors put on the driver's side.&nbsp; To be quite honest, had I been in the Neon still, I probably would have been injured... thank you Saturn Ion plastic outter shell with super rebound action. Irony that my first car payment for said car came due the same week it requires a $550 deductible paid on it's repairs. Hopefully, the person who collided with me's insurance will pick it up since I was not at fault.&nbsp;
In the continuing saga of my mother's health reflecting that of the vehicle I am driving: my mom went back into the hospital and they are unsure what is wrong with&nbsp; her exactly (hence her being there for day three even as I write this).&nbsp; Add to that the fact that my parents car has been in the shop the last few days and you have bliss within our household all around.
With the exception of those things; the job front is mixed.&nbsp; I have met a lot of great people and a lot of not so great people.&nbsp; Fortunately the former outweigh the latter in quantity and&nbsp;amount of interaction necessary&nbsp;most of the time.&nbsp; I've even started spending time outside of work with quite a few of them.&nbsp; I'm not making a lot, but I am starting to look over my budget for moving out in the next few months. I've had two people offer to sell me their condos, but I don't know that a condo is really an affordable consideration for me at this point, maybe in a few years.&nbsp; I still haven't completely ruled out just packing up and moving out of state, but since I don't have the overwhelming urge to relocate to any particular place it would be silly to start packing my bags.&nbsp;
In any case, I hope all is well for anyone who managed to read all the way to the bottom; take care!"

"event","Haha, FINALLY! ... yes I know.&nbsp; It only took me forever to finally make a decision, down payment and all that jazz, but on Thursday night my dad and I went to dealerships and I found my car.&nbsp; We were test driving and I turned to him and said ""this is my car.""&nbsp; He laughed, but I was right. I did buy that exact car; midnight blue 2007 Saturn Ion.&nbsp; It only had 16 miles when I drove it off the lot, but this weekend saw over 150 more.&nbsp; The amusing thing is that I have OnStar so maybe now I won't get as lost as I am prone to do (and there was much rejoicing).

My mom is doing a little better.&nbsp; She is still in a lot of pain, but she managed to go back to work yesterday as long and as she takes it slow she should be fine.&nbsp; 

Other than that, not a lot new. Not that I am a font of on-line introspection and sharing as a rule, but there isn't much outside of my brain going on worth sharing, and the stuff inside I will, as I normally am prone to do, keep to myself.

Oh! So there was a Heroes marathon on this weekend and I started to get drawn in.&nbsp; Generally I do not get into tv shows because then you begin to schedule your life around them and you are ""that person"" who gets angry when they miss their show or someone calls during it, and I try to avoid that at all costs.&nbsp; But, I have to admit I enjoyed it and even went to NBC.com to look up past episodes.&nbsp; Last night though I watched the season finale and maybe it's just me, but it seemed to wrap up WAY too fast for a show and premise that took so freaking long to unravel and develop. Plus, they ""killed off"" my favorite character.&nbsp; I'm sure Peter will return in some way since the show skips around so damn much AND comics are prone to not let people be killed off for good, but it seemed rather anti-climatic to me. Thoughts?

Hmm. 

I can't believe I actually had more to say about a tv show than my own life.

The last time it made a voyage to Utica I ended up having to call Scott and Justin to come pour in oil and shake their heads at me for having the car this long (thank God your husband is a sweetie Jen, lol.)&nbsp; In any case, I know you are asking: well, why haven't you bought a new car yet? Yes, I know.&nbsp; I haven't really had a lot of time to look since I was hired in as an Account Coordinator in March.&nbsp; I've been working a lot of 9-12 hour days. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday was the first day I've had off in a while, but that was only because my mom went in for another surgery.&nbsp; It is a follow up to the first and they have her heavily sedated with drugs to keep the pain at bay. So say a little prayer for her tonight if that is your thing.&nbsp; She will have an epidural in until at least Friday and I don't know when she will be getting out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm, what else is new?... My friend Josh is in the Avon Players and they are putting on ""Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up?"" but when I called the box office for tickets last weekend they were sold out... and now I hear this weekend is sold out too, so they must be doing something good.

"event","... though I kinda wish I had.

Last week, stretching into this week, has been the marathon of ""worst weeks.""&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It began last Sunday (not yesterday Sunday the previous) when I was on my way back from MP and my car died on the side of the road just outside of Alma.&nbsp; So Eric picked me up off the side of the road and we had the car towed to St. Louis to the only shop that was open on a Sunday morning. We were under the impression it was just a hose and would be done by 9 that night so I hung around MP and my dad came up to take a look at the car and talk to the guy.&nbsp; It wasn't done Sunday so the guy had us come back Monday morning.&nbsp; It wasn't done again, but since he was shooting for 9PM again this time we figured we would hang around til it was done.&nbsp; Again it was not. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday, Valentine's Day, morning my mom had a horrible stomache ache that had kept her up all night so my dad finally persuaded her to go to the hospital to have it checked out.&nbsp; She was then checked into the hospital where they said she would stay for 3 days to have antibiotics administered to her thru an IV.&nbsp; No big we thought.&nbsp; Thursday night they discovered another problem and rushed her into surgery at 9pm.&nbsp; (Noticing a 9pm trend of evil?) After the surgery her blood pressure was super high so they had her in ICU for a while until it leveled out.&nbsp; Needless to say it was a very long night Thursday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday was my birthday, but aside from phone calls, ims and messages (all of which I greatly appreciated) I did nothing that day except visit my mom in the hospital, eat Burger King, do laundry,&nbsp; and fall asleep around 10pm watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone with my dad. (We are moving festivities to this coming Saturday so gimme a jingle if you are interested in joining and I will fill you in.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thought we would get the car back Saturday so we could stop borrowing my grandma's car, but now it would seem that it needs a new engine so It will be costing upwards of $1,000 and will not be done until at least Wednesday of this week.&nbsp; My mom is doing better, she was on a ton of pain meds so she was kinda out of it, but will be coming home soon.

Thanks everyone who called and messaged and whatnot to check up on me and my mom, I appreciate it a lot. I hope life is treating you all a little better than it has been treating me these last few weeks!&nbsp; Have a good one."

You have embarked on a magical mystery tour, but you might not want your friends to know just how weird you are. Don't waste energy trying to hide your true self from others. It's quite likely they already know and accept your eccentricities.</i>

So I haven't updated in a while, primarily because I haven't had a lot of time, yet also because a lot has been going on that I don't feel warrants a sharefest on the internet.  In any case, I am still interning at Campbell-Ewald for the time being. No word yet of whether or not an actual position will be opening up soon, but I keep my options for one open.  I've been contemplating grad school, or just more school in general and odds are if you are a person bothering to read this, then I have already tossed ideas of such around with you.  It would really help if I had a path, but I won't trapse down that road of thought again (thanks for dealing with my hysterical random ass phone calls as I ponder the meaning of my life Jackie). The older I get the more I realize I not only don't have all the answers, but the ones I do are the wrong ones, or in essence, answer the wrong questions.  But who knows.  I am open to pretty much anything at this point and I just need the will and means to actually go through with something new, but I guess the truth is to some degree I'm still naive and scared, or maybe the throught that I am is what holds me back. How is it some people can pack a car full of stuff and relocate on a months notice and yet others never move away from the town they grew up in?  What makes us end up where we do? And how do we know if/when what we do is actually what's best for us? I wish to hell I knew. Alas, I'm going to head down the hall for more coffee.


Btw, check out the song... it's awesome."

"event","Is anyone else freaked all to hell about the new layout and  information provided by stalkernet, I mean ""facebook?""  Seriously, un-necessary. It's meant to make you more accessable.  Why call/e-mail your friends for updates in their lives? Check Facebook.  Want to know the name of that girl/guy in your 8am class. Starting a conversation with her/him the old fashioned way is completely un-necessary; you can now have your entire relationship on the web. You can learn as many facts about said person had you actually bothered to go on a few dates. You already know who their friends are and what interests they have, where they work and what kind of toothpaste they use, why bother meeting up for coffee? In fact, now you don't even have to worry about what to wear or fixing yourself up; just update your picture on a day when you are in the mood to bother with your appearance and call it good.   Plus, if they want to break it off with you all they have to do is unclick the box that says ""in relationship with .(person I am about to cut off at the knees, not that it matters since we've only met in person once)...""  Perhaps it's a new attempt at keeping crime- rates and youth pregnancy down; the longer 17 to early 20-somethings are stalking and ""making new relations"" on the web, the less time they spend getting into real-life mischief.  
If you really want to stalk someone, put in some old fashion effort.  And if you want to know what's going on in your friends lives, stop over with some beer.

You know that ideal love that each of us dreams of from childhood? That's you!
Not because you posess all of the ideal characteristics, but because you are a savvy shape shifter.
You have the uncanny ability to detect someone's particular fantasy... and make it you.

You inspire each person to be an idealist and passionate, and you make each moment memorable
Even a simple coffee date with you can be the most romantic moment of someone's life
By giving your date exactly what he or she desires, you quickly become the ideal lover.

Your abilities to make dreams come true is so strong, that you are often the love of many people's lives.
Your ex's (and even people you have simply met or been friends with) long to be yours.
No doubt you are the one others have dreamed of... your biggest challenge is finding *your* dream lover.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

In 1288 the Scottish parliament legislated that any woman could propose in Leap Year. The man may, of course, refuse but, by tradition, he should soften the blow by providing a kiss, one pound currency and a pair of gloves (some later sources say a silk gown). This law was adopted in France, Switzerland and Italy and the tradition was carried to America.

"event","A blonde decides to try horseback riding, even though she has had no lessons or prior experience. She mounts the horse, unassisted, and the horse immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle.

In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem to get a firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway.

The horse gallops along, seemingly impervious to its slipping rider.Finally, giving up her frail grip, the blonde attempts to leap away from the horse and throw herself to safety.

Unfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup, she is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves. As her head is struck against the ground over and over. As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere moments away from unconsciousness when to her great fortune... Frank, the Walmart greeter, sees her dilemma and unplugs the horse."

I'm so crazy busy lately; I need to get a bunch of stuff done for my classes and Ad Central, I need to find a job so I'm not unemployed in May, and I need to motivate myself to do the aforementioned things which is a feat in itself some days. 
I'm also trying to say goodbye to this place; the people and the places that have significant memories attached to them.  I'm realistic; I realize that a lot of people here I won't ever talk to again or I will for a few months and then we'll loose touch.  I think I'm getting better at being okay with that.
I'm sure whoever still reads this is saying: ""why is every infrequent entry about graduation and Waaa?"" Well, that's at the panicky forefront of my mind. I sit down to write something else and this comes pouring out.
I realize things I used to write about, like last years tirad on the Catholic church or all of the wonderful surveys were much more amusing... perhaps I will get back to that at some point. But for now, this is all I got. (Bad English yay!)

I think my biggest fear is losing some of the connections I've made and the people I see on a daily/weekly basis that I hope will continue to be a part of my life, but I suppose time will tell.

Sidenote: I would <i>kill</i> for a back massage right now; Lindsay and I went rollerblading around Tallgrass and through the residential area down Broomfield and I think I hurt in places I didn't know could feel pain. Rawr!

So many projects and shit to get done before the end and it's really hard to find the energy to do them; especially now that the weather is getting nice again.  The job hunt continues, but I know I'll eventually find something- anything. The thing is I'm not set in stone enough about what my future will be or even what I want it to be; I'm open to suggestions.

"event","What do you do when life isn't turning out the way you thought it would? Don't get me wrong, I had no illusions about a script coming down from on high and formulating a brilliant plan for my life, but where is my direction? Where is that sense that I am on the right track? I'm graduating in less than 4 months and what do I have to show for it? I feel like I got off the train at the wrong stop and now I can't figure out where I went wrong.  When did I become so scared of committing to the choices I make and people I include in my life that I've become what I am? Unfulfilled. What a word that is. So many dimensions to it. But I swear it encompasses the mood I'm in. Shouldn't I have more ""life experience"" at this point in my life? It seems like I should. I hate feeling silly and naive, but at times I do and it makes me angry at myself- I can't explain it.
I don't even know if I really like the field I'm going into. Yes... what does that tell you? I feel like I missed what I was supposed to do, but what the hell was that? What's my great talent or purpose and why does it seem so easy for other people, my age and even younger to be okay with mediocrity? Or are they really happy? They sure don't act it. I've been going out quite a bit lately and I watch people. I don't think they have things any more figured out than I do. I have no delusions. But why does the whole ""not having a purpose"" and not being able to pinpoint what I'm missing bother <i>me</i> so much?
Argh. A professor last semester told us: ""The semester before you graduate, if you have the mindset that you wish you could be a college student forever, then you are graduating before you are really ready. If you wake up every morning wishing you had a job to go to with a house, family, dog, etc. than you missed your exit and you should have gotten out long ago.  But you will know it's the optimal time to leave college when some days you wake up and wish you could be in college forever so you go out and party, while other days you want to get the hell out so you work on your resume' and surf the net for jobs."" 
Lately I've gotten into the habit of asking myself: ""what kind of day is today?"" And I realized I do have a mixed bag. I could go on about all the great things here, but I know my time is almost up. I walk to class and silly freshman walking from the dorms with last-nights makeup smeared down their face and tight neon sweatpants with obnoxious words on the ass annoy me.  ""Its college, have a little dignity""~~ yes, I said it. I realize those words aren't generally synonymous, but frankly they should be. We're all here because we want more than what we felt staying at home and not being here had to offer. So why is it often so cheapened? I'm not saying I'm any better at it. I do my share of going out, blowing off class for a good cup of coffee and conversation, and just plain not getting out of bed until I absolutely have to, but at the same time I feel like there is MORE. It's always more. I just wish I knew exactly what ""more"" I'm searching for and when will it be ENOUGH?"

I think you come to realize just how much they mean to you when you feel the necessity to explain them to complete strangers and they become jealous at the way you talk about them and your facial expressions while doing so.  If I contacted you tonight then realize that this is directed in most part to you because you, my friends, mean the world to me.  Things have been a rollercoaster of emotional ups and downs lately and I haven't been the most sharing (if you know me at all; when exactly am I?) but I'm doing better. Life is what it is and sometimes all you can do is make the most of it and enjoy the company of those who venture along for the ride..."

Bah! I hate her!

...Had fun last night, went to a party and totally forgot about the SAE pancake breakfast, whoops. It's going to be a long weekend though. I have to take 9 ads to final form for my portfolio, study for my JRN 350 final, and write an article for my least fav class.
Ad Club shin-dig tonight at Rachel's, Steve's ""wedding reception"" party, and Rob's hoopla. So we shall see where I end up; probably Rachels.
Next stop... Productivity Land, unless I get waylaid at Procrastination Junction. (A comment inspired by Mr. Johnston's latest article. Way to go out in a blaze of glory sir)"

"event","okeedokee...it's thursday and we have no school today 'cuz of that big party for our soldiers who came/is coming back. I FINALLY remembered the password for our website(our random101 one) and updated it muchly and I'm still trying to figure out how to get rid of that ""edge locked picture"" I accidentally added on the main page. u-u;;;; stupid thing has no ""get rid of"" clicky-thinger. I also started updating our RANDOM101 dev.account by adding a journal entry and added an icon to it. And we now have a livejournal: random_101. (random101 was taken ;-; )...I really made a huge update on our site and I might add a picture or two to our group dev.account when I finish some."

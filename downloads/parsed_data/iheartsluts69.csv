"event","the good news is i was dumpster diving last night in the north end, found a sweet ace dresser, a treasure chest, and a new kitchen table. and while taking out the drawers to be able to carry it up to my apt, my roomie and i found two shirts. one being black with the work ""ROCKSTAR"" on it, and a sleeveless green t shirt. thinking nothing of it and just hanging it out of my back pocket so i could carry the rest of the dresser up and continueing on my journey. upon further investigation when i got inside i found it was inside out. turned it right side in, and lost all composure and just started screaming. 

not only was it a) my favorite color, b) a scumbag-esque cut off sleeveless tee, and c) one'a those comfy feels...it has the word ""SHOCKERS"" written across it in white lettering, and a hand doing the shocker under the word. this shirt and i were meant to be. and it most definitly made my night. thank you life for ruling.



bad news is, i refuse to take it off and im really starting to smell."

"event","what am i supposed to even say on this stupid thing. creepy lurks are waitin for the new buzz. yuck. such a sketchy place to write about anything, and one should only do so if one's really got something good to say. alas, nothing good to say here. my works like a roller coaster ride. my love lifes a fucking joke. my apt is a non-stop wine drinking fest. and i dont even know how to open a bottle. lollercoaster. i miss my moody. my sisters coming out to boston for 2 weeks in july. kitlers a slut. yadda yadda yadda. 

re: work. the owner is like a dad to me. dad figures and i most definitly get into huge arguements a lot, so this is to no suprise. he tried to throw away my bed and stuff i had stored at work while i was on vacation, because i couldnt carry that stuff up any stairs, let alone my three flights. so, we got into a ""dispute"" persay. i called him a piece of shit, he told me i treasured junk. etc etc etc. he was in rage mode. i AM rage mode. we havent talked since. ill never get fired from that place. his wife's buying me a new dresser. the owner no longer has say in establishment, he hired people to do that for him a while ago. goodbye father figure number two-million and three. hello watching dogs non-stop through the month of july. buh-bye social life. <3

re: love life. HAHA. just ha ha.. im too much fucking work for anyone to handle, ive come to that conclusion. on one hand im completely cool with everything that'd happen in a relationship, can handle the big stuff completely and faithful as shit. but on the other hand, im a fucking needy ass brat with too many emotions to hold onto. i need constant attention, reassurance, compatibility, hardships, etc. mostly the attention. affection. i always need to be touched. told im cute. consistancy. whatever man. its not that im insecure. maybe i am. not with myself. just with my love interests. mostly just men in my life in general i guess. but nonetheless, my point is im a fucking joke when it comes to this stuff. im too needy and clingy. wear too much perfume. and get jealous over random ass shit. just be blantantly honest with me, and treat me like i treat you. thats alllllll. if i was with someone i completely trusted who knew how to work shit out with me (read: keep me in check), itd probably be the best relationship anyone would ever have...but until that day comes...""HAHA""

re: apt/wine. like i said, i dont even know how to open a fucking bottle. 

and last but not least. im stoked on the lil sis. shes a huge brat and drives me nuts. but i love her. and im the biggest influence in her life, so i gotta figure out how ima handle this situation. hopefully itll be okay. im probably gonna duct tape her to the back of my closet door and forget about her for two weeks.


im goin to go make mac n cheese cuz thats all i have left to eat. forcing yourself to eat sucks. i need a life. and someone to fucking pay my bills so i have money to buy real food. THANNNNNKS!!"

from someone whos practically thirty
im so excited about how tough people are


hey, at least you got yer sweet friends who obvs sold out their other friends for you, by your side...cuz id be way stoked on that too. 



you can lurk this, with all your spare time from sucking, and write me about how much of a cunt i am. and how im a lesbian. and gosh dang...i sucked someones dick once like three yeas back. how i must be a HUGE d-bag because i run my mouth online, not to your face. but if you'd like to really get into it, cuz its totally worth all the time and the effort obviously, you can call me. ill gladly talk to you. tell you to kiss my ass. and grow the hell up lady. 


HEY EVERYONE! LOOK WHAT I CAN DO!


you're way cool for cheap shotting someone who had no chance of winning a fight with you anyhow. how many people sucked your scene dick afterwards? ""omgz yer so awesome, i saw you kick that girls ass for no reason at all, other than you heard she hooked up with yer ex boyfriend!! AHHH! yer amazing!""

talk shit, get hit.....right?????
pff.

you can hit me too. at least itd be closer to a square fight. you can call me a bitch and tell me to fuck more doods too. i dont care. kick my ass. my life will go on. you wont burden my name in the ""hardcore scene"" nor will you ridicule me. im at the botton of this totem pole of shitbags. no losses. what satisfaction will you get out of it? you beat up a 19 year old lesbian who wears tight pants and thinks pooping is awesome? damn. thats a story for the kids later in life. go smoke some weed or something and chill the fuck out. find jesus. i dont care. nobody REALLY cares. like any of this matters in the grande scheme of things anyway. 

<3



stop hitting my friends unless they actually deserve it. i woulda hit her too if i thought she fucked my ex boyfriend, but you know what...i can do that. cuz i actually know the girl. and it'd be fucked up as my FRIEND to do such a thing. even if he was the one persuing her, and riding his bike to her house to try and get his dick wet. i dont care if he and i were broken up, itd still be disrespectful. buuuuut you dont even know her. what even really happened. nobody knows what happened, other than said individuals who were actually there. so why rub your nose in someone elses stinky shit? guh. you make me wanna go back to kindergarden and eat some crayons. cuz at least thered be a legit reason as to why everyone was wiping their shit stains on someone else, and why everything seemed so big.

i dont think im ever going to understand this image upholding thing that people seem to have the need to maintain. what are you so worried about? lifes short enough as it is. you shouuuuld just enjoy it. live it. love it. carry on. but people cant just be happy. they cant just let things go. they cant slow everything down and smell some fucking flowers. its the little things that make life  worth it. really. 
bahh. i dont know.


its really hard to not just be a lazy asshole about everything and just say fuck it. i definitly have talked to the tor about a certain person. if they hadnt done things the way they did i wouldnt have such a problem with them. theres really no need to explain it in here. they should understand what was so wrong if they have a brain, which is quite debatable at this point apparently. who cares. its not that hard to be honest about things. people get mad and they get over it. if you are up front about shit all the time, the latter problems of confusion arent there. guh. i just wish people could get real. seriously. who cares who likes ya. and who cares who doesnt. is that going to matter in 10 years? are you even gonna live 10 more years? you could die tomorrow. would you like to be able to look back (if thats even possible of course) and say ""hey, at least i had a good time. at least i fuckin did what i wanted."" 
i dont fucking understand why people feel the need to act suprised when things go shitty in relationships, or life in general. nothings meant to be perfect. nobody can be pleased at all times. i honestly dont know what i want to say about that certain individual mentioned above. i want to call them out on being sketchy and a liar. but did i not call that from the very beginning? i could see it all. and knew it was going on. though i just didnt care enough to mention it. do i need to be more straightforward with people and call them out on things as i see em? i understand shit way more than you think. i study body language. lips ears mouth throat. hand gestures. eye flutters. posture. twitch. i also study peoples minds. the way they work. or dont work. remember whos going to be a psychologist one'a these days? i get it dude. just act like this matters. acknowledge my understanding and realistic views. give me some credit. im not that bad of a person. there are far worse things to worry about. 

im gonna buy a vibrator, a laptop, and a huge sack of weed and get my jam on with that shit for the next couple months til i move back to shitbag west coast. but thats not to say there arent shitbags over here on the east coast. haha. the only three people i have had any sort of involvement with here were A) some crazy asshole i went on two/three dates with who ""fell in love"" with me, then broke up with me via voicemail two months later, even though i didnt even know about said relationship; B) a boy i had a super hero of a crush on for the longest time, kissed him in front of an icecream shop, have hung out with a total of four or five times, and wish he wasnt such a total flake or asshole; and C) fred. 

i dont know what im gonna do with myself for the next two weeks. there will be drunk dials and frost bite involved i assure you. so if you havent heard from me in more than a month, or if youve pissed me off within the last month. expect the call. delete the voicemail if i leave you one, i have a knack for rambling and/or talking to myself. dont try to save it and play it for me please. ill be better off not knowing. also, there will be drunk sledding on my behalf of course. with our new addition to life. summer. shes so beautiful. but smells of old pennies. haha.

where do i begin? and where do i end?
isnt that always a question with people?
""where am i going?""

pf. if we had the answers to these questions there would be nothing to inquire about life and explore in everydays living. i had to do a page of ""i wish..""'s (punctuation can eat me) for Creative Writing yesterday, all pretty basic stuff. i wish i was an astronaut. i wish i could grow wings like that dood in xmen. i wish there were seasons in the a-sizzle. i wish i was eating cheese pizza right now. i wish i didnt just take pictures of my roomie in a dress. i wish ligeia would have shown up. i wish i was a box of oreos. it made me laugh. i cant take anyone seriously, let alone myself. lifes too good to waste. live it.


i started writing this in an oddly good, yet inquisitive, mood. then i got heated due to unecessary drama involving a fugly (acronym of fucking&fat&ugly) girl with too much time on her hands. go start shit somewhere else. nobody cares what you have to say. in fact, you call me the theif....look at you and your life. who're you sucking the leftovers of? who are you trying to BE? HA. suuuuuch a joke. go steal someone elses LIFE some more. standing for what you believe in when you believe in nothing cuz you dont even believe in yourself, is fucking retarded. BLEH. im so sick of you. just stop talking already. its old. grow up kid.




why do people care so much about who likes them and who doesnt?"

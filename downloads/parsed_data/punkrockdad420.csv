"event","Cars suck. Know why? Because they are money pits. Inherently. At their core. They are designed to waste your money. Whether you rent, buy, lease, find, or steal a car, it will cost you your hard earned bread.
1. Purchase
2. Gas (thanks George BTW for the new energy bill. Good lord, could you pander to corporations any more you insolent, corporate-whore retard?)
3. Parts & upkeep
4. Towing. 

Yes, Towing. The ultimate end to a car's existence. If you can't change a tire or the battery, or add gas and get the car from one place to another, most likely, you need a new car.

So I'm driving to pick up my 3y.o. from daycare right after dropping $35 to fill the tank. My 84 Volvo starts making a funny noise, then it won't accelerate. I roll to the stop and everything shuts down. Won't start. Smoke is billowing from under the hood. Good night Irene. I had to go through the formality of towing the car to the place from whence it will be donated. I liken it to the trip from the place of death to the morgue. We can't leave our dead cars, nor our dead loved ones, on the side of the road for donation pickup.

The car is towed to my shop of choice, although not without a tow company SNAFU which they tried to charge me double for. I figured the shop would call me and tell me I need a new engine, in which case, I will donate the car, or sell it on eBay ( http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1,1&item=4566971884&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT ).
The shop couldn't do anything as they didn't have Volvo tools. So I had to tow it to a shop that did. They have not called me yet but the stereo in my Volvo is worth more than what I can get for the car so there is no way I'm paying for a new engine.

So I bought a new car.

Gas, $30. Tow, $106. Tow again, $85. Estimate, $75. New car $8500. More gas $50...and it will never end...ever."

"event","Journey. Life is a...no not that Journey.

Journey. The further you get from home, the longer the Journey back...nope.

Journey. ""Walk the Earth like Caine in Kung-Fu""...not that either.

Journey. Wheel in the Sky. Faithfully. Separate Ways. Chick Power Ballads. Steeeeeeve Perry.

Yes. That is the Journey.

I took my wife to Tahoe Saturday to see Journey. She is a huge Journey fan, and I thought it would be nice to do that for her, and I was right. I thought I would earn some points for sacrificing the time and money for the gesture, and I was right. I thought we would go and sit through 90 minutes of a geriatric band, going through the motions, playing twenty-year-old songs, and generally re-hashing their ""Greatest Hits"", and I was dead wrong.

First, the $9 burger. As per normal, the concessionnaires knew they could exploit everyone's hunger by offering up crappy food at exorbitant prices, and get away with it. I had a $6 Philly Steak sandwich that was forgettable. Shannon got a $9 burger from a different stand. Her burger was phenomenal. One of the best hamburgers I have ever had. As worth it as the $5 shake. It was the $4 can of Pepsi that was retarded.

Ok. I have never been a Journey fan. I have never bought an album for myself, only for my wife. I have only ever heard their songs on tired classic-rock radio that other people had tuned into, or in my youth when they were contemporary and I didn't know any better.

I saw the Journey Behind-the-Music on VH1, and watched as I watch all of them, and gained a minimal respect for the band as they had originated in San Francisco.

I knew that Neil Schon, the lead guitarist was regarded as an excellent musician. He was 15 when he joined Santana and had been a 19 year-old, local phenom/prodigy when he formed the band, so I went into the show, thinking it was good that at least I would get to see him play.

My wife played the greatest hits CD during the 2 hour drive, and I was surprised at how many songs I recognized, and even more so that I knew the words, but that's what over-exposure can do to a person.

The band kicked-ass. 

They started out as a jam band and would jam at clubs in the City in the early seventies. Their first set was an hour, and it was prodominantly 3 jams, and a couple other songs, almost all of them showcasing the fantastic rythm section, and Neil Schon's brilliant guiitar work. Being a fan of the Dead, Phish, Widespread Panic, Santana, etc. I dug the shit out of it. I was pleased. In a sea of power-ballad cheese, there was actually something for me. That and the Mullet watching was OFF THE HOOK. I haven't seen that many Mullets in one place since the last time I was at Wal-Mart in Russellville, AR. There were som fine specimens, although its not surprising. Nothing goes with a Journey CD better than a Camaro and a Mullet.

The second set was for the ladies and fans of classic-rock radio. Schon did go off on a couple of solos, though, including a jamming Hendrix/Santana medley with some riffing on Voodoo Chile and Third Stone From the Sun (my favorite Hendrix song, and the sampled melody heard in ""I'm Too Sexy"").

We even got to run around a couple of South Lake casinos afterward although I mostly sat outside while Shannon gambled. I let her because I have a gambling problem. I always lose.

I was duly impressed. They were really good. I had a good time and I earned hella points with the Wumpty."

"event","I was watching Real Sports with Brant Gumbel yesterday and one of the contributing reporters was doing a story on Evander Holyfield. The story outlined Evander's complete mental and physical decline, due to having his brain bashed repeatedly over the last 20 years, and his refusal to stop fighting. This moron just keeps going, even though he has deteriorated to the point of not being able to react properly. Two points that were made that were the most tragic: you can see in his face his desire to throw a punch but the connection from brain to arm does not move fast enough to beat the next stimulus so his hands don't move, and his reflexes are gone, such that he can't react to a punch that has three feet to travel before it mashes his face.

It is so sad. Death in the ring is more tragic. Evander Holyfield is just sad, pathetic, heart-wrenching. 

Dude, Evander, I never was a fan anyway, but you gotta stop.

What really got me in the piece though was the ""reporter"", speaking with Gumbel in the traditional post-story chat described Holyfield as having ""tenacity, stubbornness, and 'sticktoitiveness'..."" Excuse me? ""sticktoitiveness""? How can a ""reputable"" journalist use a contrived word-mash like this. Sticktoitiveness is NOT a word. Here's an idea, instead of using a cliche'd mash of non-word, JUST USE THE TWO WORDS YOU SAID BEFORE IT, THAT MEAN THE SAME THING!

"event","I was fortunate enough in the 80's, not to fall for the hair-band tragedy, e.g. Warrant, Poison, Bon Jovi, etc. although there are many who were victimized, and now ashamed.

I was fortunate enough in the late 90's, not to fall for the Rap/Rock tragedy, e.g. Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, etc. or the Boy Bands like Backstreet Boys and NSync. And I shied away, thankfully from the Power Pop of Creed, Collective Soul, 3rd Eye Blind, et al.

I was fortunate enough in the 00's, not to fall for the crunk tragedy, e.g. Nelly, lil John, Ludacris, etc. And I am the better for it.

(Can you tell I am not a big fan of commercial music?)

But like the fans of all of these bands, most of whom keep that fandom in their bone closet, I too have my own secret indulgence.

I saw the Scissor Sisters for the first time on Saturday Night Live, and at first, I was just attracted to the woman at the mic. Her name is Ana Matronic, and she captured me immediately. She has a striking face, reddish hair, and a soft body (Cue: Spinal Tap, Big Bottoms). I also couldn't stop watching the rest of the band. Most of the band, I think, is gay. So they are flamboyant and fabulous (Not that us breeders are diametrically opposed to flamboyance or fabulousness)and fun to watch perform. 

It was the song though. The song is what really got me. The Scissor Sisters performed a cover of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. Now this wasn't your run-of-the-mill cover. This was stylistically Bee Gees, complete with the high voice, meets Daft Punk, with the driving, neo-disco rythm + lyrics of one of the greatest songs ever. I thought it was great. I watched it a few times after the airing cause it was TiVo'd (but not as many times as QoTSA w/ Will Farrell or Green Day's American Idiot performance), chalked it up as a novelty, and then spent the next few months trying to get the song out of my head. 

So Saturday, I bought the CD. And it is good. Real good. The style stays with an electronic drive and an urban sensibility, but the songs are very well written, hooky, and stick to the brain. This will be the CD I stick behind a box, on the top shelf of the closet when I have company. Or if somebody gets in my car and this is in the CD player, we will listen to the radio. But nevertheless, when I am alone, I will crank it up and groove."

We stayed at the Westin St. Francis on Union Square http://www.westinstfrancis.com/
http://www.starwoodspecialoffers.com/westinstfrancis/so.aqf
This is one of the oldest hotels in the city and has a storied history. The hotel consists of two buildings, the original hotel built in the 1800's, and a hotel-towers, built in the early 70's. The hotel sits facing east onto Union Square, and there are glass elevators on the east side of the towers. When you make your way in these elevators up to the 32nd floor, you can look down on the city, across the bay, and see the Oakland hills. It is breathtaking, and I was able to shoot video. My grandmother used to take my brother and I to San Francisco every Christmas, and we always went into the hotel to ride the glass elevators, so it was appropo that my Grandmother ""funded"" our stay, in a rondabout manner. The elevators are also one of the first things I shared with Shannon when we started dating and went on our initial SF trip, for X-Mas shopping in 1996, so again, the hotel had a special significance.

Our room was great. There was a King Size bed, internet, tv, a sitting room, and a huge bathtub. This was no motel 6. The only drawback was the view. We were on the North side of the building, and our low, 5th floor window, allowed us to look only at the sides of the buildings around us. But we weren't there for the view from the room.

After we checked in, I realized I had forgotten to pack any socks but my knee-high maroon baseball socks. (I was going straight to my games on Sunday so I had to pack my uniform.) I walked a couple blocks to Macy's (like Dillard's)on the square, and bought a few pair. I had also failed to pack cologne so I bought a bottle. While I was there, I noticed a display of silk robes and boxers. Now, Shannon has bugged me for 10 years to get a black silk robe and boxers, and I have never been able to find them, so I took advantage of my opportunity, and later, my wife!

Back to the room, we had about an hour to get ready for dinner. We had reservations at Fleur De Lys, possibly the best French restaurant in the US.
( http://www.fleurdelyssf.com/ )We made it a little early and were seated anyway, and then came the most amazing food experience I have ever had. Without wine, the meal was a little under $200 w/o tip. With wine, it would have been over $350. But lord, it was worth it. If you ever have a chance to have a 5-course meal, prepared by one of the pre-eminent French chefs in the world, do so, regardless of the cost. And if you do, keep this in mind. Order what you know, but still eat what you don't, because these men know more about food and what tastes good than you do. Shannon is not the most exploratory diner, yet she now understands what it means to be under the spell of Foie Gras and black truffles. We both now have a deeper jealousy toward the tasters on Iron Chef.

After dinner we walked around and made our way back to the hotel. We ordered ""Kingdom of Heaven"" on the in room pay per view, but wound up not watching it. (Cue the ""married couple + hotel room + french food date + silk robe"" music.)

Whenever we stay in downtown SF, I like to get up and walk around early, buy some fresh sourdough bagels at Boudin bakery, and some fresh flowers from a street vendor on Stockton, then go back to the hotel and watch TV. So I did. I walked down to Market and around the neighborhood, did my thing, and went back to the room. Shannon was still asleep so I read a little, watched some baseball, and took a nap. We both got up and showered, then went for a walk. We stopped in this little Irish store and bought some stuff.
( http://www.irelandstreasures.com/guinness.htm )
Then it was on to Lefty O'Douls for a corned beef and cabbage sandwich.( http://sanfrancisco.citysearch.com/review/863541 ) We drove down to Pier 39, where Shannon left our camera in a bathroom, and finished the afternoon with more walking around. We drove back to the hotel, and then to SBC park and met up with my Dad and Liam (David has been in Arkansas since July 19) for the Giants/Marlins game. ( http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/national/pacbel.htm )

In the midst of the Giants getting pounded 16-4, we left the park and headed to our favorite restaurant in all the land, L'Ottavo.
( http://sanfrancisco.citysearch.com/review/863521 ) We found this little place, again, on or first trip to the city together, and the combination of food quality and romantic atmosphere have kept us going back as often as possible. We always go there when we stay in the city, and we even make the two-hour drive sometimes, just to go to dinner there. Once again, the meal was great and I ate myself stupid. I was so full, we didn't order dessert. I actually walked out fatter than I went in. The night was over, and we had to get up early, so we went back to the hotel and tried to watch ""Kingdom of Heaven"", but to no avail...again.

Sunday morning we got up at 6:30, had breakfast in the hotel, and drove back to Sacramento. I had a 10:00 double header, so we picked up Liam, and I dropped Shannon and he off at home, and proceeded to the game. We were playing the Giants who were in first place. A sweep would have tied us in the standings, but we split. Considering they threw their best pitcher in game 1 and only beat us by 2, and we were missing our two of our best hitters, and both our pitchers threw with dead-arms, we did well. We shut them down in game 2, and showed them that after all their shit-talking and swagger, they really aren't as good as they think they are. If we play them in the championship series, they are in trouble. The temperature outside was 107, and needless to say, when I got home after the games, and that weekend, I was pretty trashed. 

Shannon and I needed this. We hadn't had a weekend like this in over two years, and it was Shannon's first truly healthy weekend in all that time. We will do it again, but it won't be soon enough."

My team will have 6 representatives, as we are in first in our division, and 2 games behind the league leader, my former team, with a Double Header against them coming up on Sunday. If we sweep, we will be tied for the first playoff seed, with 4 games left against the two worst teams in the league. We are in good position, and we have a quality team so I think we can do it.

 Worst fortune ever 
Current mood:  annoyed 


OK. I'm pissed. I just got done doing this whole entry about how stupid my fortune was. It took me a while to type, I made up like ten clever fortunes, and I was proud of it. I added my music and tried to post it. I came up with a bad page, the submission didn't take. But then it erased all of my typing and I couldn't get it back. My fortune was wrong!

Fortune: ""Your efforts will be worthwhile.""

What a crock.

"event","Whether this addresses any current issues or is totally superfluous, whether or not you or anybody else agrees, wants to hear(read) it, accepts it, or ever thinks on it again, and whether or not this succeeds in helping or hurting you, this is what I think/feel, and I am going to let you know it. I intend to pull no punches, and keep in mind that my thoughts are inarguable and should be canonized where necessary.

First, let me start by reiterating to you the characteristics that I have, in my infinite wisdom, determined to be THE most important in a human being:

1. Intelligence - characterized by wit, PRODUCTIVE(!) self-evaluation, a tolerant mind capable of change, and self-preservation (i.e. no Darwinian blunders so far.)

2. Capacity for love.

3. Ability to positively affect the life of at least one other person, wherein you become party to their capacity for love, such that, even in your abscence, their life is different AND better for having made your acquaintance.

(Again,I believe that I am fundamentally and absolutely correct in holding these, AND ONLY these, values above all others, whether the context is spiritual or not. This is inarguable. And I understand I am an elitist and that my opinion of my ""correctness"" is by no means humble. My way of thinking is more important and more valid than ANYBODY else's, unless they agree, in which case, theirs is just as important and valid.)

Allow me now, to outline the depth to which you possess each of these characteristics. Beginning w/ intelligence. This is the most immediate characteristic in determining a human's value. There is nothing worse than a stupid human and in your case, this is fortunate, because you are not one. You possess wit and it is apparent in your being clever when artistically expressing yourself. You are also genuinely funny which in itself requires an awareness of wit and ""cleverness."" You may not necessarily be ""book-smart"" but you do have the mental capacity to apply to learning when it is required. (This is an untapped potential you might probably should tap.)As far as being open-minded, you are that. There are certain areas in which you are misled, and therefore intolerant, specifically in regards to homosexuality and with other things that are puritanically(religiosly)held to be deviances, but for the most part, you require adequate information and experience before reaching judgement. And you are streetwise, no pun intended, and would survive were you completely alone. It reminds me of the joke about an Arkansan's last words, ""Hey y'all...watch this!"". You are, to date, still ""with us"" without ever having done something ridiculous to ""end it."" You are evolutionarily advanced. 
It is not uncommon to underestimate one's own level of intelligence, but I am sure if you TRULY took stock, you would agree that you are a smart one. 

You are a loving being. I can see it in your devotion to people. You express it in communication and by virtue of communicating. It takes, in my experience, righteous folks to express care for others, such as when you post glowingly about your niece, and you allow the vulnerability of expression, which a lot of people don't do. You have relationships that you may not qualify as love, but indeed are, which hurt and exasperate you, thrill and excite you, and that you deem so important that they affect your feelings of well-being. And indeed you share yourself with those you care about. You take what they have, and allow it to change you, and you give of yourself. In fact, you give of yourself excessively sometimes, even to those who don't deserve it, or to some when the result will be no gain to you. You genuinely care for others for no other reason than they exist and you make them prove to you why you should not love them, if that is ultimately to be the case, meaning you have a humanity that is rare. These are all important skills (yes, they are learned). They prove empathy and your ability to sometimes put others and their feelings in front of your own for the sake of being righteous. You are not selfish which is a hindrance of love. 

And finally, you are special, rare, unique in that your presence is something cherished. You are sought after. People are drawn to you because you have so much to offer that is unique to dub. And what you offer alters lives. You make people different from the moment before they knew you, to the moment you become acquainted. A person is changed. Because of what you offer of yourself, your intelligence and capacity to love them. You have an artist's soul. Artists, change people whether through a piece or just by way of being. They change people on purpose and by chance. And you do this. You resonate. You leave your mark. People do not forget that.

When I met you, I was older, from California, liberal, more experienced, and had a family. I am different from you in so many ways. I am married, college educated, with two kids, a corporate job and a tumultuous (recently)life. Different. They say ""opposites attract"", but this is fundamentally not true. People are only ever acquainted with those who are ""same"" in a varying number of ways which we are, but not in those ways that typically allow people to relate, and certainly not in terms of proximity which is the most important of the ""same""s. I haven't even been in the same room with you in almost 3 years, yet I think about you almost every day, and not just on the days which include the immediacy of my contact with you or ""reminders"" of you on my computer at work. 
You have an influence in me. You have impacted my life, changed me, made my life better, helped me to understand life and the things about it that I hold dear. And I appreciate that, even though that was never your intent. And that's my whole point. You do this because you are you.

In everybody's life there are those who come for a time and then go, those who are permanent fixtures for better or worse, and those to whom we are attached and lose due to life's only ultimate certainty. Within that framework, we all have people we are happy to see go, some we are ambiguous to letting go, some we regret letting go, some we hate to see go, and some we won't allow to go. You fall into the last group for more of your peeps than anybody I know. You have folks that GENUINELY care for you, are concerned for your well being, and as I stated, won't allow to go, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. This is not because you are a vagabond by nature, cause you are not (rather, an opportunist). Think about the diversity in the people you have surrounded yourself with over the years and consider you their friend. How different are (just from MY web of knowledge): Demetrius, Myself, J. Jolly, Peanut, Blake, Kristen, Will, your parents, your sister, your niece, Tato, and any close friends you might have in the NE. (and again, this is only MY frame of reference and you can add people as you wish.) Think about how unsame all of these people are in every aspect...except one...you.

KNOW what I say to be true. Carry it with you and realize that although you may not believe it sometimes, and you may make mistakes, or do things that are contradictory, or show aspects of yourself that fog these truths, that does not mean they are absent or altered. This is you.


And to anyone who might think they disagree with me: you are wrong, and nobody asked for your input anyway."

I have a wicked ear-infection (tits ok, I'll finger it out). My ear is swollen to the point that I can't fit a Q-Tip in it, it hurts to swallow chew and yawn, and the best part is, can't even go to the doctor. You see, my wife just started a new job last week. She is a Nurse so she gets almost free health insurance. At my job, I pay like $430 a month for coverage. Her benefits were supposed to start on her first day, the 20th of June. So on the 21st, I cancelled my coverage. (That money per month is necessary for other stuff.) Well, my beautiful wife didn't finish her sign-up process, so we don't have ANY coverage! Good times.

I pitched yesterday. I faced 5 batters. The first one popped out weekly to 3rd, I struck out the next 2, walked the 4th, and the 5th popped up to 1st. 1.1 IP, 0.00 ERA, 1BB, 2K. Not a ball out of the infield! I was even doing the Eric Gagne hop at the end of my delivery.

They just couldn't catch up to my 65 mph fastball!

Current mood: Incredulous


but I really have nothing to talk about.

My oldest son finished 5th grade today. He will begin 6th in 2 1/2 mos. That means he will be in Jr High in about 14 mos. Holy shit! I 'm a young Dad. I will be 35 when he turns 16. 38 when he graduates from H.S. 42 When he graduates from college. 

All you guys who haven't had kids yet are looking at your late 40's/early 50's by the time your kids graduate from H.S. 

I will be 40 when I buy my son his first drink. (Legal drink, let's get real) If he gets lifted at the same age I was my first time, I will be 33. If he does it at the same age my brother was, it would have been a year ago!

My age when he (at the equivalent age to me): 

Loses virginity: 36

First Drinks: 32

First Tokes: 33

First gets arrested (as adult): 38

I will be young enough to party down with my kid."

"event","I am a Giants fan. Born, raised, and bred to bleed Aranjada y Negro. My first game was at Candlestick Park, 08/05/74. I was 1 day short of 5 months old. I have been a season ticket holder every year that I have lived in California since 1997. When it was announced they would move to Tampa, I cried. When Kenny Lofton drove in David Bell to beat the Cardinals in 2002 and Duane Kuiper yelled, ""They're goin'!!"", I cried. I still cry when I hear the replay. When Dusty pulled Russ Ortiz in game 6 of the World Series I screamed. When he started Livan Hernandez in game 7, I screamed again. Dusty Baker is single-handedly responsible for the most disappointing, heart-ripping 24 hour period in my entire life. My point is, I love the Giants.

I am a Dodgers hater. Born, raised, and bred to boo the Dodgers blue. My 3 year old learned to say ""The Dodgers Suck"" shortly after he first said ""Daddy"". My 11 year old has had a ""Fuck the Dodgers"" button on his pin-hat since he's 8. My point is I hate the Dodgers.

Therein lies my quandary. My favorite Base Ballist is a Dodger.

Eric Gagne came out of the bullpen last night, with a two run lead, to ""Welcome to the Jungle"" blaring through the LA night. He weore his pants baggy and low, his jersey a size or two too big, his game hat faded and rippled with white sweat stains, and he has dark curls spilling out around the base of the cap. He sports a goatee, wears Oakley scrips, and just looks like Base Ball. He is Quebecoise, and his wife is a French model. I had an instant desire to change my jersey number to 38. And then he pitched the 9th. The man got the first two batters out with 82 MPH splitters. The third batter he struck out. He threw another 82 MPH split, followed by a 95 MPH fastball, and then a 68 MPH curve ball. The man is devastating. 

For those with a minimal understanding of Base Ball, the velocity of the pitch determines the batter's reaction. The speed and arm angle of the pitchers delivery determines the batter's interpretation of the velocity. The batter watches the first pitch come in at 82 to guage the velocity. 13 MPH more on the next one and he almost can't see it, then drop 27 MPH and the batter has finished his swing before the ball gets there, because Gagne throws with the same speed of motion, from the same arm angle, so every pitch looks the same, unless a. its by you, b. you swing too early, or c. you get lucky.

The man embodies everything I respect about a ballplayer. He has individual style, he has confidence without being an ass, and he has amazing ability. 

I just wish he wasn't a Dodger.

I arrived at one of my own games, and a teammate payed me the highest compliment. He called me ""Gagne"". It was unintentional then, but I too had the glasses, goatee, curls out the sweat stained cap, and I am a large man. He made me feel like I was Base Ball.

BBQ

Can you beat good BBQ? A smoked pork shoulder, most and tender, with a sweet, smoky sauce with plenty of heat? Or some fall off the bone pork ribs?

The only thing better is a sandwich.

But NOTHING beats a BBQ sandwich.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Git-R-Done?

Good catch phrase...but unfortunately for all of you piece of crap, racist, ignorant, NASCAR, mullett, wife beating, trailer, Budwiser, redneck, cock knockers that say git-r-done like its a redneck phrase of honor, THERE IS ONLY 1 LARRY THE CABLE GUY, AND YOU ARE NOT HE!!!!!!!

It should not be cool or trendy to be a conservative, intolerant, gay-hating, idiot. It should be legal to put a bullet in the head of everyone who says git-r-done, that is not repeating a LTCG joke!

Larry the Cable Guy IS funny.

----------------------------------------------------------------
I play baseball. I am in a men's hardball league in Sacramento and I run the team. We are the Sun Devils and we are good. We have our 5th game on Sunday against a team we beat before by like 20 runs. In the first game, the other team, my former team, came back on us and won it late. It sucked, but we have won 3 in a row since. I have gone 0-3 w/ a walk, 3-3 with a walk, a double and 4 RBI, 2-4, and then 1-3 with the game tying RBI. Iam not the best player, but I get better every year and am pretty good. I am proud of my defense.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I have been listening to a lot of Queens of the Stone Age. They are bad-ass. I haven'ty heard the new record, but Rated R and Songs for the Deaf are awesome.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Launchcast from Yahoo is a great way to listen to music.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What's up Tato!? Thanks for getting in touch. It was good to hear from you.

------------------------------------------------------------------

In April of 2001, Dub got us passes to the Papa Roach show in Springfield, MO. We drove up from Arkansas w/ peanut and his lady, Will and Tato. Will wound up not being able to get in cuz he didn't have his ID so we stayed out in the parking lot. While P Roach were haging by there bus, an old friend of mine from California drove up in a golf cart and turned out to be the PR guitar tech. So we hung by the bus with the band, they got Will into the show through the back door, and a bad night turned out well. On the way back, Tato and I discovered a mutual affinity for punk rock music, and had a great conversation. 

I like Tato.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used to DJ on my college radio station and I played a lot of punk music. I even had Dub in studio as an on-air guest. I read my son a bedtime story on the radio too. I wish I could do that again."

"event","I celebrated the New Year last night...by myself. My kids are at my parents and I am picking them back up after work today so I had some tequila and beer and mexican food and watched the Cal debacle on the Home Theater. The Relleno and Chili Verde Burrito from La Placita were UNBELIEVABLE, and you can never go wrong with Anchor Beer.

So on to the funny part: I decided to begin the evening with a couple margaritas. What I did not realize was that my margarita mix was not mix, but margaritas in a bottle, with alcohol, just add ice.

"event","Death is all around us. Not surprising as we are all living, and death happens. I recently lost my last Grandparent, a famous football player that I watched just passed at 43, I work in insurance and I just got a claim in which the driver whose property I was assigned to pay for was deceased in the accident, American soldiers are dying almost daily in an asinine military action in Iraq, and 125,000 people + were instantly swept away by a force of nature in Southeast Asia. These things should bring brevity in the reasonable person.

Its not dying that I fear, it is no longer being alive. Never waking up from a dreamless nap. Life is amazing, and it is, literally, the only thing we have. If you are ever having a bad time and wish you were dead, or can't figure out life, please be thankful that today you are awake and you can enjoy anything that makes you happy (like a sandwich) because you are among the living. You just have to make it happen for yourself sometimes. Besides, the alternative is not very appealing.

I am away from my wife, kids, parents, brother, friends, etc. right now but I love them all, and I will be alive with them as soon as I can. For that, I am thankful.

No, really, NoFX is really a great band.

Quizno's has the 6"" Steakhouse Beef Dip Sandwich for $ 2.99 so I had to enjoy one with some chiken soup, Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips, and a Diet Coke, no ice, two lemons. That was a satisfying lunch.

-----------------------------------

Anchorman is a really funny movie. I give it three thumbs up. On the Home theater agenda tonight: Cal football in a bowl game (they got screwed!!!), Open Water, Collateral, and some Madden and Star Wars KOTOR all accompanied by a 6-pack of Anchor Steam Beer and a bottle of Cuervo 1800 silver. Then my sweet pillow!

Our company gave us adjusters gifts yesterday. They are glasses with some sideways palm trees, surrounded by: ""Charley 8-13-04, Frances 9-03-04, Ivan 9-14-04, Jeanne 9-25-04."" As some of us assisted in handling claims and calls from the Florida storms, these are a nice reminder of the most catastrophic insurance event in history. The best part...THEY'RE IN HURRICANE GLASSES!!! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! 

I almost fell out of my chair when mine was given to me. Hurricane glasses...how cool is that?"

I like sandwiches. No, I REAALLLY like them. I think the sandwich is the perfect food. I mean, think of all the possibilities. Breads, cheeses, meats, veges, condiments, cheeses, cheeses. The mind boggles. Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Subs. Sandwiches all! I could spend eternity coming up with every possible combination for all the sandwiches ever. And sides, and drinks, and...oh my...my head is swimming.

I prefer lightly toasted rye, with brown mustard, corned beef, lettuce, tomato, kosher dill, lots of swiss. Give me a side of Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips, some potato salad, or chicken noodle soup (depending on the season), and a Guiness, or Pilsener Urquell, and I am golden.

---------------------------------

I just got surround speakers. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox in Dolby Surround...unbelievable.

Listen to good punk rock. It is underappreciated. NoFX is one of the greatest bands EVER!

Have a good day."

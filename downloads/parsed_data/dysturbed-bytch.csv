Ah i need a beer...or 10. Jesus christ ive been sober for 2 nights now and its driving me nuts.

My family came up here this weekend. Well whats left of it. My mom came with my sister and brothers, my dad surprised me and showed up. it was great, sorta. till my sister decided honesty is the best thing in any situation, little bitch gets it from me. HAHA. anyhow, all weekend she went off on my mom about her retarded boyfriend EVERY SINGLE FUCKIN CHANCE SHE GOT. made me feel awkward, and at the same time sorry for my mom, i dont think she realizes how much she hurts me or my sister. Ah, but alas, hopefully christmas will be better. CHRIST BEING SOBER EATS BIG PLASTIC DICK!

Well, i just got back yesterday from a 2 day weekend in Minot. I spent some time with Scotty B and Dre. It was awesome. Dre cocksmacked my friend wendy like 5 fuckin times. LMAO, she fuckin loved it. Anyhow, she was fakin the funk, the reason she went down there was ta fuck my boy. But when it came down to it, she never did. Anyhow, me an him had a great time hangin out and laughin at my cocksmacked friend. After that, We got some alcohol and he left i guess about 1am. Got buzzed, drove around till like 5am and came back ta the hotel room ta kick it...or sleep. Fuckin slept all of the next day, practically. i did end up waking up at 3 and taking my shower, called scotty b and he said he would call me back so i took my nappy and woke up when he called me back.

I went ta his house an watched some PS2 till almost 2 fuckin AM, then watched ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" LMAO THAT FUCKING MOVIE OWNS. I recommend it to all you boring shits. 5am rolls around an were tired as shit an go ta sleep. The next day at about 12:30, i leave ta go home. sleep the whole fuckin way, come home at like 2:30, shower, sleep again until 9PM lastnight. jesus christ, i swear ive had more sleep in a day than ive had the whole weekend.

Only to come home...to more drama. yay.

My dads got something like tonsilitis combined with the flu. Shitty, actually. Oh, and my mom still aint really seen or talked to my brothers. fuckin shit is gettin old, and im about ta bitch her out real mother fuckin soon. Yea, you can say i am a little pissed the fuck off because my grandma is fuckin telling me that when i was 6 goddamned years old, when my mom first left me and her, my 1 year old sister was calling ME mama. jesus tap dancin christ, that aint happening this time.

This year Roni would like some of the following.

1.  A nice MAC10, for when fucknuts, retards and jizzaddled cumqueens piss me off. You know, as well as i do, there are too many people in the world anyhows. Retards, that is.

2.  Id like for you to talk ta that God dude an tell him that the world is full of bitches whining about stupid ass bullshit and tryin ta commit suicide, and drowning in self pity and loathe, while people with terminal diseases or people who get scraped off some street with a bullet ta their head are dying to live...You really should do somethin about that.

3.  Please, give my mom something that lets her know shes 37 an not 20 anymore. And that she doesnt need to compete with me for anyones attention. An tell my dad that there is a life outside a mother fuckin casino and money doesnt buy love.

4.  Id also like a plane ticket and enough money ta get me goin out in the real world, instead of a US third world country type deal in north dakota.

5.  Please, supply me with enough patience and morals to continue to put up with these fuckheads until the day of my armageddon, or until some of them grow brains.

6.  See, me an God dont talk much, were on bad terms right now, but if youd be so kind as to ask him to bring back Scotts mama, it would be greatly appreciated.

7.  This list is getting kinda lengthy.  But i do have one more request.  Id like a new house, for my moms, so she doesnt need to be kicked out every goddamned week for doing stupid bullshit. Id like for her ta be well off so all the fights will stop, the accusations will cease, and both of their unhappiness will be taken care of.

Thanks and goodnight...PS...i been a good girl. *halo appears*"

She went all psycho an whatnot an came after me. Thats when i tackled her ta the ground an was on top of her with my hand across her throat an told her...""dont fuckin make me do it"" and once again, the bitch said ""do it"" So i fuckin cracked her in the jaw. She cried, but got up like 2 mins later an tried ta attack me again...*sigh* I pushed her onto the couch an fuckin told her ta behave an she screamed at me...thats when i fuckin hit her again right in the eye. Needless ta say she kept crying and then i heard ""OH MY GOD"" and she got on the phone. Apparently, when i hit her, it swelled up right away to the size of a golfball. Anyhow, we aint talked since, and she didnt go to school yesterday because of her eye. but i dont really give a shit. I honestly doubt she'd wanna try me out again, because she doesnt bitch anymore. Mission accomplished.

On top of that, my dad put my mom out again. *sigh* Shes staying with my aunt. But, she needs to fuckin learn to act like a mother more than my sister. My own fuckin grandma even told me i was more mature than her. Jesus fucking christ, the bitch has 4 kids and is 1) never home. 2) doesnt give a shit about what happens and 3) is probably having an affair with a kid younger than me just to fuckin prove to people how young she can be. I swear if i could beat the shit out of her too, i would. But i guess thats where my morals come inta play...goddamn them. Anyhow, im sick of the bullshit and ill be glad when the fucking divorce happens, tell you the truth. 

Yup, and even my ""father"" whos been MIA for 19 years wants to have a say whether or not i go to baltimore. FUUUUUUUCK THAT. He told my dad that i had a site somewhere that showed my address and all this bullshit and my phone number...excuse the fuck out of him, but all he knows how to fucking do is turn the goddamned thing on. AINT NO SHIT LIKE THAT ABOUT ME ONLINE. An you can take that mother fuckin shit ta the bank. Fucker thinks he can be ""wonder dad"" after being a stranger for 19 years. fuck him. Anyhow, my dad is ready ta fuckin let me go an be on my own.

Oh, and today i talked to my Ex. Hes upset and or jealous or whatever the fuck because he found out i was thinking of Baltimore. JESUS TAP DANCING MOTHER FUCKIN CHRIST!!! ""dont go to baltimore, roni"" OH, sure ill stay in north dakota just because you say so. No, it dont work like that my friends. I got invited, ima do everything in my power ta get the mother fuck out of north dakota.

I guess what im tryina say is...FUCK EVERYONE.

Happy mother fuckin Holidays, fuckwits."

My fuckin ""friend"" is after my uncle, the baby girls dad. Hes got a girlfriend and 2 babies an shes still tryina fuck him. Lastnight she started talkin about him an she shut the fuck up when i fuckin told her about it. I know for a fucking fact that if anything happens ta fuck wit my lil cousins or anything, its both they asses. ...stupid fucking whores...

Thats how most days go, anyhows. I did try ta get a hold of scott, got his celly number changed. Tried ta get a hold of my ex...phone is disconnected. That little crackhead. In other news, moms an pops are back in the saddle, thats kinda sick of me ta say shit like that...BUT YAY!!! I guess my bitching ta them about being so goddamned childish paid off. I guess when the time comes, ill bitch about why theyre so on and off an on the verge of divorce, but thats not important right now. 

I guess you can say most this annoyance is caused by me an my best friend since we were fuckin 2 years old...we been losin touch lately. HAHAHA theres fuckin competition tween my friends, yo. This friend is tryina outdo this friend for my best friend LAYCEE's friendship. They both tryina outdo me, kuz they know she trusts me more than anyone. Fuck it, im just sick of the mother fuckin drama. Eh, it ain my problem. Its up ta her. I guess if we were ever best friends like we say, we'll come back tagether. She did invite me ta go wit her ta Fargo for a night, so we'll see how that goes.

Im really in the mood ta fuckin get my rocks off an get fuckin dog ass drunk. But, we'll see again.

"event","Well, i thought i was having an aight day until about 15 minutes ago. Someone told me some weird shit about my brother like figure Scott. Asked me about him kuz of all people they thought i would be the one to hear from him...Alas, nothing. for the past month ive been thinking about if hes aight, too chicken shit ta fucking dial his celly. I dont feel shit for alot of people, but hes done so much for me and im to the point where i dont know what the fuck to do, heartbroken in a sense. Its deep. The week started out to be not so bad, but now im back at square one with trying to get into the fucking mood everyone else is in due to this whole holiday hype. Im not feeling it this year.

Usually emotional pain aint shit for me to keep up inside or just to say fuck it and brush it off. Ive been told time an time again that its made me ""angry"" and ""irritable"" and almost unbearable ta be around. My own mother calls me heartless. crazy stuff. Even about that, i dont really give a shit, but it just sticks out in my mind. Well, ill fuckin tell you why i dont give a shit. Its because of times like this. I dont like to fuckin be in a shitty mood all the time, most the time over shit i have no control of. Im trained to say FUCK IT, FUCK THAT, an FUCK YOU. Thats been me since the 7th grade. its easier to brush shit off than feel like your heart is getting broken again over and over. Most the time over insignificant shit. But, i guess once your heart was broken, it never seems to stop hurting till the day you die. Ive learned that, so far. These days i feel like the keyboard is my only escape, my only friend, and my only outlet. Id rather tell total strangers this shit than tell any member of my family, and i dont really feel like i can even talk to my ""best"" friend about it. It all comes back to the fact that no one understands how i feel...when they say they do...theyre mother fucking lying. Anyhows, thats all i have to say, if you have any advice for me...please...its real appreciated. Later."

LODDY FRICKIN DA! Mother fucker was forward. an pissed me the fuck off. Dude, i like to flirt with girls, because theyre not as fuckin forward as guys are, and the thought of an old guy hitting on me grosses me the fuck out. Anyways, i guess you can say im in a good mood. Nothing bad happened, i made it to class today, ready for the finals.  My dumbshit cracked out ugly whore of an ex has been back in touch for some odd reason and wants me ta go see her. HAHA, i told her if i went i wanted ta see my homeboy Dre an she got all upset an got the vibe that i was using her...DING DING DING! WHAT DO WE HAVE FOR HER JOHNNY!!! HAHA fuckin dumbshit bitch. Anyhows, i doubt ima go, kuz if i gotta spend time wit her id rather not.

Well, i find myself thinking more and more about my ex. After all, ive been told if the love is real, its indefinate and you never stop feeling it. I thought that was so fuckin true.

Anyhow, (i really say that alot) Im excited because i getta go play volleyball tonight :D thats my passion baby. Too bad i only getta play on wednesdays, but its fun. Not like theres anything else ta fuckin do around this shithole state. Anyways, im done bitchin. LATES!"

Pops is out winning G's everytime he fuckin gambles. Thinkin maybe he has a goddamned thing rigged.  Eh, whatever keeps him in a good mood is alright wit me. Moms..haha...moms i dont really know about her.

Nicki called me today. YAY! I aint expected her ta an when i answered the phone i was somewhat relieved in a sense kuz i was bored as fuck.

I am however, kinda bothered by fuckin crackheads who DEMAND my attention. I mean, if you dont have my attention, trust me, its you. so get the fuck over it, yea? Anyhow, i guess im just stressed because of the fact that finals are next week. i guess i should be excited but jesus fuckin christ, so much preparation for a simple ass test. Ill be excited when i get the fuck out of this place. Next weekend tho im out like a fat bitch in dodgeball, goin ta fuckin fargo. It ain much but it sure as fuck ain belcourt, thank christ.

There is an upside to all this.  I met alot of nice people from this thing so far, plus this is a great way ta get out frustrations an get feedback...look at me sound like a goddamned fucknut. HAHA. but seriously, its got me hooked.

Anyways, i should be on yahoo for awhile, if you wanna get ta me message ""the_baby_baltimore"" Lates."

"event","I went to the Delta Zeta formal last night it was pretty cool. I got really pissed off though because they played the fucking phi kap song twice. It shouldn't have been played once but when people are already calling this dance a fucking phi kap social and they play the song well that adds to the insult. Don't get me wrong the Phi Kaps are cool guys BUT there were guys from Sig Ep, Sigma Nu, me from Sigma Pi and some independents and that was really shitty that they make a HUGE ass deal about the fucking Phi Kap song. Not only did they play it twice but the fucking girls got all into the song and then the girls got pissed at me and some of the other guys for not wanting to dance to it. i wouldn't make the DZs dance to the fucking Zeta song or the fucking AOPi song so don't make me dance to the fucking Phi Kap song and once again they are cool guys but it is rude to pull that shit that is like the Yankees playing the American anthem twice when the Toronto Blue Jays come into town and totally ignoring the Canadian anthem just not cool.  

I had a good time though so don't get me wrong and once again the guys in Phi kap are awesome but that did rub me the wrong way"

Speed limits are just suggestions 

You have at least two friends who have no idea what their relatives do...because its ""top secret"" government work

Most of your senior class wend to Mason, JMU, Tech, VCU or UVA

When people ask where you're from, you tell them DC because its easier to explain 

You've never told someone you're from Virginia without putting ""northern,"" ""central,"" or ""southern"" in front of it (See above.)

It's not actually tailgating unless your bumper is touching the car in front of you. 

You know yellow light means at least 5 more cars can get through. (Yeah, man...at least. Probably also happens everywhere else.) A red light means 2 more can.

You actually know what the black boxes at stoplights are for.

Despite the fact that Virginia fought for the south in the Civil War, you are not, under any circumstances, a ""southerner"" 

You are amused by visiting relatives who are actually excited to see Washington, DC

You took a field trip to Williamsburg as a kid

You are amazed when you go out of town and the people at McDonalds speak English

You or someone in your family has a Smart Tag

An inch of snow and you miss 3 days of school

All the potholes just add a little excitement to your driving experience

Crown Victoria = undercover cop 

Subway is a fast food place. The transportation system is known as Metro, and only Metro.

They just tore down the old farm house across the street and put 12 new McMansions in its place 

For the cost of your house, you could own a small town in Iowa

If you stay on the same road long enough, it will eventually have three new names.

You have to dial the area code to call your neighbor

""Vacation"" means spending a day at King's Dominion or Busch Gardens.

""Going to the River"" means any stream with water.

You have never been served tea without the waitress asking ""sweet or unsweetened?""

Your favorite past time is telling West Virginia jokes.

Anyone who can't trace his or her ancestry back to at least four generations in Virginia is an outsider.

""Going to the beach"" means anywhere from Ocean City to Virginia Beach to Myrtle Beach.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Virginia.

16)and Chevy Capris too

17)I don't know I call the Metro the subway Metro kicks ASS

Homecoming pagent was awesome. One of my brothers told asked who I was going to hit on that night and I told him I didn't know it's a suprise. The suprise worked out well and we have a new runner in the contract singing derby. The Buffalo sabres and I hooked up last night and probably again tonight but this deal is more of a rent a player thing you know for their hunt for the Cup I really don't want to sign any long term deals with her but she could be fun to play for. The New Jersey Devils have spoken with others about contract negotiations BUT they haveyet to contact me AND when I have spoken with her she shows little interest but my ""agent"" says she wants me on her team.

The Cardinals are playing the Red Sox in the World Series go Cardinals Jess should be happy when I see her in Government. :)

I was invited to the Delta Zeta formal as a starter andnot a back up but at this point I don't have money to rent a tux. 

I realized last night though that my Sigma Pi brothers think I'm a pimp but I realized that only a few of my teams are Stanley Cup quality. Looking at those girls in the pagent only made me want to better  my game even more and damn I'm still not in the same league as Dani McLean but I'm probably inviting her to Sigma Pi's formal when we have it."

"event","So on my free agency (dating thing) It looks like I have a few seriouse competitors

So of course Super Nova is the Washington Capitals in this scenario and of course if I had my way I'd be a Capital but last night I considered some other contracts that I have been offered.

I have recently been flooded with offers from at least 30 girls which helps this annology out greatly because there are 30 NHL teams. I have really narrowed the choices down though. I won't play for the Penguins so there goes one but last night I hung out with an Opra major who will be represented by the Ottawa Senators (man I'm so Peter Bondra like) I hung out with her before I a few times before I met Super Nova or Sigma Pi and I really liked her but I just never really got a chance to hang out with her. Due to ROTC forcing me to volunteer at the football game though and her going through the wrong gate I was able to hang out with her all night. She helped me take tickets and just hung out with me it was awesome. We went and hung out with my brothers for part of the game and then headed back to my place were we rocked out to Good Charlotte and I found out that the Virginia tourism moto is a good come on line. 

Me:something dumb about Virginia
her:isn't Virginia for lovers
me:yeah let me show you

ROCK ON she almost gave me a hickey though but damn it was sexy as hell and I think the Ottawa Senators are a pretty cool team.

Now don't get me wrong I am also looking at offers from girls who represent the New Jersey Devils, the Atlanta Thrashers, the Chicago Blackhawks, the Nashville Predators, and the Carolina Huricanes BUT these offers are only being politely reviwed because I think I have definatly narrowed it down to the Caps and Senators at this point with of course the Caps leading by a large margin but due to one problem lets just say that they have a player on their team who hurts team chemistry we'll call him Jaromir Jagr it could stall the signing phase. Also don't get me wrong I will so totally sing with the Rangers if they send me a quality contract it's to early to say any thing really.

Last night was awesome I got to know my brother Danny aka Greg (at least I call him Greg) very well Greg kicks ass and we are trying to figure out a way that we can be roomates and make Blue leave. We went to the best place on earth according to my roomate Oxford last night. I was kind of upset because I didn't see the legendary oxford band who from what blue tells me is the coolest group of people around. We then watched movies with our brother Joseph and our friend Merideth. Eurotrip was just as good the second time I saw it and hey you got to love that song ""scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know"" it holds a special place in my heart now. We then watched Mallrats which is one of my all time favorites just because that movie and the upright citizens brigade got me over the whole Lauren Ross thing in 10th grade.

Cavi couldn't come down tonight :( but he'll come down some day

Hockey is still on strike BUT the AHL isn't and the Norfolk Admirals beat the hated Hershey Bears 3-2 :) and they go at it again tonight in Hershey go ADMIRALS but I'd still rather be cheering for the Caps :(

Today I have to work the JSU football game that I was forced to ""volunteer"" to do by ROTC but at half time I can hang out with my brothers and plus I get 5 bucks so suck it ROTC

I talked to my dad last night he sent me a check for my fraternity money and his letter kicked ass. I love the hell out of my dad and he is really proud of me being in sigma pi. I talked to him on the phone to thank him and he was really happy for me . 

Oh I skipped all but one class yesterday. I was about to go to math until my friend Ohio Aaron from Sig Ep stopped me and we went to breakfast and picked up his car from the house.  I then went to State and Local governement because my buddy Jess is in there and class was awesome. Then I said fuck going to Sociology I'm to damn tired so I hung out with sorority girls and then passed out in Joseph's room while he went to class overall it was an awesome day and I think this weekend will kick ass just because it started with such a good thursday night Sigma Pi part.

oh that party kicked ass and I got to hug Dani McClean and my brothers are going to help me talk to her she is an aO pie so rock on. Don't tell my alpha z friend though ;)

Shepherd students belive the government will and should give them the world and how those who oppose equality are evil. While the majority of JSU students realize the government is flawed  our politicians fuck up but we need to vote according to common sence and reality. 

On that subject though my roomate now feels I'm racist because Tokir and I were talking about Bush and Kerry and Will kept interupting and I said listen are you going to vote he said no so I said well don't waste my time by making me listen to your voice because if you don't vote your voice doesn't matter. Then I explained to him what my government teacher told us that most Kerry supporters don't vote and when I told him that I pciked my words wrong and said ""most people like you don't even vote"" so he assumes I hate black people but he is a fucking idiot and no one likes him anyways and besides I know I'm not racist. Plus besides that dumb ass lit his face on fire

I absolutly have to go to PT tomorrow which sucks :( 

oh yeah my three fears lets go indepth like I promised.

1)heights I just can't stand them uless I have a railing or something 

2)stingrays scare the shit out of me I'm always worried that while wading in the ocean or even the Potomac river in the mountians or in mountain lakes or streams that I'll get stung by one even though I know the chance is slim to none

3)alice and wonderland was a fucked up movie and for some reason when I was a kid my grandpa and mom thought I loved it and made me watch it all the time I would cry whenever I saw that movie I HATE it even today it's jsut fucked up maybe if I was a stoner I'd love it

Rome sucks ass. I went to Sunday school at church then left it was so boring. My mom was cool though so it wasn't all crappy. I had a decent time with Charlie I played some Armurchi Indians football in Wal-Mart you know the kind were you fumble the ball around and throw shitty passes kind of like Menchville Monarchs football now that I think about it but hey guess what high school sports suck so who cares. Did everyone know that Bill Blaskey is a Son of a Bitch!!!! Charlie had me laughing with that. Then Charlie and I helped track down a thief at Blockbuster it was funny as hell. I'd much rather hang out at JSU then in Rome. This summer I'll be spending most of my time in DC and when I am in Rome I'll probably be chilling with Cavi and some people I met here at JSU. Then it's off to bootcamp :( but hey I guess It'll make me a man.

I called that chick from alpha z who likes me who knows maybe i'll chill with her sometime. I'm seriouse though the fuzzies and DZs are ok but i would rather listen to maps with someone else ;)

I also hung out with joey and cary it was prety cool we watched the UCB Fraternity episode. Chumbawumba guys and Mongo would never go to the mall with lady of the lake Mongo wouldn't even park near the mall with Lady of the Lake Mongo hates Lady of the Lake. even though she is emerging for me. We all fell asleep afterwards and then this morning I beat joey's ass hahahahahahahaha I made him surrender like France. Then I came to Rome.

I got a lot of stuff for school today like a new shirt and some ties so i can look good at the sigma pi meetings. I really don't like Rome anymore it sucks here especially since i can't make the tv downstairs work but hey I got the new Good Charlotte CD so rock on"

without your love 
so long ago I cant remember now 
where we began 

This is Victor my life is an extrodinary event. That song has no meaning other than the fact that the song is beautiful and it is running in my head like 24/7. It's all a champaign super nova in her eyes and just chilling with my fellow sigma pi. Joseph is my brother now kick ass but he is also Livy's dad(?) I don't know what is up with that. I hung out with super nova aka skeezy mckgee after class it was pretty cool we ate lunch with some of my brothers (I love being able to say that) and I met our sweetheart who is awesome sigma pi loves you Cambry (sorry if I spelled it wrong). I also helped introduce super nova to Cambry so I hope she goes ZTA. I smell sex and candy (man that song rocks). I feel so good and energized today people were coming out all around to introduce themselves to me I felt like I was a king or something it was so presidential or governor of virginia. The other night I was really tired and I was bitching about shit to Joseph and I said i wanted to start a buffalo farm. I don't know why i wanted to buy a buffalo farm but after I read the Catcher in the Rye I wanted to own one because I felt kind of down but fuck the buffalo farm life is an amazing thing damn I'm in contact personally with the AOPi social head, the DZ girl's, Phi mu and ZTA o yeah Alpha Z to man it kicks ass being in a frat. Alright Victor Ward is out and hell yeah my nephew Trent is so going to be a legacy when he gets old enough and I have a nickname now they call me mongo lord knows why but I'm like awesome I'm the first guy in Sigma Pi at JSU with a nickname given to him by the other brothers at least that I know of"

"event","so I saw that chick again we watched Rules of Attraction for like my 51st time ever and her 1st and she liked it. The fact that she liked ROA is a major plus. She couldn't stay the night again though which sucked but it was ok because paul bunyon lied about not staying the night and came back like 30 minutes after she left. It was fun though because we listened to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and made out and just talked kind of like a more mature middle school date. After she left I put in Taking Back Sunday's new CD and totally passed out on my bed. I slept so much yesterday to make up for not sleeping friday night. I almost fell asleep at the football game that JSU won :) at the game I hung out with Justin and Joseph and a few of the sigma pi brothers which kicked ass. I really like these guys and I can't wait until 7 when we become official. I think I'll work on keeping my tan today  because it feels beautiful outside but I have to do laundry and shit. Life kicks ass and I know I was bitching about shi last night before I went to bed for good but man I was tired as hell and can you really belive someone who says they want to leave everything behind and just start a buffalo ranch (which would be awesome though)seriously though life kicks ass"

Last night we went out to this bar Brother's to go check out one of my new brother's band. It was pretty cool. I met this awesome girl there who I thought was very hot. We wound up hanging out in the Daug. It turns out she is in my government class and I didn't even realize it but to my defence she didn't either so it's all good. You know it is pretty damn hard to miss one hot chick who sits in front of you in a class with 10 people in it. She also works a civilian job for the national guard unit i'm assigned to in huntsville how about that patriot missile's and a hot chick kick ass. I hope I see her again tonight I had so much fun.

I'm chilling at the football game today go gamecocks beat murray state and my other gamecocks beat the alabama crimson tide"

I have gotten a sorta bid to be a founding father of JSU's newest IFC fraternity Sigma Pie (they told me to have the check for 150 writen out to them so I'm pretty sure I'm in). On sunday we colonize and then it is my job and my brother's job to learn everything about the frat and look for guys who will help represent our fraternity. I can't wait until Sunday when I get my founders pin.

I leave to take my ASVAB today which should be awesome. I get to stay in Nashville for free but tomorrow I have to get my physical after which I will be a member of the Army National Guard. 

I really am looking foward to this sunday I can't wait to be on first name basis with all the sorority girls and to be a part of a true brotherhood. Oh yeah my name will forever be on the original cjharter for the fraternity and when we get our house built people will know my name for years to come it kicks so much ass. Charlie get your act together and come to JSU in the spring because I am gurenteeing you a bid.

Well the next football game after we colonize is in 2 weeks so I can't wait to go out there and help recruit so we can charter wish me and my future brothers luck. Mary let your DZ sister's at Shepherd know that Sigma Pie in Jacksonville Alabama is who they need to know.

Oh yeah why the hell are babe the blue ox and paul bunyon hanging out all the time. damn those two dumbasses where at waffle house 2 nights in a row for the enitre night and it isn't like paul bunyon isn't cool it is just the fact that his tall tales are getting really old. Babe the blue ox is a little faglapper though and he is not welcome to hang around me at all. Maybe if Paul Bunyon cleans up his act and learns how to treat women I'll help him out in the spring to get into sigma pie but if he keeps acting the way he is he is not going to get in and the fact that he hangs out with babe is really hurting him more."

"event","ok so yeah last night sucked ass and has thereby ruined today. 

Last night the plan was to rent Mean Girls and then sit and watch it with Audry. I had this all romantic night planned out it was going to kick ass. Well since I'm the Washington Capitals of life it didn't turn out like that at all. First off the walk to get Mean Girls took a lot longer than I though because we ran into Livy befor heading out and Livy told us an hour long story about losing her wallet which I didn't mind but it was fucking with my plan. Also Blue was all bitching at me because I hang out with Audry a lot and he said that it should be bros before hoes whatever. Well we walked there and got the movie and had a generally good time of it. 

Upon returning we decided not to watch the movie since Blue stayed in the room but I remedied this by saying hey Audry lets go study under the stars in the quad. Well this plan was kicking ass until we had the talk.

The talk sucked so much ass. It was the I love Chris, but I love you Michael but we can't be together because I have loved Chris for 4 years speech. The speech revolved around the fact that if she was single we'd be dating, if her and Chris had been together for only a few months we'd be dating and that since it has been 4 years though she can not leave him no matter how much she cares for me. ok so if this speech didn't already suck it sucked even more when Livy comes in the middle of it and interupts us for another hour about her damn cell phone ringtone. I don't have a problem with Livy but this message needs to go out for everybody who would do something like this. IF TWO PEOPLE ARE SITTTING ALONE TOGETHER UNDERNEATH THE STARS AND ONE PERSON HAS THEIR HEAD IN THE OTHER'S LAP THAT MEANS DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT BUG THEM WITH SHIT YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY TALK ABOUT LATER.like i said though I'm not pissed at Livy and I know you read this Livy but honestly that shit was not cool

Then to make my night even worse I almost popped Whitey in the face. the ra shawn finally got the balls to ask a girl out and he got stood up so whitey makes fun of him well that shit is not cool I was really proud of shawn and we all almost beat Whitey's ass I also told Whitey I don't ever want to hear him mention Audry's name ever again because if she isn't dating me there is no way in hell she will ever date him and she doesn't even like the kid as a friend so fuck off whitey.

Also I am very pissed that this one chick tried to show pity for me last night that shit is not cool and I know you mean well but it could have waited this person did not have to call me right after the incident happen and I am very pissed at the person you know who you are and I am still yolur friend but seriously do not talk to me for a few days and if you do DO NOT MENTION THIS SHIT

Today has been better though I've actually gotten a few #'s and stuff so kick ass. I'm thinking about having a Victor Ward weekend it will be so awesome. I might be buying some Vallum just so I can totally feel like I'm in a Brett Easton Ellis book because this shit is so Rules of Attraction"

"event","ok i stole this from my friend josh's LJ because hey it is about my dumb ass brother Sean. I think he is in jail and that is where he needs to be for what he did ok read what he did

Josh LJ:i had to help convict a felon on thursday-- so i had to miss school-- thursday night sean decided to go onto base.. with shawn-- toi get money withou havuing to pay the 2
.00 surcharge...and sean-- being sean-- had a TON of illegal weapons in his car. let's go down the list-- we got busted.. WE because I was in the car too-- WE got busted for 

3 swords of various length
1 billy club
1 baseball bat wth various colors of paint and dents all over it
1 illegal bowie knife
and added to that, a case of smirnoff... 

buuut we would have gotten off with nothingmore than a simple confiscation if it weren;t for the handgun. DAMN SEAN;S STUPOID ASS. it was a pellet gun.. but it was a look alike.. and when the cops found it.. MAN were they pissed. haha.. the only reason sean wasn't arrested right then and there was because when they picked it up, it was lighter thna a real handgun. damn sean's stupid ass...end Josh's LJ

Ok my brother is a dip shit he is in the damn army he SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO BRING THAT SHIT ONTO A MILITARY BASE. i got to much shit going on in my life to feel sorry for him and if he is in jail then tough shit kid grow up why the fuck does he need swords anyways. is he fucking king arthur or something.

Well anyways this weekend has kicked ass other than sean being bin laden of the 14 hundreds. The huricane Ivan hit and i was one of the only people that didn't evacute fuck that in Newport News we hung out in that shit. Joseph and i stayed here and Audry and livy stayed as well so i chilled with them most of the week. joseph and i have watched like 50 movies and we hung out in daugette when the power was out it was scary as hell. most of the weekend lately though I have been complaining how i miss audry she is with her asshole of a boyfriend now in huntsville. 

Joseph was saying that he might ask her to marry her this weekend but he was saying he was just joking. He really thinks she would say no because he thinks that she has some deep feelings for me and i think that is true but i'm pretty sure if he does ask her she will say yes. Joseph doubts it. He said that she might actually break up with him this weekend

This guy is such an asshole and I feel like a dumb ass but I am like so totally in love with her during the huricane when the power went out i sat next to her and rubbed her neck and we just talked. Then that night i slept on the floor in Joseph's room and  I wound up talking on the phone with audry for 2 hours after joseph went to bed you know those phone calls were you speak all quit and say stupid sweet things. i hope Joseph and everyone else is right in there thinking that she really cares for me as much as i care for her man i'm such a fucking dork,

Oh yeah livy keeps hearing babies and elmo when ever she walks by abercrombie hall isn't that weird"

"event","So yeah I'm here at JSU. It is pretty cool. I miss my friends from Rome though and Shepherd of course everything was much more chill back at Shepherd. JSU kicks ass though the main reason my roomate kicks ass.

My roomate Will is awesome and after 2 minutes he was cooler than Cowboy Bob. Will takes showers which already throws him above Cowboy. Will is from Oxford so we hang out with a lot of his friends and family and his family kicks ass his dad bought me the best damn burger ever. We hang out at this dude Patrick's house a lot he lives in an apartment off campus and we hang out with this super hot chick from Miami named Beca. Her attitude so reminds me of lindsay lohan's character in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.  We ate at Jeffersons which kicks ass and we just chill. I did duster(not angel dust that shit you clean keyboards with) one night but won't again but man that shit was awesome. We also hang out with this guy John who is kind of a dork but he is still cool to hang out with. Most of the chicks here think there shit doesn't stink but everybody has been saying that so it isn't anything personal the guys who have been here said that act will end soon.

I'm going to Rome on Friday to cash my paycheck from bbv and then I'm going to a rome braves game. Charlie we should really hang out because after the game I plan on giving a shout out on the radio for the tribe. I probably won't spend the night like I originally planned because JSU opens the football season on Saturday and I was kind of invited to the Kappa Alpha party.

Well peace out. And I regret I missed the battle of indian head and I still agree if robert e lee had ford excursions the south would have won that battle. Oh yeah I got my rotc uniform i have to get my fighting gamecocks badges put on it though."

"event","it was like my 3rd night at Shepherd and I was hanging out with a bunch of people I met at Orintation that day. I met these two guys ben and Spanky who reminded me of a National Lampoon movie which fit because their favorite movie was National Lampoons Van Wilder. I also met these 4 girls they knew I think they were named Jessica, Katie, and Kristi, and Ashley 3 of the 4 were hot and after eating diner we all hung outside the dinning hall in that little amplitheather there and when it got dark we walked across the bridge  into Maryland down to the CO (Chesepeake and Ohio Canal) we headed to this place by the river were a lock used to be and almost everyone was smoking cigarettes I wanted to sit by Jessica but this one dude was sitting next to her I can't remember his name but he kicked ass so I sat next to Ashley and I rubbed her back while I flirted with her. We also met these guys chris and this guy who used to be great friends with him who now neither can stand the other and Chris told us about the Mothman which scared the shit out of everyone who was from West Virginia but for someone from Newport News Virginia who hadn't seent he movie it didn't do to much. Well Chris got a cell phone call and told us he got us invited to a party at some upper classman's house. We all headed back to Shepherd and drove towards this guys house. The house was by one of the last 7-11s I ever saw and when we got to the party I realized it sucked immideatly as did everyone else. 

This was like the first party I had ever been to and when this dude started telling us we could buy Natty for 2 bucks a pop I was the only person that didn't realize that was a rip off. Well the girls went out and bought some Skky Blue and I drank some of the Skky Jessica gave me. The party sucked I was hardly drunk and the only highlight was talking to Jessica the rest of the time was spent watching tv and the guy got pissed when I told him his cable package sucked. Well we left after an hour because it sucked so bad and I went and slept up in Cowboy's room and listened to him tell stories about his then GF back when he was normal and took showers and wasn't a pot head. I remembering watching GI Joe and getting all pissed off at it. Cobra was creating a super general by combining the DNA of several famouse generals and most were what you'd expect until they got to count dracula who I never knew was a great general. I then passed out under my Capitals blanket from exhaustin not alchol and the heat due to lack of a/c was unbearable.

We all spent the next day going to orintation classes and at the one about racism the guy called me to the stage and was explaining how it is good to be different. He used me as an example to say that him and I were both good people even though we were totally different. Afterwards I met this chick I wanted to hang out with so much at registration because she was so hot and she invited me to chill in her room since we were both political science majors.I FUCKED THAT UP THOUGH  my dumb ass stood her up for a chance to go to Harpers Ferry but I always did love Harpers Ferry though I only saw her one more time and she was transfering to a school in Baltimore. Well back to another event that happened during the orintation thing. I think I'm allergic to Skky Blue because I was sick all that morning well this guy from Ocean City who I hung out with at registration gave me his Power Aid and tothink I had no idea this kid was gay until he told bob when we went to walmart in charlestown that he has nothing to worry about with him stealing the chick dara from bob. 

That trip to Walmart was the same trip that I met Mary on and I totally hated her when we first met now I think she is awesome even though WE BOTH piss each other off from time to time. I still hadn't met Kristi yet I just remember seeing her a few times while moving in and my dad saying she was pretty and me thinking that she looked pretty and I thought she was greek like the Ducleracasis at my high school. I'd meet Kristi maybe 6 days after this."

"event","It was the annual Saint Patricks day party for Lamda Chi Alpha at Shepherd and I had gotten an invite since I was still a prospect for the fall semester (the semester i didn't even attend). I had shown up early because I thought the party started earlier then it did so of course I  felt kidn of stupid there. I spent the hours before freezing my ass off in the West Virginia winter standing in front of Mcmurran counter-protesting the Anti-Bush Anti-Iraq War protest. I almsot got my ass beat but Danny who basically oraganized the event saved my ass. so anyways I ran out of there just in case somebody decided to flip on me for my views plus I wanted to get ready for the party. I spent time fighting with Cowboy Bob about something stupid (who would have thought he was involved with something stupid). Then I chilled with our basically roomate Jeremy and talked about the different party options we had for the night. I then showered dressed and headed out to the party.

I WAS FUCKING EARLY I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE THERE WHAT A LOSER but hey it was all good because my RA who was in Lamda Chi had his girlfriend and her friends there and Skinner and I spun some game to them. Well the part was BYOB which pissed me off but I bummed beer like crazy that night. I played flip cups with Alex's Girlfriend's friends and they supplied all the beer. I also bummed some beer off this kid who was in my economics class in the fall who always talked to my group but I had no idea what his name was. So while thourghly drunk I watched Cooper and Autuam play beer pong and I kept hoitting on Alex's girlfriend's frien I think her name was Alexia or something like that. Well we went out on the porch to get some fresh air DID I FUCKING MENTION IT IS COLD AS SHIT OUT THERE but hey she is from Maryland and I guess yankees are used to that kind of weather. I kept slipping on the icy poarch and I noticed my friend Dara was with that chick from the Real World Ruthie who came as a social event of the campus. I wasn' excited about Ruthie coming to Shepherd for the day but a lot of my friends were my ex Squires even stole one of the fucking Ruthie is coming signs. Well I talked to her and Dara just so I could brag about meeting a celebrity and then when I went in to get some more beer and Alexia or whatever her name was went to hang out with her firends again leaving Skinner who was talking to her other friend and me alone. Well I bummed some more Guiness off that Econ dude and laughed about old times of which I don't really remember him being involved in to much he was liket hat kid that looked like Jimmy Carter in that class he played a part in our converstaions but he wasn't a part of our conversations if you know what I mean. 

Well Skinner started dancing with Ruthie and the dumb ass didn't even know who the fuck she was and he wasn't even drunk since he was dd for the night. Well they danced and then I wond up talking to her some she kept asking me if I could get her alchol and I did (I had no idea she was a recovering alcholic I didn't watch that season of the Real World) well I danced with her and hung out with her some more and then I saw my boy Bill Bailey's sister. 

Bill Bailey's sister was pretty hot and I had hit on her at the highlighter party a few weeks before I wrote my number her t-shirt right were her boob was and she said she couldn't take it seriously if I wrote it on her boob so I wrote it on the belly part of the shirt but neither of us thought that yellow higlighter is hard to read on a white t-shirt with out black light. So I talked to her and she introduced me to her friend Lauren wel Lauren was really hot she reminded me of a Russian chick so I all talked to her. She told me how she was going to England for spring break and how she had a biology mid term. I was so drunk at this point I told her how it was awesome she like biology because I love the zoo and then I went into how much i love the bird house at the zoo and how if I could I would just hang out there all day and look at all the birds. She said that was cool. We talked for a while longer and she said she had to go study for a test but I talked her into staying for a while longer and then when I asked her if she wanted to go hang out somewhere more private she told me straight up. ""Your hot but your also very drunk and I have to go study for biology"". so she leftbut I got her sn. I then went and just hung out with random girls I then started talking with this chick from Delta Zeta who I was all in love with. She was always givign me women advice and she was very pretty even though she was thick and right before asking her if she wanted to go somewhere private the cops busted in. Well since I was only 19 at the time I placed my beer next to her leg didn't even say good bye and i and the rest of the underagers ran towards the back door. 

I reached it first though I was to drunk to figure out how to open it. Cassie and another of her Alpha Sigma Tao sisters opened the door and we ran out like water breaking through the Hoover Dam. I ran by two parked cop cars and then took off my upper shirt and wore my bunder shirt to try to make it look like i wasn't at the party. I ran into this wooded area next to the blue Moon Cafe and hid there hoping the cops wouldn't come there while I heard the cops caytching a lot of the others. I walked through the wooded area to avoid detecion but I ran into the fence were the damn ravine is from the town run at the same time I heard a train role across the bridge and I said fuck this so I ran out of the woods and ran to the front street at shepherd. then I ran behind the library on the back street, then i ran in front of the library on the front street, then i ran behind Ikenberry on the back street and then finally i snuck up into gardiner ahead of the cops who were chasing after me. I ran into my room and shut off all the lights Jeremy was sleeping on the floor again and the Cops never came upstairs to find me or anybody else I was sweating so bad even though it had been freazing outside and I had to throw up several times from the beer and the running but it was all awesome. I didn't sleep with anybody who was at the party but I did make my rounds with my regular that night who lived across campus she even drove over to pick me up i didn't have sex but I felt good about the night. 

The next day I went to my 9 o'clcok international relations class and listened to dr. Rhee talk about how much he hated Korea while I nursed a hangover. Then I went back to my room and hung out with Bob until he left at noon for spring break and then I hung out with Jeremy and talked  about how all black quarterbacks do is run and how michael Vick was a retard until my dad picked me up around 2 and took me to pick up my brother Sean at military school before we left for Myrtle Beach. My head was fine after the 3 blue power aids I drank on the way to Massanutan Military."

So I told her I was in the Guess jeans ad were the dude is making out with Paris Hilton and how Paris and I drank Absolute at a club called Absolute.

I also told her how I'm going to LA to film my new movie Flatlienrs II which she has heard of even though it doesn't exist. How awesome is that. This girl pisses me off though she talked crap about my friend and she bugs me all the time at church so she deseves it."

"event","so ok last quiz of the night. I was getting tired ofeveryone calling me a yankee because I'm the only person down here that calls soda soda every one in georgia calls it coke no matter if it is sprite or dr.pepper it is called coke. I also get crap for calling it a shopping cart everyone else calls them buggies so I took this quiz at this website 

http://www.sonicpling.net/misc/yankee-dixie-quiz.html and i got this for my score

49% (Yankee). Barely into the Yankee category.

I guess Virginia is pretty close to the north and I was traised by my mom and her family is from NY and Wisconsin which I guess explains why I use a lot of midwestern/great lakes region words. Plus I was born in Maryland which was a boarder state during the civil war but hey the important thing is if I had to fight in the Civil war I would have fought for Virginia in the Confederacy"

"event","Since September 11, 2001, Americans and Canadians have come together as never before in our generation. We have banded together to overcome tremendous adversity. We have weathered direct attacks on our own soil, wars overseas, corporate/government scandal, layoffs, unemployment, stock price plunges, droughts, fires, mad cow, SARS, high gasoline prices, and a myriad of economic and physical disasters both great and small. But now, we must come together once again to overcome our greatest challenge yet.

Hundreds of Professional Hockey players in our very own nation are going to be locked out, living at well below the seven-figure salary level.
And as if that weren't bad enough they could be deprived of their life giving pay for several months, possibly longer, as a result of the upcoming lockout situation. But you can help!

For only $20,835 a month, about $694.50 a day(that's less than the cost a large screen projection TV) you can help an NHL player remain economically viable during his time of need. Your contribution by no means solves the problem as it barely covers the annual minimum salary, but it's a start, and every little bit will help!

Although $700 may not seem like a lot of money to you, to a hockey player it could mean the difference between spending the lockout golfing in Florida or on a Mediterranean cruise. For you, seven hundred dollars is nothing more than a month's rent, half a mortgage payment, or a month of medical insurance, but to a hockey player, $700 will partially replace his daily salary.

Your commitment of less than $700 a day will enable a player to buy that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio.



HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING?

Each month, you will receive a complete financial report on the player you sponsor. Detailed information about his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. Plus, upon signing up for this program, you will receive an unsigned photo of the player lounging during the lockout on a beach somewhere in the Caribbean (for a signed photo, please include an additional $150). Put the photo on your refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering.


HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING?

Your NHL player will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need. Although the player won't know your name, he will be able to make collect calls to your home via a special operator in case additional funds are needed for unforeseen expenses.


YES, I WANT TO HELP!

I would like to sponsor a locked out NHL player. My preference is (check below):

( ) Forward ( ) Defenseman ( ) Goaltender ( ) Entire team

*Please call our 900 number to ask for the cost of a specific team - $10 per minute

( ) Jaromir Jagr (Higher cost: $32,000 per day)

Please charge the account listed below $694.50 per day for the duration of the lockout. Please send me a picture of the player I have sponsored, along with an Jaromir Jagr 2001 Income Statement and my very own Bob Goodenow (Executive Director of the NHLPA player's Union) pin to wear proudly on my hat (include $80 for hat).


Your Name: _

Account Number:

( ) MasterCard ( ) Visa ( ) American Express ( ) Other

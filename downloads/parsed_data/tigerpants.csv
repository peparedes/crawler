"event","well this is going to be a long and very disjointed update as>im such on a high at the moment and iv'e also had some lovely red wine The past three days have changed me and aimees life forever. From the beginning we got there on thursday to the gig! aimee brought a ticket which was a seating one:( as standing was sold out me and monique were right up the front, polly came on and oh my god i think i lost it! like nothing else meant a thing except for little polly up there, anyhow she had her lovely animal muppet dress on! and her hot cowboy boots on which she even attempted todo a half split in them when she was turning of her effects peddle she was so close i could squeeze her! she opened with 50ft queenie which is always good. The show was amazing i can't put it too words how she touched me:(! like right now i feel all emo and yeah why did this have to end haha:( when she played mejane and thegarden I DIED!..i kept looking back at aimee thinking why aren't you here! she finished with mejane which left me wanting more and more, i hung around the stage a bit and i got her guitar pick and josh came out and gave me the setlist. 

After the show we met some fans who were lovely we met a boy called shane and he was from new zealand believe it or not and was following the nsw, vic and qld shows.! We hung around a bit me and aimee had a 10 minute conversation with dingo he is fucking lovely we then went out the back for quite a while and the security guard was getting annoyed so he took me and aimee backstage so we would believe she had left the building! lol, i stole her dressing room sign and another page with itinerary and stuff on it the tour manager and some crew were just left, anyhow we went back to the hotel she was not there so we went to the japanese karaoke bar next door as backstage they said she was doing karaoke and while we were in there we asked and they were like some  english people were in room 3 and we heard a voice that sounded like polly singing blondie and we were like WHAT?! we kept like peeping in the door and finally all these drunken people opened the door we explained ourselves and they were like POLLYHARVEY I WISH!:( it was alot of fun. We got back to my mums around 3am and on the bus home i kept thinking about the whole night in shock.

The  next day we got to the enmore a few hours before, we met up with shane and this lovely girl called florencia who was sat next to aimee the night before and she is a photographer for brag she made me laugh a lot god shes great! as mon would say. Anyhow we got in and well since me and aimee were together it was amazing, she played alot of new songs first then she hit the old ones she PLAYED plantsandrage we were like going so mental and she started to pay attention to us... she has defintaly matured as a perfomer over the years anyhow we kept going mental and she looked at us more how could you not:D when she played down by the water she laughed at us when she sang the line ""whore"" as we would not shut up! we were distracting her and at the end of down bye the water she rub her tummy at us and like kind of poked her tongue out>even mon saw this, then mejane came on and we couldn't believe that this was happening to us and she kept smiling at us wowow we died over & over. The show was amazing and she played the drums in my beautiful leah she ended with is this desire and it was all very emotional she said her thank yous which left us screaming for more she looked at us again:d and she appreciated our love no really she did.

So we left the concert and went to the hotel she arrived and was so shattered that she couldn't talk to us but we had a chat with dingo and got a photo he is amazing! Then florencia and monique went up to the bar upstairs and they were drinking with josh and dingo and the tour managers:( i was like so upset lol because me and aimee were waiting for them downstairs and we had no idea:/ and josh was like to monique "" oh were you guys all in the front row"" dammit i missed out on this! after that we went to oxford had vege nachos at 3am we made our way to elizabeth street had 4 hours sleep and all shared a bed at the backpackers. Then the next morning we met polly and it was amazing i only got 5 cds signed has my friend has is this desire, i left DHALP at home and i already had stories, We asked her if she had got the letter we gave to her roadie phil and she was concerned about it!, she also said about her acoustic gig on the 11th she asked if we were going!!!!!!!!we need togo somehow....ideas anyone. I really would have liked to be at the brisbane concert right now thats really all i can think of now~! im going to think of more when im sober! here are some photos

"event","so the written by hand journal isnt really working out... im just not good at writing anymore... i think it has a lot to do with just the modern world that were are conditioned to... its like people in the 18th century writting by candlite probably thought the same thing about carving in stone or something.  I think i might actually make a journal out of this... not for anyone inparticularly... just write some thoughts down... my day... whatever... no one will read it... except brittany i guess... i dont really have anything to say to her anymore... ive ran out of ways to communicate how sorry i am that i broke things off with her... i guess she can read this still if she wants... but im just going to talk about me i guess...

today... was amazing...

snake turned 21 last night... that makes the whole apt 21 now... we went downtown to celebrate with him... wow... so much fun.  yes i had a few beers for the first time in a while but it still fun and i feel like i really bonded with snake and hallit more than i ever have before.  I had to take care of the kid later in the night anyway... he threw up from all the random shots kids kept buying him.  when we woke up my friend andrew taylor, tink,  hallit, mays, snake, davy, ross, jitters, and laura were all awake and hanging out in our living room.  juice came over and we all hung out till about noon or so and then me and juice went to chill and get some food.  afterward i went to the baseball game with hallit, ryan, and dave.  at about 3 oclock i we met up with about 20 otehr guys at the intra fields and played sandlot baseball... i hit two monster homeruns and everyone kept joking that i was on steriods... the were seriously such bombs... one probably rolled 550 feet before it stoped.  came home after that and we had family dinner.  about 10 of snakes closest friends were there and we all grilled chicken, turkey burgers, steaks, fish, and veggies, ocra, and rice and had a feast.  it was really good and then we all ate snakes cake which was killer.  i really love my friends and the community that im sharing with them.  everyday we have fun and laugh and relax around each other.  im really excited to be graduating next semester... 6 months before all my friends, and im going to miss them so much but it will be worth it.  anyway, after dinner came home and watched braves beat the nats till about midnight and then just dicked around with some hw... 

ok... so in the course of writting this i realized how lame this is and probably wont ever do it again hahaha... its like the play by play of my day... 8 more days of school... stoked on summer... peace"

"event","then i would say you never did in the first place.  i dont see how you stop believing... i know sometimes we stop acting like it... but i dont think we stop believing in Him.... I have found that for me a lot of how i act about Jesus is directly related to who ive been hanging out with on a regular basis.  i never didnt believe in God but the more i hung out with non christians the more i dont act like it... my friend douger says that the more we run with the dogs the more fleas we get.... he says it jokingly but i think theres a lot of truth in that statement.  there is purpose in fellowship."

"event","wow.... what a great easter! I'm amazed at how loving people can be.  Me and some friends went to this church in roenoke today, about 45 mins away.  We had heard through the grape vine that it was a really sweet deal and so we went to check it out.  THere were about 10 of us in all and as soon as we walked through the doors we could feel the love of Christ pouring out on us.  It wasnt a very big church, about 150-200 in all and we were the only visiters, even on easter sunday.  everyone wanted to meet us so bad.  ive never shaken so many hands and been greated by so many loving people in my life.  after the service all the people like just flocked to us and wanted to know everything about our lives... i couldnt even pee in the bathroom without the guy in the stale next to me asking how i was and how my day was going and how school was and everything... it was amazing.  they insisted that we all come out to this one families house, another 30 min away, and have easter dinner with some of the families.   we were so happy and excited about our new friends that we jumped in their cars with their families and kids and drove all the way out to this family's house and hung out all day long.  there were about 5 or 6 families with children in middle school and younger and about 4 other young couples a few years older than us and they all were so happy that we came that they went out of their way to make us comfortable and happy... we played volleyball in our suits and ties and played with the dogs and rolled int he grass with the kids and just talked about Jesus and love and people and wow... it felt so great, like nothing ive ever experienced.  here we were, 10 college dudes, only 3 of which i even knew before today, and 4 who werent even christians at all, being comepletely flooded by christs love through these people.  we ate and ate and talked and talked and spent the entire afternoon just basking in the sun and sharing in the beauty of christ's love.  It really challanged me in the way i act towards my roomates and my friends at college... i want to serve them the way i was served today.  i want to show christ;s love to them the way it was shown to me through these families.  its so funny how such a small thing like showing compelte and honest interest in people can communicate Jesus's beautiful death and resurrection more than any sermon or any song..."

to sick of cold tips

bring on the skirt tales and secretary chases

hotels full of societies abraisions
and we're still sleeping without sheets

her knuckles are on someone elses door

so hold on tight and stop the presses
meet in the middle but not to close
it's getting harder to sort out soccer practice

hotel doormen on first name basis

pick sailors off of sinking vessels and sleeping shipwrecks 
economy is down like the captian holding hard to rutter landmines
 and i find its hard to look back without cries for ""whats mine!""  
tell me darling why i never hear your voice over rising waters and rowing boats? 
throw me a bridge! let me cross this moat,  
and i promise to set sail with one thousand men to conquer this battlefront"

if you ad this to your chance of winning
you'll find the answers are less than perfect
if you subtract your willingness to forgive
the problems are self inflicted train wrecks

trouble is you're no good at calculus
so stop dividing and subtracting numbers
in circles you are empty running
horses without saddle burrs

affect your heart with infectious diseases
the effects will blow your mind
its easier to errect your own body
then to sit, and be left behind 

so stick the needle in and pull the trigger
input some love or export some distaste
for the blackness you find inside us
can multiply and overtake"

any lips that easily spill
i find it easy to hold accountable 
everything that holds my heart

find it here but lose it elsewhere
your virgin ears with lovers words
find new ways to consumate urges
and harder way to congegate verbs"

"event","when strength gives way to sissors
and heavenly men become modest
skies weight heavy with eternity
the tissue hearts become honest

your answers are celestial
but the sun will burn your eyes
find rest in the questions
that heaven tries to hide

with caskets on shoulders
angels mock mortality
but they will never feel
blood dripping from the knees

shave our heads with lust
dont deny my final urges
ill trade this eternity
when sheet and body merges"

and worst enemies with pillows and blankets
its alot easier to make tv guide decisions
than closing our eyes just to fake it

Five AM kitchen coffee conversations 
are knives in shoulders and lies to faces
lunch break romance beats masterbation
bring on the skirt tales and secretary chases

City blocks with concrete foundations
and we're still sleeping in the streets
hotels full of societies abraisions
and we're still sleeping without sheets

Gentlemen with ties, holding paychecks
but his pants are on someone elses floor
Instead of one-way domestic trainwrecks
her knuckles are on someone elses door"

"event","It was an breezy sunday afternoon and the high rises ran their fingers through the clouds like a young girl searching for summerflowers in an overgrown field.  I could tell it was sunday because the park was full of middle aged business women in full jogging gear and half distracted coat and ties walking their dogs.  If it had been monday I would of seen four or five children on the monkey bars or a retired couple strolling slowly by the dried up creek bed.  From my vantage point I could see the the Ohio river sweeping its way around the city, unnoticed and unappreciated.  The houses that were scattered unevenly on the steep incline across the water had started to glow in the faint light as pick up football games gave way to kitchen lights and burning fireplaces.  October had crept up on Pittsburg faster than I was used to but nothing could compare to the way I felt standing on the river bank watching people jog up and down keeping time with the current's flow."

"event","""I'm swimming with the sharks, mouth full of razorblades.""  

That phrase changed my life.  I heard it while trying to convince my legs to move infront of the other in some sort of combination of forward motion.  Fall brought my life to a stand still and I wasn't quite sure what I was doing here.  Shit was seperated.  My feelings couldn't be hurt because my stomach was no longer connected to my ears and my moral couldn't be improved because my motiviation wasnt connected to my  feelings.  There was growing urgency inside my brain to find something.  It didn't neccessarily have to be a holy grail but something none the less.  I figure everyone reaches a point in their lives where they are searching in dark allys for green lights or ocean floors for space ships.   It has to do alot with where you are looking but it has even more to do with who is looking and I was swimming in an ocean of sharks with a mouth full of dull, rusty, razorblades."

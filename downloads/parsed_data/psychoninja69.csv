"event","Here we are, another dreary day has passed. The darkness in my life growing mile, by mile. The pain seeping through me like a drug. The anger rising like the morning sun- and frozen over by my dark thoughts. Why do I feel so negative? Life has treated me poorly, but their are better things awaiting me in the future..... I feel that I have come to the last of my misery...the only way to survive....is to let go of it all......



                  I'm Letting Go......."

"event","They think i'll forget all the nasty things they said.
                   BUT I WON'T
They think I'll give them another chance...
                   BUT I WON'T
They think I'll be ok and i'll forgive and forget what was said..
                   BUT I WON'T
They think that when its my time to go, I'll say goodbye...

"event","I regret to inform you that im too far away for good bye.
They thought they knew me well enough to know that I wasn't happy. They thought it was just a phase...
But they didn't see how far my scars truly ran..
They thought they cared. But mom and Dad you seemed to forgot about caring when you were screaming at eachother, with a young child in the next room.

So it's time to say, my friends that this is the end....
But I won't say it...
Because i'm too far away to say ....

GOODBYE"

"event","Well when I was little....I had a bad experience......High school kids did bad things to me....But as I look back on it now, I ask myself why Am I just now dealing with it? Mostly because I hear about other people who have gone through the same thing I did and I understand where they're coming from. I used to be scared that if I told, they woyld hurt me. But now I REFUSE to let them get to me. what's even more sad, is that I do not remember their names. They were seniors, but I can't remember their names. I remember their faces, because I used to wake up in the middle of the night scared because I was afraid. They haunted my dreamsm forthe longest time, but now it's just too unbearable."

"event","Hey all.. today was cool i suppose. all has been good lately. 
Didnt get into an argument with my mom last night either, yes. scoreness.
Right now i am listening to that one song on dc 101 called ""so cold"" yeah. it's a good song. whootie WhHoo. TODAY i saw Jimmy. Because he was behind my bus and when i go off, he pulled over and we talked for a minute and then we departed But that has been the best minute that i'v had for a while. 
I watched ACC's today and yesterday. and im so depressed. I miss it so much. I dont know.. i would be better if i didnt know we're suppose to go to florida neXt year for MB and i want to be apart of that. So i gotta get my act together on this bass business or i will have to guard again. And i dont want to have to deal with leaora again..I mean i do believe she hates me .I wish she didnt . Mr Dye hates me too. I want them to like me again, and to just call me Bam and be best friends again. I am going to write a letter to Mr.Dye the first day of Chorus .. which is coming up soon. and im nervous. im scared that he is going to hate me and ignore me and do those things that he does.. 
I can't let this bother me like it does. it does. so much. it's weird. 
I need to get my act together and i need to kno that i have a chance next year.
Anyway besides that business. today was coo.. i allready said that tho. haha.I got to see jimmy. you know that. i got to see him. i got to see him! i got to SEE HIM!..eeee
>.< ^.^ :D (: (: (: (: :D :D :D >.< .
I hugged him and enjoyed it, i just held on tight. i didnt wanna let go. 

i love you.

-forever_

i have so much to do. atleast i feel like i should. i need to do homework, i want to take a shower and clean my room. then make something to eat... oh no, wait, i have that yummy shit my mom made last night.. mmm

"event","Hey!..I'm sooo good right now. I'm grounded.But who cares. Life is good. . this journal entry is to remind me how good my life is.  I got my computer, friends, and jimmy. What the fuck else do i need? AND christmas is fuckin comin ya'll! .. werd, my friends.Werd.
Let me hear ya shout, hahaha..And i got music and everytime i turn the radio on im like, ..ahh..I totaly forget about all my problems.It's so great. I <3 music.it's the cure to all problems. Do you not forget all your problems when you're concentrating on scoring every word to your favorite song that comes on the radio? I do, and it rocks.
When i want to stroll down memory lane i listen to brandnew because it reminds me of evrything seductive, alcoholic, and sexy. =Jimmy. it's fuckin great. 
I'm listening to MyGoodies which is a kickass song. Oooh,Oohh,OoH ::AAHH:: (;
It changed ):.. oh well the next song will be great, too. unless it's that one bitch.
Oooh ryan cabrara!..Mmm, he's good.Everything is so good right now.I feel so good. All the parts, all the thoughts, all the blinks..perfect-o (: ..I feel so perfect
I kno, im not. But right now, im in an escaping-bubble, and it rocks. I want to stay here ::cuddles on side of bubble:: Mmm, wake me when..
Radio changed. and i adore this song. Over & Over by Nelly and Tim mcGraw <3 <3
I'v been feeling so good lately.  I think it's a part of talking to Chantell again. I'v missed her so much and i forgot how much i loved her.She's so great. I admire her for the fact that she doesnt care what people think when shes decked with glitter on hand and black on the other and says ""for real, daaamn"" and ""man, i'd love to see them in concert,\M/"" in the same sentence. She's so great. and when people give her shit .. she doesnt take it. I think me n her are the only ones in our stupid ass school(besides kt and that one chickiepoo from latin) who would ever dare do that. Idon't care. people can cuss me out till the cows come home, they're all dumb as hell, son. rock on. 
~ i <3 chany ~


Okay, this song stands for me. Numb-Encore. Deffinatly. __what the hell are you waiting fooo-ooor!?__ i mean, it's the best. rap & rock all in one. 
That song, and The one by trick daddy with the CrazyTrain. yes.. 
Yep. \m/ & east side. Lp <3 <3 <3 ahh
This reminds me. I miss Erin like HELL. havnt seen her since warped. argh.. omg, that day was sooo much fun.Without-a-doubt.. the best damn day of this chickie's life.

--can i get an encore--
am i spelling encore, right> heh.. dont care.

Allright, this song i cannot stand. *changes* and it is..::drumrole:: Ooooh!!! EEEE!!
""lose my breath"" by destinys child.This is such a kickass song. 
It's over.

Oh now, it's that one song ""what they gon do!?"" with lil jon *duno the name*
WE GETTING CRUNK IN HURRRRR

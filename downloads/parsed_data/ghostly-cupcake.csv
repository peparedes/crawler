"event","New Year's Predictions time!

To recap, let's see how I did the past year: 

1) Another friend of mine will grow a beard. [Brendan attempted briefly, and now Jeff has started cultivating mutton-chops. That almost counts.]
2) Yet again, by the end of the year, I would have done something I've told myself before I'm not going to do. [Hmmm...]
3) A big secret will be spilled, either by myself to someone, or someone to me. [No.]
4) By the end of 2007, I would have not only been to at least 20 shows, but a new band will work its way into my top ten favorites. (It's a pretty sweet spot to be, lemme tell ya) [1/2 correct. I went to maybe 10 shows (Very lame) but I think Crime In Stereo counts as one of my new permanent favorites.]
5) One of my Denison friends will find someone special but break up with them before the end of the year. [Brendan and his ex; Mike and his ex. Double win but I'll count it as one.]
6) One of my Westerville friends will go out with someone they've really wanted to. [Dave said the new girl he is going out with is someone he has been wanting to go out with for a while, so yes.]
7) I'll make an incredible new friend by the end of the year. [I made at least six in Chicago!]
8) My dear friend Brian will finally show interest in another girl. (Thieved from David, because fuck, it better come true) [No!!!]
9) By the end of the year, I would have finally finished another screenplay, extended short story, or book. (Because it didn't work last time) [No!!!]
10) This'll be the year I'll fall in love again. [I think that is fair to say.]

Hm... so 6.5/10. Not bad, but not as good as 2007's 8/10 either.

2007 Prediction Sidenotes:
1) I calculated Brian's correct amount of 2007 predictions: 5/9, and with the guess that I would have more than him, 6/10 (This is some kind of cheating!).
2) I unofficially predicted/swore to Elia that I would be published three more times (after my summer internships) before the end of the year, and even thought 2007 is over, I have THREE segments I wrote in the upcoming issue of the newspaper of my current internship, and considering that I finished two of the three assignments before the calendar change, that's half-right.

And now... *ahem*... time for the OFFICIAL REYAN PREDICTIONS FOR THE YEAR OF OUR LORD TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT...

1) One of my friends will be incredibly successful in the job market this year.
2) Brian will FINALLY like someone else. (I am going to keep doing this one until it works)
3) I will get back into touch with an old friend and start communicating with them a lot more than before.
4) I am going to do something I haven't done in a long time.
5) I will move into an incredible new apartment, and be content with my excellent new roommate.
6) There will be a marriage/engagement announcement from someone who is at or was at Denison.
7) Graduation will be more happy than sad.
8) I will finally see a band that I've always to but never had the chance before.
9) I will have been published 10 times (in varying forms) before the end of the year.
10) There will be one big break-up.

HAPPY 2008!"

"event","Day Two of my second internship. Both will be abnormally short (In total, it will probably be only 3 weeks of work) because of my visit to Pakistan, but the travel arrangements had been made a long time ago, so what's done is done. It's kind of unfortunate that I didn't get an earlier start, but when you have to deal with red tape and delayed meetings and cancellations and what-not, you take what you can get.

I'm not made for the corporate world. I like this place, yeah (It's one of Pakistan's lead law-firms, and we have big clients. I am currently researching stuff for a case where $15 million will be spent), but I doubt I have the scruples or corporate confidence for this kind of business. Plus you need to know a lot of legal jargon, and that bores the hell out of me. But who knows. I can adapt.

The more I think about it, the more I'm likely to end up a high school teacher for a little while (At least a few years). I need something that pays the bills. I don't really enjoy journalism that much (last I checked). Maybe I should give it another shot. I don't know.

It seems like so many people around me have structured ideas for the future, and I'm kind of clinging to this thin skeleton of possibilities with a very limp grip. I figure I'll have to go to grad school, and that means getting out of Ohio for a little while. My family were all quite disappointed I never applied for an Ivy League school (Oh, those high Pakistani standards), so maybe this time I will up the ante and apply for something with name value. I'm a pretty intelligent guy, I bet I could do it. And out of anywhere in the United States aside from Ohio I'd want to live in, my first choice would probably be Washington. Weird how Elia came from the DC/VA area to OH, and now I'm thinking about maybe ending up there myself. But it's all just thoughts, you know?
 
Knowing what you want to do for your life and knowing how to get there are two very different things."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Well, he got re-elected, and now America is paying the price"">I recall, only a few months ago, the horrific plight of a brain-dead woman in Florida. Her feeding tube had been removed, and both the Congress and the President came in, at night, on a Sunday, to pass and sign into law a bill just for her benefit. For one single person, they were able to meet and work. And yet, it took five days for both Congress and the President to come into session to provide relief funding to the people of New Orleans, and the other areas devestated by Hurricane Katrina. I am disappointed in my Representatives and Senators, and in the President, for not moving on this immediately. Why did it take so long, when thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of lives were and still are at stake?

While people were dying, the President was making speeches, and playing with an accoustic guitar in San Diego. While New Orleans flooded, Secretary Rice was spending a few thousand dollars on shoes in New York. The Department of Homeland Security (which includes FEMA) has supposedly been preparing for just such a disaster for four years, and somehow completely failed us here. Katrina even gave us a warning; terrorists usually don't. Can we trust them to handle a terrorist attack, when they couldn't handle this disaster? FEMA didn't even know about the thousands at the New Orleans convention center until yesterday.

The city of New Orleans, the state of Louisiana, and the Army Corps of Engineers had warned for years that the levee system was not adequate to protect the city from a storm like Katrina. And yet evidence has come out that the Bush administration has steadily cut funding to the Corps' levee projects, in order to fund the Iraq war and Homeland Security. Even after the scare from Hurricane Ivan last year, the budget was cut yet again. Not to mention that the war has taken both National Guard personnel and equipment that was desperately needed in the hurricane areas. Perhaps this is the reason it took five days for sufficient Guardsmen to come to New Orleans and begin to restore order and distribute food and water?

Of course, having known about this threat for years, New Orleans and Louisiana officials should have been better prepared for this eventuality as well. Their evacuation plan relied heavily on people having their own transportation out of the city, and thousands of poor, sick, disabled, and elderly people who couldn't leave or make it to shelter were left in their homes. The Superdome and convention center were obviously not properly prepared to house all the evacuees and maintain order.

August 29, 2005, is a day that will far outstrip September 11, 2001, in all ways. Deaths, costs, and economic impact will all be much, much higher. Remember 9/11, and remember how it has been used to justify many things that were supposedly for our benefit. Then remember 8/29, and remember how all those things failed us.

* * *

In September 1999, Hurricane Floyd -- a category 3 -- was bearing down the
Carolinas and Virginia.

President Clinton was in Christchurch, New Zealand - meeting with President
Jiang of China (you know, actually working). He made the proclamation that
only Presidents can make and declared the areas affected by Floyd ""Federal
Disaster Areas"" so the National Guard and Military can begin to mobilize. Then he cut short his meetings overseas and flew home to coordinate the rescue efforts. This all one day BEFORE a Cat-3 hit the coast. That is how you do it.

How about this dope's own father during Hurricane Andrew? Once again,
President Bush (41) -- August, 1992 -- was in the midst of a brutal campaign
for re-election. Yet, he cut off his campaigning the day before and went to
Washington where he martialed the largest military operation on US soil in
history. He sent in 7,000 National Guard and 22,000 regular military
personnel, and all the gear to begin the clean up within hours after Andrew
passed through Florida. 'Cause, you know, those people and their stuff was
actually where it belonged, rather than being used for insurgent
target-practice halfway around the world in a vain effort to make Iraq safe
for Iranian takeover.


In August of 1969 when Cat-5 Hurricane Camille hit roughly the same area as
Katrina, President Nixon had already readied the National Guard and ordered
all Gulf rescue vessels and equipment from Tampa and Houston to follow the
Hurricane in. There were over 1,000 regular military with two dozen
helicopters to assist the Coast Guard and National Guard within hours after
the skies cleared.

Bush 43 - August 2005 - Cat-5 Hurricane Katrina bears down on New Orleans
and the Mississippi gulf. Both states are down nearly 8,000 National Guard
troops because they are in Iraq -- with most of the rescue gear needed. Bush
is on vacation. The day before Katrina makes landfall, Bush rides his bike
for two hours. The day she hits, he goes to Johnnie McCain's birthday party;
and lies to old people about the multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical company
welfare boondoggle. People are dying, the largest port of entry in the
United States (and fifth largest in the World) is under attack. Troops and
supplies are desperately needed. The levees are cracking and the emergency
1-1/2 ton sandbags are ready, but there aren't enough helicopters or pilots
to set them before the levees fail. The mayor of New Orleans begs for
Federal coordination, but there is none, and the sandbagging never gets
done. So Bush -- naturally -- goes to San Diego to play guitar with country
singer and lie to the military about how Iraq is just exactly like WWII. The
levees give way, filling New Orleans with water, sewage, oil and chemicals.
Ten percent of all US exports, and 50% of all agricultural exports ordinarly
go through this port. It is totally destroyed. Bush decides he'll end his
vacation a couple of days early -- TOMORROW --BECAUSE HE HAS TICKETS TO A
PADRES GAME! He goes back to the Fake Farm in Crawford, with every intention
of doing something on WEDNESDAY about this disaster that happened starting
last Sunday night.

If you're bored, you can easily waste some time reading what other people think about the teachers. So, now it's time to give that one teacher the rating he/she deserves.

This edition: awesome album covers. My favorite album covers, anyways.

(This isn't about the albums themselves... just the pretty pictures on the front)

<lj-cut text=""Ooh, look at all the preeety pictures!""> 

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000002P22.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""40 Oz To Freedom"" by Sublime</b>

This image is on, what, 500 billion T-shirts, patches and stickers, but for good reason. It's such a trippy image. I have scene in my unfinished screenplay ""4/20"" where two smoked-up guys discuss any hidden images they can see it. ""IT'S A BONG, DUDE!!!""

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000000OFD.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Destruction by Definition"" by The Suicide Machines</b>

Alright, you can see a little asscrack, but so what? The Suicide Machines have created one of the defining images of the punk atmosphere and attitude (for me anyway) with this upbeat and adrenaline-rushed cover.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00008GQVU.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Sing The Sorrow"" by AFI</b>

Simple, poetic, understated. I wasn't a big fan of the old comic book-ish illustrations. It gets the job done without any clutter. Brilliant work.

<p align=center><img src=""http://homepages.enterprise.net/sevenball/dogzuki/images/stifflittlefingers.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Go For It"" by Stiff Little Fingers</b>

This is my current uJ icon, mainly because it's just one of those images that grabs you a mile away. It creates a great of tension, but it's quite a contrast to the album's actual comforting and care-free music.

<p align=center><img src=""http://www.theunlovables.com/images/UNLOVcover.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Punk Rock Club EP"" by The Unlovables</b>

I highly doubt anyone but Bizzy may have heard of this band, but it's just a really great, cute as hell image. Everyone with their All-Stars, standing around talking. I love it!

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000000JO3.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
""><p align=/center>

<b>""Complete Discography"" by Minor Threat</b>

Ian McKaye and Minor Threat started a straight-edge revolution with this album, and the dark, ominous red on the cover coupled with the almost saturated blacks makes this a rather sad and lonely image. It stands out a mile away.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000001IQH.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""...And Out Come The Wolves"" by Rancid</b>

Look familiar? This album has one of the best titles ever (at least for a punk album), and it's both a great tribute to Minor Threat, but with a fitting mohawk to the figure.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0000DIC87.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Splinter"" by The Offspring</b>

Call me biased, but I love this cover more than you know. It's a signature to breaking away old stereotypes and ""splintering"" off. Plus, it's cool as hell. The inside cover shows the bust falling apart even more, and the back has a flower where the neck used to be, with a rat crawling down the remains. Great stuff.

<p align=center><img src=""http://kaspunkskate.free.fr/Mad%20Caddies/Mad_Caddies_-_The_Holiday_Has_Been_Cancelled-front.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""The Holiday Has Been Cancelled"" by The Mad Caddies</b>

Sorry about the huge size, but this is one of those great images you don't know whether to laugh at or cry at. The 70's surfer edge added to it only makes the juxtaposition more hilarious. I should listen to the Caddies more.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00005QW0B.01._PE_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Give 'Em The Boot Vol. 3"" by Various Artists</b>

It's a simple but commanding image. There's nothing like someone's boot to make you want to listen to violent music. Hehe

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00001QENU.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""The Distance to Here"" by Live</b>

Just for Jeff! :D It's sooo trippy... oooh...

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000005EMY.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Mommy's Little Monster"" by Social Distortion</b>

It's natural to wonder just what the hell is going on here, but that doesn't mean you're any closer to figuring it out.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000002G7C.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Velvet Underground & Nico"" by Velvet Underground</b>

It's just a banana, right? What's so special about that you say? It's by Andy Warhol! And it's a removable sticker!

A STICKER BY ANDY WARHOL! Do I need to explain any more?
<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00009ATKP.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""A Match & Some Gasoline"" by The Suicide Machines</b>

Now we're talking. This is my current LJ icon, and plus, it's just a great iconic collection of images. The art is spectacular, and the merging of a gasmask with the Capitol building is just plain old genius. It fits The Machines' new political skew on music.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000060MMI.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Drunken Lullabies"" by Flogging Molly</b>

Not just because of St. Patrick's Day. This photograph is nostalgic, mournful, sullen and pure. I also happen to love pictures of people walking away.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00004BZ0N.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""London Calling"" by The Clash</b>

One of the very first places you saw the ravage spirit of oldschool punk coming through in the form of destroying instruments. The font is quite off for the subject matter (don't use balloon lettering if you're discontent), but the image is classic.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00005JGAF.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Rocket To Russia"" by The Ramones</b>

A great disheleved, almost B&W cover. I mentioned this in my Little Pieces story. It's sorta like the original Ramones cover, just from a different angle. But what's with the pink text?

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00008BNUU.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Destination: Beautiful"" by Mae</b>

So optimistic, artistic and organic. The colors are wonderful.

AND THE BEST ALBUM COVER OF ALL!













WAIT!










HERE IT COMES!












ARE YOU READY?










OK.

<p align=center><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00009NRW6.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg""><p align=/center>

<b>""Zombies In, Robots Out"" by The 14 Year-Old Girls</b>

No explanation needed.

***I must add ""Answer That And Stay Fashionable"" by AFI as well."

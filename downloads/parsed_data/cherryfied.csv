"event","walking around downtown Atlanta made me realize what a ""small town girl"" I was. I think the only time I've seen bigger buildings was in NYC and I don't even remember it that much. Being above all that underground stuff gives you a weird feeling too of being elevated, because well...you are. I saw a dead bird! and lots of homeless people, sure we have homeless people in Athens but they don't sleep in the doorways of stores here... which makes me wonder where they <i>do</i> go hmmm... I should really be more active in my community or some such thing. After the concert we could hear the city actually humming <small>or maybe it was that volvo next to us</small>. yup.

I stayed home from school today because I would be dead otherwise, ugh. tired...

The Washington Social Club was next, they were so fucking funny and good. The bassist was so cute, she jumped around all over the stage. I bought their cd and later on we got the singer to sign it &hearts; and then..... Hot Hot Heat came on.

Ahhhh! They are so so soooo good live. Steve is so funny and cute, wearing alligator boots! ha haa!

I love that lyric, it feels like it fits and it just feels so right. Like it's something complete. I do this with music too often, I find a good song and I listen to it so much that it looses that specialness but I don't have that cd, so I can't. the end. Feeling complete must be the best feeling in the world. What would it feel like to be finished? I think that's what it must feel like for people who have accapted death. Some people go kicking and screaming with blood in their eyes and I hope that it won't happen that way to me, though if I died now that would probably be the case.

Mom bought me a Dickie's dress, it's so awesome. The only problem is it's too big! I don't have a clue as what to do exactly. Return it? Maybe if I iron it... I sortof washed it hoping it would shrink. <small>dummy.</small> I feel so geeky. Aprons make me hot, it's true! I'm giddy over work uniforms!

I'm having an itch to bleach my hair and dye it red again, and with good hair dye not ghetto hairdye

ebay should die because it seems I can never find anything good anymore, maybe I'm not looking hard enough or maybe it's a <i>sign</i>

anyways, ass... I have the coolest underwear collection ever and black eyeliner and green tea. fuck you. raaaah."

I never have any energy which is okay when I feel nice and floaty but mostly I just feel tired. But I actually went to the library today (shit i have a $8 fine) and to Wal-mart and I bought myself a big fucking chocolate bunny. 

I had something to say and now I don't. But. Something's going to happen soon, I can feel it. Life's too much in a rut and is running too smoothly. It's pretty morbid but when I got up today I thought about how noone has died around me lately and I feel sortof scared. 

I just need someone or something, I don't know what."

My computer's starting to scare me, I keep getting all these ""error!"" pop up things. Please, please, please, please don't die on me!

I spent most of the weekend at home, it was nice. When you spend alot of time running from point A to point B you forget how really nice it is to just come home. I actually drew a self-portrait! Wow. It's pretty decent too, nevermind the fact that it's on the back of a Proactive box.... 

<center>-------Lost & Found-------
I've discovered a number of things I've lost, my Tool ""Lateralus"" cd, Bjork shirt, my black hooded shirt. If anyone has any idea where this stuff is could you please call me? I have about 4 boxes of corn dogs in my freezer that belong to somebody! Any ideas as to whose corn dogs are currently taking residence in my freezer? </center> 

It was so bright today, going grocery shopping. I spent every minute outside squinting. Oh, and Nerds Ropes are as nasty as fuck. 

Aol I hate you so very, very much.

I wish I had cd burning capacities but then I'd probably just burn a bunch of ones that would make me cry. I wish I could play piano like this. I think I'm getting carple tunnel in my right hand...  errrr I really want to see them when they come to Gwinette but I don't think I'll have nearly enough money + possibly noone else to go with :O  

I got red & white yarn for a scarf for me...and now it's getting warm. Heh, I could always be like Allie and wear scarves in the summer. Knitting at one in the morning...I drink too much caffine.

"event","I bought Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head, ooh my I am in love with this cd... and sage insense. I feel super peaceful and what's really weird is that I've felt really pretty lately too. Usually I feel awful about how I look even though I have nothing to complain about, it's just weird. I'm just not happy but lately I have been. I feel like I've been getting out of this stupid funk I've been in. I'm happier, it's like I can breathe again (even if my asthma is getting worse). 

School's going pretty great...not at all like I'd expected though. I feel like I'm soaring through psychology- it's really interesting. English...oh my English...I'm afraid I'm going to fail that class, it is the most boring experience of my life. I think I'm going to melt into a puddle at any given moment, there's so much stupid! Apparently seniors in highschool are at the reading level of a two-year old that's been beaten with a hammer. Okay, now I feel really bad saying that (about the fictional toddler) but I digress... I'm bored. I sew in Algebra but I'd better stop because if my grades don't get better I might fail and I need that credit.

I'm re-concidering moving to Florida when I graduate... I love the warm weather but I hate storms. Maybe I'll just stay in Georgia, I can deal with the one or two odd months of cold. Winter just makes me depressed, the past couple days have been clearer and warmer and I feel much happier."

On the drive home Meagan saw daffodils so we parked the car and got out to pick some, on the way back we found a red hot chili peppers cd o_o;; it works too. kinda. I thought I was gonna die laughing. Didn't want to go home so we went and bugged Sam! He thought we were on drugs because we kept giggling the whole time. Me and Meagan haven't hung out in soooooo long. Yay, making me happy. me and Daddy time. woo woo. then I came home and knitted and had soup! yay! the end.

I almost feel like I used to before...whatever the hell it is that's making me feel so nervous lately. 

Never, ever, let me into a Wal-Mart with more than a dollar. I go crazy. I almost bought lady bug buttons today....I plan on going back to get them, and plain green fabric...I'm making a lady bug skirt. I got some more tulle to finish my black skirt, unbleached muslin to start on that doll, ribbons...and a pillowcase on sale to make a pillowcase skirt with. skirt! spork! and pink paint to paint my wooden bead necklace. I've decided to make some of my own plugs in ceramics (drawing & painting 2, whatever) meep, should be fun.

The past few days have been very productive, adventerous and frustrating all at the same time.  Friday the 13th sucks! I had an awful dream, then was late for work, then hit a deer on the way home from work. There goes my money! I called the cops and they came out and wrote me a report for it so maybe my insurance will actually cover it! Would be nice. But there goes my trip to the beach. I need to save all my money just in case i have to pay for the repairs.  Me and Bonnie are ok. We just miss each other when we apart for a long time... its fine though... And i've had the hiccups all night..and still have them this morning..how FUCKED UP is that! The meteor shower wasn't so SHOWER-E it was kinda LAME! big yawn fest on the lawn.. but at least i got to spend time with Bonnie! And Kat! I'll miss you at work even though we NEVER got to work together...i still gonna miss ya SO MUCH..you my little KITTY! Im so excited to move in next SAT. WOO HOO. My roommate called me ... damn if he AINT country! His ass is so country bumkin' I hope i never sound that country but its ok..he sounds like a down to earth chillith kinda guy! At least i'll get along with his ass for a year!"

Today the revolution of life struck my forehead!  Life is like one of those giant child's parties you are forced to attend when you are little. And at the end you are given a goody bag! You never know whats in it and if its any good or not. And in life -- that goody bag is love! Love -- you never know how its going to turn and if you'll even fall in love (recieve that goody bag) anyways!  I have been holding it back for years -- the thoughts that seemed to bounce off my brain and the inner lining of my skull.  It felt so good!! So good to finally find the courage to release them! Ahhh so nice! I feel it -- its right! This is right! I dont feel hesitant or cautious..or painful! This feels like it should have been done a long time ago! The thorns have been clipped and all thats left is that beautiful rose! The rose that has always been there but over looked by the painful mistakings it had! Now its free! The moment that rose touched my lips it was magic. It was beauty and the beast all over again and that last rose petal would have fallen... but we saved it. We broke the spell and we have made it. Now the question is -- can we save ourselves!  Can such a beautiful thing be held together by such two fragile works of art? Maybe..we'll have to find out.. i'd just like to try..."

War:

Today i changed the peircing in my eye brow. I took out the ring and replaced it with a bar-bell. Its silver too. I have a replacer -- clear! The problem with this is the fact that I can't unscrew the fucking bar-bell to get it out! stupid idiot thingy! Grrr.  I can either figure out a way to get it out or use the fucking band-aid again. I hate those fucking band-aids for work.. they're stupid. Grr. Anyways . . . . . Nothing else really happening on the home front along the lines of WAR goes...

Family:

I still haven't heard anything yet from the brother that I've looked up to for ever. I bet he just hates me and is wondering what the fuck is wrong with me. Haven't really truely spoken to me in like.. 6 years. I dont know. Things happen I guess.  The rest of that side of the family hasn't really made much of an effort either to contact me. Its been a week today. I guess I shouldn't expect too much. Though finally seeing them after so many years has started to make me appreciate what I do have. . . I just never realized it. Me and my mother are getting closer. We seem to be finding more in common. I wish i was nieve again and just thought everyone was happy so that I could be happy with everything. I'm just ready to move along -- change my name to Gavin Michael Page and get the entire family outta my scope so one day -- I can start my own family!

Friends:

Everyone seems to be cool! Dianna and Christine and Vivi are heading toward the beach this weekend! What fun!! I hope they enjoy their stay and have a super awsome experience together. Wish I could go! Kristen is ok. She's still kicking herself a little too much but that will change once college starts. She had a visit from her former best friend ANACONDA. She stopped by and confused the shit out of Kristen but its ok. Kristen said she seemed normal which doesn't mean much to me because we all know how ANACONDA's are. They are silent but deadly. I wouldn't give it a chance -- I think Kristen is wanting to give it another try which is ok. I cheer her on in fact wanting it all to work out for the best -- I just hope they dont expect me to give into something like that. Woof... I'm over it for good. Just Grr. Those Lips my ass WHORE! --smile--

Love:

Still Lingering.

Song Lyrics Of The Day:

Just like an angel you're gonna make me fly. Into your arms you're wrapping me up so tight. You have me crawling to bad - got me heals over head you got me easy you got me easy.. tangled up in my head..quit trying to hold on to help me..cause we're already beautiful.. so dont make me cry.. cause this love don't feel so right.. you cant push a river you cant make me fall.. but you can make me unreachable.. I may be sweet, but i'm still on the vine.. You couldn't wait no.. you had to take your bite.. You had me crawling so bad.. had me heals over head.. you had me easy..you had me easy.. its too late to go back to realize what we had..we were already beautiful.. so dont make me cry..cause this love dont feel right.. you can't push a river..you can't make me fall..but you can make me unreachable.. sometimes love is addiction..sometimes it hurts like hell..sometimes you can't just get enough..you can't make me love you more than i do..but you can make me unreachable..

War:

No confrontations lately. Simply trying to push the dates forward so that I can make my way to COLLEGE and see all those beautiful girls and see all the beautiful personalities!

Family:

Waiting around for a reply from the person you have wanted to hear one from for the longest time, sucks! I have mailed the letter and yes i know it will take a few days to reach and he's probably just now reading the information. Damn! Seeing my family after so many years isn't as much scary as it is a TEST. Making me nervous, anxious, built up inside. I wasn't fearful of them, more fearful of being rejected to my face even though in some small way it was what I wanted the most!
God I hope my brother has matured enough to realize that I need to hear from him soon. He is my one and only peer relation. I need his rejection/acception! Hmmm, gives me chills thinking about it. My life has become one of those long ass never ending lifetime movies they play over and over on the weekends because people love to pry into others lives. Hmm?

Friends:

Mostly everything is the same. I spent some time watching ""Monster"" with Heather the other day. And as far as i know Bonnie is ok. I hear she has recieved some information from her family. Took them long enough but I understand how that is. Trust me. And Bonnie no worries You will work everything out..and if you want a relationship with them you should go for it.. thats what I think i'm going to do with my own family situation. I am so glad I have you here to hold me..and to wish me luck..and to be my charm. Because somewhere inside..i knew you have always been there for me even when i thought i was alone..and i hope that you know i'm always there for you. Hope is hard to come by and when you find that person that seems to pour hope into your life is like finding a four leaf clover..its pretty for the first day after picking..but then it becomes bent and broken..and we have kept something to fragile so healthy! 

Love:

Still Lingering.

Song Lyrics Of The Day:

Fumbling his conifence and wondering why the world has passed him by...hopeing that he's meant for more than arguments and failed attempts to fly..we were meant to live for so much more..but we lost ourselves..somewhere we live inside. somewhere we live inside...we were meant to live for so much more..but we lost ourselves..somewhere we live inside.. Dreaming about providence and whether mice and men have second tries.. Maybe we've been living with our eyes half open..maybe we're bent and broken.. We were meant to live for so much more..and we lost ourselves..somewhere we live inside..somewhere we live inside.. We were meant to live for so much more but we lost ourselves..somewhere we live inside... .... We were more than this world's got to offer.. we were more than this world's got to offer.. we were more in the wars of our fathers.. and everything inside screams for second life..we were meant to live for so much more.. but we lost ourselves.. we were meant to live for so much more..but we lost ourselves..we were meant to live for so much more .. but we lost ourselves.. we were meant to live.. we were meant to live...

Closing Statement:

Does the art of waiting really have an expiration date? Not sure. I know people do. Can relationships really have an expiration date? I dont think they can, i think we can choose to forget or throw them away but if we are lucky they can be kept forever.

"event","Dear Diary,

War: 

If life consisted of more than disappointments, Anne wouldn't know about them. Should we tell her? Nah this is something she needs to figure out while she's clinging to her body pillow. She went psycho again. Nothing new I suppose. But Like i warned her, she was losing everyone and if she wasn't careful we would all walk away, and what happend? Ha - we walked! Except this time it isn't the dead men, its the one that finally got free. Now she can rot with herself and her body pillow.

Friends:

Yay, Rachel. Moving out on your own is scary but you are such a strong person and you know your limits. Some are ment to be broken and others are ment to be kept the same. You know which ones those are! You are such a great person dont let this PSYCHO bitch bring you down ok! Yes, she was a friend but notice past tense ""WAS"". she isn't the same and she has those mood swings and stuff all the time. She's fucking stupid!  Kristen, baby was up! how you kicked these days. You going with me right? To my families place! Damn i need you there, and sometimes i just know i Need you around all the time. I miss it when you are gone to Georgia visiting family or just we dont talk for days at a time. It sucks. We are best friends, and thats all I think it would ever be -- there is too much there to ruin!

Love: 

As i pace myself from back and forth, rubbing my stubble chin I wonder about my choices. I dont regret anything, but i must say i wish i had some other things in stead. How happy i could be right now, but would others be as happy? Some people weren't ready when I was and would it have been fair to ask them to be when I knew they weren't?! Sometimes I wish it would rain here and wash away the questions that stream from my eyes. And I will never forget those starry nights, and I'm sure everyone wishes they could have seen it. And that giant shooting star can only be shared between us three. And on those summer nights, when the breeze blows just right and the smell of melting tar catches your nose and you look to your right and your left and you see your best friends - you can't help but wonder! How awsome those moments seem to glow in my head! And as I close my eyes at night I can still taste the sweet smile you gave that day, and the times i told you to ""wake up"" and ""deal with it"" still seem to post themselvs in the recent future in our personal conversations. The times I smelled your hair. It wasn't natural I tell you, that feeling! I wanna watch you dream some more... But yet i keep my distance for the fear of losing something strong and the fear of losing myself.

Family:

Important to the developement of the youth. Or is it? Television seems to have replaces almost all or not completely replaced the need for social interaction! The desire I have for closure with mine seems to be building and I'm not sure I can take it anylonger. I think today has to be the day. But, I never really know what will happen on each day's adventures. Will i sleep and have one of those horrible dreams or will i stay awake and wonder why i'm not doing anything! I need to know why they hate me, why they never called, why they always thought i was a baby and why can't they see that i'm a grown man -- sometimes immaturely funny, but.. hey..i'm a guy..we never grow up! I want them to realize they are losing out on so much..and now they are dieing in their house with their chocolate cakes and fake christmases while i'm out in the world kicking some major ass... whether i'm alone or with my best friends..i will always have myself..and sometimes i felt that was all i had!

Song Lyric Of the Day:

Trembleing, hold me now.. I'm torn between silence and violent expression, tired of believing everyone. Wants to care and cherrish someone, i'm so scared of never having anyone. Haunted by old bad dreams. Tiny voices will one day scream. Now be still, it wont be long... We will be together in search of a new life, striving as one in this world to find something pure, i'm missing you now.. i'm quite sure that i finally found someone!

Closing Statement:

These past few days have shaken the earth under my feet, but the good thing is that I have had enough good things around to keep me floating to it hasn't affected me as much as it might have others. I'm proud of my friends and my accomplishments. I wouldn't really change much!"

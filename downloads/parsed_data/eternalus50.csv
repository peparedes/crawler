Do you like songs with no beat and HORRIBLE sound quality? Songs about Conventions? Convention goers?

This song violates certain peoples personal lives,this song is rude ,wrong and might result in some LJ cuts for me. Oh well. If youre not down with it I got two words for you...

http://music.aol.com/artist/main.adp?tab=songvid&artistid=743642

(Watch 'Belive Me' (in studio) especially you Morgan its that song you loved from my MS done live basically like it was done last night in NYC)

Fucking amazing. If you like Linkin Park listen..if you like rap listen..if you dont like rap listen..if you like spaghetti listen..my god..

Demigodz and GhostFace Killa were cool to but Fort Minor had me on the floor going nuts at Nokia Theature times square. 

Hands down better than the Eminem/50cent concert I went to. Yeah..I said it.."

"event","Ok so I have time for an update. New stuff with me is as follows..

-Joined the Gym! Yep after work I walk about 20 minutes up the road and go to World Gym! I love it! I fell inlove with a man for the first (second if you count Joe Motes) time and his name is gym! I love this place. Its all downstairs in a basement and stuff!

-I downloaded a bunch of Good Charlotte and Simple Plan songs. I love their music. The whole wearing makeup thing im really not so much down with. But the music is just awesome. Sorry Morgan. On a slightly related topic the GreenDay of today pisses me off. 

-I might be going to Wizard World Boston. 

-Im addicted to working out,energy drinks and protein bars. Im going to die young or live long.

-Do ANY of you still use your MY SPACE!? Come on! My Space is frikkin awesome. Theres tons of cool groups for anything you can think of. Also found some family and friends from my past/childhood/schooldays you get the idea!

Is murder Mase back people? Mase is most likely joining G-UNIT. Lets just say if Robia Lamorte loved gangsta rap she would listen to Mase."

Today at work my cousin pissed off this girl and her BF was coming to kick his ass. Now my cousin probally would did something wrong but im not going to let someone just beat on him. Well this guy was huge mass of muscle who would have killed us both in a second. Luckily he just yelled at my cousin and threatened him. No phsyicality. Three hours later my cousin quit the job. So I probally wont see him for a year anyway. Weird day!"

"event","Half way through my SLIDERS Season 3 DVD and its awesome. This is defintly up there on the list of my all time favorite TV shows. If they had a convention for this (which I really doubt) I would defintly attend.

The power went out for a few hours last night which sucked. I love electricity. It keeps my milk cold and my TV on. Now I have rotton milk and I lost some precious SLIDERS watching time!

I recievied one of the best Birthday presents in the mail! It finally got here from Natalie (B.Q.S). There were two things in this box. One thing I ate for dinner that night and the other is hanging on my wall.Not to forget,the box was probally the best part!

Saturday im going to hang out (literally) with Mario and Jake in Manhattan. Now I don't mind hanging out with Mario,but we all know how crazy that Jake can get.Maybe Sam can come by and keep things calm. Cheap plug -- http://www.snjw.com --

Im realizing that I can show up a good 30 minutes late to the concerts im going to. Unfortunilty Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz are part of this concert. Theyre opening though, so once they get off the stage I can enjoy 50 Cent,G-Unit,D-12,Eminem. Although I know how much Joey loves Lil Jon,so maybe he will force me to go on time. Oh well. Speaking of Joey,I threatened to kill his family,which is kinda just a thing I do. And he told his mom!! She thought it was hilarious though. Moms love me.

Yesterday was a huge thunder storm here! It was awesome. I watched the whole thing build quickly and go from being sunny out to being like night! I had a good time just standing there out in it. But then it got really bad so I had to ya know,not get struck by lightning. I also need to find out if Martin is still alive. He was riding his bike as it was starting. Haha.

I woke up this morning and the power was out again! It was back on in a few minutes though. I was going to pick up my phone and send Will an angry text message about the power being out. Saw I had one missed call from Jon. Called me at 7:30AM! Too early. I think he called because I jokingly told him I was having a pool party today.My only plans today is to go play some Horseshoes! Its more fun than it might seem!"

<i>Life.. by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life?

I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire</i>"

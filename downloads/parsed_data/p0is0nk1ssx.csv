Everyone fell asleep and ben alicia and i all stayed up listeing to music. Alicia and ben had to leave so me rachel and kevin and peter went into the backyard and chilled on the trampoline. WE went inside finally and watched tv. 12 they left and me and rachel went downstairs to watch harold and kumar go to white castle. we went to sleep about 3.

So I got up and played the sims cuz I was bored. At 12:30 I got in the shower and asked mom if she can drive all of us home and she's like yea sure w.e. so yea i called Gina and she picked me up at 4:30 and we went and picked up Leah and Emily. Before that i played more of my gay sims.We went around in circles a couple of times trying to find it and had to ask for directions, when we got there i said hey! i saw that place! and yea they were disappointed cuz i didnt say anything... i didnt know or look to see what it was.We saw mike hawrys, mike and there friend there and chilled outside for a while cuz no 1 as there. Rachel, Shelby, Emily F, and their friend came and hung out with them some more. finally went inside saw some band.. they weren't very good so we went back outside and yea goofed around, then went inside to see Matt Rowland's band play. They were awesome! Bad Science came on after and i didnt think they were really good so yea went outside again and Laura, Brooke, and Katie were there for a while so we all took pictures and goofed around some more. It was like basically over so yea the whole group sat outside and my majah picked us up at 9 and we went home. I've been sitting here for a while, not feeling like playing my game and a little angry at something that makes me want to beat someone up but yea it's all good i'm trying to get over it. Silly Peter helped he make this over the phone, i didnt think he knew how to do things like this. but i never can doubt Petey. Daanielle's friends came over and they talked with me and yea had soem weird moments tghen left. So i sit here... This was long so that was my day."

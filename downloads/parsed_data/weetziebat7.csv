"event","i just did a grave-rubbing, it came out better then i though it would, it was my first, i'll try to take a picture of it later, and tomorrow i might go to mount auburn cemetery, so i know i'd get a bunch more if i do that, the only thing is...it's a huge cemetery and it's summer and i would need my huge+akward newsprint notebook thing(for grave-rubbing), so it wouldn't be too easy.
i really need to work on a layout for this journal, the default looks like shit."

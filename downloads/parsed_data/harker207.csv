This looks MUCH better than the poo that was OoTP.

"event","I've been playing with my new camera and while I freely admit that I know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about still cameras, the bare rudiments of composition and almost nothing about lighting, I'm still pretty happy with the way some of these came out.  I've been futzing with a couple in iPhoto and I look forward to taking more and learning more about how my camera works and how photography overall works.  I think it'll make me even better at my job when filming and will definitely be a nice outlet creatively.

Also, we went to see ""In the Heights"" and it was absolutely incredible.  I cannot recommend it enough to everyone.  Not that they really need your money because they're doing quite well, but go see it!  Go!  At once!"

"event","We're back from Jamaica.  Other than their complete disbelief in either vegetarianism (at one meal, Amy was served semi-soft carrots and cauliflower) or homosexuality (drink every time you get asked if you're sisters... we counted six), it was a great time.  We did... NOTHING.  Absolutely nothing.  Except go down waterslides and drink lots of ""dark and stormys"".  I discovered the joy of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee (yes, after giving up soda, in the same breath, I took up coffee).  We brought back rum and coffee and (Amy at least) sunburns to remember our trip.  She also posted photos on flickr, here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/amymlitt/sets/72157616219719003/
and on facebook.

In other news, I applied to a graduate program at Columbia's Teachers College (an M.A. in Communication in Education) and I'm waiting to hear back from them now.  I also just purchased a Canon Rebel XT because I have a shitty digital camera that takes worse pictures than my phone does and after taking some photos with Amy's camera, I am resolved to become an enthusiastic hobbyist... or at least take fun pictures of my friends at the bar.  So, ummm, for now, that's it.  Off to a polenta breakfast!"

"event","So, the soda thing is going pretty well... I've been down to about a glass a week and it doesn't taste as satisfying as it did before.  I also noticed (well, Amy noticed) that the raccoon bags under my eyes disappear and I'm generally much less puffy without soda.  

For the last five days, I've been eating big salads at lunch and going to the gym for about 30 minutes a day-- alternating between swimming, interval running and interval stationary bikes-- with a bit of weight lifting.  I also took on a once a week pilates class on Tuesdays for the intersession at school.  Amy and I are going to a yoga class on Monday downtown that's free.

I plan on rewarding myself by eating whatever the hell I want on weekends and not really worrying about exercising then.  After only one week I already feel trimmer, healthier and more even in my temperament.  My plans are to keep this up through the month of January and see how I feel and how far it takes me and then proceed from there.  I think I will enjoy a daily workout regimen and even if I don't always eat salads at work, I need to consciously consume many more vegetables and fruits and I feel that that will evolve naturally from this process."

"event","My father, in a staggering moment of actually listening to me, got me exactly what I wanted for Christmas-- the George Foreman Next Grilleration with swappable plates.  In the three days since it came into my possession, I've used it to make several arugula, tomato and mozzarella panini and now, vegan apple cider waffles.  All the plates are dishwasher safe and this one also came with a bonus: omelette plates, so I no longer have to admit that I can't flip an omelette to save my life.  Instead, I can make small individually sized omelettes with a whisk and a pour.

This is the best toy ever.  I highly recommend it.  I soon plan on grilling some thin cut chicken breasts to chop up and put in the arugula to make myself salads with for work.  Unfortunately, the George Foreman is not sophisticated enough to go to the grocery store for me and buy these things, so that errand will have to wait until I have pants on."

"event","So today is the 500th day of me quitting smoking.  It actually doesn't bother me so much that I keep active track of it, but I keep a widget on my desktop that tells me so.  It's a good way of giving me a sense of passive achievement.

I quit drinking regular soda a while ago because I figured I didn't need the tons of extra calories.  So I switched to diet.  I have a bitching caffeine/sugar addiction.  However, I haven't really lost any weight at all switching to diet soda.  I figured that some of it had to do with the quitting smoking, slower metabolism and all that...  I also figured that my only real sacrifice would be in dental health, and that was low on my priority list...

Then I read this....

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/nutrition/05symp.html?ref=health

and realized that a lot of the abdominal fat I'm trying to shed is probably related.  So, I've decided, slightly grudgingly, that my next big life change is to give up/drastically reduce my soda intake (currently rated at a LOT daily).

More than with cigarettes or anything else, I dread the withdrawal.  I figured I could switch to coffee... since I've started drinking that lately too... but I normally take it with two sugar packets.

Does anyone know anything about this?  Would switching exclusively to coffee with sugar help eliminate the abdominal fat (assuming that I exercise 2-3 times a week currently regardless of other factors)?  Is it just a bloating thing too?  Would the real sugar in the coffee offset the benefit of the fake sugar in the diet soda?  Do I just need to start drinking black coffee and eliminate all the sugar?

Thoughts?  Opinions?"

"event","Bacon does not, in fact, make everything better.  One of the things it does not improve is my prized weekend garlic bagel with scallion cream cheese.  Why the lady making my bagel felt compelled to use the bacon scallion cream cheese instead, or, in fact, why the bacon scallion cream cheese exists, eludes me.  The bacony salt overwhelms the scalliony goodness and it throws off the balance of my delicious ""I like my coworkers so I don't order this at Nussbaum & Wu's"" treat.

Dammit, bagel lady."

It is difficult, in this world, to believe in something.
We'd all have a much easier time being cynical, expecting the worst, criticisizing others.

Our whole lives we've been told
that this day would never come.
There would be an American president
who is Black
who is mixed
who is from an immigrant family
who has a Muslim name
who spent part of his youth in another country
who was raised by a single mother and her mother
who's wife and children look and sound like his do
who worked in the City as a community organizer
who believes that cooperation with every corner the world is the best way to lead
who believes that our role as a beacon of hope is the best way to shield us from harm
who believes that we are only as strong as the weakest among us

And... here we are in heaven.

Barack Hussein Obama appealed to our better angels
He asked us to be better than that
He never expected us to be petty
or worried that we were too shell shocked by 9/11 to accept change
or feared that we couldn't handle the journey into the future. 

He knew who America really was.

America is why Rosa sat
Martin marched
and why Barack ran
so our children will fly.

I may be young
but I've never been so proud to be American."

"event","Lately, I've been making a lot more vegetarian food.  Gradually, I'm becoming more comfortable with this, because it's very fun to feed tasty things to my girlfriend.  Last week I did mock beef fajitas with sauteed peppers and onions and last night I did mock sausage and pepper sub sandwiches.  I was actually very surprised that the snausage-in-a-tube is quite tasty once you cook it in a little bit of oil.  I'd like to come up with a good mock meat jambalaya or some way of effectively utilizing my barbecue dry rub on some mock meat stuff.  Thoughts, oh vegetarians?"

-- Have Wii Fitted every day save one in the last ten.  I have probably lost about a pound or so (hard to tell with weight fluctuations), but I am definitely already looking more toned and fit, as well as sleeping better, feeling stronger and standing straighter.  I've also been eating a lot more fiber and drinking more water and generally feeling better about life.

-- Feeling slightly less ulcerous about my job overall, but still eager to jump ship.

-- Dad may have actually succeeded with my birthday present (my own Wii).  We'll see in about five or six days.

-- I have started a new official blog to focus exclusively on writing and what I've managed to figure out about writing as a professional reader.  I can't make commenting work on iWeb (thoughts are appreciated) but if you all wanna go check it out, that'd be awesome.  It's www.writistsblog.com.  I'll be trying to update that one at least every couple of days.

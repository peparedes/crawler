What is goin on in this world around me? What are my friends and family doin?

How is my mom doing at the hospital?
How is my dad handling it at the hospital with my mom?
Is Jas still working at the ridiculously confusing puzzle with her Sis, and Phil?
What music are Travis and Ross working on at this time of night?
Is Nicki still enjoying her party for graduation?
Did Des' finally get through her stomach pain and fall asleep peacefully? Will she be coming home soon?

I guess I'll have to wait and see... But I feel so un-accomplished, already a month of summer gone by and I haven't accomphlished shit! I have so many goals, but even more lack of motivation... For every one thought of happiness I feel ten thoughts of unhappiness trail it... 

I think in the next week I should try and accomplish something..."

One good thing is that I asked Jasmine to go with me to keep me company and hang out with me before I go in, and after I come out... Which is kool because I won't be all nervous knowing Jas is there to keep me from going all nuts... She hasnt ever been to a hospital, or had a surgery so now she can see what its like... I am so glad she agreed to go, and that her mom said it was ok... Yay!! Maybe it wont be so bad after all... I can only pray...

She claims she loves me, but I doubt it, if she really loved me she'd talk to me and quit avoidin the situation, oh wait, whats right, she doesnt care because I am the friend she cares least about, whatever..

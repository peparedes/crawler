I guess it is true, if you put your mind to something,you can do anything! Lol I know that sounds cheesey but it is true. Nothing real exciting has happened lately, but I am sure something will happen soon. And if not, it's all good, it's kinda nice that everything is so calm."

"event","I don't know what's wrong with me lately, it is crazy, I feel like a 14 year old girl. It's like the last 10 years of my life have been erased, at least for the moment. I am starting to get shy around people, blush when talking to guys, it's as if the whole prospect of men has become innocent, back to the days when talking to a guy you think is cute is the most amazing feeling in the whole world. Back when things were easy, back when you weren't jaded by the thought of dating, and you didn't know what real love and heartbreak was. Back to the times, when best friends meant everything in the world to you, where you could act silly an crazy and not care! Back to when you had crushes on boys who didn't even know you existed. Back to when you never really got to see just how cruel love could be. Back to the days when life seemed so much eaiser. Maybe I am just crazy, maybe this is my way of ignoring what is really going on with me, maybe I am in denial, or maybe just maybe I am sick of hurting, sick of not being able to trust anyone, or get close to anyone. Maybe I hate being afraid of getting my heart broken again, maybe I just want to believe again. Maybe I wish I wasn't soooo afraid of everything and everyone, afraid to try again. Maybe just maybe I am insane and crazy and people should just stay far far away from me."

"event","I have made it one week and one day without a ciggerette, have made it two weekends without getting drunk, and have drank more cups of coffee than any human being has ever had in a week. It'll be 4:00 in the morning and I will be drinking the largest cup of coffee 711 has to offer. I don't really sleep much either the past 2 weeks cuz of all the caffine. I think I may be a tad crazy at this point, you can see me in my own little world bouncing around to every and anything that is playing at that time. I also have had a tendency to have a stupid grin on my face no matter what is going on. I guess I have just been in a daze, I woke up one day and became my old self, the innocent girl I was once before cardozo & college & boys. Crazy shit, I wonder how long this feeling is going to last..."

"event","I just got called mean, for telling this kid, who I was friends with like 6 years ago, that I really just had no interest in hanging out with him again. He's been asking me like every other day to hang out, and just didn't get the point that I keep mking excuses why I couldn't. It kills me when you try to be nice to people by not telling them your never going to hang out with them, but they don't get the point after like forever that it is not going to happen, it's like come on wtf??? I dont like being harrased into hangin out with someone, god telling me to take a cab at 3 in the morning to their house and shit, it's like wtf??? And then after harassing you like that not just letting it go when you say you don'twant to hang out, you finally just say hey listen, to tell you the truth, I don't want to hang out with you, they get mad at you and tell you you are mean???? I mean seriously, I tried to be nice, but you us didn't get the point, I mean seriously even after saying listen I just don't want o be your friend, still telling me, oh come on,hang out with me, I think you'll like me, for like ever.... COME ON after a while of saying no, it's like what part of NO don't you understand???? god sometime i really hate people, why won't they stop telling me who I am and what I want, when they don't even know me??? Arrrrggg I also hate that people get mad at mefor telling them the truth, it's like they'd rather me lie to them.... I always tell the truth because it hurts mre when you lie to people, because they always find out the truth in the end and then it is 10 times worse.... lol maybe I should start smoking again so I don't have to deal with this stress (just kidding I actually right now absolutely love not smoking, I hope this feeling lasts)"

"event","It has been one week since I have had a ciggerette, go me! The only problem now is that in place of smoking  have resorted to massive amouts of coffee & caffine. Lol also I have found myself cursing alot more since I quit.... hmmmmm interesting. The greatest thing though is ever since I have quit I have been alot happier. That could be the medication, but hey I will take it either way. OH my god, why do have the fucken worst luck ever when it comes to guys,(not that i know if I am even ready to trust or get involved with one) old asian men who work in retail stores seem to have a thing for me, which I am not sure I understand, also guys who work out and have like big muscles and shit (not that muscle you perv ;p ) which I am sooooooo not attracted to! I just don't even know where to begin anymore if has been soooo long since I have had to meet guys, the last time I was single was like 6 years ago and I was in high school....it is crazy. ALso where do you meet people when your 24 and out of school? I mean seriously????? Lol too bad I gave up boys and love with ciggerettes because in the end I aways get hurt, people always leave me, and quite frankly doing all that over again just does not seem fun. Also I don't want a repeat of what happened with the first and only person I dated since albany to happen again, some people should just be friends. You have to be careful who you give your heart to, because sometimes it might be a bitch to get it back. You can give four years of your life to someone and they can dissapear as if it never happened leaving you to figure out what went wrong. Wow crazy.... the things you think about at 4:00 in the morning ohhhhhh 4:44 make a wish!"

But at the same time I see good things happening to really crappy people. It sucks because it makes me mad that evil people are getting what they want while I am getting nothing. But then again maybe in the end I will wind up with everything I want, while those people are left with nothing. Here's to wishful thinking!"

"event","So far the year 2005 has been quite eventful for everyone of my friends but me, lol. I am not really sure if I should be scared about it or incredibly hopeful that all is finally right with the world. All my friends are finding love and happiness and that is  amazing for them, cuz I love them all, but it also led me to the inevitable conclusion, that we are growing up, and thats what is crazy. It seems like only a year or two ago I was in high school with no worries, where relationships we innocent, short lived, and eaisly forgotten, where there was no responsibilities, but it's been almost 6 years since my high school days, which have been some of the hardest, and greatest at the same time. Seeing everything fall nto place around me, may finally give me hope that things can and will get better. That even though you can strike out hard and big time, one day you will finally get what you deserve and find someone or something you love, and who loves you. Yup yup I am back to beig a hopeless romantic, at least for this week."

My only problem now, is learning how to shut my mouth, or at least making sure things come out of it the way I want them to, instead of comming out ike I am a raving crazy bitch. I cant help it there are justcertain people who I get completetly nervous around when I talk to them, and everything I want to say never gets said, but I do wind up saying the worst most stupid thing ever. Go me, what can I say I am far from slick. I guess I will just never b able to say what it is I want to say to certan people, because I know that  am crazy for feeling the way I do about them to begin with. Ir maybe the problem is I need to have a little more confidence in myself. Oh well I guess I will never know..... lolnow that I have ranted and raved about that shit, I am pissed, I finally found a jacket that I love and am not allergic to, and of course they only have it in small at H&M and thai s a little too small, an a large which was a little too big, Mediumw ould have been perfect, but of course they didn't have it in a medium, so as i that isn't enough me and my mom were going to go to the H&M in the mall, but affic was soo fuckin bad, I get the bright idea to go to the new H&M in Manhasset, we get there and guess fuckin what!!! They only sellgirls clothes, and the jacket was a guy jacket, god damn it it fuckin figures!!!! Oh well I guess I willrealy just have to freze my ass off this winter, because apparently I am not meant t have a winter jacket. I swear why do amazing and good people always have the worst luck!"

You're the words that come out easy,
And I am speechless at best.
Your star it seems to shine above the rest.
You're the face before the cameras,
The smile i'd like to earn.
The closest thing to perfect,
In a hollywood to burn.
You're the beauty that is deeper,
Than eyes can merely see.
The closest thing to perfect.
But the farthest thing from me.

I'd love to be,
The shoulder that you cry on.
I'd love to be,
The friend you call when things are great.

You're the dream that hasn't ended,
And I'm still anxious for rest.
Your words they seem to hang above my head.
You're the bud before the flower,
Unfurls into full bloom.
Captivating beauty,
But it maybe all too soon.
You're the song that writes a story,
But leaves alot to read.
The closest thing to perfect,
But the farthest thing from me.

And like I really deserve a chance to,
Sit across the table,
And tell you that I think you're wonderful.
And I think you're something special.
I guess this is my only chance to,
Say I wish I knew you,
Because I'm sure you're wonderful,
If I'd get to know you.

Stupid fucking oral exam tomorrow. Blah. Stupid fucking indecisive French summer of humid doom.

On the upside, the mosquito that prevented me from sleeping the last couple of nights has fucked off and hopefully died. I have no remorse for openly wishing death on another creature if it has spent two nights trying to eat me.

In other news, I have been doing little but watching anime on youtube, playing with bittorrent, being confounded by The World Ends With You (is it just me or would that make an awesome title/line for story/something?! *IGNORES FACT THAT IS ALREADY TITLE*) and trying to PACK for GOING HOME OMG TWO MORE SLEEPS WTF.

"event","So. After the wtf nights I've been having I finally got a decent night's sleep, except for the mosquito friend I appear to hve acquired, and also it was hotter than the sun even with the window open. Also before you start laughing at me for having the windows open and then complaining about mosquitoes, there's this awesome thing by which you can close the shutters but for slits between the slats, so I do that and open the window, which opens inside. That way I get a nice air flow, and the mozzies have no idea that they could get in. Except maybe this one.

On that note, I'd like to say that mosquito-whine is fifty billion times more annoying than the mosquitoes themselves."

I don't know why I do this omg. Bad Danni, no biscuit.

I did write Serizawa's death scene on the way there, so that's ok.

And somehow I got home ok despite barely being able to make out the fucking HOUSES ON THE STREET WTF ALCOHOL so that's ok as well. But it appears that I sneaked out, as it were, some morsel of seriousness deep within me thinking ""I NEED TO GET A METRO HOME SO STICK WITH LAUREN WHO ALSO HAS TO."" She didn't, bu she pointed me in the right direction of the metro and apparently it was working and oh God really, WHY did I feel the need.

We kind of wanted to see Goya and electro-flamenco as well!

Also. Alexis eats butter from the knife. We are clearly made for each other. Ho yes.

Yes, I know my tiny insignificant (stop laughing) crush on him is ridiculous and will come to nothing, but ohmygod he is so cool. SO COOL I TELL YOU.

On other, probably more boring notes, the second season of Mitchell and Webb seems to have surpassed the first one (which, you know, wasn't bad at all) and I finally gave in to boredom and andom vague rumours and started watching Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann. And it's well cute :D The art style's very playful, the characters are all insane, and the story quickly takes on a more mature twist than usual. But please, world, STOP with the killing of characters I like, please? PLEASE?

And my nagging doubt about Autumn has completely vanished. This is partly due to my taking a short break from it without feeling guilty and coming back when I felt in the mood, and partly because Laura read the latest... I dunno, twenty something pages last night. And as she read, I read along with her. And all that worry about my writing style getting stripped down as I went on, how it felt like a dry (or else poorly-covered) list of events, how everything seemed to get mechanical and devoid of feeling? Gone. Utterly gone. Laura's generous compliments helped, of course *blush like mad*

Our Literature teacher (who is amazing and I love him omg) told us that Proust said his work was a cathedral, never finished, never perfect, because as soon as you've perfected the beginning again your style has improved and you have to smooth out the rest and all that jazz. I guess I was too involved in the building to step back and think ""Wow, I've actually done a lot of work on this already, haven't I?"" I think this is what happened. I took more care than I thought I had in the typing up of drafts, and I actually researched 1860s seafaring vessels (I seriously forgot I had done that lol) and cleaned up the mistakes of time and place, added more sumo wrestlers and voila, I have something (still unfinished of course) that I can be proud of."

"event","I finally gave into the hype and saw Bienvenue Chez Les Ch'tis, and it was AWESOME. Catherine Kaisermann said it wasn't that great, and that women is hilarity on legs, but she lied this time. I almost pissed myself a good few times. AND it was in French.

Today I saw Las Vegas 21 (also in French) with the girl who needs to lighten the fuck up. I have expanded this: she not only needs to lighten the fuck up, but she needs to stop saying ""well, in OUR country"" as if England's like the model for all things great and good. Las Vegas 21 is pretty good, if far too Hollywood in places (seriously, the main character does not need a foil ALL THE FUCKING TIME), and the soundtrack is nice. Also nice eye-candy. And yes, I did walk away from that film feeling just a little bit cooler.

One thing the English girl who needs to lighten the fuck up is correct about is the state of driving in France. Seriously, people. Being a dick on the road does not make you cool. Parking like a three-legged cat with Parkinsons does not make you cool. Not even if you're wearing your best Converse and Eastpak bag at the time. We saw someone trying a 3498265802 point turn in the middle of a junction on a main road today. I know nothing about cars and driving and roads and all that shit, but even I was like ""WAIT WHUT?""

Seriously, France. Getting run over by your crazy drivers is NOT on my list of things to do.

Back to Paris for the weekend with the host family, hurrah! I love them so much. Every time I come back up to my room after dinner I have a ridiculous grin on my face, because even just talking to them makes me happy. And makes me realise how awesome my French has become. People told me this would happen, and I didn't believe them.

Have enrolled for my modules this year as well. AT LAST!"

Alexis, on a scouts trip to Africa for a month, brought back the head of a goat they had eaten. In a plastic bag. On the plane. Over a period of three days. He still has the skull in his house. I actually need to marry him. Or at least get his email address.

Florent (the mysterious third, married, son) is more conventional, a video game fan and a musician. Apparently they moved the computer into the garage for a while and found him sitting in the car with the keyboard in his hand, trying to make it work. Or else he had made it work through crazy magic already. I'm not sure. My French still needs a polish or <s>two</s>fifty million.

In other news, I went to La Piscine at Roubaix with Lauren on a random whim after hearing that it's free for students on Fridays. Luckily I have my actual student card because I keep it in my moleskine which I shall never, ever, ever lose. EVER. It is too pretty to lose.

So, La Piscine is an old swimming pool that was converted into a museum/art gallery, and as such is incredibly awesome. There was a temporary 'zoo' exhibition, by which they meant they had taken all kinds of little sculptures and paintings and sketches and studies and EVERYTHINGS of every animal they could and displayed them. It was unbearably cute, though with a propensity for animals killing each other. Especially panthers, for some reason, though there was a <s>RHINO</s>LION vs <s>BABY</s>TIGER! and also, *slightly* horrifically, a BIG DOG vs BLACK GUY sculpture (not in the zoo but still omg).

The whole layout of the place was so pretty though, and in the shop they had a copy of Perrault's fairy tales!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which I NEED with NEEDING but it was 20 euros so I thought ""How about later when you have your own money to spend."" and got a postcard of one of the animal exhibits instead. Yay!

Today has been, in general, a good day."

So, in France they have Mother's Day, and Father's Day, and a kind of 'children's day' on 6th December (St Nicholas) and they even have Grandma's Day. Guillemette asked us if we knew when Grandad's Day is.

It was a trick question, because there isn't one.

Life expectancy.

Women live longer. Basically, there just AREN'T ENOUGH GRANDADS FOR A GRANDAD'S DAY.

I think that's the saddest thing I ever heard. Couldn't they even have a joint Grandparents' Day? ;_; Poor grandads.

Also there was YET ANOTHER strike today. The trains, this time. I usually think it's pretty funny (though the reason is very complicated and I can see both sides, and just ugh let's not get into it because it's lame) but they had fireworks in the street which just freaked me out completely.

Also I cried at everything because my hormones think it's funny or something. Seriously. I mean, usually I'm watching GITS and that incredibly sad episode about Kuze and Motoko comes on and I sob, or [SANDMAN SPOILERS CENSORED FOR DARYL BY THE WAY YOU HAVE TO FINISH THAT] and I cry like a small child, or I hear how unbelievable Origa's voice is or the I Do song or the Tachikoma all die (GITS makes me cry a lot, actually. Why the hell do I watch it!?) or Frasier is really nice to Ros or my sister finishes Kingdom Hearts. But yesterday. I was walking to uni, and a guilty pleasure song came onto my iPod - namely, Morning Musume's Happy Summer Wedding. And I was listening to it, and suddenly it all hit me.
Song: ""Hey dad, this is whateverhisnameis. He's not the best person in the universe, but he likes fishing...""
Me: ""OH GOD FISHING IS HIS HOBBY *sniffle*""
Song: ""And you said that a guy who likes fishing can't be bad...""
Me: ""HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY! *sob* THEY WILL BE SO HAPPY TOGETHER!""
Song: ""Right, dad?""
Me: *cries*

I have officially hit a new low. Lololol.

I survived!

My dad deserves special mention for dropping everything to come and see me and comfort me and sort this ridiculous mess out. Before I get to that, though, I should also thank his boss for suggesting it in the first place, Linda for letting him stay there at such short notice, and the woman at the train station who took pity on him when he missed his first train.

So I have money now :D I honestly never realised how important it is in today's society. I couldn't get a drink from the venders during the lesson break, I couldn't buy my dinner wherever, I couldn't replace the folder I stupidly lost.

Also have decided to go to the police station and get a copy of the report just before I go. It will be more plausible and less sad to have lost it between now and then. I am just an English girl, after all.

It's amazing how a day can change everything.

We saw the Citadel (though not the free zoo; my sense of direction fails SO HARD) and I showed him the Opera House and La Grande Place (and le Furet, hurrah) and he met my host family, which was quite lovely. I had to play translator though XD And my dad looked terrified the entire way through, but there was porto and La Grangier as aperitif, so that was okay. Haha.

The time passed really quickly, actually.

So, I'm still absolutely knackered, and I have a two and a half hour lesson on Civilisation, yaaaaay, and I think I lost the sheet we got last week which we probably need for today, so I fail there. But I usually forget to bring them anyway. At least my natural irresponsibility has softened the blow of being unable to be well-prepared?

OR SOMETHING.

On to the subjunctive in grammar class, LOL, there's something I always wanted to find out I never understood at all.

RIP Toshi ;_; I guess you can meet the real Toshi now and be anti-social with each other? <3"

You know, from a karmic standpoint, I probably had it coming. I must admit that I usually try to be a nice person as far as I can, but too many good things have been happening to me recently. I've been offered so many good opportunities by so many people who don't owe me anything.

I have never been more humiliated, because I know you're all actually thinking that yes, it is my fault really. I should have been so much more careful omg. AT A MARKET.

Well fuck you all for today. I'm not in the mood. I'm angry and in pain (thank you uterus. You have the most awesome timing. REALLY.) and I'm up here in my (Alexis') room with tears streaming down my face, again, not helped by the uterine happenings, praying that church goes on forever so I don't have to cry in front of my host family. Really, I just want to be able to say ""Hey, my bank card was stolen, can I use the phone?"" and also speak on the phone without sounding like a twat. It is a purse. It is not the end of the world. God, I KNOW. The only things of any REAL importance in it were my bank card and my money. The rest is replaceable, and thank FUCK they didn't take my passport.

"event","As many of you now know, I spent from Wednesday evening to Sunday evening near Dunkerque and Calais in a lovely country house, with Patrick, Christiane, and Patrick's brother and his boyfriend, both called Michel. Yeah, I know. I thought I was just being a stupid foreigner, but they do, in fact, share a name. It was both easier and more confusing.

So I slept in a kind of big attic where the kids (remember the big Northern French familes now) were all bundled off to, and it hadn't been cleaned all winter, so I ended up sharing with spiders, only some of whom bit me :D You know how it is. You see one spider, and then, like some wretched second sight you become aware of them all. I counted eleven in my room.

Which brings us to the theme of this entry! THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT AND THE SAME IN FRANCE AND JAPAN!

Spiders.

There were no spiders in Japan that I saw, and certainly none that I had to live with. Cicadas? Yes. Cockroaches? Yes, ick. That little fucker with all the legs and the squiggly? Dear God make the memory go away. But no spiders.

In France, the spiders appear to be mostly those creepy fuckers with the tiny bodies and the long, thin legs. Imagine one of them walking over your face. Or don't. Eew.

Salad.

This is surprisingly similar. In Japan, as Weste-sensei told us, salad is a shredded lettuce. In France, salad is a lettuce, not shredded but drowned in dressing. Mmhmm.

Racial lols.

I am still defined by my Englishness :( though I guess this would be the same wherever I go. In Japan I was part of TEAM IGIRISU, and here I am ""la petite Anglaise"". Oh well. May as well enjoy being different. Also people keep trying to speak to me in broken, heavily-accented English and I still feel bad when I can't understand them. Also it is very different and interesting to be not noticeably foreign. As long as I keep my mouth shut (lol accent) no one can tell I'm not French myself. Does make me look like a twat when I try to talk to people without them knowing I am foreign.

Personal Space.

This is wildly different, and I must say I prefer the French open affection to the Japanese ""OH GOD I TOUCHED ANOTHER PERSON SEPPUKU TIEM NAO"" privacy. 

Food.

Food is very, very important to the French as it is for the Japanese, and they too have their own little rules that trip me up all the damn time. Such as peeling fruit! LIKE JAPAN! They peel apples, pears, fucking CUCUMBERS, everything with a skin. They think I am strange and slightly unhygienic for enjoying the skin.

Stationery.

French stationery is expensive, and that makes me sad. What's more, the quality of the pens hasn't really inspired much confidence in me. Boo. Not quite as awesome as Japanese stationery, but Le Furet Du Nord is still my favourite place here, haha.

Yes, this is a very important aspect of any country to me.

Lovely people.

Everyone in France is also very nice and would do anything for you. Which means I must take the time to reinforce my point that any ignorant generalising of the French people as a nation WILL earn you a slap from me.

So yeah. So far apart from the blatant differences, my countrywide experiences seem to have their common points. Oh, humanity is just one big race of people, yadda yadda.

So, the long weekend was brilliant. I saw Calais, Gravelines, the dunes of Slack, Blanc-Nez, Gris-Nez, Ambleteuse and uncountable little villages and things. I have photos, so don't worry <3

Ran out my third pen since I got here. Grrr.

This weekend is ANOTHER long one, as the 8th of May and whatever Monday is are holidays. So I'm off to Normandy to stay in one of Christiane's relatives' holiday homes there (oh my God France I love you) and kitten-pile in with a big family crowd. Which should be fun!"

"event","So. Yesterday. Firstly I woke up late (OOPTH) and then completely forgot that in order to get to uni for 9.30 I have to set off around 9, which means no, dear, you can't have breakfast at 9. Which was fun. Managed to make it in by the skin of my teeth anyway, new buiding and all, so hurrah for me!

I am rather loving the literature and cinema class *geeks out to self*

Unfortunately, it finished at 12, leaving me with a long afternoon to fill and not much to fill it with, so I tagged along for a panini and baby-clothes-shopping for a while, and then hung out in Le Furet Du Nord (yes, again) so I could buy yet moar French manga (oh CLAMP how I love you <3) and stickers with which to decorate my awesome new folder. Interesting thing there: it rained on the way back and I realised that stickers would not last long on the outside. Maybe I would have been better off just doodling on scraps of paper and sellotaping them to the inside? Oh, it's always the small things that keep my little mind occupied.

On the way back, wonder of wonders, I bumped into yet more Englishers and tagged along with *them* for a while. And a good thing I did, too, or I would have missed Carly's rollerblading debut and the two falls that occurred therein. We did laugh. And she was a bit sad. But that's fine. I checked.

We abandoned her at uni where she had to take her bus home, and as we passed the delightful little park on the other side of the road (it truly is delightful. Waterfalls and little caves and all sorts of wonders) we saw this guy. He was kind of standing facing the bushes, and at first I thought he was peeing, but... no. Oh no. That would have been NOT QUITE DISGUSTING ENOUGH.

Oh God. I mean... seriously? In a PARK? In BROAD DAYLIGHT?

I kind of felt like Daryl, haha... I sympathise with you, sweetness, if this is the kind of thing you attract."

I wet to Le Furet Du Nord finally <33 and bought xxxHolic in French XDD BECAUSE I AM MADE OF WIN. Also I bought a folder. It's really tempting to be twelve again and decorate it with the awesome.

As soon as I got home, it really started to piss down, hailstones and everything. But I was inside, so I laughed at everyone out in it. Ahahahaha. Mine is an evil laugh.

And my host family seem to be obsessed with watching the weather on TV. OMG WHAT WILL BE THE WEATHER TOMORROW? Bless them. I should have paid more attention yesterday, and then I would have known it would rain! But those guys talk so FAST. All I see are pictures with numbers and moving pictures and stuff. I spend half of the time thinking ""OK, so where the fuck is Lille on this contextless map?""

I cornered Eiko (and Junko! There are four of them!) and spoke LOTS of Japanese, which was awesome and I loved it. People have asked on and off if I can speak Japanese, and I'm always like ""Yeah, a bit.""

OK, here's the lowdown on my life here so far. (this post will also be sent around as an email to the Japan Update Guys, so if you have to read it twice, I apologise kind of half-heartedly).

Pre-Arrival

I hate packing. I just can't stand it. So obviously the world wasn't going to let me get away with it being straightforward, and my case broke the night before my journey. Damn. So I had to bring a smaller one, which, thankfully, fitted enough stuff for me to survive on. Before the case incident, Ashleigh had already planted in my mind the idea that the arrival time on my ticket which I had given my host family was England time, so I sent them a quick and apologetic email correcting this. Naturally, the night before travelling, as I lay in bed, I realised that no, the ticket gave the right time and I had just set myself up for an hour's wait alone at Lille-Europe. The journey to London went mostly without a hitch, apart from being stuck for a while in an accident-induced traffic jam. It turns out the accident was a truck that had actually burst into flame, so I can't really complain. When we got to St Pancras (not St Pancreas, mam)I desperately tried to text my host family with the second time correction, only to completely forget that countries have those little code things. I finally realised this and got it, and texted, praying that it would get there.

Then it was through to customs, where I was pulled aside and asked by a nice lady how old I was.

""Twenty one,"" I replied sweetly.

Her coworker sniggered.

I told her she could look at my passport if she needed to, but she declined, saying that she was going to ask for my mam, as was standard procedure because she thought I looked thirteen or fourteen. Okay, world, I get it. I look young. Stop with the jokes already.

I swore to myself gently as I boarded and disembarked from the train, to reassure myself. The journey itself went without a hitch. Suddenly I was unbelievably self-conscious of being English, as I never was in Japan. Which was weird, seeing as you really can't tell us apart unless you're a freak.

Arrival in Lille!

I was met after a few nail-biting minutes by my host family, who are very kind and talkative and have senses of humour, and driven around Lille and then home. Lille is beautiful. You must all come here. At home, I have a small private bathroom and it is lovely. The house looks pretty small from the outside, but it's one of those Tardis houses with fifty billion floors and there's loads of space everywhere. I was left to unpack and settle, and was then called for dinner, where I found that my host family had grown somewhat. Christiane's sister Veronique and her children Julie and Gael (I think that's how it's spelt?) and Christiane's mother joined us for dinner, and, exhausted, I tried to make conversation and was fed very, very well. Also we drank champagne. And then wine with dinner. I am going to return home a fat alcoholic, and I don't even care. We had raquelette, a kind of cheese-potato-fondue thing from around the Alps.

I then learned how to play a couple of card games in French (hurrah!) and stumbled off to bed around 11.

Day Two!

My host family are Catholic, so we went to a monastery for mass today. I know, right? A MONASTERY. WITH MONKS. It was lovely, though I had no idea what the priest was saying most of the time. It was a lot more musical than English mass, and the Creed was in Latin. And musical.

For. The. Win.

We met up with about six of Patrick and Christiane's friends, and went to the house of one couple for dinner. Their house was a lovely little country one (I think it's one they only use on weekends or something?) with a huge gigantic garden and the skinniest, oldest dog I've ever seen. Bless him. The aperitif (there is always an aperitif) was mushrooms and fish eggs (surprisingly tasty, considering my hatred of Japanese fish eggs). More champagne, red and white dinner wine and a large, large dinner later, we sat around in the sun and talked (the weather was gorgeous) for a few more hours, and I found out that my French really isn't that bad. Then a nice long walk around the village (I saw Belgium from afar! And a big hole in a field from WW2) and it was about seven o clock. Home time.

I napped in the car on the way back, we had tea (omg I was actually hungry for it as well), and now I am here.

Tomorrow is lessons. Oh dear.

Vive la France!"

On the preparations side, I've already left the packing to last minute and had the obligatory hilarious antics involving time differences. Dear God why can't everything be the same time!? WHY GOD WHY. IT WOULDN'T BE WEIRD AT ALL.

I wanted to go to Leeds, but packing is fail so I couldn't *frowny face*.

I don't know what else to say except that Buck-Tick's Black Cherry is the perfect music to go bra-shopping to, and I am so excited that I wish to run around and around until I tire myself out. I love everything and everyone, except writing sex scenes and battle scenes, which are really fucking hard and can piss off back where they belong.

"event","So. 21 today. Hurray! There are no officially no more milestones that life can fob me off with - I am now an adult!

Due to me exploding over exams, there was no birthday wishlist to pass out to relatives, so there was lots of money instead <3 Which is going towards starting a decent life for myself when I get out of uni at last, yay savings account. So we went into town before going for a meal with both parents (it's weird to see them together, especially when they're civil. I know that sounds wrong, but it just is. I'm sure I'll get used to it) to open super-special-awesome savings accounts, and Ashleigh's already half-filled in a form, so she hands it over, gets it completed under the cheerful guidance of this lad (I say lad, he was well in his fifties), and me mam says ""Oh, she wants to open one too.""

So he turns to me. ""Are you over sixteen?""

""I'm twenty one.""

Cue the embarrassment. I didn't really mind. It somehow made the birthday real to me.

The meal was lovely, at the Three Horseshoes (in Cowpen Bewley, pronounced more like 'coupon' for all you unfortunate souls unfamiliar with Teesside. Everyone gets it wrong). Turns out Ashleigh's no longer vegetarian but will only eat meat if it doesn't look like it came from an animal, unless it's beef because she has a raging carnivorous hunger for beef.

Saw Auntie Myrna in town, and she kept us talking for ages. You know what she's like, bless her. Uncle Bob's basically screwed, but he's been hanging by a thread for years now. Like, since he was born. He's driving her mad. And her two sons... well. Let's leave that one unsaid. Then another great Billingham matriarch joined the party, and the tallying of grandchildren began! (Mrs McLeod won that round) And the comparisons of illnesses! (Auntie Myrna has Uncle Bob. There is no beating that, not if Mrs McLeod was dead at the time.)

Visited the grandparents, who had the hump with my dad for being angry at my grandma for telling our Ashleigh about his chest pain (mam thinks it's something to do with his gallbladder or something. Don't ask me. I know nothing.), so THAT was a fun visit. Eked out as much conversation as I could, had a cuppa, did a few magazine puzzles and tried not to let the atmosphere turn me to stone...

Saw Melinda and the kiddiwinks, but not Jess because she has A Social Life, got leaped on by a muddy Ruby (the dog. Hey Daryl and Rose, guess what everyone likes to sing to her? And she bloody well howls along with the ""WHOOO-OOOO-OOOO-OOO-OOOOO-OOOOOOAAAAAAA""). Despite my mother's vow to avoid Uncle Andrew, he came around too, but Abigail was there so it was bearable.

And now I am here! Got on the internet to throw myself passionately into the virtual arms of Joe and Laura, and checked my email only to find that Uemura Saho of the Gakushuuin Kendo Club found me on mixi. It has truly been the best birthday EVER.

I survived the week from hell.

I struggled through the writing exam, fucking up the essay question as I did so, I memorised my speech just enough to rattle through it with the help of a half page of sparse notes, I spoke pretty coherently on all the unprepared questions and bullshitted through Genji (which woman is my favourite? I dunno. I guess the ghost lady one was cool, but was that Lady Rokujo or Aoi? Also Suetsumuhana is hilarious, and Ukifune I like for sticking to her guns against all the pressure, though she really should give Kaoru a chance. I finally decided on Utsusemi, because a) hers was the only name I could remember, and b) I could explain the backstory of her name, which honestly seemed to impress/interest Morimoto-sensei)

Today I rushed through the ending of my two essays, which could have been much better, but fuck you if you think I was slacking at all this week. I dragged myself up to hand them in, and I honestly thought my brain would just up and quit. I can't think. I can't do anything else. My brain just digs its heels in and says ""NO MORE."" Maybe I'm not cut out for university.

Also my gigantic painful breasts have finally culminated in a period, which makes me feel crappy, and I woke up the last couple of mornings with a sore throat, and I can feel the cold coming on behind it.

All in all, I think I've earned a fucking rest.

In more positive news, I've started writing some Phoenix/Edgeworth/Iris porn designed for affectionate teasing of all three characters, and I've completed Zelda and started Trauma Centre.

It was all pretty standard fare till I got to the essay. Then one of my worst fears (the others being doing an unprepared presentation and having no money when I get to the till in a shop) came true.

I didn't understand the one key word of the question.

I guessed like a motherfucker.

I finally plucked up the courage to look that word up this morning.

Apart from that the world hasn't ended, and apart from writing myself into a couple of corners I'm pretty happy. FInished my grammar exercises and did a fiche de culture yesterday (about sans-papiers. Only look them up if you enjoy righteous anger :D) Gonna write another one today about Lille and possibly one after that if I can be arsed about... something else?

Am de-yeasted for the most part. Don't know? You probably don't want to.

Got a big fuck-off tank for the snails, because the old one's starting to look pretty small for them. They still look happy, but I'd rather pre-empt it. And if they're shagging each other (turns out the white growth was most probably a love dart from Toshi to Souji, so Toshi is still on top and my OTP is unsullied XD) then they'd probably like a nice place to lay. And compost has come back for planting season. And Laura and a lass she knows are interested in eggs if/when they come, and I could always nick a couple for myself. Especially considering the colossal size of the new tank.

Mike finished Zelda so I got my DS back and am now avidly solving murders as before. Hurrah! Mia's awesome. I still love the tone of the dialogue. It's like they got someone with a sense of humour to translate it, and it is brilliant.

Watched Happy Together with one of Daryl's classes which was... weird but strangely lovely. My French cinema class has really honed my tastes. As in, I actually know *what* I like now. So last night we all watched In The Mood For Love, and oh, Wong Kar-wai's cinematography is gorgeous. The colour, the framing, the one-sided shots of conversations, the little abstract things, the dead time, the soundtrack and daydream sequences, oh God I must marry him now. Hey, Joe, come on over and let's watch beautiful films together again? I miss those days. The Life Aquatic and Brotherhood and 2046 will always remind me of you <3

Everything's pretty much love and rainbows for me now. After the initial ""OH FUCK WHUT?"" period everything's fallen into a neat little schedule.

(Hee, OLIVIA. This song is part of my Yonec soundtrack. Muldumarec and Naevana make such a beautiful couple. Don't worry. He's here, waiting for you. She's waiting for you, too.)"

They say that the animals know, but the snails didn't really give a toss one way or the other :P Souji's still awake, so I just got him out to make sure he's ok (apart from having grown to a monstrous size). I looked at his little face, and suddenly thought ""Does he have three antennae?!"" I looked closer.

Nope.

There was a little white growth on his neck. ""Has he hurt himself? Oh dammit, what kind of terrible mother figure am I?""

Nope.

""OH. OH, THAT.""

Turns out little Souji's hit sexual maturity at last and may or may not have wanted to make sweet, sweet love to my hand. This explains why the boys have been cuddling more than usual, I guess.

"event","Long gap, but I've been busy with work. ...Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

Got up to see the lunar eclipse last night, but it was way too cloudy :( Grr. Stupid clouds.

And now I'm going to take this opportunity to wax poetic about my current mini-project, so don't read if you can't be arsed with it.

Some of you may know (because let's be honest, it's not as if I'm quiet about it) that I'm trying to rework the medieval French Lay of Yonec by Marie de France. I couldn't help it, really. As Rose suggested to me once when I was bewailing the long and difficult task that is writing An Autumn of Wolves (Shinsengumi epic), ""Maybe the stories choose you."" This one definitely did.

We had to read Yonec and another lay called Equitan, both by Marie de France, for my medieval French module. I was pretty blah about Equitan. I mean, it was pretty amusing, but it didn't grab me like Yonec did. Well. Muldumarec. He is awesome.

THIS IS HIS STORY.

<lj-cut text=""Synopsis"">

Marie de France first tells us that she's going to tell us about Yonec's parents. His mother, unnamed but I have called her Naevana so there, was married off to an old guy (who I have conveniently named Olethreutes) who wants to have babies with her to continue his lineage, and she is locked up in a tower for seven years because he thinks she'll be unfaithful to him. The only other person who sees her is Olethreutes' sister. Who I have named Maera. Seriously. There are only two named characters in the whole thing.

Naevana is miserable, as one might guess. One day she goes over to the window and complains loudly about her fate, cursing everyone who had a hand in confining her to the tower and wishing for some gallant knight or something to whisk her away. The next thing she knows, a huge hawk soars into the room. She's scared, but it tells her not to be, and transforms into a man. This is Muldumarec.

He reveals that he's loved her from afar but couldn't come to her until she expressed a desire to see him. She asks him if he's Christian (Olethreutes banned her from going to church) and he recites his Credo to her and even shapeshifts into her form and takes communion. Naevana is overjoyed and they passionately declare their love for one another. They have sex. It's good. Just before Muldumarec leaves, he tells her that whenever Naevana calls for him, he'll be there within the hour. However, if they continue to pursue their love, Maera will betray them and his death will become inevitable. Naevana appears to blissfully ignore this part. Bless.

The betrayal will come sooner than they both think. After meeting Muldumarec, Naevana is so happy, and begins to take care of her appearance again, that Olethreutes suspects something's wrong.

Please allow me to interrupt and say that if the happiness of your wife means something is amiss, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.

He sends Maera to hide in Naevana's room and see what's going on, while he goes out hunting. Naevana calls Muldumarec again, they probably have more mindblowing sex, and he leaves. Maera tells Olethreutes about the hawk-man. Olethreutes starts to make traps. He eventually settles on iron spikes, or arrows or something, and places them by the window.

Next time Naevana calls him, he's wounded by one of these spikes, and she finds him bleeding all over her bed. He comforts her as best he can (after a little accusation, but who can blame him, really?) and flies out of the window. Naevana, devastated, follows. Apparently, it's a miracle she didn't kill herself, but she didn't, and she begins to follow the trail of blood Muldumarec leaves behind him...

That's basically Part One. Or at least that's where I'm dividing my version, purely because I haven't really thought much further ahead.

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""What I'm planning on doing with it"">

It's full of Christian imagery (Muldumarec coming in the form of a bird like the Holy Spirit, his whole saviour aspect, the use of religion as proof of his sincerity etc) but I've decided to mostly leave them alone. And I've used technology as the same kind of catch-all as magic in the original. Muldumarec has wings and can fly? Oh, technology. I'm not explaining its intricate workings though. I kind of want it to have a fairytale feel, so there are things that are just happening because. I hope it's represented in the language as well, though I have a tendency to get a little overexplanatory for fairytale style. All the same, I'm trying.

I also want to strike a balance between realism and blatant non-realism. So without going into all the fun detail of Naevana being fucked-up from lack of human contact for seven years and not having gone outside in all that time (""Prince Charming didn't take Rapunzel to rehab"", said Laura, and quite right she is), I want to keep her actions pretty in character. This means that I don't want them to just randomly fall in love because he's built up an idealised image of her/pities her, and because he's the first nice man she's seen in seven years. I want to make them both likeable. I want him to be protective and gentle and I want her to be not *just* beautiful. Obviously she's going to be shy. But I don't want that to come across as damsel-in-distress.

"event","I AM SO TIRED.

Stayed up retardedly last night. Not retardedly lat. Just retardedly. Went to my 10am lecture to realise I hadn't watched the film yet, so I watched that afterwards. It was Pierrot Le Fou. It was brilliant and awesome and I need to buy it. I love the stylistic features, and I love the characters(even though they're both mad in their own ways) and I love the poetry of the words and the cinematography, and I am in complete hopeless love with the domestic scene where she sings to herself while making breakfast, walking past the unexplained dead body.

In the lecture people talked about the fractured time line. I don't think it was fractured. To me it flowed like all the long shots and the gorgeous feel of continuity, but I guess that at times, yes, the timeline jumped around. Also they mentioned the colours. Yeah, a couple of times it went into reds, blues, whites, but nothing too horrific. If anything, it was just more vibrant than the other films we've seen so far. Un Long Dimanche De Fiancailles was very... sepia-toned, and things like Les 400 Coups were pretty darkly lit. Pierrot Le Fou shone. It was the perfect embodiment of transitivity.

And the characters = fabulous. I am in love with Marianne. She's so wild, like the fox on the dinner table, and violent and full of emotions. She goes her own way when she wants to, tells him she loves him at the slightest provocation even when abandoning him, without listening to Ferdinand, and her childlike mannerisms and temper provide contrast to his coolness and casual cruelty.

Gorgeous film.

And the end...

OH the end. After my original ""WAIT WHAT?"" it settled down into ""oh...""

Someone needs to watch it so I can bounce and ramble some more.

Colouring in B is for Beep, the two husky puppies beeping each other's noses. Also I have discussion next. I can't be bothered. Do I LOOK like I have anything to discuss?! No! LET ME GO DO MY LISTENING EXERCISES. I'll get at least one of those done and finish the fiche de vocab. Then I can die.

No, wait, I have to watch In The Mood For Love!

I AM IN THE MOOD FOR FILM!"

Thanks for that.

It's not like it would have been nice to have a rest, or anything.

Also, stupidly, I realised I had some French exercises to prepare for... Monday! So I did the first lot, then looked at the second and realised ""But I don't *KNOW* an adjective or past participle that can replace ""qui n'a pas"" in that context. Either I need the 'qui' or I need to cut the 'de' from the beginning of the second part. Maybe I'm being stupid? I don't know. I guess it doesn't matter so much if I get it all fabulously right. My lessons are for learning, after all. So that'll be fun. Done almost all of the last of my fucking fiches de culture. Napoleon. Oh yes. Thought I should really do some of the listening exercises, considering I need three more. So I went onto the French radio site, and found an interesting little bit on ""nerds, geeks and no-lifes."" It's retardedly long. And transcription is RETARDEDLY HARD. Maybe I should just gist-comprehension this one. Transcriptions can fuck off. The fucking radio presenter has no idea what he's saying half the time, and EVERYTHING ENDS WITH ""ER/AI/AIENT/EZ/E-acute/E-acuteS/E-acuteE/E-acuteES"".

*made of hatred for French language*

The most irritating thing is, I can genuinely understand the gist of what they're saying. But when you have to write it down there's a load that my mind just bleeps over because it's boring or the presenter's stuttering again. In a transcription, alas, you cannot bleep. I am le sad.

My bed is lonely without someone else in it.

And someone's fucking car alarm went off right outside my room. Hey, neighbours. If you can hear a car alarm and no one switches it off after a while, MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT IS YOURS AND TURN IT OFF. I know you could hear it too, you bastards. And if someone was actually nicking the car, then perhaps they could do me the favour of just driving OFF with the fucking thing more quickly. At least 15 minutes of sad Danni. I thought maybe it was our fire alarm and I'd mistaken it, but no. And as soon as I was awake, I realised that New Flatmate Boy was having some kind of wild 2am party in the kitchen. Right next to my room. Of course.

Ben, come back. You've taken all my luck with you... ;_;

</grumpy old man Danni>

Seeing Ben after 5 years of avoiding him and being too scared to seriously entertain the prospect of seeing him again was brilliant. It went exactly as I'd expected, of course. But it was ok. It's different this time.

He told me I was vague. I guess I am... I am right now, anyway. There's not much to say in words, and what little there is sounds pretty cliche.

Nothing has changed.
I believe every secret thing he says.
I still hate train stations more often than not.
I'm wearing his torque because he left it here.
I really want to see him again.
A lot.
Not with quite as much intensity as the first time, but I don't expect to get that absolutely submerged feeling back again ever. I think it only happens once to everyone.

I should go before I dissolve into a pile of sickening fluff ^_^"

3) Read Fandom Wank. There's another pompous-on-both-sides argument about fanfiction going on. I'm no longer in the scene (not that I was ever really that superpopular; my fandoms were small and my writing uncontraversial) so I don't really care for either side. What caught my eye was the dickhead who said ""fanfiction doesn't even involve physical description so it's not real literature, hahahaaa"" or something to that effect. After the gut reaction of ""Fuck you, you colossal twatmonger. My fabulous writings rarely include physical description, because I COMPLETELY LACK A VISUAL IMAGINATION,"" I realised that I've never noticed that before. In fact, it's the overabundance of horrible physical description that most people have an issue with, in fandom.

Had to be careful though - I almost spelt my name wrong first :P"

"event","Firstly I forget my phone charger, so I have to go get one today (call me etc on my old phone if you need me till then).

Secondly I'm horribly not sure if the little place on the way to the town even *does* ringbinding.

Thirdly I spazzed out because I fucked up the copy of my short dissertation that I brought back from home, and then I realised I had one here. THANK GOD. I saved it wrong, or something, and a big chunk in the middle was random letters and symbols. I was writing my contents page (I freaked out about that and the title page too, till I realsied I had a document telling me what to do), saw it, and screamed ""FUCK NO!""

Fourthly, I just ran out of printer credits.

I hate you, Leeds.

So I'm waiting for them to put the credits into my account, so I can get this thing ringbound and forget about it forever.

Within 30 minutes, they said.

Oh dear God I want this to be over."

"event","Have done nothing since Christmas. Am a lazy, shameful person.

I forgot all of the things I need to revise for my exams from.
I haven't even *looked* at my dissertation thing since I threw the first draft at my 'supervisor'. As long as it's in decent English, I'm getting it bound and handing it in.
I have exams. That I have not and cannot revise for until the 4th. All of those things I was worrying about before we broke up for Christmas are back.

Saw Shaun on Boxing Day, and he seemed much happier. Hmm.

Uncle Bob's still hanging in there. Apparently he was borderline pneumonia, but he's the kind of person who, even though he's so frail that you could blow on him and he'd fall over, has to keep on hanging on just to *be* frail and complain about things.

Sigh.

On the good hand, my dad's family (besides the relationship of my grandparents and the constant concern for my grandad's state of mental health which one day will become more than a joke between us) seem to be doing fine. The Irish lot are still mad, and came over along with Alix and Nicky for a day, which was nice. Our Pat was complaining about the state of television. Voici.

""And these nature programmes! About snakes! On Christmas Day! Who wants to watch snakes on Christmas? I wouldn't mind if they put some kind of action in it, like Indiana Jones! At least we see some action before he jumps into the pit! And he gets out alive!""

Etc.

Also, I have possible contacts in South East Asia courtesy of the businessman of the family, for which I will ever be eternally grateful. I guess this is how the other half live, eh Jackie? Also Alix is at Cambridge University. My God. The family's not a lost cause after all.

There was a really interesting conversation between my grandma and John (some kind of uncle-cousin-removed-something?) about leaving Enniskillen, which I'd always kind of seen as some lovely Irish paradise. Well, I had Billingham to compare it with! Everything's some kind of lovely paradise compared to Billingham. Neither of them would ever EVER go back there to live. Took my grandma fifteen years to get over it, but now she'd never go back. John was glad to leave.

So maybe Billingham's not the worst hell hole in the universe.

And when I leave, I can not regret it just as much as they don't."

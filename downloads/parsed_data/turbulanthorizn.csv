(written about someone) and he was sooo happy as i stressed before, and right as we got off the phone he called me back really upset and cold sounding saying ""i can't come and i gotta go bye..."" this makes me even more stressed out cuz i don't know what's going on and we have a show tomorrow and we haven't ran through our songs in quite some time... arrgghhh!! but whatever... this just really sucks...

<b><u>Midnight Visions</b></u>
in the dark
these eyes can see forever
the world comes in focus
your face flashes blue
metamorphic ideas
of a somatic philosophy
time doesn't pass
when i'm thinkning of you
the thoughts blend
into a memory mosaic
nothing decays...
no one leaves...
nobody dies...
if only dreams weren't such liars...

"event","i forgot how good narcissus is. i just downloaded a song off their new album and it's fucking sweet. but aside from that. this has been an awkward weekend so far. last night at the football was bad. i just felt like shit for some reason. it got better though. i found this freshmen boy who i hugged in the hall during the school day and said ""i love freshmen boys"" and i stuck my trombone in his ass. then i spent the rest of the night chasing him. he was so scared i was going to rape him. it was hillarious.  the bus ride home was interesting as well. i made out with some girl named megan because all these people were daring me too. she's not ugly. just really ditzy. and a slut. she couldn't kiss though. i did all the fucking work she didn't do anything... o well. when we got back to the school i put on nin in our stereo and got all sad because i felt really alone and i felt like everything was fake etc. everyone around me was feeling bad too like bethany and josh, especailly kaylie. kaylie's adult friend is dying and she is really bummed. i felt bad... so i gave her a kiss goodbye.... then when i got home i wrote something for the first time in over a month. it's not too good. then i got all sad and played ""the funeral march"" on guitar for a long time and went to sleep. today was a long day as well. i sat around and played guitar and redyed my hair. when band pracitce time arrived it kicked ass. we redid the band room and now there's all this room and there's carpet. we played very well for not having played in two weeks. after we practiced we picked up britney and bethany and went out and had a great time at taco bell. after that we played for britney for she missed out on our show. which reminds me. we have another show sunday september 21st at the voodoo. at 7 o clock... everyone has to be there on time...  muahha. more details later...

"event","hello... i haven't updated in awhile. things have been up and down like always... a brief summary is that abby and i had a fun day the other driving around and getting applications to arabica.  but, i learned that my step-dad is starting some really disturbing and <b>SICK</b> and i mean truly <b><u>INSANE</b></u> stuff. one of his acts involves murdering a kitten and throwing it in our bushes. but aside from that. other things have came about. like the show. as many of you know our first show was last night. it was a fucked up day that's for sure. we got to the voodoo late so we thought it would be crowded with other bands, thus we wouldn't be playing.  however, when we got there there was just one other band, and it was their first show. they were crazy ass guyz in their twenties, really nice and hopsitable though. they went on first. i beleive they were called ""thank god it isn't van halen,"" which is a creative name, but yeah very weird. their set wasn't bad. good guitar playing. their drummer and vocalist sucked sadly. o well. not bad for a first performance. by then a whole lot of our friends were showing up. when it was time for us to take the stage, we were all very nervous and unsure about how to set up the stage. we had so much fucking equipment lol. twice as much as the other band.  when it was time for sound check disaster struck, the tube amp wasn't working. luckily the sound check guy was really nice and was patient enough to discover the chord was blown.  he gave us a spare and we were ready to rock! muahaha. our first three songs went over really well, much better than expected. and by then we had at least 30 people just for us which was really cool.  then we tried the cover of nin's ""something i can never have."" i didn't sing it, but i screamed on back up for the chorus'. poor josh sang it, and he learned the whole song in two days. steve also played a ghetto ass keyboard through a shitty amp so it didn't sound too great. the audience seemed to enjoy it, but said that josh singing it was kind of annoying. after that we played our instrumental song, but i fucked up really bad. the guitar was out of tune pretty bad, so i just had to play through it... steve's solo was also pretty out of key as well. we had mixed reactions to that song. people said it was good minus the solo, and other people were indifferent. we closed with ""eternal youth"" which went over really really well and people really liked the song. after the show we all went out to eat at stake n shake with like a billion people. all good times. when i got home, kevin and ben stayed over which was an interesting time.  ben apparently got some cigs from various people however due to him wanting to be a supid addict he smoked all but one. kevin told him to light it up but we couldn't find a lighter. once i found my lighter we all smoked it. it was really funny cuz ben would suck in really deep, but he wasn't really ""inhaling"" (similar to some other people i know of hahaha) so we told him too, and he coughed so hard and got really light headed. he literally paniced to the point where he thought he was dying. it was funny. after that kevin and i finished it and we all fell asleep after a fun and crazy night...

"event","yesterday was really good. it had been a long time since i had such a good day. i was planning to spend the whole day sitting in front of my computer doing homework and being sad, until josh called. josh had the bright idea that out of nowhere he was going to have a pool party at his house. one thing led to another and mike mcgregor who is this incredibly cool and funny senior showed up at my house to take me up there. he's one of those half wigger, half just plain kids and we hopped into his car that he pimped out with neon lights and a fast engine and all of that shit, and we hit the freeway. since he races his car with the thugs in akron, we topped out on the interstate at about 110. it was fucking scary, but a lot of fun.  when we arrived at josh, josh said like no one was invited lol... it ended up being me, josh, mike mcgregor, a junior named tim muir, and josh's ex girlfriend bethany. so we go down to the pool and there was nothign but old fat people doing calisthetics... it was so fucking disgusting. lol. we drove the old people out of the pool by talking loudly about gynecology and things. it was really gross cuz the pool water didn't taste like chlorine, but salt. so everyone said it tasted like semen. as the party dwindled and tim left, mike said he had to go to work at regal, so he invited josh and i to go see a movie. we agreed. once he left, josh drove bethany to a bday party, but first we drove her to wal mart. josh and i almost repeatedly got kicked out for i had a bright pink fishnet shirt on with nothing over it or under it. we then went to the toy aisle and started playing basketball and some old guy yelled at us... after that i grabbed a football and screamed ""sports"" and said ""josh, go long duuuuudddeee,"" and he did. he caught the ball and surprisingly spiked it really fucking hard and it flew up and hit like a million shelves. after being banned from the toy department, we moved to the car stereo area and cranked up all the systems.. we got repremanded for that as well.  last but not least, after playing with thongs and bras for a good half hour, we took bethany to her party.  then josh and i drove to seth's picked him up, and floored it to taco bell. it was great getting called gay by a million people for wearing my shirt. and what surprise awaited us at taco bell? mike mcgregor! he was there on his break. so he told us to go the the movies. after we got our food, seth josh and i floored it back to seth's and practiced for a little bit. by then it was 9:30 so we floored it to the movie theatre. we realized that the only things playing were rated r, and we had no money. mike mcgregor saw us and was just like, ""go on and walk in, we here at regal entertainment group don't give a shit..."" we saw ""swimming pool"" which was the dumbest softcore porn ever. lol. seth covered his eyes during the sex scenes too. pussy muahahaa... once the movie ended, andrew toppin, another marching  band senior, and mcgregor were planning to do something to the marching band field. apparently, the had a trashbag full of popcorn covered in urine, and then i see josh and mike mcgregor running out of the theatre with a huge cardboard display for the movie ""the medallion."" i ran into the parking lot with seth to watch them stuff it in andy's truck... i hopped with mcgregor and we floored it to the highschool. we dumped the popcorn all over the marching field, and propped the display up on mr. n's tower... it was great to do something illegal. this morning, there was geese shit all over the field from the gesse eating the urine popcorn... hehee.. it was great to watch 200+ people walk home with shit shoes... muahaha...

"event","hello. today was the show at seth's house. it was very interesting. full of complications and badness... of course. but we played, and had a good time. i'm not sure if the audience had a good time, but o well. saw julia and sarah for the first time in a long time. that was nice. then my parents gave me a huge rant about how they think i'm suicidal... i don't know if i am truly or not. i mean, i don't like my life right now or myself, but doing anything drastic as far as drugs or cutting or any of that dumb shit is totally retarded. so basically i just sit here.  i don't know who i am anymore really. i just live. cuz i guess that's all i can really do.  many people say that all i do is point the blame and beat around the bush, i avoid my problems. and other people say i worry about my problems too much and need to let go... i just know that there is only one person in this world who ever made everything make complete sense. and that person still does it. i thank them for it..... i just feel so alone all the time and i don't know why. i wish i would hear from valary. i don't like her too much or anything, but she's nice and fun to talk to. i want her to move in with me. just so i would always have someone around. i know i'm just ranting... and this entire entry makes no sense. i'm sorry... i'm off to kill myself at radiohead i guess.

"event","the other day wasn't too bad... in the day time. i got see eric panzner for the first time in a long time. and probably the last... ever... =(... the kid was so fucking cool. he gave me a copy of his cd that he made. he's a strange kid. he released his first cd when he was a freshmen. and i have one of the only 100 copies. muahhaa. but his new cd under his new name ""zain issac"" entitled ""learn to sleep well and rest your weary eyes,"" is so fucking good. it sounds like a great blend of radiohead, coldplay, and your favorite acoustic guitar songs. i'm just so envious of this kid. he's like the trent reznor of the indie rock scene, on the cd he plays every instrument. drums, guitar, bass, piano, sings, even play banjo. it's so fucking insane. but yeah. then the blackout hit and i wanted to die. there's all kinds of shit going on with my family that i'm paranoid about and stuff. as well as various other elements/people that are making me really sad and stressed out. and i felt like shit so i snuggled in the dark with juliaz blanket and cried like the lead singer of dashboard confessional.  when the power came back i needed to talk to someone and then remembered that i couldn't call elicia. eric was still at work so i couldn't call him and i knew annie wasn't home. i called juliaz cell phone but she didn't pick up. so i fell asleep. this morning i was really pissed off cuz my mom threw away my eyeliner as well as annie's fucking eyeliner sharpener.  i'm angry at so many things. tis really shitty. but. of course i had marching band. today was so fucking hot i thought i was going to die.  however, i've been occupying my song to learning the solo to ""the beauty and the beast"" theme song. muahaha. it's so stupid and i'm a loser. but it keeps me occupied....

<marquee>""i can't wait till we go home to our sorry states and kryptic tones, we'll close the windows, bolt the locks and hope ...and did i mention that i'm paranoid for the songs you sing are null and void... the melodies do not reflect the tune...i wait for phonecalls and their not coming... this was not the first of my last chances to see you go... it's all the way down. i'm all the way down..""</marquee>"

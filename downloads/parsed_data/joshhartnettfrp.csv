"event","I just wanted to post and let everyone know that I have to leave the island. Its not something I want to do or am happy about, but some RL things have come up that are seriously important and will be taking up most if not all of my time for quite a while. I know this has happened at a most inopportune time for me and Gwen, but thankfully I have her support with this decision. She has been wonderfully through all of it and I couldnt be more greatful. She is truly an amazing woman. I will be leaving my email open in case anyone needs to or would like to email me. 
Thats Josh_Hartnett_frp@yahoo.com            
Thank you everyone for the great times and memories I had here on the island. I consider all of you my friends.

She's outside right now getting some air, trying to feel better. And Im lounging in bed, just being a loaf. I think she thinks I went back to sleep, but I took this moment to update. ::smiles softly:: We have had a great time here. It sad that we only have one day left. But tomorrow we head off to Walt Disney World, and I couldnt be happier. I was thinking for today we would take this Jeep safari I have heard so much about and then I was thinking about taking her on the helicopter tour they have here. They said its really beautiful, it gives you a chance to look down on the whole island. I was sorta thinking also about going horseback riding, but with Gwen feeling sick and all, maybe we should put that off, and just go see them. ::grins:: The horses here are beautiful. Perfect, even. LIke the kind you see in the movies and in paintings. Gorgeous animals. Well, I think I might take another quick nap while shes out there, and then get our day started if shes up to it. ::closing my journal and huddling under the covers, falling back asleep::"

"event","Well today is day three of our trip to Bora Bora, tomorrow unfortunately is our last, but then we are off to out second part of the honeymoon...Walt Disney World. Sugar has never been there before and it is a place very dear to me and I want to experience being there with her. I cant wait to see how she likes it. I hope she loves it. And its good to get Little One there too, Daddy will be bringing her there alot. And its never too early to get started. ::laughs::
This morning we slept in later than we had planned, but that worked out just fine ::grins:: SPent some time in our bungalow just enjoying each other, Gwen is just so beautiful. Its hard to let go of her for just one second. After that we walked to a nearby village and had breakfast at a little stand, just some fruit, nothing too heavy. Gwen has been starting too feel a little nauseous lately, so we thought it best to take it easy this morning. After we ate, we went on a four wheel drive safari which was just incredible. We made sure it wasnt going to be too turbulent for her before we took part, but it was a really smooth trip for the most part. Its really neat. Its a two and a half hour tour that brings you to these valleys and mountains that you can climb and explore that are only accessible by taking these vehicles. It was so beautiful. It offers a great view of the island from many perspectives. We got some great shots, we will have to post them later. After that we went on a Catamaran cruise. Now that was exciting! It was only about 40 minutes but boy! can those boats go fast, and its actually pretty scary at times. But it was an experience. ::grins:: Gwen was screaming so loudly when the boat goes up on its side. It was so cute. Well, thats really it for now. Gwen is taking a nap, and i think I might go join her before going out tonight. ::closes journal and walks over to the bed, climbing in beside Gwen and wrapping my arms around her pulling her closer to me::"

"event","Today was our first full day in Bora Bora, and it was amazing. We woke bright and early and had breakfast delivered to us by boat. Its a really neat experiance. After breakfast we went for a dip in our freshwater pool to help wake us up, and then I surprised Gwen. I had rented a boat and a provate island, so we could spend most of the day snorkeling together, just the two of us. It was amazing. I got to touch a mana ray, and we saw some sea turtles and all sorts of fish and corals. I never imagined that the oceans were so beautiful you know? You hear about it, but to actually experiance it yourself, its just breathtaking. After we got out of the water, I brought her to the other side of the island where I had had a picnic set up for her, all on a huge sky blue and lavender blanket. It was really romantic, just the two of us, under the huge blue shy, just holding each other and doing nothing. The world was ours. It was incredible. AFter spending some time on the island, romping around the beach and whatnot ::grins::, we headed back to land and took a glass bottomed boat tour which was really neat. The whole floor of this boat is glass and you can see everything under you. We saw a few sharks even, it was so neat. And being able to talk to some other vacationers was fun too because it gave us ideas of what we could do the rest of the time we are here. After the boatride, we went to a small village just a little bit away from our bungalows and shopped for some souveneirs, and some gifts for our Little One. The locals are really nice and they are willing to talk about almost anything with you, which was also helpful in finding out what is fun to do around here. After that we went back to our bungalow and took showers to wash off all the sand we had acquired from earlier, and then just stayed inside doing honeymoon stuff. ::grins devilishly:: Tonight I thought we would just order dinner and have it boated over here, and spend the rest of the night indoors...or maybe in our pool. Havent decided yet. Hey, maybe both. Well I have to get goig, Gwen is calling for me from the hottub."

(Thank you Lance for letting us use your private jet, it was a wonderful time and a smooth flight) It gave us some time to talk about what we had planned for our honeymoon and what he had planned for our future, and I was able to catch a nap as well, which was nice, since I spent so much time last night packing and whatnot. As the plane was landing we caught glimpses of Bora Bora and it is simply beautiful. The water is so crystal clear, I have never seen anything like it before, its really awesome. The sand is so white and the sun was shining, its heaven here, I can tell already. We are staying in a bungalow which is set further away from the cluster of them, so we have alot of privacy ::grins:: and our own little beach, which is very fun. There is also a freshwater pool right near us which we took advantage of right away and went swimming in nothing but our birthday suits. ::beams:: My Sugar has an amazing body and she is so graceful in the water. She continues to always take my breath away. After going swimming, we finally decided to unpack and go exploring. There are a couple of really neat patches of water to go snorkling which is definately something we are interested in doing, and alot of little hidden coves and ""love nooks"" which really add to the romance of this whole place. We havent done alot so far because we wanted this first day for ""relaxing"" and what not ::grins devilishly:: But tomorrow we will definately take advantage of all this island has to offer. The only real thing I have planned for tonight is a candlelite dinner right on the water for my Sugar. I just want to be able to look at her gorgeous face in the candlelight and tell her how much I love her. She really is my everything. I am so glad I am here with her. Its perfect. Well, Gwen is motioning for me and I cant keep the missus waiting for me ::grins:: Ill update more later."

"event","Well the past two days have been very busy and very exciting. Thursday night Gwen and I finally made it official. Gwen and I were married during a lovely ceremony which almost all of our friends were able to attend, which made it all the more special to us. Abbie, it was especially wonderful that you were able to attend. It made the evening perfect, it wouldnt have been the same without you. The wedding was followed by a beautiful reception at Lance and Kim's home. Kim, you did an amazing job, everything was picture perfect. 
Tonight Gwen and I had our first pre-natal appointment. We found out we are just a little over 5 weeks along, so our Little One is so far expected to make her big entrance on Labor Day. As Gwen said, what a perfect day to have a baby. ::laughs:: I had alot of questions, and Dr Karter happily answered them, but there are still so many things that I dont know. But I have some time yet before I have to know.
::looking around the bedroom, and my clothes scattered about:: Gwen, the beautiful woman she is, is already packed. Me, on the other hand, have no clue what to bring. I dont know why I am being so picky, normally I wouldnt care what I looked like. But it is our honeymoon, and I want everything to be perfect for her. She has done so much for me and our relationship since we have met, she works so hard in so many ways, I want to give her this honeymoon as a time to relax, reflect, and just enjoy herself. I love her, and I just hope everything goes smoothly. 
Our flight leaves bright and early at 5 am. ::cringes at the sound of such an early hour:: But Tahiti isnt a hop skip and a jump away so I will be able to catch a few extra Zzz's on the way there hopefully. We are staying in a really neat Bungalow which is built right about the water. In some spots on  the floor you can see right through to the water, its really incredible. Ill post more about this once we get there and get settled. RIght now though, I have to start packing, or I will never get done by the time we have to leave for the airport."

Definately creative. ::laughs again:: I dont know where they came up with some of that stuff, but if anything, it will keep Gwen and I...entertained. ::grins:: To Justin, Paul, and everyone else that could not make it, thank you for thinking about me and wanting to be there. That truly means alot. I know during the week may not have been the best time for such a party, but it was alot of fun and I wish you all could have been there. The night was also good because I was able to meet some new guys on the island who I hadnt had a chance to meet yet. All in all, it was a great time. Oh, and Justin, I was thinking about naming her Justine. ::dies:: 
Well, all there is for me to do now is try and relax and make sure the honeymoon is all in order, my vows are all in order, and I am all in order. ::takes a deep breath:: Actually maybe I will go for a run on the beach, so I can try to calm these nerves of mine. Hope to see everyone tonight!"

Excited, anxious, nervous, thrilled...too many feelings for words. My life seems to be falling into place, and I couldnt be happier. After being away for a few weeks (thank you Buffy, the trip was wonderful. My brother and I had a great time) it is nice to be home, to be able to see familiar faces again, and be with those who mean the world to me. As much fun as my vacation was, I was counting the days until I could be home again, with my Sugar, and our ""Little one"". ::smiles:: I cant believe that I am actually going to be a father. This has been a dream of mine for so long now, and its finally coming true. Its just so hard to believe. Im incredibally excited of our little one's arrival, I just wish it didnt take nine months. ::laughs:: I dont know if I can wait that long. I have a little feeling in me that our little one is going to be the little girl I have always dreamed of. I dont know why, exactally, its just this feeling I have. But you know what? If he is a boy, I will be equally as thrilled, and proud, and overjoyed. Im in love with little one already. Every night I kiss Gwen's stomach goodnight. ::sighs happily:: It will be amazing once she has started to show. I think it will make this amazing happening seem all the more real. 
Getting back to our wedding, I have asked Buffy to stand with me at the service. To be my best-lady if you will. Since of course, she cannot be a best man. ::chuckles:: She has happily accepted and I am thrilled. She has meant so much to me this whole time I have been here on the island. She has been a true friend and has stuck with me through thick and thin. I just cant see anyone up being there with me right now. She means a great deal to me. Thank you again.
I am still making the final touches on my vows, which I think have come along quite nicely. How do you put how you are feeling into words? Its not easy, but I think I have done a good job, and I hope Gwen loves them. They are words from the heart; my heart to hers. Our honeytmoon arrangements are almost complete as well. This was quite the challenge for me. I am just a big kid who likes to go places and have a great time. But I know that honey moons should be somewhere romantic and special. So I think I have come up with the perfect places. I hope she likes them. 
As for right now, I have a ton of laundry to do and some things to pick up from the store. I hope everyone had a Happy New Year, and continues to have one!"

I do not even know how to put into words how I feel about that woman. She is amazing, she challenges me, makes me think, makes me laugh, make me strive to be a better person. I know spending the rest of my life with her, will make me complete. She is the woman I have always been looking for, and I have finally found her. 
The engagement was special. It was among friends and family at the hotel tonight during the Christmas party, and I wouldnt have wanted it any other way. Our friends our special and mean the world to both of us, and with a special occasion such as this, I didnt feel that it would be right to celebrate it without them there. Thank you all for your congratulations and support. It really means alot to me, and to Gwen as well. 
I look forward to Gwen being my wife, and myself her husband. I look forward to a house full of children running around making us smile, making us laugh...this all seems not just like a dream, but a dream come true. 
Thank you Gwen for being my friend, for being my lover, and for accepting to be my wife. You have made me the happiest man in the world. I love you!"

I know in the end, I will do what is best, but its coming to that decision that is always hard. I have faith that someone will see me through all of this and I will come out a happier and stronger person. ::smiles as Sora and my two kittens hop up onto my bed:: The new kittens certainly like their new home, especially the huge Christmas tree in the living room, which they have made it a habit to climb up and knock all of my ornaments down. ::chuckles:: But they certainly have added some more liveliness to the house, and they keep my busy, which is what I wanted. My semester is almost over, which is another blessing, now I will be able to be here on the island more come the 20th when all of my finals are done. ::sighs looking at the never ending stack of books which now are lying on the floor beside my bed:: I love history, dont get me wrong, but lately when I read, these books are putting me to sleep. I think I have over worked myself. Stayed up too late studying..or something. Lets see...I finally filled out a survey, so check that out if you care to know anything about me ::laughs:: if not, I understand. I know Im not the most exciting male on the island. ::smiles:: Oh! And congratulations Orlando! Im very excited for you. I think Josh is a great name for a boy, dont you? ::smiles:: Well, Im really exhausted, so Im going to catch some shut-eye. More later"

I have been taking some classes on the mainland and finals are coming up so Ive been pretty busy studying and making sure I know what I have to know. After the 20th though Im all done, and will come home, finally for more than just a day at a time. Christmas is my favorite time of year. The music, the friends and family, the snow if you have it...being with the one you love. I want to make Christmas very special for my Angel. To show her that I love her and to thank her for being patient while I get all of this school business worked out. She has been so understanding and I know this has not been easy for her. Sometimes I feel that she would be better off if we took a break, so she wouldnt have to be so lonely..I realise too that that would break my heart. ::looks over at the huge pile of books spread out on my bed and groans:: It seems like it will take me forever to read all of these books.

I have my ornament all ready for when I come home, so I can place it on the tree.

She said yes, but then after some talking we decided it is best to wait awhile before we jump into that so we can get to know each other better. So for anyone who was at the hotel the night we announced the engagement, it is put on hold for now, I just wanted to let everyone know. ::sighs:: I know this is the right thing to do, but everything feels so right when Im with her, like this is how its supposed to be. She makes me feel in ways I never thought I could feel before...I guess I just thought too much with my heart and not with my head. ::chuckles:: But I agree with her, I think it's probably better this way. 
And I guess I also wanted to apologize for my constant shyness whenever Im at the hotel. I have a hard time being very 'crazy' and whatnot. ::grins:: I guess I have to work on that a little bit. One of these days I will be the one who ends up naked...well, we will see. ::laughs::
I feel I need to update more, but it is so hard because I have been so busy. Im hoping that things will calm down more, so I will be able to spend more and more time here and get to know everyone a little better. 
Gwen- I just got back from the grocery store with all of the ingrediants for your pecan pie. Hopefully if I dont get around to it tonight I will have it done by tomorrow. 
Right now though I have a pile of laundry at least as tall as I am. So I think Im going to go and try to attack that first."

I have been thinking about putting a pool in the back of the house. I know the ocean is right there and all, but I love swimming at night, with nothing on. Its just so liberating. And Im not sure if doing that in the ocean in the pitch black of night is a good idea. Well its somthing to look into I suppose.

After the boxes were in it took another two hours to move the furniture into their respectable rooms and then finally the movers were gone. I spent a little while unpacking and cleaning things the best I could on my own, and then Buffy, my lifesaver!, helped me unpack almost the rest of my things. I would have been lost without her. I had no idea where to put anything and she definatley helped me alot! Sometimes I feel that men are completely clueless when it comes to these kinds of things! But I must say, this guy is good at baking pies! I think that may become a weekend hobby for me.

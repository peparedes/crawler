"event","Im sorry to all of my friends that i have not talk to in the last few weeks. Especially britt. Ive been exteremly busy with lots of stuff. 4 or 5 projects, band practice, driving, math, getting ready for my bands show. And my mom is going a bit crazy, and thats no joke. Shes still sane, but she freaks out really easily now. She been taking medication for years and now shes trying to get off of it so thats the cause. When she freaks out then she takes my computer, which means i cant talk to some of you. And im sorry. I miss you and ive been getting comments on myspace about how we havent talked in a while. Im sorry. And im sorry to britt, i havent talked to you in 5 days:(. I have been so fucking busy, my day after school is always so full of stuff i never have a chance for anything anymore. But now that i only have 2 projects instead of 5 hopefully things will change. I love you and if you think im forgetting about you, dont ever think that, because i never will. So new resolution for this week! Talk to more people on msn!!!

I love you all


Anyways my band had our first show last night:D:D:D:D:D
It was amazing and i will never ever forget it. We had to wake up at 6 to go to sound check which sucked, and it wasnt much of a soundcheck haha but it was fun. then we went home practiced for a long time. We just got a new bass player, hes temporary though, so we had to teach him all the shit in two practices haha. Hes really good though so he got it easily. Then we got to slims(the venue) at 4 30, put our stuff down, watched some of the other bands, who sucked ass. THen played at 6:D
And we got the crowed so pumped up! it was amazing. Everyone was moshing some people were dancing:D:D:D:D. Id rather have more dancing haha but its all good. Our guitarist said it well when he said, ""We represented all the hardcore and metal kids there"" It was such a great feeling to do something like that. All the other bands were really shitty emo/indie. And not the good kind. I like that kind of music but they just sucked. The crowd did absolutly nothing to them, and when we got on they went crazy. I loved it and i want to do this for the rest of my life. All the energy we brought on stage was so crazy. I loved it, we messed up a few times and it was because our drummer dropped his stick haha but we fixed it. I love doing this.
O yeah and if you think i sound like an asshole for saying the other bands sucked im sorry. If you heard them you would probably agree. Although the band who played after us were pretty good, they were an all girl band, and were talented. The singer was kinda annoying but they were good.
Anyways now that all thats done,im gonna go do some of my fucking projects   :( britt i call you once you get home ok? I love you
Bye everyone"

its 3 more hours for me
but you guys matter alot to me
alot alot alot alot
so i thought i would say 
Happy New Year
I hope you are all having a wonderful last day of 05
better than mine i hope
hope your having fun
being safe
yeah
Its weird thinking this year is over
it always is
some people might remember what happend last year
i do
all the memories of the year always come flooding back into
its a hard thing to handle
last year
i was feeling mixed emotions
i didnt want the year to end because that would mean it was closer to me moving
but i wanted it to, because of all the shit we went through to get where we were
all the events that had fallen into place to get us where we were seemed unreal to me
it was all just unreal
the year ending
its always unreal
as is it this year
once again im having mixed emotions
i dont want it to end
because im afraid of somethign else ending
but i know i cant prevent that from happening
but i want the next year to come
it means my destination will be closer
i wish that everyone could pick a little time of the year and keep it
keep that one time so you can say you had a happy year
all of it
no one has a whole year of happiness
at least no one i have met
i hope i can one year
maybe next year
i dont know
i dont think so
but a year in the future
im sure it will come one day
i guess i just have to make the best of it, until that day does come
bye everyone
Happy New Year 
I Love You All Very Much, even if i havent talked to you in a while, i love you and i miss you
each and everyone of you, everyone who has been close to me this year, in any way, thank you for everything
i miss you all, my new years resolution is to try to talk to all of you more, i miss you all alot. I always wish i could be back with you. I hope i can soon

"event","Guess fucking what?!?
My band might play our first show in january after break
so far its a big maybe for a few reasons
the biggest we might not be ready
our guitarist is goign on a cruise and our bassist is going somewhere im not sure
so it will be hard to practice
but we'll have a bass player for the first half of break
so thats good
second reason
the band that wants us to play for them
dont have a venue yet
so nothings final at all
but it would be so sweet!!
in case you want to hear who we might play with
 http://www.myspace.com/redh 
thats red handed(punk)
there the ones putting it on
http://www.myspace.com/chkmusic
thats cold hands kill
they go to our school to
good bands
i really hope this goes*( that was for brad) through"

i cant figure out why
i mean i think i know
but im not sure
Im really worried
i feel lonley
like somethings missing
i dont know
maybe i just excited for the break?
i think it was because i was listening to saves the day yesterday, and bright eyes today
i havent listend to saves the day in a loooooooong time
i used to love them in grade 8
i still do
im going to be bored for a bit longer than try to sleep again

we hung out there
watched a hilrious death metal bands video

tim and jimmy were there for a while
hung out fooled around
got seperated
joined back together
then the fun began
we went outside
grabbed our axe bottles and got some bottles of sobe
went to the park
and filled the bottles with axe and then light a match in it
and they were like torches haha it was sweet
we wanted to blow the can up
but we werent in a closed area
so that would have been trouble
then we went back, hung around
filled a bottles with axe to the brim
then put a match in it
and it made a wooshing noise and turned green
it was fun
met up with jason
went to his house fooled around with fire and played a hamock game were you try to knock the other person
off

"event","last night at the show i released so much pent up anger and frustration, it felt amazing. The bands were amazing too. I got two new shirts there pretty sweet, met some new people and saw some people i kind of new. NIV brought a bunch of gangsters though, which was fine until someones nose got broken. which sucked. and then there was almost a fight at the end but luckly there wasnt. It was a fun show overall. Band practice was pretty good, we taught jared his parts and mastered our 2nd song(Hate Us Opress Us)still need to work on the third.
well now im off to get presents for my mom and brittany and get a christmas tree and a hair cut.
britt i called you earlier but you were at work :(, i want to talk to you
ill call you when i get home
bye everyone"

i dont totally feel like  i belong yet
but my band hasnt played a show yet
so once that happens im sure
i will feel, how it seems like everyone else feels
just the feeling of being in a family
knowing your coming from the same place
and like the same things
i swear between those 20 something sweaty men haha 
there was so much laughter
it was a really great expereince
o yeah
your probably wondering what im talking about

See whats going to happen is im going kidnap him, and the rest of the band
then stuff trent into a box and wrap it all up
put rogaine on his head so his hair will slowly grow back
then he will arrive at britts on chirstmas eve
so when she wakes up on christmas she will go downstairs and see this tiny little box
you see trent is small enough to fit into it
and shes going to open it up and trent will be in there singing about being stuck in a box
then he will pop out with his hair fully grown
and go merry chirstmas! can i have some cookies!!
and then him and britt will rejoice and dance
then the rest of the band will be flown in and there going to land on her roof
then go in her house and the whole band will play a free concert for her!
yay!!!!
haha
merry chirstmas britt!! woo hoo

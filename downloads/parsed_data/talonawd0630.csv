 Autumns Monologue

Oh why cant I be what you need 
a new improved version of me 
but i'm nothing so good 
no i'm nothing 
just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs
of violence of love and of sorrow 
i beg for just one more tomorrow 
where you hold me down fold me in 
deep deep deep in the heart of your sins 

I break in two over you 
I break in two 
And each piece of me dies 
And only you can give the breath of life 
But you dont see me, you dont... 

here i'm in between darkness and light 
bleached and blinded by these nights 
where im tossing and tortured til dawn 
by you, visions of you then youre gone 
the shock lifts the red from my face 
when i hear someone's taking my place 
how could love be so thoughtless, so cruel 
when all, all that i did was for you 

i break in two over you 
i break in two 
and each piece of me dies 
and only you can give the breath of life 
but you dont see me you dont..

THursday
Understanding in a Car Crash



Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat and gets caught 
These broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lost 
In trying so hard to look away from you 
We followed white lines to the sunset 
I crash my car everyday the same way 

Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time runs through our veins 
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again) 
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twlight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done 

I dont want to feel this way forever 
A dead letter marked return to sender 

Broken watch you gave me turns into compass 
It's two hands still point to the same time 12:03, our last goodbye 

So push the seats back a little further 
I can see the headlights coming 
So push the seats back a little further 
Roll the windows down and take a breath 
I can see the headlights coming 
They paint the world in red and broken glass 

Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time runs through our veins 
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again) 
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twlight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done 

I dont want to feel this way forever 
A dead letter marked return to sender 

The spinning hubcaps set the tempo for the music of a broken window 
With the cameras on the cameras click 
We open up the lens and can't stop 

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twlight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done 

I dont want to feel this way forever 

when the lights are on the cameras click
we open up the lens to broken glass
(and it's over in a flash)

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twlight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done

A star up in the sky 
A Poem to the dead
Let this mistake 
Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes 
So drain out my lungs 
Before the fluid brings a choke 
I can not inhale the sparkle of your voice 

A star up in the sky 
A Poem to the dead 
Let this mistake 
Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes 
So drain out my lungs

Let me walk on high wire of rusty nails 
While barefoot shedding the flesh of our existence 

I wanted to break the fall

A star up in the sky 
A poem to the dead
Let this mistake 
Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes 
So drain out my lungs 
Before the fluid brings a choke 
I can not inhale the sparkle of your voice 

Now's the time 
Now's the time 

The more I try 
The more I lose 
But today 
Will you remember me ?

3. Ain't Love Grand-Atreyu

It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your head 
It's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrong 

Gutted like a pig, all you want is the world to bleed, someone somewhere stole your desire 
The pain akin to, being punched in the throat, and stabbed in the chest 

You would rather bleed than be without her 
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears 
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry, your screams play in your empty room 

It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your head 
It's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrong 

Your bed swallows you whole as the days bleed together, torment on the lips 
Of a loved one, and if you try hard enough,
you can almost taste her, feel her pass and 
Scream, OH GOD WHY ME

You would rather bleed than be without her 
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears 
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry, your screams play in your empty room

It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your head 
It's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrong"

each drag's a drop of blood a grain
a minute of my life
it's all I've got just to stay down
why the fuck am I still down
I'm hoarding all that's mine
each time I let just one slip by
I'm wasting what is mine

I really truly love her,cause losing her would be like losing a part of myself. On the job side I have now been working at Wilrae for 8 months I do like it. Although I have been thinking ""Is this what I really want to be doing forever.I came to a conclusion that I don't.I want to go back to school, and get into photography.I need to research it though.Since I haven't updated in awhile I know have found a car to replace my Eagle Talon Tsi.I now own a 2000 Honda Civic Si.I like it way more than my old car.It still needs a tune up,but with the Christmas holiday I have to wait which sucks. I got a iguana 3 months ago which I am happy to say he is alive and healthy. The new house I am living in is alot better than where I use to live.Though the convience of things being close is non-exsitant its still ok.Espically now that my angel sleeps over at my house alot more.We spend almost every weekend together(all night and all day) which is awesome. On a very sad note.It is a sad day.Dimebag Darrell guitarist of ""Pantera"" was killed last night. It is so fucked up how it happened. I thought it was suppose to be safe at shows. Its crazy he was killed right on stage. He was a all time great guirtarist that will be missed.So smoke a dimebag for him.anyways thats about it for now I will update more often now since my sister gave my livejournAL a new look because she is awesome.

America is wonderful

America, America 

When there's dancing I want to lead
even if you're whirling around alone
Let yourselves be controlled a little
I'll show you how it really goes
We're making a nice round dance
Freedom is playing on all violins
Music is coming out of the White House
and Mickey Mouse is standing in front of Paris

We're all living in America
America is wonderful
We're all living in America
America, America

I know moves that are very useful
and I will protect you from missteps
And whoever doesn't want to dance at the end
doesn't know yet that they must
We're making a nice round dance
I will show you the way
Santa Claus is coming to Africa
and Mickey Mouse is standing in front of Paris

We're all living in America
America is wonderful
We're all living in America
America, America

We're all living in America
Coca-Cola, Wonderbra
We're all living in America
America, America

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
I don't sing my mother tongue
No, This is not a love song

We're all living in America
America is wonderful
We're all living in America
America, America

We're all living in America
Coca-Cola, sometimes war
We're all living in America

Song: All My Problems 

smile empty soul 
all my problems

by now
i should have been somwhere
or gone to school, or fixed my hair
back down 
tell it to someone else
who gives a shit and needs your help

cos i found 
what i needed 
and i don't need you to tell me how you feel
and if i fall
you are not the one that has to cope and deal

all my problems are for me

my god 
look at his tattoos and those earrings
he could never get 
a good job
go home and beat your kids 
so they don't turn out as bad as me

cos i found 
what i needed 
and i don't need you to tell me how you feel
and if i fall
you are not the one that has to cope and deal

all my problems are for me
i don't need your eyes to see
i will be what i will be

stop coming around cause you bother me 
stupid mutherfucker pull your head out your ass and see
what don't you get, was i stuttering
i don't need to take your shit get away from me

not even my own family believes in me.They just want me to follow in my dads footsteps I guess and work at UPS forever but fuck that.It just seems like everyone is against me.When they don't even know the real me.I don't even have not to take my frustation out on.I use my skateboard.I love skateboarding it just frees my mind,but I cracked my deck and I have to wait this sucks.But I'm very happy about my new job and aggravated at the same time what the FUCK?"

to throw these darkened thoughts away

for whats inside my mind

i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried
now i wipe away the tears
once i died
now im alive
a-live!
little things take me everyday
lots of pain is how i like to play
better not cross that line
why's this in my head have to be saved
its something i cant throw away
whats inside my mind
i am alive
i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried
now i wipe away the tears
once i died
now im alive

i find my time
im in a twine
im falling in this place i thought i left behind
(feeling so alive)
a-live!
i am alive
i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried

Song: With This Knife 

Lyrics:

i let myself fall into a lie
i let my walls come down
i let myself smile and feel alive
i let my walls come down
no matter how i try i don't know why
you push so far away
you wrapped your hands tight around my heart
and squeezed it full of pain 

with this knife i'll cut out the part of me 
the part that cares for you
with this knife i'll cut out the heart of me
the heart that cares for you

i can't believe the way you took me down
i never saw the pain
coming in a million broken miles
like poison in my veins

[chorus]

the hate and the fear
the nightmares that wake me up
in the tears
the nightmares and (the hate)...
told u its all my fault fuck it I don't give a shit no more just read your nov-14 entry explains it all.Oh well I lost you"

i don't wanna give up before i die

he worked so hard his bones are breaking
he wore them down but long ago he lost the feeling
his good intentions leave me shaking, show me how
i don't ever want to end up like he did
and...

i don't wanna live like my mother
i don't wanna let fear rule my life
and i don't wanna live like my father
i don't wanna give up before i die

when i have kids
i won't put any chains on their wrists, i won't
i'll tell them this
there's nothing in this world that you can't be if you want it enough"

""How Can I Live""

I am so alike you,
In so many ways.
I know I'm just a copy,
That carries on the stain.

But, We make the same mistakes.
Cause, We are one in the same.
But, We leave behind the stain.
I cannot seperate.

All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?

I am your mirror image,
I'm all you left behind.
You made me what I am,
Then who the Hell am I?

But, We make the same mistakes.
Cause, We are one in the same.
But, We leave behind the stain.
I cannot seperate.

All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?

Why, you're nor guess or forget,
I know that our lives are the same,
Maybe we've got,
Just a guessing game,
A dirty stain,
That I cannot play.
But I follow your steps,
In the same way that you just walked away,
And blocked the way through.
I...will...not...live!

Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you.

Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you.

All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?"

"event","Yes I'm glad this week has finally come to a conclusion.But the best part is i only have ten days of school left and I'm out.I can finally take a good week to get some much needed sleep.Then find a job.I haven't wrote in this shit for a whole week because I never have time.Anyways,after i get the school and work day down I get to see my beautiful angel.Shes so sweet sometimes espically leaving me sweet voice messages at 1:30 in the morning.I heard it in school and it really did make my day.I found another thing out that being a shop manger is a head ache.Stupid asses don't listen to u when u say get the car out now.No they say yeah sure and just keep working on the car.Its pretty aggravating.Other than that the new Korn cd comes out in like 2 or 3 weeks it's going to be great.Yesterday my angel and I watched the movie Finding Nemo.Its a pretty cool movie.Not bad.Then after it was over she was playing her game and I fell asleep, but she woke me up by jumpin on her bed and lying on top of me.It was fun.Well I'm gald the weekend is here so I can get some rest."

"event","WOAH! HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYBODY. It was awesome, me, Tia, Rookie, Maddie, Lisa and heaps of their friends all went to the park down beside Rookies house and got pretty wasted, but it was so much fun. And somehow Maddie got her hands on some firecrackers so we let those off, but one of them got stuck into someones fence so we had to do a runner, hehehe. It was awesome fun! School this year is going to be so hard, with so much schoolwork. 
I don't want to go back to school :( :( :(
Sorry I haven't been updating much but I've been busy. Me and Bec have been spending way to much time together, I swear we'll snap soon. She's so gorgeous, I love Bec. She's my best friend, along with Tia and Chloe.
I haven't seen Chloe for ages.... Honey, I MISS YOU :(
I went and bought the LotR box set today, and I'm going to go watch all the bonus material now :) Hooray!
Yummy Viggo is mine!"

"event","Just got back from Tia's because my parents couldn't pick me up any earlier. I am soooooo tired, the marathon was perfect. They had 20 minutes intermission between each movie so we didn't get deep vein thrombosis or something. But it was pure heaven <3333 Then we grabbed a coffee and cruised over to Tia's AND GUESS WHO PICKED US UP! Thats right, Tia's brother. After perving on Viggo and Hugo Weaving and getting picked up by Rhys, everything was perfect. 
Im so tired so I'm gonna go crash and not wake up for 3 days. Hehe <333 you all"

"event","Hai guys! My friend Chloe told me to sign up to LJ because its a great way to meet new people, and I already had a myspace, facethejury and facepic account i figured sure, why not. So here i am. I probably wont be blogging much because school this year is going to be hectic, and yeah. Its Christmas in a few days, I'm so totally excited. After the whole morning-presents thing I'm going out with Tia, Chloe, Bec, Hadie and Sam to go to the LotR movie marathon, and then back to Tia's house so we can perve on her cute brother ^.^ Well, I hope Tia won't be perving -.-
Anyway my grans come up from Dunedin and I'm so not looking forward to having her stay for a week. Hehe I'll be moving in with all my friends to escape! She's so mean, I thought grans were supposed to be nice. I had way to much coffee and icecream this morning when Bec was over and now i constantly need to go to the bathroom. I dont think I shouldve said that, I'm sure everyone doesnt need to know about my bowel problems. 

Oh yeah, isnt this picture totally cute?

"event","I was at my ex-boyfriend's house hanging out the other day when an evil mage spotted me.  I've always hidden my mystical abilities to avoid situations, but for some reason he could see through my incognito.  He attacked as he walked through the door and I swiftly removed and banned him from the house.  I quickly cast a protection spell on Chris (the ex) and went out to confront the mage.  He scowled at me and said he would come back.  He bitterly yelled that my powers were too great for one person as he vanished.  I went back inside and cast a mind erase spell on Chris.  He didn't need to see or know what just happened, and I wasn't sure how to explain.  The protection spell is still in effect, which means no one with mystical powers can hurt him, even me.  I suppose that's good because I was tired of hurting him.  Too bad he'll never know."

"event","Today I learned how to fly.  To my surprise it was quite a disappointment.  Not only did it take as much energy, if not more, as running, it was just as slow and required tons of stamina to remain in the air.  The worst part was that I had no idea how to land.  You fly horizontal, but stand vertical, I found it hard to get from on to the other.  I had to land on my belly in the grass.  I suppose more practice will fix this problem, but I'm not in any hurry to try again."

"event","I was talking to this gorilla at the St. Louis Zoo. And he was telling me all about the world. He used to be in the circus until this huge sexual harassment suit was filed against him. Well while in the circus he would travel a lot. Since that is what circuses do. Once while in Afghanistan he spoke to an elephant poacher who was cousins with a hermaphrodite who frequented clubs in St. Louis. Well this hermaphrodite was in love with a necromancer who was famous for casting spells on visiting aliens from Rigel 17, which was around the Betelgeuse area in inner space. Well once, he made the mistake of casting a spell on a lovely visitor by the name of Yikbaba, AKA Chile Elmer. Yikbaba has been an infamous visitor since the mid 40s and has been linked to several historical events such as the malfunction of the A-bomb in 68', the assassination of JFK, the supposed death of Elvis and Morrison, and most recently and importantly the invention of skyy vodka, plus many other situations. Yikbaba knew the ways of necromancers, for he was consorts with Merlin. Once he realized a spell had been cast upon him he grew in great rage. Being normally a timid alien, Yikbaba blew his lid. Literally. See, in his possession he carried a jar of ippy-yappers. (Ippy-yappers are small parasite like creatures that attach to their host and, well in human cases, make them stupider. if ippy-yappers are shaken up profusely, the container holding them would explode, and they would be set free to roam the lands. this rarely happens.) Yikbaba wasn't sure why he brought these to earth with him, but since he never left home without them, there they were, in a jar in Yikbaba's possession. Yikbaba, having the horrible habit of shaking like a mad man when angered, did as such. Which set the ippy-yappers free some where in South America. Yikbaba knew what a mess he had created, but feared little since he believed it would be nearly impossible to make the human race more dumb, however he was still obligated to report the incident to the Intergalactic Space Regulators (ISR), ippy-yappers and comp-frakiers division. When the ISR received news of the releasing of such a parasite in the galaxy known as the Milky Way, they panicked. The Milky Way galaxy was considered primitive and lacking in the basic intergalactic knowledge of space. Realizing that such a parasite could set back the human race for years and years, and realizing exactly how far back the humans are already, they decided to send Agent Doll Viper and Agent Red Liberty. Both agents were from the Googlepow vicinity, which means they were ghastly and quite frightful. Being the ugliest race (according to the Intergalactic Council), they had the wonderful ability of changing forms. So when assigned to Earth to collect ippy-yappers, they were able to take the shape of very attractive humans. During their mission to Earth they met up with some North Americans named Bubba and Bojo. After briefly speaking to them, they realized Bubba and Bojo were infected with the ippy-yappers, and promptly killed them. They were wrong. Realizing how difficult of a mission this would become they decided to quit their jobs and start a cult in the state of Utah and lead these ignorant people into their way of thinking. It was about then that I landed in Phoenix for a lay over back to St. Louis and purchased a gumball machine."

"event","<P>Literally! Starbucks really IS the shit.</P>
<P>It was a hazy night in which we got together and decided to go check it out; to see what the hype was about.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was unseasonably&nbsp;warm despite being knee deep in winter.&nbsp; The low clouds whized by&nbsp;with a sense of urgency, as if they had somewhere to go.&nbsp;</P>
<P>We went out the other night some friends and I to this wretched hellhole and I was offended by the culture of obscene greed and runaway&nbsp;hype&nbsp;exhibited in there.&nbsp; Oh my God, everything reeks of ""the man"".&nbsp; It's the perfect example of greedy&nbsp;people stealing something that doesn't belong to them and passing it off as their own, and making themselves cool in the exchange.&nbsp; The corporate greedy geezer with a pony tail in his italian suit pretending to be cool and young by&nbsp;wanting to hang out with younger people---&nbsp;that's the first mental image that came to mind upon entering that place and as I wondered what kind of loser would concoct such a horrid idea, such a lame and plastic/matrialistic/shallow sorry excuse of a coffee shop?</P>
<P>Our experience at Starbucks was excrutiatingly unpleasant, and that's putting it mildly.&nbsp; This was the raping of an idea.&nbsp; What I saw and experienced was the raping&nbsp;of a bohemian subculture and bastardizing it, turning it into some greedy scheme for a quick buck.&nbsp; Starbucks doesn't know coffee.&nbsp; Starbucks doesn't <EM>get</EM> coffee.&nbsp; They don't understand anything about coffees and coffee drinking, plus the social athmosphere/ambience that usually permeates around it.&nbsp; It was a travesty to wath, like watching someone getting beheaded and not being able to do a thing about it.&nbsp; For shame!</P>
<P>Ok in detail, here is why Starbucks is the epitome of putrid excrement, the incarnation&nbsp;into a capitalist scheme of all that is wrong in the world.&nbsp; First of all, when you go to a coffee shop or cafe, the first thing you anticipate is the aroma of coffee brewing in the back.&nbsp; You anticipate that&nbsp;your senses will de delightfully caressed&nbsp;by the essences of robust and rich coffee aromas, tantalizing you of things to come.&nbsp; Naturally you expect, nay demand, that more than&nbsp;one coffee variety be served... after all this IS a coffee house.&nbsp; At Rio Java and other decent coffee shops there are many different types of coffees you can taste.&nbsp; Not at starbucks, all they got is the horrid ""house blend"" and it is the most substandard&nbsp;rancid coffee I have ever tasted.&nbsp; There's no taste, no aroma, no tones, no depth&nbsp;to the coffee,&nbsp;insipid as warm water.&nbsp; You would expect them to have at least the basics like Sumatran Mandheling,&nbsp;Pecan Roast, Acapulco Roast, Colombian, Turkish, Mocha, Swiss Alpine, etc.&nbsp; The basics.&nbsp; But no, they've never even heard of Blueberry poppy seed coffee.&nbsp; That's how greedy these people are.&nbsp; They're not interested in providing a good service, and not interested in earning their money the old fashioned way in which a fair exchange of money was the gratuity for a decent service and quality product.&nbsp; Now, the people at Starbucks only wish to provide you with one flavor of coffee, and your only options are Tall, Grande and Venti.&nbsp; What ever happenned to small medium and large?&nbsp; Oh, and they say ""we don't have small, large is small""; which is a liebecause the GRANDE was damn small.&nbsp; So only one variety of coffee.&nbsp; Your only options are size.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is nowehre to sit.&nbsp; The place is sooooo ridiculosuly small that it's not even funny.&nbsp; My room is bigger than their lobby.&nbsp; They only had 2 tables and a smallish desk.&nbsp; Plus there is a very awkward uncomfortable feeling when you do sit there and talk and have your coffee, the staff (which I counted about 12 dudes, oh I'm sorry ""Baristas"" as they make themselves be called) are just staring at you-- for the same&nbsp;reason that there's way too many of them sitting around doing nothing.&nbsp; There's too many coffee jerks (like soda jerk) doing nothing at all... I don't know how they justify their pay.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why it's soo damn expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can fit 6 of their tiny tables in my room alone.&nbsp; Everything is soooo overprized and hyped up.&nbsp; My cup of coffee came&nbsp;out to 6 dollars, that is an outrage.</P>
<P>Oh and that's another thing, they give themselves this weird title ""Barista"", as if it were some sacred ethereal job description, as if their job was meaninful and productive, as if they were indispensable.&nbsp; It's soo pompous and self agrandizement.&nbsp; It's just silly and stupid, to call yourself something pompous like barista.&nbsp; What a&nbsp;joke&nbsp; these people are.&nbsp; Oh, and they expect tips for preparing your coffee... let me repeat that, they expect you to tip them for doing their job, which they get paid for anyway.&nbsp; Heck, if they expect a tip I'd rather tip the burger flipper at Whataburger that prepares my burger&nbsp;because that job requires a little more effort and skill than pouring from a coffee&nbsp;pitcher.</P>
<P>To top it off, there's 3 starbucks now in the works.&nbsp; One that already opened, another one that they're building by Boca Chica and the expressway, and they've also invaded the cafeteria at my school.&nbsp; They bought the cafateria and are turning it into a starbucks.&nbsp; Now where am I gonna get my vegetarian fix?&nbsp; They're invading like locusts.&nbsp; Two starbucks are opening up in the next 1 1/2 months; it's an epidemic.</P>"

I hope I don't get an incompetent teacher that loves to chat but seldom teach like I've had before.&nbsp; And I hope that nobody that likes to yak yak yak sits around me... those people that love to talk during class are sooo annoying, and such a big distraction.&nbsp; Even if all they do is whisper to each other, I can still hear them and it's really annoying.&nbsp; They are an abomination.&nbsp; I hope I don't get any more of those anywhere near where I may sit.&nbsp; If they wanna talk they should go outside.</P>
<P>Anyway, I still don't have the last book I need.&nbsp; I had it ordered and still hasn't arrived, and classe begin this Tuesday.&nbsp;I hate UTB, the administration is sooo incompetent and ill prepared to run a learning institution.&nbsp; Anywho, once I settle in and am not surrounded by&nbsp;dumb people who love to waste our time &nbsp;by talking, then I'll be happy.&nbsp; Hopefully i won't be as queasy.</P>"

"event","<P>Yes vegetarian bodybuilding!!! Sounds weird I know but it's something that apparently is possible.&nbsp; Out of the blue it occurred to me yesterday, that since I love working out and pretty much consider&nbsp;myself&nbsp;a part time bodybuilder, and since now I have embraced&nbsp;a vegetarian diet, it seemed to me that the next logical step was to go all out and embrace a lifestyle of vegetarian bodybuilding.&nbsp; Alas, I thought to myself, this is new and radical- i'm a pioneer, I'll write a book on vegetarian bodybuilding and make millions LOL But lo and behold, when out of curiosity I&nbsp;googled&nbsp;the words vegetarian and bodybuilding, out came not hundreds but a modest 15 or so decent pages dealing on the matter.&nbsp; Apparently this is nothing new, there are quite a few bodybuilding websites and a few forums for open discussion ( I counted a whole two message boards and three blogs) Woo Hoo!&nbsp; So apparently I'm not alone in the world and others have paved the way.&nbsp; I still gotta do all the work LOL but this way I can learn from their efforts and experiences... there's recipes and techniques, tips on where and how to find herbs and veggies and mushrooms, etc.&nbsp; Ok so&nbsp;I won't be known as the father of vegetarian bodybuilding, but I can still bask in the expertise of others who are out there leading the way.</P>
<P>I know this is new and in the minority but the numbers apparently are growing.&nbsp; I did find a heck of a lot of websites and articles, blogs, posts of every kind denuoncing vegetarianism, but other serious more mature articles questioned the practice objectively and without an agenda.&nbsp; They questioned soberly and open mindedly wether vegetarian body sculpting had a chance, the risks and benefits involved, and wether the results would be the same as conventional bodybuilding. At any rate, as a vegetarian I do still stick to milk,&nbsp;but no eggs.&nbsp; I found&nbsp;quite a few bodybuilders who are stricly vegans, no eggs and no dairy.&nbsp; Wow, I'm impressed but I don't envy them. LOL I do like milk maybe a bit too much to give it up, and it's an excellent protein source.</P>
<P>So far it's going great.&nbsp; I sleep less for some reason, but I also am dreaming more.&nbsp; Often&nbsp;irrational and complicated dreams, but the funny thing is that now upon waking I immediately know WHY I dreamt what I dreamt, and what it means, what my subconsious is trying to tell me.&nbsp; Just the mere&nbsp;act of understanding what my subconsious is telling me is enough to resolve some ""issues""&nbsp;or conflicts I previosuly had.&nbsp; I'm letting go of fears I didn't even know I had and finding encouragement to purseu my dreams and career, fidning the resolve to go ahead with my plans when I was previosuly afraid or ambivalent, I understand certain aspects of my life from different perspectives, and many more things.&nbsp; I guess without all the toxins my mind is less clouded and I am finally unleashing my brain's and body's full potential.&nbsp; Other issues do need me to take action, but the mere fact that I am no longer sailing in the blind pitch-dark oceans of before, misguided misdirected, now that I know what needs to be done to resolve certain conflicts like jumpiness for example (I still have Post Tramautic Stress Disorder), and so now I know what I need to do. = )&nbsp;</P>"

"event","<P>I got most of my books yesterday. I went by the bookstore and luckily I found what I needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I still need is my Cell &amp; Molecular Biology book which I didn't get&nbsp;because it hasn't arrived yet, and my Chemistry book with my chemistry lab manuals.&nbsp; For the mere fact that classes begin on the 17th, next Tuesday, you would expect them to get their act to gether at the bookstore and order the books we're gonna need so they arrive on time but Nooooo, incompetent as always, they decided to wait till the last minute and nobody knows what's going on or when the books will arrive. The same thing happenned to me last semester, I had to wait 3 weeks after school started to finally get my Calculus book.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I did get my Genetics book and genetics lab manual, I got my microbiology textbook and microbiology lab manual, I did get my molecular biology workbook and I have other books that I will reuse this semester.&nbsp; So everything's progressing nicely.&nbsp; Oh I saw this shirt at the mall which I soooo badly wanted but they didn't have it in my size.&nbsp; All they had was small and XXL.&nbsp; It was a cool white t-shirt that said ""Meet the fuckers"" and it had a picture od Cheney and Bush on the front. Anywho, I'm gonna love this semester.&nbsp; I am not taking any math classes fo Spring = D Not beause I didn't want to , I still need Calculus 2 and 3, but the teacher Calculus 1 and 2 this semester is a horrible horrible person.&nbsp; She's mean and arrogant and disrespectful, and ot top it off she doesn't know how to teach and just loves to waste time criticizing the students--finding flaws in their penmanship, criticizing their problem solving skills, or getting downright nasty and resorting to personal attacks.&nbsp; I wonder why she hasn't been fired yet.&nbsp; I'm gonna wait till summer sessions 1 and 2 to take Calculus 2 and 3.</P>

"event","Much to the dismay and disapproval of my mom and my brother, I am officially calling myself a vegetarian now.  It's not the nomenclature itself that I chose for myself that my family opposses, it's the commitment to eliminate meat from my diet that seems to have sparked in them an insidious (albeit irrational) need to inform me of their disapproval.  If they disapprove that's fine.  I just wish they would keep their opinions to themselves.  As an aside note, one of the persons whom I considered a friend and which I've known for a long time recently showed his true colors and revealed how racist he truly is and the degree to which he holds contempt and disdain for me due to the color of my skin.  His has always been a world of of ephemeral trendyness and fleeting materialism and shallowness.  I guess it was a moment of carelessnes, an unguarded moment in which he let the facade down and showed his true colors and made an incredily racist and disrespectful comment at me; which he later tried to downplay like it was nothing.  Anyways, I'm grateful he uncovered himself so that now I know what kind of person he is and so I don't waste my time and energy on this person.  And to think that all these years, these past 15 years I actually believed this person was a friend of mine.  Oh well... So I don't know what's worse, to have a friend or family member that disapproves of me and who secretely hates me an keeps their opinions to themselves (not ever letting me find out until 15 years later they're careless and it slips out), or to have a friend or family member who dislikes me and tells me to my face.  I could really do without the comments, and the bad company.

At any rate, I'm happy today.  I have a great vegetarian cookbook which I bought today at Waldenbooks.  It's so pretty and all the food has pictures so you know what you're suppossed to end up with when you follow the recipes.  Everything looks yummy.  I can't tolerate meat or processed stuff.  All those chemicals give me headaches and makes me moody.  I wan to live happy and free of chemical manipulation.  For a while now I've been trying to put together vegetarian meals but it's always a shot in the dark.  I don't know what I'm doing, how to balance a meal p[roperly, how to mix which ingredients with what, what spices to use and basically what to prepare.  I've always been made to feel ashamed or apologetic for choosing a vegetarian diet, and the snippy comments don't end there.  An active campaign of disinformation waged at me from all angles trying to dissuade me and to proselytize me to revert to a carnivorous means of sustenance, mocking the vegetarian diet and lifestyle, telling me that it's a very narrow repertoire and that there is no such thing as a vegetarian diet, that you can't put together a leaflet of veggi recipes, much less a whole book.  Well not only were they proven wrong today when I showed them my vegetrain cookbook, there are others, many other books out there which I plan on buying later.

I've been leafing through the book and I'm noticing that preparing vegetarian meals is much much easier and faster to prepare than meat-centered ones, mostly because veggies don't need to be tortured with heat to beat them into submission, veggies don't need to be cooked soooooo long. And all the ingredients needed are way cheaper.  So today was a very productive day."

"event","<P>I found this little tidbit of how things used to be like in the 1500s and how they have shaped our culture. sayings, and thus way of thinking societally and such.</P>
<P><STRONG>Most people got married in June because they took their yearly bath in May, and still smelled pretty good by June. However, they were starting to smell, so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor. Hence the custom today of carrying a bouquet when getting married. <BR><BR>Baths consisted of a big tub filled with hot water. The man of the house had the privilege of the nice clean water, then all the other sons and men, then the women and finally the children Last of all the babies. By then the water was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it. Hence the saying, ""Don't throw the baby out with the bath water."" <BR><BR>Houses had thatched roofs-thick straw-piled high, with no wood underneath. It was the only place for animals to get warm, so all the cats and other small animals (mice, bugs) lived in the roof. When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would slip and off the roof. Hence the saying ""It's raining cats and dogs."" <BR><BR>There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house. This posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings could mess up your nice clean bed. Hence, a bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top afforded some protection. That's how canopy beds came into existence. <BR><BR>The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than dirt. Hence the saying ""dirt poor."" The wealthy had slate floors that would get slippery in the winter when wet, so they spread thresh (straw) on floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they added more thresh until when you opened the door it would all start slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the entranceway. Hence the saying a ""thresh hold."" <BR><BR>(Getting quite an education, aren't you?) <BR>In those old days, they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added things to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day. Sometimes stew had food in it that had been there for quite a while. Hence the rhyme, ""Peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas porridge in the pot nine days old."" <BR><BR>Sometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite special. When visitors came over, they would hang up their bacon to show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man could ""bring home the bacon."" They would cut off a little to share with guests and would all sit around and ""chew the fat."" <BR><BR>Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with high acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food, causing lead poisoning death. This happened most often with tomatoes, so for the next 400 years or so, tomatoes were considered poisonous. <BR><BR>Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt bottom of the loaf, the family got the middle, and guests got the top, or ""upper crust."" <BR><BR>Lead cups were used to drink ale or whiskey. The combination would sometimes knock the imbibers out for a couple of days. Someone walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them for burial. They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days and the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and see if they would wake up. Hence the custom of holding a ""wake."" <BR><BR>England is old and small and the local folks started running out of places to bury people. So they would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a ""bone-house"" and reuse the grave. When reopening these coffins, 1 out of 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized they had been burying people alive. So they would tie a string on the wrist of the corpse, lead it through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night (the ""graveyard shift"") to listen for the bell; thus, someone could be ""saved by the bell"" or was considered a ""dead ringer."" <BR><BR>And that's the truth... Now, whoever said that History was boring ! ! !</STRONG></P>"

<P><FONT size=5>It's fascinating...</FONT> what the power of belief can do.&nbsp; And it's worrysome how easily a delusion can poison a mind.&nbsp; Believing something that's untrue, the shaping of perception, the deceing of our senses and beliefs, it's all a little game to some.&nbsp; I began to reminisce of the days way back when, about 5 years ago, when I first discovered the wingmakers, and the candy coated reality they offer.&nbsp; It wasn't until today that I realized&nbsp;that the wingmaker ploy is also a doom and gloom scenario like the New World Order and any other apocalyptic plan that some alien&nbsp;civilization&nbsp;wants to implement on this planet.&nbsp; We got the Draconian Illuminati one the one hand trying to implement their New World Order, One world government, one world religion scenario for total&nbsp;population control.&nbsp; One the other hand we got the Zeta Reticulans (the greys) wanting to infiltrate our world and pass themselves off as human by their&nbsp;hybridization program.&nbsp; They're trying to not take over but to cohabitate this planet with us without asking for permission first.&nbsp; Their planet is too fucked up because of the time_rift experiments they did there&nbsp;and everyone that remained has&nbsp;some sort of alien cancer.&nbsp; Then we have the traitor semi_humans who&nbsp;allied themselves with the&nbsp;Orion aliens, the Nordics, who&nbsp;also want to subjugate humanity, but just for the fun of it.&nbsp; Then we got the Animus race of ETs who are suppossedly on their way here in a large mothership.&nbsp; And now I find out about these wingmakers who pased themselves off as humans from the 28th century, who in reality are ntohing more than just another race of aliens who wants to fight the Draconians but on our planet as the battlefield.&nbsp; It seems our only true allies are the Angel/Archangel Orders and the Pleiadeans/Pleyarans, as well as the Vegans, Lyrans, the Galactic&nbsp;Federation, the Elohim, The Andromedans, th Alpha Centauri Race, the Epsilon Eridani, etc.</P>
<P>Ok so why are the wingmakers evil?&nbsp; Oh let's just say that the angels themselves are communicating to humans at this point in time to warn us that they're evil.&nbsp; That they're just using humanity to fight the Draconians/Reptilians.&nbsp; Many channelers and psychics are reporting the same findings as they channel the messages from different angels and spirit guides.&nbsp; Three good books I recoomend to read more on this are ""Voyares I:&nbsp; The Sleeping Abductees"" and ""Voyagers II: The Secrets of Amenti"" both by Ashayana Deane and&nbsp;""The Pleiadean Workbook"" by Barbara Hand Clow.&nbsp; The Wingmakers justwwant to use humanity for sinister purposes, to use humans to fight the Draconian/Reptilian Illuminati for them.&nbsp; They want to create disturbances in the Space-Time conitnuum that will allow them to take over a large portion of the galaxy cluster.&nbsp; Good ting we're allied now with the winning side, the Pleiadeans and the Elohim.</P>"

<P><FONT size=4>I'm very depressed, my doggy died : ( We had to put her to sleep so she wouldn't suffer anymore. She was sooo sick and the doctor said she had no cure and she was only gonna get worse. And what's sad is that I didn't really get a chane to treat her nicely like take her to the beach or to laguna atascosa or soemthing like that. wE only had her for 22 days = (</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Poor doggy, we had her vaccinated immediately when we adopted her from the animal shelter but it turns out that despite the fact that she had no symptoms she was already sick. When we got her she was already in her final stages of her disease. She had distemper and a neurological wasting disease like parkinsons. It was a white and brown Beagle and Dalmatian mix, she was sooo cute and such a well behaved dog.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>When we got her she was sooo skinny and sad, but with time we made her feel comfortable and special, and loved. I think our doggy had been mistrated a lot because she was very scared of people and very very skinny and always sad. But we saw her change and become happy and she even began to wag her tail and play with the other dog. She would lift her paw and call you, really cute. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>My only solace is that she won't suffer anymore, that she won't feel pain and have those terrible epileptic seizures and she won't feel the debilitating pain all over her body. That she won't feel the terrible pain in her internal organs that she was having but wouldn't let us know because she was too happy for once to be a dog and be free and be loved. And my consolation is that in her brief time she was with us she was happy, she was allowed to be a dog, and she learned that she was special, that she belonged, and that she mattered.&nbsp; I can only imagine what terrible treatement she received before we adopted her</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>She got to run around and play and chase and have fun with the other dog, and I played with her and she was ecstatic.&nbsp; She got to be a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in her solitary moments she would be in pain and in agony, she would hurt and howl sobbingly and have her seizures, which i didn't discover until Saturday. She had been keeping them from us because she didn't wanna worry us, she didn't wanna burden us with her disease (which wasn't her fault). She didn't have to carry her cross by herself.&nbsp; So we took her to the vet today and he told us she was in her las tstages of distemper and some neurological debilitating disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why she couldn't eat standing, she had to lay dog to eat because her legs were so weak she couldn't hold herself up.&nbsp; The seizures were only gonna happen at smaller and smaller intervals and there was no need to prolong her suffering.&nbsp; She did good, and now it was time for her to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe she came to teach us a spiritual lesson, a cosmic law of love and compassion. It's a testament of how noble and majestic a dog can be.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>You go run play and chase, and sleep till your heart's content precious doggy. You won't suffer anymore in the heavens where you belong. Good dog! Good dog!&nbsp; </FONT></P></FONT>"

You are extremely charismatic and powerful, both in body and in mind, and you always manage to wind up on top of the world.

"event","<P>It's hard to find people that haven't been infected by the media and popular culture.&nbsp; I'm still trying to pick a name for my dog (the new one) and as I have been talking to different friends and relatives of those friends the only names they seem to conjure from their overly exhausted neurons are the same unoriginal and limited names that are gushed at people from every angle; be it tv or radio or even newspapers.&nbsp; Names like Katrina and Rita and Monica (as in Lewinsky)&nbsp;and a handful of other lame names, and all of them volunteered by the way.&nbsp; I haven't asked them for a name, I just commented that I had a new dog&nbsp;and they immediately (almost as if they had rehearsed it) they immediately&nbsp;volunteer a name and tell me you should call her this or you should call her that etc.&nbsp; There's only one person I've asked what I should name my dog because that person's opinions do matter to me = ) But my mom doesn't like the name ""Lola"" so we can't name her that.&nbsp; So we're stil llooking.</P>
<P>I was at HEB the other day standing in line minding my own business trying to buy some pretzels and a roasted chicken while Lo and Behold, the person immediately behind me wants to engage in conversation and of all the topics inthe world, they want to regurgitate at me all the idiotic and trivial and useless tidbits of information being exagerated on tv.&nbsp; He wanted to regurgitate the news at me, as if, if I hadn't&nbsp;had a chance to catch the latest mind poison&nbsp;on one of the major news networks, he wanted to make sure I didn't go a day without not being made aware receiving the same poison and bad news.&nbsp; He wanted to spread the contamination.&nbsp; What would compell one human to go out of his way or to make it his business to make sure that another stranger he will never ever again meet gets his inner peace shattered by the bad news and then my serenity is perturbed.&nbsp; It's like he's miserable and wants others to also be miserable.&nbsp; I don't even watch the news anymore, i avoid the newspapers and the radio because I don't wanna contaminate my mind with the poisons preached at people every day.&nbsp; Yet I can't&nbsp;seem to live a single day in peaceful serenity and tranquility because there's always someone&nbsp;out there&nbsp;making sure I am mae aware of the latest trivial and unimportant news or whatever.&nbsp; Michael Jackson, and the lady that's been missin in Aruba for who knows how long and Lacy peterson and Iraq and all this BS.... I say to myself&nbsp; ""WHO CARES!""&nbsp;&nbsp;: P LOL</P>
<P>But apparently a lot of people have been hypnotized into allowing this junk into their minds and into their lives and have been convinced that they need to concern themselves with the problems of other people.&nbsp; I guess these people have nothing better to do with their lives and have nothing important or meaningful or worthwhile to fill their lives so they have to artificially fill their lives with these intangible and impersonal realities.&nbsp; The news are not entertainment, why do we need 5 or 6 differen networks reporting the exact same doctored-up facts and reporting the same unimportant events? All it is, is nothing but lies.&nbsp; None of what you see on the news is believeable or is in some way altered or doctored-up to conceal an even greater and more sinister truth. Hey it's 1:11 Anyway,&nbsp;Bush even, just recently it was discovered that all of his Question an answer&nbsp;sessions and evetything he does is all planned, all the questions rehearsed ahead of time.&nbsp; Alex Jones talked about everything hat Bush does is an act, a charade or a photo op to&nbsp;create a certain fantasy, an illusion--but at the time I didn't understand what he was saying.&nbsp; But now it all make sense.&nbsp; Bush is following the proven Nazi plan for control.&nbsp; It's a good plan, in&nbsp; the sense that it works, being how Sigmund Freud and Joseph Mengele and Wilhelm Reich among other German imminences of the psyhological fields worked on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;From this plan later stemmed the Monarch_Zombie_Slave Mind Control torture program by which all illuminati members are indoctrinated, which&nbsp;proves why or sheds light on why&nbsp;absolutely all illuminati members are to some degree in a permanent state of hypnosis-- even Bush himself...&nbsp;but that's another story altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Bush does, the carefully planned photo ops and the orchestrated and rigged question and answer interviews and whatever, all of this Hitler used to do as well&nbsp;in order to eliminate subversiveness and unauthorized questions, as did Pol Pot and the Romanoffs and the Chaucheskus.&nbsp; So in the end I think the news are tools of the illuminati to control the minds of people, to create an illusion so they're not made aware of the more sinister truth behind.&nbsp; And I myself will have none of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me, I think no news is good news = D</P>"

"event","<P>I have begun building the fence for my dogs.&nbsp; For now they're still tied becuase they just love to run away, but pretty soon they'll be able to run around free.&nbsp; Apparently, it appears now that the new dog (the white one) is afraid of the dark.&nbsp; She was whimpering and barking in the backyard and we had to leave the lights on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor little thing :( but the black dog is keeping her company.&nbsp; She got her stitches taken out today, so maybe that was causing her to whimper.&nbsp;&nbsp;We finally got to wash her and she's all clean and comfy--She slept all day.&nbsp; Anyways, I found out my dogs love C-Drone Defect.&nbsp; I was playing some of their music and my dogs got all happy and energetic and started frolicking and jumping and biting.&nbsp; Maybe I'm reading their body language wrong and they could be aggravated by it, but they seemed to enjoy themselves.&nbsp; So who knows what's really going on.&nbsp; I think I understand my dogs and then it's possible it could be something else.</P>
<P>And another thing, I keep seeing the synchronicities everywhere, and now more than ever.&nbsp; They come in waves.&nbsp; I have been seeing the number 11:11 everywhere again.&nbsp; Incessantly.&nbsp; Many many times in one day, and the other numbers as well.&nbsp; It's like a flood of energy aimed at me, and there is a very urgent feel to it, like its a very pressing matter.&nbsp; I wish I knew more about these numbers.&nbsp; My dogs seem pretty weird every time they hear my DNA activation CDs.&nbsp; Whenever I play them and my dogs happen to hear it they act intrigued and puzzled and act very bizarre towards it.&nbsp; It's funny how if it weren't for these numbers I wouldn't have my dogs.&nbsp; The only reason why I got Gitana our Belgian Sheepdog is because of her birthday 10-01-04.&nbsp; 10-01 or 10:01 is one of the many repeating synchronicites that seem to haunt me.&nbsp;I mean I see this number everywhere.&nbsp; So when I was ""just&nbsp;looking"" at the dogs at the flea market without any intent of buying any, when I saw this dog looking at me in the eyes so attentively and he seemed wise beyond his years I asked baout this dog, the guy shopwed me his papers and there it was, on his birth certiricate that he had been born on October 1st&nbsp; <STRONG>10-01</STRONG> at at<STRONG> 10:01</STRONG> am and I had to have him.&nbsp; They sold it to me as a male dog, only later did I find out that it was a female.&nbsp; The other dog, the new one&nbsp;is tied to the numbers<STRONG> 3:33</STRONG> and &nbsp;<STRONG>4:44</STRONG> in a very strange way.</P>
<P>All these coincidences seemed, well, planned!!! even though they are mere coincidences.&nbsp; And speaking of planned coincidences, I ran into this article online that made me go ""HEY!!!!!!!! &gt;: ( that was my idea"" at first, but then I realied that it is quite possible that someone came up with it first and I just merely channeled it.&nbsp; Anyway, it's a theory I came up with a long time ago when I was studying the occult, as well as new age&nbsp;topics including the kabballah and tantra.&nbsp; It's just a theory and it's based purely on proven occult knowledge&nbsp;and logic.&nbsp; It's just experimental, but the experiment if done properly should work.&nbsp; It should yield results and produce a magickal child.&nbsp; Thus becomming a planned coincidence in which the magickal child born is to be born under the right astrological signs and favored by sacred numerology.&nbsp; Now I realize that I have stumbled upon a vein that has probably been used for Aeons by those who keep the power to themselves in order to create blessed or gifted humans so that they would go on and become rulers and leaders like King Tuthankamen,&nbsp;High Priests of&nbsp;ancient civilizations like the High Priests of Lemuria and Atlantis, and maybe even the infamous illuminati.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call it ""<STRONG>The Ceremony of the Magickal Child</STRONG>"" because I couldn't think of a more pompous and grandiose name at the time LOL but basically it is a ritual involving Tantric sex and elements of the Kabballah and Golden Dawn magik as well as Rosicrucian and Enochian and a lot a lot of multidimensional and light magik-science.</P>
<P>I call it magick_science because to me it is a science, and not a mere art_form or style or whatever but I see it as a real and tangible science like chemistry or biology.&nbsp; It's an actual science that follows rules of nature and whose experiments if done repeatedly should reveal identical repeatble results.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;contemporary science is sooo backwards today and not considering this new multidimentional spiritual science a real science, they deem it folk tales and superstitions.&nbsp; All of today's sophisticated science was once considered magik.&nbsp; Even philosophy (the pre_physics ) at one time&nbsp;was nothing but vile witchery and blasphemy.&nbsp; Chemistry was&nbsp;the work of the devil, and to speak of a heliocentric solar system was heresy.&nbsp; One day, one day humanity will truly be enlightened and open minded.&nbsp; 11:11</P>
<P>So why did I become interested in this concept of incorporating the influences of the universe on all mulidimensional levels into our lives, (and by that I mean the astrological influences that rule our lies as well as elements of sacred geometry and harmonious mathematics, sacred music&nbsp;and sacred acoustics, etc. including elements of the kabballah and the golden dawn such as the violet flame and the blue flames and the 7 cosmic rays, etc and all manner of occult and new age teachings among which are dna activation and development of psionic and psychic skills)&nbsp;and thusly, incorporating them into our offspring, into our future generations?&nbsp; Because I think I may have&nbsp;accidentally been born under a harmonious sign that is soooo weird that I doubt it is a coincidence.&nbsp; After all, my mom for a long time was a practicing Rosicrucean member. I only imagine what she could know, she never talks about it though-- I hear they are forbidden from talking about special secrets they are told.&nbsp; I was born under the influence of the number 777, and all my life I have been haunted by the supernatural and special coincidences of all kinds.</P>
<P>One of my brothers was born under the influence of the number 23 and 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much I don't understand, yet somehow I think I might be able to find something important about the number 777 if I ever somehow manage to understand/interpret Alesiter Crowley's book ""777 and Other Kabbalistical Writings"".&nbsp; I have it but I just don't understand it.&nbsp; I know a lot of it is symbolic.&nbsp; If I only had a codex by which to compare&nbsp;my theories about it.&nbsp; Andgetting back to the number 23, I finally understand&nbsp;enough about it to get a glimpse of the big picture on earth.&nbsp; 11:44.&nbsp; And I understand the whys and wherefores of the hidden masonic language in their rites, especially as they relate to the lines ""23 skidoo 23 skidoo"" and it's scary to learn of the plans of those in power for when you analyze it all and piece the puzzle together, it all points to the illuminati. </P>

"event","<P>Well I got to wear my <A href=""http://www.impeachbush.org "">ImpeachBush.org</A> sweatshirt last night.&nbsp; I was feeling very cold (and that is usually a symptom of not sleeping well) running on 2 hours of sleep and a pot and a half of coffee trying to finish my ridiculously absurd mountain of math homework, I got so cold and all of my winter clothing is packed and put away in the other room. I didn't feel like rummaging and opening boxes and what not, and my impeachbush sweatshirt was nearby by and I grabbed it and wore it.&nbsp; It's so soft, but I hate cotton.&nbsp; It's a horrible fabric.&nbsp; It ruins easily and only has a shelf life of about 12 months.&nbsp; Planned obsolescense, an interesting concept to keep people poor and enslaved to consumerism.&nbsp; But that's another topic altogether.&nbsp; I wish it was made of something else&nbsp;like wool or rayon.</P>
<P>Anywho, I then went to wal mart to pick up some pencils because I ran out, and on the way I picked up a whataburger.&nbsp; I got some mean stares, but also some approving nods.&nbsp; This got me thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess there's still retarded morons out there who are still hypnotized by the lies that Bush force feeds them throug hthe news channels he controls and they're all in denial living in their Bush created fantasy.&nbsp; When these idiots learn to think for themselves they will see the error of their ways and finally become outraged like the rest of us normal people.&nbsp; I am outraged that some people can still be so stupid, after the blatant 911 attacks which were obviously an inside job, probably to boos the president's approval rating, not surprisingly down since after having been innaugurated&nbsp;the first thing he did was go to on 9&nbsp;month vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the point is, that it's disturbing to watch so many horrible things that the Bush administration is doing to the point of losing sleep.&nbsp; And even more disturbing is to see the zombies that accept at face value all the lies that are fed to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;When will people wake up and realize what is truly going on?</P>
<P>Anyway, I should get some sleep.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really like these periods of unconsciousness.&nbsp; It's the only time I have peace.&nbsp; It's the only time I am not bombared or made aware of the idiotic mistakes the evil Bush administration is perpetrating, it's the only time I am free from being made aware of the&nbsp;treason&nbsp;commited by this evil oil faction as they give tax breaks to the traitor corporations while robbing Americans of their wealth.&nbsp; For shame!&nbsp; </P>

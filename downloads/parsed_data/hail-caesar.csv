"event","I have learned recently in psychology that sometimes because we have been hurt we put up defenses because we don't want to feel a specific pain ever again. Now to me that makes sense, however sometimes those defenses cost to much. You can build a fortress and keep yourself barricaded from the pain you fear is going to attack, but by defending yourself at all costs like that you keep everyone else out. Maybe your defenses work to good, and you scare anyone that cares away.

I think I have to come to grips with the fact that my cold war is over and has been over for a while now. I think I need to ""tear down that wall"" and start letting people back into my life. Defense... hmm... what about that? Well, I dunno. I mean I'm not going to bow down and let someone walk all over me. I guess I just have to decide when is the proper time to defend myself and how much I can take of someone running my name through the dirt.

Whatever... it doesn't matter, I shouldn't concern myself with people who are not willing to say to my face what they think and I shouldn't reply until they have the balls to formally say what's eating at their heart. 

In the end all will work out."

"event","Its 6:30 and I'm bored out of my ass. I don't do much... my life consists of going to school working out and sometimes I get lucky and I get to hear about someone's day and their problems. That's probably the more interesting part of my day... I don't have many friends anymore... So I have to ask myself why is this. 

Lets see... I grew up in a decent size city in New Jersey. I was pretty much middle class all of my life. But anyways... when I was younger I had many friends... and that stayed the same until about 7th-9th grade. That was the time period I began to find myself. I met a good friend during this time... but he was extremely different from me. 

I guess you could have always described me as the kid that never really caused any trouble, never flicked his finger at authority, and always well mannered. However my new friend was different, he grew up in the ghetto so he spoke different and he dressed different, and acted different from me. For me this was never a big deal... but one thing I found out quickly about my new friend was that he was really popular. 

I never really cared about being popular.. till one day out of the blue I just wanted to be. So in that time period between 7th-9th that's all I worried about. I started listening to rap which I never did before, I changed the way I dressed and the way I spoke. And During the start of 9th grade I was actually cool... for a little bit. People liked me because I was cool... but after a few weeks I began to realize that I was cool because I was in the shadow of my friend... so wherever I went, I was known as ******'s boy... and with out him I was just another wannabe.

I came to the conclusion that if someone didn't like me for who I truly was then they could go fuck themselves. So I stopped wearing that ridiculous clothes I began to speak the way English was suppose to be spoken...(I still can't type or spell it though)... and I began to distance myself from my friend. Another factor that drove me away from my friend and his crowd is the fact that I wanted to become a military officer someday, and being that officers are gentlemen I need to be a gentleman as well.

I found out quickly that the *crowd* of friends I thought I had.... I really never had as friends they never gave a shit about me. Except of course my first friend who brought me into the group in the first place. He didn't care what I acted like as long as I was myself. However I still tried to stay away from the group and I would just talk to him every once in a while.

That same year I met a new friend who shared similar goals as I did, and I started hanging out with him more. He also shared my opinions on acting proper in public and a bunch of other things. For the rest of high school I stayed away from all of the groups ... even the anti-popular groups... to me they seemed just as stupid as the people they hated. It was pretty much just me and my one friend. I had other friends too... Mostly from the Internet since I kept to myself and I also had acquaintances but thats all they were.

My one friend who I think was truly an angel sent from heaven... Well I never met her. I met her on the Internet back in 8th grade... But I got extremely close with her between 9th and 10th grade. This girl was different from me... but she was raised like me... but one day her path went in a different direction or something ... so the person she came out as was different from what I came out as. Well this girl had seen a lot of shit and had experienced a lot... some things good... some things bad... but her core was always good and so she became like my big sister.

The places in my heart and soul where I had yet to grow up in... she helped me grow there. Out of all the people in my life so far, she has been the one who has influenced me the most so far. This girl was my friend at every moment I needed a friend... maybe she couldn't hug me or hold me like some friends do during troubled times but she always.... Always... led me in the direction I needed to go in... so that I could solve my own problems. I think the people who never have a friend like that have definitely missed something great in life.

Ok so where did all this go wrong... ok lets see... When I was in my first serious relationship... Damn for a 15 year old... I was truly in love... hell even now... damn that was a great relationship... with a few exceptions in certain parts... one incident in the beginning and a shit load at the end... but lets forget about the ones in the end and look at that first incident.

Everything for me was going perfect. I had an awesome best friend, and I had an awesome girlfriend... until the two collided. I really don't want to get into any details about this... Lets just say I had to make a choice between the two... and I picked my girlfriend. I knew the choice I made was wrong then and I know its still wrong today. This was the first time I was in love and I thought it would last forever... but in the back of my mind... I knew that no matter what my, best friend would never leave my side... Well to make that decision even worst... 2 days before my best friend had told me the darkest things that haunted her life... and unfortunately probably still haunt her to this day.... and I mean the shit she told me was beyond fucked up... and I swear.. If those things happened to anyone else they wouldn't be here anymore... see and I'm not sure but I think I'm the only person she told that stuff too... I dunno but she really needed a friend that... but I still gave my best friend up. My relationship went on and it was great and my girlfriend even tried to undo some of the damage I had done between me and my friend but it was to late.

Life went on and eventually my girlfriend and I broke up... I was destroyed... and guess who I went crawling back too... Yup my former best friend... and she forgave me... and I had been asking myself why would she forgive me after I abandoned her when she truly needed a friend. Well because she is a kind person at heart... and I don't think anyone could change that..... So she helped me out... well about a week after me and my girlfriend broke up... Sept. 11th happened... and as tragic as that was... it actually helped me. It put me in my place, and it reminded me that some things were bigger then me, and extremely more important to me. While I was with my girlfriend she kind of persuaded me to stay out of the military... well after 9/11 that was my main goal... everything I did was to prepare myself to go into the military.

My best friend went through some problems at college and she had to stop being my friend... Her reason was that she didn't want to be close with anyone who had betrayed her before... and as much as I hated losing her and as much as I cried... I knew that I deserved what I got... I did learn though. I swore that what I did to her... I would never do to a friend again. From that moment on... anyone who I considered a close friend was going to be protected by any means at my disposal... Wrong or right I would always stand next to them...

So life went on... The US invaded Afghanistan and me and my boy from school wished we were there serving our country. Then Iraq happened and we both wished we were there too... We graduated high school and we went our separate ways... He went to a Military College and I went to a Maritime College which isn't all that different from a military school just that it concentrates more on the Navy and Marine Corps then the Army... But my dumb ass left... Another dumb ass mistake I made in my life. I guess I was home sick... that and I wasn't in shape.... I won't make that mistake again

Well I came home and I started talking to my ex girlfriend... and we became good friends... and I started talking to another old time friend... and we became good friends too. So I have two really cool friends... I'm learning from the mistakes I made in the past and I'm going back to the Maritime College... I'll either go into the navy or coast guard. 

Well after writing all this... I think its ok that I only have two friends... I don't think I need anymore friends. My ex girlfriend who is now a close friend would probably do anything for me... and so would my other friend... shit... that's all I need. Why have a billion friends who won't do shit for you when I can have two friends who will do anything for me? But to answer that question I asked way the hell up there... Well I guess since I avoided all of those groups I weeded out all of the people who would have been shitty friends and found two who are the green berets of friends. And I have learned so much in these past few years... So I guess everything has turned out for the best and everything will turn out for the best."

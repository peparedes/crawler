Naturally there's no rest for the wicked; I've got to prepare for a full day of dueling tomorrow. At least after that I'll be almost done, and there'll be more time to explore the countryside.

And then watching him dangling like a fish on a hook! <I>All</I> of him, unfortunately. Maybe that wasn't the best idea there, James, I could have lived without seeing that.

So.. dear old cousin Bellatrix is running around turning girls into cockroaches. It was Vance, so I really don't mind that much. Merlin that girl's turning batty. It'll be much more relaxing around here once she's gone off to kill more puppies or whatever she likes doing outside of school.

Then there's Snape, using Killing Curses. I wouldn't have believed it if it was anyone else but Remus telling me, and that includes James. Killing Curses are much too hard to pull off. But Snape..he's twisted enough I think. If it were illegal to just use them in general, and not just on humans and wizards.. Damn. He just did it to scare Remus, like he's some big man or something.

I'll fix him.

James, boy I hope what I told him helps. I know he's a joker, but he's got to tone it down if he's got even the slightest chance of impressing Evans, or at least not leaving a bad taste in her mouth. If it were me going I would've taken McKinnon, no doubt. Look what she got me.. I still can't get over it. This is really.. cool. When did she stop being such a geek?

This is just a friendly reminder to you and Catchlove and whoever else may still by chummy with Crouch Jr. The guy used an Unforgivable on me. An Unforgivable carries an automatic life sentence in Azkaban. It's Dark Magic and if he can do it once, he'll do it again.

But please, feel free to keep rubbing elbows with him.

Catchlove is always an idiot, so I don't care what she does, but you Marlene. You're smarter than her by half. You hating Bellatrix while still liking Crouch is just, it's hypocritical. I don't care if he's your housemate or not. 

There are ways to get a point across without using the Dark Arts. I know it, James knows it, Remus and Peter know it. Evans knows it. You know it. Snape doesn't. Neither does Bellatrix, and neither does Crouch.

Frankie against Remus? WEAK! Why do they keep doing this to us? We're not going to see an all Gryffindor final (don't worry about it, Pete), I get that, but it's unfortunate that all our best Lions are dueling each other so soon. But there's got to be a winner, and I've got to give it to my mate Remus. Sorry Frankie, I know you've been having an exceptional week. At least you'll get to concentrate on OWLs. Hufflepuffs, I hear, make great study partners.

James against Squirrel? The only thing I don't like about this match is that afterwords I'll have to look forward to James matching his wand against Remus. That just sucks. That's right, I'm not even going to worry about this one. If I were you, Queerinus, I'd forfeit. James isn't as gentle as Remus. The lad has a temper, and I'll make sure he stays fired up for this one.

Crouch against Marlene? I don't know, I don't think people should start counting McKinnon out all of a sudden just because she's up against Jr. Psychopath. <s>Damn it.</s> Anything's possible. She can win this.

Harper against Lockhart? I'm sorry, I still can't believe Lockhart even got past the first round. Anyway, Harper, you should thank your lucky stars that you're having such an easy Quarter final. Hey, by some freak chance you could end up dueling Frankie? How cool would that be?

Yeah, it's a bloody shame I wasn't able to go forward, but to the victor goes the spoils. James, if you're up for a little sparring later, I'm all for it.

We're gonna celebrate Marauders-style, aren't we? Yeah we are."

"event","Things are clicking about on an even pace. Rumours are flying around about Crouch by that silly bint, and I don't think it's a stretch to wonder if James put her up to it. I'm glad Crouch isn't comfortable by any means, but all these rumours are a pain for me too. I'm tired of people coming up to me and asking, ""did it hurt?""

It was a fucking Cruciatus, of course it hurt!

<i>Idiots</i>.

Then again, I wasn't too wise in picking a fight with him in the first place. I don't know, I've been having a lot of dark thoughts lately, even before the duel, and ever since. The duel just made them worse.

That bloody pamphlet... the words are getting clearer by the day. I don't want to see the damn words! Should I talk to Bellatrix abo- no, no that's insane.

I need something to take my mind off of this, and looking at Crouch and Snivellus' face makes me want to break something.

I'm going mad. Something better happen, and soon."

That's right, <b>the weekend</b>. I don't want to oversell this thing, since it's bound to be a trouncing rather than a real duel.

However, for anyone who wants to see Barty Crouch Jr. receive an education he can't get at Hogwarts come to the <font size=""5""><b>dead-end of Knockturn Alley at 3:00pm</b></font>.

Cheers and jeers are welcome. Interference is not. If any of you do interfere, I'll have to educate you some too. 

So come one, come all. Think of it as a surefire way to end your boredorm for at least a fortnight."

Now, I forgot to mention that I received my grades on time. The reason is that it's basically the same old, same old. I mean, how many 'E's can a lad look at before becoming bored of them. It's all too easy, really. And an 'O' in Transfiguration? Nice. I'll try to keep that up.

At least my grades give my parents nothing to complain about. Doesn't stop them from trying though. I'm probably expected to be more like Trixie and pull of a sheet of 'O's. Whatever. Who knows what she does to get those marks.

Oh, and for anyone who likes to imagine while they read, I'm shirtless. My body is resting on the roof of a nicely tiled house, glistening with sweat and looking quite spectacular if I do say so myself. And I do.

But I think I might need a hair-cut.

I got an Owl from my dear cousin Andromeda, who's doing fabulously well with that chap Tonks. They sent me a little picture of their little girl, and while I'm not one to get mushy over stuff like the birds might, this chick is <b>cute</b>. I'll post a little picture when I get off my lazy arse, but you've got to see her to believe her. Then again, it's to be expected, right? And with a name like <i>Nymphadora</i>, she'd better be cute.

<i>Nymphadora</i>. I don't care what anyone says, I <i>know</i> that was Andromeda's thinking. What the hell is that? That poor, poor girl.

Remus, hope you're feeling better, mate.

Peter, it's good to see your face on these journals once in a blue m- once in a while.

James and Lily, it'd old news, but the sight of the both of you on the same page fills my heart with bounds of joy.

Spinks, I'm waiting.

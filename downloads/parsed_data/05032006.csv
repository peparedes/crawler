"event","Last night I got taken out by 2 strangers I have just met, and realized that it has been so long since I have hung out with real genuine people. We sat at the piazza and drank beer and talked about life.

3 perfect strangers sitting at the piazza consuming ridiculous amounts of belgium beer. It was nice. 

I have to remind myself to stop drinking beer. It does not go well with my system. 

Tomorrow morning I leave on a 7 hour train journey up North to go see the kids and stay with them for 2 weeks. I miss them so much. 

I am okay. I got some perspective thinking done. No more dwelling on things I have no control over. This journal will soon cease to end for its chapter in my life has finished. 

When the whole adventure with school starts and being in a town I have never been before begins I will get the new journal. 

I am still sad its just that.. There is nothing I can do. And I am okay with that. This year has been hard because I have cut off so many people from my life all because there is nothing I can do about certain situations. I have had enough of going out of my way trying to preserve friendships that do not deserve it. 

I guess its life. And I guess when you are 20 you start your real life adventure. You let go being a child and start being an adult, or at least try to. I know good things are ahead, and with a little hope, and a little bit of faith, everything is possible.

My heart always has an open door. My heart is big. And it can tolerate alot. It suffers, but only because it cares and I realized I am lucky that I have not frozen up, that I still feel. 

Because sometimes having heart, is the most important thing a person can have."

"event","I am severely hurting. I have not felt hurt this bad in a long time. The kind of hurt that I need to bleed, the kind of hurt I need to punch walls. The kind of hurt I feel my insides perishing. My aunt took me shopping today. She saw me and she was like.. something isnt right. No kidding. Try getting your heart broken.

I guess part of me just wanted her to say yes so badly I did not think what would happen if she said no. And when she did, when the words ""Its over for me"" came sinking in, I cried a solid hour. I have not cried in a long time. Anger replaces tears. I cried today. I put my Damien Rice cd. And I cried some more. Because I really do love that girl, probably the most realistic kind of love I have ever felt. ""I am sorry but I do not feel the same way for"" ""At least I am being honest with you"". 


Yeah.. honesty goes a long way. How did it come to this? What was I expecting? It was like diving off a cliff without a parachute. 

I do not know where to go from here. It is time to just let go of everything I have ever known. It is time to start a new life, a fresh new start, with my new broken heart. I know good things will come in time. I know that. But I have never been so good with loneliness and melancholy. I fear of the things I can do when it comes to this. 

She was... the long awaited smile. A sight to see. The girl in jeans, with a betty shirt and her black jacket at the history section of the book shop. When my hand touched hers, I began to quiver. It was so intense. She took me home, and she kissed me. We stayed in bed all morning even though she had to be at work and I remember her smile that morning as it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Goodbye princess, you were one of a kind."

"event","Monday I am leaving for up North and will only be back in Rome for September. 


I put my heart out in the universe only to have it returned once again broken. I guess to some people, 14 months mean nothing. I guess, deep down inside I knew she never loved me, at least not the way I love her. I guess, enough is enough and when it is over, it is over. Because I realize now, it her loss. No longer mine.

So the heart broken, returned will be bigger once healed. And who ever will win it next will get the best of me.

For now. Enough. School starts October 17 and I cannot wait."

Picking at a worried seam
Itry to make you mad at me over the phone.
Red eyes and fire and signs
I'm taken by a nursery rhyme
I want to make a ray of sunshine and never leave home

<b>No amount of coffee, no amount of crying
No amount of whiskey, no amount of wine
No, nothing else will do

I'm the new chicken clucking open hearts and ears
Oh, such a prima donna, sorry for myself
But green, it is also summer 
And I won't be warm till I'm lying in your arms

Lying in the back of the blue boat, humming a tune..."

"event","I have just read my whole journal and I have come to the conclusion that I am just a pathetic piece of space. And that I was not always like this. And this is definately not who I want to be. I am so much better than that. And if you really knew me, you would know that because you would know my heart and my soul and the purity of it. And not the corrupted infected waste of space I have become. 

Now. I broke up with my girlfriend because it was the right thing to do. Because she had to sort her problems, because I could not carry the weight of her broken heart. If she wants to run away from it again, and start another relationship and get someone else to fall in love with her and live a lie. And that person will get hurt, she will end up in the same place as she was with me. Except I dont know how many people will tolerate having your gf in your arms and as she sleeps calling out the name of her ex. 

Enough. You want to know the truth? I still love you with every bit of my heart and I would do anything to have you back. But not until you let her go. Because I am seconds away from giving you my everything, to letting go everyone else so that you and I can have a future but for now you dont deserve that.

I am better than that and I will stop hurting."

"event","Dear you,
You have just come online. I am staring at your user name, having a conversation with myself. I would not even know what to say to you. I would not want to know what you would have to say to me. Is that not strange? How I wish I could see you but in reality I would stand frozen in front of you with a thousand thoughts running through my head. There you are. Say something to me. Anything. I am just scared. Do not ask me of what for I do not know the answer. The pinch became a bruise and now it is a scar and I realize it is too late to take it all back even though I would not dream of taking it back. Because it is all true. These feelings for you. Which I am trying so very hard to forget, to let go because they do not make sense. And all I do is embarass myself. But I cannot stop them, it is a force stronger than me. And I am weak. I am weakened. By you and all that you are and all that I think you are. But the truth is, I do not even know what your favourite colour is, nor your favourite food. Truth is, I know nothing about you. I have been told not to communicate with you, to just let you be. And I am trying so very hard. I am trying so very hard. And even though I am dying just to say hello in the hope that there is a chance you would respond and we would have a nonsensical conversation, I will not. I will sit here, with my stomach in a twist, my heart in my throat and my feet nervously shaking. I will sit here. Trying to breathe. So I will sit here, listening to Rachel Yamagata telling me how everybody is saying I cannot be your love but I want to be your love. Because if I could take you away, and pretend I was Queen I wonder what you would say. 

Want to be your everything
Everything...
Everything's falling, and I am included in that
Oh, how I try to be just okay
Yeah, but all I ever really wanted
Was a little piece of you

Everything will be alright."

And I was like when do you start school? And she was like Ill start school when I feel like starting school. So I was like.. do you want to come help me settle up north and she was like... you shouldnt even be asking me that, you know im coming.

I thought I could get away without my mind and internal organs noticing but sadly my conscious has led me back here. There is one girl I did not mention. But I did not do it on purpose, and it would be wrong to put her with the others because I dont know.

Its just that I met her 3 years ago, tried to get to know her, failed, fast forward 2 years, find out shes my then gf best friend, who just happened to also be her ex gf, i mean things could not have been worse.

fast forward a few months, throw in some jealousy, one night of drunkeness and realization, followed by dancing and a lapdance. horror and nightmare yet evoking and appetizing and i dont know.

i dont know. i went and wrote a frikking book trying to figure out. i just need to get to know her. cant let it go otherwise. she just needs to say yes and i will do the rest."

2-3 weeks in rome. then 2 weeks on the boat in sardegna, then a few weeks at a beach in tuscany.. its a wonderful job.

and oh my days what a story.
the mother of the kids had an affair with the upstairs neighbour, and his wife and her husband eventually found out. so they both left their families to live together. the kids are 3 and 5 and they dont know. so the mom stays in the house til 10 at night goes to her lover and returns at 6am before the kids wake up. and shes so torn between choosing the love of her life or her family. so not only have i become nanny to the kids ill also be emotional support for both parents - now i dont know how these situations follow me around but hey, im loving it.

i pity the husband. hes so broken and fragile. and the mom is really hot. sigh. so she has til september to decide.

moral of the story : YOU DO NOT GET MARRIED UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT YOURE MARRYING THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE AND THAT NO OTHER COULD EVER REPLACE HIM. hint.

Tomorrow a friend of my ex is going to be coming to see me in Rome and she""ll be spending a few days here with me. Im so excited because i finally have someone to go out with at night and check out the hot spots.

My cousin is hot.

Hmmm.
Anyways. Besides my little outbursts of insanity here and there... Im trying to forget everything Ive left behind. But sometimes its not that easy. But im ok- im happy and im free.

What more should I ask for?"

But, the strongest of us, the most determined of us, holds on to the dream or we find ourselves faced with a fresh dream we never considered. We wake to find ourselves, against all odds, feeling hopeful. And, if we're lucky, we realize in the face of everything, in the face of life the true dream is being able to dream at all."""

Talking with 28 year olds.

Their a whole different species I must say.
I got called little baby today. I'm 20. I'm not 10. 
Oh well. I guess 20 to them was well actually is a decade away.

Maybe all my father's psychological talk is getting to me.
Maybe I'm slightly more open to be in a male-female relationship.

But not anytime soon.
God I hope I'm not getting into ANY sort of relationship anytime soon.

I'm going to fly kites and let them whisk me wherever the wind takes me.

Could one really find happiness without having to look for it?

The days pass by fast here. The sun rises at 5am. By 9am you feel like it's noon. 

I can't wait to arrive in Italy. Just 10 more days and a whole new world of possibilities and adventures await me.

Will I play soccer? Get a chance at Nationals?
Will I study in Milan? Or will I end up in Barcelona?
Am I going to find love? Or is love going to find me?
Will I have a roof on my head?
Will I live the life I always hoped and imagined?
Will I be free from my past?
Will I be ready for the future?
Will I find peace?
Better. Stronger. Faster.

Life, I am ready for you.

whether it is right or wrong, i am not sure.
i just know that right now, it's what i need.

life starts today. on my own two feet.
no one to catch me if i fall.

it's time to get rid of the excess baggage.
it's time to forget the forgotten promises of others.
it's time to let go of the things i don't like but i clinged on to for the sake's of others.

it's time for me.
it's time to organize my life.

i don't want to be the same mess i am and have been when im 25.
i want to have my feet firmly on the ground.
with a destination set and with goals accomplished.

I've been reading the L Word recaps for season 4 and they make me so nostalgic. You know one thing I've learned throughout these years is how to block out people who hurt me. Yet there are days or moments where a thought comes to mind. And it shakes your entire being and knocks you out of your comfort zone until you find your equilibrium. Such is life I pressume.

to fill in the holes within her soul
it wasn't always like this
and if everything has to be a battle
you have to do
what you have to do
put your armour on
and stand strong
anything to feel like you belong
the sun may not always shine
but look up at the sky
and i'll be there
look up at the sky
and you will find the light
you'll feel like you belong
tell me what it is that you seek
what it is that you need
nothing is lost
it's just lost in time
i've been there before."

"event","I got birthday wishes from Ashley and Christina.
I didn't expect it. Especially not from Ashley but she remembered.. :) Seems like this year is going to be a good one and the only problem I'll have is my family. 

It's just so hard to let go of that image of us has a happy family. Ever since my dad got transferred everything turned upside down and all I have is vague recollections of when I was 5-6 years old where we were happy. Truly happy. 

I just want things to go back the way they were. As the years are passing both cultures and religions keep clashing, the money problem isn't helping and neither is being divided. But when my mom and dad are in the same country let alone under the same roof all hell breaks loose. 

All I've ever wanted was just to be a part of a normal family, lead a normal life and just be content. I just need a little bit of tranquility and stability. That is all.

You know, I get so fucking sick and tired of people labelling me just because I'm half white and half asian. I'm so sick of being put under catergories just because my mother is of royal blood and my father is white. 

They can't stand each other now for those facts because my father won't accept my mother's princess lifestyle and my mother won't stop calling my father a farmer because he comes from a small town with no royal blood.

I wish they both just stuffed socks in their mouths and shut up and quit trying to drag us into this. I associate myself more with my european side because it's less repressed, less pretentious and because I have only happy memories of Italy. I hate that we moved. Everything changed, and everything went wrong. 

Sure there are few things I'm thankful for... but still. Ever since I moved, I changed so much. I use to be the happiest kid in the world who didn't have a care in the world. I like wearing pretty dresses and danced about has if no one was watching. Now I'm a total mess, a time bomb waiting to explode, closed up within the cages of my heart because I fear hurting someone or being rejected. I can barely speak my mind without having some sort of anxiety attack.

The past 13 years in KL have destroyed me. And everytime I try to recollect the pieces something else happens. No one gets this. And I wish sometimes everyone left me alone and stopped asking questions. I wish I could erase so many dreadful memories that just haunt me at night when I can't sleep. I just want to move forward. I don't want to look back anymore. I just want to let go and be free. 

Great my nose is bleeding."

I wrote another song during the weekend.

I had a decent birthday. My baby just got the 18 roses I got delivered to her office for our one year anniversary today :D

My dad got me flowers for my birthday. So did his friend. And her daughter got me a shirt. The medicine I'm taking is making me bleuch. I'm pretty much house bound for the next few weeks not to mention my period is coming. Trying to see if we can go to the mountains this weekend so I can go horse riding. It's been too long. I can't wait.

I think very soon I'm going to declare myself orphan. I can't wait to go to Italy and just start my life. I can't wait. I can't wait to play football, I can't wait to go to school, I can't wait to live my life the way I see fit without anyone coming along and making a mess of things. I just want tranquility and stability.

"event","I get weirdest dreams sometimes.
I'm so glad my real life isn't even half as complicated as my dream my life. I get the strangest people popping up in my dreams. Last night I had a high school flashback. It involved the seaside, fancy hotel, and swimming out to sea in search of something or someone, then a detailed high speed chase in some fancy cars. Strange strange strange.

I woke up and tried to call my baby but some woman kept talking in Russian. Sometimes the phone picks up other people's conversations. So I text her and tell her to go on gmail. She said she couldn't since she was already home. So I sat here wondering... why is she home at 2pm? Then I was thinking, maybe being buddy buddy with her boss is doing some good despite making me go hysterical. And she was like.. umm.. because.. it's.. SATURDAY. Oh.. yeah huh. Whhoooppss. I don't even know where the days go here.. It's been a month already since I've left.

So yesterday my friend Marina, from Malaysia took me to the ballet with her daughter and her brother.. We watched the Hunchback of Notre Dame. It was super duper beautiful. And heart wrenching.. and the costumes were extravagant full of vibrant colours.. and you really felt sad Esmerelda. 

Marina is going to be bringing back some things for me to pass to my baby and my mom. The most amusing thing happened to me yesterday despite the madness.

So I've been prescribed these herbal tranquilizers because my liver and digestive system really cannot take anymore stress or emotional anxiety and yesterday since I was fuming with anger I thought I'd give it a try. I popped these 2 green pills and suddenly the world was all colourful and pretty. Even when I was upset with my girlfriend I went out and got her a few little presents here and there. I think their made of grass or something.. I was all smiley and la la la la smurf like happy. I like those pills.

I'm so picky when I buy things... So I got her 3 little gifts of different things hoping that at least she'll like one. I was hoping to fly her to Italy this year but she's barely got any leave left.

With every gift I always have to outdo the last.. It's how I work. I love wrapping. I love going to wrapping shops. My favourite is Russ in One Utama. They always please me. 

I'm so excited... I can't wait... <3333 One day to my birthday, two days to our anniversary!!!

I briefly remembered I had read up on them when we studied the blooming 20's of America in highschool. 2 weeks ago we watched One Flew Over The Coockoo's Nest. Now that was a rather brilliant movie. Sad, and tragic yet had profound meaning to the word true friendship.

Today I got rather PISSED mad... I haven't been pissed mad in a long time. I ended up walking out of the internet cafe in the -20 weather, walked about for 20m and realized I couldn't feel my face so hopped in a cab home even if it was like 200m away.

At dinner had some good wine and port and let go of today's events. 


good night.
waking up at 4:30am and going on a road trip with dad over the mountains and into another valley.

"event","My mother use to tell me that friendships come and go. But I guess inside, I always hoped that some would last forever. 

There are few people who I hold so dear to heart. These are people that have always accepted for who I am and who have always been there for me over the years. There are a few who were there for me for my toughest times and there are a few who were with me for my happiest times.

And then there are the friends you've known your whole life, and you know that even if years pass by, you could see them tomorrow and nothing changes.

But there's always been one friend who I hold to the highest of regards. I even think of her as my other half because I barely function without her. People use to say we were joint at the hip. We grew up together. We did everything together. Her family was like my extended family. We spent hours on the phone studying for our O Level history paper and we both walked away with A's. When she got locked out of her house at 5am I went to get her in a cab even though I had a soccer tournament and had to be up by 6am. When I had stomach cramps and couldn't move she went to get me painkillers. When I needed someone to be there for me, she'd come pick me up and let me stay over where then she'd make instant mash potatoes and fry up some sausages. When she needed to throw up I helped her get to the hotel toilet. When I needed to throw up she slapped my face so I wouldn't make a scene at the restaurant. I was the idealistic, she was the realistic. Ying and Yang. Salt and pepper. Tea and milk. We're growing up. We're growing apart and I feel like I'm losing, or maybe I've already lost the most important person in my life. My best friend. Fi. 

We live in 2 separate worlds now. Even our ideals are different I think. I don't know. I just miss her. I really really miss her that I think when I do go to Italy I might fly up to Manchester to surprise her. Because that's what best friends do. Even when you fight, one will stand forth and do everything that it takes to save the friendship. I know I would do anything to save this friendship, and I mean anything. Besides Kara, she was first person I told about not being straight and she was so ok with it and stuck by me through my hardest days of highschool. When everyone bitched about me she stuck by me. Friendships like that don't just get lost. 

We are one. We always use to say.
I miss the summer we went driving around and blasting The Killers  and Kelly Clarkson and singing at the top of our lungs.

Those were the days."

Some things are more than what you say, they're what you do. Some things you say cause there's no other choice. Some things you keep to yourself. And not too often, but every now and then, some things simply speak for themselves.

You have to work out whether your roots are become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the desire to mate every second of the day. It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body. No... don't blush. I am telling you some truths. For that is just being in love; which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over, when being in love has burned away. Doesn't sound very exciting, does it? But it is! </b>

Pelagia: I wrote to you every day. A hundred letters... and not a single reply. 
Mandras: [takes out her letters from his coat] I never learned... to read or write. 

Iannis: [writing to Corelli] Antonio, I do not know if this letter will reach you, or even if you are alive. Perhaps someone else sent your record, and that is why we found no note. I would like to say that Pelagia is happy, but she is full of tears she will not let fall, and of a grief no doctor can mend. She blames herself for the pain we have suffered, and perhaps the same is true for you. You know I am not a religious man, but I believe this: if there is a wound, we must try to heal it. If there is someone whose pain we can cure, we must search till we find them. If the gods have chosen that we should survive, it will be for a reason. 

Pelagia: Why did you save him? Why didn't you leave him to die? 
Mandras: I wanted you to love me again. 
[Pulls out 100 letters] 
Mandras: <b>In Albania, I made them read every one of these to me... 'Mandras, I love you,' 'Mandras, I want you,' 'Mandras, when are you coming back?' And then one day, a different letter. 'I don't know how to describe my feelings. It's as if I have been waiting a hundred years to hear from you, waiting a hundred years for you to return. Once, my heart was overflowing with love for you, but now all I feel is emptiness. And I think it was all just a pretense, that I never loved you at all.' </b>"

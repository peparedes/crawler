"event","1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me."" <br />2. I respond by asking you five personal questions so I can get to know you better ! If I already know you well, expect the questions may be a little more intimate! * <br />3. You WILL update your LJ with the answers to the questions. <br />4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the post. <br />5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jenny Folan, you beast..."">1. How are you feeling about your major today? If it doesn't pan out, what will you do with your life?<br /><br />You caught me between Hell and a tough spot.&nbsp; I've been frustrated because I'm being looked at as the great organizer back stage, but I really want to be known as the great character actor on stage.&nbsp; But then, I just got off the phone with my aunt when I opened this and she's going to put me up for the summer again so that I can work at the Shakespeare Festival in Alabama.&nbsp; If it doesn't pan out, I'd probably go all the well into Business and then open my own bed and breakfast or bookstore...I might do that anyways...<br /><br /><br />2. Your inner child is on the loose! What's she doing?<br /><br />Telling off everyone I hate and kissing the one person that I want to with recklass abandon.&nbsp; She might also be playing outside without sunscreen and just enjoying life in general...of course, I TRY to do that on a regular basis, so I don't know if it counts...<br /><br /><br />3. You can't live without...?<br /><br />Music...it just does something to my stomach and my lungs and my heart that forces words that have a tune to come out.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I ever became deaf, that would be the worst part, because music is so important to me.<br /><br /><br />4. What's something you have to do before you die?<br /><br />That's a hard question for me because there's so many things.&nbsp; I think the number one thing is to see the world.&nbsp; I've always felt so trapped and sheltered where I live, that I just want to get out and see things that I've only seen in pictures...<br /><br /><br />5. What's your biggest fear? WIll you ever get past it?<br /><br />Failure...I can't stand to fail...and there's no getting past it.&nbsp; It's not something I can change and as a theatre major, it's going to be the death of me, I can assure you.<br /><br /></div>"

I am a compulsive liar.  

Not just to other people, but to myself as well.

Anyone who I care about knows that I have no desire to have children and I have no desire to tie myself down to one man for the rest of my life.

But guess what...

...I'm a compulsive liar.

I do want children.  I want a little girl that I can name after my great-grandmother, Katherine Carol.  And I want a little boy that I can name after my uncle, Daniel Richard.

I do want to tie myself down to one man for the rest of my life.  I want to come home to a family that loves me, that wants me to kiss them, look over their homework, and then tuck them in at night.

I want to go to little league games where they can't hit the ball past the infield.  I want to go to dance recitals where all the little girls and boys suck, but not mine BECAUSE she's mine.

I need to stop lying to myself.  I'm NOT contended to die an old maid.  I'm NOT contended to live without having a child of my own.  I'm NOT contended to never my own wedding.

Why is it that I can never make up my mind?"

"event","These past two weeks of class have been just as awesome and wonderful as that first weekend here. 

The Leaderhosen thing that first weekend was fun.  They put names on the back of us and we had to ask other people questions about ourselves to figure out who we were and then find our significant other.  I was Celesiate Flockhart, the chick who played ""Ally McBeal"" and A.J. was my husband, Harrison Ford...A.J. + me = hotness :-P 

That week of school wasn't too bad.  After Modern Dance, I'm gonna have some killer thighs!!!  Shit, those plies are killing me!!  But, it's fun...I'm enjoying it.  Everything that Mahady is going over so far, I learned in Accounting 1 with Mrs. Fochler.  

I got my yearbook last weekend when I went home.  There's this weird picture of me and Ellen at the senior banquet that looks like we're breaking out in song or something.  It's funny.  There's a picture of me and her at the Homecoming dance that I didn't think would get into the yearbook, but it did, which is cool.  Both Mum and Dad and Amy left me little notes in the yearbook.  Mum's was cuter than Dad's, but they were both the first ones on the pages, so I didn't have to go looking for them.

Tuesday morning, they had potate pancakes in the dining hall for breakfast, so I grabbed a bunch in a bowl and put them in a napkin and Jeanette was like, ""Why did you do that?"" and I told her so I could take them to class and eat them there since we were running out of time and she was like, ""Oh, okay.""  So we were doing this thing in Thinking and Writing about current events and she looked over at me and saw me chewing and asked me if I was eating my pancakes.  I nodded and said ""I'm a fat girl.  I need my food.""  So that's been our thing everysince.  I imed her last night and said ""I'm a fat girl...I need my food...what time do you want to fulfill my fat girl needs tomorrow morning?""  Basically, I asked her what time did she want to meet me outside of her dorm to go to breakfast.  Oh vey...

Auditions were on Tuesday for ""Mazel"" and the Chekhov One-Acts.  Oh vey...so, half-way thorough my monologue, I blanked.  I mean, I could not remember a thing until I actually looked it up.  So, I walked out, walked over to a tree, cried a few tears and then decided to go back in.  I was so pissed at myself.  So, I saw Jeanette was getting to walk out and I told her I would walk back up with her.  When she got outside, she pulled out her cigerettes like she always does and I looked over at her and I was like, ""Can I have one, please?""  She stopped and looked at me, like ""WHAT???""  I had had a drag of one of hers that first weekend and I told her that I had never smoked before and she gave me one and that was it.  So when I told her I wanted one, she nearly shit herself.  I just said ""Just give me a goddamn cigerette, Jeanette."" And she was like, ""Ok, ok, here...""  We've been joking about it for like, a week now.  That's how pissed off I was at my audition...gah...so then, we watched ""Thirteen"" in her room, which is a really fucked up movie.  Then we walked over to Havey so she could see J.T. and I went to hang out with A.J. because he always knows how to make me feel better.  He's my comfort.  So, then I read some stuff for acting, went back to my room and forgot about the audition.

So, the next morning, I imed Matt because we knew Karen might have jury duty, so I asked him if we did and he said, no, have you seen the callback list yet?  When I told him no, he told me that I got and I was just like, ""Are you shitting me?"" But no, after I blanked a minute into my monologue, I still got a callback, so I was all pumped for that.  Went to classes that day, went to my work-study training, then went back to my room to change, and then went to callbacks.  I felt really good about it.  

Then, Matt, Natalie, Daniella, and I got pizza and watched some of ""Into the Woods"" with Berendette Peters (I HEART HER!!!) It was so funny...Matt said he was too fat to be a Holocaust survivor, which is what ""Mazel"" is about and then he shoved a spoonful of Marshmallow Fluff into his mouth.  We busted out laughing.

This is the conclusion I've come to about callbacks: they've called me back for two reasons: either they think I'm horrible and they want to laugh at me somemore, in which case, I'm happy to provide a good laugh, or they see potenial in me, in which case, I'm happy to come back...either way, they called me back.

So, Jeanette and I went over to see the cast list this morning with Natalie.  Jeanette got cast in ""Mazel"" as a survivor (Yea Jeanette), A.J. got cast as understudy for the lead guy, who will be played by an equity actor (BIG YEA!!!!!!!! FOR A.J.).  I was disappointed, but I'm majoring in theatre now, it's not like that's the only chance I'll get to do acting stuff this year.  It's not like high school musicals.  So, then at the book discussion, I saw Terry and I had mentioned to him at the department meeting at his house last week how I would be interested in being a stage manager if he needed one and I wasn't cast.  I guess that stuck, because he told me to talk to Ken about it, who is my production teacher.  So, at Production today, after the discussion, I mentioned it to him about how I would be interested in stage managing and he said he had just sent me an e-mail about it and since I'll be doing it for ""Mazel,"" while ""Mazel"" is in production, I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO PRODUCTION CLASS!!!!!!!  BIATCHES RIGHT!!!!

I'm so happy, this is going awesome, I LOVE it here!!!"

"event","So far, this experience has been everything I've ever wanted out of college...

I am so completely satisfied with what I've been doing that I truly see no reason for me to want it to change.  

For instance...

...last night...

...this was kinda gay...

...they had some playfair thing which was a quick way to meet 50 people in 5 minutes...not fun...so, I snuck out with Daniella and Rose and some other chicks and Daniella and Rose ended up in my room and we watched ""Little Women,"" which I totally ruined with my word vomit and 11:30 p.m., 5 hours of sleep giddiness..butchered the poor thing...and then Marie and Alex, two of my suitemates joined us, so it was all good and fun...

...and then...

...tonight...

...there was this Relationships 411...basically, it was how not to get raped on campus...so, my suitemates and I, along with Mia's mum, who is a gem, decided we would go to Walmart because there was a major list of things we needed.  So, we went, then we got back and I decided after wandering around my suite aimlessly, since we have no cable, to go meet up with Matt, who had just gone back to his dorm (I found that out just as I walked past, which was nifty).  So, we got together, we came back to my suite since it's air conditioned and he was jealous and then we went to the library, where we met up with a bunch of other theatre people.  I ate dinner with seven other people, all of whom were theatre majors as I was.  After that, Matt and I decided to watch a movie, either in Brownlee if it was VHS or on my computer since it can play DVDS.  We ended up watching, like, half of ""Little Shop of Horrors"" with AJ, another theatre guy, who is musical theatre.  Then the three of us headed over to the Admin building for ice cream and a talent show, which was great.  Then, Matt and I decided we didn't want to watch the magician, so he walked me back to my dorm, which is past his mind you, then he said he would knock on my window when he was ready.  So, he did and we proved just how easy it is to break into Suite 104 in DeChantal Hall...yea, pretty damn easy.  So, then we were gonna go over to the next to Brownlee, but some guy yelled Monty Python at us from his girlfriend's window.  They were both musical theatre majors.  

I swear, pure serendipity.

So, then, we went to the little dance, which was kind of pathetic.  AJ, Matt, and I then headed up to AJ's room to hang...we ended up talking about musicals for a good 45 minutes.  Then, Matt and I left because we both have some leader thing in the morning.  Anyways, he ended up staying in my room and talking for about another thirty minutes and then he left.  

Seriously, this has got to be the best time ever.  If it just stayed like this for the rest of the four years I'm here, I would have no complaints.  The walk to and from the buildings is fine (for now until the snow hits) and the food is better than it was at orientation and...just...everything is perfect.  I don't think it could've been like this anywhere else."

"event","I feel like everything I knew is ending...which, in reality, it is. 

I've been planning stuff with my suite mates.  They all sound great so far.  I'm just worried that when I come back over Christmas or something that I'll have completely changed who I am and I don't want that.  

I like who I am...to an extent.  

I like the fact that I'm obsessed with musicals and that I randomly look at new ones on Myspace, then become addicted to them.  I like the fact that I think children are adorable until they wake up.  I like the fact that I've never gotten drunk and that I'm still a virgin and that the only true penis I've ever seen on a male human has been on a four year old boy when I gave him his bath.

But, then I look closer and I don't like who I am.

I don't like how I'm so lazy.  I don't like how I'm overweight.  I don't like how I'm constantly losing my temper.  I don't like how much I want to learn things, but I don't.  I don't like how uninspired I am at times.

I hate the fact that my mum's side of the family and my dad's side of the family are complete opposites.  I hate the fact that my mum talks about my dad's family constantly.  I hate the fact that my closest friends are 40 minutes away and none of us have had anytime to get together to see each other since school ended.

Actually...

...thinking about it...

...they haven't had time to get together with me, but plenty of time to get together with each other.  Nikki has no problems driving two hours to get Will and Adam to see them.  Adam claims it's too far to come to my graduation party (2 hours) whereas it's about the same from his house to Ellen's.  

I feel let down by so many people that I thought were the ones I could count on.  I hear news second-hand from people who aren't even in our circle. 

Things were going great...I was excited about school, I was doing fine at work, I was satisfied with what I had.  And now I'm not.  I think I need to stop watching ""Gilmore Girls.""  That's my problem.  I think all these is rooted in my worries that my mum and I are gonna separate majorly and I really don't want that.  She's my life support.  I can't just leave her behind.  

The whole entry is based off of that, but the complaints are real.  I hate the fact that whenever I complain about one thing, everything else comes out."

"event","Gah!!!  This is my proclamation to EVERYONE here and now that I will never, NEVER have children of my own.  I will adopt if I feel that true maternal urge...probably from some English speaking country, where there is a lone 12 year old girl who wants a mum...but never will a member of the human race come out of my vagina...

I just don't understand this people that pop out, like, 5 of them and then are so thrilled because they get to spend time with the kids.

It's weird...like, a year ago, I was all, ""Yea, I want kids.  No, I'm not like my mum, I'll actually want them!""  And now, I'm just like, get them out of my sight!  It's disturbing how quickly my decisions like that change.  

So, anyways, this comes after the little boy I'm babysitting, Alex, who is 4, basically told me, in a fit of rage, that he wanted me to get skin cancer.  We had gone down to his one friends house to see if she could play (she doesn't have cooties yet) and when she couldn't, he wouldn't go see if his other friend could come out.  He basically stood in her yard for a good 20 minutes and told me he just wanted to stand out there.  This was at 2 o'clock.  I told him no, I wouldn't and picked him up, kicking and screaming, and sat him down on the couch, where he fell asleep.  His older brother is at a birthday till 4, so until Alex wakes up or Chris gets home, I am free to sit on my computer and shit around or I could actually do something for school...

Last night, Mum and I went school shopping.  At Sam's club, I flirted shame- and guilt-lessly with the cashier.  Then, at Walmart, we couldn't find extra-long sheets, which makes me mad, but we did find a cute little 5-cup coffee maker, toaster, and hot pot in black or red, which makes me happy!  So, most of my college stuff is bought.  I still have to get in touch with three of my five suitemates.  I talked with Marie on the phone the other day, but I had to cut it short because Alex was goofing off and wanted a snack.  I've been messaging with Mia on facebook.  I <3 that chica already.  I <3 Asians at this point and their rice dependence.  

Then, this morning, I was actually out of the house before 11.  I was out of the house at 7:30 to be exact.  I drove up to Cresson for Lilly Community Days with Ma and Ellen.  That was fun.  I got two pair of jeans that don't fit, a pair of shorts that would fit if I gained 20 pounds, which I refuse to do, and 2 cds that I'm excited about.  Sometimes I hate yardsales, sometimes I <3 them.  Today was a mixed day."

"event","So, today, Elliott and I went over to Lakemont to see Dad, Amy, Adam and Renata, my new half-siblings from Poland.

Complete rip-off: they said that you had to park in the garage, yet you had to PAY to park there!!!  WTF!!!!  And apparently, even if you work there, you still have to pay to get it...grrr...stupid people leading us on...

But otherwise, the day was awesome...Renata attached to me when we got in the park and wouldn't let go for most of the day...it was swell...I think I've ridden ever ride in Kiddieland that an adult can ride today...Renata found out she was too little for the swings and I thought there was a little one in Kiddieland, so Amy and I took her up...turns out there isn't, but she enjoyed it anyways...Amy ended up riding some stuff with Adam (who is fondly referred to as Adish by the family...no clue...) and I ended up running all over Kiddieland with Renata...we rode the little rollar coaster a bunch of times (you have no idea how steep that thing really is...it's crazy)...she loved the little airplanes and boats they had...though she did look kinda bored on them, but, hey, whatever, she wanted to keep doing them...

It's weird how much they actually understand...

Oh, best part of the day...

Adam, Renata, Elliott, and Dad ('tata' in Polish) were standing in line for the Skyliner (Amy and I were too sick from the previous ride [the red one by the Scrambler {NEVER RIDE THAT!!!!!}]) and Dad said that Renata just started saying ""Do-Re-Mi-Fa-La-Ti-Do"" except instead of ""Ti"" she would say ""Si.""  So we were standing in line for the bumper cars one last time before leaving and she and I are just messing around with it.  We'd say ""Do"" back and forth to each other just randomly and I'd start singing ""Old McDonald..."" and she'd join in occasionally...

They're so cute...they got us Polish chocolate before they left Warsaw, which they gave us when they met us...it was cute...I went to eat my chocolate bar before we left and I broke a piece off for Adam to give to him...Renata was in the bathroom, so I saved a little bit for her and I went to hand it to her.  She went to take a bite and before she did, she looked at me and said ""Adam?""  I don't think I've ever seen two kids share as much as they do...Dad bought kettle corn before we left and Adam had the bag and he'd just randomly hand stuff over to her and me...it's crazy...I know Elliott and I NEVER shared that much when we were that age...

Anyways, it's ten to eleven and I am beat and this massive sunburn on my back from Tuesday isn't helping, so I will leave cyber world to it's night owls..."

"event","Why do I keep doing this to myself?  I have told myself time and time again that I am okay with just hooking-up with someone.  

And then, something like tonight happens.

A friend and I had been invited to go to the movies with two friends of mine from work.  They would be done around six, when the park closed and they would call me to verify what time the movie was we were going to see.  So, I'm sitting at home, I'm doing things around the house for my mum, since she went on a cleaning spree.  Finally around 4:30, I called my friend and told her that we should go to the 7:00 show no matter what.  Then, when I get back to my computer, she ims me to let me know that she won't be able to make it because she got in trouble with her mum.  So, I'm like, okay.  By 6:45, they hadn't called and my mum wanted to go to Target, so I left.

Now, this may not seem like it was a big deal, but to me, the person who foolish builds things up in her head, when she knows that it will only let her down, it is.  And I hate that I do this to myself.  

Digression: How long was Belle in the castle before she went home?  Was she there over Christmas?  Sweet Oz, someone explain this to me, please...

Back to topic: I think what makes me feel worse about it is that I lied to my mum about it.  The two friends from work were guy friends and I had no desire to tell my mum that, lest she make a big deal out of it, especially since one is 24 and the other is 20 (though she has told me that she doesn't care how old the guy is, as long as he respects me).  She was really good about me telling her the truth.  I think that the fact that it didn't happen was what made it better.

But anyways, at Target, I finally got my own digi camera with a printer and mummy bought me a bathrobe for school.  But then, we went to try on jeans, because I have three pairs that I love that have holes in the butt because I have thunder thighs.  So, I go to the jeans and I get a 15 and a 17, thinking, okay, the 15 is just in case and the 17 is the one that will fit.  No, I was wrong.  Apparently, my ass and stomach have grown so large in the past year or so that I don't even fit into a 17 anymore.

I hope that college makes things better.  There's just no point to school if I'm gonna be stuck the way I am the rest of my life.  I feel so tied down here.  My father is telling me, okay, you're an adult, so you don't have to go to bed at 11, you don't have to go to church, but you have to set an example for Adam and Renata.  I hate that he is using a 9- and a 7-year old to keep my within his rules.  My mother is still treating me like she did when I got home last summer.  I've graduated from high school, I should be able to stay out later.  

So, in order to feel better about myself, I am going to watch ""Beauty and the Beast"" and at least pretend to be as an amazing singer as Paige O'Hara..."

"event","I was looking under my bed for a little trinket for Reneta since I got a little Matchbox car for Adam and I found some of my journals that I was writing in.  I had this problem where I would start one journal, but I'm obsessed with collecting notebooks of any kind, so I would find another one I like, buy it, forget the other one, and start writing in the new one, only to abandon that one for a new one.  But I digress.

So, I found journals that I had written in and I got sidetracked and started reading through some of them.  And while reading, I found how hilariously dramatic I was, even into my sophomore year about things.  I was so obsessed with having a boyfriend.  I wrote a two page entry about finding out my one ""boyfriend"" was bi-sexual.  And then I proceeded to write another two page entry a couple of weeks later about how pissed I was when my dad and step-mum found out because they printed out an im where another friend told me she was bi-sexual as well.

And then, I would just abandon it and start another one.  I have entries from deciding on whether I should move out here or should have stayed with my dad...

Why do I do this to myself?  All the fucking time...I build things up in my head, expecting things to happen because they were going wonderful...

I hate myself sometimes..."

This morning, I went over to the Sheetz Family Medical center for my meningitis shot, but I couldn't get it, so that's okay...

Then, I went over to the mall to do my contact fitting.  Then, I had to stay in Altoona until 1 for my voice lesson, so I just hung out at the mall.  I was in Waldenbooks and got a book, and guys...it's official...I am a Rent-head...I bought the book /Without You/ by Anthony Rapp, the guy who plays Mark in the movie and the original Broadway show...so that was cool...

When I went to go get cash from the bank, the teller asked me for id...wtf is with that?  I've never been asked for my id before, which is weird, but okay...

So, then I had Chinese for lunch and went to my voice lesson...

Ended up there 20 minutes before, so I sat in my car and practiced and then Susie showed up, so I just kept practicing until 1.

I went in and, of course, my mutant tongue gets in the way of my awesome, ""pure"" voice (Susie's word, not mine).  So, after I warmed up and little and we talked about my mutant tongue, she had me do ""Only Hope,"" which is a song from ""A Walk to Remember.""  And, by God, it was awesome!!! 

I've been having so much trouble with the rhythms for that damn song because I can't read 6/8 for shit and so, when I finished, she just looked at me and said all this stuff about how she has such a range of singers from unbelievable to unbelievably bad and I'm standing there, thinking, Okay, and your point?  and then she goes on to say ""...and that was the best I have ever heard that song.""

BIG SMILE!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh, yeah...

So, now, I have to go get ready for work, but hey, life is good, and I'm not gonna get any worse on purpose..."

"event","For the first time in a long while, things are actually going good for me.  I feel good, like actually happy.  I'm not crying constantly.  I mean, yea, work sucks, but that's life, oh well.

After I dropped Elliott off at camp, I went out to my dad and talked to him about my graduation party.  I'm really glad that things got cleared up about that.  He was completely understanding about my fears of Adam and Renata taking over the party.  Although, I'm not sure if they're plan to only let them stay for half a hour was more for their benefit or mine, but either way it works.  I'm not expected to pay for the party and I'm actually kind of excited about it now.

Still haven't talked to any of my room mates, but I did find a girl on Myspace that is in the suite next to me.  That's kinda cool.  

You know, for as much as people bash Myspace, it really is awesome.  I think I'm gonna have a better first few weeks of college in the fall because I've actually talked with someone who isn't in my suite.  It gives me a reason to leave my suite except for class and food.

The only part of my life that is semi-crappy is the whole guy point.  Right now, I'm not looking for anything serious, but I'm not ready to give up on my morals.  I'm proud of the fact that I graduated from high school as a virgin.  And no, I don't think that makes me a prude.  I discussed this with Adam a week and a half ago.  The opportunity with someone I would WANT to have sex with has never arisen.  Christ, the right PERSON has never arisen.  But then, flirting with guys is fun, but I want someone that I can go out with, see a good movie, walk around somewhere, have a good conversation with crappy coffee and a cheap place where the lighting is shit, and then have him walk me to more door and when he kisses me, I want butterflies in my stomach.  Honest to God butterflies that mean something.

But, oh well, I am quite happy with where I am at right now.  I just hope I haven't jinxed it by talking about it, not just letting it be..."

"event","I have a theory about crying.  This theory comes from observing two people cry: myself and my mother.  

I tend be a quiet crier.  You can't really tell I'm crying unless I talk to you or you see it in my face or you hear my sniff.  Most of the times I would blow the sniff off as I had just sneezed or some other excuse like that.  I don't like to have people hear my cry.  I believe I have perfected the quiet cry.  

My mother, on the other hand, cries very loud: bawling, deep inhales, moans, those sort of things.  She goes into her room, slams the door, and you can hear her wail it all out.  

Now the theory comes into play.  

I believe that the way you cry can tell a lot about how you release your emotions.  I tend to keep things inside.  I don't tell people how I'm feeling unless I want a pity party.  Most of the times I do, but I still hold it in.  I rarely find a release for it, unless it is something drastic.  This makes the moments I do cry even worse, because there are WEEKS of pent up tension in them.  Everything comes out.  And I've found that crying doesn't make me feel better, it makes me feel worse.  I feel as though, because no one TRIES to hear my cry, no one cares.  So, in the end, it makes nothing better.

My mother, on the other hand, has been told she is abrasive, which is true.  She does not hide her feelings, she lets them all out.  So when she cries, you know that something deeper is bothering her.  She doesn't want comforted, she just wants to cry.  I don't know if it helps her, but she will go in her room and lie on her bed and cry and probably fall asleep at some point in the middle of it.

Two distinct crying techniquies, two not so distinct personalities.  I am my mother's child of course and, as I've been told time and time again, apples don't fall far from the tree; they truly don't.

So, in conclusion, the way you cry depends on your personality.

Comments would be welcomed.

Thank you and goodnight."

"event","Why do people see it as pitiful when you're a single person?  You know why, because of the homo sapians need to reproduce.  Espiecally in this ""civilized"" countries.  Hey, people, we don't need to reproduce, we can just go to Africa.  This way, we're decreasing the surplus population and not creating more fat, little, racist Americans.  Though, by bringing over Africans, we're creating fat, little, racist African-Americans.  

So, is that better or worst?

So, anyways, life is better, I guess.  I've been looking at my past entries and the last one I made that didn't sound like I wanted to kill myself was before prom, which in itself is really depressing.

I just can't wait to get out of this place and find somewhere where no one knows who I am, what my past is, or just where I can start over.  

So, Setonian Day was on Friday...got my summer reading, got my schedule, and found out who my roommates are.  So, when I got my schedule, I originaly had Principle of Accounting 1 at 8 in the morning on Tuesday and Thursday, so Brino-Dean got it moved to 2, which makes me happy.  Unfortunately, Thursdays, I have time for breakfast and dinner and that's it...I go from 9:30, with Production Techonology, to 4:30 with my Production class.  And the main two of those classes are my dance classes.  Gross.  Oh well.  

I'm also in a suite, with three other girls.  Haven't met them yet, or got their info.  Apparently, they were all at the Setonian Day in May, so, oh well...

I don't know, I guess life still kinda sucks, but if it were perfect, as Bridget Jones says, ""...[once] life starts going okay, [it] falls spectacularly to pieces.""  But Will kinda helped.  At Ellen's party, he and I went walking and we talked.  Will and I talked and walked and it helped a little.  Like I told him, it's not something that my friends can fix, it's something that I need to work on myself.  And since I don't share my feelings, I see no reason for my friends to get involved.

I just need to find new people to accept me.  I'm not trying to replace my friends.  They ARE my family and you can't replace your family, but they know me in a certain way and I'm not sure I want to be known that way anymore.

So, is this still kinda depressing or not?  

At least I'm not bawling while I write this..."

Would I be raised to be a Rizzo or a Cinderella or a Maria or a Kim McAfee or a Marian Paroo or a Belle or a Elphaba?  Would I be a better person than who I am?  Would I be worse?  Would the way I would be raise make me more likable?  

...I had stayed at one school my entire life?  Moving around like I have has made me the outgoing person I am, but with all these 'then and now' pictures coming out for the yearbook, it makes me wonder if staying at one school district would help me...would I have more friends or less?  

...my parents had stayed together the first time?  I was five and going to Penn Hills.  It relates to the whole staying in one school district.  Would the fighting have affected me and would I be one of those people who drink and smoke all the time.  I'm not saying that that's why those people do it, or it's wrong, but is the reason it's not part of my personality because of that?  Would I have found relief in drinking and smoking at a young age?



The end of the school year has made me wonder a lot of these things.  

I've also noticed that I tend to compose my blogs in my head before I write them.  And I kept thinking that I want what other people have.

I want...

...what Ellen has...how she seems happy with herself...how she's actually going away somewhere...how she has all these guys enamored with her...how she has all these plans for herself...why can't I have that?  What the fuck is so wrong with me that I can't?

God Lord, I want what my mother has, which, from the outside doesn't seem like a lot.

And, Jenny, as much as I love you, nothing you can say can make this better this time.  It's cutting too deep now.

I feel ugly, fat, and just unwanted.  And there's just too many issues that I have with myself that I can't seem to solve.  As much as I appear to have my life, feelings, and confidence under control, I really don't.  There's just no way that I can help myself until I get out of here for good.  Until I'm gone and know that I'm not coming back in the summers.

"event","Restoration Party

~Mission Statement~
 As the Restoration Party, we hope to procure a government that is ""of the people, by the people, for the people"" through restoring basic American rights of choice and safety.


~Platform:~
In the area of foreign relations, we believe that the United States should pull out all troops in Iraq.  We also believe that the United States should leave the United Nations.

In the area of abortion, we believe in pro-choice, but against partial birth.

In the area of engery, we believe that we should find domestic products that are environmental safe.

In the area of education, we believe that there should be federal control over teacher's salaries.  The 'No Child Left Behind' Act must be reformed.  We will do this by slowly weaning children off of their aids.  We will also support the music and arts programs.

In the area of immigration, we believe there should be a quota for all legal immigrants coming in.  We will also send all illegal immigrants back to their original country and place out a FBI warning on all those who are caught. 

In the area of power of the Supreme Court, we believe that their power to decide social issues should be left alone, but we believe that the Supreme Court members should be elected for life terms.

In the area of domestic policy, we believe in gay rights.  They whould have the ability to adopt as a couple, as well as health benefits as a married couple.  We also believe that gas prices should be regulate by the government.  We believe in stem cell research.  We also believe in the death penalty.  We believe that welfare should be reformed.  We will start this by looking at each case on file.  We believe that more financial aid should be made available to those deserving it.  We also believe that social security money shuld not be taken out for any purpose except for social security.  Social security will not be supplied until retirement.  We do not believe in affimative action.


~Plan of Action~
We plan to permeate the branches of government by using the American peopl's God given right to vote through campaigning in conjunction with the media.  We will first filter through the city governments, allowing people to come to an understandinga bout our ideas and philosophy.  We'll reform the school districts and the job ration in the areas where we are elected.  AFter fimly convincing the area that we are the best for the job, we will slowly move our way up the political ladder, gaining trust, and respect from the voters.


~Goals~
Our goal is to restore American rights.  We aspire toe educate the AMerican people and give them more job opportunities.  We expect to lower the national debt and help the American people become more self-sufficient.





All for you my love...MUAH!!!"

"event","Let me tell you how much fun that was...

...not much...

We finally hammered out a new date for graduation, that, although not what we wanted, is a good comprimise.  I just feel so bad for Mr. Monica.  That school board hates him.  God, Auggie Doggie is just such an asshole.  I really don't see why the school board hired him...except for the fact that they all seem to agree with him.  

I just think it's funny how no one wanted to second the motion to have graduation on the 30th.  Mrs. Behe gave us a thumbs up when that happened.  

I'm so proud of my little Bogen, standing up in front of the big mean school board to defend us all.

I am a little disappointed in the senior student body though.  At least 20 people said they were gonna show up and only 9 of us showed up.  That just pisses me off.  If you say you're gonna show up somewhere in support of something you believe in, then do it.  I understand Renee not showing up, because she herself admited that she would get out of hand, so she decided not to ruin it all for us, but other people could've shown their little faces.

But I'm so happy that Mr. Petyak showed up.  All the board members kinda got shook up when they saw him come in.  They knew who he was and that we had him.  Oh, it was great.  But Mr. Roberts was a butthead.  He and Mr. Pyo like to argue and ruin people's hopes and dreams.  Urgh...

At least now, my dad can come with having to worry about missing work...and the rest of my family can come to...so that's something I'm happy about...

So, June 3rd, 2006 at 1:30 on the Penn Cambria Football Field...be there and be prepared to celebrate!!!!"

I feel like one big screw up. I don't know to manage. Why can people with it so much harder than me manage, but I can't. I hate that I cry over this. Every week, I let you down, I'm spoiled and selfish and your giving and loving. I try to be more like you, but I can't live up to it. I'm sorry."

"event","So I'm done complaining about how I can't handle anything (Parking, picnic basket) wow what am I going to do when theres a real crisis? So I'm excited to run away from the stresses that are molehills that I made into mountains. I'm running to Orlando for the weekend, to be with the two men of my life... (Ok yeah that sounded cheesy) My daddy is going to be in Deland for a meeting and he's meeting me there for dinner with Chas. And Chas and I are going to have hopefully romantic weekend to take my mind off of everything. I'm not sure how romantic it will be when I'm falling all over the place from city walk crawl. But it will still be fun. So it's official Chas is staying in Largo. I'm not going to fight it, it's what is best for him. I'll deal, it's not that far. And the longest we go is about two weeks. Why am I complaining, I'm lucky to be with him, he makes me smile, he makes me laugh, and most of all he knows me, he knows when I'm being stupid and yet he humors me. I really lucked out with this one. This weekend should bring some good stories, hopefully no fighting (oh my part).

This was my response: I would be a blender. Blenders have a blade that spins and I like to twirl around (i.e. dance and jump around), Blenders are also loud and I hate uncomfortable silences. Blenders are usually used for a social gathering and I always love being around others. Also peppermint milkshakes are made in blenders, and peppermint milkshakes are one of my favorite treats.  Kinda good right?"

"event","I was working today, I work at a bookstore, it's a fun and easy job. I am very laid back and I guess I'm too trusting. So I left my clutch on the counter and two ghetto black girls come into the store and sell back their books and decide that they like my Louis Vuton, and then walk out of the store with it. So when it comes to leave I can't fine my purse with my phone, credit cards, pay check, and keys to my car, apartment and house. So I try calling my cell, it goes through several times then it starts going strait to my voice mail. I immediately cancel my debit card and go into panic mode, I call my dad which didn't help because he just screamed at me. We tow my car to the dealership so those bitches don't try to steal my car tonight. I'm mad, but more I feel crushed. I know I've said several choice words after the fact, but what did I ever do them? I would never steal someone's purse, wallet or money. I'm just disappointed in people, and I feel really stressed out because there is so much I have to do to try to make this right and the amount of money it's going to cost. And I feel terrible for my ignorance, I shouldn't of left it out in plain sight. I hope they enjoy my purse, it was a present to me, and I loved it because of that, one of my mom's friends who always thinks of others before her gave it to me, and some selfish person stole it. I think that's about it for now, hopefully next time will be something good to write about."

I know Kristen is my only reader, so it's like writing her notes so I should start out ""Dear Kristen""....

Dear Kristen,
I miss you, and I miss Chas. I gave him my profile name so he could read it, but I doubt he will. I wish he would so he would know how much I like him because sometimes I think he doesn't know. Anyways this summer's been hard because you're not around, 10 days I think for t-move in time. So Kristen do you ever feel that no matter what you say you're wrong, I mean you can't help the situation or how you feel, but it's not good enough. Well that's how I feel right now. I feel that Chas feels unappreciated because I didn't like him right off the bat, but what does that matter because all I think about is him, he is the one who I only want to be with, and I make myself tear up thinking that he's not happy. Sometimes I think I'm not good enough for him, I feel I keep on messing up. Well I don't know what else to say, I haven't written in a while and I don't really have any fun stories. OK bye Kristen :)"

But when I got back to Jacksonville I didn't want the shoes and I neglected them. Time after time I had a chances to wear them but I chose different shoes. Now I lost them, and I really wish I didn't. I had the chance to wear them but I didn't. Is it only when I don't have them do I want them? I get so happy just thinking about them. Well I think it's pretty obvious that I'm not talking about shoes and I'm talking about a boy, but I don't know what to do."

Umm lets see I think all five senses were acting against the concert. 1. smell: I smelled from the sweat dripping down my body. 2. taste: I was so thirsty and dieing from dehydration. 3. sight: it wasn't a bad sight but it was hard to see the band because I'm too short and I was too afraid to stand next to the stage by the mosh pit. 4. hearing: loud noises. 5. touch: don't get me started first off being pushed into not my fav. plus the fact of me sweating. Oh well all and all I had a good time, I was in good company. No regrets. We went to the library afterwards and I had a very needed and ""blessed"" talk with Chelsi, I think it's going to help me get through this week of finals. Everyone goood luck and study hard. Smiles."

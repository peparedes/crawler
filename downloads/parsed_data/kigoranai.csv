"event","well. i'm back... not that anyone will ever read this... oh well...  don't have too much to say... got an apartment... got a cable modem...  got a girlfriend... so you would think i would be happy but i'm not...  i still think about mishele alot... but not so much in a good way... me and her rarly talk... and i don't really care.... it's sad how much she lies to me and thinks i don't know... it's also sad that i realize shes only being nice to me cause she wants to use me for college... it makes me sick to know that... it's strange... there is a fine line between love and hate and lately i've been crossing that line more then the lane lines on the freeway when a drunk is driving... more and more i get the urge to tell her to fuck off and never talk to her again... and i know i don't really want that.. cause i do still love her.. but she won't be serious with me and i'm sick of waiting... and honestly... jenifer is so much better to me then mishele is... she's never bitchy or anything like that... maybe it's cause she thinks she is gonna lose me to mishele... it's funny just how unlikly that is... i wish my life would finnish cleaing up... its like things are almost in focus... but not... it's like willy isn't sure about a job and i'm in no rush to see mishele.... so i don't really have any reason to go to austin any more... and so many things are starting up for me here... when willy gets my computer built i will have a DVD burner and then i will push to open up a DVD department at RIDGEWAYS which i will get to run... hell.. i would be management... that would kick ass... plenty of money.. working days... weekend off... ::sigh:: i'm sure i can pull it off too... NO i WILL pull it off... FUCK MISHELE and her indiference.. it's time for me to live my life and enjoy it...  HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!  I""M A WICKED CLOWN... AND THIS JUGGALO IS KICKIN ALL THE SHITTY HOES TO THE FLOOR.     MOON GLORIOUS"

"event","well.. i guess i'll try to be more constant in my posts. lets see... i beat kingdom hearts today... the ending was pretty good... but kinda inronic, when i look at my last post.  during the ending cloud found aerith.... maybe i should take that as a sign... LOL... maybe not. who knows...  it's funny... in this world you are welcome to go get happyness in any shape you want... as long as it doesn't make someone else unhappy...  like mishele keeps saying that i should do what makes me happy and stop worrying about things... well.. maybe what would make me happy would be to tell everyone she knows about how me and her are more or less a couple... i guess that would somewhat make me happy... but some how i don't think she would back me up on that... LOL...  she doesn't understand why the deception bothers me so much... i think it's cause if she has no problem ""deciving"" her friends why should i believe she isn't deciving me... because i'm more special? BULLSHIT...  she says i should have faith... well it's hard to have faith in someone who wants to keep you a deep dark secret... why hide me so? simple... too many other men... where would she draw her energy if they thought they couldn't have her... ::shurgs:: oh well i guess..  hmm.. i should type here more often... i feel tons better... and i guess i'll crank up kingdom hearts and take on the optional boss battle again... THE GOD OF DEATH HIMSELF (and i don't mean hades... he was easy) SEPHIROTH.  they even have his original boss music ""one winged angel""  so... off i go.... keyblade in hand... god thats lame..."

"event","well... i guess i'm overdue for an update... what else is new right?  things here are as hectic as ever...  i'm being pulled in 50 directions at once... and i hate it.... i'm getting to the point where i'm just going to tell EVERYONE to fuck off and leave me alone... between my grandfather calling me every other day to do some stupid computer bullshit... my dad reminding me i need to GET OUT of his house and trying to get doug to come look at an apartment with me... (i've given up on that... i'll just get my own place) i have to deal with a recent influx of girls wanting to date me.. and it's really not in my nature to be rude... cause i know how being shot down can hurt... but i don't want to deal with it...  though it is cool that alot of chicks that are hitting on me are anime chicks... they see my kenshin shirt or what ever anime shirt i'm wearing and want to strike up a conversation.   which is cool i guess..  jen has been coming over alot... i got her all hooked on escaflowne so when ever she gets a chance we watch it.  which is cool.... she's been a good friend.. i can talk to her about alot of stuff i can't talk to others about.  cause she's a girl... it's easier to talk to some girls. actually she alot like alicia... so in many ways i feel more comfortable around her. but in other ways that makes me uncomfortable.  ::sigh:: and mishele... i still love her.. but more and more i feel like we would butt heads too much to ever be a couple... to be honest... if she really loves me like she says then how can she be so thoughtless twards me.  the other day she was suposed to call.. she said she would so instead of going to bed before work i stayed up and waited... cause ""she hates when people say they will do something and then don't... so i know she won't do that to me"" but alas.. when i draged my tired ass to work there was still no call... and you know... i'm sure she's having sex and what not.. and yeah.. that bugs me.. but... i can't be mad.. cause we are just friends... and honestly... maybe she isn't having sex.. but i don't trust her.. i don't trust anyone... i've been cutting off all my emotions lately... all this stress is killing me... and bringing out the worst in them... but i hold some faith that when i get up there things will work out for a little while.  just gotta suffer through 6 monthes here...  i really don't know what to say... i'm so jealous of her male friends... which i'm sure she loves to hear.. but fuck her... i'm tired of playing games.. if i'm jealous them i'm jealous.. i'm not going to pretend i'm not... but i'm not going to bitch about it either.. what good will that do.. .i mean really...  it just sucks... i have never met someone who i clicked so weel with... someone who got all my jokes and i loving being around so much... honesly right now i feel like FF7.  I'm cloud... and all i want is my aerith but she's out of my reach... no matter where i go or how hard i try i can't grab her... sure.. maybe i should just take the tifa thats here now by my side and wants me... but... but she's not the one i want. i just don't know if i have what it takes to chase her forever... i'm not as strong as cloud.  ::sigh:: she just won't commit to me cause she's afraid of losing what we have... our friendship... but as much as i hate to say it... at this point if things get bad the only way i'll ever cope... is walk away and never look back...  and as much as i hate to say it... we may have gotten in a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation. i don't know.. i need to sleep... and then work... and then not think about her... cause these days that only seems to drag me down..."

"event","i'm back already... and again... i don't know what to say.... the only thing i know i need to say is that... as i sat down and forced myself to eat some cerial i didn't want i realized i have only eaten 3 times in the last 4 days... which is unhealthy normaly.. but much worse when you are working out had and boosting your metabolism... and i think i've been subconciously trying to commit suicide. i've been trying to make my body break down. crash.. and all this mess.  to mishele... i don't know if you actually read this or not... probably not.... but i hope you do... i want you to see this.. or know this.. but i don't think i can ever TELL you... i may try to get you to come read this later... i'm not sure... but a week ago when you turned on me... and more so after our last conversation... you said you still loved me but i felt like you were just saying that... i feel very unloved and unwanted... and the way i don't really think you would bat an eye if you never spoke to me again hurts.. during this time i needed someone so badly to lean on and i needed to feel loved so that i could help myself... and you were all i had.. and now i feel like i don't have you.  i feel like i have nothing.... i really can't find a reason to want to live... i'm going to force myself to eat... cause i know later i'll be happy i didn't die... and as much as i want you to know this... i feel that if i told you you would think i was trying to be dramatic and make you feel guilty and thats not the case... i just want your help... i just want to feel like i'm not alone... oh no... tears... real tears... i'm crying... it's probably the first time in monthes that i'm really crying... and the fact that it's happening while i type this scares me... cause it means of all the things i have said in this damn journal... this must hit closest to home... other wise i would do this emotionless like i normaly do.  ::sigh:: i hope that you read this.. and somewhere in your heart you care enough about me to want to help me.... cause i swear i'm going to try to eat.. and not let my self keep sinking in this depression.. cause.. deep down i do love you... very much... but i feel nausious even now.. and if i get to the point where i can't force myself to keep food down i don't know what i'll going to do.. maybe some time in a ""clinic"" would do me some good... i need to escape from everything and find myself.. find something inside me to make me want to live... cause it's not fair to you to put all of this on you... you don't desirve this stress... and i don't either... cause i'm not i bad person... now if only i could make myself believe that... now to sleep. and then i'll get up and put on this fake mask that i'm fine and i've never felt better and i'm so glad i'm ""getting in shape""  and unless you read this you probably won't even know either... cause i wear that mask around you too now... because as much as i love you... because you attacked me emotionaly... deep down i don't trust you... and i won't let you see my weakness... i'll be false strong untill i've either solved my problems alone... or let myself die... and at this point it really seems like it could go either way..."

"event","wow... i opened this up with a million things in my mind.. and now that i'm typing... none of them are coming out... i feel bad... do i feel bad because of the conversation that i had with mishele? yes and no... do i feel bad because the thought of walking away from mishele and never talking to her again bothers and sadens me? no... and thats why i feel bad... because walking away forever doesn't even matter to me.. and it should... but it just doesn't... and what sickens me even more is the apathy i feel inside FEELS the same as the apathy i saw in alicia's eyes when we split up.  when i ask my self the question what will come of us i only get the same answer ali told me... ""i just don't know.. and i don't really care""   it's strange... it almost feels like ali and mishele are working together... because i'm in the exact oposite side that i was when last i split up. it's almost like mishele told alicia ""don't worry.. when i'm done he will understand how you felt""  because i do... pain untill a point when i just cut it all off and don't care... thats so sad..  i just hope i don't stay this way... someday i'll fall in love and get married... or i want to atleast.. then again... i've been pushing myself so hard lately... (in an effort to not deal with my problems)  that my body may just give out on me and i drop dead on the spot.. ::chuckles:: atleast i'll look good at my funeral.  LOL"

LOL... but thats good... sore muscles are muscles that have been worked good... i plan on keeping them sore for the next month straight atleast.  there has only been a small change in psyical apearence so far... but all the self esteem and enegy i have gained are overwhelming. hmm... what else to say... OH YEAH.. mishele was acting really strange tonight... all lovey dovey and acting like she missed me... i think it's cause i've started talking to other girls and it is making her nervious.. and you know what.. she DAMN WELL better be NERVIOUS.  in the last 2 days i have had 3 girls hit on me and they were all pretty damn attractive.  and after the way she has been treating me lately i was (and still am) this close to walking away... i mean... shit... i love her.. but i don't desirve that kind of abuse... is she thinks she can play games with me she will soon find out that she's playing solitare as i walk the fuck away.  ::cracks a smile:: i feel so self reliant these last few days... i feel like i can do anything... and i will do anything... in about a week i hope to have a 24 hour fittness membership.. then i'm gonna work extra hard to get in shape... i will have abs of steel.. LOL.. well maybe not steel.. but i'll have a flat tummy and big arms... i found a crappy little weight in my closet that weighs about 7 pounds...  (6.6 actually)   while it's not much i have been doing a hundred reps with it every day... and 100 reps even with that little weight is going to help me tone up alot... i can build mass later... if i can get tone i'll be happy.... well.. it's time for some more crunches and then in about 3 hours it's time to do my joging...  when work pics back up it's going to be a bitch to keep this up... but i'm focused...  i'm VERY focused... and i will do it.

"event","ugh... i'm overdue for an update... i got some thermogenics to up your metabolism and just in a day and half i've already lost like 5 pounds...  course i'm working out really hard. today i drove the rout i usualy  walk/jog  to see how long it was... turns out it's roughly 3 and a half miles round trip.  thats pretty good... i just gotta keep at it so i can get my abs of steel.  plus joging in the mornings you meet alot of neat people.  most older people who are full of good advice and some pretty cute chicks that are in REALLY good shape... LOL... i should really start joging on the asian side of houston... meet some hot asian chicks with hard tummys that i can eat sushi off of... LOL... like that would ever happen.. but all sillyness aside i seem to be able to talk to mishele alot easier now. since i started working out and getting in shape i do have alot more energy and feel lots better about myself... and it seems the better you feel about yourself the less the opinions of others seem to bother you.  i mean.. i know mishele is still going to flirt and go out with guys but hey... thats no biggie i guess... i can't really go beat them up or anything silly like that so why stress about it.  i can put that energy to better uses. like the crunches i'm about to do now... or the chicks i won't be able to keep off of me.. LOL... oh well... hmm.. anything else interesting... oh.. 1 i found a place on my rounds that i jog that teaches hopkido. sounds interesting to me. and also i may have found a room mate to move in with... Doug from work.  he's a really cool guy and is also trying to get in shape so when we move in together i'm going to move away from joging and more twards lifting weights with him... i plan in about 2 or 3 weeks to have burned most of the fat i want to burn.. the rest will burn off while i'm lifting... the only other thing i need right now is some barbells for doing curls... BUILD UP THOSE ARMS.  then i'll be ready to be magus at akon next year... even if it is a year away..."

LOL... sigh... you know... about half the reason i got this journal was to tell her things with out telling her things... and i bet she never even reads it... go fig... oh well.. you know...i told myself that i wasn't moving to austin for her... but now that i feel unwanted... i just can't get excited about it.  ::sigh:: i wish i could go cry... and scares me when i feel this sad inside and can't cry... it's not healthy. ::sigh:: oh well... i sad post... this to shall pass"

I guess I don't really have a lot to update.  about to play D&D that should be fun. I'm a  1st lever fighter  5 level necromancer  3 level pale master  named janus rinraku. i tried to model him around magus from chrono trigger.  He has a very low charisma but thats ok... i'm really ejoying running a surley character.  plus now that he is about to gain access to 5th level spells he's fast becoming the most usefull member ot the party... anyway... can't think of anythign else to say at the moment other then i feel alot better about everything.  i had a conversation with alicia. probably the most normal conversation i have had with her in almost a year.  i guess i forgive her for everything. i said i would after i felt she had suffered enough and after what she went through i think she has. As for mishele i don't know... i don't want to say i'm becoming ok with everything but i think i'm coming to terms with it. i can feel myself putting out the passionate love i feel for her so that i can deal with this.  i just hope that i can bring it back later when we are ready for it.  but if the past is any example then thats not very likely. but i guess i'll just have to play it by ear. there are plenty of women out there and with a little confadence i can have them all."

I needed a good laugh.... my days have really sucked lately...  my review kind of sucked...  I got a raise even though it was only a small one... I got $  .50  due to my ""insubordination"" I should be happy I wasn't fired... and I think Daryl was being pretty fair... he said my attitude had gotten better and if I keep it up then I'll get another $ .50  in 30 to 60 days...  which is also very fair of him.  even though I acted pretty shitty about a month ago he didn't really hold a grudge.  I guess he regained some of the respect I had lost for him, and that my friends is a hard thing to do.  I'm all pull of pep and energy and wanna do something else... maybe I'll see if carly wants to come watch lain. she seems all digging on the series.  I just wish I hadn't loaned out my trigun DVD's I really feel like watching them now.  oh well.. no biggie..  maybe I'll watch gundam wing.  I have the whole series on DVD and never even watched it.  hmm.. I guess that sounds good.  maybe things are finally on  the up and up  ""thumbs up soldier"""

I'm getting a raise for sure.. the question is how much. ::shrugs:: does it really matter.. it's just money... i should be happy... but i'm not... i really don't know what to do about mishele. she hasn't done anything wrong.

(look at me... ever trying to be the martyr) i just don't know... and i know one reason we would always but heads... because she much like alicia has to have attention from multiple people... she thrives on it and that always drove me crazy... ::sigh:: i'm rambling. anyway.. it's literally a case of i can't live with her and i can't live without her. i guess i'm just greedy... i love her so much i want to keep her all to myself. ::sigh:: oh well... no matter what happens i'll be ok. even if i have to be ok alone."

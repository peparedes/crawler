"event","It is Christmas Eve.  I guess I'll forget that I said that last thing, because it turns out maybe she wasn't spreading rumors about me, and it was the spammers instead?  I wonder if they told her I was spreading rumors about her...but then, it happened twice.  I am so fucking confused.  But anyway, things are getting slightly better.  I've gotten a lot of my writing done, and I plan to work on it more and more.  I have WORD now, so it should be fine.  I need to work on so many fanfics it's scary.  But I'll live, and hopefully enjoy it.  Well, anyway.  It is Christmas Eve night, soon to be Christmas morning, and all that stuff.  I was never a fan of Christmas anyway.  I didn't do shopping or anything.  Hopefully I can resize the Morgan Xmas card and post it on VGF tommorow."

"event","Fuck the world.  No, really.  Fuck the world.  I'm seriously pissed off at EVERYONE lately.  I've been irritable as all bloody hell.  My family can go to hell.  I guess my friends are the only things I have left in the world, and even those are practically nonexisant.  And I think Kaz is still spreading rumors about me being gay.  Fuck her, too.

"event","I have to finish my story by the end of the year, mom says.  The problem is that I keep getting ideas for different stories.  I lose interest for Tears of a Broken Soul and want to work on something else.  My cousin says I've been working on the same story for too long.  -_- But I have to finish TBS by January.  It's such a long story, I don't know what I'm going to do.

I need a vacation, badly.

I have this idea for a story about a girl named Jayde who gets lost and ends up in a another world, meets some guy named Amadeus and blah de blah (musn't forget)"

"event","I'm feeling more and more like Arcus everyday.  I've been not knowing what to do with anything, thinking extremely strange paranoid thoughts, thing that can never happen but I still think about them and sometimes think that they CAN and WILL happen.  My most recent vision was about falling into a wood chopper.  I don't know how long this will last.  Hopefully not too much longer.  (I also think my little brother is going to kill me)."

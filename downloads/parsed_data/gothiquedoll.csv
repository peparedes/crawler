She's got internet so this means Im back online. Not that I really ever get time to post but I will try to be a bit more internet friendly this year. Im looking for a new job. Im dancing again so maybe Scarlets, or someplace nice but I dont want to have to take out my jewelry. This city sucks you dry and spits you out. I should have moved when I had the chance too. Now Im stuck here i can only hope that things get better."

"event","Had a phone conversation with Akhmed the other day, in which I asked him this, a question for the Ages:

""Who, among all of Hitler's senior commanders and general staff, would taste the best if you were a cannibal?""

Now, I think this is a query that demands some analysis and thought. Hitler (while being an obvious choice) would be rather stringy, perhaps in a stew at best. Hess also looked too thin, and I'd worry about consuming someone with such obvious mental issues. Goering was quite fat (and thus juicy), but one wonders what his drug addictions would do to the meat.  Von Ribbentrop, I think, was old and leathery. Goebbels, the sniveling little imp that he was - probably didn't pack too much on him.

I think my pick would go to Karl Doenitz - military man, decent build, so I think he'd pack some flavorful meat on him. Plus all that sea air (he <b>was</b> Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine I believe) may impart a savory pre-salted flavor. For that mesquite smokey-bbq taste, perhaps Rommel, as a good second choice (with just a <i>hint</i> of Panzer IV diesel oil for fragrance."

"event","I apologize for the long absence. Been both busy, and lazy when I wasn't busy.

As for my mid-Jul 'vacation' - it was a blast!

First the wedding. In the span of one week I got drunk, into a car accident (no relation to the former), and into a tux (for the first time...ever). I was following my old W&M buddy Skittles to the Patrick Henry Mall to pick up our marital-ceremony uniforms, when the pickup truck ahead of Skittles slams on his brakes for no reason (it was 64 - natch). Mike slams his brakes, missing the truck by a few inches. I was following Mike - and wasn't so lucky. End result: not a scratch on Mike's car, and a crunched in front grill/panel on the Honda. Mike did say it was funny seeing me throw a raging fit through his rear-view mirror.

As it turned out - the damage was purely cosmetic - but first the actual <i>wedding</i> part of the wedding. The night before, we threw Seanie (the groom) a bachelor party. By 'party' I mean all of us W&M Skiffy-ites there for the event drank a lot and watched movies and porn, while the groom himself spent less then 20 min <b>at his own party</b>. This was not as big a deal as it seemed, since it then obligated us to drink <i>for</i> him - which we did gladly.

The wedding was at the Wren Chapel - which really does make for a great location - by the time the ceremony was about to start - my hangover had been defeated. Now, let me add two fun things about Williamsburg weddings:

1.)Tuxes SUCK when it's upper 90's in both temperature <b>and</b> humidity.
2.)Williamsburg is fun in the summer because it can go from sauna to <i>Mumbai-level torrential downpour</i> in an hour. The amusing thing here was that it rained thus only for the duration of the wedding itself...

The reception - two words: <b>FUCKING A!</b> Skiffy class of '01 kicked it like a rockstar narcotics addition - REPEATEDLY :) Though it was a dry reception, that didn't stop all the old gang from <i>thoroughly</i>  freaking out the normals among the bride & groom's family. Who would've thought one could have that much fun sober?

After the wedding and reception, I along with Skittles stayed in town a few more days, pretty much to drink, play video games, and watch cartoons. Though there was the obligatory 'Burg rites-of-return: Mongolian Wok, Sno-to-Go (Hey! You got your sno-cone in my religious fundamentalist church! No, you got your fundamentalist church in my sno-cone! Now with Sno-to-Go you can have BOTH!), as well as the Leaf/Delis.

After leaving the 'Burg, I stayed at my parent's place in Delaware. Slept in. Went to the beach (w00t!), and ate what may in fact be the most delicious sandwich ever. Behold, <a href=""http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2005/sandwich/bobbie.html"">'The Bobbie'</a>. Nuke this guy for ~20s or so - I would marry this sandwich if it were a woman (or barring that, lived in Massachusetts). If ever you must travel through either Delaware (or Nevada) grab one of these at Capriotti's Deli. AFAIK there are about 10 of 'em in DE alone.

It was here in 'The Diamond state' (which I find puzzling, unless state founding fathers confused ""diamonds"" with ""chicken farms""), that I found out that the accident caused no real damage to the workings of my car, but was driving a corroding, failing, rusting deathtrap-on-wheels. As Skittles so delicately put it ""So my car pretty much did the equivalent of breaking the nose of a terminal syphilitic person..."" Thus began my (currently ongoing) ""Quest to Find a Cheap, Low-Mileage, Reliable, Asian-made Car"".

Took one weekend to hang with Skittles in his new digs in Falls Church, VA. We pretty much did the same thing we did in the 'Burg: slept in, watched movies and cartoons, and drank (note to self: do NOT argue with a rabid Libertarian while drunk. The fact that this fellow did, in fact, own a Glock made my move, while amusing, less than wise). On the Saturday, we went into DC to watch ""Howl's Moving Castle"" at a theater in Dupont Circle. The metro was a nice as I remember it, while the Miyazaki was not. Now, don't get me wrong, the man is a master of detailed animation, and his design work gives a Steampunk fan like me a nerd-stiffy, but compared to the other works I've seen, Howl lacked good pacing (waaaaaaay too slow), had a plot quite convoluted, even by Miyazaki standards, and an unfortunate <i>Deus ex machina</i> ending. So, like a big predatory cat - very beautiful and graceful to look at, but don't spend too much time near it unless you have a LOT of fish on you (calliing Jesus Cat-girl ahkmed?)."

"event","I was in a hurry to eat dinner, as I need to get back to my Faustian amphibian alchemy and what not, so I decided to eat at a Korean place within walking distance of my lab. I ordered one of my usual dishes - <i>Sul-Rung-Tang</i>. Recently, they have been adding an additional ingredient to the normal savory broth, fatty beef, rice noodles, and green onions - <i>tripe</i>. Now, although I'm non-plussed about it - I have still ordered and eating the dish - tripe or no. I can 'deal', with regards to tripe, but like Marmite - it's not exactly <b>bad</b>, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.

I just have a 'thing' about eating digestive system (tongue, tripe, chitlin's, etc.) I don't like the knowledge that what I'm chewing has been in extended contact with mixtures of feed and digestive enzymes. Even more disconcerting to me is the texture - all the little 'knobby' things on the trip - as someone far wittier than I no doubt expressed upon being served a similar dish made from similar organs - when I'm tasting my food, I'd rather rather do without the sensation that it's <b>tasting me back.</b>

On another note, a friend of mind has made me privy to a secret - somewhere on campus there are several groups of parking meters that charge a quarter for 30 minutes, as opposed to the nominal 20. I'd like to think that I've joined the ranks of some arcane society, armed with obscure and deep secrets that only we are to know - it's not exactly knowing the secrets of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priory_of_Zion"">Priory of Zion</a>, or the machinations and influence of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_Commission"">Trilateral Commission</a>, but for a humble graduate student surrounded by corn and soy, perhaps it's enough."

I have now determined <i>precisely</i> an important, nay, <b>essential</b> quantity: the amount of shrimp cocktail that is required to completely satisfy me.

The result is: 1.5 lbs.

Ah shrimp - ""It's the Ocean's <i>candy!*</i>""

*WARNING - Jews should not take internally.

The following link is, I believe, the closest I have come to personally observing a Lovecraftian horror: <a href=""http://angelswithattitude.faithweb.com/photo.html"">Behold!</a> Guard thy soul with the utmost fortitude - for a journey thus places thy very sapient essence at peril!

Seriously, seeing an <i>army</i>  of soul-less toddler-pods, lumbering towards me would be a nightmare of the first order! They are like pod-creatures sent to Earth in an attempt to lull us into befriending them, before the juveniles molt, discarding their snappy clothes and toddler-mascara and pupate into some horrible adult <i>phagous</i> stage. Only the aliens mis-calculated, causing us - their erstwhile prey - to flee in horror <i>away</i> from the terror-tots rather than embracing them, only to breath collective sighs of relief once the childlike visages are shed for something less chilling - a nice, segmented exoskeleton perhaps?

Finally, I had a very odd dream last night. I was living with my parents in some giant mansion. It was late at night, and I was a scientist, testing small-yield tactical nukes in a room in the mansion. They were contained in small steel boxes, and I would set on up, then move about 40 feet away and fire a rifle into the bomb casing - causing an oddly localized detonation. Yet something went wrong (as if the fact that a 5kt charge <b>not</b> vaporising me and the house was perfectly expected), and I somehow knew that I had been exposed to too much radiation. My parents were out for the night, and I figured that they would be quite displeased had they known that I had been testing nuclear weapons in the house. I also know that they'd be disappointed that I had perhaps caught one too many gamma rays, so I decided not to tell them, but I was worried that I'd start losing my hair.

Like most of my dreams - I prefer not to think there is any inherent <i>meaning</i> in that, particularly because if there were, I think someone would be sending me to a nice, happy place, with fun padded walls - and  where Fridays are <i>Jello</i> night! *starts rocking back and forth*"

For those not in the know, I've spent the majority of the past 2 months preparing for, and performing, field and behavioral work on my treefrogs at the University of Missouri - Columbia, as they have a particularly <i>large</i> concentration of treefrogs, and frog behavioral researchers (a whopping 3!) This is actually quite large if you consider that for most studied animals which are <b>not</b> 'model' systems - i.e. not mice rats, monkeys, fruit flies, etc., you could fit all the scientists that study said animal in a small conference room.

Overall, I got some useful data - but being a novice to field-work, many mistakes were made, and the majority of my behavioral experiments were only preliminary. It was pretty stressful, as the prof at Mizzou that I was working with is a very tense, impatient person, who seemed to snap at me every time I asked a question! An example (the name is not real - check it in a German dictionary):

<b>Me:</b> Ah, my universe is all in order, but I have one tiny question - I know, I shall ask Dr. Namenlos!

<b>Me (to Dr. Namenloss):</b> Herr Doktor! I have a small, quick question <proceeds to ask question>

<b>Dr. Namenlos:</b> Pfft! You are all wrong! I shall now proceed to upset your whole line of thinking!

<b>Me:</b> Zounds man!  I need to re-think things....

<b>Dr. Namenlos:</b> Arg! Why can't you keep up with me, you are such a bother! <shakes fist at me>

Okay - that's not <i>really</i> how it went down, but you get the picture. The funny thing is - 10 min after snapping and/or patronizing me, he'll act friendly and tell a joke. At one point he began to re-arrange and neaten the electronics and cables on the desk I was working at, and the following (semi-paraphrased) exchange took place:

<b>Him:</b> I'm sorry, but I'm kind of obsessive-compulsive about these things..
<b>Me:</b> Well, you're German, that's sort of a national trait.
<b>Him:</b> Not really. Our national trait is killing lots of French people...

Both tasteless <i>and</i> offensive - he definitely went up a few points in my book for that joke!

To sum up my Missouri experience:
<ul>
<li> It was nice to be in a state that actually has forests, trees, and really cool fauna. I saw beautiful damselflies, tiger beetles, crayfish, box turtles, several kinds of frogs and even a small faun in a sleeping depression at night,</li>
<li>Missouri drivers are <i>horrible</i>, and coming from someone brought up in <b>New Jersey</b>, that's sayin' something! Hint: There <b>is</b> a function for that <i>blinker</i> lever on your steering column MO-drivers - USE IT!</li>
<li>I thought it got hot & muggy in central IL - well central MO takes it up a notch...</li>
<li>Weird people do research. Clinically <i>insane</i> people do <u>field</u> research.</li>
</ul>

And finally, 
<b>Three things that happened in Missouri that I could <i>never</i> have forseen occurring to me:</b>
<ol>
<li>I'm in the field, and I feel a tickle/itch on my thigh. The fact that central MO seems to be the Deer tick capital of the midwest makes me think that a little arachnid had somehow gotten into my boot-tucked jeans leg, and was making it's way to my nether-regions. As that is a <b>bad</b> thing, I decided to nip it in the bud. As I was in the middle of the woods, alone, I quickly unzipped my jeans and decided to remove the little bastard. Only it wasn't a tick. It was a <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?biw=&q=Wood+cockroach&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images"">wood cockroach</a>. In my <b>pants</b>. Rarely before in my life has such a scream eminated from my mouth.</li>
<li>I stayed in the house of some graduate students - all of which are major/minor herpetology fans. Among the myriad lizards and snakes they had a <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&biw=1022&q=Savannah+monitor&btnG=Search"">Savannah monitor</a> named Lucifer. Until last month I have <i>never</i> smelled a lizard fart. This has now changed. Lizard urine may be very non-toxic and odorless, but their gas sure isn't!</li>
<li>I have now rectally probed frogs. Or, more properly, <i>cloacally</i> probed frogs. With a thermometer apparently <i>designed</i> for such a use in amphibians, reptiles and birds. So <i>that's</i> how all those <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&biw=1022&q=grey+alien&btnG=Search"">greys</a> must feel. In the span of 5 min, I go from biologist to <a href=""http://www.kithfan.org/work/transcripts/four/analprob.html""><i>Kids in the Hall</i></a> sketch. </li>
</ol>

<i>Whew!</i>

In today's news, apparently researchers in Pittsburgh working on hypothermic therapies for massive injury treatment have created, in the fantastic words of Aussie 'journalists', <a href=""http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15739502-13762,00.html"">'Zombie dogs'</a> (great pic, btw). I'm eagerly awaiting confirmation from more, shall we say, <i>reputable</i> journalistic sources of science research news (what you say?, an Australian website and <a href=""http://www.slashdot.org"">Slashdot</a> are not considered reputable sources, egads!). If true - find the research very cool (har har), but don't necessarily see the easy transition from canine to human application. The name of the game here is preventing brain damage by slowing cellular metabolism and protein degradation to a crawl for as long as possible, until the victim can get better care. The human brain has a significantly larger requirement of overall blood volume than the canine, and I suspect that the vascular network is also appropriately more complex. This may reduce the effectiveness of such therapies, but it's still neat. 

Of course I expect to read a headline next week that actor Fred Gynne is running amok at the labs, smashing and burning all equipment, pumping load after load of buckshot into the research animals, yelling in an overstated Maine accent ""Dead is bettah! Dead is bettah!"". Of course, the ultimate irony of such a situation is that Mr. Gywnne is, in fact, dead himself."

Headed out yesterday to St. Louis to see <a href=""http://www.muse.mu"">Muse</a> in concert at <a href=""http://www.thepageant.com"">The Pageant</a> in the 'Loop'. Met up with my old pal Kevin, had dinner with him and his friend Deepani at a Middle Eastern deli. Had great Kufta. 

The opening band, another UK band - Razorlight, was unimpressive. After they played for what seemed an interminable 45 min, there was another 45 min set-up break, then Muse played - and they PLAYED F*CKING HARD AND LOUD AS HELL! It was most awesome :) My position was in the central 'pit' of the club, on the outskirts of the 'mosh zone'. This meant that while I was not moshing (really not my thing), I was only 4-5 people 'layers' behind those that did - which meant every so often there was a general 'crowd compression front' (CCF) in my direction - not much else I could do but hold the people in front of me back - seeing as I was backed up against the railing that formed the rear perimeter of the main 'pit'. 

Muse played pretty much all of the 'hard' tracks on it's latest album <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001LJC2K/qid=1114657002/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-1329687-1931840""><i>Absolution</i></a>, and several songs (including 'Citizen Erased' w00t!) from their previous album, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005KFUM/qid=1114657002/sr=2-4/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_4/103-1329687-1931840""><i>Origin of Symmetry</i></a>. Unfortunately they did not play ""Muscle Museum from their debut album, which would have pissed my friend Mike off much - as he <b>loves</b> that song, which they have yet to play each time he has seen them in concert.

I spent the night at Kevin's apt, then headed back to Champaign early the next morning. Got fitted for a tux for my friend Seanie's wedding at a mall in Springfield. I arrived at the mall (on the way back from St. Louis) at 8:30, but had to wait 1.5 hours for the store to open. The rest of the day is more or less pretty normal, except for the fact I'm tired as hell.

"event","Can't believe it's only been 4 days since I left for Missouri - feels like much longer, but then again, the Midwest <i>is</i> a vortex where time, space, fashion, and topography have no meaning!

So, I spent an evening with my good friend Kevin, now living in the South City- SoGrand section of St. Louis. He lives in a spiffy area - near a nice strip of coffee shops, ethnic restaurants, and clubs. After that, I spent the next few days with the fellas at the <a href=""http://www.mizzou.edu/"">University of Missouri - Columbia</a>.  Columbia seems like a pretty cool town - like Champaign-Urbana, but with more natural scenery - and the campus is <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=university%20of%20missouri%20columbia&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=wi"">quite</a> <a href=""http://ua.missouri.edu/tour/"">nice</a> - somewhat architecturally and aesthetically more pleasing than <a href=""http://www.uiuc.edu/ricker/CampusTour?target=goToStop&code=Mquad#"">my own</a>, IMHO. Dr. Schul was a very good host, and I got a lot of information to use in planning my upcoming field work. 

I got to explore the ponds used for frog collection and field experimentation at the <a href=""http://www.snr.missouri.edu/baskett/"">Thomas Baskett Wildlife area</a> - you can make out of few of the ponds in the center-right parts of the main picture. I found out that while this area has a <i>huge</i> concentration of <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=Gray+treefrog&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images"">Gray treefrogs, </a> it is also seemingly the <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&q=Deer+tick&btnG=Search"">Deer tick</a> capital of the Midwest. Even after a supposedly thorough check of myself and my jeans for ticks, I apparently missed one of the 'lil buggers who decided to have a taste of my left thigh. Now the parasitic bastard has gone to tick-heaven and sits in a small vial, and I need to call the health center people to see if I need to get it check for any diseases. Because getting Lyme disease is <i>exactly</i> what I need to worry about right now..

I drove back from Columbia yesterday morning, took just about 4.5 hours, and I ended up <i>not</i> back home at my apartment, but at the bi-annual <a href=""http://www.champaign.org/"">Champaign Public library</a> Book Sale. I left an hour or so later, thirty dollars cheaper, and twenty-five books heavier. Yes, readers, I am <i>that</i> sad - I woke up at 5 AM to drive 310 miles in order to get to a book sale earlier. What can I say - book sales are like crack to me!

Last night also marked the first Neuroscience Student Organization Bar Crawl. I thought it went pretty well - even if we did hit the on-campus undergrad bars, had to wait on many lines as it was the UIUC Mom's Day weekend (read: <i>very</i> crowded campustown), and couldn't get into one of our scheduled destinations as it was 50 people overcapacity. Saw some military-school folks from the UK and Ireland over here to play some rugby, and yes - there were two of 'em in drag. Who said that <i>Monty Python</i> and <i>Benny Hill</i> stereotypes weren't true - <b>something</b> deep down in the British sub-conscious <i>likes</i> to put dresses on! 

Although I had a good time in general, it was still apparent (at least to me) how uncomfortably I 'fit in' with most of my peers. I just don't 'click' with them, and I didn't drink enough to really loosen up - my tolerance having gone significantly down in the past few years, as much as the negative-effects of too much booze on myself have risen. So though I had some fun - the very 'social-ness' of the night demonstrated the actual isolation that I occupy within my graduate department - misunderstood (or perhaps too well understood) by others, ignored by many, and best friend to no-one.

A warning to all (except, of course, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/akhmed"">akhmed</a>), in watching <a href=""http://jeremyg2k.dyndns.org/revue/Discovery%20of%20Cooper.mov"">this video</a> you put your very <i>soul</i> in jeopardy! My feelings on the matter can be summed up by some of my comments about the film, made to its focal subject:

<b>CrispieWM:</b> Your song-dance thing should be used to frighten small children.
<b>CrispieWM:</b> Gods. like a train-wreck, I don't <i>want</i> to look, but <b>I can't take my eyes off it.</b>

and finally,

<b>CrispieWM:</b> That registers with me, like an Old-One does to a Lovecraftian-protagonist. If I dwell on it, it would sunder my mind to innumerable fragments, so I steal it away and lock it in the depths of my soul, never to see the light of day again, lest I be stricken with insanity, and death."

"event","Last weekend was busy. I took my camera out to Meadowbrook Park, and in particular, its <a href=""http://www.prairienet.org/meadowbrook/"">prairie restoration</a>. It was a gorgeous day, and I got a few decent shots - though the wildflowers have yet to really spring there - I <i>did</i> surprise a few pheasants while walking, which was nice. There were a lot of pheasants back home in NJ - but I lived near woods, as opposed to meadows, so I didn't see them often.

On Sunday, I drove about 150 miles around in loops and such about 40 or so miles south of here, scouting potential frog collection and field experimental sites. I was using GPS and map information on sites provided by a <a href=""http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/cbd/herpdist/species/hy_versi_c.html"">Illinois Natural History Survey group</a> mapping the <i>Hyla versicolor/chrysoscelis</i> complex in IL. It was a nice drive with <i>fantastic weather</i> - 80 degrees! I failed to find the first site in Douglas Co., as I found the location from the map description, but the GPS coords were off - and there was <b>nothing</b> nearby that suggested any kind of frog habitat. I was more successful with the second site, finding the rough, unpaved country road and bridge over the Embarass river, so I was <i>sure</i> that I had the spot - but again the GPS numbers were off by at least a mile or so. Also saw a llama at a local farm, and instantly thought, <a href=""http://www.soapboxblog.com/sounds/ND_Tina.wav"">""Tina, come get some HAM!""</a> Driving back, I picked up some shoes and belts at the outlet mall in Tuscola. Overall it was a good day - saw a LOT of the local countryside (had to pull over to let a few farmers pass on their tractors), got some spiffy shoes, and a nice sunburn on my left arm from hanging it out the window :)

In between that and today, I've been running another frog recording session, and again failing. This guy was a big bleeder though - which is bad news for getting cells in the first day, as bleeders' brains tend to swell up a lot - compacting the cell layers I'm trying to record from. So, I called it an early night at 11.

So tomorrow I must finish up my current frog experiment, and prep for my first trip to the University of Missouri. This involved packing clothes, experimental gear and such, and driving to St. Louis to crash with my best friend from HS, Kevin, who currently lives there. Then on Thursday morning, it's another 2 or so hours to Columbia. At Mizzou, I'm going to chat and plan out experiments for May, check out the behavioral arena they have, and scope out the frog collection sites close to the university. I'll be staying at the home of our most probable collaborator there, <a href=""http://www.biology.missouri.edu/action.lasso?-database=BioFaculty&-response=graduate%2fNB%2fNB_Faculty_Detail.html&-table=detail&-sortField=Fac_Last_Name&-sortOrder=ascending&-op=cn&discipline=neuro&-maxRecords=1&-skipRecords=8&-search"">Dr. Johannes Schul</a> - a very nice guy.

Saturday morning, bright and early, I'm planning on heading back here in one shot, getting here by noon-ish. I intend on checking out a local book sale (yes, I'm leaving at 6AM to drive 5-6 hours to get to a book sale - <i>I am such a dork!</i>). Later is the Neuroscience Program Bar Crawl, for which I already have the <i>official</i> shirt.

And now, yet another not-fully digested <i>bolus</i> of links:

The legacy of <a href=""http://hammer.prohosting.com/~sfspot/marvinglass.htm"">Marvin Glass</a> (thanks <a href=""http://www.metafilter.com"">MeFi</a>!) is huge - Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, Operation!, Moustrap, etc. The man is responsible for many of the cornerstones of a 60's-80's childhood. Don't forget the <a href=""http://www.secretfunspot.com/"">Secret Fun Spot!</a> Both links are chock full of retro-goodness, with great fonts and imagery that brought back a lot of old kitchy memories.

Ever wonder what the end of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/"">Se7en</a> would be like, if acted by stuffed animals? <a href=""http://gorillamask.net/seven.shtml"">Wonder no longer.</a>

I've barely scratched the surface of this site, <a href=""http://www.dself.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/museum.htm"">The Museum of RetroTechnology</a>, but my cursory delvings have provided much amusement - and if you are into Victorian Science fiction, Steampunk, Dieselpunk, etc, the site also a must.

By going <a href=""http://www.everyvideogame.com/gamelist.htm?order=rating"">here</a>, you risk significant loss of productivity - almost EVERY NES game made, emulate for your pleasure. SO COOL - even if it's all Java (which every TRUE programmer knows is the language of the <a href=""http://www.lsi.usp.br/usp/rod/magick/eliphas_levi_great_goat.gif"">Beast</a>), it's still hours of nostalgic, time-wasting joy!

Speaking of nostalgia - a LOT of childhood memories were dredged up by this page dedicated to important moments in <a href=""http://www.progressiveboink.com/archive/sesamestreet.html"">Sesame Street</a>. I remember almost all of these - those ""Yip-yip"" aliens used to <b>freak</b> me out as a kid. I always loved that Egyptian Bert & Ernie sketch (homosexual undertones aside, B&E were always my favorites - as I fortunately osmosed my Sesame Street culture in the <i>pre</i>-Elmo era), and for the past day, I've had that ""1 2 3 <b>4</b> 5, 6 7 8 <b>9</b> 10, 11 12!"" song in my head!

The ultimate weapon in <a href=""http://www.themoggy.com/solos.htm"">CUTENESS!</a> YOU <b>CANNOT</b> RESIST IT'S POWER - IT IS BEYOND YOU! BOW DOWN AND SURRDENER YOUR SELF TO YOUR <a href=""http://www.themoggy.com/olympics/daisy-kitten-in-hand.jpg"">FUZZY GOD.</a>

Finally, <a href=""http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2003/digdug/"">DIG DUG</a> - perhaps the greatest arcade game of all (or at least MY personal favorite!). I have very fond memories of playing the sit-down table version of this an an upstate-NY dude ranch on vacation years ago. EVERY nigh, I'd play several games - and eventually got into the Top Scores list. I think my love of the game stems from its inherently <b>sadistic</b> nature. I mean - you are jabbing bad-guys with a frickin' <i>air hose</i>, then inflating them until they <b>BURST!</b> That's pretty f***ed up, if you ask me! But for MY in-game foes, it was <i>never</i> that easy. Sure, I'd inflate them, get them ONE STEP away from popping, and then let them deflate a bit....until I pumped them up again, etc. I <i>teased, cajoled, taunted</i>, and <i>tormented</i> my digital foes until finally rendering unto them the sweet release of explosive death...

Man, I'm <i>messed</i> up! :)"

"event","Handed in the last of my qual questions today!! w00t^2. Now I just need to hear back from my committee, and I'm done!

It's been a long, but generally good week. Had a good seminar with an interesting researcher on Tuesday - he studies the hindbrain movement circuitry of zebrafish by imaging neural activity with laser-induced fluorescence as well as calcium indicators, and two-photon microscopy. Tuesday evening brought me back into the company of the Illini boardgames club - and played perhaps the <i>slowest</i> and most frustrating game of <a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13""><i>The Settlers of Catan</i></a> <b>ever</b>. It was during this game that I imagined how much more fun and exciting it would be to add a more 'martial' element to the game - since it's German, I think it'd go like this:

<b>Me:</b> ""I need some ore, you have anything you want to trade for some? I have some nice wood here.""
<b>Player:</b> ""Well, I <i>have</i> ore, but I need it, and you don't have anything I want..""
<b>Me:</b> ""Someone thinks you need to re-think my offer...specifcially the 5th Panzer Division. They're shelling your settlement and seizing your ill-gotten ore reserves under the cover of some strategically placed 88's, your ore now rightfully belongs to the glorious Blue Reich.""

I think I need to find a way to combine <i>Settlers</i> and <i>Panzerblitz</i> (<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/akhmed/"">akhmed</a>, want in?) :)

Today we had a special physiology department lecture - the speaker was <a href=""http://research.arc2.ucla.edu/cfm/lifesci/physcifaculty.cfm?FacultyKey=400"">Dr. Peter Narins</a>, from UCLA. Dr. Narins and my adviser were both graduate students together (in the same office, even) under one of the 'fathers' of frog auditory research, Dr. Robert Capranica of Cornell. Dr. Narins studies frog behavior - but he chooses more <i>fun</i> field sites than, say, central Missouri and Illinois. He's collaborated with my adviser in Chile and China, and has also worked on projects in the rain forests of French Guiana (where it is apparently a <b>local</b> call to Paris, and expensive long distance call to Brazil), to the coastal deserts of Namibia. After having lunch with him, I have a very high opinion of the man - he is extremely personable and friendly, with none of the stiffness one sometimes gets with academics. 

One of the most fascinating elements of his talk was about the seismic hearing capabilities of <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/641.shtml"">Grant's Golden Moles</a>, in Namibia. As you can see - these eyeless <a href=""http://www.orusovo.com/guidebook/images/goldenmole.jpg"">fellows</a> are pretty much the <a href=""http://www.dragonmount.com/WoT_Products/Images/comic_public_Myrddraal_lg.jpg"">Myrddraals</a> of the small and furry mammal set (I think my Geek stat just got a +2 for referencing that - and I don't even <b>read</b> the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series anymore!). The moles locate grassy tufts that lie at the bottom of Namib dunes - the only major clusters of life in the desert - via the seismic resonance of the grass blown by the wind! Once there, they use their acute sense of smell and further vibrational cues to locate and devour termites, spiders, lizards, etc. present in the tufts. 

I'm such a zoology dork that I find this <i>bitchin!</i>

After the talk was a kickass reception, with free wine and free dinner in the form of a wide array of appetizers, including chicken satay skewers, fresh cheese, smoked salmon and asparagus sushi, fresh fruit, and shrimp cocktail with cilantro and lime. At the end of the event, the staff gave the remaining attendants large ziplock bags, for us to take home the leftovers - I now have a few pounds of fruit, cheese, chicken and shrimp, and some bottles of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

Sometimes I think I'm a grad student <b>just</b> for the free food and booze!

Some other good links for ya:

Apparently at an LA art gallery, they recently had an exposition on the glories of <a href=""http://www.iam8bit.net/gallery/gallery.htm"">8-bit graphics</a>! I <b>want</b> that Dig-Dug painting.

While I'm on the subject of 80's nostalgia - <a href=""http://www.somethingawful.com"">Somethingawful</a> had a great recent Comedy Goldmine on the ol' <a href=""http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=2777"">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> books of yore. I read a whole MESS of these guys in elementary school - and even had a few, including a <i>Star Trek</i> one. Of course you start out as a lowly crew-member, and I recall your chances for survival to be about equal to those of your average <a href=""http://www.magiclibrary.net/rarities/inquest-red-shirt.jpg"">red-shirt</a>.

Finally, as akhmed knows, I enjoy the writings of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camile_Paglia"">Camile Paglia</a>. <a href=""http://www.salon.com/books/int/2005/04/07/paglia/index.html"">This </a> is but another reason to like her - enjoy!"

"event","So I'm watching the NCAA Finals, between Illinois and some unnamed opponent - only all the people there were from my High School class (Sparta HS class of '97), and the game was held at my elementary school gym. The main element was that <i>everyone</i> around me was recognizing me, and being patronizing, derisive, cruel, etc., and there was nothing I could do. I was surrounded in a sea of false politeness, sarcasm and derision. For whatever reason - I knew that I <i>had</i> to stay and see the game, but the environment was unbearable. I was seated, with others, on a large folded stack of gymnastics mats, and the mats kept falling over - knocking all 15 or so people off, and everyone kept looking at me, as if it were <i>my</i> fault.

When I woke up from this, I felt really depressed and stressed out - I can only think that this came from a recent AIM discussion with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/akhmed/"">akhmed</a> about middle and high school. It was just odd - a <i>bad</i> dream that left me with a profoundly disturbed feeling, but not an explicit <i>nightmare</i> of any sort. I'm sure that if I saw a therapist - he or she'd have great fun with this one!"

Other than that - not much going on - had two days of 70+ degree weather. I got to open my apartment windows and <i>air out</i> the place for the first time since October. I'd like to think that it made a sound like that of unscrewing your gas-cap - <i>SHHHHHHHHH!</i> - as all the evil spirits and foule aires are released.

In talking to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/akhmed/"">akhmed</a>, about the (im)proper uses of stem cell technology, he decried their use for the development of natural breast enhancement, or in the aide of <a href=""http://english.pravda.ru/fun/2001/08/10/12267.html"">penile re-attachment</a>(warning, contains NSFW (or lunch) picture).

Now, the following AIM exchange is included <b>just to make <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/akhmed/"">akhmed</a> happy:</b>

<b>af_neuro:</b> I think I'd be happy if my arms became cephalopodian tentacles. That'd just be cool :-)

<b>af_neuro:</b> And then I could marry a naked, poison-dart-frog colored anime chick :-)
<b>af_neuro:</b> Cuz- you know I'd be a freak, she's a freak, and of course - anime chicks love tentacles :-P

<a href=""http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/tcp/index.html"">Ahem.</a> BTW - I have met the original owner of the page, Dr. James Woods - who has forsaken the cold shores of Halifax for the more amenable shores at the <a href=""http://www.bbsr.edu"">Bermuda Biological Station for Research</a>. He gave a lecture last summer while I was taking a course there - about squid communication. He's a very 'lively' individual, and is anxious to get on with his research, which was on hold as he was in a leg-brace due to an encounter with a drunken driver on his scooter (ubiquitous in Bermuda).

<a href=""http://www.bmumford.com/art/"">Crackpot inventions!</a> (thanks, <a href=""http://www.metafilter.com"">Metafilter!</a>) Personally, I love the ""Frog Rock"" and ""Mystery box"", though I would combine them - to a box that laughs at you, and derides your masculinity in response to your futile attempts to divulge its secrets!

Perhaps the most amusing thing about <a href=""http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2005/3/29allen.html"">this humorous satire on Isaac Newton</a>, is that it's <b>not</b> far off from his real personality! People forget that Newton, in addition to being a genius and founder of modern physics, was also a believer in alchemy, biblical numerology, and a bitter, vindictive <i>ass</i> to boot. He belittled his opponents, and spent the majority of his later years - after being elected as a tax official - to pursuing and ruining his professional and personal enemies. One of these - the eminent (and mostly unappreciated) <a href=""http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/hooke.html"">Robert Hooke</a> suffered much of his wrath - his portrait was mysteriously <i>lost</i> during Newton's tenure as Royal Society president.

Finally - a set of documents dated 1943, and commissioned by the OSS (forerunner of the CIA) to analyze the personality and psychology of Adolf Hitler, has recently been <a href=""http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/donovan/hitler/"">declassified</a>. I've read through the first two sections, and although no doubt somewhat dated with regards to personality theory, it has been nevertheless fascinating. My favorite quote by the author comes after proscribing what should be done should the Fuhrer be captured by the Allies. He suggests that he be put permanently in a psychiatric hospital and his harangues and psychotic behavior recorded and filmed for the world - and German people - to see, and eventually tire of. After this suggestion he quips: 

<tt>If taken in a routine, scientific and undramatic manner the pictures [of an institutionalized Hitler] will become quite tiresome after a while and the people will get bored with Hitler in a year or so. (Trust science to take the drama out of anything)</tt>

Well, 2/3 questions are done, and I thoroughly rested up this weekend (and bought a crap of stuff - including some music and accessories to go along with my new iPod).

This week will still be busy - but more enjoyable. I need to futz around with some lab equipment, and I may actually get to start surveying some field sites - these are areas where my frogs have been found (according to the Illinois Natural History Survey people), and they may prove useful to do field work this spring/summer. Though I need to whip up a batch of forms for the owners of private land that some sites are on - to give me permission to look around and such.

<a href=""http://www.muar.ru/ve/2003/moscow/index_e.htm"">Urealised Moscow</a> - Proletariat dreams for a Glory on the Moscva that remained (for the most part) merely a glimmer in Uncle Joe's eye. Can't say I really like many of the designs - they lack the lines and curves that define the <i>Art deco</i> visuals that the West was putting out at the same time - and I <b>do</b> love <i>Art deco</i>. The Aeroflot building isn't too bad though - would've liked to have seen that one. What *is* needed - is more building with BIG-ASS statues on top around, we don't have enough of those!

I don't know if this is a gag or not, but in any case I present to you - <a href=""http://www.dogcondoms.com/"">Dog condoms</a>. The ""meat scented"" gets me every time!

<a href=""http://www.biomotionlab.ca/Demos/BMLwalker.html"">This site featuring 'point-light' animations</a> is most intriguing. I found it off of a 'Cognitive Science' <a href=""http://cognitivedaily.com/"">blog</a> (<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/theiage/"">theiage</a>, you may find this particularly interesting). What tickles my 'cool' button is what this reveals beneath our external conscious, or rather - what underlies it. It shows the assumptions and 'automatic processing' built into our brains over the eons of genetic and brain evolution. I speak of the facts that a series of coordinated dots in motion instantly and strongly connote the form of a human, and that by adjusting certain patterns of motion, we can infer gender, emotion, and physical form. This shows that while some aspects of our cognitive self <b>are</b> a <i>tabula rasa</i>, there is still a significant portion of which has a <i>lot</i> of 'built in' evolutionary knowledge and 'learning'.

<b>Ugh.</b> I heard this song on the great local indie station <a href=""http://www.1071theplanet.com"">107.1 The Planet</a>, and using bits of lyrics I heard, as well as their list of songs played in the last few hours (sorted alphabetically, not temporally, unfortunately) I <i>still</i> haven't found the song!

Life is good - at least for a while. Last night me and Anthony went to a friends house - where the occupants (2 MD/PhDs and their CS friend) and us played some Halo 2. Now I haven't played an FPS in a long while - and I <i>never</i> really enjoyed console FPS games, after a few games - I was having a blast. In one particular level - which I shall call ""The Giant Windmill Level"" - I got the sniper rifle, and proceeded to go on a mini-sniper spree - getting 6 people in a row. So, at the end - I still sucked, but not as much as when I started. I could <i>almost</i> buy an X-box just for that game...

Now, I've watched this <a href=""http://www.csh.rit.edu/~rage/TLGmedia/anim_pages/anewbunny.htm"">thing</a> at least 10 times - and I'm <i>still</i> cracking up - especially when Buzz Bunny screeches ""Extreeeeeme!""

Tomorrow - I need to go into lab for a few hours - I need to take care of some brain slices I've been letting stew in their buffer (sometimes I <b>love</b> having a profession where I can just casually mention having to take care of 'brain slices'). Then I need to check on some equipment at Best Buy that we might need in-lab. Most of next week I'll be working on my written quals - questions that my committee members will be giving me to take home and answer as best as I can in a time period - generally 1-2 days per professor. After that - I should be home-free until field work starts!"

Also spent some time trying to ensure a projector in my qual exam room - and I <b>did</b> have to inadvertently schedule the oral session during the Beckman/Engineering Open House (a pretty major thing around the university, and which attracts hundred and hundreds of people from around the state).

I also embarked on my first journal into that mysterious, hazy, and almost alchemy-like land of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"">histology</a> (the wiki link is ok - but the processing it lists is overly specific, like getting under a entry of pasta - a specific definition of linguine marinara).

It's fun-times with carcinogenic chemicals!!!

This great article entitled <a href=""http://wwwcdf.pd.infn.it/~loreti/science.html"">""Cargo Cult Science""</a>, written by the late, great Dr. Richard Feynman, is still sadly applicable and <b>very</b> relevant today, as it was 30 years ago. In many ways, one of the 'blind spots' of the current scientific methodology and general environs, is that repetition of experiments, confirming and strengthening previous results, and the reporting of <i>negative</i> findings is not as prevalent in most fields as Mr. Feynman would have. His writing style in this discussion of science is also amazing, I think, for it's intrinsic value for the scientist, as well as it's appeal to the layman.

Saw a job talk for a new vertebrate biology position - <a href=""http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/~dwylie/lab_members.htm"">Dr. Andrew Iwaniuk</a> - works in the evolution of advanced cognition in parrots, using physiology, behavioral studies and neuroanatomy. A <i>very</i> personable, intelligent, dynamic, and engaging guy - I hope we hire him.

Later had the dept. seminar for <a href=""http://psychology.arizona.edu/people/each_detail.php?option=1&detail=3&mtitle=Core%20Faculty"">Dr. Carol Barnes</a> - a heavyweight in the field of aging, cognitive behavior, and hippocampal function, and newly elected President for the <a href=""http://web.sfn.org/"">Society for Neuroscience</a>, of which I am a member. Now the nice thing about bigwigs like this, is that later, there was a reception at a Pysch professor's house (former postdoc in Dr. Barnes's lab) that was catered by the university - so I pretty much gorged on shrimp cocktail (taking in down my gullet like a sweater-wearing pelican, I was), bruschetta, crab-cakes, and <i>lots</i> of very smooth Italian red-wine. It's heartening to know that what Illinois lacks in weather or topography, it makes up for in free grub & booze!

Apparently - having a giant monster sticking a big radio transmitter around your neck before you 'get it on' with your honey causes stress, affecting the sex rations of your offspring - at least if you are a <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg18524896.100"">vole.</a> Not much to say about that one, other than it reminds me of a concept that I would really like to get caricatured on paper - the <b>vole cannon.</b>

Quiver at the sight of hundreds of tiny, horny, hungry rodents, hurtling at you at near-sonic velocity! You could even use field-mice as tracer-rounds!

It also seems that we, as a society, have failed in an essential goal - to design a robot arm using artificial muscle technologies that can successfully <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7113"">arm wrestle a 17 year old female</a>. <Sigh>.

I figure by this time Friday, I will either be under the influence of Lord Al'qo'hol, or curled up in a shaking ball of fear and bitter rage. Only time will tell...

I also did my first frog-brain extraction today. As it turns out, despite the small size and apparent translucence of their skull - a <a href=""http://www.livingunderworld.org/biology/images/frog_brain_2.gif"">frog's brain</a> is surprisingly difficult and tedious to remove from a <a href=""http://biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca/ftp/BIODIDAC/Zoo/Vertebra/Diagbw/Amph091b.gif"">frog's skull</a>.

We also worked out that next week I need to start on the written portion of my quals.

Beyond the obvious humor/bizarreness of this, I know one of the groups working on the project. In the summer of 2000, I was at Case Western Reserve University for a summer undergraduate internship, in the Chiel lab, working on the neurophysiology of the biting <a href=""http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/biomath/mike/network.html"">CPG</a> of <a href=""http://www.brembs.net/learning/aplysia/aplysia.html""><i>Aplysia californica</i></a>. When interviewing at CWRU for graduate study in <a href=""http://neuromechanics.cwru.edu/"">neuromechanics</a> in 2001, I learned about the project and met some of the graduate students mentioned, Greg Sutton. Apparently, on the side he called this project - ""The Buttmuncher"". Good thing to know in 10-20 years when us guys get this thing crawling up our 'hoo-has'!

Today was reasonable - I slept in, presented my poster for 2 hours (fortunately few people were interested in my work, other than a cute girl from Tulane), went to Techfront, and had a drink with Anthony at Crane Alley afterwords. I learned several things: 
<ul>
<li>It seems that few biologists (or at least potential biologists) care about science for science's sake</li>
<li>The BBC series <a href=""http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/"">Spaced</a> is a 'fookin awesome' show</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.getstoney.com/brewery.html"">Stoney Creek</a> Vanilla Porter is a <b>fantastic</b> beer</li>
<li>I <i>suck</i> at Foosball something fierce</li>
</ul>
I have also now just finished the last episode of season 1 of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>. <b>Damn.</b> I can't wait for season 2.

I summon forth <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7090"">this link</a>, not for purposes of snark, but merely because I think this find - if validated - is amazing. I'm still a bit skeptical, but after another year or two of solid work confirming the find as a separate species and I'll be convinced. In a way it's serendipitous, as I am currently reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684827123/qid=1109921265/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-5954184-1067201?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>The Song of the Dodo</i></a>, in which the subject of the many odd transformations that species undergo during evolution on islands is a central theme. One of the more prominent adaptations is either gigantism or <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/photogalleries/homo_floresiensis_1/"">dwarfism</a>. In some metaphysical way, I find the prospective evidence that the genus <i>Homo</i> is also thus malleable and subject to the same whims and constraints as other known <a href=""http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.hedweb.com/animimag/tortoisg.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.hedweb.com/animimag/tortoisg.htm&h=493&w=730&sz=98&tbnid=arT87fFm6j0J:&tbnh=93&tbnw=138&start=8&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dgiant%2Btortoise%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DG"">island</a> <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/chis/pygmy.htm"">oddities</a> comforting. Also, the inference of structure with modern imagine techniques is also an fascinating process.

As for things not Hobbit or Darwinian hip-hop in nature, not much. Continuing to finish reading desired papers by my oral quals on the 11th. Sent my dad a birthday card, and finally finished up and printed out my poster for this weekend. Also got to test out a new handheld GPS unit for the lab (I plan to use it in the field this spring/summer). The gadget's pretty neat: color screen, loadable maps, heck just the initializing ""Locating satellites"" was kinda neat in a 'wow-James-Bond-tech-is-now' sorta way.

In the course of reading a paper testing the validity of the Acoustic Adaptation hypothesis (that animal signals may have evolved to adapt to the particular acoustic features and constraints of the environment of the calling species), I came across the glory of the <a href=""http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/graphics/hoarym1.jpg"">Hoary Marmot</a>. For whatever reason, the species name struck me as a perfect Victorian-cockney insult for a member of the fairer sex : <i>""Oy! What a tasty bit 'o puddin' she'd be, bet ya she's a 'oary marmot 't the end though, eh?""</i>

Apparently, the US government has been studying into the development of a <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7077"">laser-plasma gun</a> that could incapacitate a person at a range of 2 miles by causing no damage but massively activating pain receptors.

On the other hand, I WANT MY LASER-RAY GUNS ALREADY DAMMIT!

In real life - finished my poster today. Got to print it tomorrow. I also have to set up the written part of my quals with each of my committee members (argh!). At least I get free food & booze at the Molecular & Cellular Biology open house on Friday. I need to be at my poster from 3-5 PM on Saturday, and due to that - and the fact that I want to listen to at least one of the faculty talks - I'll miss anime club. Now depending on whether or not I can weasel in on the free Japanese dinner for the open house (at Kamakura) - I may also decide to skip TechFront. The next week is going to be hell, because I need to seriously catch-up on my readings in preparation for my oral qual next Friday - so I don't think many of my 'current moods' for the next week and a half will be particularly good. Also haven't decided if I am going to attempt yet another failed experiment tomorrow - my auditory hardware is acting funny. I suppose that I'll try to carry on anyways - as the need to at least <i>look</i> like I'm trying to get data may mitigate the actual <b>lack</b> of said data.

Later I played an epic game of Axis & Allies, with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/gaudium_et_spes/"">gaudium_et_spes</a>, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sturmadler/"">sturmadler</a>, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/nonelf/"">nonelf</a>, and a friend of Chris. As usual, at the calling of the game, we figured that the Allies had won. I played Japan, and was having quite a good run, having destroyed the American fleet - which in turn did the same to mine. This gave me enough time to take out parts of eastern Russia, China, India, and eventually Persia. Then, when both U.S. and Japanese navies had been re-built, I decided to take on the Americans again, a Pearl Harbor v 2.0 of sorts (coupled with an admittedly iffy invasion of Alaska).

Unfortunately at this point, the <i>Lords of the Dice</i> abandoned me, and what <b>should</b> have been a slugfest in which pretty much both Japanese and U.S. forces perished (buying me more time to consolidate my forces, which were more strung out that a Las Vegas prostitute on coke...) became instead a bloodbath in which my navy and half my air force were annihilated, with barely a scratch to the American force. This enabled the Americans to deny me any movement of troops out of Japan, as well as to start 'island-hopping' to establish an air presence that would harass my production facilities. By this time, the stalemate in Europe was still going strong, but the obvious ability of the Russians to out-produce Germany made it merely a matter of time before the Allied victory. BLAST! another failure for the forces of evil!

Tomorrow is histology-and-poster day. I didn't get <i>nearly</i> as much work done on the latter as I had planned this weekend - and it needs to be pretty much done by Thursday. The histology shouldn't take up too much time, as all I need to do is perfuse the frog, remove the brain and shove it in fixative overnight. The evening's entertainment will involve dinner and a bar-crawl with most of the group mentioned above, which I am looking forward too, as I haven't had too many opportunities to hang out with fellow beer-snobs in a while!

Fun links 'o the day:
<a href=""http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/hapland.php"">Hapland</a> (thanks <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sturmadler/"">sturmadler</a>!) is an insidious and devious flash puzzle. It took me a while to solve (and I <b>did</b> have to look up a hint or two online), but was really neat, and hope the author makes more in the future.

The video ""Evil"" featured on <a href=""http://www.interpolny.com/video.php"">this page</a>, while coming from one of my favorite bands, <a href=""http://www.interpolny.com/"">Interpol</a>, has what may be perhaps the most <i>scary</i> puppet I've seen in a while, or at least since that acid trip and subsequent viewing of <i>The Muppet Show</i>.

It seems that during the heat of nerf-battle, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/gaudium_et_spes/"">gaudium_et_spes</a> was injured by an elevator door frame that just leapt out of nowhere onto his forehead! Last I heard he is getting a few stitches at Carle, other than that I'm sure he's ok - it simply proves his passion for the delicate flower that is nerf-combat! Now he can return with glorious <i>battle-scars</i> (really Chris, glad you're ok - and it was probably fortunate that about half the guys are Eagles and one part-time EMT, just in case).

All in all - it was a good ending to a bad day - and the first nerf-war I've been involved with in which blood has actually been shed!

I'm not that familiar with his works, but I can - at the very least - respect the man for this. In some way's it's kindred to the 'fantasy funeral' that I dreamed up during one of my halcyon days with akhmed back at <a href=""http://www.wm.edu"">William & Mary</a>. I desired to have the most 'All-American' funeral possible. My mortuary scenario involved each of the following:
<ul>
<li>Being held in a major open-air sports arena </li>
<li>The preacher would <i>parachute</i> into the funeral, and his parachute would trail a giant American flag</li> 
<li>Whole proceedings held on the 'Gonzo-vision' tv screen </li>
<li>Would include an entire brass band, playing lots of Souza</li>
<li>A car/motorcycle/jet-flyover 'half-time' show (fire would be involved in some way)</li>
<li>My ashes would be placed in the shells of 7 shotguns, and fired off into the air, at the crescendo of a metal song</li>
<li>After the service, a <b>massive</b> BBQ and buffet for all attendees would ensue</li>
</ul>

Things are ok - finally checked in with the 'rents. Dad is feeling fine - but I'm a bit worried as they really don't know the cause of the stroke, or how much of an indicator it is for future events. My dad doesn't show <i>any</i> of the standard risk factors - his not overweight, eats ok, exercises, low cholesterol. It may have something to do with his blood condition, it may not. It's that uncertainty that bothers me, and will continue to do so for a while.

Had a long conversation with my friend Anthony over God, politics, beliefs, and moral choices and dogma. I don't get to often wax philosophic about deep subjects, so this satisfied me. Then had another long phone chat with an old W&M friend Mike - in contrast our conversation was more oriented with pop culture, debauchery and music. Discourse-wise, it's been a good evening.

"event","Well, it's been a most <i>interesting</i> day...in the <b>Chinese</b> sense that is.

Woke up with a moderate hangover, which was remedied by taking 3 Ibuprofen, and sleeping in until 3.

I then get all 'dressed up' (nice sweater, olive green khakis, my nice wool overcoat), and spent an hour at JAC - got the last 2 episodes of <i>Venture Bros.</i>, the last half of <i>Last Exile</i>, and an episode of <i>Duckman</i>...in German. Surprisingly, the German voices are pretty close to the US ones...

After that, and a short 40 min at Techfront (got to watch an ep of <i>Red Dwarf</i>), I headed to the cash bar ahead of the Open House banquet. It was then that I noticed that my cell phone had been off since last night. I switched it on, and saw one message - I figured I'd look at it later. Around 6:30, I check the message - it's from my mom, and simply says to call back. This has me worried. You'll have to understand - as the designated 'responsible one' of my siblings, my parents assume that I'm generally fine and that I'll call them once a week or so. Thus, barring horrible events and emergencies - they <i>never</i> call me. The last time my parents called me was in the summer, when my grandfather died. However, my mother's voice didn't sound particularly panicked, but I was still worried. I call - but get the machine. I leave a message, and wander back to the banquet room. Over an hour and a half later, at a lull in dinner (dinner was not as good as previous years, but it was free, and the wine was also free, so why complain?) I try calling my sister in St. Louis, who I don't get along with all that great - meaning that we have the <b>best</b> sibling relationship in my family. She is, fortunately, fully informed on the situation.

Apparently, sometime on Wednesday evening, my father had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a 'mini-stroke'. My mom took him to the hospital, and he checked out OK - all normal, no damage. Apparently they did not answer as they were at a local party in their development. It seems that my mother didn't want to tell me, so as to not worry me, until the whole thing was over. I am not pleased by this in the least. Besides scaring the <b>crap</b> out of me, by not telling me what was going on in the message, she waited over 3 days to even try and contact me. So for the rest of the evening, I have been experiencing an odd mixture of happiness and abject fear. Happiness knowing that my dad's fine, and that I was having a good time at the banquet, and subsequent party, and fear at the whole stroke affair, and not knowing about it. I will talk to my mother tomorrow, and advise her <b>not</b> to delay telling me about things such as this in the future."

Made <b>edgy</b>.

In the <i>far future</i>.

When I first read of this 're-imagining', I thought - oh great, like the Burton <i>Planet of the Apes</i>, it should therefore contain confusing and absurd plots, bad cameos, and - of course - awkward, uncomfortable scenes of man-ape kissing and assorted sexual tension.

In slightly more upbeat news, I found out this morning, while getting my hair cut by my Vietnamese-American stylist-type-person, that a local Chinese/Thai place, heretofore only know by me for excellent Pad Thai, also has a serviceable pho. I <b>must</b> try this. I am a true lover of soups and stews from all over the world, and though it was quite expensive and not as high quality as other establishments, I do occasionally miss our only local Vietnamese restaurant, which closed some time ago - to be turned into yet <i>another</i> Mexican joint. I predict this new place will close within two years - it's a very bad location, especially if one wants to attract a significant undergraduate clientele. If the pho at this unexpected source (<i>Golden Wok</i> on University) fails muster, then I will just have to visit DC more often, and go to Pho 29 in Fairfax county. Mmmm...now I have sudden urge for some beef tendon and noodles in broth..."

This satisfies me.

Earlier in the evening, I attempted once again to actually <b>cook</b> something - Shepherd's Pie. Unfortunately, it almost turned out to be, if not a 'culinary abortion' as Stewie from <i>Family Guy</i> would say, perhaps then a 'culinary miscarriage'. I didn't sufficiently drain the grease from the cooked meat before putting it in the oven, forming the choice: do I accept a mushy and non-cohesive meal, or risk a smoke-filled apartment (with the added bonus of a probable grease-fire!)? I chose the former. Next time: pork loin <i>a la</i> George Foreman. I'll make a nice sauce to drizzle on it.

<i>Sigh.</i>

The following is <b>opinion</b> of myself, as although I am a biologist, I am <b>not</b> an expert in bird behavior.

I wish people would not push agendas and attribute things to animals with which their biology is incompatible. Now I am, in general, a support of Gay/Lesbian/Whatever rights, but in this case, their ignorance of avian biology makes them look foolish. Birds, unlike the vast majority of mammals, are mostly monogamous, with male/female pairs often breeding together for several seasons (or life, in the case of many species). In addition to this strong pair-bond, birds are very seasonal, and very horny when in the breeding 'mood'. This is often why parakeets, parrots, etc get <i>very</i> attached with their owner or get very stressed if kept alone without social interaction. They are looking to bond and mate with a fellow bird that suits their fancy - and the fact that the other 'bird' may be of the same sex, their human owner, or a mirror image of themselves, is rather irrelevant with regards to their biological drives. 

So, what we have here are a group of male <i>endangered</i> penguins that, with the long-term shortage of females - pair-bonded to each other. The zoo has, I think, a legitimate desire to help repopulate, and that would require separating the male-male pairs, to encourage breeding. Now, I do believe the many accounts of homosexual behavior that have been observed in nature, but I think here we are dealing with a particular set of circumstances and a very hard-wired reproductive axis that are known to exist in many birds, and I think that some homosexual rights groups, with their agenda 'hammer' and, in seeing a cognitive framework that I don't believe is there, is starting to see everything as a 'nail'. I think this is a problem with many vocal and passionate advocacy groups - they fight and argue for a give cause for so long, that the start to view the world through the <i>lens</i> of that cause, which can be most detrimental to their success. <i>Whew!</i>

In non-homosexual seabird matters - tonight, I cleaned my bathroom. Tub, toilet, sink, floor. <a href=""http://www.homemadesimple.com/swiffer/index.html"">Swiffer</a>, Thy Will Be Done. On the good news front, it turns out that I don't <i>necessarily</i> have to finish the poster for the Dept. Open House, but I could wait until a related Open House in March. W00t.

So, in the end, I may not be getting any this Valentine's Day, but at least some gay penguins <i>are</i>. Here's to the glory of nature!"

Imposters posing as ExxonMobil and National Petroleum Council (NPC)
representatives delivered an outrageous keynote speech to 300 oilmen
at GO-EXPO, Canada's largest oil conference, held at Stampede Park in
Calgary, Alberta, today.

The speech was billed beforehand by the GO-EXPO organizers as the
major highlight of this year's conference, which had 20,000
attendees. In it, the ""NPC rep"" was expected to deliver the long-awaited
conclusions of a study commissioned by US Energy Secretary
Samuel Bodman. The NPC is headed by former ExxonMobil CEO Lee
Raymond, who is also the chair of the study. (See link at end.)

In the actual speech, the ""NPC rep"" announced that current U.S. and
Canadian energy policies (notably the massive, carbon-intensive
 exploitation of Alberta's oil sands, and the development of liquid
coal) are increasing the chances of huge global calamities. But he
reassured the audience that in the worst case scenario, the oil
industry could ""keep fuel flowing"" by transforming the billions of
people who die into oil.

""We need something like whales, but infinitely more abundant,"" said
""NPC rep"" ""Shepard Wolff"" (actually Andy Bichlbaum of the Yes Men),
before describing the technology used to render human flesh into a
new Exxon oil product called Vivoleum. 3-D animations of the process
brought it to life.

""Vivoleum works in perfect synergy with the continued expansion of
fossil fuel production,"" noted ""Exxon rep"" ""Florian Osenberg"" (Yes
Man Mike Bonanno). ""With more fossil fuels comes a greater chance of
disaster, but that means more feedstock for Vivoleum. Fuel will
continue to flow for those of us left.""

The oilmen listened to the lecture with attention, and then lit
""commemorative candles"" supposedly made of Vivoleum obtained from the
flesh of an ""Exxon janitor"" who died as a result of cleaning up a
toxic spill. The audience only reacted when the janitor, in a video
tribute, announced that he wished to be transformed into candles
after his death, and all became crystal-clear.

At that point, Simon Mellor, Commercial & Business Development
Director for the company putting on the event, strode up and
physically forced the Yes Men from the stage. As Mellor escorted
Bonanno out the door, a dozen journalists surrounded Bichlbaum, who,
still in character as ""Shepard Wolff,"" explained to them the
rationale for Vivoleum.

""We've got to get ready. After all, fossil fuel development like that
of my company is increasing the chances of catastrophic climate
change, which could lead to massive calamities, causing migration and
conflicts that would likely disable the pipelines and oil wells.
Without oil we could no longer produce or transport food, and most of
humanity would starve. That would be a tragedy, but at least all
those bodies could be turned into fuel for the rest of us.""

""We're not talking about killing anyone,"" added the ""NPC rep."" ""We're
talking about using them after nature has done the hard work. After
all, 150,000 people already die from climate-change related effects
every year. That's only going to go up - maybe way, way up. Will it
all go to waste? That would be cruel.""

Security guards then dragged Bichlbaum away from the reporters, and
he and Bonanno were detained until Calgary Police Service officers
could arrive. The policemen, determining that no major infractions
had been committed, permitted the Yes Men to leave.

Canada's oil sands, along with ""liquid coal,"" are keystones of Bush's
 Energy Security plan. Mining the oil sands is one of the dirtiest
forms of oil production and has turned Canada into one of the world's
worst carbon emitters. The production of ""liquid coal"" has twice the
carbon footprint as that of ordinary gasoline. Such technologies
increase the likelihood of massive climate catastrophes that will
condemn to death untold millions of people, mainly poor.

""If our idea of energy security is to increase the chances of climate
calamity, we have a very funny sense of what security really is,""
Bonanno said. ""While ExxonMobil continues to post record profits,
they use their money to persuade governments to do nothing about
climate change. This is a crime against humanity.""

""Putting the former Exxon CEO in charge of the NPC, and soliciting
his advice on our energy future, is like putting the wolf in charge
of the flock,"" said ""Shepard Wolff"" (Bichlbaum). ""Exxon has done more
damage to the environment and to our chances of survival than any
other company on earth. Why should we let them determine our future?""

"event","my mom no longer has a tumor...but she does have seizures if she doesn't take her medicine. hopefully the two she has already had will keep her from forgetting to take her meds, like she did last week. well, that and the pill organizer i purchased for her. i will probably go back up to the suburbs to see her this weekend and help her with chores, since she's not supposed to drive (another thing she had to be reminded of...can't drive a car if you might have a seizure). once her brain has all healed up she will be able to stop taking the meds hopefully and she should be fine afterwards. the operation went really well."

"event","i'm not going on vacation to europe this week as i had planned, because my mom has a brain tumor.

my mother has had health problems for the last few months...chronic pain, stiffness and occasional numbness in her neck, arm and face. also she's had some other problems with her eyes, etc for the last year or so. i've gone up to the 'burbs the last few weekends to help her out with shopping and chores because she's experienced some weakness on her left side.

so far, no one has been able to explain her symptoms, but monday last week, at her doctors request, my mother went in for an MRI of her head. they discovered a 4cm mass in her head. after further testing the doctors decided that the tumor was probably a benign meningioma, sitting on the top of her left frontal lobe. they suspect that the tumor has been growing slowly for at least the last 10 years or so. the tumor is not life-threatening, at least not at this point. the tumor is sitting on the membrane surrounding the brain, and the doctors do not believe the tumor has yet spread into the actual brain tissue and they are hoping it has not yet attached itself to any nearby blood vessels. the tumor is beginning to cause pressure on her brain though, and the tumor, if left alone would probably continue to grow and cause more problems as it gets bigger.

the doctors do not know for certain whether the tumor is responsible for her other symptoms, since its on the wrong side of her brain to cause problems on the left side of her body. but her EEG did show some abnormal electrical activity in her brain, which may have something to do with her other symptoms.

she was admitted to the hospital by her doctor last wednesday for further testing and bedrest and to consult with a neurosurgeon. i left work early on thursday to drive up there to visit her in the hospital and help her out with some things like helping her file her paperwork for medical leave from her job and chores and such.

I also went to talk with her doctors to find out more about what was going on, since at that point my mom wasn't able to communicate the details of her care to me very well, and i think she was freaking out quite a bit at first. so she gave me the impression at first that the tumor was much more life-threatening than it probably is in fact. the problem is serious of course, but not something to give up all hope over, which is the way my mom was acting at first. after talking to her neurosurgeon about it, i was able to make the situation a little more clear to her and calm her down a bit...even though the surgeon had already told her all the same things. They discharged my mom on Friday evening after they finished her tests, since she was doing fine and able to look after herself, but I came by to help her get home.

her neurosurgeon has recommended surgery to remove the tumor as quickly as possible, not because of any immediate danger, but more because the quicker it is removed, the easier the operation should be. if the tumor gets larger, complete removal might become more complicated. right now the doctors think the tumor is pretty much just sitting on top of the dura around the brain...unless the tumor has grown into a nearby blood vessel or into the space between the two hemispheres of the brain, they should be able to just peel the tumor completely off, without leaving any behind, or only leaving a small enough portion so that the rest can be burned out. if the surgery goes without any complications (no need to close off larger blood vessels, no bleeds, no major irritation to the brain tissue) she should recover quickly from surgery and the tumor in all likelihood would not come back. if it did come back, it would probably come back in the same place, but would not spread to other parts of her body if it reoccured. there is of course the potential danger associated with this type of surgery as there is with any type of brain surgery...potential irritation of the brain which could cause seizures or partial paralysis and various other complications, possible bleeding in the brain which is of course a serious problem. but all her doctors are convinced that given her relative young age and health, removal is the best course to follow.

my mother has consented and her surgery was scheduled for 8:30am this Friday, but it got delayed to next week, the Tuesday right after Memorial Day. I went to her surgical consult with her neurosurgeon this Monday, where we went over the details for the operation, and scheduled some more tests for this week, CT scans of her head and neck, and a consult with a cardiologist. while she was in the hospital last week they gave her an EKG and they found some abnormal indicators so they wanted her to be checked out by the cardiologist before they moved ahead with the surgery. that's why they've delayed it until after Memorial Day.

i'll probably be staying with my mom in the burbs for a little while, maybe a week or so, on and off, during her surgery and after she gets discharged to keep an eye on her, so that someone is around if there are any complications. the surgery will take a few hours and she'll probably be in recovery at the hospital for a couple days afterward. if she's doing okay, able to walk on her own and not in need of any specialized care, they'll probably discharge her at that point and she'll go home, but will need people to check in on her for a while to make sure there aren't any problems.

it's a long story, but due to various factors, my mom doesn't have anyone else close to her who will be able to check in on her regularly, so most of the after care will be up to me.  my mother does have relatives in Chicago, but she doesn't get along well with any of them. she's managed to piss them all off for one reason or another. basically, I'm the only one who still speaks to her. so, i'm not exactly thrilled about the situation, being that i don't live nearby her, i have to take off a lot of time from work to do it, and i'll have to spend all the time sitting around her house in the suburbs with nothing to do, but i'm doing it.

also, the vacation will have to be delayed. right now amy and I are working on re-scheduling all our flights and hotels, etc for later in the summer. i feel bad for amy, because she has to re-do everything and all the planning now that she spent most of the spring working on for this vacation.

hopefully, this will all be over quickly and my mom will be all better soon and able to be on her own again.

i'll update when i can."

please forward widely...

Champaign-Urbana Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW) Speak-out

Krannert Art Museum 
500 East Peabody Dr 
Champaign IL 61820  
 
Date: May 5, 2007 
 
Time: 5:20-6:00pm (Please be there for start of program) 
 
Come out to hear the stories of what it means to be in the United States Military
and on the ground in Iraq.  These testimonies will make it clear why the troops need
to come home NOW.

Speaking: ""a performance that bridges distance and rejects mediation"" 
 
In this performance three ""Iraq Veterans Against the War"" bridge the 
distance to the Iraq War with memories.  These memories are spoken 
testimonies that reject the sensationalized, binary, and ideological 
narratives presented by politicians and mass media.   
 
In contrast the emotions and anxieties of a personal war experience are 
embraced, resulting in layers of dialog that complicate not only mass 
media's narrative of the war but also the visual memory expressed in the 
painting ""Between F.O.B. Junction City and the Tigres River...""

"event","squirrels are bastards. if you did not know this already, know this now. apparently, squirrels will crawl into your car engine compartment and nest...and chew on your wires. luckily this has not happened to me personally yet, but apparently there's a squirrel or two that has a taste for homebuilding in expensive foreign cars parked at my building. it has become an annoyance i have to deal with.

despite this, i refuse to trap them. i don't seriously believe that the creepy dude at the pest control company actually ""relocates"" the squirrels he traps. i'm pretty sure he just offs them after he traps them and then charges for it. people will just have to deal with it, or find some way to discourage them on their own.

i'm trying out fox urine around the lot perimeter and under the cars. i don't know...it's reputed to work. i guess we'll see. man that stuff stinks.

in the meantime i'll be checking under the hood of my car more often than a mob-informant."

i think i'll just stay home with some movies and rest up. maybe try eating some real food, now that my wounds are starting to close up more. anyway i want to get an early start tomorrow morning; head up to hoopeston to check on my family's grave site, see if my dad's new grave marker has been installed. plus i want to work a bit tomorrow. so, tonight i think should be devoted to rest. sorry if anyone missed me at the chicago thing.

hopefully, I can go cavorting in chicago sometime soon.

"event","i went to see my friend Jim at Andrew McFarland State Mental Health Facility in Springfield, IL earlier this evening. he's stuck there until he gets another hearing in December, currently receiving court-mandated in-patient treatment for his occassional madnesses. it was odd, it was my first time visiting someone incarcerated in a secured facility of any kind. Jim and I sat for about 30-45 minutes in the lobby of his ward and chatted, in semi-privacy (there was someone typing and griping to themself in an adjacent office, and nurses walked in and out occassionally). I brought him some hard candy and AA batteries. Hard candy is a necessity there since it's a non-smoking facility. Peppermints replace cigarettes there, it's what you trade with people to get other things you want, and also since there's not much to do outside therapy  or reading, they help to pass the time. I got him the sugarless kind, because there's not much room for exercise either. Jim said that on Tuesdays there is a woman there who does pilates, so he's started doing pilates.

although i felt bad for not going to visit him earlier, i'm still glad i waited. now that he's been medicated for a few weeks and gotten some therapy he's seems to be much more lucid and in control of his own thoughts than he's been in a long time. not that he was ever really that bad, but it's definitely much easier to hold a normal conversation with him. he definitely seems now like he could relate normally to people and not get himself arrested. he's bored of course, unhappy to be stuck inside, not free to come and go as he pleases. he's happy with his meds though, which is good, but of course he would be much happier taking them on an outpatient basis.

it is kind of laughable that he should be put there, he shares his ward with murderers and child molestors...people with serious mental health issues, people who are seriously dangerous when not receiving treatment and medication. one of his roommates has been in that facility for 10 years of a 30 year sentence, supposedly for killing his father. Jim says he's nice enough though, and that his other roommate is not that bad. Jim said he was rather anxious when they first put him in there, surrounded by all these seriously disturbed people, but he's gotten used to it.

It's sad, but I guess this is all the state can provide. When someone like Jim gets into minor trouble for untreated mental illness the state doesn't have any place to put him except a place like McFarland or just regular jail. It's good that he's getting treatment and medication, because he needed it, but its funny that he's been put in a facility with such tight security and restrictions for busting out a TV screen in a bar. it seems like they'll just keep delaying his hearings until he's served the full 9 months of treatment that they originally mandated. Jim hopes they'll let him out early in Dec. at his next hearing, but he may be in there until April.

i'm going to try to visit him fairly regularly from now on, bring him more candy.

on a personal note, the holes in my mouth are annoying the hell out of me. i'm still sticking to the soft foods to avoid irritating them further.


I may be in Chicago on Saturday night to check out a free performance at the Chicago Symphony. it's at the Symphony Center on Michigan at 7pm.  if anyone is interested in joining me or meeting up later, give me a call, 369-2039."

"event","i'm not used to pharmaceutical grade pain killers. i just took a 500 mg dose of hydrocodone, a generic for vicodin, to help me forget about the 4 large holes that have been left in my mouth by the removal of all 4 of my wisdom teeth. only one was impacted and in any danger of affecting my other teeth, but figured the other 3 would only cause me problems later, so i had them all removed yesterday morning.

the painkillers do numb the nominal pain in the jaws, but more they just make you feel good, lightly sleepy and overall rather pleasant, so you don't care so much about the fact that the holes in your jaw kind of ache and feel gross.

i've never been under anesthesia before, it was interesting. exactly what i expected, but still surprising to experience.

amy took me to the oral surgeon and looked after me afterward. she was a little upset that i wasn't more nervous and apprehensive about the whole thing. i just abandoned her in the waiting room without a kiss or a goodbye or a request for holding my hand when the nurse called my name. i was just too excited to get it all over with.

after i put on my gown and got seated in the dentist chair a woman prepared to put an IV in my arm. she kept singing along to the radio in the room as she prepared to stick me...""you are the sunshine of my life..."" As the other people in the room made fun of her singing and she began to run the medication into my IV all I remember (at all, clearly or otherwise) was my muscles starting to feel heavy and my eyes getting a little heavy and starting to feel rather pleasant within about 5 seconds, and then literally I was out like a light. the very next thing i remember is slowly trying to open my eyes lying on a bed to look at the clock on the wall...about an hour had passed. i had ice packs on my jaws (i'm wearing them now), i felt very drowsy and out of it, and cotton in my mouth.

i was aware of what was happening, but found it hard to really focus on anything or form coherent thoughts. i think it was the most passive perception of events I have ever experienced. amy and the nurse helped me out to the car...i had absolutely no sense of time passing. i just remember snipets of events, connected in chronological order only by their context.

amy drove over to the walgreens next to the surgeons office to fill my perscriptions and buy me some apple sauce and chocolate pudding while i laid half-conscious in the car, and occasionally tried to drink water from my water bottle over my still numbed lower lip.

unfortunately when amy came back to the car, my car wouldn't start...we found out later because I had loose battery cables, and some other things wrong as far as the battery was concerned, anyway we couldn't get the car started at the time and had to call to get it towed. although I don't really remember how it all happened, I tried in my haze to help her restart my car, then instructed her to call my dealer to have a tow truck come out to tow my car to the shop. amy lead me from car, to tow truck cab, to garage office, to shuttle van and back to my apartment, all the while i was in a haze, with ice packs on my cheeks, holding a half-eaten container of applesauce and a bottle of water. ocassionally i would play with my lower lip which was completely numb from the local anesthetic and it felt like it was swollen to 3 times its normal size...which it wasn't. i'm sure i cut a pretty funny figure.

i'm feeling pretty good now, regardless of the hydrocodone i took. i have my follow-up appointment tomorrow morning, so lets hope everything looks good and that I can start eating some real solid food soon. i'm getting tired of soup, applesauce, pudding and milkshakes.

that's all for now."

"event","so, apparently, not only are anarchists unable to wash, they can't clean either. left a big mess. the custodian and i both worked on getting things straightened up at work today. i have a table i'll need to fix too. luckily, the conference organizer seemed cool with letting me bill them for the extra time to do the clean-up stuff.

talking about smelly and messy...
lollapalooza this weekend was fun. althought it was much bigger, more crowded and more full of douche-bags than pitchfork fest was, the weather was much more agreeable for lollapalooza and the overall festival seemed much more enjoyable. don't get me wrong, it was still quite muggy and hot at times, but not oppressively so like at pitchfork, and many times it was actually quite nice. amy and i took our time at the fest and took it easy, just saw the bands we really wanted to see, and didn't break our backs trying to get around to every little thing.

we saw: Sleater-Kinney (in their probable last Chicago performance ever...Amy cried...Carrie is hottt), Ween (Amy is a fan, i'd never heard that much of their stuff before, but it was fun), Built to Spill, Sonic Youth (probably my favorite set of theirs i have ever seen), The Flaming Lips (silly fun), The New Pornographers (!!!), Andrew Bird with Martin Dosh, The Shins, and Wilco.

I hadn't seen Wilco live in a really long time. is it just me or has Jeff Tweedy gotten way, way happier and upbeat than he has been in the past.

we sweated a lot in the throng at the front of the crowd for sonic youth.

otherwise we spent the weekend negotiating metra train schedules to get to grant park from my mom's place in the suburbs and rushing around on city buses to get back to union station in time to catch the infrequent late trains home.

overall, it was a very fun weekend.

on saturday night, after a long hard day at the festival, and waiting for the 10:40 train to Schaumburg, Amy and I stopped to eat at this place http://www.russianteatime.com/

which is right in front of the Art Institute. i hadn't been there in probably over 7 or 8 years, but i remembered the food there being very tasty. we had a nice bottle of riesling and bilinchiki for appeitizers. i also had a cup of the broscht, and we enjoyed the nice dark bread until our entrees came. amy had the beef stroganoff (which was excellent) and i had a plate of wild game sausages (i don't recall all the animals i ate, but i believe buffalo was one of them) which came with marinated slices of eggplant, horseradish, and roasted potatoes.  all in all a very enjoyable and satisfying meal. it was nice to have a late night restaurant to go to with hearty food in downtown, now that Berghoff is semi-closed down/gotten rid of it's unionized employees.

dont' know when we'll go to chicago again, but amy wants us to go back to Russian Tea Time in the winter to eat again, maybe after visiting the Art Institute."

"event","i just met a group of anarchists and helped them move a trailer into a space in the parking lot.  they're here for this weekend conference thing on anarchy and christianity.  i assume the trailer contains their anarchist gear (big puppets and musical instruments and what-not).

apparently anarchists don't believe in showering, it's one thing to travel and be sweaty and not have that many chances to shower, it's another to sport the solid wall of stink that only comes about from stubbornly refusing to bath for weeks at a time and not changing your clothes, ever.

this does not characterize ever anarchist of course, just the ones who tour.

i leave for chicago at 5:30pm after work and showering.

friday, saturday and sunday is loolapalooza.

hopefully, the anarchists won't leave me a big mess on Monday morning to come back to."

"event","Haven't done this in a while, but here's my post.

went to pitchfork fest this last weekend...as jess pointed out, very hot and miserable, both days, but still managed to stay conscious long enough to hear these bands:

Mountain Goats
Destroyer
Art Brut (heard from a distance but did not watch)
Ted Leo and the Pharmacists
The Walkmen
The Futureheads (heard snipets from a distance but did not watch)
The Silver Jews (heard snipets from a distance, then decided to go home)

Mission of Burma
Devendra Banhart
Yo La Tengo

the second day was not very exciting and a second day of oppressive heat was just too much to care about seeing any more bands, so we left early Sunday, after arriving late.

Highlights were Destroyer, Ted Leo, and The Walkmen. Mission of Burma's set was pretty awesome too, but unfortunately they played in the middle of the day in intense heat, which made it hard to enjoy such a rockin' set. My personal favorite moment was when Ted Leo bashed himself in the head repeatedly with the mic while singing the ""beaten and bloodied"" line in Ballad of the Sin Eater. He cut his forehead and ended his set with blood running down his face. Also, a guy behind me in the crowd passed out from heat exhaustion and nearly took a header into my legs.

i'd never heard much art brut before, so i didn't have high expectations, and those expectations were not surpassed. not impressed at all. futureheads, what i heard at least weren't that interesting. and silver jews sounded interesting, but a little too mellow for being the first night headliner.

i was excited about seeing yo la tengo, but there set was pretty lackluster. i was happy to leave early when we did.

people watching was also lots of fun. using the port-a-potties was not very much fun.

i saw lots of people that i know, from a distance, but didn't say hi to most of them, it was just too hot to put that much effort into anything but listening to music and trying to stay cool.

next weekend is Lollapalooza. let's hope it's not quite so miserable. i'm looking forward to catching what will probably be Sleater-Kinney's last show ever in Chicago (or anywhere else in Illinois by that token), as well as possibly catching sets by Ryan Adams, Iron and Wine, Ween, Built to Spill, Sonic Youth, The New Pornographers, The Flaming Lips, Wilco, The Shins, Andrew Bird and Broken Social Scene."

1. I really like to be groomed, i know most people like to be groomed to some degree, but i REALLY like it, included having hairs pulled out with tweezers, having blackheads removed, and various things on my skin squeezed/picked off. i've never received a pedicure or manicure, but i'm sure i'd like that too...oh, and i like going to the dentist.

2. Sort of related to #1, I can't stand having fingernails or toenails, and I obsessively cut them as short as i possibly can without bleeding.

3. I like to steal things, but not for monetary value, just for utilitarian value or for the thrill of it...i once stole a single straw out of a package of straws at a grocery store...i just needed the one for a project i was working on.

4. I like being slapped.

5. I am cheap and stingy when I'm by myself a lot of the time, but always generous when with others.

6. I like to walk around nude at home with the air too cold, so that i have to get a blanket...this is easy and fairly cheap to do in winter but can be expensive in the summer.

I don't know six people who haven't already taken this quiz, so just do it if you want to i guess."

i am back in the U.S. after spending the last two weeks travelling aboard, mostly in Berlin and Glasgow and points in between, and many plane rides (6 total).  it was a fun trip, but honestly, i missed the dirty u.s. and i'm happy to be back in the belly of the beast...it's warm and comfortable in here.

i think Berlin was my favorite part of the trip.  After some travel shananigans while laying over and transfering flight/airports in London we made it to Berlin-Schoenfeld, which has a cool passport stamp by the way.  Berlin is very clean, very orderly, cozy and pretty for the most part, and best of all had an awesome public transportation system.  you could get just about anywhere you wanted to go in the city easily and relatively cheaply using the intricate network of subways/trains/buses and streetcars.  i have to say it's one of the things i probably miss the most about Berlin.  other personal highlights of Berlin for me: great fresh bread, everywhere, and the sandwich shops; the turkish food, doeners anytime of the day or night; the ice cream parlors; the german food at the markthall restaurant; berliner-weiss with the waldmeister flavoring, saying ""tchuss!"" to people when you leave; using the euro (despite the 1.4 exchange rate). the people, though polite enough, were kind of snooty.  i think berliners are a little full of themselves these days, but who can blaim them, they have a pretty awesome city.

we went all over berlin (both old east and west), stayed at a hostel on koepenicker strasse, near the old east/west border, looked at remnants of the old wall, brandenburg gate, alexanderplatz, postdamer platz, unter den linden (the main boulevard where hitler youth would have marched in the 30's), reichstag, toured the river spree, the jewish museum, checkpoint charlie museum, sachsenhausen concentration camp, and lots of other stuff.

also went to glasgow, scotland.  the only things i'll really miss about glasgow will be carol, auggie and jana.  i won't really miss the food or much else about the city.  it's a beautiful city, and the people are nice enough, but glasgow is a little too trashy for me.  and the public transportation sucks.  fuck the british pound with it's shitty exchange rate.  i can't say much for how glaswegians eat, although i did subject myself to the full english breakfast one day (fried eggs with soft yolk, chips, baked beans, sausages, bacon, black pudding, fried mushrooms and tomatos).  for those of you who don't know, black pudding is dried blood. still it was fun and it was good to see carol and jana and auggie.

i was pretty wiped out by the flights back home.  we stayed with my mom for a few days once we got back to chicago.  she took us to arlington race track and to some casino on lake michigan over in indiana. now, she does work in a casino, yes...but still i'm not sure why she always takes us gambling when we go to see her.  neither amy or i really like to gamble that much.  i think she only takes us because we usually win something when she takes us gambling. on race #2 at arlington i won a two dollar bet on the #8 horse, O'Bradovich, to win at odds of 15/2.  not too bad.  then when we went to the casino we gambled on the wheel of fortune 25 cent slots with my mom's $40.  about $37 into her money we won $250 and cashed out.  we split the winnings 3 ways.

now, i'm back home and look forward to getting back to work...and paying off my credit card bill from my trip.

Tchuss!"

i leave for the old world on sunday.  berlin and glasgow here i come.

so, don't expect anything out of me for a couple more weeks, as i will most likely not be accessing the internet during my trip for any considerable length...if i do, it will be only to clear out my inbox.

if you message me, don't be upset if i don't reply.

and don't call me either, i won't be bringing my cell phone.

On April 20, the Illinois Disciples Foundation (IDF) presents...

*******************************
""Breaking the Silence of Torture:
Survivor and Activist Dong Tizon Speaks Out""

Thursday, April 20
7-9pm
Wisegarver Lounge at IDF

Free and open to the public!
*******************************

Orlando ""Dong"" Tizon is a Filipino activist who was imprisoned and
tortured under the Marcos regime for his activism with the rural poor
community in the Philippines. He is currently the Assistant Director of
the Torture Abolition Survivors Support Committee (TASSC) International.

Tizon was arrested on September 21, 1982 in Davao City, Philippines. In
the first three weeks of his imprisonment he was kept blindfolded and
incommunicado in a military camp. He suffered beatings, endless
interrogations, mock execution and solitary confinement during his
imprisonment. He was released in April 1986 after the Marcos regime
collapsed.

Subsequently he earned a doctorate in sociology. He has been with TASSC
International since 2000 and is presently the Assistant Director. TASSC
International is the only organization founded by and for survivors of
torture. It was established in 1998, on the guiding principles that
torture is a crime against humanity and that survivors are the strongest
and most effective voice in the campaign to end the practice of torture.
For more information on TASSC International, please visit
http://www.tassc.org.

>From Tizon's statement before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1998:

<I>""I am glad that human rights is beginning to be included in U.S. foreign
policy calculations. But we all need to do more to rid our planet of this
'plague of the twentieth century' which is torture. We must widely
disseminate information about the practice and its effects on individuals
and society. I strongly ask that more resources be made available for
centers treating the survivors of torture.""</I>

Tizon will share his experiences as a torture survivor and how it led him
to become an activist. He will also discuss his current work, especially
how the use of torture is still so relevant with situations like Abu
Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, etc. Afterwards, there will be a facilitated
discussion.

Cosponsored By: Activist Forum, Amnesty International #124, Council on
American-Islamic Relations (UI Chapter), McKinley Foundation, National
Organization for Women (UIUC Chapter), Philippine Student Association,
Progressive Resource/Action Cooperative (PRC), Socialist Forum, U of I
Gender and Women Studies Program, University YMCA, U-C Friends Peace and
Service Committee, and Vietnam Veterans Against the War (CU Chapter).

we were out at busey woods to see the early spring wildflowers.  didn't see anything too rare or especially exciting, but did see many of my favorites, all the things you would commonly expect to see this time of year in that habitat.

here's what we saw that was in bloom right now:

yeah, i know, lots of white and pinks...but that's what's up right now.  no sign of dutchman's breeches though, which was disappointing.  they may already be gone.

and unfortunately, the blue bells were just starting to go out of bloom:

There will of course be more to come as the season wears on.  There were of course the early signs of other plants just starting to come up but which won't flower for a while yet, wild geraniums, waterleaf, buttercups, red trilliums, wild ginger.  i'll let you know what we see the next time we go out there."

"event","static electricity.  static is a bitch.  that's all i got to say about that.  the air is too dry, and static is a bitch.

i've resorted to using my keys to touch anything metallic first before i touch it with my body, to discharge myself and save myself from a severly painful static discharge.  yet, i still sometimes find myself shocked when accidentally touching something metallic and grounded, which seems to be about 2-3 times a day.

unfortunately, the key trick does nothing for me when i kiss amy and we're wearing our wool coats.  at least that is kind of cute though."

"event","lots of food, lots of animal collective, lots of chicago.

amy and i got going kind of late, didn't get to downtown chicago until 2:30pm.  at that point the line for berghoff was still about a 2 hour wait, so we decided to have a late lunch at star of siam intstead, and hoped that we would be able to get in later that night.  by the time we parked the car it was 3.  we got to star of siam and ate a lot of food.

took the train to logan square and got to the venue by 5:30pm to see animal collective.  the opener sucked, some guy named Brendan?...spoken word to programmed beats.  not good at all.  but animal collective was awesome.  amy muscled her way to the front, so we were right at the stage.  it was a lot of fun to watch them.  amy wanted to come back and see them again at the late show, but remaining tickets wouldn't go on sale until doors opened at 9:30p.  we still wanted to go to berghoff though.  we decided we would try to do both and hope for the best.

we got out of the show at 8pm, took the train back to downtown with all the hipsters, who all disembarked at Washington to catch their red line back north, we continued on to Jackson and walked 3 blocks up to Berghoff.  the line was quite a bit shorter at that point.  we got in line at 8:30, managed to get seated by 9:15pm, right before they cut off the line for the night.  again we ate a lot of food.  we were happy we had a chance to eat at Berghoff one last time before they close on Tuesday.

we got back to the car, pulled out of the parking garage, got a little turned around and found ourselves at lake shore instead of heading toward 90/94.  turned around and took a bit of a detour through a hopping gold coast night.  EVENTUALLY...we managed to get going east on Division and picked up the expressway.  made it back to Logan Sq. Auditorium at 11pm.  Animal Collective had just started their late show set, and they released two more tickets right about when we got to the door.  we got in and were able to enjoy another animal collective set, which was awesome.  admittedly, it was more or less the same set from earlier, with a few extra songs added.  but, we enjoyed it from afar this time...and were able to fully appreciate/hear the vocals this time.

it was 1am before we got back on the road, tired and with full bellies.  the drive home was arduous, but the day and the trip had been worth it.  everything worked out quite well, and it was a lot of fun."

You are THE ZOMBIE-KILLER.
While others are digging latrines, giving orders or<br>hiding, you're the one out there giving the<br>undead a fatal headache. Aggressive and brave<br>to the point of foolhardiness, you never think<br>twice about killing because that's what you do<br>best.
Typical skills: Marksmanship, melee weapons.
In your free time you: Train hard.
Chances of survival: High (though you have a<br>dangerous job you're a professional zombie<br>fighter).

"event","<I>Rapid, significant swelling usually indicates severe damage has taken place. The swelling is caused by bleeding of the damaged tissue and the resultant bruise or discolouration is a result of gravity pulling the blood downwards. So the swelling is often situated a small distance away from the actual damaged site.</I>

Thank you netdocotor.

the brusing from my internal bleeding has migrated all the way to my toes."

"event","so, my ankle looks really gross today.  no, seriously, it's disgusting.  it feels a lot better.  a little stiff, but it doesn't hurt as much to walk on it.  but over the course of last night the bruising has really matured.  the swelling has sort of leveled off by spreading around my entire ankle instead of just being localized above the ankle itself.  the whole area has a nice grayish bruising with some really awesome clumps of deep purple below and above the ankle bone.

my boss has insisted that i go see my doctor today.  i'm going at 4pm, but i'm guessing he won't tell me much i don't already know.  My boss is just worried because it looks so bad.  but it really does feel much better.

i'll update you all on what he tells me.

i'm kind of obsessed with looking at my ankle.  i kind of wish i could take a picture of it."

"event","so, i twisted my ankle yet again, but much more seriously this time.

not broken no.

but, pretty badly sprained.  i've iced and elevated and rested, but it's still pretty swollen and bruised, and at least for the time being i can't put any weight on it without rather intense pain.  my circulation seems good though, and i think the icing helped to keep swelling to a minimum.  currently i'm hoping everywhere on my right leg or wheeling my self around in my office chair.  if it's not much better in the next couple days, i may go to the doctor, just to make sure there's nothing seriously wrong.  i don't think there is, at least that rest and time won't help.  i don't think anything snapped (cross fingers), but when it happened it was quite exquisitely painful.

i may be sidelined for the next few days."

"event","I haven't posted in a while, and a lot has happened, but i'm impatient so i'll try to keep this quick and you can ask me for more details if you're interested:

-have been relaxing post-IDF Dinner, which went very well, and i got numerous compliments on the food, which i managed to deliver for just under my $150 budget, but there's still a lot to do, and although things will be less hectic, i will still probably be pretty busy with work until through the end of the year.

-went to Chicago Wednesday night, late, so i could show up at the National Guard Armory at North and Kedzie at 7am for the Winter Homeless Veterans Standdown.  it's usually a twice yearly event (longer one in summer, shorter one for winter) that's run by many vets groups, including my friends in Vietnam Veterans Against the War.  the events been troubled in recent years by the closing of the north and kedzie armory for asbestos removal and scheduling problems with the south-side armory (the summer standdown was cancelled this year).  Basically, all these vets groups get together to feed, clothe and provide social services to the many homeless vets who are in the west-side area of the city.  the summer standdown draws as many as 500 vets.  this year there were about 260 homeless vets who showed up for the winter one.  they were fed a breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage, toast, hash browns and juice or coffee.  they were given winter clothes, shoes, bedrolls, blankets, provided health services (including eye exams and free glasses), haircuts, and could speak with various social services agencies (everyone from IDES and the VA to more radical stuff like VVAW's veterans and GI counselor Ray Parrish).  I volunteer with VVAW which traditionally runs the dishwashing and cleaning stuff out of the kitchen.  people from VFW and American Legion usually do the cooking, and Vets Now (which feeds homeless vets on a smaller scale every Sunday of the year in Chicago) helps with serving.  Tonnes of other volunteers to help with the other stuff.  Definitely a widely divergent grouping of Vets groups, but they all get together for this event.  The homeless vets also got a lunch of hotdogs with trimming, baked beans and chips (gross, yes, but that's my opinion) and a packed meal to take with them...plus someone donated cakes this year.  we got done about 2:15pm, early, because the VFW and American Legion guys didn't show up trashed this year (as usual) and make a huge mess.  they were very neat, which made our job much easier.  WBEZ and Trib were there to cover it, as were many others.  I apparently saved the day by figuring out that the garbage disposal wasn't working because the breaker was off.  not that impressive no, but i think the VVAW guys like to talk me up quite a bit, so they'll always say that I ""kicked ass.""

-Thursday night, Amy and I went to the Ted Leo show at Metro, and we met up with other folks (jess, richie, andy, etc).  It was a lot of fun, despite some not so good openers.  but, omg, my legs were tired by the end after having stood up all day long.

-Friday, went to the VVAW Annual Veteran's Day Rally at the former location of the Veitnam Veterans Memorial (which Daly lost, not personally, but he's in charge, you know?) on the corner of Upper Wacker and Wabash (steet level).  VVAW has held this event there at the same time every Veteran's Day for over 20 years, they have a permit, but we found when we got there, that the city's dedication of the new memorial (River level) was still going on (it had started at 7am that morning) and it prevented the VVAW event from going on until a hour later.  There was lots of super-patriotic ego-stroking going on in the speeches and lots of rather questionable interpretations of the history of the Vietnam war, especially the alderman who was MC-ing the event (a member of the American Legion).  Some of the speeches were pretty sickening.  After noon when the city's event started to clear out, the anti-war vets contingent began it's yearly event.  Although it drew a few disapproving looks and comments from vets leaving the city event, many had good things to say, and although not many stuck around, many showed they approved when the realized the event was a vets event in opposition to the current war in Iraq.  a few of the cops that were around made big donations to VVAW.  my friend Barry MC-ed the event, there were two Iraq vets who spoke, an Indiana Vietnam War vet, Pat Vogel of Military Families Speak Out, Ray Parrish of VVAW and another Vet who served in Somalia and Haiti who spoke about recruiting of minorities, also Dr. David Gill spoke about health care, and specifically health benefits for Vets (which the Bush administration has been gutting in order to pay for the war).  I worked security for the event with my friends Jen and Kurt and Bill Branson of the VVAW, who runs the Standdown.  there was very little press to cover this event, even though just about all the press was there to cover the city event.  and of course, my friend Barry had to get in a few jabs at Daly for loosing the old memorial.

-I slept most of the rest of Friday, but

-went to Hungry Brain for drinks with Amy and Sabrina that night.  It was a pretty nice bar, with a great jukebox.  I got a little tipsy.

-Saturday, visited my Mom in Hoffman Estates, ate too much Korean food, and my mom bought me a bunch of stuff at the Asian market...mostly over-sized fruits that seem to be very popular with the Koreans.  I got to talk to my mom for a while, which hasn't happened in a really long time.  I asked her a bunch of questions about my family over in Korea, and she was very uncharacteristically forthcoming with information.  I found out a bunch of stuff that I didn't know about my family over there.  such as, of my mom's 6 brothers and sisters, three of them are 1/2 siblings, because my grandfather slept around a lot in his younger days (which was apparently common in old korea) and he brought home 2 kids from one woman and 1 kid from another woman for my grandmother to raise along with her own children.  also, that my grandmother was so upset by my grandfather's behavior that she once considered killing herself by throwing herself in front of a train.  my grandparents are broke but refuse to leave the home they've lived in for well over 30 years to move into an apartment that their kids could afford to pay for.  my grandfather's been in the hospital a lot for heart problems, and he has Alzheimer's.  my mom thinks he's probably going to die soon.  Plus i have two cousins that i didn't know about.  they are the kids of my mom's other younger brother (real brother), who still lives in Korea.  my mom and her sister, who lives in the U.S. and works at the same casino that she does, are not currently speaking.  they've had a falling out over family stuff with my grandparents, and other things.  my mom would like to go visit Korea sometime, but doesn't think she'll be able to.  now i feel like i really need to learn Korean and try to make my way over there sometime soon.

-I came home Saturday night to catch up on chores and work, and to make it to a prairie burn on Sunday morning.  unfortunately the burn was cancelled due to high winds.

Okay, that was a lot longer than i thought it would be.

A very good, fun weekend.  I got to see lots of wonderful people.  And i got to miss work on thursday."

      <FONT size=-2>This test measured 3 variables. </FONT><P>
<FONT color=red>First, this test measured how <B>organized</B> you are.  Some muppets like Cookie Monster make big messes, while others like Bert are quite anal about things being clean. </FONT><P>
<FONT color=blue>Second, this test measured if you prefer a <B>concrete</B> or an <B>abstract</B> viewpoint.  For the purposes of this test, concrete people are considered to gravitate more to <I> mathematical and logical approaches</I>, whereas abstract people are more the <I> dreamers and artistic type.</I></FONT><P>
<FONT color=green>Third, this test measured if you are more of an <B>introvert</B> or an <B>extrovert.</B>  By definition, an introvert concentrates more on herself and an extrovert focuses more on others.  In this test an introvert was somebody that either tends to spend more time alone or thinks more about herself. </FONT><P>
You are <B>very</B> organized, <B>both </B>concrete and abstract, and <B>more </B>introverted.<P>

Here is why are you Bert.<P>
<FONT color=purple>You are both very organized.  You almost always know where your belongings are and you prefer things neat.  You may even enjoy cleaning and find it therapeutic.  Bert is a big neat freak and gets quite annoyed when Ernie makes a big mess.<BR><BR>
You both are sometimes concrete and sometimes abstract thinkers.  Bert is probably a bit more concrete in his bottlecap collecting addiction and his love of the weather.  He does show his abstract side when he sings and performs his ""Doin' The Pidgeon"" song.  You have a good balance in your life.  You know when to be logical at times, but you also aren't afraid to explore your dreams and desires... within limits of course.<BR><BR>
You are both introverted.  Bert can be grumpy and doesn't get along well with most other folks.  Often he gets frustrated by their ignorance.  For whatever reason you are uncomfortable in social settings.  You may have one or two people that you are close with.  You'd rather do things by yourself and you dislike working in groups where things are always so inefficient.</FONT><P><P>

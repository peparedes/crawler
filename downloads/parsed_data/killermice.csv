"event","I am the paragon of self control.  Not only did I refrain from committing entertaining experiments on that interrupting, arrogant wretch of a wench, but I've also refrained from complaining about her.  Yes, she's a lovely insane sort of human, and I'm quite certain my old friend gets a good deal of satisfaction from her.  But if she doesn't learn to stay out of my way, there will be Words had.  And no, I am not jealous of her.  That line of thought is quite idiotic, and is not to be tolerated.  Besides, if I was...well, she wouldn't be walking around, would she?

In other news, I had a very merry Christmas - it is so much fun to play with my toys!  And the best part?  My best present is the gift that just keeps on giving.  Though I suppose I should stop playing with it a while and get back to the repair-work.  I would very much like to leave if I had to.  Bleh.  I'd rather keep playing and learning.  Maybe I can con my old friend into lending his ever-so-capable assistance; it would keep his mind off of whatever is annoying him.  For all of five minutes, at the very least."

"event","If it hadn't happened, I wouldn't have believed it.  The impossible happened while I was shopping for repair parts - I met another survivor!  Yes, I'm not alone anymore!  

I had been so afraid that I would never find him (or anyone), and then he just <I>showed up</I>.  While I was having a tea-break, one of the few things this benighted planet can do absolutely perfectly, he just....joined me.  My very oldest friend.  

Poor him, he's been stuck on this planet too long.  But he does have quite a few resources and minions to make up for it.  And he's giving me presents too, besides his very existance.  He always did know the way to my heart - give me laboratories to run free in, and a fascinating subject to play with and study.  Oh, and his help repairing my TARDIS too, but that was a given.

Which is why I'm here at the console, messing with this journal again.  See, I've a few things to do before I can go play with my presents.  Set the isomorphic controls for one - I'll not have him developing a kleptomaniacal streak and running off with <I>my TARDIS</I>.  Which he might do, if things get bad.  But hopefully they won't, which means he's stuck with me.  *grin*

The second thing?  Oh, right - I've borrowed some of his minions and some heavy machinery to move my TARDIS to his grounds.  The travel time from here to there is atrocious, and I don't want to waste a minute playing with my new toys.  Why the machinery?  I don't want to stress my old girl any more than I absolutely have to - she's in sad shape right now.  But that's going to change, yes it is.

All right, enough over-excited babbling to this odd form of diary-keeping.  Time to go and move my old girl.  Bye for now."

"event","All right, that's enough staring blankly at the manual and hoping for inspiration.  Time for me to get out and make my second attempt at finding something that will pass as second-rate repair parts.

Probably be easier if I carried a few instruments with me.  Which would be easier if I had <I>pockets</I>, demmit.  This calls for an expedition into the wardrobe.  And I don't care if women don't wear ankle-length coats here, it looks good and it has a horde of pockets.  Horde?  Flock?  Gaggle?  How does one refer to a multitude of pockets, anyway?

Right, enough of being idiotic through loneliness.  Off to find parts.  And maybe sample some of the ready-made food.

Wish me luck!"

"event","I'm back in the comfort of my own TARDIS now.  I'm just glad I'd remembered that humans like gold and will trade it for the paper they call money, or I'd have had a much less enjoyable time of my impromptu shopping trip.  

So, I got food.  Chocolate and tea, and random other things that caught my fancy or looked good.  Or made me laugh - humans are the only beings in the universe that would name a citrus fruit <I>satsuma</I>.  Saaaatsuma.  Sat<I>suuuuuma</I>.  It still makes me giggle, and now I have a bag full of them to cheer me up.  Because the food quest was the only successful part of the evening - I completely failed at finding anything I could mold and cozen into being proper repair parts.  Perhaps I'll have better luck tomorrow.

~~~later~~~

I'm in the console room now, lying on the floor under a holographic reproduction of the starscape about Earth.  It's relaxing, as is the gentle waterfall of notes from some random harp piece that I don't even remember the origin of.    

Tomorrow is another day, and sooner or later I'll be able to get on with the hunt for survivors.  I know there's at least one out there, I can feel it.

Because I don't know what I'll do if my head is just playing tricks on me.  If I'm the only one left, what will keep me going?"

"event","The Rani took one last look at the settings on the console, atavistically crossed her fingers for luck, and touched three buttons in sequence.  Grinning as the readings began pouring in on the screen, she spun a dial and shifted two levers, sending her TARDIS into the newly-formed rip in the fabric of two universes she had just made.  The trip was wretchedly rough, falling from one universe into the turbulence of the Void, and she held desperately to the console as she trusted to her TARDIS to find the right rip to slip into.

Eventually the terrible shaking ceased, and she wobbled to her feet to once again stand before the screen.  She frowned and chewed on her bottom lip as the readings continued to pour in.  It couldn't be right, what she was seeing...could it?  Could this be the right universe, without Gallifrey?  What had happened while she had been gone?  Drawn from her quandary by a repetitive beeping, she stared blankly at the indicators a minute before moving to the controls she had dedicated to opening and closing the rift.  Three flicks of a finger flipped three switches to a downward direction, and the TARDIS shuddered under her feet as nearly all the energy remaining to it was directed into closing the neat little tear in the fabric of the universe.  

Duty done, and still not believing the previous readings, she once again activated the scanners, searching always and only for any sign of what had once been home."

"event","Well i know i haven't updated in a long time.. just been busy i guess..

Let's see.. I've been spendin alot of time with Jeremy :) I seriously dont know how im gonna go 2 weeks without seein him :-( I'm gonna go crazy, i mean there hasn't been a day in a long time that i haven't seen him all day.. To tell you the truth, i cant remember the last time that happened.. We talked about him going to college the other day.. It was kinda emotional on my part, it really is gonna be different next year with him not being there after every class.. I dunno i guess thats just one of the things i will have to get used to.. I'm glad he is going to sandhills the first year, at least he will still be in town, but at the same town i dont want to hold him back from livin his life in college either.. :-\ I guess thats why i love spendin every minute i can with him, cuz its makin up for the time we wont see eachother..ehh I think he got kinda.. i dunno the words, but he just had this look..hmm.. cant describe it.. when he heard from april why i love spendin so much time with him.. cuz i know there will be times i wont be able to see him, and im just makin memories for those times, and how much i love just being next to him.. hmm.. i wish he never had to leave my house..

Yea, now that i just spilled my love for jeremy up there.. i had to work yesterday, and i hated it so bad going in there.. but after i got my check.. hmm.. im thinkin its not half bad any more. lol it was more than i expected so i think i will stay a lil longer..hmm.. i hate the outfits tho.. oh well.. now i can pay when me and jeremy go out, instead of him always payin, cuz he NEVER lets me pay for anything, even when he's broke! lol aww he's soo cute..

April stayed over last night.. it was ok.. except for the fact when she kissed jeremy on the cheek.. now, that wasnt straight at all, in fact it highly pissed me off.. grrr but besides that we just sat around and listened to my big n rich cd.. lol i got her lovin some country! lol i think thats great haha.. oh well

I dont know what im gona do.. if jeremy goes out with the crew today, i will probably just lay out.. oh well thats what i think im bout to do .. i will update this thing later.. love ya'll!

"event","ok.. so last night was so great! Jeremy, dana, craig, and me went to the jessica simpson/ Ryan Cabrera concert.. wow.. ryans not half bad ;-) nah but so after ryan came on stage he said that he will be handing out 300 signed cds so dana and i joined the mob of people rushing to get the cd! on the way danas foot got jammed into the pavement, her pants were falling, and she dropped/lost her cell phone! so we get up to the line, and at first they woulnt let us go up, cuz there was to many people.. but then they desided too.. so were in line, right.. and were calling danas cell to see if anyone had picked it up.. no one answered! so we finally get up to ryan and he hands me a cd! i get a hug and he says to me ""we were so close!"" wow words i will never forget lol..we walk back soo proud of our accomplishments and looking for danas cell.. no luck.. we get a pretzle.. dana has dandruff, that needs medical attention!haha.. during the concert.. dana calls her cell, and an old woman picks up saying she has the cell.. so we set out to find it.. but in the process are going the completely the wrong direction! haha wow.. so we get some event staff guy to help.. and he doesnt know where he's going either! but in the end.. we got it..we went back to the concert and finish making fun of the spaz on stage..(salt peppA oregano and silent bob) --ya had to be there.. we parked at the gate so we got in real easy and out real easy.. jeremy stayed here last night.. and found out just how cold my house gets.. especially when craig comes in and takes blankets off you!! haha things ended up great in the end.. i got home around 12, and went to bed around 2ish.. got a kiss good night.. and woke up to jeremy's smilin face in mah kitchen this morning.. it was great.. well this thing is gettin real long, and i need to find something to do today.. i might go to KC blackmons softball game tonight.. who knows.. will write in this thing later.. peace"

"event","Well last night totally sucked.. after i dropped off my brother and his friend at a pool party.. i backed my moms friends car into another car that was creepin into the spot next to me.. it was just one of those feeling you cant explain.. so i got out.. and the old woman (who was clearly intoxicated or on some pills or something) starts bitchin at me.. and i just looked at her, and said.. ya know what i dont need that right now.. and just sat on the bumper of my car.. craig and david tried calming me down the whole time.. but wow.. that didnt work.. When that police man pulled up.. oh hell .. i lost it.. i dont like police men for some reason.. :-\ i was shakin so bad i couldnt talk, and craig had to answer all the questions the police man asked me for me... so yea.. i have to pay for all the damages to the accord (bitchy womans car) but it shouldnt be too much, they just have to pop out the side of her car.. ugh.. i guess thats where all my paychecks are going for a while.. but when jeremy and my parents showed up i felt so much better.. i have the greatest family, and bestest boyfriend.. they calmed me down, and reashured me that my insurance wont go up or anything.. whew.. i definately wouldnt have been gettin a car any time soon.. ughh.. oh well im not driving any more.. i just dont want to.. :-\ Tonight should be fun.. me and jeremy and dana and craig are going to the jessica simpson concert! haha wow were gonna make fun of her the whole time.. ahha she is such a spazzz haha i dont know what im doing today.. prolly something with daddy.. oh well.. im bout to go give him his present.. i might update this thing later.. peace"

At least now i actually have free nights and weekends and stuff that can actually do any good! well, i need to go get ready, Jeremy's coming over soon!! YAY! i will write in this thing later..

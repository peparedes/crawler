"event","This is going back to when I was 1 til about 5... Long time ago, lol.
I remember running around at somebodie's house with my Dad and all his buddies there... Tony, Bottz (what a name, lol), Dad, Chad, etc etc and they'd all be drinking and listening to the ""Tragically Hip"" and laughing and I'd be right in the middle, lol.
Every memorie I have of that place I was laughing somehow. At something. Not old enuff to understand most of what was going on but those guys would play for me for hours... Especially Tony, omg. Me and Dad still sit back and laugh how I was his little princess and he'd take me everywhere. Everybodie's like is that yur kid Bonehead and he's like nah, it's Bob's but isn't she adorable, I love her, lol...
I shouldda been a boy I swear, I got a million guy friends, I got that funkie dress stylin with the backwards hatz and baggy jeanz like a dude, I sit like one, I'm totally low key with my hair and makeup, lol... Kraziness.
I remember running around on my big wheel which at the time was like the greatest invention on earth and them chasing me down the street, taking turnz making sure I don't go flying out onto the road, howling at me when they're yelling to stop and I just go faster, lol, oh man I miss the old days...
I still listen to the Hip every chance I get, especially their 1992 Fully Completely cd which is my fav, lol, gotta buy it I know... I miss those guys, so much shit has happened to them over the yearz. My Dad and Bottz fell outta touch after my Dad admitted to him that his wife was sleeping with everything in town which was true but you dun wanna hear it from yur best buddie I suppose, Tony died on a drug overdose of coke which made me cry til my eyes almost fell out when I was 10, I still miss that bastard and wish he was here, he was insane but I loved him to death, I wish he couldda stayed til I was at least 20 so I couldda sat down and told him all the great memories he gave me... Maybe somewhere he'll read this.
Everybodie else really just scattered from what I've heard, a bunch are hardcore druggiez now so Dad keeps his distance and a couple died like Bonehead (what a nickname, don't ask, lol), so I guess at least we got memories of it... That's the good thing."

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">One of my favorite setz of
memoriez when I was a kid... Our trailer, lol, I guess I got some
country in me too or how Mike writez it ""cuntree"", lol. It wasn't like
these American thingiez though, I was like wtf was that when I seen it,
lol. Copetown was just a place everybodie went up to on weekends to
partie. It was amazing.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I'd spend my week at skool or
wherever I was wishing I was there and holding onto Friday afternoon
when I'd jet out there with Dad. Just me and Dad most of the time,
sometimes he'd bring his latest fling, lol. We'd drive out 50 mins to
the country (or what used to be out there for us... now it's houses,
lol) and everytime I seen it I'd know I was home again. Get there
around 5pm Friday and fire up our bbq and stay til like 9pm Sunday
night 'cause we both didn't wanna come home to the citie.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">My bike was up there and man I'd
take off on that thing and just cruise. I could cover that whole place
that was acres big in a good hour on that thing. Sprayed pink 'cause it
was actually a guyz bike and I'd bust that thing up every time, lol. It
was all gravel down the big hill to our place and I'd take that thing
at full speed down and almost kill myself stopping but I'd giggle as it
all sprayed and my Dad just shook his head and laughed back at me.
Someone stole it before the shut the place down when I was 10, the
bastardz.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I must have spent every weekend up
there from when I was 6 til I was 10 whenever I could. Whatever
happened that week just didn't matter 'cause I was up in Copetown and
I'd have such a blast. Me and a bunch of kidz would take over and go
wherever we wanted 'cause we knew everybodie. Only one dude could keep
up though, he was such a cutie back then, lol. My first crush that guy,
we were together all the time just hanging out. He pushed me into the
lake a million times and I threw him in about a trillion, lol, we were
always in trouble together but everyone always let us off laughing,
lol. I got him once though, it was my b-day and I think I was 9 and
there was a big partie going down up there and he asked me to dance.
Man, I think I must have blushed my head off and just about sunk into a
huge hole as everyone around us cracked up saying we were ""sooo cute"",
lol. I haven't seen him in a good 9-10 years but I always smile when I
think about old times, I hope he does too.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">The best night up there by far...
I was 8 and it was July 1st, Canada Day! Everybodie had fireworks and
they were going off over the lake and you could see them from all over
the park and it was gorgeous but Dad had forgotten it was and of course
made me all sad, lol. So to make up, half drunk but I never laughed so
hard in my life, we started up our bonfire and then he smirks and goes
hold on... Oh man, I never imagined this, lol. He grabs different cans
that will explode and then grabs an empty propane tank from our grill
that has just enuff to explode of course, we toss the small ones in and
smirk and watch the explosion and then we send in a bunch of them and
that propane tank, lol. All I heard as he threw it was ""RUN SAM RUN!!""
I took off at high speed and baby that thing exploded so damn high we
were told we had the best damn fireworks display ever, what the hell
did we use... lol. We never told of course 'cause we'd get in major
shit but that was such an awesome night, I'll remember it for the rest
of my life baby, lol.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I still sit back and wish it was
there so I could go escape. I know my Dad does too. I still love fires
and nothing is more calming to me then one, that smell of it and the
looks, brings me back to years ago when things were just a touch
simpler. Brings me back to up there with everyone always laughing and
joking (course everyone was always drunk but I didn't know that!
lol...) and made me realize that I could deal with whatever came at me
as long as I could escape and spend at least a couple days up there. I
used to stare into that lake and wonder what life would be like and
think through everything and I never came up with my life now but it
was so beautiful...</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I miss it so much...</span><br>"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">So everyone wanted to know the
historie of Sami, skarie thought. I made this journal for it
specifically and I'll add it to my friends list on my other one so you
can get directly to it without having to know the url. I'm still a bit
worried about opening up so much online but what can people do, read it
and try and come find me, I doubt they would in a city of half a mil,
lol. Well here we go I guess...</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I don't remember this but I've
been told the storie by many different people many different times and
I have pictures and the scars on my face to make it true. I was a year
and a half, my parents decided to go to New Brunswick (where they're
both originally from) to visit my Dad's grandparents. I was born when
he was 22 and my Mom was 31. 2 of my uncles on my Dad's side decided to
come with us. My great-grandpa had a huge German Shepherd that he used
to take hunting with him. We were having a picnic in the backyard and
my Grandpa was playing with me and I guess the dog got jealous because
there was no other reason for what happened... I tottled off and went
to play in the grass with my ball about 30-40 feet away and the dog
jumped in my face and bit me. I started screaming and my Dad and uncles
ran over and Dad grabbed me while they grabbed the dog and he threw me
at my Grandpa while everyone freaked 'cause I was bleeding
everywhere... Beautiful.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">My Dad grabbed the only thing
within reach which happened to be a beer bottle someone was drinking
from earlier and slammed it down across the dogs head as hard as he
could, lol. It's not funnie but it's so classic of New Brunswickerz as
well all call them, lol, you don't think you just grab and take out
whatever hurt your baby or yourself or whatever. The dog was out, he
didn't kill it with the shot but it was pretty much there... They
rushed me to the hosp while my grandparents stayed behind and cleaned
up my face. It wasn't as bad as they originally thought, I wasn't
missing a piece of my face or anything thankfully, he had dug his teeth
in and then they caught him before he close the bite and rip out my
flesh (man that sounds so delicious... lol...) so they treated it and
said I'd have scars but not any severe damage so I could go home.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">When we got home the dog was dead.
My great-Grandpa shot it after we left so nobodie had to see that go
down 'cause he could no longer trust it wouldn't turn on anyone else. I
still feel bad, that was my Grandpa's bestfriend for years and it ended
with that. 17 and a half years later I still have the scars though. The
doctors said they thought they'd go away but they never have. There's
one underneath my chin that you can't see unless I lift my face,
they've also faded a touch with time but never completely gone, and
then there's one over my top lip underneath my nose where his top teeth
dug into that I hide with a lot of makeup, lol.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I'm still terrified of big dogs to
this day, for other reasons that'll prolly come out later in my entries
too but that has a lot to do with it. I go to someone's house with one
and I stand outside, lol, I guess I have good reason but I feel like an
ass, oh well...</span><br>"

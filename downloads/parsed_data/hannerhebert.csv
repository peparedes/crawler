"event","So I'm deleting this journal. Let's start with that.

I reread it last night, while I was thinking. It's got everything from about the time Gabe and I started dating in it, so it stretches back quite a ways.

It's nice to know I continue to repeat the same mistakes.

So I'm deleting it, and hopefully letting it all go. Fresh air would be nice.

My other journal is staying though, so Katherine, you'll still have to deal with my emo poetry from time to time.

Umm.

Thanks."

"event","Ok, look. When it comes to my body, I'm not particularly sensitive, but there is one subject that you can reduce me to tears pretty quickly if you bring up. You can go ahead and laugh, and tell me my hair's too frizzy, my butt's too big, my left eye's a bit lazy, my ear's stick out, my nail's are short, and my chest's too small. But if you bring up the fact that my skin is just down right awful, I snap. 

My dad, who has all the tact of a Reese's monkey, proclaimed very loudly today that my skin is bad and that I could be a really pretty girl if I took care of it, but right now I'm just well... 

So I snapped back, and now they're angry with me. And I now have to go see a doctor about it??? Fuck no. It'll go away on its own damn time. Just leave me be!!!!

&lt;/end rant&gt;

Umm... other than that, life is uneventful. I'm babysitting on Thursdays and have my work cut out for me this summer, both at work and at karate (apparently I'm testing at the beginning of next month. Not quite sure why, but he told me I would today. Hmm.)

Plans for this month include Sturbridge with Mrs. Sylvester and her boys (Aiden, who's 10, Patrick, who's 7, and Liam, who's 4), babysitting Damien, working at BEC, a trip to Long Island (NEXT WEEKEND!!!!), a dentist appointment, and possibly driving to the ocean. And maybe a new car. I don't know.

Umm...That's it. There's other stuff, but I really don't want to talk about it, so I won't. So....END."

"event","For some reason, I had tickets to go see the circus. The circus was in Ronkonkoma, and in order to get there, I had to take a train. Matty and Justine decided not to go, so I walked down the Hempstead Turnpike, and took a left onto a street that looked suspiciously like Route 44 in Greenville to get to the train station, which looked like Grand Central, and then was suddenly on the train. I was carrying my big blue pep band duffel bag (I kept hitting people with it) and I didn't have a ticket, so I had to keep dodging the conductors by moving up cars. The train itself was red and old fasioned, with a black interior and seats like the ghetto trains here have. There were also these balcony seats outside the windows. 

At the rear of the train, I ran into a man who looked like my dad and his young son whose name was Daniel. The kid was about three or four years old and had the same silly mushroom cut my brother had when he was little. He kept running away from his dad, who kept yelling at him. I talked to the man about my brother and then counted the stops to Ronkonkoma, because the speaker system was fuzzy. The train was making stops, but no one seemed to be getting off, and then it suddenly stopped and EVERYONE was in front of the door and I managed to sneak outside without the conductors ticketing me.

Then I was outside of the circus, which was in this big silver building with no doors and a low cut hedge maze (but for some reason you couldn't step on the hedges. Don't remember why- but it was low cut enough you could see through it.) A man with a swipe card appeared inside the maze and the father-figure (minus the kid) and I were about half way through it when Matty called and scared me into reality."

I told him to keep the kid, but he owes me dinner.) I'm picking up Cam's shift next Friday night....sooooo craziness. I'll be rich. :D

Started packing today. The majority of my desk is in boxes, along with all of my dresses and coats from my closet and everything on my walls. Hannah was shocked when she got back and saw I took down all the posters and pictures. The walls look entirely too bare. When I get off my shift, I'm going to tackle the stuff on the wall by my desk and maybe some of my clothes if I'm feeling ambitious. I don't go home until a week from tomorrow, but I want to be able to devote all of next week to school and hanging out with friends. I really don't want to worry about packing then.

I have to do laundry today, but that should be the last time I do it before I go home. I had to pick up detergent which sucked, because I'm going to go home with an almost full bottle of All. No dryer sheets at Dutch though... oh well. 

Played Manhunt last night! Got dragged around Calkins Quad at 2am kicking and screaming towards the jail. All in all, a good time.

It was brought up as a possibility because of the whole ""we have to re-wire the whole house"" deally,&nbsp; but this has actually made me stop and think about it as a viable option. There are other reasons too, but I always had something keeping me here. Don't get me wrong, I <i>hate</i> URI.

Then at 10:30 he came downstairs and watched a movie. It's not fair to him though- he's not exactly the social type, and I feel ridiculous imposing on him all the fucking time. But he's it. That's it.<br /><br />Fuck, I'm as alone as when I started.<br /><br />Ryan didn't help matters either, but we discussed it. Needless to say, I was alone.

Justine and I were both collections of boys clothes from upstairs. I wore Rafal's tux pants and jacket and Steve's shoes, socks, shirt, vest, bow tie, and cuff links. It took a couple of tries to get it all right- Steve's pants didn't fit me and I ended up having to ask around for another pair of pants. I also had to bind my chest which meant I couldn't <i>breathe</i> and Matt ripped on me from going from a C to nothing.<br /><br />Justine looked like a trucker. She also did a random collection from the boys upstairs and ended up wearing Nick's pants and hat, Mike's wife-beater, Adam's belt, Kevin's boxers, Steve's shoes, and Cam's Ninja turtle's hoodie. She, all in all, looked hilarious. We rolled up a paper joint for her and then had to teach her how to properly hold a cigarette. Matt kissed her on the cheek and left a huge lip print, and that was pretty sweet too.<br /><br />And Matt! Matt wore my green skirt and white halter top and Justine's wedge heels. He also wore a flower in his hair and shit loads of make up. He ended up looking like a pregnant hula dancer with really short hair. It was great. :D<br /><br />Cam came upstairs to see us off and nearly dropped his sax when Matty opened the door. Oh dear....<br /><br /><br />The show itself was amazing. The MC's were hilarious and there were a few really funny acts including renditions of ""Holla back girl,"" ""Dick in a box,"" and ""I need a hero,"" as well as a funny dancing cop. The people on stage definitly had fun with it and it meant the audience did too.<br /><br />Umm... in other news, I've been following baseball. Err... it has a lot to do with hanging out with Cam because he's really into it, so I've been learning. He was disappointed the Yanks lost not once, not twice, but<i> three times </i>to the Sox last week. :D<br /><br />I've got a project due in psycholinguistics on Thursday, and <strike>I'm debating skipping Japanese today</strike> I am skipping Japanese today.

"event","It's so cold today. It's raining very hard and the wind is blowing and I don't have a raincoat. The walk to Netherlands and then to the student center after work means that I am thoroughly drenched. At least two of my three classes today are in the same building.

Justine and I are thinking about getting a house our junior year! She's living in Twin Oaks next year (there's a pretty good chance I will be too, actually) and then... well, we'll figure it out. I personally like the idea, cause it would mean not having to go back to RI over the summer. So even if the house idea falls through, I'll prolly get an apartment. :D

Umm... it's cold, but I've said that already. People have the door in the Student Center propped open, and the wind is blowing in. I wish they'd close it. 

I got a job RSRing yesterday, and I've just come off my second shift. It wasn't that bad- Netherlands tends to double RSR, so there was this Turkish grad student sitting with me. He was pretty cool. :)

Yesterday I covered for Jets fan. I was a bit annoyed about it- I was under the impression that he was going to sleep or something because he was up almost as late as I was the other night, but he went to the beach instead. -_-; I don't know. Whatever. This was one of the reasons I wanted to leave BEC. I never actually had any of my own time off- I always ended up covering peoples shifts for the dumbest reasons.

Oh well. I told him he owes me. He'll never end up covering any of my shifts. I've got a 4-8am one, two 8-10am, and a 12-4pm on Saturday. 

On the bright side, Dynamic pride was last night! It was amazing! Sang ""Can you feel the love tonight?""! Jill and I sang alto! The third alto had no idea what she was doing! Hahaha

The boys all bitched because we wanted to see Blades of Glory, but enjoyed it in the end. Beth went home with Lea, I dropped off Mike and then talked with Gabe.<br /><br />It was....enlightening. And needed- for both of us. He spent half the ride holding onto my sweatshirt like I was going to vanish into thin air again. We talked about a lot of things and worked out a few of our issues. And well,<br /><br />It looks like I have a friend in him again.<br /><br />And that's nice.

I have this one girl in ALL THREE OF MY SPEECH CLASSES who, despite detailed explanations in ALL THREE CLASSES, continues to ask questions about them.<br /><br />Well, I've got news for you darling. They're easy. Second graders know how to deal with them. You are a senior in college. You should not be dumber than a box of rocks. Look, I'll explain it again. You take a word, and you find the base word, such as book or speak, and then you count that and the number of prefixes and suffixes you had to take off in order to get to that word.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Books = Book/s = 2 Morphemes.<br />Cheddar= Cheddar = 1 Morpheme.<br />Unspeakably = Un/speak/abl/y = 4 Morphemes.<br /><br />Please either get the point or drop the fucking class. All three of them. <br /><br />In other news, I had possibly the most awkward conversation in the HISTORY of awkward conversations with my father- I asked him if it was ok if I went on birth control.<br /><br />Now, regardless of the answer to this question, I fully intend to. I just like to have parental approval on these things.<br /><br />After asking me about my sex life (::cringes::. I had to admit about Gabe. Awkward. <i>Feels like the first time....</i>) his response was along the lines of, ""It's fine by me, but ask your mother.""<br /><br />Ask my <i>mom?<br /><br />MY <b>MOM????<br /><br /></b></i>Do I look like I have a death wish?<br /><br />Honestly."

"event","So last night was amazingly random. My friend Fred from pubic safety called up Justine and asked if she wanted to go on a late night coffee run. She said sure and called me. So, we met Fred in front of Estabrook right around nine and decided to go to the Colony Diner. So we went, and ate (go never ending salads? what WAS that?), and when we were done, Fred started bitching about how diners here aren't as good as Jersey diners. Then he stopped, looked at us, and said, ""What are you darlings doing tonight?""


""Nothing....""


""ROAD TRIP!""


And so it began.

We headed down the Cross Island and the Grand Central (where I voiced my amazement at being able to avoid the LIE, which is the devil incarnate. No joke.) As we crossed the Throgsneck bridge, I pointed out where 95 splits from 495, which is the way we go to head back to Rhode Island. :) Then we went over the upper George Washington so we could see the city at night and then we were in New Jersey.

First we drove to Fred's house, so he could pick up his credit card and phone bill. We woke his mom up and played with his three dogs. When we got back in the car, he pointed out that we'd already had diner food and suggested we go to the grease trucks (which apparently make the best sandwiches in America). Which, by the way, are down by Rutgers, in New Brunswick. 

That's by Philadelphia if you didn't know.

So there we went. There was a car fire by the exit we needed to get off (not like the engine on fire. Like the whole car was engulfed in 30ft. flames you could see from two miles down the highway type of fire.) So that was exciting.

We got down there, got those amazing sandwiches (which were amazing btw) and then Fred asked where we should go next. Justine jokingly suggested going to see the big tree in Rockafeller Center and Fred said ok! and we headed back north. The car fire was still present so we had to go through Newark.

Newark is terrifying. Its the city that gives New Jersey its reputation for being a pit. It's all factories and machinery and looks like the poster child for those ""Save the Earth"" campains.

We took the Lincoln tunnel onto Manhatten Island and then drove around for the better part of an hour looking for this damn tree before we finally found it. We parked illegally, ran up, looked at the tree, and then went back to the car. We took the midtown tunnel and soon were back at Hofstra.

AMAZING! 

Possibly the most random thing I'd ever done, but totally worth it. :) 

Road Trip #2 is going to be to Philly. MUAHAHAHA."

"event","Some of you know I have two journals, the other's a writing journal. The following is actually an entry from that journal, but I felt it belonged here too.<br /><br /><i>Written at 3am<br /><br />I can remember visiting my Grandmother's house when I was little. The permanent smell of baked bread and old photos, the mismatched patched furniture accented by folding TV trays and a stained, tan carpet. The walls covered with height charts and pictures, the clank of the old heater, and the rattle of the windows. The bedrooms holding all of their memories in ancient toys, covered in dust, still waiting anxiously impatient on shelves. Always a friendly, welcoming, place in an awkward sort of way- It's always been home but you never feel as if you can stay, like you're always just a visitor, you never belong.<br /><br /> I can't sleep. <br /><br /> These pinstriped sheets smell of dust, musty from disuse. The room aches, overflowing with memories of fantastic games, pop music, first love, and heartbreak. Even with the wallpaper stripped away to the harsh reality of the concrete beneath, traces of pink paint cling to the past.<br /><br /> My insomnia takes me downstairs, over tan, stained and worn carpets, past TV trays and worn sofas, into a kitchen smelling of baked bread from the night before.<br /><br /> I'm home now, but not really.<br /><br /> I'm just visiting Grandma's house.</i>"

"event","<font size=""7"">...</font><br /><br />I have never been so angry in my life that I've actually wanted to kill someone.<br /><br />Well, as of last night, I've had the experience. It's not pleasant.<br /><br />What I will say is that men who pull the sort of shit he did last night deserve to be killed. No exceptions. I don't want to hear that he had too much to drink or that he was just messing around. The fact of the matter is, my best friend, the girl I care about most in this world, is currently curled up in a ball, sound asleep, in my bed because she's too scared to walk back to her dorm. If fact, she was too scared to go get dinner this afternoon. <font size=""2"">I HAD TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE THIS SICK FUCK WASN'T IN THE BUILDING BEFORE SHE'D GO INTO KATE AND WILLY'S, <font size=""3"">WHERE HALF OF THE PUBLIC SAFTEY GUYS WERE GETTING READY FOR WORK.</font></font><br /><br />And even then, you could tell she was edgy.<br /><br />If I ever see this kid, there won't BE enough of him left to attend his summons.<br /><font size=""3""><br />Boy, you have been warned.</font>"

Ok so i was right. When i said there was down there there was a reason for it. shes checked andi have a long rip write down the middle of my stomach muscles the width of a finger which is causing my to be in agony. thats why it hurts more when i eat. Shes written a letter to the pct who hold the purse strings. she says they have no money but she wrote that i need the operation to fix my muscles and get rid of the skin or the problem is going to get worse. if i get a letter from a pschiatrist then i can definatly get it done. so i have to choices. wait for the pct or psychiatrist. either way the whole in my muscle is going to need an operation,which she thinks will swing the op in my favour. so i dont know weather to be happy or cry. because the pains in my stomach are going to get worse wiothout an op to fix my muscles."

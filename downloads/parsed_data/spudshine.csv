I also havent been reading ljs so I'm sorry about that too. Everything is pretty boring around here but its been really dificult with my parents splitting up and my dad moving out. I'm also working a lot and doing a lot of babysitting to help out my sister.

Ok so that paragraph was pretty much terribly dull. but yeah thats basically been my summer so far. I've done A LOT of reading including

The Other Boleyn Girl (Phillippa Gregory) --&gt; read this. it is very very good.
The Count of Monte Cristo (Alexandre Dumas)
HP &amp; the Sorcerers Stone (for like the 10th time)
Angels and Demons (Dan Brown)
The Sun Also Rises (Hemingway)
Every Boy Has One (Meg Cabot)

and a whole bunch of others. I love being able to go to the library near my house and get yummy good books instead of the scayr library at school that has only scary reference books. lol. Right now Im reading Domers by Kevin Coyne. Its about this journalist that spent a year at ND in 1992 and all of his experiences. It makes me proud to go to notre dame after like every page. Its also interesting to see how much ND has changed in 14 years. oooh and I saw POTC2 on friday. It was so much darker and gorier than the first one and not as funny. (Also Mr. Collins plays the bad guy........) but it wasnt too bad. I DO NOT like the whole elizabeth/jack/will triangle. I especially dont like how will saw her kissing jack and it hasnt been resolved yet. boooooo.&nbsp;"

"event","No, you arent going crazy... I really am LJing. Please refrain from dying of shock. So I dont have a whole lot to say. But like a long time ago I thought it would be really cool to write down those life lessons that you learn like randomly... you know like putting clear nail polish on a run in your panty-hose will stop it from getting bigger...&nbsp;

ok so i decided that when I think of them I am going to try to write them down in my LJ. so here's the story and the lesson from today.&nbsp;

so i skipped PE today because contemporary topics sucks and sleep is much more essential. So I got like 8 hours of sleep last night. When I woke up i was in this really chipper mood and decided i wanted to look pretty today. (I mean seriously... i have worn my fav. ND sweatshirt like every single day this week) So i did my hair and makeup and put on nice clothes and heels. 

Lesson #1: Pretty underwear and heels will make you feel sexy. Or just pretty underwear. even if no one can see it.

ok so I go to my exam (its so FREAKING COLD outside... what happened to the 50 degrees...?) which was... botchy. but hey you know... what can you expect? It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. So afterwards I go to South to get grab n go. As im walking up the steps from the basement my heel catches on a step and i lose my shoe. so just as i look back this gorgeous guy comes up. I was like WOAH. i think this may be my own personal fairy tale! I mean I didnt have random animals/vegetables turned into transportation but I am in a castle (sort of... i mean sdh does look like Hogwarts) i lost my shoe on the steps aaaand theres a gorgeous guy. I may not be Cinderella... but I never really liked that name anyways. Unfortunately as the irony of my fairy tale situation hit me the gorgy boy gave me (and my shoe) a weird look and walked away.&nbsp;So much for my contemporary fairy tale.

Lesson #2: high heels will NOT make you feel sexy if they make your toes turn blue from the frigidness of South Bend and/or if they get you weird looks from cute boys."

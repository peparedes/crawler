"event","there was once a girl. now many stories may have started like that in existence but this girl was unlike any of those other girls. she lived in a house made of grey stones that were magically laid on top of eachother with little support. she was young by all accounts by her nieghbours who saw her pace through her house only by the bright windows that were almost never covered by a heavy curtain. but to her illusive friends that were of many ages who came to visit monthly she had lived many lives. those who came were stopped by the nieghbours tending to the garden and asked of the character of this young girl who lived by herself while her garden seemed to always be pruned and her house seemingly perfect. these friends of hers told them of stories most elaborate them being quite elaborate themselves. but these stories were often repeated. because to as the public could tell she almost never left her house anymore. the nieghbour child asked one of the girl's friends about this obscure habit. the friend had said most expressively, ""well if you have seen the world already what left is there to see?"" the little child cried in his mother's arms as the way the guest had said it so.
 the wives of the street came to have a pleasant tea at mrs. jacob's house as one of the newly moved in wives (newly mrs. winters) asked so unattractively, ""who is that girl in the stone house, she seems quite unfriendly and almost a recluse."" mrs. jacob sipped her tea uncomfortably while the other women looked at the newly mrs. winters with uneasiness at her lack of discretion. ""she is Parker Fox, she is a recluse, but she is quite the wise one i hear and lovely."" mrs. jacob said putting down her dainty tea cup as if putting an end to the conversation. ""you hear? don't you know?"" mrs. winters pursued absolutely oblivious to mrs. jacob's tactics. mrs. camden said decidedly cool, ""no one knows anything about her, only she paces around her house, never in bad attire, and the walls of her house are dizzying and there is writing everywhere. she has an array of colourful friends and an array of colourful stories. but to her the world is black and white and she's stuck in the grey."" as this conversation went on in the house of the jacobs a hop over a fence, in the fox house, parker sat writing furiously on a type writer. it wrote as this. 

""I gave up you know. I believe at this very moment the wives of my neighbourhood are speaking of me again. I can hear their shrieky voices through the walls as if they were made of the finest muslin. a few years ago i was a splendid converser. it might seem a bit out of character but i was. but then i found out to my increasing dislike what conversation was. speaking had never become so tedious. a response. a question. the response to lead to a reason to be liked or disliked. and that could go on for months even years. even in marriages that lasts decades. has the human language become so mechanical? I can't even speak to new people without feeling so surgical, dissecting each sentence that comes sometimes so unskillfully out of ones mouth. drifting so far sometimes that it should seem sad but it isn't. both parties have lost the common ground they worked from. a friendship only becomes enforced after something happens between both that makes it easier to confess to and to comfort and to have a memory. my friends have said i have become a hermit, but i remember as a child playing with my nannies tarot cards and i pulled out the hermit card , a picture of an old man with a light in his hand. she told me in her fine gypsy way that the hermit wasn't one scared of the world. but knew so much of it already. that's why he held a light in his hand, or the wisdom of the world in his home reflecting. well the daily conversations of small talk i have gotten rid of, but it does make me curious to what the public does think of me and yes that is vanity but it is quite intriguing, so my dear friend say hello to father for me. yours etc."" 

she got up from her esteemed place and went to an untouched room hidden behind a cherry wood cabinet, took with her a balloon and attached the letter to it. she was exceedingly calm, and opened the window and said, ""to the strings that tie to you"" and let go of the babygirl-pink balloon. she sat on the floor after taking seperate photographs of her father and best friend from the dresser. she pulled both close to her heart. and smiled. ""because those strings never detach."""

"event","today. ohh today. one day to overcome then a new year again. the kind of excitement that causes you trouble breathing, the little kind that creeps up softly into your soul, that causes you to have hope.hope. even the word causes the feeling you find only in the eyes of the innocent and the sight of rainbows after the storm. 

we all are sensing that maybe this new unknown set of three hundred and sixty-five days holds more favourite moments than the past can ever amount to. 

a year i can promise holds many daydreams, but this year will be better. no more days of staring out of a window waiting, waiting for anything. a slight itch of happiness. a slight warmth of a tear. i already know it will be different. the life i know now will change again and again, we will become almost unrecognizable. but for this year i hold hope. hope and a blank agenda. 

have fun tonight.

"event","for now the words are blocked with unseen spectres as she tried to feel something. sadly what she felt was a strong rush of soft empathy. she lied on her bed in the morning incapable of getting up. a small tear had trouble falling from her cheek lonesome. because from that tear multiplied into a plethora of glistening salt water. they came and came till the world had to question her. ""Why are you crying silly girl?"" 
she sat up and was brought a porcelain tea cup that matched the faces of her friends, that broke with the same easiness. It had painted on pink orchids, that seemed to move and turn colours that the average would be blinded and confused if seen by them. She took a quiet sip, and looked back into the eyes of the world, frowned and blinked . Her eyes still flowing like the unknown volume of the seas. She said screaming at the top of her lungs, ""Why aren't you crying for our modern age?!"" The world sighed in response to her question. ""What do you want from the world, child from the end of a rainbow?""
She got up from her bed and stood on it, instead of being the mature young lady she was, she regressed before our eyes into a little girl. a younger version of herself in a dress of frill and frou with a dainty tiara placed on her head. a little girl with eyes too old to be real, a mind too young to be without superstitions, and a heart too wise to accept things at first glance. the old, young girl said with such a tone that made you feel immediate guilt, ""I want the world to stop having an empty capacity of smiles and love. because that's what the world needs is love."" The world smiled at the little idealist, ""the choice is to each their own. who will be their guide?"" the world found it amusing for such a character to feel such empathy, she felt as they did, she cried for them, and laughed and screamed. she said mystifying the world with her words, ""it's all the good that won't come out."" the room spiralled and distorted images not before it rained sparkling water inside the room and sweet flowers sprouted from the ground. 

she awoke opening her eyes, almost in relief it was all but a strange dream, caused most likely by spending her childhood watching alice in wonderland with fierce attention. she eyes felt dry, her throat warm, and her hands cold. she looked around her room wide eyed, there was a foot of still water that flooded her floor."

"event","I sat in the cafe today, it was the best time of the year. Tourists stayed at home buying presents for pretty, little girls who took ballet, and silly young boys who played every sport. I remembered those times of sunny days and perfect temperament. I swirled my flask filled with unmentionable toxins, as the memories came as quick. Now the mirror hanging slightly awry on the parisian blue walls reflected a harsh story of a girl. Her roots were grown in and her eyes were red with too many nights of long drags and too many days of mumbed reactions. Her face pale, the kind of pale found on sculptures worn with age. At that moment I found myself relating to them more than anyone else. I looked at them outside the cafe, now covered in a feathery layer of snow, made of stone, with the whole world watching us slowly crumble. The waiter came to serve me raspberry tea. ""Miss, your tea, are you expecting someone on this cold evening?"" I shrugged, ""Who knows darling, but thank you though."" The door opened and a gust of wind came freely causing a shiver to run through the patrons. Kaytlyn came striding through, ""I knew you would be here."" I laughed, kaytlyn eyed my monogrammed flask, ""Guess what I did,"" she took her hands out of her black wool jacket, with silk, plaid lining. She took a thimble off her right hand's thumb, it was a burn, the blood forming a perfect circle, she laughed. Kaytlyn was the kind of girl you passed by on the street and thought she was the sweetest girl. She had a pair of wide set eyes, that they had come to name rainbow eyes, as they changed from sunrise to set. You would hold that memory of first meeting her in your back pocket, for a sentimental cause mostly for yourself. To remind you again the world still had a fresh imprint of innocence in the eyes of this girl. Once she spoke you better had held on close, it faded as words came out of her mouth and drifted to the floor, like natural gravational force. ""Nadine is supposed to come by."" Nadine opened the door, where kaytlyn was standing in front of causeing her to move. Nadine...oh the stories she could tell you about everyone. She was the kind of girl you wanted to know. The kind of girl that was influential by nature. The kind you wanted, sometimes needed validation from. She intimidated the world, with hard stares, and smiles you needed to see to know your conversation was going well. After speaking with her you felt the need to tell someone about the relation you had with her, to put yourself closer to her level, the level she made up seamlessly through herself. That was how it was to anyone outside of her circle of friends.""Hey what are you doing here?"" Nadine asked surprisingly happy. ""Just thinking,"" I sighed, I couldn't enjoy my tea now. Though I was taught to enjoy my company as a first priority. Kaytlyn sat on the bistro chair in front of me, she picked up my flask and took a sip, than handed it to Nadine, ""And drinking, pretty damn strong."" Nadine took a sip unflinchingly, ""did you see Kaytie's burn?"" I nodded, ""What happened?"" Kaytlyn and Nadine looked at each other, and said almost synchronized, ""Well, she was smoking and the lighter burned the paper too quickly, and she held on to it too long."" ""Oh, Kaytie, get it checked okay?"" Kaytlyn rolled her eyes respectively, ""do you have a lgihter? I dropped mine when I burned my finger."" I pulled from my jacket a silver one I had bought in the airport at home. Nadine looked at Kaytlyn, both ready for what they knew was only natural for addicts, ""We need a fix."" I smiled, ""be good girls and don't get blazed too much tonight."" They laughed and left the cafe blowing kisses and leaving the cafe back into it's original solitude. Kelsey could be seen walking towards the cafe after spying me in the window, she greeted Nadine and Kaytlyn, came in and sat beside me, ""How are you? I know there's something wrong, some of the girls don't realize their surroundings, but you seem down lately...it's scarily out of character."" ""I don't know anymore Kelsey...we're all just so broken."" Kelsey looked at me and took my flask and drank the last of it. ""I know, I know but what can we do?"" ""We do all these things drugs, drinks, and the need for company to cover what we are afraid of. Like putting a bandage over a cut you didn't wash, after a while it gets too hard to control."" Kelsey nodded in agreeance and got up from her chair, ""look we are away from everything, overseas, in a beautiful city, let us be infectious for just a little while."" I laughed, ""because we are a sickness my dear.""

"event","the willowz inspired this one. 

She felt so dirty. like the snow, trampled on and on, dark and unpure. Almost jaded like a sales person at christmastime. The same smile. The same laugh. She was sleeping on the bed attached to the window sill when the radio seemed to scream at her in disdain. ""you know you can own this world child, you just gotta try."" Her painted on eyes opened, the room was grey and cold, the lack of colour could have been a black and white photo without a filter. She shouted at the radio in a look of crazed, blazed and hazed temperament. now her final questions stood as, to whom she owes this wardrobe to? and to whom first told her she could own the world?

he was an old soul they told him, injecting his own sweetened words to anyone who could have it. because he knew if he flattered someone enough they would take hold to him like a string takes to a kite. now he was just in an alley, wasted and unchaste. he heard the screams of an aggravated girl, probably psychotic he thought. he looked up to where the first window of the building was. white sills, no curtain. he heard some static rock music coming from an unseen player. he thought, well this could be interesting. 

she opened the window and threw down a box of non-descriptive characters, old polaroids with numbers of vogue boys, which if dialled today would be out of service. a cashmere scarf with the stale scent of a burberry cologne now unknown, faded with age. another an album of photo booth pictures, in which incapsulated the happiness of moments, the embarassing faces made and smiles that could never be faked. a cap that she could never find to where it belonged. a list with the songs she listened to when she was in love. now that she was out of love and out of anything she needed some time away. a time where she could stop looking at old photos of how it was. fuck how it was. nostalgia was killing her and now she was paying for it. 

while looking up he saw a pigment of a girl, lined eyes and a past that made history. then something he did not expect. a box flew from her hands like a dove from the hands of a sad eyed child. he stepped out of it's way as it pummelled to the cement, informing him of it's heavy importance. he picked up the box and twiddled around with it's contents. ahh he thought the contents of past loves, lies, and damned demise. he climbed the few steps of the fire escape to the open window where the wind blew freely in with no inhibitions, just like a friend who walks in your house with their shoes on. he lingered in front of the window in hopes she really wasn't psychotic, for a second imagining all the possible, terrible things that could happen. 

she sat on the floor, eye liner smeared, radio turned up to the most possible setting. she wrote a few lines furiously on her wall. she heard a creak coming from her window. she turned around in slow motion scared to see what she would find. 

he saw a girl who was still a girl. in need of some comfort. he smiled at her with the box in his hand, ""you know if we were in america, i could probably sue you for endangerment."" 

she clapped her hands to her mouth. ""i am so sorry."" 

he said, ""girl you're the one, you better meet your demise."""

she saw him again. skinny with a mess of brown hair. a look of wisdom and depression, were like pools of dark in his eyes. he wore a scarf to hide his neck from the unforgiving cold, he shivered as his hand tried to light his cigarette. he said to her smiling, ""Keeps me warm."" she laughed when his lighter failed and held out hers, shiny, black and compact a fire lit at the top. ""Thanks,"" he said, ""want one?"" she shook her head and her hair was like water rippling with each movement. ""i'm trying to quit."" he nodded. ""admirable, tried to once, failed miserably."" the snow was falling lightly and the two were under a canopy outside a glittering hotel. she slid down the marble wall where she leaned and sat down on the floor with her legs out in front of her. she wore skinny grey jeans and boots. she looked up at him, ""sit with me,"" he looked around and sat like her with his legs in front of him. ""so...tell me something exciting."" her dark eyes looking at his with a childish curiosity. ""you mean a story?"" he said smiling, he inhaled his marlboro 100, ""I have lots of those,"" her eyes twinkled in anticipation. ""well, there was once a very lovely, very frightened girl..."" after he finished the sky had turned a californian ocean blue, dark, curtained by a thick layer of clouds. as if hiding a secret, or clothing the bare skies, fearful of being a naked slate. They now both held cigarettes in their shivering hands. ""so what are we to do now?"" she asked. ""live i guess"" he said getting up. he held out his hand to help her up, she took it, stood up and looked closely at his face, laughed and said, ""thanks, darling."" she walked to the ashtray standing solemnly outside the doors of a lit up world outside dim and lightless. she put out the cigarette. she kept walking, his eyes watching her leave. he pulled out a camera and took a picture. if that was the last of her, he wanted to remember forever. he huffed and started to walk in the opposite direction. his head turned down watching his leather shoes kick the snow as it came down, his hands still in his tailored jacket. he suddenly felt a small pang of pain hit his back. his face coiled in pain and surprise. he turned around to find her laughing, snow incriminatingly covering her gloves. ""where are you going? come on."" she laughed still as she threw another ball of snow at him. it surprised him how far she threw and how it hurt. he had no plans at all. he walked swiftly up to her and she abruptly kissed him on the cheek and said locking eyes with his, ""so we'll live."" she threw her arm around his shoulder and let her head dall aimlessly, ""i guess we're friends."" she took his hand and led him to a guitar shop called ""the strings of hearts"", she pulled a set of keys from her tweed coat and opened the door, into her world. ""this is yours?"" he asked. she nodded turniong the lights on, ""it used to be a record store my family owned, it was given to me after it closed."" the store had murals on the walls with lyricss scrawled everywhere. she handed him a black permanent marker, ""write the best line to describe right now."" he took the marker from her and wrote. ""Your just a girl of my dreams, but it seems my dreams never come true"" it was a messy scribble. he looked over to where she was and saw she was sitting on a stool with an acoustic strunning unarranged chords. then she sang softly, ""i first met you down on lovers lane, the birds were insane, flapping all about, softly you would sing, swinging in you swing, it wasn't night it wasn't day."""

she cries when she is angry. she laughs when she has nothing left to say. she reads when she has had enough. she is a depressed girl in need of a drug to take away what she feels. she hates confrontation. she only knows herself. what others may think is debatable about her. she likes music she can live her life to. she has many friends but few other halves. she will rely on you at unexpected times. if she has a means of contacting you she will. she will almost always pursue an adventure. she sometimes surprises herself. she is self conscious but has the highest self confidence you will see. she will beat you in pretention anyday. she doesn't get intimidated. she wants a beautiful boy who will sing songs and write them. she wants the unknown. she pursues life and death. deep down she doesn't like herself. she insults her works of articles, poems, and art. she believes in something bigger than this world. she'll be your inspiration. she'll be the death of you. don't believe her but do to please her. when she wants to be with you she really does. when she says she's busy this weekend she probably is getting lost in her city. she wants to love. she lives in her own world."

"event","god i'm rundown, tired and sick of everything... i hate how the friends i have developed, they slip away, each day by and by, bit by bit, one by one.  i don't think they may be mad at all but just contain no feelings about me anymore.... the pictures we took, the laughs we had, and how cold i was walking on the street with us. the smell of you getting high...being high in public, me concerned for you. the thing that makes me sad the most is that i see all of you go out together, become close and it makes me feel like i'm outside of this facade glass building looking in like an intruder. security will come soon. i don't like the way i am with you. quiet and eager to please. i refuse to be that. but still am and it concerns me. anyways i skipped today because i need a break from this. 

love youuuu
have a good day"

"event","there is some strangeness recently, right now i feel so indescribably still it hurts, or maybe i just feel numb. prospects that have been in the back of my mind, but now seems to be edging up to the surface. now it's either i feel too much or nothing at all. i wish at this moment i was somewhere else, london, new york or even l.a. perhaps...well at the least. i feel like i have been on this extensive trip trying to find some kind of thread that would lead me to being finally content. maybe if i moved somewhere here, got this, bought that, made different friends, called old ones. i would be. maybe. but from my experience that hasn't happened. i try. with all my reasons in my head that circle around me, i really do. just, one day i know i will leave here, do what i have been wanting to in the longest time."

"event","for now i am satisfied. there is nothing here for me, besides the predominant normality of fake friends. i want to go somewhere i can be content and myself, without me running conversations in my head, trying to find out if they will respond to what i will say. my eyes are almost dry now. the weekend spent filled with tears looking upon raindrops. i blame the weather. every week now i have been filled with a sudden depression. at the end. it is always like that, now two years in succession. last year i was in the lowest of the lows. i tell myself that it is the ending of things that make me sad. the ends of years, weeks, minutes, seconds, friendships, loves, happiness. the ending of a laugh, a smile, a hug, a kiss, the end of an intigued look. when i walk past a stranger i wonder if we had met before, will we ever meet again, will i pass them by unnoticed. i wonder how many people i have passed by that were like this themselves. today the sun sets in my mind covered by dark grey clouds, i think in the sky, way up the sun is shining unblocked with all the clouds at its feet. 

""and underneath my skin
i am faded
and after this breath 
another one's worth taking""

my head hurts have a good week"

I was almost attacked, again, by someone's loose dog.  It was some kind of mini-doberman  I didn't kick it in the face only because I knew I'd get a load of shit from the owner and others there for hurting the ""poor"" dog, even though it was charging me.  I also realized if I kicked it, that would mean a definate fight, and I would have to finish it by not just injuring, but in fact killing the dog, which would definately get the owner and others at the building pissed at me.  That is not a good thing when I have to work there everyday, assuming I still had the job after slaying the animal.

"event","Stop.  If you havn't seen the movie, just stop reading now and go watch it, even if that involves going and purchasing the DVD.  Yes I said DVD.  The deleted scenes and outtakes are well worth the extra 2-5 dollars.  If you don't have a DVD player, find or buy one.

Now, if you've seen the movie and aren't a brain-dead twit, you surely know of its greatness.  Surely then you will be as pleased as I am by the news of a sequel.  Shooting is beginning in the spring of this year.  If I was a silly fangirl I'd be running around squeeling like a certain friend does quite regularly, however, being male and more reserved I'll settle for smiling to myself.  For reference, I'll be looking foreward to this movie in the same way others looked foreward to the Matrix: Revolutions, and Return of the King.

"event","Good News:
I have finally successfully located an internet access point where I can use AIM express, my prefered method of conversing with others for the sake of killing the demons of boredom.

Bad News:
As would be expected of my luck today, there is NOONE online to converse with at the moment now that I have AIM express running.  As well I have yet to purchase myself any kind of birthday present, something I feel MIGHT pick up my spirits marginally.

Neutral News:
While trying to find a way to access the internet on campus on a PC I have decided on a new hobby, lockpicking.

"event","Well today has been one big dissappointment....

To be fair I'll start by stating that I did wake up pleased, as I had several enjoyable dreams last night that left me feeling happier with myself.

Since then however, the day has gone downhill faster then a girl who loves to suck cock.  Being new year's day, the bus system was not operating so I've had to manuever about by foot.  That is not a big deal as I enjoy the exercise, however, it means I cannot go to Bangor to shop(where all of the good shopping is), and thus am left without that to do.  I was intending to then walk over to the university to go online awhile.  On the way I had intended to photograph for my Mom the sign outside McDonalds.  On everyone's birthday they post on the sign ""Happy Birthday <whoever>"" and I thought my Mom would enjoy seeing my name up there; she likes that kind of thing.  Well, come to find out, for some reason or other they did not put a sign up for me like they do for EVERYONE else.  I guess the new philly cheese steak meal is more important then me.

On to campus I walked, and come to find, as I had feared, the computer cluster is closed today.  I'm left to use the Macs that are set up as ""email"" computers.  They let me on the internet but they refuse to run AIM express, so, its kind of lonely and boring online.  Lunch at the union was good, though it was darkened by thoughts of how alone and unappreciated I am.

This birthday is merely an exclamation mark in the facts of my life.  Noone to kiss on New Years eve.  Noone gives a flying fuck that its my birthday.  Noone would miss me if I left my job, or dropped off the face of the Earth for that matter.  Noone has given me a present or so much as a happy birthday wish, although there really hasn't been the opportunity for those that know its my birthday.

Although, to be fair, I did get one present.  It was from the university.  I found in my email box this morning that, as I expected, I'm now on academic probation because I said screw it to my classes last semester.  Happy Birthday to me....

"event","With every passing moment in that place I find myself further and further trapped in some real life Dilbert experiance; that place being McDonalds.

Today I was scheduled for 3 1/2 hours, just short of enough time for me to be given a break.  Besides that point... why the hell 3 1/2 hours?  It is hardly worth my effort to go over there during the middle of the day for that.  It prevented me from effectively doing anything productive today because of its placement right in the center of the day, taking a chunk out of both morning and afternoon.  I know I'm not explaining this point to its fullest but trust me, it sucks ass.

Imagine McDonalds as a dirty old whore who is making a couple bucks giving some geriatric woman a rim job.... that is what today amounted to.

"event","After journaling this morning I suddenly had plenty of good news that I wanted to share, yet, there was no time.  However now I may sit back after a long day at work and reflect.

--

To begin with, I'd like to thank a friend of mine, Becca, for providing me with a song I've been searching for for several weeks.  It was relieving to be able to get that off my mind as it had been chewing at me like an ill trained puppy.

--

Later this morning I was lucky enough to share a conversation with a young lady named Shauna who holds a special place in my heart.  I was under the impression previously that she was angry at me for some reason, and in fact had a somewhat strange nightmare about it last night, ending with her becoming very cold, quiet, and unresponsive.  However, that was just a bad dream, and in reality, come to find out, she wasn't angry at me at all, and I had just misinterpreted a joke.  In any event, I am pleased by this news as it lightens the load on my mind, as I could not fathom why she possibly could be mad at me.  Besides this we had a very otherwise enjoyable conversation which quite illuminated my day afterwords.  I cannot say how happy it makes me to talk and spend time with her.

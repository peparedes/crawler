"event","Okay...Today is good so far.
I had my normal yogurt.  And for a lunch/snack I will have a hard boiled egg and cottage cheese. 
Then I have some tuna for my real lunch.  HOpefully I won't eat them all at the SAME time (like i did on Monday!).  I want to eat smaller meals, five times a day.  It seems to work...and I'm not hungry all the time. 

I'm nervous to weigh in on Tuesday.  It's been two weeks.  I'm so afraid I will not not lost ANY...or would have gained.  Going to Ben's dad's house in the country was NOT good for my diet.  Can we say:  Eggs and Pandcakes cooked in bacon fat????  OMG>.....YUM!"

"event","Well, I didn't order wings last night.  I DID try to eat one wing..but it was so freakin' hot that I couldn't finish it.  
So here is what I had for dinner:
1- Bite of a wing
2- Piece of bread (no butter)
3- Two pieces of gator bites (YUM!)
4- Thai cobb salad, hold the bacon.  Only thing that was bad in the salad was the gouda and the dressing.

So...over all i think i could have done better but I could have done worse too!  So I'm not TOO upset.  Plus...I went jogging before dinner...so my metob was werkin'.  

I got up this morning at 5:30 and went to a spinning class.  It was much easier waking up this morning.  After class we did about  10 minutes of abs.  I feel good right now.  I treated myself to scrambled eggs from Joe's Market-Hold the cheese.  I figured the protein would be great for me this morning.  I can almost feel my body wanting some protein.  

OH...and I had sex for about 10 minutes this morning...does that count as a workout?? Probably not...I was on the bottom!  :)  Hee hee!

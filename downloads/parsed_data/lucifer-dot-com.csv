"event","I'm a <a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=manifestation"">manifestation</a>.  I'm also a <a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=potential"">potential</a>.  Click the links, read the words.  There was a post on <lj comm=""pantheon_dot_co""> about the dot_coms being out of character.  I have to admit that it perturbs me some.  I don't mean out of character as in ""that's not what I thought X was going to act like"" but out of character in the sense of breaking character.  I don't have one to break, honestly.  I've been around in this manifestation for quite a while and I learned to use the computer while spending time with a friend of mine, acting as their muse.  

I love my work as a muse.  It's what's been taking up a great deal of my time, actually.  Because I'm not some hot-shot power-deity, I prefer to work with a few people here and there, as I can.  Lucifer means light-bringer, and that applies to enlightenment as well.  This isn't to say that I cause it, but I can help effect it when I'm around.  Inspiration is in you, no matter where I am.  It comes in the moment that you look at things differently, that you turn the light into the shadows, that you pretend -- even for a second -- that the thing that is impossible is now possible, and you are inspired or enlightened.  I find that it's the things that we cling to most strongly as ""truth"" or ""fact"" that bring the greatest light when we turn them around.  These things shadow us, and I'm not talking about ""is there a God"" or ""life begins at birth"", those are in our faces a lot of the time.  I mean the mundane things like ""oh, I could never write a story"" or ""I can't draw"" or ""university isn't for someone like <i>me</i>"", those little blocks that are implanted at some point, perhaps it's just something that you assumed as a child and never articulated and so no one ever told you it wasn't true.  Watch out for those things.  You are living your life grounded on ""facts"" and beliefs that have, while logical, have no foundation in other people's reality.  You can step out of your reality.  Shine some light on those things.  Say ""why not?"" more often.  Question yourself.  I can't be everywhere at once.  You have to do for yourselves.  

There is the distinct possibility that you are wrong.  Possibly about everything.  I can guarantee you that you are wrong about some things.  Will you get the answers?  No.  You will never know if you are right or wrong.  You shouldn't let that stop you.  Make your beliefs and your faith into conscious choices.  Enlighten yourself.  

(As for you creators and creatrixes out there -- no, not the deities, the artists and writers and musicians and more -- don't let this concept of ""good"" or ""valid"" stand in your way.  Rebel against the critic within you.  That voice in your head that nags you when you work?  You know what to say to it don't you?)"

"event","I'm beat.  Sorry I haven't answered any of your responses, I've been out of town.  WAY out of town.  I'll tell you all about it in a later post.  I really wish you could have come too.  I just got in, corporealized, and started the coffee.  Seems I have some new readers... about 60 of you.  Nice to meet everyone.  I'll have a browse through my newly revised friends list as soon as I make this post.  

Sometimes coming back here is like diving into a septic tank.  One of the first things I do when I get here is, like most other folks, check the news.  It's not nice a lot of the time, I usually have to go scrounging for something that gives me back my faith in humanity and that whole free will bag.  If I'm desperate, I watch <i>A Baby Story</i> on TLC for a while.  That show just makes me glow.  Y'all are so cute when you come out.  

Back on topic now... Erica Pratt.  What did I tell you all about how amazing you are?  I'm sure you've caught the story; seven-year old Erica gets snatched by two men, bound and blindfolded with duct tape, and then abandoned in a filthy, locked room.  She chews through the tapes, breaks through the door, and smashes a window so she can yell for help.  Two other children get her out of the house, one stays with her and the other gets a policeman from down the street.  Five minutes later, Erica is sitting in the cruiser eating Officer Skaziak's chicken sandwich while Officer Harvey calls for backup.  

Lets get this straight.  Erica is seven.  She's no fool.  She knows that the world is full of bad people.  She knows about death.  Seven is the Age of Reason.  Erica is starting to ""get it"", just like the rest of us do.  With no idea where she is, and fully cognisant of how much some of her fellow human beings suck, and being indoctrinated with the myth that she should be a good girl, Erica decides to do something anyway.  She's not a good girl sitting in the dark, stinking room, drinking the juice and eating the chips her nice captors left for her.  She's chewing off her bonds and breaking things and getting away.  Erica's a hero, right?  You bet your carbon-based asses she is.  This, however, is our point of departure.  We say, ""Thank you, Erica.  Bless you."" and then we look at our own bonds and our own blindfolds and our own dark closets of the soul.

Most people, at some point, have been hijacked or kidnapped or locked away.  Don't buy this idea that you have to be seven years old in Philadelphia to say ""Fuck you"" to the things that are keeping you down.  I don't want any of you to look at Erica and think that little girl in her pink shorts-set and tidy braids has nothing to do with you.  She has everything to do with you because you are like her and you have it in you to chew your way out of anything.  Never think that heroism doesn't apply to you.  Whether you throw out your cigarettes or turn off your computer or talk back to that voice that says you're worthess/fat/ugly... you don't have to stay where you are if you don't want to be there.  You don't have to be good or wait for someone to rescue you from your limbo.  From where I stand, there is no sense of scale.  It's all heroism and you have it in you.  I just wanted to point that out.

My coffee's cold now.  I didn't think that was going to be that long a post.  I'm going to heat this cup up and have a look at those comments and that friends list."

"event","I hear this a lot.  ""I'm only human.""  What the hell kind of statement is that?  You're one of the most highly evolved species on this space marble and you're griping because you're ""only human"", using it as an excuse for shortcomings and as a ploy for sympathy.  Now, before you jump down my non-corporeal throat, let's get this right.  I'm not criticizing you for not being able to read minds (though the dolphins already have that one figured out) or leap tall buildings in a single bound.  What pisses me off is that you're stopping at not being able to do it.  Worse, you're passing up daily on chances to capitalize on things that are inherent in your human condition.  ""I'm only human.""  What the fuck is it with that?  Stop clinging to it.  Let go.  It's not falling, it's flying, trust me.

You may not be able to read minds but you sure as hell can afford to take the time to listen to what's going on in them.  You may not be able to stop world hunger on your own but you can choose to see that Tommy and Keisha and Omar don't all have to go to school hungry.  So you can't leap tall buildings in a single bound, but you can raise money for a paramedic helicopter that can, and you can start a movement to plant gardens on the top of those buildings so that the air you breathe is sweeter and there's a green place for people to sit and rest when the rest of the world is covered in ashphalt.  Sure, a single person can't stop HIV, but many of you can scrape up the cash to make it happen.  Homeless people in Venezuela or Africa or down the street?  Got vacation time coming?  There's already people out there building houses who need your help.  Can't build?  Make them sandwiches and bring them coffee.  Want to make a change?  That cop on the corner, sweating it out in uniform and bullet-proof vest, directing traffic because the power went down from all the air conditioners running... go take her a drink of cold water and thank her for her work.  There are six fucking <b>billion</b> of you out there.  There's no ""only"" about that.  

What you have as humans, perhaps the most important thing, that makes it impossible for you to be ""only"" human, is FREE WILL.  You have choices.  You can choose to get out of your minivan and onto the bus, even with four kids.  Take a snack and sing a song while you're at it.  You can choose to dedicate your free time to something that will benefit other people.  You can stop and talk to that left-out geek in the hall and pick up his books when someone trips him.  You can choose to gently educate the people around you and instill in them your passion for making the world a better place.  

Think outside of the damn box.  When you feel the weight of ""I'll never make a difference"" coming down on you, say ""<b>Fuck You</b>"" in your best rebellious voice.  You are trained to believe that there is a level at which doing something becomes significant.  Buying a few fire alarms and batteries and installing them for people in your apartment building who don't have them -- not much of a big deal.  Rescuing five of those people from a burning building -- big deal, right?  Do not let the crisis-oriented, TV-driven mythology of significance suck you down.  When you feel like you are only human, go pick up some trash, take the bus to work, ask someone how they're doing, bite back your sarcasm, let someone go ahead of you on the freeway, refuse to put someone else down, donate your cigarette money to the humane society, buy something organic, hold the elevator, let your uncle tell you that story again, smile at people in your building... do only one of those things and you will have made a difference.  

There is still time left, Francis was right, there is enough for all, you are all human but if you are as fully and magnificently human as you can be every single day with your precious and sacred CHOICES to be made every moment -- if you make every one of those consciously -- you won't be ""only"" human anymore, none of you."

Oh, wait.  I can read the instructions and think for myself instead of whining and expecting someone else to fix it for me.

Never mind.  I fixed it!

"event","So I'm a little touchy about being lumped in with <lj user=""satan_dot_com"">.  We're not the same, we're not even close.  If you read the records, I was around before Day One for you people, and he didn't come along until Day Six, by <lj user=""god_dot_com"">'s calendar.  We're separate entities.  Yes, I got banned from <lj user=""god_dot_com"">'s place.  Not welcome, no one home, return to sender... for <b>Pride</b>, not Deceit, not Malice, not Corruption.  No longer welcome.  It happens.  I'm okay with it.  I don't blame him for doing it, I was messing up his paradigm.  A little rude, but I still think I was right.

I admit to Pride.  I admit to thinking that I can make up my own rules.  I'm not petty, though, and I'm not cruel.  You humans, I want the best for you, I just happen to believe that I know what that is... thinking for yourself.  I'm Proud of that.  I have faith in Me.  Do you have faith in You?"

"event","There was no Fall.  No drama.  In the literal sense... hello, people, I have wings.  And they work.  I also have faith.  And it works.  Moreover, I don't follow your laws of Nature anyway except to humour you.  That whole Fall thing is playing on your typical primate fear of heights.  

Next, I don't have an issue with anyone.  I don't follow their rules, that's all.  I've been kicked out of more pantheons than I can count.  God_dot_com's people were the ones to make a really big deal about it.  

Some people would like to use the whole concept of the Fall as an excuse to wallow in the gutter.  I'm not going to dirty my feathers with that kind of thing.  I don't want your boob-shots, I don't want your platitudes, and I don't want you to blame me for your bad choices and guilt.  Grow up."

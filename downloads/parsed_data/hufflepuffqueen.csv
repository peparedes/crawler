"event","the branch that broke off doesn't look nearly as big in the day time as it did at night time.  Its still huge, but I wouldn't mistake it for a full tree.  the longest branch that fell is right around 40-50 feet long.  And the thickest around is probably just thicker than my waistline.  So, not as big as we thought.  Mom tried to take pictures, but pictures just don't do it justice.  When you go back and look at what you shot, it doesn't look a thing like what you were trying to shoot!

I've seen a couple cars this morning slow down and take a look.  Dad's going to work on it when he gets home tonight, which I assume means I am going to work on it when I get home from work :)  

Oh, and I got my first sunburn of the year.  I was sitting outside sams club selling candy bars for a fundraiser.  I was out about 2 hours.  I have long pants and a sweatshirt on.  I didn't even think to put sunscreen on!  And now my forehead is fried and it hurts to touch it!

ah well, gotta go get ready for work."

"event","Well, I am actually online right now, because I wanted to see if I *could* get online.  About 20 minutes ago, one of our giant trees on our property broke a branch.  In most peoples world, a branch down is no big deal.  But when you lose a branch off of one of our trees, its like losing a whole tree (though I admit this one is smaller than the last one).  I am explaining this really poorly.  Basically, the branch that broke off was as big around as the trunk on most trees.  It fell from, well, I don't know, about 75 feet up maybe (I am not good at estimating that kind of stuff).  It hit our cable line, but we don't think it hit anything else.  It barely missed our house.  I can't believe that it didn't hit the house honestly.  I was watching my first ever new episode of john and kate plus eight.  I was excited to see a new one, but it of course cut out less than 10 minutes into the show when the branch broke our cable line.  SO....here I am.  I think it only killed the cable to our house.  I don't think it hit a main line for our neighborhood or anything.  But I guess we'll find that out later.  I think mom was getting ready to call the cable people to inform them of the situation when I hopped on here.  Don't know what they would do about it when a) its a holiday, and b) its after 9:00pm.  But, we thought it was a good idea just to let them know about it anyway.

Guess I should get some job hunting done, and then go to bed since I have work early in the AM.

Have a great night all!"

"event","and alot has changed on Livejournal since then!  

I haven't posted in 46 weeks according to the live journal homepage.  Sounds about right!  I don't have any big updates (no time for the now), but got an urge to write on here, so here we go.  

I've spent the entire week being sick.  At first we thought it was just allergies (the tree pollen was out of control earlier this week here in Pittsburgh), but turned out it was a full blown cold.  So, I had no voice (or when I did have a voice, I sounded like a man --thoroughly confused my mom on the phone --- funny story!) the last few days.  Today I have ALMOST my real voice again, but not really.  So, anyway, tonight we went to the Pirates/Braves game (booya georgians - we kicked your butt!).  It was fun.  Alot of fun. I had a blast.  I didn't go to a single game last season.  But it didn't feel like I am used to, because I couldn't really yell or scream! :)  I did break down when we won the game (it went down to the end of the 9th inning, 2 outs, and we pulled out a win)...I couldn't help it.  So, after all that, my voice is going in and out again.  I hope I can talk tomorrow.  We have a big saturday at work tomorrow.  Oh, and I open :( 

Oh, so to fill you in, tonight there were two games in Pittsburgh - the Pirates, and the PENGUINS (lets go pens, lets go pens!).  They are having an awesome season.  Both games ended at almost the exact same time.  So the Pirates won, so they set off fireworks.  As we are leaving, we see that the Penguins set off fireworks too.  Great night for Pittsburgh.  I am sure the city will be hopping for hours after this! 
  
Good news! In 1 month, I will be getting together with 4 of the best girls in the entire world!  (Carol, Linda, Anita, and Coral) We haven't all been together in I am guessing about 13 years.  yeah, I think it was 1995 that was the last time all of us were together.  So, in June, we are meeting in a place in Virginia and camping.  I am so psyched, I can't stop thinking about it.  And I have another month to wait :( lol

I've been so BLAH for so long, that it is nice to be in such a good mood.  Makes me want to go out and do something fun more often.

Anyway, you all have a wondeful day (whenever you read this) and I'll catch you all later!"

"event","So, those of you that know me well, know that I hate water.  I have gotten better lately, but for most of my life I chose to drink as little water as possible.  Lately I have had constant headaches, and dry mouth and dehydrated lips.  I just read an article that really hit me hard.  I knew how bad I was suffering from dehydration every day, but I can't seem to force myself to drink more water.  I have also been having headaches almost every day.  I have headaches more often than not.  Alot of that is caused by my neck problems (which I am finally seeing a Dr. about!!!), but as I was reading some hydration articles, I came across this article, which makes me think this is a major cause of a lot of my problems.  My migraines could even be linked to my constant dehydration!  Anyway, in the study it said that over 75% of Americans do not drink enough water!!!  

I also read another article earlier this morning (oh about 2 am I would say), that said that my insomnia episodes could possibly go hand in hand with my TMJ.  As I read through the article, I wondered why I had never made the connection before.  I mean, it is not necessarily the TMJ that has caused all of my insomnia episodes, but it certainly was related to some of them.  In fact, I remember in college having jaw problems my freshman year and going to the university clinic for it at the same time that I was having my first bought of insomnia in college.  The doctor never made the connection (and she did know about both because she became more worried about the insomnia than the jaw problems once we started talking).  But anyway, it is fascinating how obvious the connection to the two is and I never saw it.

Ah well....I was up until well after 2 am this morning reading fascination health related articles.  There is so much knowledge out there and I can't seem to bring it in fast enough!  And the sad part is, I know I won't remember half of it in a few weeks.  HaHa oh well."

"event","Carol read a funny article in a magazine today, and it consisted of the following...a professor (anders henrikkson) collected a bunch of bad sentances from papers submitted by his students and compiled them into the following ""naration of the history of europe"":

 
Here's a good explanation of it:
 
""History,"" declared Henry Ford, ""is bunk."" And yet, to paraphrase George Santayana, those who forget history and the English language are condemned to mangle them. Historian Anders Henriksson, a five-year veteran of the university classroom, has faithfully recorded, from papers submitted by freshmen at McMaster University and the University of Alberta, his students' more striking insights into European history from the Middle Ages to the present. Possibly as an act of vengeance, Professor Henriksson has now assembled these individual fragments into a chronological narrative which we present here.
 


And now, here's the actual narrative:

""A History of the Past: Life Reeked with Joy"" 

""History as we know is always bias, because human beings have to be studied by other human beings, not by independent observers of another species. 

During the Middle Ages, everbody was middle aged. Church and state were co-operatic. Middle Evil society was made up of monks, lords and surfs. It is unfortunate that we do not have a medivel European laid out on a table before us, ready for dissection. After a revival of infantile commerce slowly creeped into Europe, merchants appeared. Some were sitters and some were drifters. They roamed from town to town exposing themselves and organized big fairies in the countryside. Mideval people were violent. Murder during this period was nothing. Everybody killed someone. England fought numerously for land in France and ended up wining and losing. The Crusades were a series of military expaditions made by Christians seeking to free the holy land (the ""Home Town"" of Christ) from the Islams. 

In the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular. A class of yeowls arose. Finally, Europe caught the Black Death. The bubonic plague is a social disease in the sense that it can be transmitted by intercourse and other etceteras. It was spread from port to port by inflected rats. Victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. The plague also helped the emergence of the English language as the national language of England, France and Italy. 

The Middle Ages slimpared to a halt. The renascence bolted in from the blue. Life reeked with joy. Italy became robust, and more individuals felt the value of their human being. Italy, of course, was much closer to the rest of the world thanks to northern Europe. Man was determined to civilise himself and his brothers, even if heads had to roll! It became sheik to be educated. Art was on a more associated level. Europe was full of incredable churches with great art bulging out their doors. Renaissance merchants were beautiful and almost lifelike. 

The Reformnation happened when German nobles resented the idea that tithes were going to Papal France or the Pope thus enriching Catholic coiffures. Traditions had become oppressive so they too were crushed in the wake of man's quest for ressurection above the not-just-social beast he had become. An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a church door. Theologically, Luthar was into reorientation mutation. Calvinism was the most convenient religion since the days of the ancients. Anabaptist services tended to be migratory. The Popes, of course, were usually Catholic. Monks went right on seeing themselves as worms. The last Jesuit priest died in the 19th century. 

After the refirmation were wars both foreign and infernal. If the Spanish could gain the Netherlands they would have a stronghold throughout northern Europe which would include their posetions in Italy, Burgangy, central Europe and India thus serrounding France. The German Emperor's lower passage was blocked by the French for years and years. 

Louis XIV became King of the Sun. He gave the people food and artillery. If he didn't like someone he sent them to the gallows to row for the rest of their lives. Vauban was the royal minister of flirtation. In Russia the 17th century was known as the time of the bounding of the serfs. Russian nobles wore clothes to humour Peter the Great. Peter filled his government with accidental people and built a new capital near the European border. Orthodox priests became government antennae. 

The enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltaire wrote a book called ""Candy"" that got him into trouble with Frederick the Great. Philosophers were unknown yet, and the fundamental stake was one of religious toleration slighly confused with defeatism. France was in a very serious state. Taxation was a great drain on the state budget. Their French revolution was accomplished before it happened. The revolution evolved through monarchial, republican and tolarian phases until it catapulted into Napolean. Napolean was ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained. 

History, a record of things left behind by past generations, started in 1815. Throughout the comparatively radical years 1815-1870 the western European continent was undergoing a Rampant period of economic modification. Industrialization was precipitating in England. Problems were so complexicated that in Paris, out of a population of one million people, two million able bodies were on the loose. 

Graet Brittian, the USA and other European countrys had demicratic leanings. The middle class was tired and needed a rest. The old order could see the lid holding down new ideas beginning to shake. Among the goals of the chartists were universal suferage and an anal parliment. Voting was to be done by ballad. 

A new time zone of national unification roared over the horizon. Founder of the new Italy was Cavour, an intelligent Sardine from the north. Nationalism aided Itally because nationalism is the growth of an army. We can see that nationalism succeeded for Itally because of France's big army. Napolean III-IV mounted the French thrown. One thinks of Napolean III as a live extension of the late, but great, Napolean. Here too was the new Germany: loud, bold, vulgar and full of reality. 

Culture fomented from Europe's tip to its top. Richard Strauss, who was violent but methodical like his wife made him, plunged into vicious and perverse plays. Dramatized were adventures in seduction and abortion. Music reeked with reality. Wagner was master of music, and people did not forget his contribution. When he died they labeled his seat ""historical."" Other countries had their own artists. France had Chekhov. 

World War I broke out around 1912-1914. Germany was on one side of France and Russia was on the other. At war people get killed and then they aren't people any more, but friends. Peace was proclaimed at Versigh, which was attended by George Loid, Primal Minister of England. President Wilson arrived with 14 pointers. In 1937 Lenin revolted Russia. Communism raged among the peasants, and the civil war ""team colours"" were red and white. 

Germany was displaced after WWI. This gave rise to Hitler. Germany was morbidly overexcited and unbalanced. Berlin bacame the decadent capital, where all forms of sexual deprivations were practised. A huge anti-semantic movement arose. Attractive slogans like ""death to all Jews"" were used by governmental groups. Hitler remilitarized the Rineland over a squirmish between Germany and France. The appeasers were blinded by the great red of the Soviets. Moosealini rested his foundations on eight million bayonets and invaded Hi Lee Salasy. Germany invaded Poland. France invaded Belgium, and Russia invaded everybody. War screeched to an end when a nukuleer explosion was dropped on Hiroshima. A whole generation had been wipe out in two world wars, and their forlorne families were left to pick up the peaces. 

According to Fromm, individuation began historically in medieval times. This was a period of small childhood. There is increasing experience as adolescence experiences its life development. The last stage is us."""

"event","Well, tomorrow is the big day.  I live for the international youth convention at 7:45 tomorrow morning.  I'll be gone until the following Monday.  I am getting so excited I can't think straight!!  I am just looking forward to the many amazing things we are going to experience while out there.  I'll try to remember everything in enough detail so that I can post it on LJ when I get back.

Funny story:  Last week, my dad and I took a bunch of my stuff to a storage unit I am renting (someone gave me a couch and chair, and I had no where to keep it, so I finally had to get a storage unit).  Anyway, we're driving up the highway, and dad is right in the middle of a sentance, when all of the sudden he says ""oh crap.""  I said ""what, what, oh crap what?""  And he says ""one of your boxes just went flying off of the back."" And I was like ""oh no!!""  Then he asks me, ""What was in that big box?""  and I didn't know which big box he was talking about.  Luckily this happened right beside a truck weigh station, so he was able to pull over, and then back up through the weigh station (which was not operational that day), so we could try to retrieve the box.  HOwever, before we got there, a big truck CREAMED the box.  Tupperwear was ALL OVER THE ROAD!!!  Most of the pieces were so badly damaged that you couldn't even tell what they had been.  But my strainer (for pasta and such) was sitting out in the right hand lane, and my big sea world cup was sitting right on the dotted line in the middle of the highway.  Traffic was heavy enough that we couldn't go try to rescue anything.  All we could do was sit and watch the sea world cup bounce around as it got hit over and over again (but it remained in one piece - atleast while we were there watching).  Finally we drove away, and a little later on down the road we saw the actual box and a couple of the larger tupperware containers.  Dad just felt awful and he just kept beating himself up over it.  I just kept laughing at the situation.  I never got upset about it.  I was just happy it was tupperware and not something really expensive or irreplacable.  Dad still brings it up once in a while.  I still think it is funny.  Thought you would all enjoy that story.

Lets see, what else?  Ah yes, I am staying in the Grove City store (atleast that is what they say now...it may change in a few days).  They decided that they couldn't afford for me to go to another store just incase Celeste went into labor early.  They wouldn't be able to make it through back to school, so they decided to keep me there instead of sending me to the new store in Pittsburgh.  Next time I talk to my DM, I am going to see if this decision is final.  If it is, I may try to get an apartment with some work friends closer to work since gas is so expensive right now and I have to drive so far.  We'll see though..it all changes fairly often in this company.

Well, its about time for dinner, and I still have a few things I need to do before the trip.  So I'll talk to you all later."

"event","So I found out today that 3 of my close friends from Wooster have gotten married in the last two months.  Also, two more got engaged during that time.  And, the best news of all is that one of my best friends had a baby today!!! yeah!  Lots of exciting stuff going on while I am not there.  Curt also got a bike.  I knew that was happening sometime soon, but found out today that it is a reality now.  

In other exciting news:  So the other night I woke up around 4:00 am to a bunch of fluttering around my room.  All I kept thinking was ""stupid moth waking me up.""  I kept grumbling that over and over again while I tried to stand up to turn on the light (I had to yank the cord on the ceiling fan).  As soon as I stood up I got wacked by the ""moth"", and I realized right away that that was NO MOTH!!! So I dropped to the bed and tried to keep as low as I could. I am blind as a bat (no pun intended) without my contacts in or glasses on, so I started rummaging around on my side table trying to find my glasses.  As soon as I put them on I saw a pretty decent sized bat hanging from my blinds, clearly as confused as I was.  I picked up my cell phone and called my parents (who were sleeping in the other room!) and just kept saying ""there is a bat in my room"" until mom came into my room.  I went to the livingroom so that I could sleep on the couch while my dad took care of the bat.  We still have no idea how it got in there.  But let me tell you, it doesn't matter how cool I think bats are - they are not something I like to wake up to after only 2 hours of sleep!!!

And even more exciting news:  I do NOT have to fix my windshield to pass inspection!!!! YAY!!  So, that cuts off 5 or 6 hundred dollars of the repair bill I am NOT looking forward to in the next month.  So that really helps me out. 

Well, it is storming pretty bad here, so I had better get off of the computer."

"event","So, I was driving the other day when I heard the radio announcer say ""and now, a brand new band out of Columbus that is really starting to take some notice, here's O.A.R.""  I was blown away that people were playing O.A.R on the radio this many hours from columbus.  I was also however blown away that a)  afterwards people called in and were either asking for more information or telling how much they love the band or b) were chewing out the radio announcer for saying they were a brand new band when they had been listing to OAR for years.  It was really quite funny.  

Anyway, so after all that last week, I was looking for tickets for a concert that I want to take one of my friends to for her belated birthday, when I stumbled across reviews for other concerts that have taken place at this amphitheater.  Guess who was SOLD OUT a few weeks ago?  O.A.R   Thats right, and people kept saying how they have more fun at O.A.R. concerts than any concerts for world famous bands and how it is the best show they had ever been to.  It was weird also, to read about all these people from out of town (not PA OR OH) who drove all the way to Pittsburgh to see O.A.R because it was the closest concert to them and they have been listing to O.A.R via the internet for YEARS.  Even a couple of them said how they found out about OAR through friends who attended college in Columbus, and how they soon became the most played band in their dorms in places like NY and NJ.  IT was CRAZY.

anyway, just thought that was some interesting info for all of you Columbus folks or OAR fans.  If you are neither, I am sorry I have bored you so long about something you don't care about :)


I'm heading out soon to look into buying a new car.  Wish me luck!"

Beginning in July the State of Illinois will use speed cameras in areas designated as ""Work Zones"" on major freeways. Anyone caught by these devices will be mailed a $375.00 ticket for the FIRST offense, but the SECOND offense will cost $1000.00 and comes with a 90-Day suspension.  Drivers will also receive demerit points against their license, which allows insurance companies to raise their rates.  
This represents the harshest penalty structure yet for a city or state using PHOTO enforcements. The State will begin with TWO camera vans issuing tickets in work zones with speed limits lowered to 45 MPH. Photographs of both the Driver's face and License plate are taken.

I am getting really bummed out.  The more research I do for going back to school, the more I realize what my limitations are going to be.  I have to get some really good loans to be able to afford anything it seems!  Plus I tried to look online at some apartment rentals in some of the college towns I am interested in, and there just isn't anything remotely in my budget.  Honestly, there isn't anything that appeals to me, even above my budget! Slim pickins out there it seems.  I might have to go visit some of these places and pick up apartment rental guides because these online ones show nothing but luxory condos for like $1600 a month.  And they don't really look much nicer than some of the places I have lived in before! Who pays that much for a crappy one bedroom?

"event","Alright, I am back and ready to continue with the never ending, long winded explanation of the last year.

Besides work, the only thing I am involved with is the church.  I can't attend many sundays because of work (you technically can't request off sundays), but I go whenever I can.  We were meeting on Wednesday nights all fall and winter, so I got to attend a lot of those. But the most recent news is that I became one of the Youth Leaders and will be going to California in July to the international convention.  Sadly, I think that going back to work at the Grove City store my lower my chances of getting Wednesday nights off for Youth Meetings.  I don't know when else to have them though.  Luckily I have a partner in Crime who has a better work schedule than mine who can be relied on to be there.

Another thing I was involved in this year was the March of Dimes.  I held a bakesale at my work two weekends ago and raised like $85 dollars.  Over the last month, just by asking people to donate a dollar as they came through the register, our district was about to raise like $15,000.  Companywide we were able to earn over $800,000.  This past sunday was the walk (Walk America).  Kristi from the Grove City store and I were the only two from our company who did the 10K.  Everyone else only did a 5K.  Man am I sore today.  I ache all over.  Kristi is almost a full foot taller than me and I had a really hard time keeping up with her big strides.  Her legs come up to my chest almost (as my DM had to point out to me as he laughed at me after the walk when I told him how hard it was for me to kepe up with her long strides).  We were speed/power walking and when we finished the 10K there were still lots of people from the 5k that were just finishing.  So needless to say, we really pushed ourselves.  It was really fun and I am glad I got to be involved.  We got lots of ideas for ways to raise more money next year, too.  I like being involved in something like this.  Something I can volunteer my time for, but that I can visually see that I am making a difference. 

 I got to see two ity bity babies (twins) and it turned out that they were almost 2 years old.  They were so tiny when they were born that they are just tiny todlers now.  Everyone walking in their name (you could walk for someone you love if you want) had the same t-shirt on that had their names and date of birth and then said ""born small but mighty"".  There were also lots of people walking for babies that didn't make it and they would have shirts on that would give their names and their date of birth and then say something about walking in memory of ...  It was sad.  Pittsburgh also has a group that meets that are all parents of premie twins, so all of their shirts said ""got twins"" on the front, and then on the back had pictures of their own babies and said something about thanks to the pittsburgh such and such hospital NICUs.  There was a printing press company that had the slogan ""big steps for a tiny cause"" which I liked and didn't like because people could take it the wrong way. 

Anyway, I am REALLY glad that I got to be involved in it this year.  My DM got up on stage and talked about March of Dimes and was on tv.  Also, our company teamed up with Dr. Schols this year.  Every time someone bought a certain Dr. Schols shoe, they donated a dollar to march of dimes.  Then dr. schols let them bring the shoes to the walk for people to try them on.  They got a free coupon to go buy the shoe, got entered into a contest to win a free pair of the shoes, and got a free bottle of some kind of sore foot cream from Dr. Schols to be used on their sore feet after they finished the walk.  Not only did our company donate all that stuff, but Monticellos donated free food for everyone once they finished the walk.  It was a great day for everyone.  Seeing all the little miracles around me made me realize just how important this program is.  I think everyone should pick a charity and get involved, just to feel that incredible feeling you get on helping someone else out.  Keith and Carol can tell you all about this: they are very active in charities, from helping the environment to helping out with habitat for humanity.  Really, its quite an incredible feeling and I recommend everyone pick one to get involved with.

Anyway, Another thing that happened this year was that I got asked to be in Shylah's wedding.  Its a lot of work, but a lot of fun.  Shylah is doing everything herself, so she recruits us every other month to come help her with a project.  We've done things such as make the invitations (this was awesome! We made them from scratch and they look professionally done) and make the favors and the bubbles and such.  Its all been a lot of fun; a lot of work, but alot of fun.  Its been great getting to spend time with all of the girls, though its hard to get the time off.  The last one was this past weekend (yes, the same weekend as the walk).  We addressed and stamped all of the invitations.  This was a lot of work, but nothing compared to actually making the invitations (that was ALOT of work).  It was a really fun night.  I was sad to have to leave.  

Oh! and I got another hair cut at shylahs house. My hair feels so short now, though it is still consider long in length! lol.  It feels so so so short to me though.  But it feels good.  I forget how light and free it feels to have shorter hair.  My long hair was so heavy!  They couldn't figure out how to do my hair for the wedding in a practical, comfortable, beautiful waywith my hair being as long as it was.  It just was best (for all of us) for me to get it cut.  So Sara (one of the bridesmaids) cut it for me and it looks really good.  its just hard to get used to it!  I'd say I've had a whole foot of hair cut off so far this year.  But anyway, now my head feels a whole lot lighter.  It'll be nice for this summer not to have that heavy hair weighing me down.

I guess that is all I can think of for now.  Hopefully I'll find time to update you all again soon!"

"event","Well, I've officially been living in Pennsylvania for one year.  So I've spent the entire day thinking about everything that has happened this year.  I haven't accomplished the main thing I wanted to do when I moved back home (figuring out what I wanted to do with my life), but I have it narrowed down.  I've had a lot of ups and downs, alot of fun, and I've worked my butt off.  All in all, its been a pretty good year.

The funniest turn of events is taking place this week.  When I moved to PA I ""temporarily"" got a job working at the shoe store in grove city.  That turned into a full time job when they found out that I was too good of an employee to let go, and they gave me a raise.  That continued to be a full time job this fall when all of the college students went back to school and they needed someone who could work hours that the college students just couldn't work.  Then, they decided to move me to another store and promote me to a manager right around Christmas.  I worked in that other store for 2 or 3 months as a manager, and let me tell you, it was a completely different working environment than the Grove City store.  Last month, they hired another manager at my store, so in order to get enough hours until business picked up for the summer, I've been working at 4 different stores the past month.  And now, this week, one year exactly from when I started working at the store in Grove City, I found out that I am being transfered back to the store in Grove City.  So, my year has kind of come full circle.  

This is a good thing and a bad thing.  Its good because I love working at the Grove City store.  Its bad because gas prices have skyrocketed and buying gas takes up such a big chunk of my paycheck.  Its a good thing because I'll have more opportunities to grow as a manager through the wild situations that pop up at the grove city store.  Its a bad thing because they decided to widen the road, bridge, and ramps at the mall, so there is construction there that makes my trip take much longer than it used to.  Its a good thing because I'll get to spend time with my aunt again.  Its a bad thing because there are now going to be 8 managers at my store for the beginning of the summer.  Two managers are getting transferred in (me and a guy from butler) one part timer is getting promoted to a manager in a few weeks, and then the five that are already there.  Now my aunt will be going on maternity leave and another one of the managers will be leaving when he gets his own store, but until then thats 8 managers in one store.  That could cause some problems.  We'll just have to wait and see.  But I think mostly its a good thing.  The grove city store is much busier and I will kept on my toes all summer.  Its crazy that I am no longer in school and working full time, yet I have less free time now than I did the entire time I was in school.  But, I bet alot of you feel the same way.

Anyway, we don't know how long they are keeping me at the grove city store.  The plan is to send me to a new store closer to Pittsburgh this August when our new store opens up.  But, plans can always change and they may find they want to send someone else instead.  Or they may find that they want me to stay in Grove City while my aunt is on maternity leave, and then I'll miss the opportunity to get a spot in the new store.  Who knows what will end up happening, but I just put my faith in God that it will all work out for the best.

So, the last year has been entirely spent working (at 4 different stores, but still for the same company!).  This ""temporary"" job has turned into a year long job.  And my DM is trying to turn it into a career for me.  I on the other hand want to go back to school.  I don't want to work retail for the rest of my life.  I mean, if they got me higher up in the company or at one of the offices, that would be different (and more importantly, it would be steadier hours).  I've pretty much narrowed down my school options to nutrition/dietetics or physical therapy.  If I stay in the Pittsburgh area, I have one choice for schools for nutrition- Pitt.  Which is really expensive, but not as expensive as the other Pittsburgh schools.  Most of which are more in one year that I owe for 4 1/2 years at OSU!!!  If I do PT, I would like to get my doctorate, which gives me only a few options in Pittsburgh as well.  Slippery rock also offers a DPT, but it is toward Grove City.  So if I continue to work for this company, I need to continue to work at grove city and not go to the new store near Pittsburgh.  Plus I need to see if I can get enough scholarships and loans to be able to afford going back.  I would rather not work full time and try to go to school.  The only way I can afford that is if I can get more stinking school loans.

Another option that has come up is for me to move.  Very few places apeal to me as places to move to.  Shylah, Meg, and Sara all are around the Cleveland area.  Dave, Gregg, Emily (and now maybe Nicole!) are in the Kent area.  My parents and grandparents are all going to be in the pittsburgh area, plus my aunt, uncle, and cousin are nearby. Nicole and Mandy are the only two I really know who are still in Columbus.  My sister and Keith are in Georgia and UGA offers some really good programs for what I am interested in.  But who is to say how long any of those people will stay where they are now.  My fear is that I will get accepted somewhere, move there, and then those people will move shortly after and I'll be there all alone.  I know, I know, I need to make my own place somewhere.  But I am not good at all about going out on my own and meeting people.  This last year has shown me that I really don't care enough about that to make any sort of effort at going out to meet people.  I know that I'll have more opportunities to meet people once I start going to school again, but even then, I didn't really branch out and meet many people in college before either.  I kind of relied on my sister and my roommates to help me meet people.  

So, as you can tell, I still haven't made up my mind for what I want to do with my life yet.  But I need to make a decision soon.  I can't start into either program full time this fall because I have too many prereqs that need to be done before they will admit me into either program.  But I have to decide which program to do and narrow down my school choices so I know what classes I have to take this year inorder to be admitted full time NEXT fall.

Another aspect of my life I wanted to work on this year was figuring out what I wanted relationshipwise.  Well, I've had opportunities for relationships - most of them long distance - but I just haven't jumped on any of them.  I have some stuff set in my head that I want for the future, and none of those opportunities would allow me to have the future I think that I want.  SO I keep thinking I need to rethink my future, but everytime I try to compromise and allow one of my important things to be pushed aside, I decide its something I am just not willing to give up.  So, I guess one year of thinking about it isn't enough, and I'm just going to have to get out there and date again and hopefully I'll either learn to live without some of the stuff on my list (you know, find that I don't really need what I think I need), or I'll in the process find a guy that somehow just fits perfectly into the kind of guy I really need.

Looks like I need to wrap this up for now.  Dinner time!  I'll continue later."

I am still working at all three stores and let me tell you, it is starting to get old.

I spent the entire day today going through all of my important papers in all of my files....it took forever and I am not done.  I hate doing this, but it needs done about twice a year and I haven't done it in a long time.  I ran out of time though because I have to leave for work in a few minutes.  Blah.

"event","Well, February and March are turning out to be very expensive months.  I am now thousands of dollars in the hole between paying all my medical bills from this winter when I thought I had insurance but it turned out I didn't (long story),paying for my camp lot ($450), Taking Curly to the vet for blood work ($175), taking Caramel to the emergency vet/etc ($300), taking my car in for work ($750), and I now have to get my windshield on my car replaced, which is going to run me another $600!!!  OUCH!

Plus, the winter months are the slow months in retail, so I haven't been getting as many hours as I used to.  

But, here are some more details for you.  Now I only have 13 minutes before I have to leave for work, so lets see how much detail I can go into.

1) Caramel has gained 8 pounds!!!!! Awesome.

2)I never told you about the insurance problems this winter.  Basically I've had insurance through my work since april 2005.  Well, in November I got sick with pnemonia and went to the doctor.  After the whole work up I found out that my insurance had been canceled.  The insurance company swore that my work had canceled it, saying that I went down below the required hours.  My work swears they never did that, and I didn't go down below the required hours ever.  So, after lots of investigation it turns out that the insurance company canceled my insurance because my work never took out my premium or down payment or whatever that first huge payment was.  But nobody told me.  Work didn't tell me I was canceled (they swore they never knew).  The insurance company never contacted me or work to see why I hadn't paid that initial payment.  And they never contacted either of us to say I was canceled.  So I went to the doctor, racked up a huge bill because I wasn't worried since I had insurance, and then found out I had to pay for it all myself! Oh what a fun situation that was.  Ugh.

3)okay, my car.  I took it in for an oil change and tire rotation on Tuesday.  Since they were already going to have it up on the rack, I decided to ask them to look at my rear passenger side wheel well because it kept making a clunking sound.  Well, my struts were shot - bad.  So they had to replace those.  But while they were working on my car they also found out that my muffler was very week and basically shot too.  Plus one of my exaust pipes was rusting through and needed changed, too.  So, I had them go ahead and change everything since I didn't want anything breaking on me in the middle of the night when I was driving home from work.  

4) oh yeah, work.  Well, I am once again without a home store.  Officially new castle is still my home store, but I am actually going to be working in three or four different stores.  There was a situation at another store and my store manager decided that she wanted to help out this other manager.  She asked me what stores I would be willing to work at, and I told her, and then she told me that she was thinking about bringing over this other manager, as long as I didn't mind.  I didn't mind, so she went to our DSM to ask if she could have the other manager, and he said yes.  We figured it would take like 4-6 weeks to get everything straightened out, but the store manager at the store that was having problems got mad and said we could have the other manager right away.  So now here we are with more managers than our little store can afford.  So....I am working two days in new castle, two days in cranberry, and one day in Grove city this coming week.  The week after I am working two days in grove city, one or two days in cranberry, and one or two days in new castle.  And then after that, its all up in the air.  No store is busy enough to NEED me full time yet, but I don't officially have a store.  But my manager has been really great about it all, and she has promised that I will get hours, and has promised that I can come back if I have a problem with whatever my store turns out to be.  So, I feel fairly comfortable with it all.  But a few days ago I was a wreck since I didn't know where I was going and how I was going to get hours.

OOOOhhh!! I have to leave for work now!  ACK!"

Not much has happened this past week.  Caramel is adjusting pretty well and is putting on weight already.  Curly and Moose are both adjusting well to her being here as well.  Moose still doesn't cuddle with her, but ateast he doesn't mind being in the same room with her now like he did the first couple days!  

We had a really big snow storm here last night.  It took me an hour and a half to get home from work last night it was so bad.  When I woke up this morning everything was covered.  I couldn't get my car up the back driveway and I couldn't find any keys to dad's truck, so I missed church this morning.  

Mom and Dad were at Niagra Falls all weekend for dad's birthday.  I guess it was super cold and super windy there.  But they seem to have had a good time anyway. 

I spent all day friday cleaning.  I spent four hours scrubbing the kitchen, and a little over one hour cleaning my bathroom.  I also went through a bunch of boxes of my stuff and tried to get rid of some of the stuff I really don't need.

Wednesday night mom cut around 4 inches off of my hair.  No one has noticed so far, but man can I tell a difference!  I just wanted to get all of the ends cut off and get some healthy growth going again.  I want it to keep getting longer.  I mean, I think I look really cute with short hair, and I enjoy short hair, but I also really like it when it is long.  I get lots of comments on it when it is long, from people I don't know even. SO, I think for now I am going to keep growing it out.  

I guess that is it for now.  I am on Instant Messanger right now, but so far there is no one else on there!  Everyone complains that I dont get on, and when i do get on there, no one is on!"

But I want you to know that I read every one else's everytime I get online so that I am caught up with all of your lives. 

Anyway, I do have something new in my life, so I thought I would atleast tell everyone about it.  I am keeping it simple, not going into details:

I have Caramel at my house right now.  I do not know how long I will have her - its only temporary until I find her a good home.  There were just some conditions that I wasn't happy with and I thought she would do better here, so Curt gave her to me.  We went to the emergency vet saturday (ouch did that hurt the old wallet!) and he says she will be fine in time (about 6 weeks time), but for now we just have to take it slow.  So mom and dad and I are pumping her full of love and taking the best care we can of her until she is ready to find a new owner.

Its just going to be hard because she has so many issues.  But we bought her a cage for when we aren't home and so far she is doing GREAT in it.  No accidents, she hasn't destroyed anything, etc.  Its only been 3 days but we can all already see improvements.  So if anyone knows someone with a big open heart that wants to take on a dog that is going to be a lot of work, let me know :)

Since I haven't made a real post since July, I am sure alot has happened that I need to fill you in on, I just can't think of much.

Lets see #1, I got promoted and sent to another store.  Its in New Castle PA (ironically, where my mom grew up), which is about a 45 minute drive from my house.  It seems to be going pretty good there so far.  I like certain things about the new store, but also miss certain things about the old store.  

#2.  There was a big storm here in the fall (I think it was october).  Carol's and my camping lot got hit really bad.  There were all these pocket macroburst (or was it microbursts?) that created tornado like conditions.  The Church camp office was completely destroyed, the camp lost like 40 old trees (2 of which were mine and carol's), and several cottages also had damage to them.  Our lot was the funniest, and the most photographed phenomenon.  I was told that all the area newspapers all kept photographing my lot. Anyway, one of the bursts hit my lot and uprooted two trees.  Now the trees' root systems were intertwined and spread out in about a 15-20 foot radius.  When the trees were uprooted, the took with them all of the ground in that 20 foot radius. So all of the ground was sitting at a 45 degree angle about 7 or 8 feet in the air.  I could walk under it!!  My storage unit was on top, so it was up 8 feet in the air and I couldn't reach it to take all of my stuff out.  Who knows if my stuff is still there or not.  But anyway, my fire ring was on the edge of the area that lifted up, so it is destroyed.  The actual ring went rolling and ended up in my one neighbors's lot up against their trailer.  I also have a huge rock on my lot that rolled the opposite way and is now up in my other neighbor's lot in their fire ring (it knocked their actual rings off and is laying where they should be).  its too heavy and I couldn't budge it.  Anyway, as far as I know, none of the trailers at camp got any real damage and most of the cottages just had minor repairs, so I am thankful for that.  Once the weather clears up I am going to head up there on my days off and start putting stuff back to normal.

This winter, my parents and I had a very interesting night.  It was snowing and the road was icy, and in like a 3 hour period we had three car accidents in our yard!  One happened right after dinner, but she only brushed the edge of yard and didn't actually fall down the hill.  like an hour later we had a guy in a big pick up truck hit the same patch of ice and he fly down our hill, took out one of our favorite trees, and ruined the front end of his truck.  It was hard to get him out because of the position he was in (and down the hill while the tow truck was up on top of the hill on the icy road).  Plus, if he turned his wheel at all his tire would be destroyed because his bumper was bent all the way into it.  Finally they got the bumper pulled out far enough that he could drive the car through our yard to the back driveway.  then the tow truck hooked on to his bumper and pulled it the rest of the way out so that he could drive his car to his friend's house.  But, while all of that was going on, there was another accident in which a car hit the same patch of ice and creamed into the tow truck!!!  It was quite a night, and luckily we haven't had anything like that happen since then.

Lets see what else.  Oh yes, curly had a bunch of hair fall out.  I took him to the vet's (yet again that really hurt the wallet) to do some blood work so we could figure out what was causing it.  Well, it turns out that he has chronic pancreatitis and has to be on a special diet now.  the vet thinks that the stress from the pancreatitis caused the hair to fall out in patches like that during one of his normal shedding periods.  Almost like the body was already doing it, but overdid it because of the stress.  Who knows, we can't tell if the hair is getting any better, but pancreatitis wise he is doing SO good.  The special food is really helping.

I think that is about it.  I can't think of anything else big that happened between July and now.  hope you are all having a great day and I miss you all.  Oh, and please email me your current addresses so that I can update my address book.  If you need my email address, let me know."

"event","well its been a while since my last real post.  I have been very busy at work what with large getting-ready-for-back-to-school shipments as well as the yearly inventory thing.  Very exhausting last couple of weeks.  But its been great.  There are SO many things that have happened that I know that I will not remember even half of them.  The basic rundown:

over the fourth of July week/weekend, I worked long long hours, including an open to close shift.  This makes for a nice paycheck, but a very tired Lisa. It was great though.  I have been in SUCH a good mood lately.  Its truly incredible.  Its like I am back to me again.  I love it.
On the fourth of July I worked another open to close, though it was only 9-7, so that wasn't so bad this time (we closed early because of the holiday).  Then a group of coworkers and I went to a nearby campground and hung out.  Mike had never been on a jet ski before, so Kristi decided to take him on one.  Its was so funny. He flipped them both trying to get on.  He finally got the hang of it and was having a blast.  Kristi thought he had mastered the whole balancing thing, but when he got caught off guard and flipped them both again.  It was so much fun.

Right after they got out of the water, we had to leave to make it in time for the fireworks.  We went to Jenna's friend's parents' house so we could have a more private showing and not have to deal with the traffic and people.  It was a blast.  

After that, we headed over to Mike's friend's apartment and hung out for a while.  It was Jenna's last night in town and then she was moving to Erie PA.  Mike and his friend had a little trick up their sleeve and decided to surprise Jenna with a going-away movie party at the local theater after it was already closed for the night.  It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  It was this really really classy old school theater that used to be a playhouse before it was converted into a movie theater.  We sat up on the balcony, had free popcorn, two types of amazing wine, and enjoyed eachother's company.  We ended up watching ""House of Wax"", and even though I am not a ""trendy scary movie"" fan, I really enjoyed the movie.  I am not sure if it was the actual movie, or if it was the whole atmosphere, but definitely one of the best experiences I have ever had.  

Pretty much between now and then I have just been working alot.  I have talked to Laurie, Lauren, Meg, Shylah, Jessica, and Kristy (all people from Wooster)in the last week.  Its been nice.  I also have made several trips to the campground, but every trip was the work on my Grandma's trailer and not to work on mine and Carol's trailer.  I learned some plumbing and completely fixed the plumbing in my grandma's trailer.  Now I am the plumbing master! wa ha ha

Thursday, Mike and I were supposed to take Heather to Pittsburgh for her 21st.  She ended up wanting to go dancing at a club - ugh.  Mike and I really didn't want to do that, but we had promised her, so we figured we would have to go.  Luckily, she called me at work and said she didn't think she wanted to go anymore.  Whew.  So Mike and I went out for dinner and went to see Mr. and Mrs. Smith instead.  It was most enjoyable.

I have seen way more movies since I started work at the shoe store than I had seen in the last 3 1/2 years.  Its been really neat.  So far I have only seen good ones, so I have been lucky.  

Well, Harry Potter comes out in a little over an hour.  Very exciting.  I didn't preorder the book, but if I have time tomorrow (of in the next few days) I am going to drive over by barnes and noble just to see if they have any.  That is what I did last time, and they had bought plenty of extras.  I am hoping that is the case this time.  I am so psyched.

No leads in the career field.  also, I am no closer to making a decision about what career path to take than I was a few weeks ago.  For some reason I have more options than I did a few weeks ago.  But hopefully that will lead to a breakthrough before too long.

Anyway, I am doing great.  I am psyched about my family church camp coming up in two weeks.  I am happy, and enjoying life.  Sorry it takes me so long in between posts, but I hate wasted my free time on the computer.  I am often too exhausted to do more than read my emails and go to bed.

love and miss you all"

"event","yesterday was a pretty blah day.  I couldn't fall asleep wed. night, so by 3:30am I was still awake and getting pretty upset.  I don't know what time I finally fell asleep, but that morning I slept in, and then took Curly outside and we layed around and watched mom paint for a while.  After lunch I went to the eye doctor.  My eyes have gotten worse, of course, so I have to get new everything.  I can't seem to find a pair of glasses that I even like.  They all looked terrible on me, and the one pair that looked decent didn't feel right. I also have to order my contacts because they don't keep my strength on hand.  It will take two weeks for them to get here and then I have to go back to see her after a week of wearing them for another appointment to make sure everything is alright before she will order the rest of the contacts. Ugh.  She also put drops in my eyes, so I was blind and in a bad mood for the next three hours.  I watched confessions of a teenage drama queen.  It wasn't very good.  I could tell it would appeal to a younger crowd, but there was a lot about it that I didn't like.  I called work last night and chatted with all of them.  It seems that the terrible storms scared away most of the shoppers, so they were VERY bored last night. It was so funny because I called to talk to one person and ended up talking to every single person working last night.  They just kept going ""Let me talk to her! I want to talk to Lisa!""  It was really funny, and quite flattering. I have to call again today because I forgot to ask about what we are supposed to wear over the holiday weekend.  Anyway, last night I watched home improvement shows with dad and then flipped through a magazine until Mom went to bed.  Then I got online and no one was on, so I turned on the tv and watched Nick at Night until midnight.  I slept in again today while Mom went to the airport to pick up my grandparents and my cousin.  She just called to say that the plane had been delayed, so who knows when she will make it back home again.  So now I think I am going to go work on my scrapbook for a while.  We'll see.

hope you are all having a good day!"

"event","I just finished the second night of shipment for this week.  We are DONE. It was glorious.  We not only got everything in (though it is stuffed very full), but we rearranged everything for the holiday weekend AND put out all of our new Accessories and Sundries (socks, book bags, etc).  The store looks great.  I really like it.  I am tired though.  

I slept in today.  Then Mom, Lucky, Curly, and I went to the new dog park we found the other day.  It was a lot of fun, but kind of a short trip(Lucky was pooped though and I had to get ready for work, so we left).  Curly ran all over the place and sniffed everyone's butts, in normal doggy how-do-you-do fashion. We met some nice, interesting people.  I also realized that there is no way I will ever get Curly to play fetch with me in there as long as there are other dogs around because he is too interested in smelling everyone else to pay attention to the ball.  Ah well.  IT definitely wore him out today though because he was snoring before I had even logged on tonight.  After the dog park, I went to work and found everyone in a really bad mood.  But, once they had figured out how to make all of the holiday weekend stuff work, everyone instantly turned into happy, goofy people.  It was great.  I had fun once all of their stress melted away. 

I tried to tape Jurassic park on the DVD recorder today. However, USA decided to play some movie called Fragile instead in the same time spot, so I didn't get it. AH well.  Later this week is Mission Impossible (one of my favorite movies even though I know most people don't like it).  That is all I tried to tape this week.  Not much on.

Time to work out, then to bed."

"event","Well, shipment went really really well tonight.  It was fun, we got A LOT done, and we were able to leave by 1:00 am.  When I got there, all the Pennsylvania big wigs of the company were there.  I was glad I was in the back and didn't have to see them and they didn't have to see me.  Basically they came in and watched how we ran the store, asked everyone a bunch of questions, and then they grade us on how well we did.  It was funny because when my DM talked to my store manager, he said they almost didn't bother coming because we were the only store in PA that has surpased all of our numbers the past 6 weeks.  But, of course, the one lady really wanted to come to our store and check us out because she never been able to before.  She was asking questions like ""this store is the only store in the state that consistantly meets, and even surpases the home delivery goal set by the company.  Why is that?""  How are you supposed to answer a question like that?  Um....Because we do our job and actually interact with the customers so they know that home delivery is often an option.  She kept grilling my aunt about the interworkings of the store.  ""What sets you apart from the other stores?  I just don't understand how you can have such high numbers every week.""  Um...because we do our job and actually interact with the customers so they are able to find exactly what they need, thus walking out of the store with very full shopping bags.  And my favorite: ""You really devoted yourself to that customer and her family.  I haven't seen interaction with customers like that at any other store. Do you think that is why this store does so well?"" Um.....YES.  I was so glad I was in the back sorting shipment so that I didn't have to endure that lady's questions.  As far as we know, they didn't have anything bad to say about our store when they left.

Curly is doing really really well here.  I only hope Caramel is doing okay.  I think she will be fine now that Curt is going to let her into the house with him whenever he is home.  Anyway, Curly adapted so well, so quickly.  He loves my parents, and he is totally devoted to me.  Its like no time passed between us at all.  He is laying in my bed snoring SO loud right now.  Mouse is on the tip-top of my desk taking a bath right now. Every once in a while he takes a break to look down and stare at the snoring dog.  Lucky seems to be fine around Curly too, though not being able to see him does scare Lucky some times because Curly runs by him so fast when Lucky is not expecting it.

He is such a good dog too.  We make him go to his cage whenever no one is home.  You just tell him to get in and he runs down the stairs, acrossed the basement, and goes and sits in his cage and just waits for you to shut the door.  Then he lays down.  I have heard him cry once or twice when I had put him in the cage and then he realized I was still inside the house.  Other than that, he is doing great.  Mom hates his new toy though.  Its called a giggle ball and mom says it makes a terrible noise.  I think its funny.  Curly seems to really like it, and thats all that matters. lol

We took a walk last night.  We decided to go up (and then back down) the humongous hill in the middle of our road.  I didn't think anything of it until today.  I kept trying to figure out why my foot hurt SO bad today.  It is definitely the worst it has hurt in months.  I took 600mg of Ibuprofin twice today because it was bothering me so bad.  I think I am going to have to work through the pain and just force myself to overuse my foot every day until it gets better.  I mean, its been a year and way over 4 months since the day of the surgery!! Come on all ready.  It just gets so swollen and tender when I only use it a little bit.  Luckily I can stand on it all day at work normally without problem.  Its just when I try to do anything athletic or anything that requires me to be up on my toes that it is a problem.  

oh, and weird circumstances dealing with Winnie-the-Pooh that I wanted to tell you all about.  On Sunday we found out that the guy who played Tigger died.  On Monday we found out that the guy who played Piglet had died to day after Tigger.  How weird is that?

Well, Moose is begging me to come get in bed and pet him, so I am going to go now.

hope you all are having a good week!"

"event","Its 4:00 am, so this is going to be a really quick post.  I open at work tomorrow morning and I know that means less than 4 hours of sleep for me tonight.  I had a really great last couple of days (but before that I hads some really crappy days)...here are the highlights:

1) tuesday night, got out of shipment earlier than expected.  When I started the car, the check oil light came on.  But it turned off the minute I put the car into reverse to back out of the parking spot. It continued to flicker on and off every minute or so for ten minutes.  It finally clicked on and stayed on, so I called Mom (who had been in bed for 4 or 5 hours already) to see what I should do.  She had me pull over asap and wait for her. This meant Lisa was in a very scary place, alone, for 45 minutes.  But if I had driven any farther I would have blown the engine up, so I guess it was a good thing I pulled over there. Mom came with oil (we put 3 quarts in) and we were able to get the car home. Turns out it was the oil sensor or something like that.  By the time the car got to Midas there was hardly any oil in it again, but what was there was squirting all over the place.  While they were waiting for the part to come in, they also put new tires on (threads were showing) and fixed a very very dangerously broken ball joint. Anyway, it was a late night: I fell asleep around 5:00am.  

2)The car was taken to Midas early Wednesday morning, and I went straight back to bed when Mom and I got home.  I had to do shipment at work wednesday night (had to borrow mom's van). Was a pretty late night and I was very tired.

3) got up Thursday morning, wrote a letter to direct loans, and packed.  (mostly Mom) spent the morning getting paperwork done to get my school loans redone to fix them at the interest rate I have now. Then I drove to Dave's.  Traffic was horrible. There is construction everywhere.  Got to Dave's around lunch time.  Watched some Battlestar Galactica and went for a really awesome walk in Kent. 

4) Friday I insisted on watching more Battlestar Galactica - and a lot of it.  I just couldn't stop. What an amazing show. I left Dave's around 5:30 and headed to wooster to see Jessica. Jessica, Kristy, Kristen and I went to Applebees and caught up on eachothers lives.  

5) got up really early Saturday and went to Curt's to get Curly.  It was really hard. I had a hard time leaving. Got back to PA around lunch time and Dad took us to a new place called rolly polly sandwiches or something like that.  It was really great (but it was no pita pit).  We got Curly all settled in and then I left for work. Work was kind of boring.  We were consistantly busy, and I spent a good chunk of the night at the register.  After work we went to see Batman Begins.  I really really enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to any of you Batman fans who have been disappointed thus far in the Batman movies. It was very good.  On the way back to Grove City, Mike got pulled over for speeding.  The cop didn't give him a ticket, or a warning, or anything.  Just told him how fast he was going, laughed at Mike's honesty, ran his license, and handed his license back and told him to slow down.  He didn't even take his registration or proof of insurance or anything. I just now got home and it seems that Curly was not on his best behavior his first day at my parents house.  There was a note from mom - something about peanut butter and most of a loaf of bread :( also, moose seems to have totally forgotten Curly. I have the scratch marks right acrossed my Boob to prove it. Man does that hurt.  Now I am going to bed. Hope this fills you all in somewhat on my life since my last post."

"event","I didn't sleep very well last night.  The computer was doing its weekly virus scan or whatever it is, so I had to leave it on until it was finished.  I couldn't sleep at all.  I got up and turned on the tv and watched the lifetime achievement award for George Lucas.  It was actually really fun to see all of the classic star wars people.  The guy who played Lando was really funny talking about himself being the original space hunk or something like that. After that was over I tried to sleep again, with no luck.  So I picked up harry potter and read that for a while.  Around 2:30 the computer finished its scan and I shut it off.  And wouldn't you know it, I fell right to sleep after that. 

My hands aren't working right today.  I keep dropping things and they were shaking really bad earlier.  They hurt so bad and I can't even make a fist with them.  I wonder what I did to them. 

I am looking forward to work tonight: only 221 cases coming in the shipment tonight!!  That is music to my ears after that 398 case week last week (which we just finished yesterday morning technically).  I work shipment again tomorrow night until about midnight.  Thursday I am going to go see Dave and his new apartment.  Friday I am going to see Jessica and her family.  Saturday I am going to get Curly and have Curt look at the cd player in my car. I have to work saturday, so I can't stay in Wooster very long at all. I have to leave by 10:00 am. 

Last night mom and I put together Curly's cage and put his blanket in.  I am getting really pumped about seeing him and Caramel.  I dreamnt about them both last night.  Before work today I am going to worry about getting the rest of the house ready for Curly to move in since it will be the last time I am home to do it.  I'm just so excited!!!

Well, I have a lot to get done today and nearly enough time to get it done in."

"event","Just wanted to let you all know about my day.  I painted from when I woke up until when I went to work.  I worked until close and then went to the movies with the guys from work.  We had plans to see Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but when we got to the theater, they didn't have any late showings of it.  Which was a big upset with everyone else because they had looked up the specific time that we had to be there for that movie and then the theater changed the time.  So, we ended up seeing Star Wars because we were already there and Mike hadn't seen it yet (it was the only movie showing even close to the time we got there..otherwise we would have had to wait for 1 hr and 15 minutes to see anything else).  I have to say I really really liked it the second time around.  Everyone from worked loved it, so I am glad we ended up picking that one.  I really enjoyed it and it was easy to look past all of the cheesy lines this time around since I knew they were there.  That way I was able to concentrate on the actual story, which was quite good.  I still couldn't get over Vadar's ""NNNNNoooooooooooooo!"", but who can blame me?

to bed with me.  I am exausted beyond comprehension."

"event","Last night I got to work at 2:50 and they were still unloading the truck.  Kristi and I went out on the sales floor and tried to figure out where we were going to put everything we were supposed to be getting.  We went back to the stock room just in time to see the truck driver telling Heather that they were short three boxes *ugh* .  Anyway, Kristi and Celeste went back on the sales floor and changed the plans for where to put everything based on what the packing list said we were getting. 

 After they had all of the boxes off of the truck and organized in the stock room, there wasn't enough room for people, let alone tables of shoes back there.  So we set up tables outside and started sorting womens casual and dress shoes.  There wasn't enough room outside for all of the shoes, so Kristi and I started taking shoes out on the sales floor and putting them on top of the bins they were supposed to go in while the others continued to sort outside.  I was just starting to run sandles in when the front door swung open all on its own.  I looked outside and it was windy, slightly dark, and all of the leaves were turned up.  I told everyone that we needed to get the shoes inside and someone said ""its okay lisa, the shoes aren't going to blow away."" So I had to try to keep my face straight as I explained that a big storm was coming and we couldn't afford to let the like 750 boxes of shoes (that had been taken out of the cases and sorted outside so far) get wet and possibly ruined since so many of them were womens dress shoes.

We got all of the shoes inside (almost all of them had to go out to the sales floor and just sit ontop of the bins) about 10 minutes before the storm hit! *whew* good thing I know a little more about storms than those people or we would have had a very bad situation.  After that, we went out on the sales floor and tried to get as many shoes into the bins as possible so that they were out of the customers' way.  It sucked to have to do that because we had to move all of the shoes anyway since we had to rearrange to store after close.  But, we couldn't just leave all of those hundreds of shoes on top of the bins with customers coming in and out of the store like that.

After we got most of those shoes out of the way, I went into the stock room and rearranged stuff so that there was enough room to set up three tables.  I have never done so much heavy lifting at one time!  I had to move entire stacks of cases.  They were so heavy and they were stacked to the ceiling, so it was almost impossible for me to get the top couple of cases down.  Plus, I feel it was such a waste to have to keep moving things all over the place.  It would have been nice to have been able to just leave the boxes stacked where they were, but it was impossible to do it that way because there was just no room to sort the boxes. 

 So anyway, after I got the three tables set up, Tom and I started sorting athletics. I spent probably 5 hours, and Tom spent probably 9 hours sorting athletics.  We had to plan it out so that as we were emptying boxes, we were making room for another table to fit.  We did it some how, but man was it complicated.  Who knew working a shipment/stock shift would require you to think this much?!?! lol anyway, after the store closed, I went back out onto the floor and started rearranging the store.  Chris (who we call ""H"" because our manager's name is Chris too) came out and helped hand me shoes over the bin tops so that I didn't have to keep going around to get the shoes.  That made the work go 100 times faster.  It also helped me to have someone to talk to, since before he came out I had been singing along with the musak ""its just another manic monday, ahh ah ah, wish it was sunday, ah ah ah, thats my fun day, ah ah ah, its just another manic monday"" - yeah good times. lol

We ended up having to move every single shoe in the womens department to make room for all of the athletic shoes we received yesterday.  What a pain.  We finally had to quit last night because a) Tom was out of room in the back to sort any more shoes and b) we couldn't start anything else on the floor because we didn't have enough time to finish it before the store opened and we didn't want to leave the store completely trashed for the customers in the morning.  So, we had to call it quits and leave.  It was a good thing though because we were all frusterated, all tired, and none of us could concentrate.  I made Kristi go to sheetz and get herself a cappaccino before I would let her drive home.  

Today they are having Heather come in and start running in women's athletics whenever the store isn't too crowded.  That way she can clear some space on the tables in the back so that I have room to sort shoes when I get there at 3:00.  I am hoping to finish sorting athletics and get as much run in as I can today.  I am just crossing my fingers that we aren't busy at all today.  If we get lucky, we'll be able to start sorting men's today, but I highly doubt that will happen unless we are really really slow on the sales floor all day.

I am so so tired today and I think I got enough sleep (I slept in until 11:30).  I think my body and my brain are trying to go on strike! I hope I get it into gear before work.  Guess I had better get moving.  I have to leave soon."

"event","well folks, tonight is another shipment night.  However, this is going to be the worst one we have ever had.  It is actually the biggest shipment our store has ever gotten all at once (for back to school, shipment is twice a week instead of once).  I was looking at the numbers for all of our district's stores and we are more than double the next highest store.  We are getting 400 cases!!! (actually 398).  There are stores in our district getting 20 or 40 cases and we are getting 400!!!  So, its going to be an all nighter for sure.  The worst part is, since it is such a big shipment, the truck driver's arrival time got switched from 9:00 AM to some time between 12:00 and 2:00PM. So, when I get to work at 3:00pm, they won't even be close to done unloading the truck.  And they are pretty sure they are going to have to sort outside atleast for today because there really isn't room in the stock room for 400 cases of shoes.  And it is REALLY hot and muggy outside today.  So, its going to be an interesting night to say the least.

Painting the house is going really well, atleast for me.  I am really really enjoying painting.  I hate scraping, but painting doesn't seem like work really (atleast not yet - we aren't very far along yet.  I might change my tune after I have had to do it for days and days on end.).  We are on the first coat of the back of the house and are a little more the halfway done.  Dad has been painting all of the eaves the past few days.  He has finished the back of the house and is working on the first coat of the first side of the house.  The hardest part is actually moving the gigantic ladder, I think.

I am tired of find paintchips on me.  How many showers do you have to take to finally get rid of them all?  By the time I get rid of them, we are going to move on to scraping another part of the house and I will be covered in them all over again! haha

well, tonight is the all nighter and tomorrow I do more shipment from 3-10 (unless a manager is willing to stay later.  In that case I will be there past 10:00).

Enjoy your day!"

1) Carol was here

2) me being up on a very high ladder, holding on for dear life and trying to pretend that I wasn't there...I don't think the wasps bought it though :)

3) me being up on a very high ladder painting the eaves of the roof and noticing that Mom, who was supposed to be holding the ladder for me, was in fact taking pictures of me instead of holding the ladder!

4) Getting to spend so much time with Dad

5) Carol was here

6) my cousin's graduation party - man he looked so grown up.  Its hard to believe he is an adult now.

7) my company dinner. . .I had a blast and really got to know one of the guys I work with on stock nights.

8) getting lots of compliments on my hair

9) Carol was here

10) getting to use the pressure washer and spraying myself head to toe with mud :)

Hope you all had great weekends.  Mine was packed full and I can't believe I fit everything in to a 48 hour period.  I had so much fun working on the house, even though it was really really hard work.

love you all!"

"event","Well, I got the day off of work today since I worked my butt off yesterday.  I fell asleep around 3:00 am, though I went to bed around 2:00.  Mom got me up around 9:30 or 9:45 and we headed to Verizon Wireless.  It turns out that due to unexpected circumstance, I STILL had to get a new phone even though they told me I wouldn't have to.  When they went to get it hooked up, the computer denied the phone because it does not have a GPS thingy in it.  There is a new law that says they can not activate any cell phone that does not have GPS. So, even though everything else about my phone was compatible, legally they could not use my phone and the computer wouldn't do it.  I was really upset since they had told me it would be no problem.  the lady they pulled over to try to figure everything out was a total weenie and didn't make any sense in what she was saying.  Mom kind of went off on her while I went to pick out a new phone (I mean, as much as mom could go off, she is not really that kind of person).  The sales lady I have been working with the past couple days came over and helped me pick out a phone. I am pretty happy with the phone I ended up getting, and was able to get a normally $299 phone for free, so I can't complain about it too much.  though it stinks having to get a new phone and having to learn how to use it when the one I already have is pretty new and has no problems.  I ended ip getting the LG VX6100 if any of you wanted to know :)  Once again, I ended up getting camera phone, not because I wanted it, but because it was the only way to get all of the other features I wanted.  I of course don't mind camera phone, I just wasn't looking for it specifically.

After verizon mom and I headed to camp and spent the rest of the day sweating our butts off there.  We ran into some distant relatives of mine who just got a camp lot really close to mine and carol's lot.  So we went to say hi and checked out their new trailer.  got some really good ideas for ways to improve grandma's trailer too.  We took turns mowing the lawns of all of our lots, and then we headed for home.

Now we are getting ready to head to Pizza hut because Dad says tonight they have a buffet.  hope you are all doing well. Enjoy the rest of your day."

"event","Well, its 1:30 and I just walked in the door.  Not only did we leave about 2 1/2 hours earlier than normal, but we FINISHED the entire shipment tonight!  I was the first person to arrive, so Chris gave me the first choice of having the day off or not.  I told him that I probably should take it off since we are painting the house and I haven't been able to help much.  Then I realize that mom was planning on going to camp tomorrow to work on Grandma's trailer, so I will probably be doing that instead of scraping paint off of the house.  Maybe I'll be doing both...not much of a day off! haha!

I can hardly think about anything but my dog right now.  The drive home went by fast because I was making plans in my head and imagining what it was going to be like to have Curly back.

My gums are killing me.  I think flossing is something I am going to have to ease back into.  I even have a little fluid filled sack by my one molar now and it hurts.

My knee only popped out of place twice tonight!! yay!!!

Jessica, since I can't reply to your post, I just wanted to let you know how sorry I was to hear about everything that happened.  I feel terrible for you.  It seems like everything has been happening to you lately.  On the plus side, you have a cool apartment with great roommies now.  We'll have to get together some this summer.

Hope you all have a wonderful wonderful wednesday."

 I can't get him yet, but Mom told me the news yesterday and I have been in total euphoria since then. 

I found a crate for him today for $30 less than I have ever seen. I started making a spot for him in the basement this afternoon, but ran out of time and had to get ready for work.  

I also went to verizon today and found out that they will let me use my old cell phone.  So tomorrow mom is going to go down there and get everything set up.  I'll let you all know my new number when I know it :)

Today is day 1 of shipment.  They said if we get enough done tonight, we won't have to stay so late tomorrow.  It was also suggested that we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow if we worked our butts off today.  So, I am going to be using my go go gadget powers tonight ;)

By the way, I love Lucy."

I just wanted to go on record and say that my parents are completely awesome people.  They shocked and amazed me today and I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy right now.

Carol is coming this weekend to visit!!!!!  I spent my morning off cleaning my room up a bit and washing sheets and towels.  If I hadn't stayed up last night watching TV land until who knows what hour, I would have gotten up earlier and gotten even more done.  The rest of the week I will be working on getting the rest of my junk cleaned up a bit.

Tomorrow mom and I are going to verizon to get me signed up with a cell phone plan.  I am probably going to do the family share plan with her.  We are hoping that I can use my old phone instead of having to get a new one.  I figured now was the time to do it since I have a little money now and just payed all my major bills.


Lucky is not doing very well today.  We think he had another seizure or stroke.  We aren't sure which but he is not in good shape today.  He ran around like crazy this morning and ran smack into a wall at a full run.  Not good.  Besides that he has been sleeping all day and breathing really funny.  

Have to leave for work in 1 hour :( 

hope you are all having a good day!"

I don't have any pictures of Lucky (my Sheltie who is like 16 years old) on here, but some (if not all of you) have seen him or pictures of him before.

Curly is my male boxer.  He is the most delightful dog I have ever met.  Here is a picture of him playing with his favorite toy:

Here is a picture of Curly and Caramel together.  Curly loves to pose for the camera (he is on the left) and Caramel is in her own little world (she is on the right).  This was taken after a particularly long period of playing and they are both rather worn out.

Here is a picture of Caramel, napping with an upside down teddy bear.  She woke up just long enough to look at me and wonder what I was doing, and then she went right back to sleep.

I will be able to sleep in and not have to wake up worrying about getting stock done tomorrow night.  I bet they won't finish tomorrow night either.  I bet I will finish for them Friday night.  

I REALLY really really miss my dogs.  I try really hard not to mention it, especially around Mom who gets all exasperated with me every time I mention it.  But sometimes it is all I can think about and I can't stop crying.  My car ride home tonight was horrible. All I could do was try to think of ways to be able to get atleast Curly.  But, that will require me to move out and I don't know where I am going or what I will be doing yet.  But I have been away from the dogs for 6 weeks and that is long enough for me.  I can't stand it.  I dream about them, I think about them while I am driving, I talk about them at work.  Expecially Curly.  I know I am not supposed to have a favorite, but man he and I just had such a strong connection.  And Caramel was always Curt's dog - she was a daddy's girl if I ever saw one.  And Curly was the same with me.  He hated to even leave my side, and here its been 6 weeks and he has been stuck outside in a strange place without me.  I am miserable...all I want to do is drive there right now and get him.  :(

I think I might take some time in the next week or so to drive to wooster.  I can meet Curt and we can exchange some of our things that got mixed up in the move.  then, I can take the dogs to the dog park and spend all afternoon with them there.  HOpefully I can see some of the people like Jessica and Kristy too while I am there.  I just want to see the dogs and make sure they are okay.  But from now on, no more spending money - just saving up so I can get a place of my own so that I can get my dog (s) back.  

I FINISHED the scrapbook of Carol and Keith's wedding today.  Completely done.  All put together and I am not changing anything anymore! Next up is my OSU graduation scrapbook.  I also realized recently that I still haven't gotten my pictures from Amber and Garrick's wedding yet.  Looks like I will have to call Amber again - DARN! 

Well, its 4:30 and I should *try* to fall asleep so that I can get some sleep/

"event","Where to start?  Okay, since dad didn't have to work this weekend, mom and dad and I decided to go to my grandmother's camp lot and work on her trailer.  I had Friday off, so I headed up there Friday afternoon and spent the whole afternoon and night cleaning the trailer and making it habitable for the weekend.  When my grandmother came to PA a couple of months ago, she tore everything out of the living room area and started working on fixing the floor by the door.  When I got there Friday, there was junk everywhere and no room to move around in there.  So, I pulled everything out on the porch and started cleaning. 

I spent hours cleaning in the bathroom because they accidentally closed the bathroom door when they winterized the trailer and everything was starting to mold.  (the walls and the ceiling most of all). I had just finished making the beds when I decided to go get dinner.  On the way to town, the sky turned black and I had to hurry back to camp to carry everything that was on the porch back inside and try to get it out of the way so people could move around inside.  What a pain.  Then, right after I put everything inside there was a huge storm and I had to spend the next few hours inside the trailer listening to the rain.  So I cleaned some more then and ate my by-then-cold dinner. 

After it stopped raining, I went for a walk all over camp and checked out my uncle's trailer and my trailer.  Both seemed to have made it through the winter just fine.  I also cleaned all of the branches off of my lot.  I headed back to the trailer and right after I got back it started raining again.  So I had to go inside and read some Harry Potter (oh darn).  Mom and dad showed up around 9:00 and we played cards until we all got too tired and went to bed.  Mom and Dad each had a bed to sleep on, but since the living room was all torn apart and junk was everywhere, I had to find a spot wide enough to fit me and a sleeping bag.  But it was fine.  I was so worn out from all of the work I did that I slept just fine.

Saturday morning we all woke up around 7:00 and Dad cooked breakfast for us.  It started raining while he was cooking, so my job was to hold an umbrella over the food (and his head).  After breakfast we put up the awning over the porch so that we could bring all of the stuff in the living room back outside so we had room to move around.  We didn't know how the awning worked, but luckily our neighbor (who's dad used to own the trailer before my grandmother) came over and helped us out.  I just hope I can remember how to put it up again in August! 

Then we started working on the trailer.  First we cleaned out all of the vents in the ceiling and man was that a chore.  Then we started on fixing the floor.  Grandma had torn all of the old carpet out and cut a hole in the floor on her last trip, so we just had to repair the hole the best we could.  Mom was cooking BBQ ribs for our holiday weekend lunch out on the grill.  All of the sudden I heard ""I have a major problem"" out of mom and ""you're going to set the neighbors on fire"" from dad.  I go running out to see what is going on, and a leg of the grill had fallen off!!!  Everything went spilling to the ground.  I ran over and tried to pick up the hot grill as best as I could.  Mom tried to stick the leg back on well enough that she could finish cooking, and I washed off all of the meat.  It ended up working out okay, but MAN what a mess.  At lunch, mom took a minute to pray and thanked God for all the fun we were having, and Dad and I both broke out in laughter and mom had to wait until all three of us were done laughing to finish the prayer.  it was really funny.  

Then I went to work and outsold everyone in the store.  I had like $3500 worth of sales in 8 hours time.  That's $437.50 worth of sales an hour! That night, being the Saturday of a holiday weekend, the store was TRASHED.  it took us a couple of hours to clean the store.  Then I drove back to camp, and accidentally woke mom and dad up.  Mom had my sleeping back all set up and ready for me to sleep in, so I immediately crashed and went to sleep.  I didn't even change my clothes.  When I woke up the next morning I saw that Dad had finished repairing the floor, had put luon (not sure how that is spelled) down, and had retiled the kitchen floor.  Dad made us breakfast again (I slept while he cooked this time!) and then we got to work on the carpet.  I had to leave for work right after dad started on the carpet, so I haven't gotten to see the final results yet. 

 I had a horrible day at work on Sunday.  It was a totally different clientel than Saturday.  I still did $2800 worth of sales, but man people were RUDE and Mean and I wanted to go home an hour after I got there.  It took us two and a half hours to clean the store after closing time.  I came home and spent a little time with my cat.  Then I sat down and watched ""The Time Machine"" with mom and dad.  I liked it, mom thought it was cheesy.  It was an old movie based off of an even older book.  Ofcourse it was cheesy.  But it was still great I thought. I went to bed after that, exhausted.  

I woke up Monday morning and went to work in a bad mood.  The clients were even worse on Monday than on Sunday.  they were all bargain shoppers on a mission.  This is just ONE of the many lines I got yesterday:
them: ""So, these shoes are regularly $100?""
me: ""Yes""
Them: ""and you have it marked all the way down to $19.99?""
me: ""that's correct""
Them: ""but there isn't any other discount? $19.99 is a lot to pay for a pair of shoes""
COME ON PEOPLE...spending $19.99 on a pair of tennis shoes is NOTHING for a good pair of shoes.  And this pair is normally $100 pair of shoes!!! 

anyway, I was grumpy and grouchy most of the day.  People were climbing walls to get shoes down when an employee was standing 5 feet away.  So then I would have to go pick up 16 pairs of shoes that they had knocked down in the process and try to put them all in the correct boxes and put them back on the wall again.  I must have put on a good game face around the clients though because I got a lot of compliments on how nice I was and how sweet it was of me to take time out when we were so busy to help them out.  So, I guess I did alright.  I think I did almost $2600 worth of sales yesterday (I missed my sales goal by $16 dollars). But, My back was killing me, my foot was killing me (for different reasons than normal), and my jaw was killing me.  I have started grinding my teeth at night and I really noticed it yesterday when I had my jaw clenched so much of the day!!!  I have never been so thankful to come home!!!  I sat down on the couch and watched a poker tournament with Dad while mom ran around and got heating pads and ice packs for me! Then we watched Jeff Foxworthy.  It was SO funny. 

Then I crashed and went to bed because I was so exausted.  I have spent most of the morning making phone calls and filling out paperwork that I was supposed to do over a week ago.  

Now I am gonna go get some lunch and head to target.  they have polo shirts on sale and I need more for work.

talk to you all later! hope you have a GREAT day!"

I am spending half of it around the house, and the other half up on my camp lot.  My parents are coming up after dad gets off work tomorrow night.  They are going to spend all day saturday at camp, but I have to work Saturday, so I only have a few hours with them.  Saturday night I am coming back home to sleep in a real bed because my back is killing me!!!  So to answer any questions, no my back and knee are not better, they are still bad, if not worse.  The knee brace helps - my knee has only hyperextended once since I started using the brace.  BUT, the brace also hurts and irritates me to death!  So, even though its better to wear the brace, I can only wear it so long before I have to rip it off.

Tonight I worked on the scrapbook of keith and carol's wedding.  Almost done, only 2 pages to go.  I am very proud of it.  I just hope I finish by the time they visit (hopefully) in June.  I wish I could post the scrapbook pages on here so you could all see them! lol ah well.  I'll be more than happy to show them off in person :)  Next is my OSU graduationg one, but I have alot to do before I can really truly dive in to that one.  Namely, get more pictures of OSU (though I may be saved thanks to dave) and get some of my pictures printed that are still just on disk.  I also want to find some good OSU stuff (stickers, etc) to put in the scrapbook.  A trip to wooster might be in order for that though.

I got shoplifted against today :( and there is nothing I can do about it.  if she really really needed some shoes I would have bought her some.  Ah well. Nothing can be done, so I need to stop thinking about it.

Had pizza for dinner tonight.  I had 4 pieces! *gasp* ah but it was SO good and I was SO hungry.  I think pizza is the best invention ever.  I just wish it was healthy ;)

alright, I am gonna go do some more research on schools.

I am exhausted and in so much pain!  I hyperextended my left knee yesterday and tonight I did it probably 50 times.  Near the end of the night, it was making like a tearing sound everytime I stood up.  It was terrible.  I think from trying to protect my knee, I tensed up my back or something because my entire back is just one big painful muscle right now.

I must get some sleep.  This is the most worn out I have been after shipping yet.  The best part is, there were 5 of us until midnight, and then four of us stayed for the last three hours. If it was just my manager and I again, I would probably have to have been there until 5 or 6am!  I am so glad the girls both decided to stay and help.

"event","I am playing fetch with my cat! no joke! It can be done.

I throw the mouse as far as I can.  Then Moose runs like a mad man to get the mouse.  The he runs back into my room with the mouse in his mouth and drops the mouse at my feet.  If I don't stop what I am doing and pick the mouse up, Moose will meow at me until I do.  So I pick it up and rethrow it and he fetches and brings it back and lays it at my feet again.  Its CRAZY.  I have never seen a cat do that!"

"event","Hmmm I can't remember everything I was planning on posting on here.  Yesterday I slept in really late.  Then I spent hours on the computer, mostly posting back and forth with Carol.  After that I mowed the lawn.  Dad pulled a muscle in his leg and can't walk very well at all,  so he took part of the day off yesterday.  We ended up watching the original Tarzan movie..the really old corny black and white one.  Oh man, were we getting a kick out of it.  

After dinner mom and I went and got icecream from a stand because we had both been craving it with all the nice weather.  Then we played MasterMind until she got tired.  I couldn't sleep, so I got online and started looking up rules to card games that I know.  I was online looking up games until 1:30 or 2:00 when I finally got tired and went to bed.  Its amazing how many games I have forgotten about!  It was nice to remember them.  I am gonna have to find people to play games with.  Curt was never much of a game player. 
That is also when I got into the riddling and decided to make a post about that.

Today I slept in kinda late, though not as late as yesterday.  I woke up and reread an article about star wars and then I just kinda laid there and played with moose.  Mom took me out to lunch on her lunch break.  I went to Long JOhn Silvers/A&W Rootbeer.  Its the second time I have been since I moved to PA.  Man was it good. The one in wooster never tasted that good.  Also, A&W rootbeer is better on tap than any other way.  My god its good! 

After lunch I went to walmart to get dishwasher soap.  They only had it in lemon or you had to get the fancy ""complete"" kind, so I ended up getting the complete kind.  I also got stickers to use in my scrapbooks, and some cards for the people at the animal hospital.  I kept finding cards that would be perfect for other people (like Carol, Amber, Dave, Nicole), but I didn't buy them at this time.  I probably should have.  They won't be there when I want to find cards for those people!  Lol ah well. I also went into the pet isle to find Moose new cat nip mice.  I ended up buying him a pack of his favorites, and then two special ones.  He LOVED the special ones and was having so much fun.  But he lost the one and came back into the bedroom.  He wandered over to the bag and found the pack of his favorites.  SO, I opened up the pack.  Since then he has been running around the house like a crazy cat with that bright fushia mouse hanging out of his mouth. 

On a side note, I LOVE my new DMB cd.  I also am missing a DMB cd :( but it wasn't the best, so its okay I guess.  

Mom was teaching second grade this morning, and there was a little kid in there who went to see star wars last night.  He said he got 2 hours of sleep.  He was so tired, he couldn't understand Bingo, which they had played 100 times before.  And he kept talking so loud because he was so tired.  Funny story.  But anyway, I was kind of surprised that a second grader went opening night.  I mean, with all of the warnings they have out there, wouldn't you want to go see it first before you let a 7 year old see it?  Anyway, that is just my thought.  

I will post answers to the trivia questions tonight as a reply to the posts they are in. 

gonna go do something else for a little while.
chao!"

"event","aat the beginning are some somewhat easier riddles for you all. Further down they get harder though! Good luck!

1). What can you catch but not throw? 

2). I have holes in my top and bottom, my left and right, and in the middle. But I still hold water. What am I? 

3). Throw it off the highest building, and I'll not break. But put me in the ocean, and I will. What am I? 

4). No sooner spoken than broken. What is it? 

5). You use a knife to slice my head and weep beside me when I am dead. What am I? 

6). I'm light as a feather, yet the strongest man can't hold me for much more than a minute. What am I? 

7). Pronounced as one letter,
And written with three,
Two letters there are,
And two only in me.
I'm double, I'm single,
I'm black, blue, and gray,
I'm read from both ends,
And the same either way.
What am I? 

8). At night they come without being fetched, and by day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?

9). What walks on four legs in the morning, two at mid-day, and three in the evening? (I don't like this one very much)

10). Bright as diamonds,
Loud as thunder,
Never still,
A thing of wonder.

11). Three lives have I.
Gentle enough to soothe the skin,
Light enough to caress the sky,
Hard enough to crack rocks.

12). General Gasslefield, accused of high treason, is sentenced to death by the court-martial. He is allowed to make a final statement, after which he will be shot if the statement is false or will be hung if the statement is true. Gasslefield makes his final statement and is released. What did he say?

13). A long, long time ago, two Egyptian camel drivers were fighting for the hand of the daughter of the sheik of Abbudzjabbu. The sheik, who liked neither of these men to become the future husband of his daughter, came up with a clever plan: a race would determine who of the two men would be allowed to marry his daughter. And so the sheik organized a camel race. Both camel drivers had to travel from Cairo to Abbudzjabbu, and the one whose camel would arrive last in Abbudzjabbu, would be allowed to marry the sheik's daughter. 
The two camel drivers, realizing that this could become a rather lengthy expedition, finally decided to consult the Wise Man of their village. Arrived there, they explained him the situation, upon which the Wise Man raised his cane and spoke four wise words. Relieved, the two camel drivers left his tent: they were ready for the contest! What four words were the wise man's solution?

14). What fastens two people yet touches only one?

15). I can sizzle like bacon, 
I am made with an egg, 
I have plenty of backbone, but lack a good leg, 
I peel layers like onions, but still remain whole, 
I can be long, like a flagpole, yet fit in a hole, 
What am I?"

"event","1) what gets wetter and wetter the more it dries?

2.) You throw away the outside and cook the inside. Then you eat the outside and throw away the inside. What did you eat? 

3.) what goes around the world, but stays in a corner?

4.) Give me food, and I will live; give me water, and I will die. What am I? 

5.) The man who invented it doesn't want it. The man who bought it doesn't need it. The man who needs it doesn't know it. What is it? 

6.)What can run but never walks, has a mouth but never talks, has a head but never weeps, has a bed but never sleeps? 

7.) I'm the part of the bird that's not in the sky. I can swim in the ocean and yet remain dry. What am I?

To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball.

I serve by being devoured.
Thin, I am quick; fat, I am slow.
Wind is my foe.
What am I? 

14.) What does man love more than life?
Fear more than death or mortal strife?
What do the poor have, what the rich require,
And what contented men desire?
What does the miser spend, the spendthrift save,
And all men carry to their graves? 

15.) When I am filled,
I can point the way;
When I am empty,
Nothing moves me.
I have two skins,
One without and one within.
What am I?"

"event","Just so you all know, I got out of work at 11:00!!! on shipment night!!! we finished ALL of it.  My shipment supervisor was out on the sale floor most of the night, so he only had like an hour really of putting shoes where the go.  We had almost everything done by 9:00 when the store closed.  He went to the back to get more shoes and we already had them all out on the floor, they just needed put away! It was GREAT.  YOu have no idea how great it felt to see the look on his face.  He complimented me and how fast I am getting.  It is the last week ( think) that we do shipment together.  After this Kristy takes over being in charge of shipment. 

It is neat because one of the kids I work with I really just got to know at Dave and Busters on Sunday, and starting today he will only be working shipments.  So we got to goof off in the back together most of the night.  I am so glad that I got to know him at D&Bs before we got stuck together in the back room all night.  That would have been awkward I think.  Anyway, I am glad that he is staying on board to do shipment even though he started another full time job during the days.  That way I still get to see him and get to know him better.  

I just realized in talking to mom today just how busy my June 12th weekend is going to be.  Carol and Keith are coming to Visit, so I took off work Saturday and Sunday.  My cousin Chad's graduation party is Sunday afternoon.  My next work dinner party is Sunday night. (its completely different and unrelated to the one we just had, and its really weird that they are so close to eachother since we won't have another one probably all year). And in between all of that I have to find time to paint the house and spend time with Carol and Keith.  Its the only weekend I have any plans and it is SO crowded.  Well, ofcourse, I was only able to make plans because I took two days in a row off of work.  Its a bummer though that Dave is graduating that weekend because there is no way I will make it.  Also, I think jessica wanted to get together that weekend, but that won't be happening either. 

Well, I just spent almost an hour writing emails and this post, so I had better get to bed now.

hope you all have a wonderful wednesday!"

"event","I must say I have got really creative recently. I just managed to finish doing a wooden model of sailing boat, it was easier as I previously thought. Anyway, I'm pretty proud of my marine baby :D. Now I have to think how it should be painted. So far I have two ideas, one is obvious - typical colour for a boat. Second is to make it psychedelic hippie ship, with bright colors and huge flowers and dragonflies on it. Anyway, we'll see. Maybe I have another ideas, right now I'm thinking about something dark - grey and dark green, maybe some feathers. Yay. Yesterday I did some drawings, kitty of course. ;).
Tomorrow, I'm going to do some wire sculpture. Angel with scorpio tail. Hope it will look exactly as its project in my head."

"event","Ok, fine, as usual I have nothing interesting to say.
Anyway, because I don't have anything better to do, I'll write something about my boring life.
First of all my computer broke and guy who was fixing it said that my hard drive must have been dropped (I have never tried to fix it by myself so STUPID people who were preparing that computer for me must have put broken hard drive).
Second, I'm home alone and I must admit that I'm bit bored because almost everyone went away somewhere, happily one of my best friends will be soon here so I hope we'll have some fun in the city.
Anyway I promised myself to do some reading till she comes back. And so far it is mostly cooking recipies that I read. ;)
And....
End of ideas.

Why I always have so much to say but when I start writing I loose almost every idea of what I should say.

D'oh"

"event","I haven't written anything yesterday, I guess but I may be wrong because I have got totally absentminded recently. Anyway, first of all I'm looking for some summer job, just to keep myself occupied and all :D. I must say it isn't easy to find one, there is always something that either I don't like or my would-be boss doesn't like. E.g. no driving licence or no part time jobs. :( 
I hope I manage to find something I will be satisfied with and my boss will be satisfied with me.
And, just to remind myself I have to wake up early. I really have to. Today I slept till 1 PM, I even don't know why (no party, the day before), I feel damn ashamed.
And [No. 2] says: tomorrow, some special reading to do. No computer games!!!
You're warned!!!"

"event","People usually think that whan they do something for the first time, it must be special. I don't know wheter this first blog entry should be special or not, maybe it is because my carelessness I've been infected for some time...
Anyway, I still think if starting the blog is a good think. First, because it is like stripping online. Wait, wait, it is like this but only if you have anything interesting to say... and here we go, problem number two, my life ain't interesting :(.
Anyway, let's see what happens."

<P>Ground Rules: The first player of this ""game"" starts with the topic ""5 Weird Habits Of Yours"" and people who get tagged need to write an LJ entry about their 5 quirky habits as well as state this rule clearly. In the end, you need to choose the next 5 people to be tagged and list their names.<BR></P>
<P>1.&nbsp; I just can't seem to stop chewing my cuticles.&nbsp; It's SO annoying!</P>
<P>2.&nbsp; My face twitches.&nbsp; Like, my eyes... I occassionally blink really hard with one eye, then the other and then flex my cheek muscles or wiggle my nose.&nbsp; If I get conscious of doing it, then I suddenly feel the urge to keep doing it on purpose.&nbsp; Especially if I'm talking to someone face-to-face and I have to focus, I feel my face want to twitch.&nbsp; I try to hold it back, but sometimes it happens... just a little... I feel so retarded when I do it!</P>
<P>3.&nbsp; I always count steps.&nbsp; Going up or down.&nbsp; Even when I know how many there are.&nbsp; I count each one in my head&nbsp;as I step on it.&nbsp; Isn't that a form of obsessive compulsive?</P>
<P>4.&nbsp; I play with my pimples (I HATE PMS ACNE!!!).&nbsp; I just can't stop myself.&nbsp; I'm going to leave scars, I just know it...</P>
<P>5.&nbsp; Ok, I have this thing about eye brows... I can't STAND when they are messy!&nbsp; So, you'll constantly see me rubbing mine, making sure they are in place, especially putting on or taking off a hoodie or when I've washed my face.&nbsp; I'll even fix Corey's if they are messy.&nbsp; I think it annoys him, lol...</P>

<P> <STRONG><FONT color=#000099>Recognizing a stroke</FONT></STRONG></P>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3</DIV>
<DIV>hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke...totally. He</DIV>
<DIV>said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed and getting</DIV>
<DIV>to the patient within 3</DIV>
<DIV>hours which is tough.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ff0000>RECOGNIZING A STROKE</FONT> - A true story</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Susie is recouping at an incredible pace for someone with a massive</DIV>
<DIV>stroke all because Sherry saw Susie stumble - - that is the key that</DIV>
<DIV>isn't mentioned below -and then she asked Susie the 3 questions. So</DIV>
<DIV>simple - - this literally saved Susie's life - - Some angel sent it to</DIV>
<DIV>Suzie's friend and they did just what it said to do. Suzie failed all</DIV>
<DIV>three</DIV>
<DIV>so then 9-1-1 was called.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Even though she had normal blood pressure readings and did not appear</DIV>
<DIV>to be a stroke as she could converse to some extent with the</DIV>
<DIV>Paramedics they took her to the hospital right away. Thank God for the</DIV>
<DIV>sense to remember the ""3"" steps. Read and Learn! Sometimes symptoms of</DIV>
<DIV>a stroke are difficult to identify.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke</DIV>
<DIV>victim may suffer brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize</DIV>
<DIV>the symptoms of a stroke.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ff0000>Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ff0000>simple</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ff0000>questions:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. *Ask the individual to SMILE.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2. *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3. *Ask the person to SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently) (ie . It is</DIV>
<DIV>sunny out today)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If he or she has trouble with any of these tasks, call 9-1-1</DIV>
<DIV>immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After discovering that a group of non-medical volunteers could</DIV>
<DIV>identify facial weakness, arm weakness and speech problems,</DIV>
<DIV>researchers urged the general public to learn the three questions.</DIV>
<DIV>They presented their conclusions at the American Stroke Asso! ciation'</DIV>
<DIV>s annual meeting last February. Widespread use of this test could</DIV>
<DIV>result in prompt diagnosis and treatment of the stroke and prevent</DIV>
<DIV>brain damage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this e-mail sends it to 10</DIV>
<DIV>people, you can bet that at least one life will be saved.</DIV>

<P>So I did.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, the lady said she'd turn the phone's back on as a curtiousy (GOD BLESS HER!) as long as we paid $50 dollars on Friday and the rest ($215) by the 28th.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, I knew Corey would just be getting up, if he hadn't pulled his lazy self out of bed yet.&nbsp; I called his phone and after two rings I hear him pick up, then hang up.&nbsp; Erm.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Suure.&nbsp; So I call back and he's like ""Hello?"".&nbsp; It was cute.&nbsp; He was so confused!&nbsp; I'm just like, ""Why'd you hang up on me?"" He said, ""Cause my alarm just went off and I thought that it went off again with a different ringer."" Hehehe... he's so funny.&nbsp; </P>
<P>He was like ""why the hell are the phones back on?"" I said, ""Cause I'm good!"" So I told him what happened, and he was so proud of me!&nbsp; And of course I had to tell him about what happened to me last night with the Prayer of the Day thing.&nbsp; Which I know he was impressed with, he just didn't say.&nbsp; But I could tell.</P>
<P>A while later we were texting and he says, ""I'm glad you got the phone back on i felt lost all night and when i pooped speaking of which i got to""... okay so I didn't need to give the <EM>entire</EM> message, but alas... see he's talking about the fact that we text throughout the late late evening and he always texts me when he poops.&nbsp; It's ritual.&nbsp; I think he needs me to talk him through it.&nbsp; It's a comfort thing. *snort* Sorry, we're just twisted, one might say!&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

The two survivors, not <BR>&nbsp;knowing what else to do, agreed that they had no other recourse but to pray to <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;However, to find out whose prayer was more powerful, they agreed to divide the territory between them and stay on opposite sides of the island. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;The first thing they prayed for was food. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;The next morning, the first man saw a fruit-bearing tree on his side of the land, and he was able to eat its fruit. The other man's parcel of land <BR>&nbsp;remained barren so he went hungry. <BR><BR>&nbsp;After a week, the first man was lonely and he decided to pray for a wife. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;The next day, another ship was wrecked, and the only survivor was a woman who swam to his side of the land. On the other side of the island, there was <BR>&nbsp;nothing. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;Soon the first man prayed for a house, clothes, and more food. The next day, like magic, all of these were given to him. However, the second man still had <BR>&nbsp;nothing.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;Finally, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife could leave the island. In the morning, he found a ship docked at his side of the island. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;The first man boarded the ship with his wife and decided to leave the second man on the island. He considered the other man unworthy to receive God's <BR>&nbsp;blessings, since none of his prayers had been answered. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from heaven booming, ""Why are you leaving your companion on the island?"" <BR><BR>&nbsp;""My blessings are mine alone, since I was the one who prayed for them,"" the first man answered. ""His prayers were all unanswered and so he does not <BR>&nbsp;deserve anything."" <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;""You are mistaken!"" the voice rebuked him. ""He had only one prayer, which I &nbsp;answered. If not for that, you would not have received any of my blessings."" <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;""Tell me,"" the first man asked the voice, ""What did he pray for that I should owe him anything?"" <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;The voice answered, ""He prayed that all your prayers be answered."" <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;For all we know, our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers alone, but those of another praying for us. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;With obedience, come blessings. My prayer for you today is that all your prayers are answered. Be blessed. </SPAN></FONT>"

<P>*throws a hissy fit tantrum like a&nbsp;2-year old brat*</P>
<P>I have a Share Talk plan with Corey and Tasha (it's in Tasha's name).&nbsp; Corey and I have been paying the bill since Tasha is out of work due to pregnancy.&nbsp; Well, the first bill after we added Corey's phone to the line was 416 dollars and it's been a bitch trying to get that down.&nbsp; Then our second bill was like $285.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, Tasha called customer service last week and told them we'd be in to pay off the past due of the $416 bill which was $216.&nbsp; The woman said that would be fine and&nbsp;I think she said to make other arrangements on the next time we'd be in to make a payment.&nbsp; Well, I never made arrangements just a payment ($230).&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, I'm going to be applying for a stupid loan I&nbsp;shouldn't be taking out, just so I can pay our past due and get the phones back on.&nbsp; I'm hoping though, that I can get enough so that I can pay&nbsp;what's left on the cell phones&nbsp;($265)&nbsp;and pay off my brides maid gown ($88.25), which comes in this weekend and I need to get fitted and have alterations done before Tasha and Chris' wedding.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>Have you ever had an infected pore in the crack of your butt right underneath your tail bone?&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; *grins sarcastically*&nbsp; Sarah has!&nbsp; My Lord...</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""OOOWWW!!!!!!!""> </P>
<P>Okay, so around January this year I had one, and it hurt horribly.&nbsp; I couldn't sit against it unless I was against something very soft.&nbsp; It got pretty swollen and after about a week or two the skin broke and it began to puss and bleed.&nbsp; I finally saw my doc about it right after it started to drain.&nbsp; He assumed that it was an infected pore, and since it was draining he gave me a box of Omnicef, an antibiotic that best treats bacterial infections.&nbsp; He said to come back sooner next time if it happened again.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, between then and now I've had a few minor irritations in that area but nothing like that.&nbsp; That is until about four days ago.&nbsp; I felt the irritation and it began to balloon up.&nbsp; It literally doubled in size over last night alone.&nbsp; Night before last I hardley slept, for I was tossing and turning all night.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep on my back, only my sides and I can never lay in one position for more than half an hour unless I'm out cold, so the pain of switching sides kept me awake all night.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Then yesterday I went to work and it didn't feel very nice, I was wincing all night, but I toughed it out.&nbsp; When I got home, I showered and cleaned the area very well.&nbsp; It didn't even hurt to spray the water on it and it was just a little sensative washing it, but it was fine.&nbsp; No sooner did I lay down did it suddenly seem to flare up.&nbsp; I wasn't allowed on my right side at all, the pressure was excruciating.&nbsp; But even on my left side I couldn't find anything comfortable enough to fall asleep on.&nbsp; So, in tears, I pull myself up (I only have a matress on the floor so its very low), grab a pillow and my blanket and head for the couch.&nbsp; That was the only place I could get comfortable the day before.&nbsp; It's a very lumpy couch and it seemed to ease the pressure on the pore, as opossed to my bed which was too normal to lay on.&nbsp; Was wierd.&nbsp; Still, I was in too much pain and too uncomfortable.&nbsp; My body would not allow me to fall asleep.&nbsp;</P>
<P>About 1:30 Tasha came out of her room (pregnancy insomnia you know.&nbsp; Not that she doesn't have normal insomnia anyway).&nbsp; So we were up suffering in pain together for the next four and a half hours.&nbsp; It was nice to at least have company and get my mind off it a little.&nbsp; But I felt bad that she couldn't sleep either.&nbsp; She's been missing a shit load of it.</P>
<P>But, I finally dozed off around 5am and was asleep til 6:30.&nbsp; I had to&nbsp;pee.&nbsp; But more importantly, I had to get up because my left side was in so much pain from having the constant pressure on the same areas because I couldn't move around and adjust myself.&nbsp; So, when I struggled to get up, in tears, moaning and groaning and yelping (alot) between my soreness and that sore on my ass! I had to loosen up a little before I could lay back down, in the same position, and sleep another hour and a half before I had to get up and readjust.&nbsp; Then when I woke up about 8am, I knew my mom would be up getting ready for work.&nbsp; She was to be done at 2pm and take me to see the doctor at 3.&nbsp; Then I'd go into work at 4.&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; Not after that night of torture!&nbsp; I called her, in tears, telling her about it and had her let our managers know I wouldn't be in today!&nbsp; </P>
<P>So.&nbsp; I went back to bed and woke up around 10:30.&nbsp; Then I slept a little over an hour more (after readjusting, in tears) before Tasha came out to take her insulin and eat breakfast.&nbsp; She layed back down 'round noon and I dozed off til 1:30.&nbsp; Then I finally got up and slowly made my way, in tears, to get ready for my appointment.&nbsp; </P>
<P>When mom came to pick me up, I was wondering why I was able to climb into the van so easily (well, easier than I thought I'd be able to&nbsp;anyway, it was still extremely painful).&nbsp; Then we got to the doc's office and I didn't think I'd be able to sit.&nbsp; Well, I still had to sit funky, but it again wasn't as painful.&nbsp; Mom and I went into our room, the nurse took my stats and I was good.&nbsp; The nurse gave me a robe and had me just take off my jeans.&nbsp; Well, no sooner did I take off those jeans, did I start yelping in pain again.&nbsp; I was wearing my thicker jeans (these ones that actually sit above my belly button for some reason) and something about the stiff material was easing the pressure off of the sore.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, the doc checked me out and decided that there wasn't enough puss at the surface yet to slice 'er open and drain 'er (thank GOD!).&nbsp; So, he gave me a shot of antibiotic as a jump start and then the Omnicef to take for the next ten days.&nbsp; And between my tension pain and the pain from the sore, he gave me fifteen Vicaden! WOOHOO!!&nbsp; I just hope it lasts long enough for the pain to ease up considerably.&nbsp; I can hardly move when it's that painful.&nbsp; I have today, Thursday and Friday off from work, so I'm praying that it will clear up enough to be able to go back on Saturday.&nbsp; Here's to hoping.&nbsp;</lj-cut>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So.&nbsp; That's my sob story, and I'm stickin' to it!</P>"

"event","I've always known Corey was self-serving, but it really hit me tonight just how deep that really goes.  I have this wonkey sore on my backside that has been giving me problems and when it swells up it hurts SO bad I can barely sit or lay without being in excruciating pain.  He text me tonight when he was at work and all he said was ""blah"".  My reply was telling him how much pain I'm in and that I need to really see the doc about it.  His reply was, ""I'm really sorry I am but I'm not in the mood.""  Ok.  WTF?!?!?!?!?!   

I'm always supporting him, putting all of my faith in him, encouraging him when no one else cares and I'm over here in pain and he says he's not in the fucking mood?!?!?!?!?!?!  Thanks for the fucking love man.  It was hard to reply to that with out completely freaking out.  He makes it so hard for me to be a good influence and to do Gods will when he's SO unbelievably selfish!  I was just speechless.  I said ""Um.  Ok.  What?""  And he starts bitching about work and the fact that he's ""losing"" his mind because of some of the guys there and their bullshit.  Same old shit, different day.  He's letting them get to him.  He's perfectly secure in his fucking job and he's letting some snot nose frusturate him.  GET. OVER. IT!  Your friend,,, you know ME!!!  OVER HERE!! I'M HURTING!!!!  LOTS OF FUCKING PAIN OWIE!  Can we for five MINUTES pat Sarah on the head and tell her everythings going to be okay?

But instead, I'm over here trying to convince him that he needs to stop letting this guy get him so worked up.  Corey just needs to open his mouth and tell him to back off, but no he can't, why?  Because he ""hates conflict"".  Well too fucking bad.  STOP BEING A FUCKING COWARD YOU PANSY ASS HOLE!!!!!!!~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Yeah.

I'm upset.

I just can't yell at him.  Because it won't do any good.  And then we'll be back at square one.  I just have to trust that God will allow me to say what needs to be said in a loving manner and hold my tongue when I want to say nasty derogative things to him...I know people might think I'm letting him push me around, walk on me, use me, whatever.  But I'm not.  I'm aware of his child-like selfish immaturity.  He's never been taught how to grow up.  I learned tonight when I was reading Rick Warren's ""The Purpose-Driven Life"" that most adults never truly grow up, meaning spiritually, so they are always trying to prospure for the greater good of themselves... always looking out for numero uno.  So, I realized that that is what God has been doing with me.  Showing me how to grow spiritually, through His Word and by acting upon His Word.  Living Faith.  That's what it is.  I'm learning and growing everyday and I believe that Corey and I are continually being guided toward each other so that I can continue practicing Living Faith and so that Corey can learn what I have so that he too may switch gears and begin growing.  I just have to hang on and trust God.  Trust that He has us in this situation for that reason and that in due time, Corey will indeed wake up.  I pray everyday, that he will.  Because right now he doesn't realize how happy he will be.  If he just trusts the God he believes in and lives his life for Him.

The  European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will
be  the official language of the European Union rather than German, which  was
the other possibility.

 

As part of the negotiations, the British  Government conceded that English
spelling had some room for improvement and  has accepted a 5- year phase-in
plan that would become known as  ""Euro-English"".

 

In the first year, ""s"" will replace the soft ""c"".  Sertainly, this will make 
the sivil servants jump with joy.

 

The hard  ""c"" will be dropped in favour of ""k"". This should klear up
konfusion, and  keyboards kan have one less  letter.

 

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when  the
troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with ""f"". This will make words  like
fotograf 20% shorter.

 

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the  new spelling kan be expekted  to
reach the stage where more komplikated changes are  possible.

 

Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters  which have always
ben a deterent to akurate speling.

 

Also, al wil  agre that the horibl mes of the silent ""e"" in the languag is
disgrasful and  it should go away.

 

By the 4th yer people wil be reseptiv to steps such  as replasing ""th"" with
""z"" and ""w"" with ""v"".

 

During ze fifz yer, ze  unesesary ""o"" kan be dropd from  vords kontaining ""ou""
and after ziz fifz yer, ve vil hav a reil sensibl  riten styl.

 

Zer vil be no mor trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find  it ezi tu
understand ech oza. Ze drem of a united urop vil finali kum  tru.

 

Und efter ze fifz yer, ve vil al be speking German like zey vunted  in ze
forst plas.

 

If zis mad you smil, pleas pas on to oza  pepl."

<P>Two twins are talking in their mother's womb.<BR>- Do you believe in life after birth?<BR>- Of course there is life after birth! Maybe our present life is just a preparation for life after birth.<BR>- That is nonsense. There is no life after birth. What would such life look like?<BR>- I don't know exactly, but I'm pretty sure that there would be much more light, and that we will be able to walk with our legs and eat with our mouths.<BR>- That's utter rubbish. You know it's impossible to walk. Eating with mouth, hah! We have umbilical cord for that. I tell you, there is no life after birth.<BR>- The cord is too short. I'm certain there's something after birth. Something entirely different than what we have now.<BR>- No one has returned from the born. Life ends after birth. Besides, life is nothing else than living in this dark environment.<BR>- Well, I'm not sure what is life after birth like, but in any case we will meet our mom. She will take care of us.<BR>- Mom!? You believe in Mom? And according to you, where is this supposed Mom?<BR>- All around us, of course. Thanks to her we live, without her we wouldn't exist.<BR>- I don't believe it. I've never seen Mom, and I'm assured that she doesn't exist.<BR>- Possibly. But sometimes, when we're completely still, you can her singing. You know, I'm assured that after birth, life is only beginning...<BR></P>"

Actually tomorrow, Tuesday, September 27th, is Corey's birthday (YAY!!!).  It's the first in a very busy season of birthdays and holidays!  The expensive time of year that makes me feel worthless because I can't get a damn thing for most people and dollar store crap for everyone else.  Alas, such is the life of a fast food employee... ah, but not for long.

So, Corey will be the big 2-0 tomorrow!  We are going to a movie and dinner, than he has an orientation for his HSED.  It's his high school diploma.  It's like a GED but it looks better.  I'm very excited about it.  When he gets it, we're going to be taking an EMT course together.  Yep.  We're going to be Paramedics!  He really wants to go in the spring so he's going to try to squeeze in all of his exams before the end of December.  Then we just have to work out financial aid.  God Willing, we'll get it!

So yep, I'm very excited to actually be going back to school and soon I'll be doing something better.  I hope this all works out..."

I just want to throw up.&nbsp; What the HELL is wrong with people!&nbsp; It seems a rather stupid question from a Christian... I know about human corruption and satan and demons and all that goes with it... but everyday I continue to be stunned by utter nerve.&nbsp; Nerve in no sense couragous, only pittiful and sad and going against everything God wants from us.&nbsp; These people will die.&nbsp; These people will die and not rise, because what is Freedom to them?&nbsp; They imprison fellow man, man that they are no better than on earth.&nbsp; So after death, they will be treated no better.&nbsp; Do unto others as you would unto you... </P>

"event","<P>It's weird how much Corey and I can goof around in a way that we couldn't before.&nbsp; I mean we can make sexual jokes about each other and it's no longer taboo.&nbsp; But sometimes I'll say something and I think Corey takes it the wrong way like he think's I'm coming on to him when&nbsp;just a moment before he'll have said something ten times as raunchy or even flirtatious.&nbsp; It's like, he'll take it the wrong way and suddenly clam up like he thought I wanted something from him... and I've told him that I don't have feelings for him anymore and he says he believes me, but for him to act that way shows that he thinks I still have feelings... like he's okay with me having them, he just isn't ready for me to express them, like it will take time before he's ready.&nbsp; Because if he knew I have these feelings and it bothered him, how could we have gotten as close as we have lately?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Hmphf.&nbsp; I just don't like the games, but I know they are necessary.&nbsp; If I want to break down any of Coreys walls, I just have to be diligent.&nbsp; And dammit, I'm going to be.&nbsp; I love him too fucking much to give up.&nbsp; We've been through too much and Gods brought Corey back to me too many times to just give up like some hopeless fool who never had enough faith to fill a dixie cup.&nbsp; Well, I'll tell you now, I have more faith than a gazillion dixie cups and I believe I am the one who has been chosen to see Corey through all his crap.&nbsp; I see him growing everyday.&nbsp; God and I maybe the only ones to recognize it now, but one day, everyone will see.&nbsp; They'll see that Corey wasn't a hopeless case and that with a little more DILIGENT faith from his friends, he could pull through.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sometimes it just takes some a little longer than the rest to get it.&nbsp; That's when its OUR job to show them some direction.&nbsp; Gently prodding them toward the light.&nbsp; Corey just needs a lot more time to get it.&nbsp; And I'm going to continue to show him the patience he so desperately needs.</P>
<P>Corey will get it yet.&nbsp; And I know.&nbsp; I just know it's going to all work out.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>Man.&nbsp; It's been awhile.&nbsp; Well, it's been so long because I moved out of mom's place at the beginning of August (WWOOOOO!!!!).&nbsp; I haven't had computer access until Wednesday because that was when my computer finally showed up from Blue Hippo.&nbsp; So, here I am.&nbsp; Alive and kickin'!</P>

<P>I have to say, it's been a pretty amazing month.&nbsp; Firstly, I finally feel free away from mom and Kim.&nbsp; I mean that's sad to say but, with my mother, she's just much too overbearing and doesn't let me be me.&nbsp; She's so judgemental and while she's a Believer, she doesn't lead a Christian life.&nbsp; While I'm struggling to learn how to live the best Christian life I possibly can.&nbsp; She's over there blowing her money on weed, cigarettes and crap and wondering why we just can't seem to get along.&nbsp; As for my sister, it's not like we have big differences like my mother and I, Kim and I just can't live together.&nbsp; Our personalities clash so ruefully.&nbsp; We love each other to death and I'll kick anyone's ass who mistreats her.&nbsp; We just are the type that would as soon strangle each other.&nbsp; Only we can beat each other up, no one else can.&nbsp; That type of sibling relationship.</P>

<P>Anyway.&nbsp; Then I've got my relationship with Corey.&nbsp; Which suddenely has become the friendship that I wanted from him a long time ago.&nbsp; I've finally grown enough that I don't push my feelings on him, I instead use them to give him the things he so desperately needs.&nbsp; Kindness, understanding, freedom, attention, and the kind of unconditional love that he wont push away.&nbsp; It's a fine art being subtle with Corey and actually getting through to him.&nbsp; It takes true Grace from Jesus to pull off what I've done in just a month.&nbsp; If God continues to Bless me, I can only imagine how far I'll get in the coming months.&nbsp; </P>

<P>As much as I love Corey.&nbsp; As deeply in love with him as I am, I finally realize whats at stake if I don't play my cards right.&nbsp; Especially now that I see that I can have the friendship with Corey that I've always wanted.&nbsp; Of course I'd love to have much more, but that's only if that's what's meant to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P>Lately, Corey's just been so nice to me.&nbsp; I mean he actually speaks to me with respect. It's pretty amazing considering he would only ever talk down to me before.&nbsp; He's really come along way, I only wish that he'd show more respect to everyone, just to be the better person whether or not the other party deserves his respect.&nbsp; I just think he's showing me respect now because of how much I have given him, I mean I went as far as to tell Corey that I respected him and since then things have been different.&nbsp; I tried it out on him as a test once because I'd heard about it on a Christian talk show, that men want respect from woman the way woman want love from men.&nbsp; So, if you just take a moment to verbally tell them that you respect them for things they do, they will positively react to it.&nbsp; Well, it certainly worked on Corey and we aren't even in an intimate relationship.&nbsp; Praise the Big Man!</P>

<P>I've even been at peace lately with my feelings for Corey.&nbsp; Thanks to Jesus I can reserve them and use them for when he needs them in his own way.&nbsp; I've also been this positive influence on him that he seriously needs.&nbsp; Nikki was saying that God may want to use me as an example of the peace He brings and Corey will want it when he sees what I've got.&nbsp; I've gotten him to read.&nbsp; He's reading the Harry Potter series (yes I know, go me!).&nbsp; He usually works late into the night, so he's hungry when he gets off and he'll usually drag me to the Oasis.&nbsp; It's always real nice to go.&nbsp; We'll just talk, like adults.&nbsp; To do that with Corey is deep man.&nbsp; </P>

<P>He tries so much to hold on the his teenage years.&nbsp; Corey doesn't want to grow up.&nbsp; At least he didn't, but I think it's finally sinking in that he has too.&nbsp; It comes fast and it's hard, but it's really not as bad as people make it seem.&nbsp; If you're mature and have a strong, courageous spirit.&nbsp; There's nothing God can't get you through and if you know how to chose your friends, you'll always have someone to help you.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Corey has a really good heart and good intentions, he's just confused when it comes to exectuting his emotions and intentions.&nbsp; He gets mixed up, scared, and tries to stay inside his shell.&nbsp; But all he needs is a bit of direction, a little faith from a good friend, and a whole lot of love.&nbsp; He be aiight!</P>

<P>He was here last night and he was being so goofy.&nbsp; He was in a really good mood.&nbsp; Well, I got a few pics of him and I realize I haven't posted any of him on here yet.&nbsp; Some of you have seen him, some haven't.&nbsp; For those who have, he's lost a bit of weight!&nbsp; So, here's my Corey!:</P>

I also love all the shippyness.  My very favorites at last... I knew Harry and Ginny would be together.  Hello, it's just fitting for him to be with a Weasley.  That's his family.  And when he marrys Ginny and Hermione marrys Ron, the trio will all be related! Woot! (Yeah I guess that did sound abit incestish, but really it's not)"

<P>I'm a sad, sad woman...</P>

"event","<P>You know.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So first, my sister deceides I'm too much of a bitch to get Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince for me.&nbsp; Even though, before she got&nbsp;a job,&nbsp;I always tried to include her, I always bought her shit and took her to lunch all the while she was being a cunt rag.&nbsp;&nbsp;She said she was&nbsp;getting&nbsp;the book&nbsp;for me, but we're all having issues so she won't.&nbsp; Bitch. </P>
<P>Then, I went to donate plasma today so that I could get HBP, but my himaticrit (sp??) level was one number below what they will except for a donation.&nbsp; That's my iron, essentially.&nbsp; I've always been borderline, but usually it's a few days before my period... I had&nbsp;my cycle&nbsp;like two weeks ago.&nbsp; Fuckers.</P>
<P>So, this means I have to wait for my book.&nbsp; Till Wednesday or Thursday.&nbsp; DAMMIT!&nbsp; Meanwhile, Matt has his copy under my nose all day.&nbsp; And just to get by, I allow him to tell me a little bit about what's going on.&nbsp; It's fucking official.&nbsp; I'm an addict.&nbsp; Addicted.&nbsp; Seriously, I was like fiening.&nbsp; Ask Matt, Tasha, Chris AND Corey.&nbsp; They're all trying to tell me it's just a book... not. to. me.&nbsp; *feeble smile*</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Ummm... More Corey anyone?""> On another note.&nbsp; I've got issues.&nbsp; Someone please tell me why Corey won't just leave me and my life alone.&nbsp; Thing is, Tasha and I both sort of have the same problem with him.&nbsp; We know about all the lieing and deception and yet we can't seem to stop taking his crap.&nbsp; </P>
<P>He's got these friends Brian and Sherry, who are married.&nbsp; Brian as it turns out is bisexual.&nbsp; Sherry either doesn't know this or is blinded and doesn't care.&nbsp; Not to mention Corey thinks Brian is cheating on Sherry.&nbsp; Then Corey keeps telling me how it's none of his business and he won't tell Sherry about it (he offers all the info to me, might I add, I'm not asking at all).&nbsp; So, me being the stubborn Christian I am, tell him that it IS his business if he sees something like that going on.&nbsp; Corey said he didn't know for sure if Brian was sleeping around, so he couldn't really say anything anyway, which I then agreed with, but said, had he known for sure, it was his business and he seemingly agreed.&nbsp; PFFTTT!!!</P>
<P>This is where Sarah kicks herself.&nbsp; I was at Corey's house today and as I was laying in his bed waiting for him to get out of the shower, I tried watching TV but I couldn't work it and rather than figure it out, I spot his journal.... shit... I know I shouldn't read it, because not only is that so wrong privacy wise, but it's Corey and I always find something disturbing.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; In that journal he said he shouldn't have done with Brian what he did... ""I just wanted my dick sucked""... For the Love of Jesus.... My God.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Please help him.&nbsp; Forgive me too.&nbsp; Then it goes on to read about the romance party that Tasha was invited to (which took place this afternoon) and Tasha drug me to.&nbsp; Well, apparently the hostess told Corey he could come but he told her that *I* didn't want him too.&nbsp; All I said was that I wouldn't go because that would just be weird and wrong... because anyone who knows, knows how I feel truly about that stuff (stuff = gay, specifically Corey)... It bothers me, not in a prejudice way, but in a deeply emotion and private way.&nbsp; Corey either doesn't get that or rightly care.&nbsp; Although, I'm sorry if I did say I didn't want him to come, because I think I may have, but really, I just wouldn't have gone if he had.&nbsp; So, back onto the journal thing, he also said he wanted to get some toys because he ""wants a cock in my ass so bad"".&nbsp; *shudder*&nbsp; I can't believe I'm even reliving this.&nbsp; I already told Tasha, but I just have to purge my mind...</P>
<P>The reason these things hurt me so much is because what we read in Corey's journal is a person that no one knows.&nbsp; Even then, I have a feeling that what's in that journal isn't the real Corey either.&nbsp; Sometimes he gets sick and sadistic (oh I've read other stuff before)&nbsp;and I think it's because he won't sincerely talk to ANYONE.&nbsp; I mean he skates around everything that he can't make up a sugar coated story for or that he can't blame someone else for.&nbsp; It hurts beyond belief the way Corey treats us.&nbsp; But Tasha and I, we just let him keep coming back.&nbsp; He talks about his depression in his journals and about how lonely he is, but it's because he won't share his true self with us.&nbsp; He's too afraid.&nbsp; He's afraid of like, EVERYTHING and it breaks my heart.&nbsp; It breaks my heart, but it pisses me off too.&nbsp; I just want to punch him in his stupid head and make him wake up.&nbsp; It's always been something that bothers me.&nbsp; I can't have a friend who's like family but won't share it all or some of it.&nbsp; I'm not asking for everything, shit if he were at least talking to Jesus about it then I think I could leave it alone, but he isn't.&nbsp; He tries to do it all on his own and he just can't.&nbsp; I think maybe he's trying to be strong but he's too stubborn to see that he's weaker than anyone I've ever met.&nbsp; I really wish I could put into words what it is that Corey is, but I just can't.&nbsp; You have to be on the inside.&nbsp; I think Tasha and I are the only ones who've gotten that close.&nbsp; Probably because there are so few people who care that much and that want to get that deep into someone.&nbsp; It isn't about prying or invading privacy.&nbsp; It's about building a relationship on something real... on respect, and right now I know I can't respect someone who can do these things and not have a guilty conscience and on trust, which...pfft, he lost that ages ago...&nbsp; We're trying and always praying.&nbsp; Only God can help Corey change...</P>
<P>All the while, I fear my heart is deceiving me again.&nbsp; How can I possibly have feelings like this for Corey.&nbsp; After everything that's happened and the pain I've been through.&nbsp; I've never been hurt by someone as bad as I've been hurt by Corey.&nbsp; But now I'm feeling things.&nbsp; AGAIN.&nbsp; STILL.&nbsp; WHY!?!&nbsp; I don't have the strength JESUS I DON'T!&nbsp; God has to bare this burden for me.&nbsp; I can't carry this cross alone.&nbsp; Tasha and I can't carry it together.&nbsp; We're not that strong.&nbsp; We're only human.&nbsp; My heart is only human... How long will it be before it's been grinded down to nothing but the dirt we came from?&nbsp; How could I, if there were even the chance, ever have a lasting relationship with someone I don't deeply trust in everyway?&nbsp; So why the feelings?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Why can't I just get over it.&nbsp; Please tell me why.&nbsp; I've changed so much since I moved back home.&nbsp; I've gotten stronger through Christ and this time around, it took a lot longer for me to feel this heart break for Corey.&nbsp; It also seems like he's a lot more comfortable with me, which is sincerely great and I'm very happy about that... </P>
<P>The other night Corey got stoned.&nbsp; Like he was gone.&nbsp; And I didn't, because I really don't do that anymore.&nbsp; Very rarely do I but I'd never been around Corey with him stoned and I wasn't.&nbsp; So, I got to see him from a sober point of view.&nbsp; The whole time, I had this feeling that he was hitting on me but I just thought I was being paranoid.&nbsp; Well, Chris says to me ""he's hitting on you"".&nbsp; I just about wet myself.&nbsp; I'm like, no he wouldn't.&nbsp; Chris said that even if Corey wasn't meaning too, he was definitely hitting on me.&nbsp; By the way he was touching my feet to the sensual eyebrow thing, it was just obvious.&nbsp; I made the mistake of telling Corey what Chris said and I think Corey suddenly got weird with me again.&nbsp; I'm not sure, it was just a weird day and he had a migrane so he was just... weird.&nbsp; Oh my gosh, I'm just rambling.&nbsp; I don't know why I bother as I never make sense about Corey.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, I've deceided that the reason I love Chris is because he tells me what I want to hear!&nbsp; His POV is that Corey is bi (like most everyone believes, but hear me out...).&nbsp; Chris says that he's afraid of woman, relationship wise, because he doesn't understand them, but is better friends with them because he has female tendencys, while he is more comfortable with men in a relationship.&nbsp; Yeah, other than the drama.&nbsp; And he also thinks Corey will go straight (I love Chris.&nbsp; I really love him!)</P>
<P>Corey told me about a half a year ago that he did want a wife and kids someday.&nbsp; Again I say, I almost wet myself.&nbsp; I was at work at the time and interupted by a customer so I never really got to push him on the subject.&nbsp; I don't know what made Corey ever say that to ME of all people, but he did.&nbsp; And, I don't know if it was for cover up reasons or if he know's the moral issues he's got going on as a Christian, and he does want to overcome it someday?&nbsp; Does that make sense?&nbsp; God why do I try to pick his mind...</P>
<P>I can't keep my eyes open.&nbsp; Just holla at me if you have anything to say whether it be constructive criticism, loving advice, humor, encouragement, or an all out rant... give it to me.&nbsp; I'm interested in anything anyone has to say.</P>
<P>'Til then, Goodnight!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>P.S. For the record, even if Corey were to go straight, I would never expect it to be for or because of me.&nbsp; Part of me would be whole heartedly relieved to just know that Corey and I never stood a chance.&nbsp; It would just be less confusing, among other things...&nbsp; Honestly, I want him to fix him for him.&nbsp; For his soul.&nbsp; Fod God.&nbsp; Then his friends, family and&nbsp;the girl he's meant to be with.&nbsp; God Bless Corey always.</P>"

"event","<P>Okay, so I just found out that we're probably getting rid of third shift at Hardees.&nbsp; And although it could potentially suck the life out of my paychecks, I GET TO SLEEP LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING AGAIN!&nbsp; Seriously, when I first started, I thought third would be great.&nbsp; I'm a night owl and love to stay up late.&nbsp; That all changes when you have to work.&nbsp; Sleeping during the sunny hours are NOT fun.&nbsp; Man, I don't know how Vampires do it.&nbsp; ;)</P>
<P>Anyway.&nbsp; So, if we&nbsp;stop it, it will be two weeks to a month from now.&nbsp; Apparently, we aren't making enough&nbsp;revenue from&nbsp;third to keep in going, and yet it took him a year and a half to decide this.&nbsp; I know, you need time to see if things pick up.&nbsp; Well, they did until McDonalds went 24 hours (is that nationwide/international? Leave a comment if you have any info, even if it's just for the McyD's near you).&nbsp; We also have a Wendy's at our truckstop that's open all night.&nbsp; Hardees is the most expensive, so it's obvious why we don't get the business of a Dollar Menu resturant.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>So, we might be going to the dam today.&nbsp; If we do, sadly Kim can't, because she started at Hardees with us about a week and a half ago.&nbsp; Yes, now me, mom&nbsp;<EM>and</EM> Kim all work at Hardees.&nbsp; Insanity.&nbsp; I'm serious.&nbsp; This time last summer we could get at LEAST six crew members crowded into the living room at once.&nbsp; Especially when Corey worked there.&nbsp; Sometimes, more.&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Anyway...""> Anyway.&nbsp; I invited AJ from work to go with us today.&nbsp; He's my Justin Timberlake look-a-like.&nbsp; Just cuter.&nbsp; He even has a very similar personality.&nbsp; It's pretty damn cool!&nbsp; He seemed pretty psyched to go with us, because pretty much all of his friends are partiers.&nbsp; They always go out drinking and then driving.&nbsp; I don't know what the hell's wrong with people.&nbsp; Jesus save them 'cause they are all reckless heathens.&nbsp; </P>
<P>AJ was asking my mom what we do when we go out to the dam, and she was telling him that we just go to hang out, walk across it, go hiking.&nbsp; He's like, ""So, basically they just go to relax?&nbsp; Because none of my friends ever do that.""&nbsp; He apparently seemed all for it.&nbsp; Which is great, because he really needs some friends.&nbsp; I mean people who are going to truly care about him and his well being and be better influences for him.&nbsp; Not the kind of people who say they care but just want to pull him into their no-need drama.</P>
<P>He has a hard enough time at home with his dad and he had a rough childhood.&nbsp; He was talking about joining the military, but we're working on changing his mind.&nbsp; That's not what he really wants.&nbsp; AJ just feels trapped, I think, and he doesn't have money for the college he wants to attend.&nbsp; I'm going to try to convince him that there are ways around that.&nbsp; He doesn't need to waste four years of his life (IF HE LIVES THAT LONG) in the military where all they'll do is take away his individuality and twist his morals.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; AJ's already messed up.&nbsp; He needs his friends, not the Bush Crew.</P>
<P>So, I'm really looking forward to this afternoon.&nbsp; I need to get some hella strong sunblock though.&nbsp; Last Friday I had gotten a sun burn on my arm right on top of this bad rash I had and I put Benadryl on it.&nbsp; BAD mistake.&nbsp; When I woke up I was itching like mad and my arm was on fire.&nbsp; Thank God for ice cubes.&nbsp; When I got to work, I ran them up and down my arm.&nbsp; It took down the temp. and stopped the itching.&nbsp; Phew, I never loved ice so much!</P>
<P>Oh, and since I did mention Corey, I have to announce that we're all friends again.&nbsp; Frankly, I didn't want us to get involved again.&nbsp; I don't want things to end up badly and I sure as hell don't want his dramatic bullshit.&nbsp; I love him and I'll always care about him.&nbsp; He's still my friend and always will be, but I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.&nbsp; I can&nbsp;push him down (I know, I have) but I surely can't throw him.&nbsp; So I guess that leaves zero trust.&nbsp; That hurts.&nbsp; Tasha is really happy about it and that's the only reason I'm going along with this.&nbsp; I want her to be happy but I'm going to very cautious.&nbsp; He just better not hurt her the way he did before (his ""fault"" or not).&nbsp; I don't care what he does to me... he just better not do anything to Tash or anyone else I love.&nbsp; </P>
<P>That being said, and I'll tell him all this, I will forgive, but I will <U>not</U> forget.&nbsp; I know that I'm supposed to forgive, but I also know that trust is something earned and can easily be take back.&nbsp; It is NOT a right, it is a privilege.&nbsp; And even though Tasha welcomes him back with more enthusiasm that I, I know she doesn't trust him either... so he better just know.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On a brighter note, TomKat (Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes) are <EM>finally</EM> engaged after TWO months.&nbsp; I mean WOW I NEVER thought they were going to finally commit... *rolls eyes*&nbsp; C'mon.&nbsp; Well, at least Ben Affleck and Jen Garner can have a break from prying eyes.&nbsp; They are due for a vacay.</P>"

"event","<P>I had a revelation yesterday morning.

<lj-cut text=""My droaning"">This is the first time since high school that I've had a deep, <EM>deep</EM> crush on someone that I know.&nbsp; Corey was different in that, I was in love with him... it was an obsession I won't soon&nbsp;forget but SO different than those high school crushes.&nbsp; Then Craig differed in that I confused myself after the whole Corey thing.&nbsp; I have a very hard time discerning friendship love from in love.&nbsp; This has been a big problem for me and since Corey (Craig excluded), I've really grown spiritually and God's helped me control my physical actions in relation to my emotions and how I think I feel for a guy.&nbsp; Meaning I don't follow&nbsp;them around, pestering and making it glaringly obvious&nbsp;that I dig them.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Right after the Corey sitch, Craig came home from college.&nbsp; This being last summer.&nbsp; We spent most of the summer together, talking, bonding and that's when I started to think that, that closeness was something&nbsp;like those special feelings two people get for one another.&nbsp; They were closely related but much different.&nbsp; It was really just that Craig and I were both going through something that we could both relate too, and in that time our friendship blossomed into something that I never thought we'd have when we were in high school.&nbsp; I'm so happy that our relationship has become what it has.&nbsp; I'm now confidant that I'm over the misconception of our relationship so that we can keep working on it and continue it's growth.&nbsp; It's what I've come to learn is something that God want's more than anything.&nbsp; Strong, deep, meaningful relationships between His people.&nbsp; Romance is not needed and shouldn't even enter the&nbsp;equation.&nbsp; It's definitely something I'm proud of because I feel like the relationship I have with Craig and what I'm working on with Tasha is the closest thing to God that I have.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Another revelation.&nbsp; Hallelujah!&nbsp; God, I thank you for my friends.</P>
<P>Craig and Tasha are the ones I'm closest too, but I love and treasure each and every one that I have.&nbsp; So if you're on my friendlist, you are amazing to me.</P>
<P>I'm getting off topic.&nbsp; I meant to talk about the&nbsp;guy at work that I'm pining, or not, over.&nbsp; Well, like I said.&nbsp; I haven't had this type of crush since high school.&nbsp; The kind where you feel like your stomaches floating away and you find yourself deep in daydreams and you suddenly smack yourself and think, ""I'm not supposed to think that way about <EM>him</EM>!""</P>
<P>Yeah.&nbsp; It's like that.</P>
<P>Jeremiah won't get out of my head.&nbsp; I've known him over two years, since my mom started working at Hardees.&nbsp; I remember&nbsp;thinking he seemed like such a dweeb.&nbsp; He actually looks kind of dorky. &nbsp;I think it's the glasses.&nbsp; Well, with his ""upbringing"" of sorts, he's an alchy and a stoner.&nbsp; If you're shocked (because I actually like someone like that), don't be.&nbsp; Most of the people I know around here are.&nbsp; That's just the way this part of Wisconsin is.&nbsp; That above all was a turn-off.&nbsp; He's also not Christian and it pains me to know that&nbsp;about a friend, let alone someone I&nbsp;care about on crush (or deeper) level.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There was a period when I was crushing on him.&nbsp; See, when you start to get to know Miah you can't help but like him.&nbsp; He's just a cool guy and oddly he's like SUPER respectful.&nbsp; Dammit.&nbsp; This would have been easier for me, had he been an asswhole, right?!?&nbsp; And then there's his voice.&nbsp; Dude, I mean serious, Miah has the coolest American accent I've ever heard.&nbsp; It's like the slightest touch southern with a small&nbsp;twist of ghetto.&nbsp; Now, I'm not partial to either, but on him, he sounds so... cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean&nbsp;it's like, light airy versions of southern and ghetto.&nbsp; It's hard to explain, you just have to trust me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Right.&nbsp; So then shortly after I had decided to crush on Miah, Rebbecca starts working at Hardees.&nbsp; I've never liked this girl.&nbsp; She's in a worse mood than I am.&nbsp; All the time.&nbsp; (I'm always in a bad mood when I get to work...)&nbsp; So,&nbsp;suddenly Miah and Becca start going together.&nbsp; I wasn't heartbroken, because although I sort of crushed on Jeremiah it wasn't anything.... passionate?&nbsp; It was mostly superficial.&nbsp; Although, at the same time I wasn't too enthusiastic about the new coupling.&nbsp; I soon got over it though, and with that went my crush.&nbsp; I even sort of forgotten that I had a crush on Miah, and all was well with the world.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Jeremiah and Becca fight like mad, and I believe, unbiasedly, that it's mostly because of Becca.&nbsp; She's just so insane.&nbsp; Jealous like nothing I've ever seen.&nbsp; He can't talk to any girls... no, anyone... without her being the center of attention or she'll just go off (although my mom and I have always seemed to be the exception.&nbsp; I think mom made is scarily clear to her long ago that if she ever pulled that crap on either of us she was going down.).&nbsp; Miah works backline (so he cooks) while Becca worked frontline (cashier) but she was in the back more than the food.&nbsp; Every chance she had (and she made sure she had the chance) she was back there in his biz.&nbsp; This has always bugged me hardcore and I wondered why he put up with it.&nbsp; I never said anything to either of them though, as I wasn't really involved and didn't have to work with it.&nbsp; Becca quit Hardees last week for a job somewhere else, and I have to say I'm surprised that the managers and half the crew didn't throw a party.&nbsp; Probably out of respect for Miah.&nbsp; *smirk*&nbsp; </P>
<P>Nikki, who was the main third shift manager before she went back to school, has been working with Miah more now on second shift.&nbsp; Nikki is my major inspiration for maturing spiritually and this woman is ALWAYS in the Spirit.&nbsp; Two Sundays ago she worked with Miah and she popped in this Christian stand-up comedy that she had on CD.&nbsp; Well, Miah loved it.&nbsp; The next night he was telling me about it.&nbsp; That's when it started happening.&nbsp; My crush suddenly came back.&nbsp; *smacks self*&nbsp; Son. Of. A.&nbsp;Bitch.&nbsp; Could someone PLEASE tell me what's wrong with me.&nbsp; What is God trying to teach me?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway.&nbsp; That night and the next, we had actual conversations.&nbsp; Miah and I have always chit chatted in passing but never actually held our own conversations and it was like this light flickered on inside.&nbsp; I want Jeremiah to be saved.&nbsp; Nikki keeps going on about how he's going to be saved and sanctified and I believe she's going to speak that thing into existence.&nbsp; Since last week I've been praying hardcore for Miah because I have this sudden, meaningful, I don't know... feeling or knowledge that's in my heart.&nbsp; I fully believe that Miah is going to be saved and I want it SO much for him.&nbsp; I suddenly see more to Miah than I've ever seen before.&nbsp; He's a really special guy and I'm hoping that I can witness this man's testimony.&nbsp; He's even started wearing his cross to work.&nbsp; I have no idea why.&nbsp; I don't know if it's just for Nikki's sake or if he really want's to be saved.&nbsp; I too, have started encouraging wherever I see the opportunity.&nbsp; He keeps denying that he'll be saved... but it's only a matter of time.&nbsp; I just pray that in that time God helps me discern my feelings, so I know what it is I'm <EM>really</EM> feeling for Miah.&nbsp; It could just be great Christian love, or it could be something deeper.&nbsp; But I know that's God's call.&nbsp; If anything is meant to happen between Miah and I, either God or Miah will instigate that.&nbsp; Not I.&nbsp; And that being, that I'm following the very old fashioned Proverb (18:22), that a man who find's a wife has found a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I think that, that is part of the reason I've never been fortunate in the boyfriend area.&nbsp; That, and I know I probably would have lost my virginity by now had I had a boyfriend.&nbsp; I'm proud to have my virginity, and proud to know I've been blessed enough to not&nbsp;have that temptation easily bestowed upon me.&nbsp; It took me a long time to figure that out.&nbsp; God's really been there to back me up in that department.&nbsp; I'm certainly glad I know nothing's wrong with me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>*snort*&nbsp; That reminds me of the other day at work.&nbsp; I have Friday and Saturday nights off, and since Becca quit, she was still on the schedule for Saturday, 2-10.&nbsp; My mom was saying that they were going to be really short and didn't know what they would do for that shift, so I for some reason volunteered to work.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I've never given up my weekend to put in extra hours.&nbsp; I surprised myself!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Yeah, so I did.&nbsp; Miah worked at 2 (yay!) and Mark worked at 4.&nbsp; Mark is actually someone Tasha, Chris, Kim and I hang out with outside of work, so we were socializing when it slowed down and somehow we got on the topic of my virginity.&nbsp; Mark was, impressed, and so I asked him if he was really so surprised.&nbsp; Then Mark, being Mark, starts talking about statistics and I said ""I'm not a statistic!""&nbsp; and he's like ""Good for you!"".&nbsp; So, that's when Miah waltzes up and I say to Mark, ""For a long time I thought there was something wrong with me"" and Miah's like, ""There <EM>is </EM>something wrong with you.""&nbsp; I couldn't help but laugh.&nbsp; I guess I'd never realized he'd paid enough attention to know that I'm zany.&nbsp; Trust me, when I'm in a good mood at work, I'm like so crazy.&nbsp; Craziness.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, this has gone on long enough.&nbsp; I didn't think it would get this long.&nbsp; And, not that I normally watch it, the Backstreet Boys are supposed to be performing on the View today, so I have to go pay attention to that.</P>
<P>God Bless!</P>"

"event","So, Zack and Sue came through the Drive-thru last night and I mentioned getting into bartending.&nbsp; They thought it was a good idea until I mentioned the Academy.&nbsp; Zack said he'd gone there awhile back and he was certified and everything but they have yet to find him a job.&nbsp; Apparently, you have to live in Madison if you want a job... ?&nbsp; Okay, I was under the impression they would get you a job anywhere.&nbsp; Although if you're certified I'm sure it would be easy to find your-<EM>self</EM> a job?&nbsp; Maybe?&nbsp; He also said that he paid $250 and they charge everyone different fees (usually more).&nbsp; I dunno, I didn't have time for details so I'll have to call them later I think, to find out for sure.&nbsp; If anything, I can check out Blackhawk Community College because I think they have a Responsible Beverage course there and if I can get certified there, it'd probably be WAY cheaper, not to mention the campus is in Janesville.&nbsp; I just don't know if I'd be certified only for this county or what.&nbsp; No idea how it works... but I guess I'll keep workin' on it!"

<P>I figure with working third shift, I could take the weekend classes and I'd be through in two weeks.&nbsp; And dude, being a bartender I could live practically anywhere I wanted and live a pretty sweet lifestyle.&nbsp; At least compared to what I'm living now.&nbsp; The only problem is, I don't know if I'd have a way there and back both weekends.&nbsp; That's four trips a week, eight trips total.&nbsp; I'd totally pay for gas.&nbsp; Hm.&nbsp; God, I pray that I can get that stupid liscence soon.&nbsp; And, God Willing before July 29th when my permit expires.&nbsp; Shit, that's Chris' birthday, too.&nbsp; Loser.&nbsp; *lovesyouchris*&nbsp; I'm just so sick of not being my own ride.&nbsp; Thank God I did get that bike, but He knows I'm not pedaling my fat-ass from Janesville to Madison!&nbsp; That would be like three hours.&nbsp; Fuck that.</P>

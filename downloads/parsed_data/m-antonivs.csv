"event","Torches have been set up, of course, and food brought--far more food than they can eat, and more wine too, more than even Antony can drink.  And why not?  Is it not the celebration of their birthdays, of the anniversaries of the moment when the gods saw fit to send them, the living Isis and the living Osiris, down among mortals?

Well, her birthday was a little while back, and the celebration has continued to now, the night of his.  So here they are, down by the lake, everything ready for a party.

All are welcome."

"event","Antony's room is nowhere near as lavish as the palace, nor even his stolen palace in Rome, but it's sumptuous enough, and has at least some of the modern conveniences--comfortable velvet couches in the living room, mahogany and marble covered surfaces in the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom.  The bed is huge, canopied and covered in red and gold bedding; the bathroom is spotless, featuring a bathtub large enough for three or four if they're on very good terms with each other.

He smiles lazily as he holds the door open for her.  ""Your palace away from home, my dove."""

"event","Antony had been away long enough.

He cannot in good conscience stay away from his men any longer, no matter how pleasant it may be in the bar, no matter that time does not pass back home while he is there, no matter how much he enjoys the peace there--a rare thing, after what seems like an eternity of war in the Roman world.  No, his men are starving, freezing, dying, and he will not repay their loyalty with self-indulgence.

If they starve, he starves with them.  If he has food, he shares it with them.

So in the small hours of the morning, when the bar is at its least crowded, he gathers up as much food as he can carry--bread mostly, and a few rabbits hunted from outside--and steps back through the door.

It is still cold on the other side, even though it is spring.  He wonders why he had ever let Atia talk him into wanting Gaul.  Macedonia would have been much more pleasant, more civilized, more peaceful, warmer.  He could have been happy there... but she hadn't wanted to go, and he never could say no to her.

Women would be the death of him.  He isn't entirely sure they haven't already been.

Just as women had been the death of Caesar.

<i>But while it lasts...</i>

He wants nothing more than to see Atia again.  Well, not just to see her; a long night in a warm bed with her, followed by a lazy soak in the bath while eating a big breakfast.  He can almost taste her.  The more he thinks about her, the more real and present she seems, warm and soft and commanding.

If he sees her again, he will be resolute, and tell her they should have settled for Macedonia.  If he sees her again and is not a prisoner--

In camp again at last, he smiles at the tired remains of his army, the men still loyal to him, who still believe in him; and he carries the feast into the midst of them before setting it down, almost reverently.  Morale must be nurtured, and he is sure this will cheer the men.

""The goddess of peace will not let us starve,"" he says.  ""I saw her out there, in the hills beyond the camp, and she gave me this for us to share.  I want you think of her, I want you to thank her--as I do--and I want you to remember that that's why we are fighting.  So that when this is all over, we can go home to our families again and live in peace.""

If they were to stop fighting now, they'd most likely be captured and executed, or at least Antony himself would be.  He has long since crossed the line of being too dangerous for his enemies to let live.  But he has faith now, strange enough to think such a thing--faith that he will make it through somehow, that his men's loyalty will be rewarded, that he will see Atia again.

<i>But he has to believe it, or his men will see his lack of conviction.</i>

""When we get home again,"" he continues, watching the men gather their long-underused cooking gear to prepare the rabbits, ""we must all offer sacrifices, in gratitude for her favor.  She likes flowers, or for birds to be released.  She doesn't like animals being killed for her.""

The men are in much better spirits once they have settled in to eat, and Antony takes a portion of bread and stew back to his tent for Lysander, his personal slave on this campaign.

(The youth had been promoted when Antony's previous personal slave had died of his injuries in the days immediately following Mutina.  But Antony likes his new slave, and has found him to be decent company, considering he was a slave promoted from the baggage train and not one particularly trained as a personal attendant.)

The young man takes the food he is given, grateful.  Antony sits at the desk and watches him eat, thinking about his former slave, and how quickly what seems like a minor injury can turn fatal.  Life is fragile, but it keeps fighting for itself, it keeps trying.  <i>They</i> keep trying.  If the gods had seen fit to give them life, why should they simply give up thier lives in the face of adversity?  No, they will fight.  He will not surrender to Octavian.

He is spared from trying to reconcile his life's work with the idea that life is a gift from the gods when Lysander, having finished his stew, finally speaks.

""They say it's not the first time you've had the favor of a goddess,"" he says.

""No,"" Antony agrees with a smile.

""I always thought only the priests could,"" the young man says, and takes a bite of bread.  ""What were they like?  Did you know all the time that they were goddesses, or were they in the shape of mortal women?""

""You can't help but know, after you've been around them for a little while,"" says Antony, pouring himself a cup of water.  ""The goddess of peace, she makes you feel peaceful.  Safe.  Like there's nothing else in the world but the two of you--like the best woman you've ever had, but more so.""

""Do you think that--"" the slave begins, but is interrupted by the arrival of one of the camp guards.

""General Antony, sir,"" he says, saluting.  ""There are riders approaching camp.""

""Riders?"" asks Antony, standing.  ""Who?""

And when the man tells him, Antony <i>knows</i> he has the favor of the gods."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Early morning, house of the Antonii"">
The sky is already getting light by the time Antony returns home.  He passes the shrine to his ancestors and household gods, and pauses for a moment to give silent thanks that he has returned safely.

It had gone surprisingly well.  The humiliations of the evening--the glares, the insults, the outright threats--had all been washed away by the blood of the man, by the look of terror on his face as he realized no one would come to help him, by the satisfying splash of a body landing in the sewer below.

(He gives silent thanks, also, to the memory of those long-gone ancestors of other men, who had built the sewers.)

He takes his bloodstained tunic off and throws it onto the smoldering kitchen hearthfire; better to dispose of it than worry about the slaves getting curious.  Wrapping himself in his cloak (surprisingly clean after everything that had happened), he hurries toward his bedroom, luckily managing to avoid any of the slaves.

(He had been seen by the one outside the door, but his cloak had hidden the blood.)

He throws his cloak over a chair, rinses his hands off in the basin and splashes some water on his face, and feels much better.  He had thought he would feel very different, after killing a man--that his life would forever be divided into the time before, and the time after--but he feels just the same, except a bit tired.

<i>He is his family's son.</i>

Fadia is there, in bed.  He can see her in the dim light, so small a shape under the covers even pregnant as she is.  So he joins her, climbing in behind her and draping an arm around her waist.  He likes to imagine the child she carries, picturing it as a son who looks rather like Antony's father must have when he was a baby.  He feels the baby kick, and so intent is he on feeling for it again that he doesn't notice Fadia stirring.

""Marcus, you're home,"" she says sleepily.

""The party was a bore, but... business, you know,"" he answers, closing his eyes.

""I'm glad you're home, though.  I sleep better when you're here.""  She snuggles back against him, taking his hand in hers.

""So do I,"" he says, and it's at least partially true.  He sleeps better with company than alone, and Fadia doesn't move much in her sleep.

She brings his hand up to kiss it.  (He does not see her staring at the blood he hadn't completely washed off, especially under his nails.)

""Marcus,"" she says softly, eventually, ""what is to become of us?""

""The same thing that becomes of everyone, I suppose,"" he says, not understanding where the sudden question had come from.  ""We've got a family, we'll have more children, and I'll have a career--maybe I'll go into politics, maybe I'll join the legions.  And we'll live.""

""Will you--you should invite Curio over more often, instead of always going over to visit him.  I want to be a proper hostess to your friends.  If you're going to be a politician, or even a great soldier, we'll need to host parties, won't we?""

""Curio's a busy man.  He's invited to so many other parties; he probably wouldn't have time to come to ours.""

""If he's as good a friend as you say, he would come,"" she says quietly.  ""Unless I'm the problem...""

Curio had nothing but contempt for Fadia, thought of her as mousy and common.  Antony may not love his wife, but he doesn't want her humiliated either.  It was best to keep them apart.

""How about this,"" he says.  ""After the baby comes, we will go spend time by the sea--us, the children, maybe some of your friends and my family.  We'll spend the summer out there, get away from the city for a while.""

""I'd like that,"" she says, squeezing his hand.  ""And maybe next year--next year, could we go to Athens?""

""Anywhere you like,"" he says, and at least at that moment, just before drifting off to sleep, he means it.

Afterward, as they lie sprawled on the bed together, Antony cleans himself off while Curio calls for a slave to bring more wine.  The wine is brought, Curio takes the first sip, and then he passes the cup to Antony.

It seems they share almost everything, these days.

""Look at you,"" purrs Curio, in that voice of his--the most finely-tuned weapon Antony has ever encountered-- ""all grown-up and brooding.  You're going to give yourself wrinkles if you're not careful.  And then where will you be?  Worry just enough to give yourself a few grey hairs, but not too many.  You'll look distinguished; it'll do wonders for your career.""

Antony takes another sip of wine.  He hasn't <i>got</i> a career, and they both know it.

""What <i>is</i> it, then?"" Curio asks, taking the cup back from him and settling in with his head on Antony's chest.  ""What could <i>possibly</i> be bothering you so?  What could spoil a night like this?""

""My wife is unhappy,"" says Antony with a faint shrug.

""And?""  Curio looks sideways up at him.

""And she's unhappy.  That's all there is.""  He reaches for the cup, but Curio moves it away, taking another drink himself.

""Her happiness is not your concern,"" Curio says after a moment.  ""Can you really be responsible for the happiness of anyone else?  Can anyone?  Worry about your own; let her find hers.""

""I'm the reason she's unhappy.  She wants me to be home more often, wants us to spend more time together.""  He manages to take hold of the cup, this time.

""She wants to make a woman of you,"" says Curio, contempt creeping into his voice, ""or a slave.  And I know you, Antony; you are neither.  You are a bright flame--should you burn yourself out uselessly on the hearth, or should you light up the city?  In my mind, there is no question at all.""

""It's not like that,"" says Antony, and drains the cup.  ""She loves me, and she's been very good to me.  She's a good wife.  It wouldn't be so bad to--""

""Those are her words, not yours,"" interrupts Curio.  ""She wants you to think like that.  If you start thinking that way, she's got you under her control.  That's what she really wants, you know--same with your mother.  They want to control you, and don't care if you're happy.  That's how women <i>are.</i>""

""You've never had a wife,"" Antony points out.

""No--that's how I can tell you this.  I've never been... bewitched, the way you have.  I see it from the outside, and I can tell you, your Fadia wants you for her own selfish purposes.  I've got years more experience with women than you do; I know these things.  They're like children.  You've <i>got</i> to say no, and you've got to mean it.  You can't let them have their way.""

...it makes sense, in a way.  But then, everything Curio says makes sense at the time.

""Antony,"" Curio says, taking the empty cup from him and handing it off to his slave, ""have I ever led you astray?  Have I ever lied to you?  Other people want to control you, but I've got your interests, your happiness, at heart.  I'd never hurt you like they do, but you've got to trust me.""

Antony remembers the first time he had gone to Curio's bed.  Curio had plied him with wine and flattery, called him his 'young Dionysus,' and offered him enough money to pay off a large percentage of his debts.  He had been sixteen at the time, and one night with a wealthy enough man <i>could</i> make a serious dent in what he owed his creditors; but those days are long gone now, and Curio doesn't give him money anymore.  He pays for the wine and women while Antony gambles and somehow, neither of them ever seems to win.  But Curio is far better than Antony at making more money--he can charm anyone into anything--so his debts are not quite so extravagant.

""I trust you,"" Antony says.

""Good boy,"" says Curio, and kisses him.  His stubble is rough against Antony's cheek, and he tastes of wine.  ""Get dressed.  We are going to Pavo's for a bit of entertainment tonight.""

""Pavo's?"" he asks, stiffening.  ""I can't go there.  I still owe him money.  A great deal of money.""

""You owe <i>everyone</i> money, Antony,"" Curio says with a dismissive chuckle, sitting up.  ""If you never went anywhere for fear of running into someone you owe money to, you'd never leave your house.  And even then, you'd probably have to stay in your room, and have a slave slip your meals in under the door.  We're going.""

""He'll kill me for sure.  He threatened me, last time I saw him, said if he saw me again and I didn't have the money with me he'd cut my balls off and feed them to my wife.  I had to borrow money from my father-in-law, and even then--""

""Why would you do a thing like that?"" he asks sharply, the music gone from his voice.  ""Fadius bought you once for his daughter, and now he has bought you for himself.  That's what they want, to own you--to have power over you, a proper Roman citizen from a good family, to make up for their having been slaves.  And you've <i>let</i> them.  I expected better of you.""

""You were out of town--what else could I have done?  I needed the money, and it seemed to me he'd be the least likely to demand repayment in blood.  There was no other choice.""

""There's always a choice, Antony.  You've just been too afraid to take it.""

Antony remembers the first time he had seen Curio speak, defending some wife-killer at a public trial.  He had held the crowd in his hand--they strained to catch each word when he lowered his voice, and trembled when he raised it.  In that moment, Antony had wanted nothing more than to <i>be</i> Curio, but lacking any skill at oratory, he settled for basking in the light of him.  He had taken up gambling in earnest solely for the chance to get close to him; and now that he is, he cannot imagine being anywhere else.

""Will you live in fear?"" Curio continues, voice barely more than a whisper.  ""Will you let Pavo and all of them--your mother, your wife, your father-in-law--will you let them tell you how to live?  Or will you be the man I <i>know</i> you are?""

""What will you have me do?"" Antony whispers, though he suspects he already knows.

""We will go to Pavo's tonight,"" Curio says with a smile.  ""You will stay close to me.  He won't touch you if you're with me.  We will drink, we will enjoy ourselves.  And at the end of the evening, after most of the others have gone home, well... it will be self-defense.  I will be your witness, if need be, if you are caught.  But you won't be caught.  And then both our debts will be erased, no?""

""I suppose,"" says Antony after a moment, quietly, unconvinced but not wanting to seem afraid.  He has killed before, accidentally, in fights that got out of hand; but he has never deliberately set out to kill, and it's a line he hadn't expected to cross, not this soon.

""My young Hercules,"" says Curio, purring again, ""my young lion of a man.  So bold, so strong--look at you.  Unstoppable, when you put your mind to something.""

He waves the slave over to bring yet more wine, and shifts position to pin Antony to the bed.  ""You need a bit more courage in you before we go, my pet,"" he murmurs in Antony's ear, ""but I doubt he'll mind if we are delayed.""

"event","<lj-cut text=""Evening, in the house of the Antonii."">
It is early evening when Antony arrives home, and he is in a good mood.  Such a good mood, in fact, that he is singing to himself--the words of some Greek poet or other, in praise of a lovely shepherdess; he has forgotten many of the words, but it's a cheerful little tune, and so he sings.

He can hear the sounds of conversation and dishes from the dining room and, deciding that he wouldn't mind a bite to eat, and anyway he can surprise his wife with the jewelry he had taken for her from the buried treasure, he heads that way.

He is passing through the courtyard, still singing, when he hears small footsteps hurrying his way: his elder daughter Antonia, nearly four, running toward him with arms outstretched.

""Papa,"" she says with a smile, as he scoops her up into his arms, ""there are butterflies living in the garden now.""

""Are there?"" he asks, slinging her over his shoulder as he carries her into the dining room.  ""We'll have to--""

""Marcus,"" says his mother Julia, from a seat at the table, in the icily proper tone he remembers all too well from childhood scoldings, eyeing his torn clothing, ""how good of you to come home.""

He hadn't been expecting company.  He scans the room in the hopes that someone can serve as a distraction.  The only ones present are his wife Fadia, who is staring at him with an unreadable expression; and his youngest brother Lucius, who is watching him with drunken amusement.  There are slaves too, of course, but there was never a slave born who would dare to cross Julia Antonia, so no help there either.

""Mother,"" he says, working up a casual smile as he leans in to give her a kiss on the cheek, ""it's so good to see you again.  Has Antonia shown you the butterflies?""

""You've been gone for five days,"" she says, tone not thawing in the slightest.

""Well, I had business--""

""Business, in Rome, that kept you from coming home even at night?""  She picks up her cup of wine.  ""Gambling, whores, or both?""

He sets his daughter back down in her chair, stalling for a bit of time while he tries to think of an answer.  He's never been able to lie to his mother, and he hasn't had much luck charming her into distraction either.  Nothing gets by her.

""Before you answer,"" she continues, ""I should tell you that Philon saw you.  And your woman, sneaking out of here two days ago, and then coming back for a horse, and leaving again.  You didn't lose the horse, I hope?  Gamble it away, or give it to that woman?""

""I brought it back,"" he says, and turns his attention to Fadia, hoping that she can help him.  ""And I brought you something too, my dove.""

Lucius snorts, and slurs something about slaves and horses.

Fadia gives Lucius a sharp look (that goes unnoticed) and then a softer one to her husband, hope and fear plain in her eyes.  ""You didn't have to,"" she says quietly.

""But I wanted to.""  He takes the bracelet he'd chosen for her from the bag containing his share of the haul (and her eyes widen as she peeks into the bag, but she says nothing), and fastens it around one of her wrists.  ""Now you look even more like a goddess...""

""...it isn't stolen, is it?"" she whispers to him, probably a little more loudly than she had intended, eliciting a snicker from Lucius and a horrified stare from Julia.

""Of course not,"" he says, squeezing her hand.  ""Nor gambled either--it's all yours, my pet.""

She looks unconvinced, but doesn't argue.

Julia sets her cup down, and rises to her feet.  ""Fadia, you must come to dinner at our house tomorrow evening.  Bring the girls with you--my husband will be back from his journey by then, and you know how he loves when they visit.  They listen to his stories.  Lucius, come.""

With a frown, and a less-than-steady movement, Antony's brother also stands, and they make their way toward the door, bidding their goodbyes.  Fadia follows them, as does her daughter; but Antony does not, choosing instead to pick through the remains of the meal.  He knows his mother's moods, and trying to get a proper goodbye from her right now would only cause a scene.

Later that evening, after Antonia is handed off to the same nurse who has been tending her younger sister, Antony and Fadia retire to their room, where she combs out her thick red hair and he counts out his spoils from the treasure hoard.  Neither of them says anything, and the silence grows more awkward, and he is relieved when she finally puts the lights out and climbs into bed.

He isn't particularly in the mood, and she's already pregnant anyway, so there isn't much point to it, but it seems to be the sort of night where he <i>ought</i> to make love to her, and so he does.  It isn't passionate at all, and he can't imagine she doesn't notice.  He doesn't feel anything for her, and he doesn't know why--she is young, plump and red-haired, exactly the way he prefers his women, and she's not unattractive.  When they were first married, he couldn't keep his hands off her, but now...

He rolls over onto his side, closing his eyes.  Maybe if he can fall asleep quickly... but no, she has snuggled up behind him, leaning her head against the back of his neck.

""Marcus,"" she murmurs, ""the bracelet is lovely.  Thank you.""

""Mmmm,"" he says.

She is silent for a moment, then slips an arm around his waist.  ""This one will be a boy, I'm sure of it.""

""A son,"" he says, trying to sound half-asleep.  ""I'd like that.""

Another awkward moment of silence.  When she speaks again, it is with an even smaller voice, a tone he has never heard her use before.

""I know you have other women,"" she says, ""and I know they're not all slaves or whores.  I'd rather you didn't, but I can't change you.  But please... please don't bring them here.  Not to our home.  Not where our children are.""

""It wasn't like that,"" he protests, looking back over his shoulder at her.  ""That woman, she talks to spirits.  She talked to an Etruscan one, and he told us where his treasure was buried.  That's why we took the horse; it was a few miles outside the walls.""

""Of course,"" she says, sounding like she is trying to convince herself.

""It's true,"" he says, turning over to face her.  ""Where else would I have gotten coins like those?  Hundreds of years old, but in better condition than most of the coins people spend in the forum.  Buried treasure.""

She sighs softly, and rests a hand on his cheek.  ""I'm sure you'd rather have a patrician wife than me, the daughter of a freedman,"" she whispers, ""but I've been a good wife to you.  And I <i>love</i> you.""

""I know,"" he says.  And after he says it, he realizes that he should've said ""I love you too,"" that it would have been the appropriate thing to say even if he didn't mean it, which he wouldn't have; the unsaid words lie painfully between them, obvious to both of them.  But with each passing heartbeat the moment to say them is further and further away, and there is nothing he can do now but let it go.

And so he does.

"event","Antony was disappointed, of course, so he made up for it by being harsher than usual with his men.

On his return from the bar, he had set himself up for a wonderful evening--Atia was hosting another of her parties, and he would go, enjoy some drinking and feasting while helping Caesar to bribe certain officials whose favor they would need; and then, at the end of the evening when the guests had gone home, he and Atia would possibly take a bath, but inevitably screw like animals, and then he would sleep well into the next morning.  In other words, aside from Caesar and the bribery, Antony's usual nights in Rome.  And he <i>liked</i> them that way.

But that magnificent oaf Pullo had spoiled all of that, showing up with Pompey's bastard son and word of the stolen treasury gold.  And so Caesar had sent him, with Pullo, to dig up and retrieve the gold.  And he had reprimanded Antony--mildly, but any reprimand from Caesar at all was very much out of the ordinary for him, so it had stung.

And he knew he'd best behave himself tonight, and that meant staying in camp, and not going back to join Atia after the party.

There was so much gold that moving it back to camp was slow and difficult work, and they had to get it all done before sunrise, and it was cold and damp and just plain unpleasant out there, none of which helped Antony's mood at all.  Nor the fact that, of all that gold, he himself would get nothing--they were spending so much to bribe priests and augurs, but no spoils for themselves.  Of course, of course, it looked better to the people if they didn't seem to have taken Rome for personal gain; but Jupiter's <i>cock,</i> he had debts to pay, and women and wine did not buy themselves.

He thought, on the road back to camp, about calling on an actress he knew, who had not fled the city.  He liked actresses--the ones he knew could be had for the price of sharing a decent meal and some wine, and he could talk to them, which was more than he could say for most of the whores he'd known, many of whom (increasingly so, lately) barely spoke any Latin or Greek at all.  Sometimes a man wants a little conversation before going in, someone he can talk to over wine and oysters first.

But by the time he has gotten to the camp, and seen to it that the gold was safely put away, he is simply too tired--between the bar and the party and then moving the gold, he has been up for almost two days straight--and all he can do is crawl into bed in his tent and give orders that, except for Caesar, no one should disturb him unless there is an emergency.

Not four hours later, Caesar sends for him.

And Antony gives his report on the gold, as though Caesar didn't already know everything he had to say about it; and Caesar nods, and tells him he had done well.  Antony is pleased, and the knowledge that he is once more in Caesar's favor encourages him.

""There is something else,"" he says, after they have finished discussing the rest of their business and Caesar has asked whether there is anything more to report.  ""I have had... a vision.  And I made a promise, and with your permission, I'd like to keep it.""

Antony is far better at intimidation than he is at lying to someone who knows him so well.  Caesar, for his part, shows only a calculatedly casual mild amusement.

""A vision?"" he asks, with a smile.  ""What sort of vision?""

""A goddess,"" says Antony.  ""Medusa, in all her glory.  And she gave me her favor, and we cannot fail here, but... in return, I promised her the worship of one of our legions.""

A moment of silence passes between them, Caesar watching him in faint suspicion.  ""What sort of worship?"" he asks eventually.

""Fight in her name,"" Antony shrugs.  ""Offer up some of our captives to her now and then, if we've got them to spare.  Speak of her with reverence, and not as just the killable one of her sisters.  She's a fascinating woman, and it's much better to have her on our side than against us.""

Caesar studies him, unreadable as ever.  ""Antony,"" he says after another long pause, ""are you <i>certain</i> it was a vision, and not bad wine and some foreign whore?""

""I swear to you on Jupiter's stone that I saw her, the actual Medusa, closer to me than you are right now, ghostlike, covered in blood from her attack.  And she hasn't <i>got</i> a cult in Rome, and the idea of one pleases her.""

It's all true, and so Antony can be utterly sincere about it, which is probably the only thing that allows Caesar to respond as he does.

""Well,"" says Caesar, after a moment of thought, ""if one of my generals has spoken to a goddess, and she has asked for our worship, I will not stand in the way.  But keep it informal, for now.  We still need the priests on our side.""

Antony nods, pleased.  ""Thank you,"" he says, rising and starting for the door.

""Oh, and Antony?""

He stops, turning back.

""Keep it subtle,"" Caesar says.  <i>""We</i> are the ones favored by the gods.  Our army as a whole, not individuals.""

""Of course,"" says Antony, understanding, and he goes off to seek his own second-in-command, a man named Vatinius, to set his plan in motion.  It seems to him that it will work best if it starts as a rumor campaign, whispers here and there that he has had a vision, and after a week or so of letting the rumors spread, he will finally make an announcement to confirm it.

And after his meeting with Vatinius, he goes back to his tent for some well-earned rest.  He'll go see Atia tonight, and while it won't be a party, he is perfectly agreeable to not having an audience."

"event","Travel had been much swifter, much smoother and much cleaner once they reached the Via Flaminia; and from there--as they say, all roads lead to Rome.  It's surprising how much the love of the people can do, especially combined with a few well-placed bribes; their progress toward the city was unhindered, and now, here within sight of its walls, there was still no sign of any opposition.

Caesar had been characteristically silent about this during the journey, but there were rumors going around among the men that it was a sign, that the gods <i>wanted</i> them to do this.  (Antony suspected that the rumors were being encouraged, but he pretended not to notice--they were only as good as the morale of their men, and he knew it.)

As they drew nearer to the city, a rider approached, a legionary in full gear.  One of the scouting party they'd sent out, Antony observed; a man named--Cornelius, he remembered after a moment.  Distinguished veteran of Alesia, a good man, but unable to handle strong drink.  Cornelius approached; Caesar gave the order for the men to halt, and he and Antony rode out to meet the scout.

""Good Cornelius,"" Caesar said when they were at a distance suited for conversation.  ""What news do you have for us?""

The scout saluted.  ""Sir,"" he said, ""the Pompeyans and most of the Senate are gone, fled to the south--I sent a few of the men to follow them.  There's nobody left in the city but the poor, and your supporters.""

Caesar smiled, and he turned his horse and rode back alongside the legion, to make the announcement.  Antony followed him, trying to read the unreadable.

""Our enemies,"" Caesar was saying, ""have abandoned Rome.  They have taken their gold, and their families, and they have fled the city, leaving the people--<i>our</i> people--alone and defenseless.  It is up to us to protect them, to show them that there are still those who care about and fight for the common people, for the ideals of the Republic!""

The men cheered, and Antony began to wonder about the particulars of the arrangement.  The speech continued--the usual sort of rallying, are-you-with-us speech Caesar was so good at, and the men adored.  After Caesar had finished his speech, and they had resumed their march toward the city, Antony couldn't help but ask.

""There'll be confiscations, then?""

""No,"" said Caesar, patiently.

""We're going to need money,"" Antony pointed out.

""We'll need friends even more,"" said Caesar.  ""There'll be time later for proscriptions and confiscation, but for now, we are the ones who simply want peace and justice.  These things take time--move too soon, and the people lose faith in you.  Remember that.""

They rode into the city; Caesar had martial law declared to cut down on the looting of the abandoned homes of the wealthy, and the bread dole increased to make the poor less inclined to loot in the first place.  He had patrols set up through the city, to maintain order and enforce the curfew, but the bulk of the legion camped with him outside the walls.

""The people,"" he explained, ""are afraid of another tyrant.  We're not tyrants; we're maintaining order and peace.""

Antony did not camp with the legion beyond the first night, when an air of triumph ran through the encampment as the men celebrated their good fortune and the victory over the Optimates.  It wasn't that he disliked being with his men; he loved them, he loved the world of the soldier, he loved the drinking and fighting and easy camaraderie.  He was born to and a contented inhabitant of a world of men, but sometimes a man needs to be an envoy to the world of women.  He wasn't at home there, but he was welcomed, with his dashing uniform and the scent of battle.  That world had always shown him wonderful hospitality.

So he was back to Atia's house, to feasting and long, relaxing baths; and to being fawned over like the conquering hero he did not particularly feel himself to be at the moment.  He suspected that she was in love with the idea of a soldier, and blissfully unconcerned about the realities involved.  But he didn't mind that very much, as he was in love with the idea of a wealthy woman, and very much enjoyed the realities."

"event","The good thing about being a general, thinks Mark Antony, is that you get to ride at the head of the column, rather than trudge through the mud that thousands of feet and hooves have churned up before you.  Aside from that, he's rather sour on military service today.  It's January, it's cold, it's damp, it's muddy, and the mood among the men is nowhere near as spirited as it had been when Caesar had made his speech to them.

Many of them are wavering between uncertainty and fear.  They are, after all, every one of them, now an enemy of Rome.  They've <i>got</i> to win this, or they could all be killed.  There's no turning back, and yet... he's sure that at least some of the men are weighing the decision in their minds, whether, if Pompey and the Senate offered, they would desert Caesar.

Of course, to be given an offer like that, they would have to be able to <i>find</i> Pompey's forces.

Morale had been very high when Caesar had made his speech--everything makes much more sense when Caesar is speaking; he's got a gift for motivating his men.  It had held the legions together, during those long years in Gaul and the more recent tense waiting, and it's all that's holding them together now.

But they've been marching for what feels like an eternity, back towards Rome, and have yet to see any sign of Pompey or his legions.  They're trying to maintain the belief that it will be a surprise invasion, since they're not in the war season, and only Caesar would be willing to lead an attack under all these less-than-favorable conditions.

They're also outnumbered.  Very, very outnumbered.  One legion, already undermanned by casualties in Gaul, sickness and desertion, against however many men Pompey and the Senate can gather together.

He wishes they would just find the enemy and fight already.  He's having a hard time keeping his own morale up, and he hates the waiting.  He's cold, and tired, and sore, and he thinks there is a war season for a very good reason.  But he has faith in Caesar, and in his tactics, and knows that their course is the best possible one... unless Pompey and his men are staying out of sight and preparing to surround them.  The Thirteeth, and Caesar and Antony, are depending on the element of surprise, and the speed of their march from Ravenna to Rome.  If they can get there before Pompey can call in his forces, they might have a chance.

They'd sent a scouting party ahead of them, toward the city, to travel until resistance is met, and to deliver Caesar's terms.  They haven't seen the scouts since.  They could be captured, they could be dead, or they could, by some miracle, still be advancing toward the city.

Antony isn't afraid.  He's just impatient.  Caesar looks so calm, so confident, so unconcerned about the situation--as though Mars himself has spoken to him, and told him he will triumph.  Maybe he has.  All Antony knows is that they are still marching toward Rome, they have all become enemies of the Republic, and at some point in the future, they will be doing battle with men he despises.

He imagines having his enemies torn apart by dogs, and the thought cheers him.  He wonders whether any of the women he knows would enjoy being given a man's heart as a gift.

He wonders whether a heart is a sufficiently impressive gift, or if maybe a heart and some jewelry, perhaps, or expensive perfume, would be better.

He thinks of Atia.

He thinks of Medusa.

He thinks of Madolyn, and is fairly sure she <i>wouldn't</i> like being given a heart.

He thinks of Curio, and he continues to ride at Caesar's side toward Rome."

"event","Mark Antony's newfound grim determination had served him well, on his return to Rome.  A man <i>ought</i> to be somber in the face of the crumbling of the Republic, after all; but it wasn't the Republic he'd been thinking about.  No, he'd had more selfish concerns.

He'd been gathering his men anyway when Strabo had come with the news: the Senate would reconvene the next day, it would still be the same session, and he could give his veto then and have it be formally entered into the record.  It would keep Caesar from being officially declared an enemy of Rome, and it might prevent war.

But Mark Antony, whatever his enemies (and many of his friends) might think, is not a stupid man.  He despises politics and rhetoric, but that doesn't mean he has no skill at either of them.  Caesar may be lenient toward Antony's shortcomings, but he is fully aware of them, as Antony knows very well--if Caesar had genuinely wanted the negotiations to work out, he would've sent someone more diplomatic.  He'd sent Antony instead.

Sending Antony to negotiate peace is like sending a catapult to pick a flower.  Antony is well aware of that, and he knows Caesar is also.

So, he'd been sent to start a war without making it look intentional.  He can do that; all it means is not hiding his contempt for the nobles, or his loyalty to Caesar.  It means being himself, only more so.

Mark Antony is happy to oblige.

He thinks of the impending war, as he dines that evening with Atia and her family.  He regrets that the fighting will likely take place in Italy--he regrets it partly because, as one of the causes for the war, the people might hold whatever damage is done by either side against him; and partly because, since the locals will be Romans, there will be no spoils to be had, no slaves to take.  He owes a man a considerable amount of gold for a new set of armor he is having made, and he hopes he'll be able to afford it.

Later in the evening, as he is served more wine, he thinks about the particular spoils he has taken in past battles--the women, mostly.  He wonders what had happened to that girl he'd had in Syria, the one with the pox scars but the voice of a siren.  He wonders where that blonde he'd had in Gaul is tonight, the one who'd said she was the daughter of some tribal official or other.  He does <i>not</i> wonder whether war is the right course.

If Atia has noticed a change in him from how he'd been a few days earlier, she is too polite to say so.  If he holds her more tightly tonight, if his needs seem more urgent, she doesn't seem to mind.  And when he arises the next morning, to go to the Senate, the weight of the perspective the Atlantean wine had given him seems a little lessened.

He isn't surprised to be attacked, not really.  What surprises him is that Pompey would be so bold, so openly against Caesar; he hadn't thought the weasel had it in him.  He would have guessed that, if he were to be attacked, it would be by the men of some other nobleman... but it does not displease him that it was Pompey's men.  With a gesture so open as this, there's not a man in the city who would fault Caesar for declaring war on him.

As Antony rides for Ravenna, and Caesar's camp there, he no longer fears for his life.  Injured, and covered in blood--some of it his own, this time--he feels strangely immortal.  He will be the hero that his men--and the people of Rome--believe him to be.

He is Mark Antony, Caesar's right-hand man."

...and right into Atia, who had been on her way into the garden that he, in her view, had been emerging from.

She looks up at him, emotions unreadable, as usual, under her amiable veneer.  ""Changed your mind, my sweet?""

He isn't sure what to say to that, so he says the first thing that comes to mind.  ""Have you missed me?""

She laughs, her calculatedly polite society laugh that she brings out at parties, when she can't believe what someone has just said or done, but isn't willing to offend them by saying so.  ""Missed you, my sweet?  I was only a moment behind you, but yes, it did feel like an age.""

She is dressed exactly as she was when he had last seen her, and the servants in the room beyond are cleaning up the meal they had finished eating on that night, which seems to be the same night after all.  He hasn't missed the Senate meeting, and more importantly, he hasn't missed the war.

He becomes aware that she is staring at him.  He will not tell her what he has seen, where he has been.  If she can find the door on her own, then he will discuss his experiences with her, but for now, he will keep it to himself--his rivals might hear of it and think it a sign of madness, or weakness, or they might find a way there themselves, and he is not willing to share that sacred tavern with Cicero.

Nor with Atia, if he can help it.  A man needs to have some secrets.

He gives her his most charming smile, leaning in to murmur to her, lips nearly touching her ear.  ""I think, o lioness of Venus, that I would like a soak in the bath, if you would do me the honor of joining me...?""

""Mmmm.""  The smile that meets his is a satisfied one.  Best to let her feel she has power.

And it follows as it often follows; a pleasant time in the bath, a more pleasant time in bed, and then a deep and restful sleep.  It's good to be home again."

"event","And so it happened, for one reason or another, that Antony found himself unable to sleep.  He could not understand it, himself; the day had been long, but productive.  He had endured the interminably long ceremony cleansing and anointing him as Tribune of the People, and followed it with a more private feasting and celebration with Atia.  It was another step on the path of honor, for his career, so he should have been able to sleep the sleep of the satisfied; if nothing else, the carousing and... exertion that followed should have tired him out.  But there he was, in the small hours before dawn, awake.

He tried not to think.  When that failed, he climbed out of bed so as not to wake Atia, pulled a tunic on and moved slowly through the corridors toward the garden.

He missed being on campaign, maybe that was the problem.  In Gaul, Caesar was the law, and as Caesar's right hand Antony himself was the law too, in a way.  But here in the city, one could not simply have one's enemies flogged or crucified.  One had to be more civilized.  Mask one's intentions with the formal language of the Senate, and--gods, how tiresome.  Pompey, more like an old woman than any kind of man; and Cicero, yes, Cicero would pay one day for the insult he had done to Antony's family.

He wished they could simply settle it on the field, like men.  Like Hector and Achilles before the walls of Troy.  He let himself imagine it, for a moment--the sun shining on his golden chariot, on the blood of his enemies before it soaked into the sand.

He encountered one of the slaves on his way to the garden; the encounter shook Antony briefly from his reverie, and he asked the slave to bring him more wine.  Antony himself continued into the garden, settling into a chair in the moonlight and looking up at the sky.  War was coming, he could feel it.  He only hoped that it would not be over before he could return to Caesar."

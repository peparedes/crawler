"event","<lj-cut text=""Plot summary"">Plot up to after the Avatars remade the universe the way it was originally supposed to be has happened. Inspector Sheriden never raided the house, and the girls never had to use the alternate physical identities.

Phoebe works at the Bay Mirror writing Ask Phoebe. She never met or married Dex or Coop and never will. She doesn't know who Billie or Christy are.

She still lives in the manor with <a href=""http://freezethenpanic.livejournal.com"">Piper</a>, <a href=""http://mysweatershrunk.livejournal.com"">Paige</a>, Leo and the boys.

<a href=""http://redeem-myself.livejournal.com"">Cole Turner</a> was brought back by the Elders after he helped Piper, Leo, and Phoebe from Limbo. He was returned as fully mortal, and Phoebe found out on a fluke internet surf at work. They agreed to meet up for coffee, and as they always were, found themselves back in love and on the track they were meant to be on.

At a Halloween party thrown by Studio 60, Phoebe and Paige mingled with celebrities and drank at the open bar. When Paige wandered off a previously invited Cole came to say his hellos, they ducked into a corner and made out like 15 year olds, then left and spent a steamy night at the Studio City Hilton. On the drive back from LA to San Francisco, Cole spontaniously pulled over and proposed in an orchard. Phoebe accepted.

Cole then took Phoebe surprise engagement ring shopping at Tiffanys in Union Square. She's a slut for diamonds, apparently.

Phoebe then told her sisters Cole had returned (magically leaving out the engagement) and Piper invited him over to dinner. Said dinner occured, where <a href=""http://telekinetics.livejournal.com"">Chris</a> showed up because Paige had contacted him to freak out about Cole and Phoebe. Chris then rambled on about his future and how he must've been sent back to an alternate timeline. And, as is par in the Halliwell household, a demon attacked baby Wyatt. A drunken Paige hit him with a carving knife and he left. Phoebe took said knife and Cole to the attic to make a potion, which exploded and knocked them unconscious, unknowingly embuing Cole with the ability to teleport and left Phoebe unaffected.

Upcoming plot:
Cole finds out his new powers
Phoebe and Cole get married
Mirrorverse sisters attempt to turn Cole and take him back through to their universe

OOC NOTE!!
If you want to have my Phoebe play in your games, let me know via email (her lj email is fine). I'll be sure to get back to you. Links to posts in which plot occured can be found in memories. Enjoy your reading. Don't critique unless asked. Don't steal anything. I don't own Phoebe/Alyssa Milano (oh how I'd like to)/Charmed/The WB or CW or it's affiliates, but all this plotty fun is part mine, intellectual property and all that stuff. Yadda yadda. Enjoy the crack."

"event","Is it odd that there are more than 5 people I'd do that for?

I sometimes think it is...

I'd give my life up for any one of my sisters, including Prue. I'd die for my brother-in-law, for both of my nephews (present or future [don't ask]). I'd die for Cole, too.

That last one throws me a little. I know that my sisters would never allow that to happen without ending up killing Cole, whether it was his fault or not. I know that, but I'd still do it. But, then again, if you'd asked me that question a few months ago, I'd have <b>never</b> said yes. I was still in the mindset that he was dead and never coming back, so it wouldn't matter anyway, and I was still in denial about how in love with him I still was.

But that's neither here nor there.

The simple answer is that there are many people I think deserve to live if my life is the trade. Sure, maybe I have this big 'destiny' thing to live up to, and I'm supposed to be around to fulfill it, but so are they. The Elders don't do anything without the endgame in mind, so my life is no more important than anyone I love.

"event","Phoebe had been nervous all day, waking up early, cleaning the house in the most haphazard and sporatic way possible. Any time she saw Paige or Piper, she'd annoyingly remind them of the fact that Cole was human and they had to not hurt him. Soon, she was finding herself obnoxious and made herself stop, heading outside for a brisk walk around the block.

When she returned, she found everything in place, Piper putting the finishing touches on dinner, Leo entertaining the boys, and Paige putting away the cleaning products Phoebe had littered throughout the manor.

Phoebe finally settled in the kitchen, watching Piper cook with a smile. She appreciated her sister making dinner, and she started to tell her so when the doorbell rang. Phoebe's face immediately turned to concern, and she leap to her feet again, rushing to get the door before anyone else did.

""I GOT IT!!"" She raced through the front hall, dodging around Paige and getting to the door, letting out a deep breath before opening it. When she was greeted with Cole looking more nervous than she felt, she smiled softly.

""Hi. Come in."" She shuffled backwards to give him space to enter the manor.

"event","""Oh, crap, sorry!"" Coffee dribbled down the front of her shirt, the CD she'd just burned with her article on it in her hand, and the sports writer she'd just crashed into. With a heavy sigh, Phoebe set her mug down and went for the stack of paper towels on the table holding the coffee machine and fixings.

Her eyes were far away, distracted as she wiped uselessly at the stain on her white shirt, thinking about the Halloween party and it's fantastic aftermath, the meetup on the pier, her secretive conversations with Cole. She knew her sisters had noticed how differently she was acting, Phoebe still getting questioned by Paige on who she'd ducked out with at the Halloween party and where she'd gone. The lies were swiftly running out, and she knew it was time to let them in on what had been going on.

Instead of helping the guy she'd crashed into clean himself up, she darted into her office, grabbing her purse and nearly running out of the office. She drove home at an unsafe pace, dodging around double-parked cars and trucks, taking turns fast enough to make her tires squeal. With a jolting stop she pulled into the driveway behind Paige's Bug, then ran into the house.

""Paige? Piper? I need to talk to you guys!!"" She had to get it off her chest now, or she'd never do it, and too much time would pass for her sisters to understand.

They'd only remained at the party for maybe 20 minutes after Cole had arrived. Something had gotten into Phoebe, maybe the general vibe running through the party effecting her mood enough that all she wanted to do was maul Cole, or maybe it was just having not seen Cole in a few days. Whatever the case, they'd agreed it was the best idea to leave the party before Paige saw them.

Once out in Cole's car, Cole announced he had no idea where to go. Phoebe pondered for a second, her brain cloudy with alcohol and trying to keep her hands to herself. She looked around for anything familiar, coming up empty. ""Well, I know this one hotel, near the airport. I was there was Jason awhile... ago..."" She stopped, wincing slightly. ""Err... Maybe you and I should go elsewhere."" She thought for a second, taking out her phone and pulling up the web browser. She knew the address from the party pass, and looked up hotels in the area.

""There is a Hilton in Studio City, which according to the map is that way."" She studied the screen of her cell phone, then pointed in a vaguely western direction. ""Let's go there. Ummmm.. Turn left."" She grinned at him, reaching over and pushing her fingertips through his hair.

"event","Kira had shown it to her. A world where she didn't have to fight demons, where she was happy, and she had a daughter. Just the idea of it had obsessed her. When their deal with the Avatars had gone awry, Phoebe still held onto the idea that it could happen.

She'd obsessed over the idea of her would-be daughter. Dating too many men, none of them turning out to be anyone she'd want to be dating, let alone possibly marrying and having a child with. Yet, still, she focused on it and nearly nothing else.

Her job suffered some, her writing becoming hurried and out of character. Magic was the last thing on her mind, leaving Piper and Paige to take care of as much as they could before Paige would orb in on one of her dates to bring her home for a Power of Three spell.

Phoebe had changed. While her top priority was still family, it'd become the one she was destined to create that was more important to her than anything else. Simply because she was ready for a daughter. She wanted the Halliwell line to continue through her as well as Piper and Leo, and eventually Paige. She wanted magic to keep it's strength through the Halliwell line. She was convinced that her finding the man that she was meant to be with was the best thing to do.

Beyond that, she wanted to know she could still love someone, someone that wouldn't die in a preordained number of days that she knew. Her focus had become all about herself, and people around her were beginning to suffer.

"event","He was alive.

It'd thrown Phoebe a whole lot more than she'd expected, but she was focused, her mind going to one track and igoring everything around her. She'd gone to the recent phone book immediately and found his listing, tearing it out of the book and stuffing it into her pocket. Not like Paige or Piper would be looking the in C section any time soon, but it was always an option.

And she didn't want Paige to immediately go off about how the only reason he could be back was evil. A nagging voice (that sounded like Paige now) was eating at her, trying to make her not do what she wanted to, was she was planning to. Phoebe ignored it, knowing what she was doing was necessary.

After all, it was only coffee, right? No real danger there.

A few days passed, and Phoebe finally gathered herself together enough to retrieve the piece of paper from the drawer she'd hidden it in, then she grabbed her cell phone and sat on her bed. For an hour. Dialing, her finger hovering over the green send key before she'd beg out and close the flip on her phone.

Finally, she dialed, pressed send, and listened to the ringing as her heart nearly exploded out of her chest.

When an answering machine picked up, she let out a low sigh and laughed quietly to herself. Hearing his voice sent chills up her spine. The beep came, and she left a message.

""Cole. Hi. Um... [awkward laugh] It's me, Phoebe. Uh... You probably knew that already. Um... Uh... Anyway, I just wanted to give you the information on coffee. If you're free tomorrow, about 2pm, let's meet at that little coffee place on Pier 39 we went to a few times. I'll wait for you there until 3. I hope I see you. Um... Okay. Yeah. Bye. OH! This is my cell number, if you have caller ID. Bye.""

She hung up and threw her phone away from her onto the bed, feeling like a 12 year old who'd just managed to call her crush.

After hardly sleeping, she was fidgety at work. When 1:30 rolled around, she logged out of her computer and forwarded her phone lines to the answering service, heading out of the office before anyone could catch her and tell her they needed her.

When she arrived at the coffee shop, she ordered water and took it outside, walking to the end of the Pier outside the coffee shop, smiling down the sea lions piled on floating docks. She was early, so she waited nervously, watching people as they milled by.

"event","Uh, I think I kinda have to believe in destiny, fate, all it's sidebranches. Whatever you want to call it, I have to believe in it.

I've met the damned angel of destiny, ferfuckssake.

I have a path, and no matter how hard I try to deviate from it, I'm pulled back into it. Whether it's my sisters, my sense of duty (I'm still wondering when that showed up... Damned being a grownup), or just a general feeling of doom unless I go the way things are pushing me, I go. I do. I take care of what needs to be done.

Yes, it's caused parts of my life to suffer. I can't keep a relationship going to save my life. Y'know, unless they're willing to be in on the crazy. And the only person I've found that truly wanted to be in on the crazy? He was evil. And now he's dead.

I accepted my fate long ago. Even when I was offered a chance to change everything and never have to do what I do, it didn't work out right, and here I was again. It's just easier to deal with it as it comes rather than fight everything before it gets here.

I've nearly given up on love. Halliwell women just can't seem to be happy for long before something takes it away. Look at Piper and Leo. They're basically the perfect couple, and if they can't make it work, what hope do any of us have? Close to none, I think.

I would kill for my sisters. I <i>have</i> killed for my sisters, actually. More like vanquishing, but y'know. If it meant giving up my own life, I'd still do it.

In fact, I think I've done that too....

We have far too crazy lives, us Halliwells."

"event","<b>Movie based on my life.</b>

I'm not sure a movie based on my life, or our lives, as it were, would be that good of an idea. I think it might be long, overly angsty, and kinda boring in parts. But since it's a challenge to think of one, hey, why not?

Casting I'd leave in someone elses hands, someone with an outsiders perspective that can just look at us and see something other than what I see. I see sisters, and they'd have to play themselves. I see family, or I see foes, and I can't just <i>cast</i> someone to play them. I mean, who would I have play Prue? No idea. Who would I have play the demon that KILLED Prue? NO IDEA! So that would have to be left to someone else, someone without the emotional attachment.

What areas would I want to have covered in that movie? Us first getting our powers and learning exactly who we are, that would have to be in there. The death of Prue, no matter how painful. The entrance of Paige in our lives. The love story between Piper and Leo. The birth of Wyatt. Pretty much all of the milestones in all of our lives would have to be in it, and well, that would make the movie a few hours long.

There are many subplots that would have to be considered too, one of them being my relationship with Cole. It changed us all, whether for the better or worse no one is quite sure yet. Chris coming into our lives would have to be in there too, even though he is a huge pain in the ass and I think we'd all rather not have lost Leo to the Elders. But hey, everything happens for a reason, right?

Huh.. I could go on and on about all the different things that have happened and will happen, but then I'd be giving away all the secrets, wouldn't I?"

"event","Dear _____-

Not sure who to address this to, really. Elders? Grams? Santa? Some other woodland sprite hell bent on giving us things? Like I said, not sure.

All I want this year is for everything to stop. The attacks, the people we love being killed or leaving us for some reason that has never really been clear, the fighting, everything.

I want Wyatt to grow up as normally as he can. I want my nephew to be happy, and to never know the hurt we've had to endure. I want Piper to be able to raise her son, with his father, and BE HAPPY again. I want Paige to know what it's like to just have sisters, without having to worry about making potions or keeping the Book up to date, or living the life she leads now. Just to have us, me and Piper, and know what it's like to just <i>be</i> with family, not worrying about defending them.

I want to know that Prue is all right. Somewhere, deep down, I know she is. She's fine, watching us and guiding us with a steady hand, but to see her like we can see Mom and Grams.. That would be spectacular.

Please, just bless us all and make sure we make it through anything in the future safely.

And please, since he's back and I don't have much to say about that, let Cole leave us alone. Let him move on from the past, and let us move forward as well. I don't want to have to hurt him again, but I will, and that's not something that I want to arise.

Thank you, and Blessed Be.
-Phoebe"

"event","<b>Describe a dream that you've had. How did the dream make you feel?</b>

She woke with a start, her heart pounding. Her sheets were tangled around her, constricting her and giving her a general feeling of claustrophobia. Phoebe closed her eyes, letting out a long breath, then made herself unravel the sheets and get out of bed.

It was the same dream as always, lately. Phoebe opened her bedroom door to a dark hall, and headed toward the stairs. She padded down quietly, taking a right turn and heading into the kitchen. She filled the teapot and set it on the burner, then reached up and pulled down a box of tea and a mug from the cabinet. With a sigh, she turned the burner on, watching the blue flame flicker for a second before turning around and pulling a teabag out of the box and letting it drop into the empty mug.

Leaning against the counter, she raised a hand to her forehead and paused, running the dream through her head again.

She was in a car with someone, a woman. Someone she knew. They were out at the bay, driving along the Embarcadero toward one of the more touristy areas of San Francisco. They were laughing, enjoying themselves, and Phoebe watched people walking down the street, people in cars driving past, the different piers flashing by. She then reached to roll down the window, and she had a premonition. A blurred image, dark, grainy. Under water. The woman she was with trying to claw her way through the glass of the windshield.

Snapping back to the present, she tells the woman to stop, to pull over. The woman just looks at her, still laughing, as if she can't hear a word Phoebe just said. Phoebe becomes insistant, panicked. Pull over, pull over now. The woman ignores her. They head up a small, winding road up along a cliff overlooking the Pacific. Phoebe's cries of desperation are muted.

A man in black appears in the middle of the road. The woman swerves, and they go off the edge of the road. Phoebe feels the churning in her stomach, like when someone goes over a large hill on a rollercoaster. She's screaming. The woman next to her is unconscious now, blood trickling down her forehead and across her eyebrow. As they hit the water, Phoebe hears a high pitched whistle.

Phoebe's eyes snapped open and she was back in the Halliwell kitchen. The teapot was screaming at her, letting her know the water was ready. Mindlessly, still thinking about the dream, she lifted the teapot off the burner, switching off the heat at the same time, then poured her tea. Sighing again, she felt the same fear, worry, and nausea in the pit of her stomach she always felt when she thought back on the dream.

<i>I should tell Piper and Paige.</i> Sitting down at the counter, Phoebe decided that she would finish her tea, then try to sleep again. If the dream came again, she'd look through the Book of Shadows for anything related, then tell her sisters."

"event","<b>What is one thing you have learned from your past?</b>

""Hey, Piper? You seen my car keys?""

Even the power of premonition couldn't keep her absent-mindedness in check. Phobe hunted around the entrance of the manor, lifting items and replacing them slightly skewed. Brow furrowed, she kept a close watch on the clock and was moving as fast as she could, but nothing doing.

""PIPER!! HAVE YOU SEEN MY KEYS?!?!?"" Her appointment was in 20 minutes, and to make it there on time with city traffic, she was cutting it more than close. She was probably going to end up being late.

Piper came down the stairs, reached over the railing, and with a jingle was holding Phoebes keys by the ring. <i>""You need to take better care of your things, sis.""</i> Phoebe reached up and grabbed them from her, giving her a quick grin.

""Thank you."" She quickly ran up the 3 bottom stairs, gave Piper a quick kiss on the cheek, and ran out the front door, letting it slam closed behind her. As she started the car, and rolled out of the driveway into the street, she thought back to when Prue was still alive, and she was the youngest sister. Prue would've found Phoebe's keys on the table, and hidden them on her to teach her a lesson in responsibility. Piper would've found out and scolded Prue. Now, it was Phoebe trying to teach her younger sister lessons, and Piper still stepping in.

Piper had always been the mother of the clan, after their real mother died. She'd always been the one to hold things together, and after Prue died, Phoebe wasn't sure they would be able to cope, to make it through. But in that time, Phoebe had learned just how strong the Halliwell women were, and how much they could withstand.

The loss of a sister. The gaining of a new, untrained sister. The different relationships that filtered in and out of their lives. All things they could withstand together, and grew stronger from.

As Phoebe made her way through the traffic, she smiled. Love, that was what her past had shown her. Love would make it through nearly anything put in front of it, even things that should break it in two. When she stopped at a light, Phoebe made a quick right turn and headed back to the house. She pulled into the driveway, jumped out of the car, ran inside, and threw her arms around Piper. She hugged her long and tight, then pulled back and smiled.

""Gotta go. I love you."""

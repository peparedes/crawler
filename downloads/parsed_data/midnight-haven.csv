"event","So I have broken up with my now ex-boyfriend Aaron. And I have to say that I actually feel happy without him in my life............. intimately that is. I would love to keep him as a friend. I was just so miserable with him. But I have found some one else that makes me happy. I hope I make him happy too......"

"event","I can't believe how much I have changed in the last few  months. I have managed to hold on to a relationship for a little over four months now (which is a surprise no more to anyone than myself)with just one person, and I am getting more efficient in my job. I am so close to a management position, I can taste it. I feel like I am falling for my baby Aaron. I know he has fallen hard for me. I am not ready for this though. I do not want anything serious, but I find myself slowly becoming incredibly attached to him. I think he is in love with me. I am not sure if I feel so close yet. He irritates the HELL out of me more often than not. Hopefully I can learn to be more tolerant and he will learn how to OBEY! OH yeah, and I just got an edition to my family. My little baby Dakota. My sweet puppy. Her recovery from the heartworm treatment isn't going so well. Yeah, keeping her as little excited as possible for 4 weeks is going to be no picinic. I want to kill the bastard that abandoned her and let her starve, ultimately leading to her heartworms. Oh well. She has a second chance, and god as my witness, she will get the treatment and love and life she so deserves."

"event","I have been seeing this man that I met through a good friend of mine. He really makes me happy and I enjoy spending time with him. The only problem is that he lives in Houston and he has to drive so far just to spend time with me. I miss him terribly and I can't wait to see him again. I can't thank enough the beautiful friend that set us up. She really did good with this one. ;)"

"event","Well I am not depressed as badly as I was before, although one of my favorite people isn't talking to me. Maybe he will, maybe... Anyway, I'm going to put my feet forward and try not to wallow in this pool of darkness. Thanks to a good friend of mine, Elizabeth, i am now seeing things in a different light and more clearly. So now I will try to make things happen, instead of wondering why things are happening as they are. Do I make any sense?"

"event","I am so depressed I could just kill myself. (crying will just have to do.) Last night i had gotten into an argument with the only person that will ever truly love me. My beloved Jack. I think I cried last night for 2 hours. He wants to be with me and just can't do that right now. I love him like I have never loved anyone. I'm so stupid...! He said that I am too absorbed in myself and my my sorrows to allow true happiness to ever exist for me. He said that we will have to talk when he returns from Germany. Until then...

I am also feeling the real world blues. I don't make enough money at work to buy a car or go to acting school. Hell, I gained weight when I moved out from my parents house (Fucking Porker!!!) and I can't fit any of my clothes, and I can't afford a new wardrobe. Goddamn. I have no one here. There is nobody here to listen to me or to save me from this. Nobody to tell me that I am going to be alright. I have anybody here that really cares about me. Yesterday when I was blubbering over Jack, my brother came home with his new love interest heather. I wanted to talk to him, to tell him what happened and how upset I was. I couldn't, because she was here. I didn't want to tell him my woes with her standing there because let's face it, I don't know her, and I didn't want to ruin the undeniably ""happy"" mood she put him in. The trouble is... he's really the only one I have here. He's probably going to be seeing her alot which means that I'll have nobody. Not his fault I suppose. That's the thing, all this stuff that is hitting me, all these problems I am having, are all on me. I am the cause of them. I guess that is why it hurts so much. I was always one to be all alone, on my own. I guess I got use to the comfort of having someone be there for me. Needless to say, I feel helpless being totally and utterly alone."

They're just boys, and I don't want to mess with little boys right now. There is one guy in particular that I do have an interest in. His name is Mike and he seems really cool. He and I are suppose to get together and hang out. I don't know, maybe he likes me..........."

"event","HAPPY NEW YEAR! What is my New Year's resolution you ask? To have a better fucking year than the last. Actually, my resolution is to get into shape before the summer, even though I don't even come out in the summer, and to save up for a car by the end of the year. Those are pretty good goals, wouldn't you agree?"

"event","Well, good news kiddies. I talked to one of my managers, Joanna, and she said that it wasn't good for me to come in at 6:00a.m. right after I got off at midnight. So needless to say, she fixed it and I only have to work till nine on Sunday. Well now that that is out of the way I can tell you about the bad thing that happened today. I had a customer come through my line with her husband and I was not in a good mood considering I'd been on my feet all day on new year's eve! Well anyway she, I guess, wondered why I wasn't in a fucking good mood. She said ""well you're just not a happy camper."" I said ""I guess I could be better."" I scan her stuff as fast as I could and I had a really slow bagger. Her chips I guess got stuck behind something and got crushed a little(because my bagger was slow and couldn't keep up with me) and the lady,or bitch, said ""can you be a little more careful with chips , yea don't do that to those."" Well anyway they have an item that they couldn't get on their list of godly long coupons. They tell me this after I'm done ringing and totaling up their groceries and giving them their receipt. I tell them ""I don't know how to handle that(because the department that had the goddamn item they needed should have handled it), but you can go to the business center before it closes at 8:00 which is in a few minutes."" Well after they leave about ten minutes later I'm told that one of my managers, Mary Jane-whom I must say I despise beyond belief, I find her utterly annoying and I frankly just plain don't like her, wants to speak with me. Well I find her and she pulls me to the side to basically to tell me that the customer that I just spoke of before had a problem with the way I rung up her groceries(the chips) and that I wasn't very helpful in telling them how to get the item they could not get. I was never, first of all, taught how to deal with exchanging one item for another that a customer could not get, and second of all, the only thing that I really didn't do for those two was smile. Anyway I don't think it is going to go on my record or anything ,but I was still pretty pissed that the lady and her husband complained about me because I wasn't in a good mood. If you were on your feet all day dealing with customers and their ever varying moods and complaints and what not, for eight hours, you wouldn't be in a good fucking mood either lady!(bitch!). It's hard to get that through to people sometimes that their not the only customer nor the first one you've had to deal with, or, that you've been on your feet all day and you have'nt slept or eaten all day, and you just want to go home. Oh fucking well. Anyways, sorry this entry was so long, I just had to get it all out before I explode with rage and fury."

"event","My brother, Shaun, is ordering the upcoming Pride PPV this Sunday, which promises to have some awesome matches. He's inviting our friends Elizabeth and Mando over to join the excitement. The only thing that absolutely ruins this great night is that I have to work Sunday from 4:00p.m. to midnight. My brother was so sweet; he said we could catch a late showing of it so that I could get a chance to see it. I thought that was wonderful. Well that was a day ago. I hadn't gotten my schedule for next week until today. To my shock and discovery, it turns out that the day after the fight, or I should say the morning(Monday), I am scheduled to work from 6:00a.m.(yes that says a.m.) to 10:00a.m. So I get off at midnight only to turn around and go right back to work at 6:00 in the morning. So now I can't even watch the late showing of the goddamn PPV or stay up and chat with Elizabeth and Mando. I'm pretty sure you're supposed to have at least eight hours between shifts. I will be taking this up with management, and if they give me any trouble, then I will just go over their heads and take my complaint to a higher power. mwa ha ha ha!"

"event","I can't even believe I am even awake this early. I am usually unconscious until 1:00 or 2:00. Anyway I am happy that I am off today. I don't have to deal with customers and their petty nonsense. People get on my very last nerves. It's strange though... I feel that I am good person who just hates stupid people. That's okay right? I mean it's not my fault that I am not always in a happy mood. My work almost flat out demands that you put on a happy face for the customers. I don't always have one. In fact, I rarely have one. Do you want to know why? I'll tell you. I  don't have on a happy face because of my anger with the FUCKING CUSTOMERS!"

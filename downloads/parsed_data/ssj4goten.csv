When your younger you cant afford all the cool shit and you have to get your parents to by it for you which is cool. now I dont have a clue..well scince I bought Season 2 of Enterprise which am almost at the end off the 3rd season comes out the start of September, scince I cant be arsed spending another 60 quid ill just get them to do it. Dont like not walking up and not getting nothing...anyway I dont care scince its another day thats all, except am gonna be old now :-(, dont wanna turn 20, itl just be gay like everything else.  Think thats what ill ask them for, mum was saying about getting me a chain but the last 2 turned black so am just not gonna bother with another one now. And its just dawned on my that its me wee bros birthday on the 15th which means am gonna have to get the wee shit something. Uhhhh....
Cant find anyone to go and see Cradle Of Flith on december, no one knows who they are at my work and the only person who said she would go is the person that said she would go to the nightish gig and she never did. SO am not too optimistic about it. I'll go myself if need be but I still dont know were the Carling is even after ive been twice lol.
Work has been not too bad, today I got hummed with naggets and sandwitches, must of had at least 30 on at one top and then my stupid head came one......

(""Stupid Head""; A short period of time where on all conclusion your head goes straight up your ass and you start fannying about and laughing too much)

....yeah not a good time.

Mellissa was there to help as NO one else bothered, shes been getting nicer to work with now, I no longer want to dip her head in the friers lol. We did a few breakfast shifts together aswell which were suprisingly not too bad aswell. She starts college bk soon aswell and both of us cant wait to getting back to working weekend lol. Had a good laugh today but the minute her and Lizzie get together they gang up on me...not that I mind, she can assault me all she wants lol.

Also getting worried about college, certificates are due to com out soon and I better have passed or else I am royaly fucked. LEast if I fail i dont have to see Carolyn again. She said she might not be going back and part if me is hoping she will stay away. She put me off my work so many times last year that I was amazed that I got anything done..well..that and playing Eve Online religiously lol, had to cancel it in january cause I was getting nothing done lol, go me lol! Mostly been plkaying Guild Wars and Counter Strike on the pc, am training my wee cous how to play First Person Shooters and to see the least he gets his ass kicked online, then I jump on and PWN everyone.

Anyway am running out things to type about and in all this time typing this I havnt looked at the keyboard anymore than a douzen times, learing how to type without looking at the keyboard..going not to bad...well 13 times then."

It was johns last day today which is sad cause hes a cool guy and funny as fuck lol. At the end of the night we put him in a rubbush bin and threw frier extrament over him, along with vinagar, flour (me lol) and lots of other stuff. Got pictures and everything lol. He was a good sport about it and was halarious. 
At the end of the night I was cleaning with Lizzie and Louise, was sooo good to talk to her even through she slapped water on my face lol, was nice just to be myself around her. About 5 of us stayed behind including me and we just sat around talking, shes so random lol.

Speaking of random I got a love letter on a napkin from a customer in at work lol, Frasier came through and says someone left that for you, its got a whole list of bands on the front, including NIGHTWISH which is aweome but some I dont like aswell lol..like HIM...hmm...It says on the inside ""Jamie luvs the chef with long hair""....I was like ok...not till 10 i opened it up full and it had a number inside it aswell haha. Couldnt believe it lol, never happpened to me before, must have saw me when I was talking to David before I started my shift. Its prob gonna be a 40 yr old man or something like that but meh I got nothing to lose. Might phone it tomorrow while im at work..David said the she was hot so am all for it.

Nothing really exciting has happened in the boring life of Stephen, walked to the doctors today to saee about stuff for my hayfever which i got, I was going to mention something about my heart and the chest pains but I decided not to.

Kerry phoned me lastnight for only the 2nd time scince we broke up, at 1am I sat to watch a dvd and the minute it came on my phone went lol. Was nice to talk to her again and she was just phoning to say hello which was sweet, she couldnt talk for long but it was nice. Shes back together with her boyfriend am glad about, she needs someone to turn to.

On that note the manager that found out that i liked lizzie put her on sweets today just because of me! This is why I didnt want anyone to know! She hates sweets and am gonna make sure that the manager knows not to do it again, I dont like when people who get in my buissness and dont get their noses out of it. Shes just trying to help and its sweet of her but i dnt want her to keep doing it. Didnt get the chance to talk to her either cause we were so busy and the sweat was absolutly running off me it was so warm. Siobhan gave me a nice big hug when i came in today which was nice lol.

This week has been pretty hectic, trying to get all the college work finished but i think i got everything done. I dont know, the teacher said shed phone us this week to tell us if we have anything else to do, I really hope i dont but meh.

Realised that my last entry was the night of the staff party, well no it wasnt i wrote this pure gay one and ended up deleting it, am such a tit.
Nothing has really happened with liz since then, had a good chat with her today but its the only chance i got the whole weekend, so gay. One of the girl managers has been trying to find out who i like for the past  2 month, i decided fuck it so i told her, she got all giggly and said that she'd sooo would, what she meant i had no idea but i never took a notice lol. Other than that work has been shit, I also wondered today the the sexual harrasment to girls in my work is soom appauling is not even funny, I counted so many times were all the guys were just being complete assholes and just being totally disrespectfull to them. Theres this really nice looking new girl that started (who goes to my college and has been for the past 2 year, only saw her on monday haha) and she takes hairdressing or something like that, and i lost count on how many times she got slapped in the ass and people touching her up, I stood there going wtf! 
Theres 4 things i cant stand....Lying, Spitting, Smoking and Disrespectfull people, it wasnt just her, most of the girls get it aswell. So fucking crap.

Ive got my dad telling me to et driving lessons all the time now, ad i dont just mean once a day but i mean every single time i walk into a room and is getting pretty fucking tiring! you would think he would have taken a hint now but obviously not.

But then Lizzie came in and was dressed like a princess, she just looked abolsutly...beautiful...i wish i told her that.

Carolyn got takin into hospital on monday after college and she was getting her tonsils taking out after waiting almost 2 years, fucking nhs piece of shit. I remember feeling so bad for her when she walked out the door and she gave me a wee sad wave. She went in on tuesday and was practically asleep for the whole day lol, lucky bugger. Talked to her on wednesday and when I say talk I mean at least 50 txt messages in one day, thats never happened before and i was ready to through my phone out the bloody window but she needed cheering up so I stick with it. Shes got worse today and can hardly speak, hopefully shel get better.
College has been the hite of boring this week, weve been doing the same thing for the pat 5 days! over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again!!
This is the last week and ive still got animation to finish and any stuff that I get back, shouldnt be too bad. Am gonna tell me work that i dont stop for another 2 weeks so i can actually get a wee break before the summer hell starts at work.

And now getting to work, first off all I had to work with Mel today, which i thought might not be too bad and it realy wasnt, but she wouldnt stop potting at me and insulting me every chance she got! I had to hold me self back from punching her in the face, I was brought up not to hit girls and you shouldnt but my god she was so pushing the wrong buttons on me today and she almost hit the fight back button. If i was to knock her on her ass I would love it, but I cant. Thats another thing while am at it, woman moan for equal rights, equal pay and equal jobs which is all well and good, but when they get put into the army and get put on the front lines of a war they moan about how they shouldnt be there! You made your bed so live with it, read that in the newspaper today and it just got me angry lol.

Am not gonna moan my face off about lizzie cause ive given up, staff party tomorrow and i aint going, shes still got ma dvd though."

Working late in diner Citylite, I see that you get home alright
Make sure that you can't see me, hoping you will see me

Sometimes I'm Wondering why you look me and you blink your eye
You can't be acting like my Dana

Obsessed by you, your looks, well, anyway ""I would any day die for you"",

Still I sit in diner Citylite, drinking coffee and reading lies
Turn my head and I can see you, could that really be you

I see, can't have you, can't leave you there 'cos I must sometimes see you

"event","I hate the fucking head chef! the wee skiving perverted dickhead! I would give anything just to punch him right in the middle of the face. He's a skiving judemental idiot and I hate every minute I spend working with him. You run up to girls every time they walk into the kitchen and get them to hug you and kiss you when they clearly dont like you! Why dont you just do your job and stop wasting my time and everyone elses, leave! that would be better, know one likes you and I would give my soul for you to hit me so I can clobber you back and leave you lying on the floor. If you pull any of your shit tomorrow I will break your arms and watch you work with them danglying off. When you hugged lizzie and she looked at me with sheer terror in her eyes ive never wanted to through out infront of a car more!

I want nothing more than to walk upto you and just out right tell you how I feel and let everyone know how happy you make me, ovcourse I miss you when your out the front, theres know one to make me smile when I dont see you. I really really wish you knew, everytime we catch eyes I wanna shout it out but the wee bastard is here watching and I cant get rid of him. Am starting to care about you more and more and it can only lead to one thing, something im all too familer with but I dont care."

"event","Star Wars lastnight was absolutly amazing! 

First of all I went to alans at 9 and we basically sat and played halo until it was time to leave, I won again ovcourse and he just aint a challenge anymore lol. We left at quater past 11 and walked down through the bellfield estate and the pouring rain and pitch black and ive never walked so bloody fast in all my life lol...well maybe on the way home. We went to the odeon and it was locked, so we went to asda to get some sweetie supplies before we went in, I heard someone say ""stevie!"", I turned around and it was graham and david haha, turned out they were just out from work and were going to see it aswell...amazing!! So I get a packet of cola bottles and mintrils and some irn bru and i was all set.
When we actually got into the cinema I saw like half a douzen people from work!!, there was Fraser, Sparky, John and James who left and hadnt seen in ages. I thought they were going to the one in glasgow but they went to killie instead. There was a guy dressed as Darth Vader and someone as Yoda, we just looked at them but also wanted to by them a drink lol. SO we went in and it was mobbed! every seat was full and it was a great atmosphere, never been to a cinema when it was packed. First of all I dropped ALL of my minstrils in the first 10 MINUTES of the film which was total gay! I was ragin, it was like a machine gun sound when it fell on the floor and I was just like ohhh dammit. Now to the move....
the best star wars in my opinion was Empire Strikes Back because Lucas didnt direct it, but this movie was equal to it and it is the best of the prequels by far. Its so dark and some of the twist are quite cool. There was so many good bits that use will just have to see it for yourself.

By the time it finished and we got out it was 3 oclock so we had to walk back to alans in the pouring rain!!! and also through the estate again this time colder, darker and later. It was awesome though lol Was gonna txt Miss Fairy but didnt know if shed be up so i didnt want to wake her. Finally got to his bit and jumped on my bike and got home at quater to 4 and i had college at 7, was so not in the mood but i had to go today and am glad i did, got alot done but still so much to do.

Gonna hit my bed soon, so tired and ive got college tomorrow"

Not thinking bout Lizzie as much which is awesome cause it just makes me feel depressed, staff party on sunday and am still deciding weither or not to go, its right after my shift ends and i know I just wont be in the mood to hang around with drunk 16-19 yr olds, even if I like one of them.
Been talking to Carolyn again on msn alot and it reminds me why I liked her, got the bus with her aswell for like the first time on about a month, for some reason she always seems to get the one before me like shes in a hurry but she decided to wait today and it was nice. GLad were friends again.

My heart has been hurting alot today, and I dont mean like someones hurt my feeling I mean like a stabbing pain every time it beats, it only happens for like 5 mins at a time but bu god does it hurt like hell. Thought it never meant anything but it happened a dew days ago at college, this was including a cold sweet at the same time. Prob just one of these things I get.....stupid body.

College wasnt too bad today, got most of my 3D animation stuff finished which is good, some stupid teacher tried to get us to go to this job thing on wednesday on my day off, no ones going cause ive got too much work to do and I dont know if am working...then the stupid bitch carolyn turns round to me and goes ""why dont u go stephen, as if your working""....I was like what the fuck bitch!

"event","Feel abit better today, not been the usual depressing Stephen for a change. Dont know whats been with me, I think its cause I kinda maybe a wee touch miss ma family, house is quit and not having anyone to come home to. Another reason I think is Lizzie, she was the only reason I bothered to drag myself into that place and now shes no longer ""The girl I like"" but ""The girl I like with a boyfriend"", its been really depressing cause she really does make me happy. She properly doesnt even think about me or give me a 2nd thought and am getting like this because of her, its Carolyn all over again and its pissing me off. Even if she knew I liked her it wouldnt be so bad...but I cant tell her. May aswell have to suffer it, no one to blame but myself...

Bonnie has made it clear that shes not interested in anything more than being friends which to be honest is kind of a relief. Havnt spoken to her in ages but she cleared some things up which is cool with me..its better this way and am happy to keep it like this.

Got alot of college work to do and ive done some 3D tonight but it looks so crap cause ive got none of my textures cause there all in college.......gay. Got 2 NX ships done and they look good, but my sun effects dont work and I spent ages doing them! I'll need to get it finished quick."

So am taking this as a sign that I shouldnt go today so am just gonna stay home, couldnt be bothered going today anyway and ive got no money to even get the bus so am not exactly complaining. Might clean the whole house today cause it is so bad, ill put Enterprise on the TV while am watching it, might take my mind of things long enough. Bad thing is ive got no food to eat AT ALL! Because ive got no money I cant get anything so I dont know what am gonna do. I'll think of something, anyway better get started."

They wont take too long to dry off though cause its so warm in the kitchen. Graham finishes as soon as I start and david finished at 9 so looks like am gonna be tiding up myself today, so because grahams going then guess whos gonna be the object of the slagging today....what ones will they come up with today...I think theyl properly go with the stupid thing today, seems like the proper day. Aunty T will be in which is good, shes the woman I work with, shes mean and bitchy to everyone but she likes me, think its cause am like her. Lizzie doesnt start until 5 and am really hopin that shes on sweets or something, if she is then she wont be a few feet away from me, but if she sput on the tills then shes out the front which just isnt fun. The heaf chefs going to be in, think he majors in skiving. Leckie and Angry will be in so they always slag off the head chef aswell so I take it it wont be too bad, am hopin.
Got college tomorrow, am hopin to get 2 subjects finished next week, I know am pushin it but i just want college dont and dusted as soon as possible.

Managed to make something to eat for my breakfast, cant say it was good but I needed something. I'll need to egt some things at the garage tomorrow when I come home from college. Had 7 beers lastnight, cant remember the last time I drank so much, maybe it was because of the way I was feeling. Wasnt even tipsy, I hate it, I know people who lose it after 2 never mind 7. Would have gave anything to make lastnight pass quicker. 
I dont know if am gonna be the same tonight as I was lastnight, I looked back over what I wrote and to my surprise I wasnt saying ""wtf was I thinking"". 
Am gonna try and just keep my mouth shut today at work, even if I get slagged and I know I will am just gonna keep my head down and just get on with what am suppose to be doing instead of answering back.

My work has made me an awefull person and if I get any worse I will leave, even if it means not seeing Lizzie anymore, I liked who I was a few year ago and I dont like who I am now."

"event","As I knew I would be to day was shite, work was so crap, for startes Lizzie was on the foodtill outside so I only saw her a few times. Am sick of the place and I really cant be bothered, I was in almost 30 mins and I already wanted to beat the living tar outa the head chef, he kept demanding everying, no botheringn to say please or thanks, he was shouting for things while he was standing there with his finger up his ass. Also had to listen to my pal moan about how he hasnt seen his gf in 3 days and he was all depressed about it, fair enough but he kept going on, hes going out with friends tonight and he was still moaning! I mean cmon! I stare at the ceiling each night hoping for somone to talk to me or just to txt me so I dont know what hes bloody complaining about. I honestly cant remember the last time anyone sent me a txt, I really cant. He doesnt know how lucky he is.
I can hardly make out the keyboard, I wish I was a nicer person, both inside and on the out, maybe then people will like me. On the way home I couldnt help thinking about how sucky this is, I know I moan about this alot but its really important to me to have friends, not just people to talk to when I happen to be a convience, but people who actually like me. I know am not a nice person, outside ive accepted that, but in the inside I now know how much of a dick I am and I really want to change it. Maybe then ill have friends and a gf. I cant believe am talking this much crap, I dont even know were its comming from, ill properly get up tomorrow morning and look at this and go ""wtf am I talking about"", but its fresh in my head and i need to get it out. I just want to be a better person....
Another person knows now that I like Lizzie, someone was wiping her with a towel and she was being serious when she told him to stop it but he kept doing it, he went to swing and I caught the towel, he turned around and I just stared and him and he backed away, think he got the message. But then graham commented on it and someone heard him and that person guessed who it was so now he knows and am really scared that hes gonna let it slip to someone or even her, may not hurt for her to know but I just dont want the head chef to know. I like her so much now I know am gonna miss my chance and ill go into a depressing bastard, even more now than I already am. Just so many things was going through my mind on the way home from my work that I almost swerved into the crach barriers on the motorway comming home.
Ive also had nothing to eat today and its showning I think, feel dizzy the now but am not giving a crap. Theres nothing to eat in here, ive got no bread what so ever and ive got only Pepsi Max and Beer in the fridge and am not gonna have time to go shopping tomorrow cause am working so I wont get anything to eat tomorrow either. Could pass out on the motorway but am really now caring. Wonder how many people would actually come to my funeral if I did, dont think not many, family would come but there obligated to cause there family, even if they hated me which most of them do. Apart from them I cant see many people and its kinda disturbing. Everything just always leads back to me, am a bastard to people that I care about and have very low selfesteam which is why ive not ask lizzie cause I know she can do better than me. Hell anyone can do better than me, am not planning to do anything tonight, might just stare at the ceiling and think about the whole death thing...might do a head count."

Dont really feel to good, I havnt eatin a proper meal in about a week, and the iron thing is kicking back into force, am going to my aunts tomorrow for a proper meal, thank god, been living on microwave meals and crap like that, dont see the point in cooking cause I do that for like 28 hours over the weekend. Looking forward to work, 12 hour shifts arent that bad cause I get to see Lizzie but since last week was good this will be a bad week, it goes in cycles for me so am prepared. 
Got 3D animation tomorrow, didnt know what to do with my Enterprise animation so I went and did a Stargate in an hour lol, which spins and has all the symbols on it. Am gonna try and get the locks to light up tomorrow and hopefully start on the pool effect. Gradit Unit was a pain in the ass today, sat for 2 hours looking at a page of coding for ASP and found a mistake, a bloody space! a space! thats what was causing my website to fuck up, still got a wee bit to go so am confident...kinda.

God Damn shakes!!
On another note ive taken my faceparty off, I just didnt feel right with it. Its caused nothing but trouble, its how I met Kerry and more recently Bonnie (which has kinda died down now), but I also met a few friends on there. Might put it back up sometime..."

I dont feel as bas as I thought I would feel when comming in tonight, but I didnt expect to enjoy work today cause Lizzie was in. Was so good to see her and we did what we usually did all day and I loved it, ma pal had been watching us all day and said to me at the end of the night that was acted like we were going out. SO many times I just wanted to kiss her, we were alone in the fridge looking for salad and there was that pause for like 5 seconds which seemed like forever, had a great chance then but I blew it. She insulted ma pal by saying she liked me alot more and he went in a huff haha, but he took it in his stride. She left before me so I didnt get a chance to do anything but am ok with it, I enjoy myself when shes there. I know ma pal is so trying to nail the new girl chef, its so funny watching him lol.
Was really busy today aswell, legs are killing me but ive got 3 days to do some college work and have some time to myself which am looking forward to. Should get new games and stuff in soon to keep me amused. Got the predator game and some other crap thing that I thought I should waste my money on lol.

But am ok the now and not in a bad mood like I was lastnight...

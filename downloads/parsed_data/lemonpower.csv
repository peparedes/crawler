And in true me fashion, I'll throw in my opinion:

Vince Carter - Half God, Half the Season."

"event","One particular Christmas a long time ago, Santa was getting ready for his annual trip... but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones, so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then, Mrs. Claus told him that her Mom was coming to visit. This stressed Santa even more.

Then when he went to harness the Reindeer, he found three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More stress.

Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground, and scattered the toys. So, frustrated, Santa went back into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey.

When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had hid the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from.

Just then, the doorbell rang and Santa cussed his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas Tree. The angel said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you, Isn't it just a lovely tree? Where would you like me to stick it?""

Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas Tree!!!"

"event","A Greek and Italian were sitting down one day debating who had the
superior culture.

The Greek says, ""We have the Parthenon""
The Italian says, ""We have the Coliseum""
The Greek says, ""We had great Mathematicians""
The Italian says, ""We had the Roman Empire""

and so on and so on and then the Greek says:
""We invented sex""

The Italian says:
""That is true, but it was the Italians who introduced it to women"""

"event","I am looking for a web host with (preferably) a domain. Or anyone with
an ftp they might be willing to give me access to. Graffiti, how're you
doing? I've decided to take a crapload of digital photographs of me, my
friends, my family, my pet turtle, my toy turtle, beautiful women, and
Mikael. Mikael's art... I mean't to say ""Mikael's art"". <br>
<br>
I am now beginning my hunt for host. There is a free hosting company
thats called DotEasy which would grant free hosting up to 100mb with a
one time registeration fee of somewhere between 15-30$ US. I'd go for
it, but then I still would kind of require a domain. Hence forth, I am
starting a campaign to raise money to buy a domain. (Supposedly,
www.hanchu.ca is untaken) So, unfortunately as a result, my actual money
handed into fashion show for pledges will now be unable to correspond
with the numerical amount summed on its accompanying form. (I swear,
Beckoonja, that money went to a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">different </span>charity... one that helps out hungry and needy teens... )<br>
<br>
All seriousness aside, I am quite honestly looking for a domain and a host
for my pictures. Geocities just doesn't cut it... plus, I think it's
geared more towards Scarborough people.<br>"

"event","Oh man, a frickin livejournal. I've wanted one of these things for a while now, but I never liked shopping. So I was filtering through my email when I saw Olga's from months ago saying that she had a LJ up. (LJ totally sounds wrong, i think we should call it LiJo. H'okay, done, LiJo it is.) So I read the novel, and then I read Nolan's, Gill's, and Paula's much shorter novels. And I thought, heck, this'll be one good place to waste time and write stupid jokes on.

H'okay, so let's begin. You gotta see this. Ams claims it to be 'me humour'.

"event","Okay so i never update but its okay cause im sure no one really cares. but anyway i have a story for whoever reads about my cousin, amy.

It alllll started about 9 years ago...

I was at my grandmas for Thanksgiving din din. When my uncle alan arrives with a girl i had never seen before. He introduced her to everyone and i found at that she was his daughter. Me being only 6 i didnt understand why she has never been around before, but then again i didnt really care. She was amazing. She was athletic, pretty, and had the best personality of anyone i had ever met. I fell in love with her. She didnt live in beckley so i rarely got to spend much time with her. When we met she 18 and a senior in high school. After she graduated she went to college and i seen her even less then, but we stayed in touch. Sometimes she would spend the weekend with our family and her and i would go outside and play basketball, and just have fun (or atleast i did, i was probably annoying to her at the time). 
One summer she came in for the entire summer. which was probably the greatest thing that had ever happened to me. I had a blast that summer, but ofcourse it was only the summer and in the middle of august she had to go back up and start school again. Slowly we started to talk less and less, but not because of me, i tried to contact her every chance i got. but after a while she completely quit calling me, quit emailing me, and quit coming to see me. I was only like 9 so i was devastated because she was my best friend. 
About 3 yrs after the last time i had talked to her, she just shows up out of nowhere because one of her dads friends has passed. Anyway as upset as i had been with her for not staying in touch with me, i was so excited because i knew we would keep in touch this time. She stayed for about 3 days and then left. And the same thing happened again. 
Another 2 yrs went by and i hadnt talked to her at all. I didnt even try. I missed her, but i had grown up quite a bit and it didnt bother me near as much. I kind of understood.  
About a  month ago i was bored and started thinking about her and decided to type her email into the search bar on myspace. Sure enough there she was. Only one problem. she hadnt logged in since may, but i thought what the heck? it couldnt hurt to try. so i sent her a msg and about 2 wks later she msgs me back. apologizing for everything, and whatnot. its pretty nice talking to her, and cathcing up and all. Its just kinda hard getting over how bad she hurt me then. But im trying to forgive and forget and hope it doesnt happen again.

anyway, thats my story"

softball tryouts started yesterday. hmm.not as many ppl trying out as i thought. but there are some good ones and some.. well not so good ones. most of the 9th graders i know from little league and i know how they play. coaches umm well. coach durrette.. i like him. maybe cause he never says anything. heh. jack well i had him as a coach in allstars and i think he is a good coach.. he knows the game and he pushes you. the only thing is im almost positive that he doesnt like me because i quit his team. yea i shouldnt have. but i mean .. oh well. and this one chick.. i dont even know her name! shes my least favorite. shes short and a know it all.. i mean yea she is the coach but she talks to me like im a baby. ugh oh well. if i make the team i will just have to put up with it.. and im sure it will get better.
not to mention im so sore from it i donno if i can get out of this chair. seriously. ive never been so sore. heh.

i had plans to take my drivers test yesterday. and my form isnt in yet. im so mad about it. i asked the lady and she was like ""it should be in by the end of the week"" ugh.

found out today that tom. we(the band) gets to get out of the end of 2nd block and the beginning of 3rd block, to go to the band room for some concert thing i think. yea so thats cool.
had sax lessons today with deskins. yea i told him how i did jazz band.. and he was rly happy. heh. even though it was impossible to not make it.. he was still happy. plus i was a good girl and learned eveyrthing that he had givin me last week and could play it.. so that made him even happier.
christmas concert this saturday.. it sucks.. because i havnt the slightest bit of the music memorized. heh. oh well i guess. concert coming up too.. awesome. :)

"event","so yea its been a while cause ive been grounded. not much has went on rly. besides school and band. so friday was homecoming the band went to the parade and marched then came back to the school and went to the game. it was all fun i guess. then last night was the marhcing competition. well.. we did average.  we got a couple trophies. im not taking the time to explain them. if u want to know just ask me.

anyway the main reason im posting is because.... So yea ...there are 31 freshman and 26 upperclassman. Minkeun... i love u dearly.. but matt harris will always be matt harris. he will never be good. he will never grow up.. so just put up with him. dont be mean to him. he has feeling ya know. and u really hurt them last night. and its not just u minkeun.. there are other freshman rumors. 
it doesnt make since to me. i mean us freshman cant help it. we have only been marching what? 2 months? i mean it makes me so mad.. us freshman have been there since day one too. and we have worked just as hard or harder then the upperclassman. sometimes i wonder why im still there. it fun but why does everyone have to be so rude sometimes?

on a lighter note. i got all my new furniture yesterday.. it looks really good. im happy with it.

Friday was the game in Greenbrier east. It went good. I played really good in the show... and marched well also thank u very much minkeun. ;)....  their band had a flag guy or flaggot however u want to put it.. woowwww that was not a pretty site. on the bus ride home from there the funniest thing happened.. this girl named anne kelly ( if u dont know her... well.. shes one wierd kid) newayy ... margaret was sitting beside me and she was asleep i glanced over at anne and she was like freaking out about something.. i didnt kno what was wrong with her.. but she was rubbing her face and crying and rocking back and forth and stuff... so i wake marmgaret up and tell her to look over at her... so me and margaret are sitting there laughing our heads off when she says sumthin like ""this is all mr baileys fault for making me drink so much water""   so we figured she had to pee rly bad... lol...  then when we get back to woody she dashes off the bus to the potty. haha.. it was great

After school three days a week i have band... band seems to take up all of my life... glad i have friends and stuff in there or i would die.
tom we have a game... it should be good. for some reason we dont get to do our halftime show.. capital does tho. oh well i guess :(.

Im talking to my sis on the ocmputer. and she says that she is coming home tmrw. and shes gonna be here in time for my game.. hopefull :/ i havent seen her in 2 weeks. so im excited about that.. :)

And that hurts to think about. but i try not to cry around her cause i know she feels the same way and i dont want her to be sad.

Calm and down-to-earth, you're the foundation of every successful team. You always get your job done, but people quite often forget you're even there. You're taken for granted, but that's how you like it: the spotlight isn't the place for you. You prefer to stick to your job, which you always do well: never with any flash or flair, and you'll never tell anyone about what you did, but you'll always get it done. You're the Tim Duncan or Ben Wallace of your group: always there, always reliable and often forgotten.<BR><BR>

"event","Yes, i too wonder why the frozen coke machine so often breaks in 7/11. But oddly enough, i worry more about where the hell my other sock is.

And on the rare occasion, whether or not i should indicate when driving, especially when exiting roundabouts. 

Onto other exciting news-
- i passed my trials! WOO!
- Frangelico still tastes good
- my cat has a knot in its fur
- Corollary is my word of the day
- Pate tastes like crap
- shitting dick nipples is what happens when you listen to slipnot
- There isn't grease on my tv, unlike rosie's
- And my new bumper logo is planned to be ""CONTAIN YOUR METHANE"".

In other monotonous news, Rosie is having a paaartayyyy. Hopefully this one i wont be drunk and poking her boobs in. *correction- we wont be poking each others boobs until that shrimpy asian creepy guy noticed. Yes, we are pathetic. Well thank god no one had a camera, at least...

Anywho,

Bye bye internet world...

"event","Oops... it has been AGES since i updated... m'bad :D
I tend to end up reading other peoples lj's than writing my own. It is probably because i got myspace and blog crap in there instead.
For those that are vaguely/fleetingly interested/couldn't give a fuck, my myspace account is under the display name mushroomsrbad too.
So, knock yourself out! or not...either way ;-)"

"event","Had an excursion today. TO A MANGROVE SWAMP?!?! How they even call that an excursion i do not know... it was gross. i had mangrove mush up to my knees trying to do some stupid ecology transect thing that i had DONE BEFORE! I did extension biology in year 9, but they cancelled it, so now im doing hte normal biology course for year 11 (the same one) but i have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN! What ever evil person on the board of studies plotten this, is serious going to get some flack when i find them. Well. That will never actually happen. But it was fun venting...!

Well anyway. Shit happens. As they say... (who says that? just me? ok then.)

"event","Well i had a boring day. But in reality, whats new?
i had an hsc assesment for chemistry... THAT was fun! It went ok i suppose. i mean, i dont think i failed, as such, but then, i can never REALLY tell! I also had to hand in a chemistry assignment (ON THE SAME DAY!)...evil teacher...
Apart from that it was ok.

I was leaving school this afternoon, and i decided to wait with my friend who didnt want to leave until 3.45 (by which time the prefects have gone) so we could walk through the shops. On our way there, i spontaneously stomped in a huge puddle of water and soaked us both. Then we had a pretend fight with our hats until i realised there were 2 exec. teachers watching us whack each other...at which point we promptly stopped :P

As i left late, i missed my bus (D'OH!) so i had to wait for the next one (30 mins later)... In light of this i thought ""goody, ill just listen to my ipod! no worries"". Then it occured to me that sed ipod was still sitting on my bedside table... ""DOUBLE D'OH!"" Instead i reread (for the gozillienth time) Camus for beginners. Come to think about it, im glad i did miss that bus and forgot my ipod, because i enjoyed reading. 

I shall leave you with this, my mysteriously non-existant reader:
""Life will me more fully lived in so far as it has no meaning"". Im beginning to understand this whole notion of absurdism...."

"event","Hello readers of the world. WOw that was lame.
Anyway. Besides my lameness, what has happened today.... well crap all really. i had economics (the most boring subject known to man), maths (a close contender with economics), english, which was ok- we did a cool poem called prelude, by T.S. Elliot.
It goes:
 I

The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six o'clock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.


     II

The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.

With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.


     III

You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters,
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the bed's edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.


     IV

His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six o'clock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
admittedly, it is quite bleak... but i thought it was really well written, i couldnt help but like its startlingly true insight into what our lives sometimes become.

Other than that....well... i spoke to my friend jane about her being sick and everything, and she seemed ok. I think she has lost her hair by now. *counting down 2 months until chemo ends!*

My other class was... Ummm... biology! yeah thats right. We did boring things with probes... although my recollection isnt (surprisingly...) too clear, it seemed boring.

So yeah. Thats it. Thought i would leave you with this:

<img src=""http://img2.photobucket.com/albums/v11/chat-moyen/leunig.jpg"" />

I sat beneath a shady tree, 
And fearing it would fall on me, 
I cut it down (pre-emptively).

I saw a little honey-bee,
And fearing it would poison me,
I murdered it. (pre-emptively)

I sensed a dark futility,
And fearing that it could be me,
I dealt with it. (pre-emptively)

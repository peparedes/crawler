"event","hmmmm this is gonna be a sad and depressing entry..just an update on my life<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">-:</span> ive gained a lot of weight, he's off my buddy list, family ehh, grades ehh...<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">+:</span> </span>my
friends are expanding and hopefully we will be doing new things
soon...i'm happy with my friends, thats a good thing about my life i
think right now...i still have my friends, and even though i want to do
new things, i still have them with me and they still make my life worth
living :) <br>
<br>
wow, really in life im pretty happy but this entry makes it seem different --&nbsp; does that mean something tho?<br>
<br>
also, sam zuckernam took me out, and altho that might seem awkward it was really fun<br>
i also watched like 3hrs of <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">camp</span> videos in the last few days.....i REALLY miss it there ..really really <br>
<br>
AND TOMORROW IS EURO. WOOHOO. <br>
NOT.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>
<br>
There are two sides to every story.<br>
<br>
Boy: I saw her today.<br>
Girl: I saw him today.<br>
<br>
Boy: It seems like it's been forever.<br>
Girl: I wonder if he still cares.<br>
<br>
Boy: She looks better than before.<br>
Girl: I couldn't help but stare at him.<br>
<br>
Boy: I asked her how things were going.<br>
Girl: I asked about his new girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Boy: I'd choose her over any girl I'm with.<br>
Girl: He's probably really happy now.<br>
<br>
Boy: I couldn't look at her without starting to cry.<br>
Girl: He couldn't even look at me.<br>
<br>
Boy: I told her I miss her.<br>
Girl: He doesn't miss me.<br>
<br>
Boy: I meant it.<br>
Girl: He didn't mean it.<br>
<br>
Boy: I love her<br>
Girl: He loves his new girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Boy: I held her for the last time.<br>
Girl: He gave me a friendly hug.<br>
<br>
Boy: Then I went home and cried.<br>
Girl: Then I went home and cried.<br>
<br>
Boy: I lost her.<br>
Girl: I love him.<br>

<br>
umm yes, as someone has recently brought up:<br>
i too am very excited for gymnastics<br>
and the bloodtest today <span style=""font-style: italic;"">was </span>really fun..no reason tho..just cuz....i do love my friends <br>
<ol>
  <li>me dragging car into the lab thru the back door...and just chillin with pil..some grand times <br>
  </li>
  <li>realizing that ""HEY"" there was cookies in the car, where dorf and mer were situated..</li>
  <li>they wouldnt open the door for us, claiming they were locked in..but instead had the cookies for themselves</li>
  <li>finally opened the door...and the alarm went off!</li>
  <li>we finally all get back into the lab and chill out for some time, waiting for my turn to get a blood test</li>
  <li>my mom embarasses me by talking to some random women with 2 sons..she tries to make us give them cookies</li>
  <li>we basically eat all the cookies -- wow</li>
  <li>i ask my mom what is so special about nov. 17 and me and mer
point at dorf, so my mom says ""sarahs bday"" and dorf thought she really
knew...quite funny</li>
  <li>then dorf came into the room with me to get my test..and she
makes me crack up and i get in trouble by the lady who tells me to stay
still...it was very hard --then pil and dorf had a convo:<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> dorf </span>-i dont like the needle;<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> lil</span> - but ur dads a dr ; <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">dorf-</span>that
doesnt mean i have to like it&nbsp; --- such funny business ...the lady
even LAUGHED , and pil thought dorf was actually joking</li>
  <li>whats the point of writing this? <br>
  </li>
  <li>i just like reliving good parts of life <br>
  </li>
  <li>i dont know how to stop this numbering</li>
  <li>oh well<br>

<br>
good morning long islandd
<br>
soooooooooooooooooooo not much to update on ..but i'll give you the run through on my weekend

<br>
a) <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">friday</span>-dana came home on the bus avec moi..we went to evans hot tub for like 2 hrs even tho it is, yes, freezing cold<br>
b) <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">friday <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">nite</span></span> - dana and i went to her place --&gt; spent it together..saw some roslyners..the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - yes, this sparked some problems con mes amis...
and i cant even type about it....but i think its good now....that is, i
hope-- very much<br>
c) <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">saturday</span> - went to
the mall w/ jessie carzipan and fisher ...was there for hours, yet me
and car only bought a pair of pants at abercrombie..oh well<br>
d) <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">saturday <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">nite</span></span> - ready for this one? i babysat..what fun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - i didnt have dinner until 12:15 am cuz my lovely
family forgot about me..so they brought home food with them--gts..but
then i got a lot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; apple pie..that was the
best<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - i also had time to call mer and stuff and see what
was up in wisco..that was good -- its weird not having her around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - how could i have been so stupid?<br>
<br>
now its sunday, and ive basically done all the work i actually plan on doing..<br>
so there isn't much to do...<br>"

woohoo<br>
i think i caught a cold ...perhaps it was standing out in the rain for 20 min?<br>
no complaining tho...i guess i deserved it for being a bitch to the mother<br>
what goes around comes around..yea?<br>
or to be even MORE cliche'd -- you get what you deserve<br>
<br>

it did me good<br>"

"event","okay, i've noticed how many times i've mentioned 'being happy' -- it's
kinda weird..am i obsessed? maybe i am. well i'm gonna find other
synonyms and never use the H-word again: blessed, blest, blissful,
blithe, can't complain, captivated, cheerful,
chipper, chirpy, content, contented, convivial, delighted, ecstatic,
elated, exultant, flying high, gay, glad, gleeful, gratified, hopped
up, intoxicated, jolly, joyful, joyous, jubilant, laughing, light,
lively, looking good, merry, mirthful, overjoyed, peaceful, peppy,
perky, playful, pleasant, pleased, satisfied, sparkling, sunny,
thrilled, tickled, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">tickled pink</span>, up, upbeat<br>
<br>
so, i cheated and went to synonyms.com -- that's what im about, taking the easy way out<br>
not so good?<br>
<br>
well i just wanted to comment on how often the thought of being
""content"" comes up in my mind (that's what this is, isnt it? a
compilation of my thoughts)<br>
<br>
andd i'm super pumped for gymnastics 04-05...i guarantee it will be rad. and exactly what i need to get my body back into shape.<br>
just the word <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">gymnastics</span>
makes me 'ecstatic'...i think it's one of my favorite things to do, and
the gym is one of my favorite places to be...oh the memories<br>
<br>
another quick thought: maybe i don't want to be 'merry' --- afterall,
the happiest (i couldnt help it) of people, are the most ignorant<br>
i don't want to be classified as stupid.<br>
but i can't hold back my 'joy' at times..<br>

at times i get really happy and excited for no apparent reason, but other times im just sad and depressed<br>
i shouldn't complain b/c things aren't that bad..i'll just have to wait, and hopefully life will turn out better<br>
<br>
i'm failing out of school but thats another thing<br>
and i don't really care!<br>
<br>
also, bush. there are no words for that man who ruins our economy, and
cares nothing about the environment. don't even get me started about
social issues OR the ""war on terror""..great policies mr. president.<br>
yea, i'm a liberal..you will be too eventually <br>
i have learned that we are just following in Europe's footsteps, and that they are extremely liberal <br>
so long conservatives.<br>"

"event","i sprained my thumb today in vball..it makes typing a pain? you wouldnt
realize it but i have already corrected 3949696030 errors that i have
made in this single entry..hmm<br>
<br>
so i saw my beautiful camp friends this weekend...i do love them. but i
also do love my friends from home. it's just such a different
relationship and it cant even be described -- ill try tho.. in
camp&nbsp; there is no pressure with schoolwork and grades, although
this summer there was INTENSE competition and sucking up for cw and
r/w/b day and tribes, etc. -- that kinda sucked ..also LGT which we had
to study for..but 1 test within 2 months, i would call amazing.. even
with these factors tho camp was still amazing and just exactly where i
want/wanted to be. i mean i guess its the same for every camp, but i'm
just so happy i ended up at blue ridge cuz i KNOW that my experiences
would have been different (im sure great, but different) ..and i dont
want thm to be like that, cuz everything was just perfect. and ill
never forget these 6 past summers, ever. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1999-2004 ALWAYS. </span><br>
<br>
home, tho..i just dont hve words. sometimes i get SO fed up and
frusturated, but other times i just love everyone and everything..like
right now.. all in all i do love my 7 best friends ...i just sometimes
wish we did other things instead of the same ole..but either way, im
happy ..cuz i know i got the greatest friends, and they are the best
that Roslyn can possibly offer :) (and thats pretty good)<br>
<br>
long update? <br>
<br>
this brings me to another question/statement...do i like him? im kinda leaning towards NO <br>
<br>
uch so my mom is being really annoying and w/ my hand pulsating and being the w ay it is, im just NOT in the mood..<br>

its getting late so i'm gonna make this a fast life update:
what i'm doing now (besides updating) = writing on a white shirt with
black marker for v-ball tomorrow ..much harder than it sounds

my friends = good good...we had a huge fight over the weekend but
everything is settled now & better than ever..i think i even
possibly got closer with everyone as a whole...hmmmmm -- and cara
siskind, WHAT A BITCH :) 

my fam = ick -- yep, i hit pil today cuz she was being so damn
frusturatinggggg ..sometimes i feel she purposefully does things to
piss me off! anyways i got my new camera taken away, so i cant even
take pictures! she also took away my brand new books (which i helped
pay for)...isnt it pathetic that taking away books is a punishment for
me? what a book lover!

social life = blah --- i better be going to some parties this weekend
or else i should just go and drown myself in the pond..i cant sit home
anymore while every other group is out having fun...oh well, we shall
see

i wont even go further into other aspects of my life, cuz they just arent worth discussing. yep, that bad...

oh and PC'S 2004, the girls who epitomize life AND are just the greatest people ever 
anddddd let me just mention PUNTA CANA 03/04...a pic from that vacation is my background..also epitomizes life

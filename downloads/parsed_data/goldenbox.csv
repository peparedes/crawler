"event","First off FUCK HIM. That bastard. He came over and got his stuff tonight. Before he left I sat him down and told him that I was pregnant and I wanted to keep the baby. He tried to talk me into aborting when I told him no I didn't want to that. He started saying how I am not thinking about either of our futures and all I want is to cling to anything to keep us together and how I am trying to get back at him. I just started to cry and my mom who was probably listening in on the whole thing told my dad and he made Alex leave.

How could he say that crap? I broke up with him! I don't want to get back together. I am not trying to get back at him it's effecting me too! Who gets pregnant to get back at someone? That's just stupid. I love this baby and I don't expect him to help. I just wanted to let him know that was all. I knew he wasn't going to take it great or anything, but my god. I never thought that was going to happen.

I am just so upset and now I think I am going to throw up."

"event","My head is killing me! I've been throwing up all day long. I can't believe how suddenly this hit me. To make matters worse I saw Alex the other day. He was with one of his friends. I tried to hide behind some people so he wouldn't see me. But he ended up seeing me anyways. He came over to talk to me and we made small talk. I wasn't sure why he even came over to talk to me since we broke up on bad terms until he told me he left some stuff over at my place. I decided I wasn't going to tell him I was pregnant then I'd tell him when he came over to pick up his stuff. Or i dunno. I'm a big fat chicken at this point. I really don't want to."

"event","I went down to the office and talked to one of the social workers there. She got me the forms and helped me fill them out. She said to send them in and I should hear back in 4 to 8 weeks. She said it's usually less time then that though. She also gave me the address of a clinic to call and make an appointment.

I made the appointment for June 30th. The woman I talked to said it was no problem and told me I wouldn't be seeing the doctor anyways. I'll be seeing the midwife for the first appointment. Not sure why though.

I also told my mom today. It was really hard, but not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. She asked me if I had a plan. I told her no I just found out. She said she'd help me in anyway she could. Right now things seem normal sorta. I'm not sure when I'll tell the father. I really don't even want to talk to him or see him. I'm still so pissed at him for the shit he pulled before we broke up. I dunno. 

I wanted to know what my due date would be so I looked it up online and if I counted from my last period I would be due around february 1st or so. It's so weird thinking by next year i'll have a little baby."

Alright...I miss him a bit. I miss having someone, being able to trust that person fully, the way he was good with kids, the touch of another, the way I could tease him mercilessly and he'd still love me.

But I DON'T miss him checking out every girl (and guy) at all the hollywood parties. And I DON'T miss how he'd fart like an earthquake and not even use air freshner. And I certainly don't miss the way he complained about everything. 

*slaps self* <b> SNAP OUT OF IT WOMAN </b> I guess I miss him a BIT, but really I miss having someone. Don't get me wrong, I'm not about to throw myself at a random guy, hit on a girl (NO EWAN), or go out with Johnny (again, NO EWAN)

""the topic"" is D-o-m. As I mentioned before, we...haven't talked since ""then"", and I've got a few ""anonymous"" people telling me to forget him, he's a jerk.

It was really random, and I may have been slightly tipsy, but I went on about how I missed having him as a friend...really quite embarassing I hope they all promptly forget it.

Yesterday I was moping about my life...I mean, I can't tell this person how I feel because I'm afraid it'll jeapordize our friendship, I'm afraid Milla and Ewan's friendship will shatter because of the whole ""Gale getting beat up""  thing,the fact that all the salespeople talk about my big feet, the way Milla says the ""minions"" all love me but my permanent doubt is still hanging over saying ""what if they dont"" and all the other shite going on in my life is just too overwhelming, so I literally lost in and started crying my miserable eyes out.

I ended up going over to Johnny's and spending the night. Clear all perversions from your mind because this was a traditional girly sleepover. I whined about my problems a bit, he let me paint his nails (honestly johnny you can be SUCH the queer), and we listened to B*witched. Remember them? We also choreographed a dance to ""Cest la Vie"" which involves a bunch of gyrating and gang gestures. We had so much fun and the B*witched song ""Rev it up"" is now our girly little ""friendship song""
Thank you Johnny I love you.

Dom: I seem to take you for granted a bunch, but I want you to know you are one of my best friends, and that I love you tons. I've kept my mouth shut about you-know-what, and it will stay that way. You're my Icy peach, my blues clues buddy, my sunshine. *blinks* That was sappier than I usually get, but I guess reading ""A time for Dancing"" has it's tolls.

<font color=red>
""I use to say she was a skanky whore, which really pissed her off. But, yes. She plays a courtesan. A high-class whore. A high-class skanky whore."" ~Ewan on Nicole Kidman's character in Moulin Rouge 
<font color=white>
""I'd say, 'You're meant to be in love with me! You cannot refer to
me as a skanky old whore!' And he'd go, 'Oh yeah...Sorry."" ~Nicole Kidman on working with Ewan in Moulin Rouge 

""I hated Clueless with a passion. I thought it would have been a really good film if someone had blown her head off at the end with a really huge gun. I mean, this rich bitch suddenly becomes charitable and then she's okay? And then there's the token black friend. It was so corrupt, so L.A., I hated it."" ~Ewan in Teen Magazine, September 

""An airport customs inspector once recognised me from Trainspotting 
and strip searched me looking for drugs.""~Ewan
<font color=red>
""My dad saw my full package in Pillow Book and said, 'I'm glad to see you inherited one of my major attributes.'"" 
 <font color=green>OMFG I laughed SO hard @ this one! 

<font color=white>
""I smoke a lot. I drink far too much-I don't excercise. I torture small animals."" ~Ewan on his sex appeal. 

""Ewan was the clumsiest. Every take, something would fall off his 
costume or he'd drop his lightsaber."" -Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard 
<font color=red>
""Could have been edited by a crack-addicted ferret with 
ADD who just downed a half dozen Pixie Stix.""-review of Moulin Rouge
<font color=white>
""Actually, I really want to play Princess Leia. Stick some big pasteries on my head. Now that would be interesting."" ~on his casting in the 'Star Wars Prequel' 

""People have actually said to me, 'May the Force be with you'. I think that's quite batty."" 
<font color=red>
""I'm just looking for that moment to drop my Jedi knickers and pull out my real light saber."" 
<font color=white>

Well THAT was fun wasn't it kids?  Here's the site if you wanna see them all Ewan: http://www.karenmarshall.com/ewanquotes.htm Actually, I was feeling kinda rotten after the salespeople mocked me, but these actually made me feel better.

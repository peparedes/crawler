"event","Okay what did I doooo... well I watched the Flames move onto round 3! 10,000 people poured onto 17th ave. when the last goal was scored only Calgary can have 10,000 drunk people in one place and have no one get hurt with minimal nudity.


Went to watch Lacross championship... Calgary VS. Buffalo, We won! awsome game real loud nearly a sell out croud... but 10,000 people did not pour onto 17th ave. it was still an awsome game and a great thing to see, Calgary's first lacross championship cup.

Then theres mothers day brunch good food good company and after that spent the day with my mommy =P"

"event","Well..started school...so far it's been...eventful. I got put in Silvestris house. And started something of a riff earlier. See, I unintentionally made this guy, Balthazar Swaggle, angry with Switch because of some things I was saying about him and he overheard. I wasn't speaking very nice things about him, and I sort of let it slip that Switch had told me SOME of those things, but not all of them. Only one or two. I wasn't intending to spread rumors or anything, but I guess that's how he took it. Well, he apparently overheard and got angry with Switch. I guessed he'd heard because he swore quite violently when he saw me get sorted into his house, and this girl Elizabeth I was talking to suggested he had heard and that's why he was mad, and she made me see just how awful I had been to talk about him behind his back like that. So I decided to apologize and entered the house common room just as he and Switch were having a tiff about it (Swaggle seemed VERY angry). So, despite being just a touch nervous of him because he IS rather taller than I am, I marched up to him and apologized. He didn't take my intrusion very well and was quite upset and just kept telling me to leave and threatened to hex me, but I kept at it until I was done with him. It all happened rather fast, I can hardly remember it all, but that's the gist of it I suppose. I'm not sure if my apology was accepted or not, but I think I might have made a small dent in his ego by not being afraid of him as I think he expected me to be. All I can do now is hope he can at least accept the apology and be done with it, he doesn't even have to fully forgive me, just accept that I apologized. But that's up to him. Well, I'm off for now. Ta."

"event","Alright, I now rule out completely the possibility of any of the camp staff being even remotely sane. Remember the jester thing I mentioned? Well now Gareth's decided to go and change the ENTIRE play and now I'm Humpty Dumpty. I'm a bloody EGG! Of all things, he makes me an egg! I seriously think it's the camp counselor's job to humiliate us as much as possible before school lets in. Poor Switch still has to wear sparkly tights, but it's gotten worse for him too. He has to kiss someone. He doesn't seem very pleased with the idea, and neither does Miss Mena. At least I don't have to kiss anyone...Oh no, I have to DIE!! Well, I like eggs. Perhaps I'll just eat myself and end the humiliation before it starts. See you later."

"event","Well, nothing much happened today..I decided to fly solo for the most part so I wouldn't annoy Switch, he seemed a little touchy so I didn't want to bother him....I gave him something I made for him in the Arts and Crafts cabin today....a red stone I've had since I was 7 or 8 attached to a woven neck chain that I made from some colored strings. I was trying to think of something to give him, you know as kind of a friendship token, and I thought of the stone and remembered his favorite color is red so I figured I'd attatch it to something and give it to him...I really hope he liked it...he said he wasn't in a very friendly mood just then and perhaps he'd appreciate it more later...I really hope that was true. He really is the only person so far that I can count as anything remotely close to a friend...anyway, moving on. I got talked into playing the jester in this pantomime that hte camp is putting on. Really I don't understand why it's being called a pantomime when we're all singing and dancing and talking and pantomimes are supposed to be silent, but I'll play along. I have to wear pink with a RIDICULOUS hat with LARGE bells on it and jump around telling horribly bad jokes and hit people with a stick that has bells on it. I feel sorry for Switch, he has to take fencing lessons and be a Prince. He has to wear sparkly purple tights. Poor guy. I suppose though it IS better than wearing pink. Well I suppose that's it for now, ta ta until next time!"

"event","Well first entry...I just started summer camp for St.Dymphna's Academy of Magic. So far it's going well, nothing big going on, although the uniforms are terrible. I haven't made many friends yet, I THINK I made one, but I'm not so sure. His name is Paracelsus Switch, though I just call him Switch. He seems nice enough once you get past the the semi-rough exterior, and sometimes he seems to like me but other times it's as though he just wants me to go away. I suppose that's my fault for following him so much, but I don't know what else to do. Nobody seems to really want to talk to me, even him, but he's spoken to me more than anyone else has so I suppose I just unconciously attatched myself to him. I think I'm starting to annoy him, though. He seemed very irritated today and I think it was my fault. He was a bit sharp and irritable, and it seemed as though most of it was directed towards me, so I think I may either be annoying him or just creeping him out. I don't know. But he IS the only person close to a friend I have so far, despite my many attempts at conversation with other people, so I guess I can't really do much about naything. he'll just have to deal with me. He's been so kind today as to give me the nickname ""Duck"" or ""Duckling,"" whichever he feels like calling me at the time, because of how I follow him. Maybe he is trying to get me to go away. Well he's got another thing coming because I don't give up easily! He's given me a name and so now he is STUCK with me, whether he likes it or not. He'll just have to adjust to it. Well I just thought of something...perhaps he doesn't actually mean to be quite so irritable or mean to me, maybe that's just the way he plays with people. Maybe he's just the type to play around in a brusque manner. I don't know. Just a thought. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to be persistent if I want to befriend this one, which I do because he seems like he would be a nice person if I could get him to maybe warm up to me a little. And maybe I should stop being somewhat of a duckling. Maybe. Either way about it, though, I will forever be branded with the name Duck or Duckling whether I stop or not but I think I may want to at least cut back a bit. It might help me to win his friendship a little. You never know, it just might. Well I suppose that is all for now, goodbye until next we meet again."

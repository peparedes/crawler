"event","I recently heard from a long lost cousin. She was from part of my family that we had lost contect with after a big fight over money and grand parents estate. This side of the family is a little on the strange side. But they are nice enough and I had missed hearing from them. Apparently the feeling was shared.

She called me from out of the blue. She missed us and I talked with her for a good long while. She told me how she had gotten married and now how she is getting devorce because the man decided he should be a woman. She told me about he son and some of his problems. She told me on how her modeling career is doing well and how she had been in playboy magazine and was going to be on a TV reality show.

I in return told her of my life and stuff since I last saw her in her room about 20 years ago. She said she would give me a head shot of her and explained that she had a lot of plastic surgery done.

So after she hung up I found myself in the odd position of trying to find a picture of my cousin. The only source she sighted was playboy. So here I was looking through playboy website for her pictures... very odd feeling indeed. Nothing sexual just that this was the only source I had... I gave up after a bit since her name was hard to find and I don't really have a good idea how she would look now."

<lj-cut>
1) Filling fell out make three teeth that need work... Health

My teeth are falling appart. I have on 2/3 completed root canal tooth that needs a cap. A second 1/3 completed root canal that needs a filling and a cap. And now a third tooth that seeing the size of the filling that fell out will also need a root canal with a cap. Each of which costs 600 dollars with insurance and each require 3 trips to the dentest. All of this and I would not be surprised if I have cavitities as well. I have no money and pray I can hold out till my tax return.

2) Thinking of going to vocational school to become a medical assisstant... Job

I have been dislikeing my job for a while. The store lab is becoming less and less important and they continue to strip away our ability to help customers. More and more these are being moved to centralized labs and as result our profit has been dropping. I think it is very likely they plan to close Pearle Vision. They are doing the normal ""Everything is fine and these changes are going to be so great"" but I don't think a single one of use accually beleave it. 

So I decided I need to find a new job and I have looked in to vocational schools for training. In about a year to a year and a half I could be trained as a medical assisstant. Taking blood, blood presure, weighting peoplem, paper work, etc. The starting pay is similar to what I earn now and the job isn't likely to disappear as my current job is. Also I love biology and I am great with my hands. I am really thinking this could work. I just need to get some money and or dept cleared away before I dive in to this.

3) My work place (Pearle Vision which also own Lens Crafters etc) ordered all Holiday decorations removed.. Job

Pearle Vision has always decorated for the holiday season. They put out a christmas tree and garland and wreaths and such... This has been the case for over 20 plus years and not a single complant. In fact this year we had no complant. We put them up as normal and it lightens out spirits and puts us in a good mood. But this year Bill our area manager told the store managers on a confrance call to have all the decorations removed. Those are the facts and not a single employee or customer is happy about it.

Now perhaps Bill isn't to blame but because he is blocking for those who are or is himself responceable he deserves the full brunt of the anger and venting. Now those who did this refused to put their names on paper or on a memo and refused to put the order on paper. Now there are two possabilities when it comes to this...

a) They are anti christian and anti jewish biggots who don't have the balls to openly make the biggoted rulings. OR..
b) They are spineless executive who were threatened by the mofia (ACLU) or a similar group and as a result they caved instead of standing for the legal rights they clearly have.

As a private company they have the right to celebrate what they care to. They are allowed pick what groups they will and will not support. The whole ""if I allow one I must do all"" arguement is pure bullshit!!

4) Kitten is using Christmas Tree as a play set and knocking down all the ornamates.. Home

We put up our decorations and the CHRISTMAS Tree and the new kitten ""Kasy"" has decided it is her private playground and attack base. As a play ground she plays with the ornaments and garland and some with the light. Slowly a circle of falling ornaments is appearing around the base of the tree. Since it is a artificial tree it is solid enough for her to climb almost to the top, thusly no ornament is safe.

Beyond that she uses the CHRISTMAS tree as a base to launch attack on the other two older cats. They don't want to fight her so they, more often then not, run away. So sould you see a ornament in my tree with two golden eyes and a little mouth, then you may be a target.

5) Got snow... too little snow... need new tires for snow... Home

We got some snow on monday night but not enough to have any effect on any thing other then my van. My two front tires are going bald and need to be changed. As a result even a little snow made my van slip a couple of times and on the steep hill at my parents it slide while in park about 4 feet. And now they are telling me that there will be snow on thursday. Thankfully I am off the weekend from friday to monday. Although this may endanger the sunday night game and the saturday night employee created Christmas celebration at work."

""Musical breast implants 

Computer chips that store music could soon be built into a woman's breast implants.

One boob could hold an MP3 player and the other the person's whole music collection.

BT futurology, who have developed the idea, say it could be available within 15 years.

BT Laboratories' analyst Ian Pearson said flexible plastic electronics would sit inside the breast. A signal would be relayed to headphones, while the device would be controlled by Bluetooth using a panel on the wrist.

According to The Sun he said: ""It is now very hard for me to thing of breast implants as just decorative. If a woman has something implanted permanently, it might as well do something useful.""

My Thoughts: Wow... what can one say but MUSICAL BOOBIES, MUSICAL BOOBIES... man I knew liked breasts but wow now they could play music... I wonder if they will have twist dial control?

Just say something that would be my first pict for my wifes Boobie music collection..

"event","Long time since I posted in this forum.

Lets see what has happened... Work is fine although most are just going through the motions. Synger and I are doing great and enjoying riding our bikes. Gem is been exposed to more old time ""saturday"" cartoons I just to watch as a child or young man... this time it she has gone from the ""Thunder Cats"" to the ""Galaxy Rangers"". As for myself still involved in politics, and I had a interesting thing happen at the church in which I responded to a political issue a visiting pastor brought up. People came to me after church ended to agree with me on the matters.. It was great.

I have been adding to my collect of religious holy texts. The Confucius ""The  Analects"" and the Rastafarian ""The Kebra Nagast"", along with another book which I have ordered but it has not come in yet. Money has been tight but that is normal near years end. Gem has been going to a gym class and having a ball. I think that is about it. Oh I am recovering from the flu and I have also closed the pool down for the season.

This has been your update... best wishes and have a nice day."

I have concluded as long as you feel lucky to be married to you wife and your wife feels lucky to be married to you then your marriage is in great shape. It is when you feel you can do better or that your wife is lucky to be married to you that your marriage may be in trouble.

Also heard a great line in a country song..

"event","I have been tranfering family pictures from VHS to DVD. The current one is family pictures from my grand father. Now I want to give you an idea how time changes people. I remember my grand father as a kind yet stern skinny old man and my grand mother as a sweet sickly bent old woman. But in the films they are young. My grand mother is a attractive well built young lady. My grand father is a muscular impressive young man, I mean he was ripped. Not only that but he served in both the navy and the army and trained to shoot almost any kind of firearm you could consider. He also had a temper, till he found God as a older man, which my mother often resorted to hiding from. What I like about home movies..

You see the person when they were young and you see them only in the happiest of times.
You get to know you grand parents in a light that otherwise is impossable.

I know one thing... I would have never picked a fight with my grand father when he was a young man.. he was truely impressive."

"event","My wife, my daughter, and myself have just returned from an over night trip to Wytheville Virginia. First thing we learned is that Virginia is very long from northeastern corner to the furthest southwestern part of Virginia. It took about 6 hours driving one way. That a side we got there and found many many hotels but only one with an in door pool. Since it was raining and Gem wanted to swim we had to find an indoor pool. With that set we went out looking for dinner. The German Dinner Theater was closed that night so we went driving. In town we found a wonderful restaurant called the Log House. The food was great and the atmosphere and the help was wonderful. Home made foods and some totally new foods that were fantastic. After dinner we went swimming at the hotel and so many kids were in the pool Gem had a fantastic time. All the other people were amazed at how well Gem was swimming.

The next day we got some pictures of the city of Wytheville and batteries for the camera. Then we were off to Virginia City mining and old west town. Now it was a pure entertainment type place. Not a real mine but the sleuth was real and the semi precious stones that you looked used and looked for were real. As was the gold flakes you could look for. We went through3 buckets of sand (mixed with gems) and one small tin of sand mixed with flakes of gold. Gem could have done it for hours. Then we walked to the western town and looked in to the shop there and looked at the homes and buildings up there. It was more beat up then we expected but they have been rebuilding the site for about 5 years now. The owner has a lot of old buildings with different conditions. My wife was disappointed that there were no signs explaining what each building was. I had to put he in jail for that. Then my child spoke up in her defense and in to jail she went to. But we got hungry so I let them out early for good behavior.  We headed home in high spirit though the wonderful mountain scenes. A beautiful place to visit and would be a wonderful place to live. All the people were so friendly and the town was of good size."

Kit sat down with me and discussed his problems and I told him next time talk with me and don't go storming out, in the end we agreed to forget that yesterday happened.

Gem came back late last night and she was very a sleep. But we so wanted to spend time with her that we gentle woke her up and when awake she was he old happy self again. She talked about her trip a little but mostly about Adam and he new monkey ""blue hunk monk""."

"event","This last week things at work just got strange. I have two workers in my lab at work and we collectively know things are changing fast. Of the three of us I have good enough English to feel comfortable working with customers, as comfortable as I could ever be. So with the pending packing of our surface side, stress is high in lab. Anyway one of my staff Dora went on vacation and when the day came for her to return she called in sick. Sick not for one day but for the rest of the week.

Not one day later I am talking with Kit and all seems fine. We have a back up on final inspection and I told him that we need to keep up with final inspection. As this point he snapped and ranted about the work he was doing and then stormed out. It is the first I have ever heard of his discomfort with the amount of work we were asking of him. But he seemed to have no interest in discussing the troubles.

SO, in a matter of just a few days I may become the only lab tech in our store.  This may or may not be the case. Dora may very well be sick and not seeking another job. Kit may return and talk with me about what exactly is bothering him, since I do want to keep him on and am willing to discuss the solutions. I think part of the problem is neither of them really wants to work on the retail floor but that has become part of the job description. I am sorry if they leave, I like them both."

"event","Since Gem is away with Grand parents my wife and I have been going nuts seeing all the films we wanted. Think about the latest releases and we most likely have seen it. We also had a great dinner out and otherwise have been just enjoying each other.

Been thinking about the game and trying to develop the personalities of the NPC team members. 

Also have been moving books from up stairs to the basement in which I have finished building a bookcase along the wall. We do have a lot of books on Christianity. Also adding in my collection of other religions of the world and our collection is vast indeed. I have not read the Christian books as much as my wife has, so she is far better at telling me the differences between the Christian groups, history, and such. My collection of texts and such of the other worlds faiths gives me a good general understanding of these faiths and I have become a source of information for people at work on the matter.

During the moving of books I considered what is the attraction of Mystic faiths. Being Dogmatic myself I have never really connected with purely or mostly mystic faiths. I think some of the attraction is the self-focus of it or more to the point the lack of need to reference a religious text. It is easier for some one to sit and mediate or perform a ritual done many times over then it is to read religious books and then think on the many meaning brought forward in them. 

I have noticed that even in the Mystic faiths people end up seeking books or writings on the faith in question. But that seems to come after a period of self-practice.

But all this is subjective judgments, so I will leave it at that."

"event","Gem is going to Canada with her grand parents this weekend. Sadly this weekend I have to work but  my wife and I are looking forward to a date night. We seldom see movies now, and eating out is always limited by Gem's food wishes. She is very stuborn on what food she will or will not eat. Don't know where she gets that :). 

The ear is still hurting even after 2+ days of the ear drops. I don't get it. Maybe monday I will go back. 

We watched the Kynsey report... interesting and what a nut. Although the study was needed, he just went over the deep end in his lift and as a result hurt many of his followers. He also sounded like as big a fanatic as his father was.

I should be going to work now. So good day."

"event","Tired and Hurting
It has been a long week.

Major changes at work. We have been putting in place plains on what to do depending on what happens with my job. I have had 2 other job offers in the last two weeks and I suspect it would be easy to find a new job should it come to that. It is the time of the season to keep my eyes open and resumes ready.

Had a ear infection that has been lasting over a week now, I intend to see a doctor about it tomarrow. It made the week end somewhat difficulty. Been surviving off handfulls of pain killers.

We had a good planing game in my League White Wolf game. The mission was given to the team, enter N. Korea and destroy their nuclear programs and Biological programs, and get out. Reasources were given them and the details of the mission was to be left to them to decide. The leader of the group thought out the problems and advantages and with the input of others came to a real work able game plan. Certainly I as the GM have to throw in a few twists and turns but it is fun to see players work out a plan and discuss options. 

It was nice to see my old friends again and we has a lot of fun talking and hanging out. I even go the chance to light off a few small fire works and sparklers. We grilled and the food was great. The swimming pool was looking good but my ear infection kept me out of it. I have always been a fan of coal cooking, the smokey factors and such bring so much more to the taste of the food. I have never understood how some one could cook with propane. The food cooked that way tastes like that cooked inside on the stove. Whats the point of that. If I want food cooked on a stove I would cook food on the stove. Some say it's faster, but what is the point of grilling? Speed... I don't think so. It is about talking, hanging out, and cooking good tasteing food. If I wanted something fast I would use a microwave."

"event","I believe there are 5 basic truths about God one needs to know.

1) God is all-powerful and eternal. If God wasn't then were does the other powers come from and why should you follow such a God.
2) God is consistent and flawless. If God changes then we would never know the real nature of God and could never follow God, since God has not made it easy for us to get the updates that such changes would require done.
3) All things can only exist with God presence. Simply put all things are created by God and cannot exist with out God.
4) God is interested in each of us as individuals. All things of this world end including societies. God is not so much concerned with the things of this world but the choices of the heart we make. As such how could God focus on a culture or society over the individuals that make it up?
5) God is a Loving and forgiving God. Although it is possible that God could be a violent or evil God. There would be no reason to follow any such God. If you did you may suffer as greatly as those that don't. The ONLY God worth following is one that is interested in the betterment of our souls.

Does God intervene? How could God not intervene? Yes it will not be in stopping time or changing the world to fit our little needs. It may be as simple as an illness that keeps you from boarding a doomed plane. It could be a stranger saying just the right thing at just the right moment to make you feel God presence in your life. One of the most important parts of our relationship to God is our free will to reject God if we so desire to. Sure God could have made us like the ants working together never questioning why we are here who is behind it all. But God gave us the gift to choose and question. Why? Why is the ability to fail a gift? Because the greatest sign of love is the willing giving of it. God could surely force us to accept him. But what greater love is there then our willing acceptance of our creator. So with this in mind, it would be a sign of an unloving God for God to make his interventions unquestionable signs of God. This is why so many as look at the miracles and say's it was a earth quake, you over slept, it was just chance.

But God know that at time we and others that see us need a hint or a nudge in the right direction."

Is it about you?
Is it about your relationships?

"event","Tired and can't sleep. Packed all I think we would need. Most likely got more then I need. Reviewed the Sikh CD and it is indeed more complete, about 3,000 pages more complete. The Sikh book is a wonderful text that is in many ways like poetry. Many parts are meant to be sung not read. So you get your standard repeats in many part much the same way song repeat. Well the book I had before was a colection of 3 books totaling about 3,000 pages. The book on the CD totaled about 6,000 pages. While I expect I will have some spare time it is unlikely I will have THAT much spare time. Take in to account my learning disability and the fact I hate reading long stuff on a computer screen (which would require me to print the book out... lots of time and paper) you can safely say I haven't read the whole thing yet.

But second only to the Bible it is one of the best holy books I have ever seen. The Quran was very disappointing, The Bahai books too scattered, and the Hindu books too story bookish and symbolic. I know I have not read it all but I think I can make generalized feel for the faith... Honor and follow God, Protect others from oppression, Reach out to others and treat them well. Basic stuff but it is the second part that seems to be unique in their faith. It is also the part that gets them into conflicts, and has pist people of other faiths off.

But I degress point is it I will keep to reading the Tao Te Ching and a number of other downloaded and printed material of much smaller scale instead of the CD. 

Back to the first point can't seem to sleep. Nervious pre trip stuff."

One of my interests is the Sikhs and as such I have been reading an English translation of the Sir Dasam Granth Sahib (translated by Dr. Surindar Singh Kohli). Well almost 8 months ago I was a work (I work as a Lab Manger in a Pearle Vision Eye Glass store) and a customer came in to have some glasses done. He wore the traditional Sikh turban, which I recognized due to my visits to one of their Gurudwara. I spoke to him and I happen to have the book with me so I showed it to him and asked, ""I am trying to learn about your faith, this is the book I have gotten. Is it a good resource?"" He said yes but it wasn't the best resource. So he offered to get me a better book. I gave him my personal information and I offered to pay him should the resource cost him money. He said there would be no charge. Well I waited and waited and many months passed. I guessed he had forgotten or could find the resource he mentioned. But yesterday out of the blue he showed up with a Computer CD in hand. I had almost forgotten about the whole matter. But, here he was with the resource material in hand and he gave me his phone number should I have any questions. A really nice surprise."

She plans it out makes list and such. Me well I wait for the day before to pack, throw every thing needed or not in to the Van and off I go. Sure I will do stuff that cannot be done the day before, days in advance. But packing has never been a big deal for me.

""ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - A 12-year-old girl who was abducted and beaten by men trying to force her into a marriage was found being guarded by three lions who apparently had chased off her captors, a policeman said Tuesday.""

""She was beaten repeatedly before she was found June 9 by police and relatives on the outskirts of Bita Genet, Wondimu said. She had been guarded by the lions for about half a day, he said.""

""Ethiopia's lions, famous for their large black manes, are the country's national symbol and adorn statues and the local currency. Despite a recent crackdown, Hunters also kill the animals for their skins, which can fetch $1,000. Williams estimates that only 1,000 Ethiopian lions remain in the wild.""

It's a cool story of the strange... We all know lions are predators and there is no natural reason for one to protect a human. We also know that male lions seldomwork together. So what does one have to say about 3 adult male lions, all with a rare mane color, would come to the rescue of a young girl? This is most clearly, if indeed true, a strange occurance."

"event","Sundays game went well Se can stright from FSG where he was manageing the sweets. We had fun with a at sea rescue mission and then with the introductions to the other NPC's in the groups and such.

MY friend Sc had a rough week, a close family friend of his died. It is so said when one passes on to Gid before us. We miss them so and we worry about those whom lives we dependant on them. She left behind a husband. Secondly Sc went to the hospital and discovered he had diabetties. So he is going through changed in diet and other health concerns.

Got strange news from FSG that a friend of a friend has had a sex change operation and now is a girl. I always found this fellow hard to be around in the first place because he was flaky to the extreme. SO I guess it does not surprise me when he decide he wanted to be a she. Strange stuff."

"event","Well...

The very next day the live trap and the peanut butter bird seed gained another capture. This time it was a lady Squirrel. She was also upset at the traping and the transfer but unlike her male counter part the live through the process and I released her in a local park. Where she will have to fight with those local squirrels for a place to live and eat. But on the bright side she is alive. Now I still hear movement up there, don't know if these two had children but the live trap has failed to capture any more. So if there are young up there and they are too small to find there way to the live trap then I guess they will just have to starve to death without mom and dad. My attic is full of fluff insolation, tons of little peaces, so digging for them would be nearly impossable.

Well saved one cute rat like pest... I suppose thats a good deed?"

"event","Well...

I did the live trap thing and almost in a hour got me a large adult male Squirrel. I think there was another one up there so I set the trap up after transfering the male into a metal cage. But something odd happened. The male who was clearly upset during this process suddenly stiffened and slid to the bottom of the cage. I checked and it was still breathing. Maybe it was playing dead, or had gone into shock. But even with covers and things ment to calm the Squirrel he never recover and could be seen breathing and creeping around the cage. I have not check the animal as of late but it think he will not live through the night. So even though I tried to save the animals life I still managed to kill him...

Maybe I will do better next time."

"event","Well sleeping in my house has become a bit of a challenge. You see a family a squirrel moved in to our attic. So all night long you hear them running chewing and playing all around over your head. So my wife said ""put a live trap up there"" but the entry to the attic is too small to easly move a live trap in and out of the attack, meaning should it work there is a good likelyhood of the squirrels in question takeing a bit out of me as I remove them from the attic.

So I looked in to paying someone else to do the work... they said live trap 250.00, each squirrel 67.00, then repair to entry points 200+ dallors. We don't have the money for that stuff. I can fix the problem easly costing less then 50.00. But this fix would require me to kill the squirrels in question.

So should I save my nights sleep and my bank account by killing some squirrels? Or should I risk finical problems and my health by trying to save these squirrels?

I am kinda hedgeing toward the killings."

"event","Been thinking about my Wife and Gem, and myself. I have been blessed beyond all possable measure. Still I find myself flawed, not in the sense of being a bad person mind you but in the little things that become big things. I have a job which in many ways I take for granted. I could work more hours and make more money. I could save more. This would give us a buffer zone of comfort that we don't enjoy now. But, when the day is slow and there is no work to do at work I find myself looking forward to see my Gem and my wife. Since things are slow at work they encourage people to leave early if they wish. I do. More often then I should but I do. I wonder if I am doing right. I wonder the value of time with love ones vs the money and it's security in the bank.

I know money is just a tool. I does not last and is not worth more then the things its used for. But the time spent with your family is valueless. Gem will never be this age again. My wife and I will change as we grow and this moment also will never come again. Their is a value in the present that can not be measured. It is of such wonder..... like a masterfully made crystal ever changeing so strong yet with a wrong move so delicate. I think I am doing well by my wife and child. I pray to the creator that I have done well by God and by my family. 

and in the end I know I have."

""Alan Izhar-Bodner, an Israeli inventor, has developed a way for divers to breathe underwater without cumbersome oxygen tanks. His apparatus makes use of the air that is dissolved in water, just like fish do.""

I am certain there are design flaws to this system, but if this become totally funcational a dream of mine could happen.. staying underwater as long as I like without having to go up for new air tanks. I enjoyed the SCUBA I did when I was younger and even became a guide in dives. But the air tanks were always a problem, limiting both the time and the fun of the dive. Wow have a future."

"event","Today has been pretty lovely.

Woke up around noon, which seems to becoming more and more common when I&nbsp;sleep in my own bed(or at Alex's)&nbsp;I&nbsp;guess at the millstone house too, MEH maybe i've just been so busy that sleep doesn't even choose when it shall occur, it just does, and tries to last as long as possible.&nbsp; So got up, hung with maaaam for a few hours, watched a great movie called Lost in Austen which was AWESOME,&nbsp; all of you guys would love it.

Max and&nbsp; I went to get the mail, then he drove me to the beach and chilled with me for a quick minuet. We smoked a bowl and just talked, I&nbsp;don't spend enough time with Maximilian, I cherish the time we spend together. He left and I walked along the beach, close to the water, just how I&nbsp;like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two people bobbing in the waves with surf boards, I&nbsp;can't really say they were surfing, bobbing honestly fits rather appropriately, goin with the flow. 

I&nbsp;stood at the sands edge, right above where the average wave flows to and held a staring contest with the sky, and just watched it, and let the thoughts chase throughout my mind. I cried for those lost, and those in critical condition. I&nbsp;cried for the families in mourning and wished them a speedy acceptance, I cried for Danaz and her family, I&nbsp;cried for the Keller boys and their parents.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cried for Paul,&nbsp; I was wishing Paul was sitting next to me, maybe even crying himself, I cried for the valued things Paul has lost, &nbsp;I&nbsp;cried for his life, I cried for his pure and utter enjoyment that is so rare, I&nbsp;cried  at the fact that everythings changed, and most of all, I was engulfed by those emotions, I&nbsp;released all those emotions into the marine layer, grounded myself, and detached from it all to return home. 


we're having corrned beef tonight nom nom nom and probably tomorrow too. 

yesssssssssssss





On a lighter note, there are some pretty cahh-ute boys that work at the ranger booth where you drive into the beach. Today I&nbsp;met Nick, who was around my age, had black gauges, probably around a 00 ?&nbsp;idk, last time there was Ryan, who was in his early twenties and more ranger like, hehehe but still sooo caahhutee. haha


I'm lame.

Itunes is updating.

Its christmas eve.

woot?&nbsp;

I'm excited for gifts tomorrow because i didnt ask for anything from my maaam and she gots me stooof, and im looking forward to art supplies&nbsp; from Daddio.&nbsp;



Cody is coming over tomorrow, he would have come over tonight for dinner but the city needed his ambulance driving to save life tonight,&nbsp;Which is a-okay with me. I'll see him tomorrah :] 




I love you all, thank you for being beauties in my life."

A little flower-stalk appears, but instead of blossoming at its tip, it is hollow and bears the little flowers on the inside of its tube. The stem swells, grows soft, and becomes a fig. The fig-tree not only bears fruit without visible blossoms, but begins to form its first crop of figs before the leaves appear.</span><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/tangoxwithxthexbest/fullfigpotential.jpg"" /><br /><br /> </font><span style=""color: rgb(255, 51, 204);""><font face=""Verdana"">The fruit is sweet and nourishing, very full of seeds, and possessing soothing, healing powers.

The olive represents the knowledge of the Universe's goodness and of how to bring forth&nbsp; Her love in good works. The fig represents a knowledge of natural kindness, which not rising to the noble character of the olive, still obediently bears abundant fruits of sweet benevolence.

"event","Chapter Five Notes:
Rasko chose not to meet with Razumikhim after all, which came as some what of a shock. Seeing that Razumikhim was Raskos only friend at the university, one would expect him to be of vaule to Rasko. Our main character gets drink after having some brandy and drunkinly passes out in a field of grass where he has a rather intense dream about a tramatic event witnessed during his childhood. A bunch of the town's peasents beat an old mare(horse) to death with a sense of delight, which brought a sickening feeling to the young child.&nbsp;After&nbsp; he awakened from this terrible nightmare, Rasko decides to walk home through the public market and overhears the pawn lady's daughter say that she will be out tomorrow, Rasko's head is filed with awful ideas of what he could do to the greedy pawn shop lady.

Chapter five predictions:
I fee that Rasko's mental state is cleary shown here as very unstable.&nbsp;He cannot control the amount of alcohol consumed and he has been thinking&nbsp; terrible thoughts about his landlady. Through all the pondering he did about whether to go and see Razmuikhim, deciding not to go came as a slight eyebrow raiser.&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel that he may possibly stick to his word and see his friend within the next few following days. 

Chapter&nbsp;Six notes:
Rasko has been thinking of doing a terrible thing to Alyona Ivanovna, his pawnshop lady. The idea of killing her brings slight joy to Rasko for he has hated that woman since the very day he met the old witch. After overhearing a student conversing with a police officer, Rasko is now assured that it is his destiny to kill Alyona. The student said that her wealth should be distributed amongst the poor, and Rasko liked that thought, for it included himself aswell. After leaving the pub and sleeping most of the day away, he awakens around six and realizes he must proceed with his act of hate before the day is over, for Alyona's daughter was out for the entire day. He works with haste further planning his hateful crime, going down to the caretakers shed to fetch the axe with which he will use to slay this evil parasitic woman. He arrives at her door, raged with hate and ready to take this greedbag down. The door unlocks, and its almost time. 

Chapter Six predictions:
I am almost completely sure that Rasko will go through with this terrible deed and kill the pawnshop lady. Due to his mental state there is no doubt in my mind that he would do anything BUT&nbsp;what he had planned. Somone doesn't just go to someone else's shed(simply meaning taking what is not his) show up at the woman's door and not further proceed with his plan.&nbsp; 

Chapter Seven Notes:
Alyona answers the door and Rasko hands her a fake cigarette case to distract the old woman before he slams the axe into with great force. He repetively brings down the axe until Alyona is&nbsp; dead, bleeding on the floor. Now that she is dead Rasko looks around to take any valuables. &nbsp;He takes the small purse from the dead woman's neck and searches the back room. Finding very little Rasko goes back into the room in which this deed had been done. Not long after he enters the room, Lizaveta, Alyona's daughter came in the room and shrieked in terror at the sight of her slain sister. Rasko takes the axe and in an instant reaction strikes Lizaveta once and down she went. He then notice that the front door had been open and he ran and shut it in an instant. Two men agressively were knocking on the door, though they eventually went away giving Rasko enough time to espcape.

Chapter Seven Predictions:
I see that Rasko is now officially crazy!&nbsp;Before it was merely little habitual things that confirmed a mental issue but now a murdering psycho?&nbsp;Rasko was obviously pushed out of whack when Alyona offered him a small amount of money for the things he has brought her.&nbsp; I am unsure of where the story is going to go from here.

Chapter Eight Notes:
Rasko has just commited this huge, mind twisting, crime and has gotten little sleep throughout the night. When he awakes, Natasha shows up and hands him a summonse&nbsp; by the police for him to come down to the station right away. He suspects that this was not about the murder, being proved right when he is met there by his landlady. She had declared him a debtor and demanded to be paid. While he was there, he over hears some police men talking about the murder of the two sisters. Rasko becomes to feel ill and collapse on the floor.&nbsp; He is now afraid that the police station will for sure suspect him of murder.

Chapter Eight Predictions:
I&nbsp;feel that Rasko has a lot of guilt for killing the two sisters. This is proven when he passes out at the police station.&nbsp;After he recieved the summonse it was obvious that he was positive that this had nothing to do with his hanace crime. This view was quickly changed after listening in on the police men's conversation.

Chapter Nine Notes:
After Rasko returned home and recovered from fainting, he nervously gathered the items stolen from the dead pawnshop lady and goes out to dispose of them. Unsure of what to do with them, the guilt riddened man ends up burrying&nbsp; them under a large rock. He then decides to meet up with his friend Razmuhin liked he said he would. Raz is worrid for his friend for he is very thin and offers him a job in translations which greatly offends Rasko. He leaves very mad and wanders the streets until returning to his house later that evening where he then has&nbsp;&nbsp; weird uneasy dreams about a dispute&nbsp;between the detectives and his landlady. He tells the dream to Natasha when she wakes him&nbsp;with food and she tells him that the brutal scene was all in his head.

Chapter Nine Predictions:
Rasko is obviously becoming delusional, for he believes his dream of the police&nbsp; beating his landlady is real. He cannot stand to have the stolen items any longer, and wanders around the town to find the right place to dispose of them. I personally think throwing them in the river would have been a better idea than burrying them under a rock. 

Chapter Ten Notes:
After disposing of the items and having delusional dreams, Rasko starts to hallucinate and is very ill. He awakes after four days of being unconcious and finds himself surrounded by Raz, Natasha,&nbsp;the Landlady and a stranger. Raz brought him new clothes which only upset Rasko.&nbsp;While unconcious, he was seen by a doctor and a detective had come by.&nbsp; He also somehow recieved 35 roubles.

Chapter Ten Predictions:
I'm not sure what is going to happen.&nbsp;He now has money, in a time of&nbsp;which he would have probably expected to be locked up knocking on deaths door being charged with muder. This chapter also shows how good of a friend Raz is, and that Rasko, though ungrateful for what he has been given, really is lucky to have a friend like him. Raz has kept the landlady calmed, and momentarily quiet about all the money Rasko owes her."

"event","--&gt;Both from my blogger.com account. I'm a traitor. LOL.<br /><br />From Wed Feb. 4th 09<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />Oh my, what am I going to do <span style=""font-weight: bold"">without him?</span> Ugh, I know Pacifica isn't THAT far away, but when you're both jobless, carless, and not sure how to even GET to Pacifica, things look tough. Well, of course HE knows how to get there, and said that he would take me so I could learn. I feel like i'm never going to see him, ever, except for maybe weekends. I'm really nervous, he leaves in march.FUCK! GAH! Why does February have to be so short! I need more time! How did this all come up so soon? March used to be three months away, and now its almost here. Yeah yeah I know this month just started sdklfgjszdlkghodfhg &gt;.&lt; I don't want him to leave. I want to be selfish and steal him away, but I cannot. I'm 18, he thinks we should get a place? It's not that I don't love him, or that I don't want to be with him, but I kind of like having our own places. It gives me somewhere new to go, and definitely lets me get so super excited to see him. I'm worried that if we lived together that we would lose our &quot;spark.&quot; That kisses wouldn't be as special because they're always there and my beckoning call you know? I like my space, and I like my space because it lets me <span style=""font-style: italic"">miss him</span> and sometimes it even hurts a little, but the pain from him being gone is all rewarded when I get to see him smiling at me walking towards him, and feeling those few seconds in time when I know I am the one and only thing on his mind. Me, just me, only me. I need to feel like I am special to him, I like being missed, and not necessarily being told so, but more of shown so. Kiss me extra special when I haven't seen you in a week, hold me extra tight when you know i'm leaving for a few days. Love me unconditionally and believe in me, be with me, <span style=""font-weight: bold"">trust me</span>. Cody has been having a hard time with trusting me. It breaks me heart and actually insults me quite a large amount. Ugh, I don't know, it is hard to hear because I trust him so much, and would never EVER do anything to hurt him. I've always been honest with him, and tell him things that most girlfriends probably wouldn't tell their men, though they're men are itching to know. He asks, I tell. I ask, he tells. It's how we work, through complete honesty. And with that said, hearing that he doesn't trust me, and hasn't for awhile <span style=""font-weight: bold"">HURTS</span>, a lot. <br /><br />We talked a lot on my birthday and I feel that things are going to be okay though. He is so beautiful and handsome to me, he keeps my life exciting.<br /><br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />Today's post:<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />I don't know what to do anymore, I am so tired of being sad. I haven't been doing my school work like how I'm supposed to. I wait until the last minuet like always and dish it out amazingly, but I'm tired of that. I'm tired of lazing around feeling anxious to do something, especially when I have plenty do to.<br /><br /><br /><br />Everytime I talk to Cody he sounds so sad and it breaks my heart. We have been having a lot of problems and I have cried way too much. I hate crying, and I hate feeling like I could breakdown and cry at any point given. I don't want to feel this way. He still doesn't trust me, and that alone breaks my heart. He doesn't believe me when I say I've never cheated, he doesn't believe that I am not going to chase his friends, or that I'm not all up on other guys nuts. He doesn't believe me that I am faithful when I rave, PFFFFFFT. I have basically sacrificed my freedom to dance to be a free soul so I could be with him more. I sold my Yellow Submarine ticket(+DJ Hixxy was headlining! I don't think I had EVER been so excited to see a DJ! Aside from Tiesto at Pop, but Ferry Corset(I can't spell, don't judge me Thea! lol jkjk&lt;3) so I could be with HIM. Hold HIS hand, be held next to HIS body, kiss HIS lips, sleep in HIS arms. I just wanted to be with HIM<br /><strong>period. </strong>I don't want anyone else's attention but HIS. I just wanna be his girl, I want him to be proud to be with me, not worried that I'm going to go break his heart. I do a lot of things that upset them, most if not all subconciously. I guess I look at other guys that same way I look at him, with that same spark in my eyes. I am his, and no one else's. He says he does so much for me, and that I never do anything for him, but I don't feel thats true! I do a lot for him, and I have done a lot more than he has done for me in the past. Tell me if i'm wrong, please, but doesn't only hanging out with his friends count as doing something for him? I never used to pressure him to hang with my friends, I would bug him about coming to The Phoenix with me for a show, or downtown so I could see some of my &quot;friends&quot; (no one downtown is truly a friend, pfft. users.) But for fucks sake!! When I would go downtown or to a show without him fucking creepers are all over my junk! I hate it! I stopped going out without him for that sole purpose! He just doesn't get it. So we started hanging out at our friend Josh and Amanda's place thats kinda close to downtown, and after this weekend I think that may all change. Cody accused me of being all up on Josh's nuts, now mind you, these two wonderful people have been together for three years, though now going through troubled times, three years none the less, thats a long motherfucking time ya'll. We all rolled, and were drinking beer, wine, nothing hard, and he got sick, and I was rubbing his back (not sensually or ANYTHING! He was leaning over the balcony yaking and I was standing to the side running my hand up and down his back) Amanda even came out and was like awh thank you for staying with him, helping him, yadda yadda, and Cody sees all of that in a totally different light!!!! It KILLED ME! He wouldn't even take Amanda's word it seemed. For the rest of the night he moped around, lied to me saying he was fine, I figured it was just his body reacting to the drugs, these were like, opiate based pills, but I knew something was up with him, his words can't fool me when his actions are so strong. I just don't know anymore. I love him, I really do, I'm scared to be in love with him, not only because he's leaving but because I don't <strong>want</strong> to be in love. I'm eighteen years old! I don't want to be in love, especially because I don't think he would even want to be with me forever. Even IF I allowed myself to fully fall in love with him. I just feel that Heartbreak is True-Love's best friend, and if that is so I dont want either right now. I just want him, for who he is, and I want him to love me for who I am, and to trust me goddammit!! Trust me you fool! <br /><br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />Oh god someone please help me. I&nbsp;don't want him to hurt anymore, <strong>I&nbsp;dont want to hurt anymore.</strong>"

Well, of course HE knows how to get there, and said that he would take me so I could learn. I feel like i'm never going to see him, ever, except for maybe weekends. I'm really nervous, he leaves in march.FUCK! GAH! Why does February have to be so short! I need more time! How did this all come up so soon? March used to be three months away, and now its almost here. Yeah yeah I know this month just started sdklfgjszdlkghodfhg &gt;.&lt; I don't want him to leave. I want to be selfish and steal him away, but I cannot. I'm 18, he thinks we should get a place? It's not that I don't love him, or that I don't want to be with him, but I kind of like having our own places. It gives me somewhere new to go, and definitely lets me get so super excited to see him. I'm worried that if we lived together that we would lose our &quot;spark.&quot; That kisses wouldn't be as special because they're always there and my beckoning call you know? I like my space, and I like my space because it lets me <span style=""font-style: italic;"">miss him</span> and sometimes it even hurts a little, but the pain from him being gone is all rewarded when I get to see him smiling at me walking towards him, and feeling those few seconds in time when I know I am the one and only thing on his mind. Me, just me, only me. I need to feel like I am special to him, I like being missed, and not necessarily being told so, but more of shown so. Kiss me extra special when I haven't seen you in a week, hold me extra tight when you know i'm leaving for a few days. Love me unconditionally and believe in me, be with me, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">trust me</span>. Cody has been having a hard time with trusting me. It breaks me heart and actually insults me quite a large amount. Ugh, I don't know, it is hard to hear because I trust him so much, and would never EVER do anything to hurt him. I've always been honest with him, and tell him things that most girlfriends probably wouldn't tell their men, though they're men are itching to know. He asks, I tell. I ask, he tells. It's how we work, through complete honesty. And with that said, hearing that he doesn't trust me, and hasn't for awhile <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HURTS</span>, a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked a lot on my birthday and I feel that things are going to be okay though. He is so beautiful and handsome to me, he keeps my life exciting. Though it tends to get a little sausagefest-y. LOL. But he is trying to come into my world a little bit more, meet and actually hang with more of my friends you know? Get to know what I would do if I wasn't with him. We went down to Marin for my birthday and hung out with Liz, Zoe, Max and Walter. We chilled at Acorns then went on a little hike up Blackstone Canyon and smoked a blunt, and some bowls. It was really beautiful! Cody really enjoyed himself and I was super happy to finally hang with Zoe and Liz again. I really do miss them, and Blackstone was so peaceful. I made a Fairy house!! I like, carefully picked out my rocks, and then I couldn't get them to balance, and I was like awhs. And Liz and I were like whatever, and everyone else was leaving(but Cody cause he waits for meeee :D) and I tried one more time, AND THEY ALL STAYED! lol, I want to go back and take a picture. ^_^ ooh and there was an OWL sitting right there in the tree the whole time. Truly a mysterious bird that looked really filled with peace, it was really healing believe it or not. I just wanted to stay there and hang with it for hours, but it was getting dark and we had to head back. That day was really amazing, and I hope we can have another one like it soon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AWh, I like how that really long paragraph changed in feeling, I really do love him, oh so much. Gah, lovestinks sometimes, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">but the sound of his voice sounds ever so sweet.</span>"

"event","I hate how bothered I am about going to Oregon by myself. 
Its not the extremely long train ride  by myself. I don't care about that. I don't care about  being alone while traveling, I actually prefer my alone time while I travel, though I dont mind a friend or someone there to reassure my arrival in the correct place, seeing that I dont know where I am going as far as what the Oregon train station looks like. 

But I guess that shouldn't matter.   I know that I'll figure it out. I have to. I'm going by myself.



I dont think trains have internet. I dont have a ipod or anything anymore. Maybe i'll blog about my trip, minus the internet. lol. oh mac laptop how you're going to suck on a train. 


When i'm in oregon I think im going to buy a new sketch book. I need clothes too. I dont really WANT to go clothes shopping. I dont know what I want to wear, what will ""look good"" not that looking good should matter, I need to care about SOMETHING don't I? I care about my hair, but don't want to change it. I care about what I wear, but don't want to go shop? I'm unhappy about what i'm wearing, but dont have the drive to go out and change it because I dont know what I want to change about it. I say I dont like my band T-shirts, so what do I wear? I have plain solid colored t-shirts, but I dont feel comfortable wearing JUST solid colors. Maybe I should tie dye stuff. I want to. I have nothing to tie dye but socks. and maybe a few shirts. But would I wear those shirts? I don't know.


I like asking questions, but questions bother people. Why do questions make people uncomfortable? What is so terrible about asking something other than ""How are you?"" or ""whats up/what are you doin?"" Thats all people seem to ask each other. A lot of people don't like others to know what they're doing, why? What are you doing that could possibly make my opinion negative about you-Why to peoples opinions matter? Why is it BAD when you don't have an opinion? What if they lead to <bold>thought provoking questions</bold>.


Emotions are strange. My emotions are very different than a lot of the people I am around, and i've been having a hard time excepting that. I feel different.  Change is hard for me to cope with, I am so ready for change, when will it come. I'm really an impatient person, yet EXTREMELY patient at the same time? I am not just ""patient"" because i'm not like that all the time, but then again I am. How is that? How can I be on the polar opposite sides of that one, single word? 




Hahaha, I just realized something. I never did my essays for english because when I would sit down to write them only questions would flow onto my computer screen, no answers.


Its like there is no answer. They only come when you need them. and they like to come un noticed at first."

i've decided that i'm not ready to really do acid yet[and like see shit, really TRIP]. i want to be settled in my own place. and I knew this all along. Playing in that park was just so amazing, like, we played and played like kids again. I'm so glad cody was there with me. I think that if it was just me bryn and jessica, that bryn and jess would have gone off and i would have just stayed by myself-which would have been fine-but eh. I want to go back to that park, but not just yet. I want that stupid little (its not little, hah) playground to have meaning to it, so i want to only return when its an awesome day. I want to go back to those swings, but with new tights this time. I was wearing my leopard tights and i felt so graceful. the way i was swinging keeping my feet from smacking against the ground, meaning i was in total control of my legs, yet it was so natural. I felt like I was flying. An older man who was with his granddaughter and his family walked by, but this guy strolled, and watched me swing, -chuckle- as weird as that sounds, it was okay. he was an older gentleman who looked hippy like, but above dirty hippy status, his family was a young couple with a small child, they all seemed at peace, and he just watched me swing as he past. lol, he said that he wished i could fly, and just fly away. words of wisedom. I wanted to fly,  I couldn't say anything to him, I couldn't. all i could do was swing, fly, and smile at him. cody watched the whole thing, he saw my beauty, my grace. 


the cool thing was my tights made it so surreal. I like tights like that, if i was just in my brown shorts and bare skin, that would have been creepy. hahhahaha, my legs are so pale white(plus i hadn't shaved either) Im going to buy some new tights today. but it wasn't this wise man made me feel at ease, it makes me wanna cry when i think about it. I want to surround myself with people like that, people who will teach me, i will become wise on my own, but a little guidance from my elders, from those who are already wise, is always an amazing thing. 

I am very appreciative of what I have, I may be a little selfish, but thats okay. Im actually very selfish, but in a different way than many others.

I have money.
I hate money.
I give money.
because I hate it so much.
haha'
So i'm basically giving money to those who need it most
Those who don't have a society acceptable ""home""
FUCK
Those people are the free people of our world.
Our ""homeless""
Shit.
Those people have the whole WORLD as their home, i'm jealous.
But alas,
They are looked down apon because society thinks they failed.
They didn't have enough $$MONEY$$ to be as good as everyone else.
Our money in AMERICA. America. america. has absolutely no value.
It's not backed by glorious gold
Or sparkling silver.
It's backed by nothing.
The word of  our GOVERNMENT.
Ya-haha. Like I said
It's backed by nothing. 



I hate money. I like raping major companies for money-by doing a shitty job at work, but really not doing a shitty job at the same time to make my managers happy. But truly knowing in my head, that i'm not working as hard as they want me to. hahahahha.


I'm so evil.



hah.


All right. ha. Now that I am happy for the day. I am going to paint, then go rave outfit shopping with lexi. then chill at home, Cody(brother) is coming over for dinner. Then i'm going to petaluma to see Cody(Boyfriend) and stay down there for the night.



Haaaaaa. Ew. My brother and my boyfriend have the same name."

This protest is strickly mind induced.  they are rioting for my own sanity. my protesters are saying LET GO. FORGET HIM. HE'S IN IT WITH THAT GIRL FOR THE SEX. LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. Its a bloody mess up there. A brain juice, bloody mess. God i can feel the juice sizzle as things try to resolve themselves, i refuse to let my mind win i will not. the protesters will conqure all they will over see that they get their message through loud and clear as fuck.

"event","I posted this as a private entry in my life journal so I would always remember it right after he sent it to me a long time ago..It was after he sent me a message saying that you thought i was going to leave him for some ranch boy.. 


MESSAGE: 

I didn't mean that message as if you would leave me, i was just voicing the worst case scenario running through my head because all my life has been is the worst case scenario and its just that you are literally the best thing that has ever happened to me, I just love you so much that it would literally almost kill me if something like that happened, note, that doesn't mean suicide, that means probably being in my room for a long time til my dad somehow got me out (probably by means of explosives)... 
I had the thougt of the worst case scenario in my head and keeping it there and not saying anything was eating at me... i dont know if you noticed but i dont let out my feelings much and when i do its in large scales because I hold it in for so damned long that after a while it justs bursts forth and there is nothing i can do to stop it. Holly, I need you, I love you, and I'd do anything for you... and thats not the mushy side of me, thats the truth. Please dont think that by me saying my worries that i think they'll actually happen i just cant allow any of my feelings to be held in, because after sixteen years of life of holding things in... I got tired of it. 
Holly, you have opened my eyes, ears, thoughts, feelings, and most importantly, my heart. I love you with the whole of my newly opened heart and please dont think about that particular worry again. 
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, and i can truthfully say i mean that with every ounce of my being, goodnight, sweet dreams, yadda yadda... I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 




now please tell me if you found that from your boyfriend a long time after it was sent, that it would make you cry too.

She has her friends come up to her and tell her straight up whats going on AND SHE tells them she believes it, and confronts Kenny, and of course he's going to deny it, and SHE BELIEVES HIM. 




If it were you who would you believe.. You FRIENDS, best friend included. Or a boy, who you know nothing about and you KNOW he has a past of cheating with, well..Me. ha. I dont know. What are your thoughts on them..? Anyone? Em? Lindsay? Kelsey? anyone? lol. I dontknow. My love life is stupid

He's weird though, like, we were totally going at it, and Kenny was lying right next to us of the grass, so it was kinda weird, but i was crossfaded hella. that was sat. and friday night i was litterally being handed weed. i loved it.

OH OH OH and nadnandandnanda kelsey and kelly came up, and nikki is an attention whore and and and i think we need to have a dramatic free spring break with lots of weed and alcohol and and ACID! Woo!!!

"event","Through the hail of the gunfire, and the sinking of ships
Through that tyranny and irony, and the abled and crips
Through the vicorious bloodshed, and the dropping of bombs, 
I hear the angels singing their song.

Through the deafening beats, of a soliders bass drum,
And a baby that screams, while sucking his thumb,
Through the silence of elderly, succeeding their death,
I hear the angels, take their last breath.

Through the helpful and hopeless, and the carming and crazed,
Through the bodies that lie unfound for days.
Through some pass and some fail, some live and some die,
I cant yet say, I've heard an angel cry.

Send them to heaven, or send them to hell,
They rose to the occasion, yet all of them fell,
For the people that fought, to g ive us our freedom, 
What the angels have given, Will never leave em.

What the angels had given was courage and pride, and this of all things hasn't yet died
It can live for ages, the rest of our lives,
And will only pass on, once the angels have cried."

I'm got out, and am in the office waiting for Lexi..But I think Mr. Kinney has the stick in so she might not come...So I close to an hour to just sit here and wait..... and browse the internet on my laptop. Thats sort of the only thing I like about MSAT. Wireless internet. Aside from the people, (excluding Tera, she looks like she got into a fight with a bleech packet.. its vile) I really wont miss anything. The academics are shot for the most part. I dont know my grades. I'm still part of the big project which is okay. My group's script doesn't really seem to fit as well with everyone elses like some group's do. Making me feel like it's honestly not gonna work. We dont have a introduction video, which is going to fuck everything up. Theres nothing I can do with the Video except be supportive, I dont know anything about making that kind of stuff. It's really frustrating somedays.


Goodness, i'm really sorry if my school woh's are lksjdgjklsnfjsdghasdgl. crappy.

So I said fuck it, told everyone to not come- and I ended up going to Linas house in Novato with Kenny Max and my Mom..That was okay...I got my midnight kiss though =]

Linas daughter was grounded for throwing a party at the house she was ""house watching""...which just happened to be the neighbors house..hahaha instant catch. oh well..she had friends over, they were all chill..Kenny was being anti-social so he didnt want to hang with us, which is fine. he stayed with dungo and isaac(i hate that kid, such a douche) whatever,

I had my palm read, which was kinda a trip, and my mom read my angel cards (they're like tarrot cards, but uhm..not)




Lexi jordan and I are going to lunch sometime this week..and im going back to Marin to hang out with my friends from school..the only people i've seen this break friend wise, are kenny, and lexi...and itsl ike sighkjshgksjdhtfsdg. dies. well..i ran into Haley and Claire at the mall..but that doesnt really count..

We may not be together like boyfriend/girlfriend, he's my Kenny and I am his Holly..And that is a million steps about the boyfriend girlfriend status. And it means so much to me for him wanted to stay here. I honestly can't sleep at night without him next to me. Its kind of pathetic I guess. But its comforting. My bed may only be twin sized, but its all good. I love the feeling of litterally falling alseep in his arms. and waking up to millions of kisses and being hugged and playfully jumped on. I couldnt wish for anything more. 


I never want this to end. Never. Even though it can emotionally strain some thoughts, he always makes it better by re-assuring me that everything we have is so special and he only shares these things with me. and he only wants to share them with me.

I just hope everything falls into place. I really hope everything is okay."

"event","Lately its been hard for me to put into words, and even write about my feelings, or whats going on in my life. I just wish everything could work out for itself. I dunno what to do really. Back off and wait for them to come to me, or keep with it. I just don't want to be like someone I don't like (I'm not going to name names, most of you know who I'm talking about.)If I back off I'm scared they will just get used to the idea and then never come back, or they could just clear their mind and realize what they want. Or if I keep with it, they will eventually realize what they want...or they could get sick of it and tell me to fuck off. It goes both ways. Acutally I'm feeling quite shitty tonight. Today was alright though, spent most of it in the park with Katie, Mike, and Chris. 

This is one of those times where I just need to stop thinking, because everythings getting all jumbled up and its not making sense."

Rob went to work, and Dan and Fonz waited until I was ready. Then Katie and Mike brought me eggs :) such good people. lol Then John finally picked us up after getting lost, lol...then we went to the mall. It was pretty interesting. Then the next morning I woke up at 7:15 to get ready for lacrosse. BOO. It sucked, I'm not gonna talk about it. Then after lacrosse I got home showered and ate food then tried to sleep. My mom picked me up, then we went to get our hair done. Thhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhen after that I came home and got ready for prom. Then we went to Chris's house for pictures. I hate pictures, haha, but it was fun. We got to the prom early, (he drove) but waited till people got there. He introduced me to a bunch of people but I forgot about 99% of their names 5 seconds after he told them to me. lol...then more pictures...blah blah. There was mo dancing, me making an ass out of myself, haha. But so fun. Louie, RJ, and John Contos was there too which made for a good time. Then I met a lot of people that probably thought I was crazy, but its all good. We ate some, then lot more dancing. After prom we went to Nicki's house, and had some good times there. I lost like 5 games in Foozball until me and Nick became a team and whopped Daltons ass. WOO. Then I came home did some homework ,then fell asleep. Now I gotta do more homework cause my life sucks. haha, not really but oh well. More later. BYEEE"

Nothing is perfect, but I hope that everything that isn't perfect will end up alright, and right now...I have a feeling it will. All the bitterness I have had from the past, is just gone. I should be thanking the people for doing what they did, if it weren't for them, I would never have met anyone that I know now.

I went from not talking at all (in human behavior) to now being the center of attention. Maybe I'm just the lucky one that he decided he was going to ""Call on a lot"" so I ""Better be ready"". Bastard! Thats gonna be interesting to see how I do in that class. I passed all my midterms (except for one..yeah...the only one I ""studied"" for)and I didn't get human behavior back, but if I didn't do well on that, then I must be going crazy considering I knew the answers to everything. My dad said I could visit Justin before he went to boot camp...woot woot! I hope that happenes, I miss him so much. (As well as everyone else from St. Lucia) Anyway, I lost my train of thought. 
Oh wait. Lacrosse. Gonna be hell this year. I'm starting to run with Shannon this weekend hopefully. It shall be interesting. I hatttttttttttttttttttttttttte running. OYYYYYYYYYYY. Which is GREAT cause they already told us they were gonna make us do MORE running then in the past cause we moved up a league or whatever. FUNNESS because they made us do like 5 miles just for WARMUP! Can't imagine how much worse its gonna be. ReALLY dont want to. Anyway, mo tired. going now...byeee."

"event","Yeah well this happy day just turned sour. I hate my mom. I honestly do, and it's not only me. I don't think I know anyone of my friends who even like her in the slightest bit. She's a horrible bitch who thinks she knows what shes doing but all shes doing is making me hate her more. Its so wrong and I know it. When shes next to me I just feel angry. I know it sounds rediculous (I can't spell, and I stopped caring) but you know that story, like Edgar Allen Poe or some shit like that where he gets so angry at that old guy just cause his eye is all discolored. Well when my mom is next to me she always does something stupid like breathe or chew really loud that just gets me angry. God if I had the balls I'd just walk out, but I'd have no where to go. I honestly don't know how people stay home. The first chance I get I'm out. They say you don't appreciate your parents or what you have until its gone, or whatever. Well I CAN'T appreciate anything at the moment because it gets taken over with her nagging or screaming at me. FUCKING I HATE HEEEEEEER WHY CAN'T SHE GO BACK TO ENGLAND. I can't think anymore, I'm going to explode."

I honestly wish I fucking knew, cause at this point I'm just pissing myself off, as well as screwing myself over, and then just making myself even more screwed up then I acutally am. See the funny thing is, I don't even know how I feel. A part of me just wants to laugh about it, a part of me just wants to break down and cry, a part of me wants to take everything, not just recent events, back. I know some of the people that I don't want to read this are, but I don't even care. Last night I was thinking about last year, I don't remember why, I was thinking about this past year, and the years before that, and how they are completely different then every other year. How, even though the past years I still hung out with basically the same people, but I stopped being close to some of them. Now I'm friends with my friends that  I was close with like a couple years ago. Which I wouldn't change for the world cause I'm so close to them.  And don't get me wrong, I love all the people I know now, they're great. I wouldn't take back meeting them for anything. It just sucks seeing the people you care about but having to ignore them. It also sucks seeing some of your best friends, who you're still friends with just be blah cause your not so close anymore. I don't even know where I""m going with this. I know I have it better then a lot of people, and I'm not looking for anyone's sympathy. And eh, fuck this. I'm done with writing for now, it's just gonna go around in circles."

School, we got there late so I didn't really have time to do my homework before. So I did nothing in wood cause he ignored me the whole damn time, so  Igot to finish most of my math in there. Which was good. Math, we didn't have a quiz, so thats an automatic plus...and I didn't fall asleep. ::gives high five:: Then english wasn't too bad, I acutally attempted to start the notes (gotta finish that tomorrow cause its all or nothing). Then lets see...blah blah human behavior...blah blah...I found out that I don't have gym (in health)...so that made my day. 

Work wasn't bad at all acutally. I mean it was pretty damn good. We had a good crew today, so it made work enjoyable. =)    Ah, I love my life. I lost my train of thought, so I'm gonna go...Byeeeeeeeeeee"

"event","You know, I think about it. And I think I'm going to give up on not telling the whole truth, cause then, its just like everyone else...with telling everything, but what really matteres. So, people might get pissed off with what I'm saying. But if you don't like it don't read it. 

So this weekend started off great, it really did. You know, Saturday I called out of work to hang out with everyone, and then slept over Katies. Well I wake up, and get dragged to horseback riding, but really I'm glad I went. I had a great lesson. And I think I'm going to stay with my trainers for the summer, cause they said I could be so great if I just praticed more. Which I kinda believe considering I only go once a week, and I do the same stuff that the people that go every day do. So, I think I'll take off from work for the summer and go there. Plus, I'll have my licence, so it'll be fun. 

Well, later today I talked to Dan. I think he is the funniest kid in the world. I really do, and it just goes to show how different people can be. As in some are just ASS HOLES and some are just damn great. Like everyone I met on Friday, they are all so awesome. Of course its the begining of meeting people...as in whenever I meet someone new, they start off great but end up being ass holes. Hm. Who would have thought. 

Well about the whole thing (I'm sorry for putting this online, but it needs to get out of my head...acually, I'm not sorry) We are finally over. It should have been over the first time this happened. Normally, it would have been. But, I believed you when you said you wouldn't do it again. How stupid can I be? Honestly. Just this past week you've been acting funny. But I decided to give you the benifit of the doubt (cant spell) and because of finals maybe thats why you were busy. Well fuck that. You don't have to lie anymore. You guys can ""be in love"" and fuck everyone else in sight. 

See now that I think about it, the anger is just going away. It's turning into stupidity. (?) Just cause it is just stupidness. 

I think that, I need to try out what my first intention was. TO be alone. 

Its funny how history repetes itself. 

I can't wait for this to go away. 

I cant wait to get away.

Only 5 more days. 

Now I can't turn my emotions into words anymore because they are so mixed right now. 

I'll get over it, I know I will. But That was just a complete waist of my life. 

This is waisting my time. 

What would this reason be?"

Today was acutally a pretty decent day, well it was more then decent...it was actually rrrrreallly good. Today I missed wood cause there was a meeting for stupid college thingy. Man, that guy likes to hear himself talk. Its crazzzy. Then the rest of school was kinda a blurr. After school I hitched a ride with Kelly, then Fonz came over.  We chilled here for a while, Dan called me and I talked to him for a while, then we ended up hitching a ride to the mall from my dad. We got there around 4, and got food, then I had to get people presents. So then I was supposed to hang with Lauren tonight, but I couldn't reach her...and Louie couldn't either, so I just stayed at the mall. It was boring at first cause no one was there. But then around 8 a lot of people started coming, and I made some new friends...=) so I'm a happy camper.. it was pretty much all good times, but I lost my train of thought, so I'm not gonna even bother describing my night cause it was just that good. I'm gonna go though, cause I'm mo tired. Goodnight =)"

I was thinking today, well like 5 mins ago, about myself. I mean, really about me...like, who I am and what kind of a person I am. And I realized that I've changed a lot. I know it sounds retarted or what not, but I can't really explain it. I'm at the point where even though I do  care about most things, the things that just set me off before just don't matter anymore. Like, I'm used to it. Which isn't really a good thing. I have to admit though, I love where I am now. Not that I didn't love it where I was before before, but then like in the middle I was unhappy. It's kinda weird if your not in my head, so just bare with me. I dunno, I guess I'm just trying to find out who I am. I sound like one of those stupid ""find your true selves"" bullshit things. I don't even know where I'm going with this, so I'm just going to stop. My who everything is just fried. I'm gone, goodnight."

You know, I'm crazy tonight. I drank a little...and well I just don't have a feeling. Somethings that I normally wouldn't say, well I just say them. I don't know why, I just don't even fucking care anymore. I'm just sorry for everthing that happened over the past few months, I wish that it could be easy. I'm hurting so badly right now. Physically and mentally. I just need to get away. I feel so fucking ass holeish. I'm so glad I hung with Katie tonight, it was much needed. I dunno, I'm starting to feel again, and it hurts. I'm leaving .This sucks."

I'm a dumbass. lol, today I am proud to say I didn't fall asleep in ANY classes. =) Very very proud of myself. School wasn't too bad, Well, I mean I failed the math test with flying colors (uh, who says that?) and then I realized how behind I am on all the stupid homework cause I've been lazy and not handing it in. And then english sucks cause I don't know what my topic even is and we have stuff due for that on Wednesday. After school was chill though, I was with Alyssa and Deirdre for a little bit and then just came home. Praticed some guitar, talked to people. Pretty relaxing. (yeah...shut it) 
I actually got something for Chanukkah tonight. My dad got me a scroll saw, so I'm a happy camper. =) 
Well that was pretty much it for my day, maybe something more exciting will come along...doubt it, but wishful thinking. Byeee"

"event","Today was acutally pretty decent. Eh, school was school, but after school I went home before work. Got some food, relaxed...then froze my ass off on the walk over, I saw Lauren with Laura and Ang but I don't think they saw me, so I didn't bother yelling across the street to say hi. Then I got to work, I didn't stay on register much, which was the highlight of the night. I got really hyper by the end of the night and was dancing and singing to the damn christmas music. Then I stopped at Laurens to give her something, then my moms house to get stuff, and then here. I just would like to say that it was a good day.  Hopefully I wont be on anymore bad streaks ::knocks on wood:: Going now, more later. =)

Noel, Lauren, Ken, and Kelly left...and I finished getting ready. Rob came over, and we went to the party. Chrisanne was so drunk, acutally everyone was...so funny. Good times. =)

"event","About the whole ""things happen in threes""...well I was wrong. It seems I'm on a path where nothing is good. And just as I think it will turn good, it goes crashing back down. I hate today. I hate everyday. My computer is taken away, and the other computer has a password on it. And if they knew I was using this computer, it would probably be taken away either. It's just funny how my mom doesn't trust me. I don't smoke or anything like that, and she doesn't trust me. And then she takes away the only thing I have to escape. The computer, just cause I can have this. To write. Not to go online, Just give me word. And she fucking takes it away. Thats all she has to take away from me. If she took my cell phone away, she would have no way to reach me. Not my fucking problem. NOT my problem. And to top things off I find out something about some people that I just don't want to be true. I hate this family. I hate everyone. I wish I would just fucking die and come back as something that doesn't have to deal with this drama. Its so fucking pointless. I wish I didn't care. I wish I had the fucking luxury to just not care. And then having my brother is just like having 3 fucking parents. Fuck that. I hate this whole thing. I think I'm going to take a walk. I can't fucking be here anymore. 
I wish I could just trust people. And listen to myself. 

I knew that was gonna happen. I know more then you think I do.

And for anyone who actually reads this. I wont be on the computer for like 2 days. or something like that."

"event","Wednesday was acutally a good day. In the morning Lauren and I woke up early, and had my mom drop us off at Manhattan Bagles...I got food and coffee. School was kinda a blurr...I was so hyper from the coffee that I couldn't sit still. In math (since it was the longest class of the day) I kept staring at the damn clock waiting for it to be over. It was pretty horrible how long it was. English I didn't do my essay so that was really bad of me...I have yet to do it. Anyway, after school was better. I was looking around for John, but couldn't find him, and then anyway I found Katie, Mike, and Kelly...and walked out to meet Rob. We got to the diner and ate which was nice. Everyone walked home after, so I went and hung out with Rob. After an adventure in the park with trying to find a damn bathroom, we ended up going to the mall. Then we went to Garden State Plaza. I got new nose rings. =) Thennn he dropped me off at Dunkin with Fonz and Dan...very interesting. We had a contest, that didn't work out, with ice cubes. It was funny, lets leave it at that...::giggles:: Then Mike picked me up, and dropped Katie and I off at the movies. We talked to Lauren and Chirs for a little bit, then went to see The Incredibles (cute movie). Then we stayed a little after, and were gonna meet up with Fonz again, but ended up just walking around for a bit, then ended up at my house. Mike came over later and we all just chilled in my room. They left around 1...I attempted to sleep, but didn't get to until like 2ish. 

This morning my mom was being a crazy psycho bitch trying to get my brother and I up. It didn't work too well, I slept till like 12 (too early, ha) then got up and stuff. Ate some food, set the table. Then people started coming over. Ugh, everything was decent I guess...I mean food was good, but my family is just so weird. Then I was talking to Kelly, taking a break. And my WC (haha, you know what I'm talking about) comes in my room and looks on my computer. I hope he didn't memorize my sn, cause I realllllllllly don't want to talk to him other then what I have to. ::shivers:: Then somehow got my damn cell phone number and was calling me...(he was downstiars, I was up...ahh he just came in again. Anyway, He just called me again when I was in the same room...to make sure I had him in my damn phonebook. AH!!!!!!!! 

My mom is trying to write a book. I was bad and looked at it. It sucks. Not that I'm a great writer...well, I'm not at all...but its about her life or something, or her ""recent social life"" Gross. Anyway, it sucks. Well, I think everyones gone, so I'm going to attempt to get out of here. I'm about to go crazy...more later."

"event","I've already written today. But I figure this is all I have right now, cause I can't stop thinking. Everything is going through my head so much its making me sick. Physically.

Today started off alright, I got in a fight with my mom as usual but it was in the car so I couldn't do anything but blast my music. So I'm gonna be deaf if thats how I have to get out of talking to her. Horseback riding was good, I had a good lesson...it felt good for the time not thinking about anything but what I was doing. Of course it took me forever to get up this morning. Anyway, I got home at like 1:30, showered then Chris came over. We watched this weird ass movie. I forget what its called...its like something Darkem or something...I dunno...anyway, it was weird. And the scary bunny was scary..Frank. oy..anyway...I fucking keep triping, so I fucking triped over the charger for my fucking computer, and the fucking computer broke. So it doesn't close, and I'm afraid to use it cause I'm afraid its gonna fall apart completely. So I called my dad, and he starts yelling at me saying its my falt and I'm the only fucking person that breaks computers or something. Yeah, right...like I wanted to fucking break my computer. Funny. really, I'm histerical. 
Chris stayed till 9, then I finished some english homework. I have so much shit due this week, but I'm procrastinating. 
What happened last night keeps getting replayed in my head. I feel dirty, and violated. All I want to do is take a shower, but even then it wont get washed out of my head. I can't believe that happened, I really can't. What the fuck is wrong with me. What the fuck....::screams::
I need to sleep so I don't have to think, maybe I'll take something so it wont be hard to sleep..cause at this rate, I'll never be able to. I'm hurting, and it feels horrible."

Today I fell asleep in mostly all my classes, I'm getting really bad at that shit, and I hate school. After school was kinda interesting. I hung out with John for the first time, very nice kid. Tara was there too, so it was interesting. Now I have a letter 'H' in my backpack...hopefully John will take that off my hands tomorrow...lol...yeah....so after that John dropped me off at home, and I just kinda was here. I played the guitar for a little bit, and attempted to watch One Tree Hill, but ended up leaving cause Jon called me...(not to be confused, 2 different people)...anyways...I had a nice talk with Lauren today, and realized how much I fucking hate what happened. It fucking sucks, I hate fighting with people, and I hate everything. FUCK, things were so much better like last year. :-X (don't know waht the fuck that face is but whatever...)
Alright...so In human behavior (one of the classes I didn't fall asleep in today) we looked at our dreams and shit. And so I looked up some of the meanings of the dream I had (for the second time)...mostly all of it was either anger, or sexual shit. Kinda weird considering the dream had nothing to do with that. Oh well...Hopefully art will be good tomorrow, I gotta get that guitar fucking finished so I can sell it, and then do the other ones cause I have 3 just sitting in my room waiting to be painted. 

I've been so tired its not even funny. I think I have something wrong with me. I just need a damn day off....Eh, I'm not in the best of moods cause I just don't know what to do for anything...so I'll complain more later, cause thats all I seem to be doing on this damn thing.

"event","I Am Finally Updating Again...Hmmm What Has Been Going On? Well Today Is Another Snow Day So Here I Am Sitting On My Computer All Day Long Again Since There Nothing Much Else To Do At The Present Moment. Well Lately I've Been Around Had Midterms Which I Did So Damn Bad...Ehhh I Just Give Up. 

This Past Friday I Went To The Mall With Muh Girlie Angela. (The Rebels Were Loose.) We Weren't Able To Find The Track Shorts We Needed For The Hellogoodbye Concert But We Got Our Socks At Journey's. There Was So Many Awsome People At The Mall This Past Friday. Well Yea We Had A Fun Time.

Saturday Sucked Major Ass. I Was Bascially Snow Bound Because There Was Like A Damn Blizzard And My Parents Wouldn't Let Me Leave The Damn House.

Sunday Was Pretty Fun. I Hung Out Wif Muh Cuzin For Like The First Time In So Long (I Am Talking About Months Here) We Went To The Movies But We Ended Up Getting A Ride Over To My Baby's Instead And We All Hung Out (Me, Rob (Muh Baby), Joe, And Steph) Played Some Pool And Chilled Up In The Fort. Funniest Part Of That Day Was Doing My Baby's Hair So He Looked Like A Samari. HeHe.

Monday I Had Alot Of Fun. I Had Boring School Then I Came Home For Like Half Hour Then Off To Work I Went Till 6. After Work I Got Dropped Off At Home And Changed And Muh Baby Came Over. (House To Ourselves For A While)That Is Not Often In Muh House Cuz My Brother And Sis. Basically Why I Like Am Always At His House. But Neways So We Hung Out Cuddled In Muh Bed, Went Outside For A Lil And What not. It Was Fun I Love Him So Damn Much. I Like Seriously Can't Get My Mind Off Him. He Is My Everything. February 7th Is Our 1 Year 7 Month Anniversary. YaY. I Love Ya Babe. And Then Valentines Day Is Coming Up Too. Still Debating What I Should Get Him. Ehhh..We'll See.

Tuesday Was Just Blah I Got All Depressed Over Nothing But That Just Me And It Sucks Cuz Like I Cant Even Get Stupid Thoughts Like Yesterday Outa Muh Head. But Then I Talked To Muh Babez And All And Felt Better.

Today Yup Another Snow Day. Sat Online Till Now Workin On My MySpace Account. I Actually Think The Html Stuff Is Finally Coming Along Except I Don't Think Angela Was Able To See It So I Don't Know If I'm Just Doin It All Wrong Or If Her Computer Is Just Really Messed Up. But She Is Gunna Check It Out Later. That Is Basically Why I Haven't Updated In So Long Cuz I've Been Like Stuck On MySpace...Opps Sry.

"event","Baltimore Trip [Dec 26. 2004- Dec 30.2004] With United States Naval Sea Cadets Barque Eagle Division [ Muh Division Located In Plainville, CT] This Was Honestly The Best Trip Ever And Definatly The Best Trip Wif The Sea Cadets. YaY! So In Baltimore...What Did We Do? You Ask. The Purpose Of The Baltimore Trip Was To Stay On A Coast Guard Ship Yard And Work On The Eagle Which Is The Only Tall Coast Guard Ship Left In Commission. Well This Trip Was More Then I Expected. To Start It Off...Our Barracks. These Barracks Were Wicked Awesome. They Were No Normal White Walls And Metal Rack To Sleep In. These Barracks Had Rugs..TV..Frig..Microwave..Pretty Beds..Our Own Bathroom..2 Sinks [For Both Angela N I]..And A Cute Table Wif 2 Chairs. That Just Started Off A Kick Ass Trip.

Monday We Worked On The Eagle Till 3 PM And That Had Went Well. After 3 PM We Ate Chow Then Went Over To The Rec Center And Did PT And Played Some Basketball. That Night They Put On A Movie For Us But Me And Angela Did Our Hair [She Fixed Muh Bangs So They Go To The Left Side] They Look Awesome Now. She Also Did Muh Makeup And We Went Round Taking Some Emo Pix. We Finally Ended Up Goin To Bed Round 3 PM. I Think That Was The Night Wif The Tranquilizers Haha. 

Tuesday We Worked On The Eagle Again Till 3 PM. Then We Went Back To The Barracks And Took Showers And Get Ready Because They Were Bringing Us All To The Movies To Go See Oceans Twelve Because That Is What Was Voted. [By The Way The Movies Was In The Mall. It Was A Pretty Mall But We Couldn't Go Shopping That Kinda Blew] I Voted For This Movie But After Seeing It In The Theater I Was Like This Sux. To Prove That It Sucked I Slept Through Basically All Of It. Angela Did Also And A Few Other Kids. Tuesday Night After Coming In From The Movie We Were All Round Chillen And Anglea And I Went Over To Visit People In Their Rooms So We Stopped In To See What Cintron Astorino And Mctire Were Up To.  We Were All Talkin And Stuff And It Was Awsome Cuz I Never Really Talked To Them As Much As I Did These Days Like It Was Like We Were Awsome Friends.

Wednesday We Had Gone Out To Washington D.C For The Day. We Left The Base At Around 10 AM To Go To The Metro Station So That We Didn't Have To Drive Into D.C And Not Be Able To Find Our Way Round. So We  Finally Get Into Union Station And Stop To Get Out Tour Bus Tix. We Then All Wait Outside So That We Could Take The Tour Bus/Shuttle Bus Around The City. We Went Around Walking And On The Shuttle Bus. We Saw The White House. WWII Monument. The Wall Of Names. Korean War Memorial. Arlington National Cemetary. Washington Monument. Lincoln Memorial. Capital. And Much More. The Best Part Of The Touring In D.C Was We Completed A Task That We Didn't Think Woulda Happened We Took A Pic Wif These 2 Random Guys. Our Plan Was To Take A Pic Wif Cute People. Ugly Peeps. The Bum. And A Few Others I Don't Member Exactly. And A Really Funny Part Of The D.C Trip Was That On Our Walkie Talkies We Picked Up A Kid Who Was Sittin About 50-100 Feet And When We Finally Realized It Was Him So We Were Like Tellin Him What He Was Wearing And When He Stood Up We Were Like Sit Back Down And Stuff. It Was So Funny And Then We Said That We Were The Secret Service And All The Acutal Secret Service Came In And Started Sayin Something. That Night When We Got Back To The Barracks We Took Our Showers And Then We Went Over To Chill Wif Cintron Astorino Mctire And Whoever Else Popped In. We Chilled Wif Them Playin Monopoly And Talked About Some People In The Cadets [No Names Will Be Said] And Then Later That Night I Went Back To Our Room And Got Muh Hair Gel And We Also Melted Chocolate Kisses And Then We Went And Smeared It All Over Cintron And Astorino. We Also Squirted Them Wif Muh Hair Gel Also. Then Round Like 1:30 AM We Went Into Nolans Room Where Salerno And Scott Were Sleeping And Smeared Hair Gel All Over Them. LoL That Was Funny. Oh Yea And Nolan Had Also Been Acting Up So I Gave Him A Purple Nurple Haha. And The Best Part Of The Night Was I Put Gum On The Side Of Lada's Face And He Picked It Off And Put It On Angela But He Got It In Her Hair So She Got Up And Started Kickin The Shit Outa Him Haha Funniest Part Of The Night. Tryed Pullin An All Nighter That Night But We Only Made It Till 3 AM Then Slept Till 6:30 AM.

Thursday We Packed All Our Belongings Back Into Our Seabags And Cleaned The Barracks Out. We Finally Brought All Our Seabags And Stuff Out To The Cars And Loaded Them Up. We Did A Final Check And We Were Out The Door. While Outside Most Of Us Bought A Few Sodas For The Ride Home Cuz We Weren't Gunna Stop A Million Times Like We Had Done Goin Down. We Left The Barracks And Ran Over To The Eagle One Last Time To Say Thanks And Do Our Goodbyes. Patch Was Back On The Boat So I Got Another Pic Wif Him And We Said Buhbyez And Pound Its And What Not. Then On Our Way Home First We Got Stuck In New Jersey Traffic Due To A Tracker Trailer Crash And Angela And I Really Had To Use The Bathroom [Drank Too Much Soda...Oops] So We Jumped Outa The Car And Went Into The Woods And Just Went Haha [We Had To Pee] AhHa. Then Coming More We Hit NYC Traffic And Also Traffic In Connecticut. We Finally Got Back At 6:00 PM Thursday Night. Rob's Mom Had Picked Me Up From The Reserve Center Cuz I Was Gunna Chill Wif Muh Baby And That Is What I Had Done. We Had Fun That Night Jus Hung Out Chilled In His Room And Also Listened To Breaking Benjamin And Ill Nino CD That Rob Had Gotten For Christmas. [ I Love Muh Baby So Much *Muahz*]

I Was Fine For Thursday And Friday I Think Saturday Was Breaking Benjamin Concert So I Was All Excited I Went Wif Muh Baby. That Was Fun. Sunday I Went Out For A Bit And Then When I Got Home I Couldn't Sit Still Like I Had ADHD Or Something And I Just Wanted To Get Outa The House Really Bad. I Wanted To See Muh Baby. Well I Saw Him Today And I Dunno It Like I Just Wasn't Happy At All I Kept Bitching...But It Was Like Yea Keith, Zak, Brian Are All Back From College For Christmas Break And What Not But He Can See Them Like Whenever Especially Keith They Are Brothers So He'll See Him All Week Cuz Keith Is Back From His Appartment For Christmas Break. So I Was Kinda Upset It Like I Mean I Dunno I Was Like Why Did You Invite Me Over If You Wanna Hang With Them But We Usually Always Hang Together I Mean In The Group Whenever Everyone Is At Home. See What I Mean...What Is Wrong Wif Me? Why Am I Bitching And So Upset. And On Top Of That Supposedly It Was Melissa Who Called Rob's Cell...WTF? Can She Jus Stay Outa Our Fuckin Life Leave My Boyfriend Alone...He Don't Even Like Her. And She Don't Even Know Him Which Pisses Me Off More. It Kinda Wierd Sometimes Like She Called And Rob Like All Trys To Play It Off And Not Say Who Called Him. Sometimes I Wonder If He Is Tryin To Keep Something Away From Me. Ya Know? I'm Just So Confused About Everything Like Sometimes I Wonder Why I Try And Change For The Better For Some People When All They Do Is Use Me Or Fuckin Turn Their Backs And Start Shit Wif Me. Lately I've Become Such A Violent Person I Noticed When I Went To Breaking Benjamin :-/. Ehhh...Whatever I Am So Lost And Confused Don't Know What To Do Or How To Cheer Myself Up. Well I Am Gunna Go Do Some Thinkin. Bye

Muh Baby Say That He Needs To Try And Find Who He Really Is Because Lately He Gave Up Acting Like Everything Was Okay And He Was Normal And He Knows He Isn't. He Also Said ""How Can You Love Someone If You Don't Love Yourself But Worse I Don't Even Know Who I Really Am."" I Love Him So Much And I Was Stupid Yesterday And Said ""Why Don't We Just Be Friends Since I Can't See You Ever."" I've Been Just Upset Lately Because I Mean He Hasn't Been Goin To School So I He Can't Hang Out And Then It Also Hurts Cuz I Wish I Could Do Something So I Can Make Him Better But It Seems Like I Tryed Everything And I Don't Know What Else I Can Do. Rob Said Last Night Though That He Needs To Figure Out His Problems And He Needs To Do It On His Own And I Understand. I Am Gunna Wait Patiently Because I Really Do Love Him Like I've Never Loved Anyone Else Before. One Thing That I'm Pretty Upset Bout Is He Said He Didn't Wanna Go To Homecoming And I Already Have Everything Ready Including The Tickets. It Really Hurts Cuz I Want Him To Be There With Me Cuz I Was Planning On Having Such An Awsome Time...But Maybe I Can Still Talk To Him About It :-/ I Hope. We Had A Good Fight On The Phone :-( But Then I Called Him At 11 To Say Sorry For Everything I Ever Did And We Ended Up Talkin Until 4:30 A.M...And After All It Ended Up Being A Good Convo So That Mad Me Happy...Even Though I Am Really Tired Now But It Was Worth It. Well Im Gunna Go Cuz Talkin Bout All This Is Making Me Depressed Some More.

"event","OMG...Muh Heart Has Really Been Shattered Into A Zillion Pieces. Well On Thursday Night Rob Broke Up Wif Me After 1 Year 3 Months. I Decided It Would Be The Best Thing For Me To Tell Me What I Had Done Wif Chris When I Was Drunk One Time But I Think I Hurt Him Even More. But He Said That He Was Thinkin Of Breakin Up Before That. I Mean I Understand Especially After Chris' Death. He Told Me That He Is To A Point Where He Doesn't Care If He Lives Or Dies And It Hurts Me Cuz I Wanna Try And Help Him So That He Does Care If He Lives Or Dies And Jus In General I Wanna Be Able To Help Him Care Bout Anything. And As It Went Wif Our Relationship I Mean I Will Admit I Fucked Up To Many Times Then I Should've And I Probably Am Saying The Same Thing Now Then I Did Before...Jus Give Me One More Chance I Know I Can Be A Better Person And Show You What Love Really Is...But It's True. Oh Yea And About Me Tryin To Show Him What Love Really Is...He Told Me That He Doesn't Really Know What Love Is. A Lot Of People Say You Can't Find True Love When You Are This Young. But I Know That I Did. Rob Was And Will Be Forever The Love Of Muh Life. He Said To Me ""How Do You Know I Am The One"" And I Said I Just Know I Mean Honestly It Really Hard To Explain But It Jus Like Muh Heart Can Tell That We Were Meant For Each Other. I Mean I Will Give Him Whatever Time He Needs Even If It Is Forever. I Mean He Said That Even If We Do Get Back Together It Won't Be For At Least A Month And I Am Willing To Wait. I Am Just Scared That He Will Either Never Come Back To Me And If He Does He Will Be Doing It Just To Make Me Happy But Really Not Love Me. Cuz He Said That He Only Loved Me When I Was In His Arms And That When He  We Broke Up Before That He Didn't Like Me Crying And All So He Came Back. All This Just Hurts So Bad And All I Can Really Do Now Is Just Wait And See If Things Will Get Better Slowly. He Said We Can Still Hang Out As Friends Right Now And Talk On The Phone Cuz I Mean I Know He Needs Space And That Was Wut He Had Told Me So I Wanna Give It To Him But I Am Just Scared That I Lost Another Close Person Forever Also And It Really Hurts.

On Sunday Afternoon Something That I Didn't Think Would Happen To One Of Muh Friends Ended Up Happening. Chris Was Killed In A Head On Collison Wif Another Vehicle. It's Jus So Hard Because Muh Boyfriend Rob (Would Had Become Really Close To Him In The Past Couple Weeks) Muh Cuz Steph, Melissa, And I Were The Last Onces Who Got To See Him Alive. But Even Worse It So Hard Seeing Your Friend One Day And Realizing There Not Here The Next. Another Really Scary Thing Was On Saturday Night Muh Cuz And I Got Into A Fight I Guess You Can Say And I Couldn't Go Home Cuz Muh Dad Didn't Even Know I Was Gone And I Wasnt Gunna Stay @ Muh Cuz House Cuz I Couldn't Take It So Rob Told Me I Was Goin Home Wif Him And That Night We Went Around The Resevior On The Same Road That His Crashed The Next Day And We Were Flyin On Saturday Night 2.

"event","Last night Brittany and I went babysitting. After the kids went to bed we watched TV. The Yankees were on so we watched that during the commercials of Save the Last Dance. I never knew how addicting watching sports on TV is. I found myself flipping to the game every few minutes to check the score. LOL. Who knew?  






A great song:

You don't run with the crowd
You go your own way
You don't play after dark
You light up my day
Got your own kind of style
That sets you apart
Baby that's why you captured my heart
I know sometimes you feel
Like you don't fit in
And this world doesn't know
What you have within
When I look at you
I see something rare
A rose that can grow anywhere

And there's no one I know that can compare

CHORUS:
What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me

You got something so real
You touched me so deep
See, material things don't matter to me
So come as you are, you got nothing to prove
You won me with all that you do
And I wanna take this chance to say to you

What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful...

You don't know how you touched my life
Oh in so many ways I just can't describe
You taught me what love is supposed to be
it's all the little things that make you beautiful to me"

"event","Yay!!! I'm seventeen!!! I can't tell you how many people asked me if: a) I failed a grade, b) If I have my license, or c) Why I'm not a senior. Brittany gave me a really cute card and Maggie brought me beautiful flowers and a little balloon! First block sucked though, because I was outside in gym and it started raining and they made us stay out there for a few more minutes, so i didn't look so great for the rest of the day, but oh well. During business this senior guy asked me why I was so quiet. I told him it was because I didn't really have an oppinion about whether or not it was wierd that he liked the smell of spray paint or not. (that's what he had been talking about) Then I started telling my group things to do for our little project, and he told me that I should be quiet again, because he didn't like that I was bossy. People are just plain hard to please."

"event","So today I had to give a speech in English about myself and the book I read for summer reading. I get so nervous when I have to get up in front of the class and talk. I was physically shaking and my voice was not steady at all. It was so embarrassing. When I was done rambling, my teacher rose her hand and asked, ""When the girl woke up from the 4 year coma, was she really in a hotel room?"" I was like, ""No did I say that?"" The class was kind of laughing and they were like, ""Yeah, I was confused about that too."" I was just like, ""I meant to say hospital, not hotel room, but she was in a really nice facility, so I guess it was kind of like a hotel."" And then I sat down. Urghh. 

I hate it when people complain about nothing, but I just have to say... I am sick of highschool. If your smart and classy, it's like you don't exist. People use you, step on you, and then forget about you. So that's that."

So today I had to get up at 8:30 so I could go to Don's house and help him out. I am going out with Natalie in a little while. We're taking a class. I'm sort of tired though, but nothing a little bit of caffine can't cure. I am slightly irritated because I have some guy named Harry's phone number on my hand and it won't wash off!!!

We had to carry around a flag with us, in case we needed help. At the beginning of the maze we got to pick our team name. There was already a name on our flag: ""The Ugly Ducklings"" But I decided that we had to change it to something cool. Before I knew it the name ""The Beautiful Ducklings"" popped out of my mouth and was announced into a microphone so it was heard throughout the two mile maze. Clever, huh? Today I cleaned out George's dad's refridgerator. It took me two hours. Tonight I think I might play tennis with Michelle. But right now, I'm very hungry..."

"event","Today Maggie and I went out to lunch at Charlie's. Then we went to visit her Granny at Baywinde. We wheeled her Granny down to see my Great Grandma (Nona). They used to live in the same building, so that's why they're friends. We all hung out for awhile, and this other lady came to hang out too. She lives across the hall and it was so cute, because she had this oxygen thing that stretched across the hall, and when she came in, she was like, ""I can only go this far because this is how far my oxygen cord reaches"". It was so funny. We all had a good time. I was telling my Nona about the fox that I see along Lake Road and she shouted (in her thick Italian accent) ""FOX! THAT'S WILD ANIMAL!"" She ran into her closet and reappeared with a cane and told me to take it. She said that a fox would take one look at the cane and run the other way. Hahaha. After visiting for awhile, Maggie and I went to subway to pick up her check, then back to her house, then to the bank, and then we picked her dog up at the groomer. AFter that it was 4 something, and she had to work at 5, and I didn't know the way back to my house. She found it though. I mean we found it... haha. I don't know what I'm doing tonight, but right now I have to clean my room..."

"event","OK, rug races... season one. Me and Maggie just played the FUNNEST game ever. We cleared out the rugs in the front of my family room and surfed on little rugs. I know we are 16, almost 17, but whatever, it was fun!!! Maggie was off to a great start, but then I flew by her to finish the race, making it 1-0. On the way back, we were neck and neck, but then I took a massive running start... which made me fly through the finish line... and lose my balance...and practically wipeout. Even though one of us had to win and one of us had to lose, we had a great time... no regrets. Season two of rug racing will take place August 8 when Maggie returns from her travels to Lake Placid NY. I just know that rug racing nationals are going to be AMAZING."

"event","Today, I played tennis, and I did really good. After, Maggie came over, and we hung out for a long time. We were attacked by bees at dinner, so basically I was out of my seat, dancing around for most of it. After dinner, Maggie and I took my dog on a walk. We were going to go on the trail near my house, but decided it was too buggy. After the walk, we went to Hank's. On the way, there was this family walking on the road (my road is really narrow) and so we slowed way down and started waving. This young dad started waving back, and then all of a sudden, the stroller he was pushing started rolling down a hill. We couldn't stop laughing at him. (Don't worry, no one got hurt... we're not that sick!). By the time we got home, the ice cream had melted, so we put it in the freezer. We just hung out in my awesome room. Basically, we were laughing the whole entire night, because that's what we do... laugh. All the time. At ourselves. It's a good way to burn calories. Tomorrow we are going to go to Bay Winde to hang out with her Granny and my Nona. Maggie is going away for two weeks, and I don't know what I'll do without her!!!!!!!!!! Well she's still here, so I better go."

I sat by Natalie's grandpa, and we were all fighting about politics. It was fun. But then Natalie's dad said to change the subject so her grandpa turned to me and said, ""SO how's your love life?"" Everyone looked at me and I was just like ummmmmm uhhhhhh ummmmmm. Haha. Oh well."

Then, at 6 this morning, she told me that I had to go stay with my dad, which is fine but annoying, because I have to go today and I have a ton of stuff I have to do this weekend and now I have to pack it all in a suitcase. Urghhhhhh. AND I had one horrible nightmare after another last night. In one of them I had no hair, and apparently that means troubles and sorrow in real life. GREAT!

"event","SO I just got back from the carnival and I had a really fun time!! (Despite seeing all of those people from school who I had hoped I wouldn't have to see until the fall, but oh well!!! just kidding, I liked seeing some people) When we got there we decided to eat, so I got a hotdog. Well, I was trying to put ketchup on it and I was pumping the thing, and all of a sudden the ketchup, like, exploded on me. It was ok though, because it only got on my pants. After we ate, we decided to go on the ferris wheel, which is the scariest ride ever. (for me anyways). I was the only person who screamed, that's for sure. We went on some other rides like the bumper cars, but we were the only three people on it. We played a game where you had to shoot water at a circle and it was a race, but I lost. But me losing made Britany win! So she got a bear. We ran into Michelle's friend from dance and she had a big bear that her boyfriend won her by breaking plates with a baseball. He told us about his great baseball skills, and I told the girl that she was lucky and I wanted a bear, but I think I scared her b/c she doesn't know me. Oh well. For our last ride we couldn't decide what to go on. Michelle wanted to go on the ferris wheel (again). I wanted to go on one of those fast spinning rides that goes upside down, but no one would go on with me! So we went on the tilt-a-whirl instead. All in all it was a fun night!!!

So far, I was ""attacked"" by a siberian husky/german shepard mix dog, I was almost lit on fire making smores, I went swimming in the lake in my front yard (ewww), and I completely embarrassed myself when me and Maggie were on a walk. Yesterday, Maggie came over and we decided to go on a walk. There is this railroad trail for walking by my house that we went on. We were talking and we were saying how scary it would be if all of a sudden we turned around and there was a man behind us. After we said that, we were totally freaked out, so every few minutes we looked behind us to see if anyone was coming. Well, we were walking and Maggie was like Erin, turn around. And I was thinking to myself, whatever, she's just trying to scare me, so I didn't turn around. So she told me to turn around again, and I did, and there was a man running towards us. I got so scared that I screamed and started running the other way, but Maggie yanked me back and was like, Erin he's just a jogger. It was so funny. The guy was like, don't be afraid! I won't hurt you ! I felt so dumb, but it was really really funny. So far this summer I've realized something. I've been really bitchy to some of the people in my family. I can't even help it, I don't know why. I can be really mean."

I was about to hit the ball, but then I was blinded by the sun, so I couldn't hit it, and the ball came and smashed me in the head/face. It was funny and it only hurt a little!! I also played PIG with Monica and Lauren. I'm bad at that too. I used to think I was athletic, but now I'm not so sure. I have only eaten junk for the past two days. Yesterday all I ate was a bowl of pops, a ton of bbq chips, and a frappachino. (I forgot to eat dinner). Today I ate a bowl of pops, a bagel, cookies, chips, cookie cake, a lollipop, and tons of pop.

"event","So I just got back from the movies with Maggie and Amy. We saw A Lot Like Love. It wasn't that good. So anyways... about two minutes into the movie, these little seventh or eighth graders walked in and sat directly behind us. There were two boys and two girls. I guess they were on a double date or something.
It would have been fine if they didn't talk throughout the ENTIRE movie. I mean the WHOLE thing. I am such a bitch when it comes to annoying people in the movie theaters. My philosophy is, is that if you want to talk or make out, then stay at home and rent a movie. Well during the movie Amy sighed like she was annoyed so I turned to her and said loudly, ""Oh so you're annoyed too?"" The stupid little shits didn't get the hint. A little while later I turned and it looked like Amy was sleeping but then she lifted her head up and I said (loudly) ""Oh for a second I thought you were asleep, but then again how could you be since it's so loud in here?"" The idiots still didn't shutup. SO THEN one of the girl's cell phones started ringing (it was the more annoying of the two) and she jumped up to run out of the movie theater to go answer it. While she jumped up her pop spilled all over... ME and AMY. Our shoes were all sticky. When she came back her bf was like you spilled your pop all over and she was like ohhh and she said to us, ""Oh no did I get you guys wet?"" Amy didn't say anything, so I was like, ""Yeah, but if you STOP talking we can call it even."" She was like, ""Bitch."" She called ME a bitch. Her bf was like ohhh... beat her up I want to see  a cat fight. I was like oh great one of theses kids is going to punch me in the back of the head or something but then I was like wait a minute, I have Amy and Maggie with me!!! If these little bitches try to start anything we can crush them. But they left me alone, but the girl gave me a dirty look on the way out. Too bad I don't get offended by ugly whores."

I did the combination and then went to open it, but someone had stuck this huge piece of gum on the opener thingy so I stuck my finger right in it. Who does that? It was so gross, and it took me a little while to figure out how to open my locker without actually using the opener. Hahaha. Yes I did look stupid. When I had figured out my locker and got all my stuff, Maggie came rushing by and was like, ""Erin are you riding the bus?!"" and I was like, yeah. Then she told me to hurry up and walk with her because she had to go fast because her sister was in labor, and her other sister was waiting for her to give her a ride to the hospital!!!! I'm so excited! After school I went to my Dad's and waited for him to come home from work so he could take me to my Mom's. At around 4 something I was beginning to think he might have forgotten I was coming but he finally called and said he'd be home soon. I was still really tired. When he dropped me off at my Mom's, instead of saying goodbye, I said goodnight. Hahaha. I have three tests in a row tomorrow that I have to study for, and I have to type my english essay. Oh joy."

"event","What a monday this has been. I was called down to the vice principals office second block. I couldn't think of what it could be for except not obeying the science sub on friday and talking during the practice chem regents (hey I needed help from my friendly chem neighbors!!) I was like it's crap if that's what this is for. But it was for something else, and I wasn't in trouble.(Of course I wasn't, i'm a GOOD kid!!lol). During health we watched SNL clips. I couldn't stop laughing, and I don't mean lightly laughing, I mean gasping fo air laughing. I want to rent it on DVD or find someone who has it and watch it. SNL is the best. Urghh, I have so much hw to do. I actually have to do it too, b/c it's due, I can't procrastinate anymore. I stayed after for Math B review. Today it was SO SO much fun! Just kidding. According to my Cosmo Girl magazine, last saturday was a lucky day for love for me. That's crap. Nothing happened. STILL WAITING for something exciting. Maybe it means *Around* last saturday. Like within a week. Hahaha."

"event","So today my Dad took me and my sister Laura out to breakfast, we go out every sunday. Usually we go to the Atlantic but today we went somwhere else. When I got home, my Mom took me to Target to get stuff for my sister Sarah's new apartment (she lives near DC) and then we got Starbuck's. (caffine makes me CRAZY!!) We couldn't go back to our house for awhile because there was an open house and I'm not aloud to be there because I'm rude to the people since I don't want to move. My Mom and I went to see the progress on the house we're moving into. It's a nice house on the lake, but I still don't want to move. I'll still go to Schroeder though, don't worry. I take my Dad's address for school. I am going to go take my dog for a walk now and then do my homework.... still waiting for some excitement. LOL."

"event","My parents have a punctuality problem. Yesterday my Dad was an hour late picking me up at school. I stood outside until 3:30. An hour is much longer when you're all alone, and you have to pee. He was really sorry, so I was nice about it, even though I was pretty mad. Today my Mom was 10 minutes late from picking me up at tennis. Normally I wouldn't mind, but today I had to get out of there. I got into a fight with one of the boys in my lesson and I just wanted to go home. The kid is eleven and he's in a varsity lesson, so you would think he's mature. He's not. He's actually really mean to me (and not the little boy being mean to an older girl he has a crush on kind of mean... he's really a brat) I feel bad that I yelled at an eleven year old now, he's just a dumb kid. But he's in MY lesson!! Haha. He kept making rude comments while I was playing, so I yelled at him that tennis is an etiqeutte sport, and if you're not going to have good sportsmanship, then DON'T PLAY!!!!! The coach ran over to our court and was like ""what is the problem here?"" and I was like ""HE is!"" The coach watched the rest of our match. Haha. Me and Michelle won!!!I really feel like a bitch though. I have to usher at the school play tonight and I really don't want to. I was guilted into it by one of the counslers. Hopefully something good will happen soon. I could use some excitement."

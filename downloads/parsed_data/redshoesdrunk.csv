So i stood in the garden and stared into my neighbours'. I tried to pretend that i&nbsp;wasn't scrutinizing. She had 13 flower pots, i counted. Some with flowers- some without. I loved the hibiscus the most though.&nbsp;She had a starfruit tree in her backyard. I don't like it. It attracts many&nbsp;bees. there is a beehive in the tree. Bees fly into my room when its cold in the morning and make annoying zzz&nbsp;noises against the lights. So sometimes i have to get ready for school in the dark. Last night, i saw a dying bee on the floor, and i didn't step on it. Well, it looked like it was dying because it seemed to be struggling. I went around looking for a container to cap it and send it out my house. After 15mins i came back into my room. I forgotten all about the bee. I stepped on something hard. I thought i heard a tiny scream and a small squish. I gasped. I remembered the injured dying struggling bee. I screamed. And screamed. And screamed .. </p>"

there was a lady (who was a sheriff)
and her 2 kids
we take out the kids and the lady gets out too
it took the cops forever to get there 
we had to call them twice
the kids were really cold 
and shooken up
so we had them in the jeep
they eventually calmed down
we finally left when their dad
who is also a cop
showed up
damn i was scared

"event","my mom and i were at sams getting ready to leave, and i was backing out, at the same time some stupid mexican lady backs out (i didnt see her backout) shes a shopping cart thingy, and two parking lots apart from me, and i was almost out already putting my car into drive, then i see this big yukon backing into me, i start honking my horn (at this point it was too late to move anywhere) and she backs into me, we both get out of our cars, and she starts telling me that i saw her, i start yelling at her not to tell me what i saw and didnt see, she asks me for my insurance, and i tell ill show her mine if she shows me hers, she refuses.  so my mom and i get down her license plate and her bin number now we're just waiting for the police report, damn stupid fronchi, pissed me off. nothing really happened to my car, except a huge dent on my right back fender.
im off now

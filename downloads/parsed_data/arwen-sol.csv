"event","So the other night at dinner my aunt suddenly tells me she's found the perfect man for me. These are the ""good points"" she pointed out: 

A) He's chinese
B) He's a dentist (if you knew my family you wouldn't ask...)
C) He can sing
D) He's from India 
<lj-embed id=""1"" />

And he's one of the finalists in <i>Indian Idol 2007</i>. Eye rolls aside I was pretty amazed that this chinese/indian guy was competing and even more surprised that he sings pretty well (this was after checking him out on YouTube). Anyway, there's something you don't see everyday :D Not that I'm considering it or anything, I mean, seriously, for all I know we could be related: How many chinese-dentist families could there be in India?

AAANYWAY! Now I'm watching all my fave bollywood songs on YouTube! Here're some for anybody interested though I warn you... unless you've been exposed to it, it does take some getting used to (for one thing instead of the usual 2-3 minutes of english songs, hindi songs are 4-5 minutes or longer!!) :) Mostly the songs that I love are because the lyrics are goooorgeous! And sadly don't translate as beautifully to english though I'll try and leave a translation which you shall not mock lol 
<lj-cut text=""On to the videos..."">
<b>Tu Jahaan (Where You Are) from ""Salaam-Namaste"" (Hello-Greetings)</b>
Quite a modern story actually. Couple lives together and she gets pregnant, he wants to abort it and she wants to keep it. They break up but have to live together because they put all their savings into their shared house so they avoid each other but then meet at a party of mutual friends. This song is about her longing to have him there as she goes through her pregnancy. i.e. she wishes he would say ""where you are is where I'll be. when it's sunny I'll be your shade. when you're alone, I'll be with you.""
<lj-embed id=""2"" />

<b>Mere Haath Main (In My Hand) from ""Fanaa"" (consumed/destroyed... kinda)</b>
Blind girl x border rebel posing as tour guide. They fall in love but then he fakes his death and leaves. Years later, she has regained her sight and he stumbles across her secluded cabin unexpectedly after a botched mission. He tries to keep away but can't and she realizes who it is. They plan a happy life, but he can't leave the rebellion and eventually she is forced to kill him. Personally, the 2nd half of the movie sucked >_< but the songs were quite good and this one says ""in my hand, put your hand. stay by my side through all our lifetimes. if you are beside me then what else is there? in your love I will be consumed"" 
<lj-embed id=""3"" />

<b>Kehna Hi Kyaa (What to Say?) from ""Bombay"" (Bombay/Mumbai)</b>
A muslim boy x hindu girl love story (or possibly the other way round, I don't remember) i.e. challenging post-partitian prejudices and such. Basically says ""what to say? the person you love is yet a stranger so what do you call him to bring him to you?"" 
<lj-embed id=""4"" />

<b>Surah Hua Madham (The Sun Melts) from ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham"" (Sometimes Happiness Sometimes Sadness)</b>
Basically your rich boy x poor girl love story. They fall in love but theirs is an impossible love. The song is about how love makes everything topsy-turvy i.e. ""the sun melts, the moon burns... I stand and the earth walks beneath me"" My faaaavourite couple of all time! Kajol is too cute!! They were also together in the very very popular movies ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" and ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai""
<lj-embed id=""5"" />

<b>Mere Mehbooba (My Love) from ""Pardes"" (Homeland/India)</b>
Hmm how to classify this... Arjun is an orphan who was taken in by the family that she is engaged to marry into. But her fiancee Rajeep is a city snob and she is the pure innocent village girl, and she falls in love with Arjun who is trying not to love her since that would be betraying Rajeep's family. The song is about his longing to find love, ""someday I will meet you, on that day I will find life. But when will that rain come? My heart is thirsting and alone"" does that make sense in english? lol
<lj-embed id=""6"" />

<b>Ae Dil Dil Ki Duniya Mein (In the World of the Heart) from ""Yaadein"" (Memories)</b>
Another rich boy x poor girl love story, though here they were childhood friends but her father owes his father. So to save her father's honour she pushes him away and pretends she doesn't love him because his family wants him to marry this other rich girl. In the song he's all angsty and ""tell me you love me"" and the song is all ""sometimes love is about compromise. you have to laugh on the outside while you're crying on the inside .etc."" 
<lj-embed id=""7"" />

<b>""I'm in Love"" from ""Neal and Nikki""</b>
Okay you <i>have</i> to watch this one if no other, it's really funny because (also I think parts of it are set in Vancouver) Anyway, it's about Nikki who hires Neal to sing and dance with her on the mountain to make her ex-boyfriend jealous. They're so ridiculous but it's a fun song, with some ""interesting"" english lyrics... The tune in the beginning and that hand slappy+nose touch thing they do in the middle are allusions to another very famous movie starring Nikki's sister Kajol and all fans will know it and squeal... like I did ... 6_6'

1. I've come to realize that my ex...
is PSYCHO and I'm SO GLAD I broke up with him even though at the time it made me sad

2. I am listening to...
the humming of my computer which is noisier than it used to be for some unknown reason

3. I talk...
too often and say stupid things that I later regret and think about too much and wished I hadn't said in the first place!

4. I love...
the people I love

5. My best friend(s)...
rock! (except for Josh who is occasionally very trying!)

6. My first real kiss...
is allllll in my head 

7. I lost my virginity...
when I was... ha! wouldn't you like to know. Just kidding... or am I?! o_0

8. I hate it when people....
criticize me for no apparent reason and it's not even constructive!

9. Love is...
over-rated (haha! so says the single person!)

10. Marriage is...
the triumph of imagination over intelligence :) ~Oscar Wilde

11. Somewhere, someone is...
thinking about killing him/her self

12. I'll always try....
to get out of doing work XD 

13. I have a secret crush on...
nobody right now. I'm crush-less, it's depressing

14. The last time I really cried was because...
I saw this ad for a movie that seemed really sad -_-'

15.My cell phone is...
dented because I've dropped it too often

16. When I woke up this morning...
ha! I said ""Good morning"" to Sarah and Chunni who were watching RENT and then I ate ice cream, but it was more around 6p.m.

17. Before I go to sleep at night...
I read a book. The whole book often so I end up sleeping at 7a.m...

18. Right now I am thinking about...
needing to PEE! >_<

do absolutely nothing... okay I'll read my lj stuff but other than that, nothing

23. Tomorrow I will...

24. I really want...
to be a person who does stuff on time.

25. The person who is most likely to repost this is...
probably sleeping right now since it's 3a.m. and most people who read my journal keep normal waking/sleeping hours

26. The thing I hate most is....
that life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get and with my luck I'd get -- shrimp.

If you're wondering what brought this on. I just saw these pictures. I actually <i>refuse</i> to watch the OVAs no matter how much I love Ruroken (stupid filler non-cannon CRAP!)

"event","Was reading last night and thus didn't get to bed until about 7a.m. this morning. I couldn't say that it was the ""captivating literature"" that kept me up since I (sadly) gave into temptation and picked up a few easy-to-read romance novels. I'm saving all my heavy reading for when school starts up and I have to focus on those thousand word essays again. I think it was just my old summer insomnia come back to haunt me. 

Anyway, reading these types of books always make me think about relationships in general and my interpersonal-relationship skills in particular--- which incidentally is generally lacking. It's so frustrating because I know that these stories just idealize romance, sex and love and at the same time I can't help wanting the ideal, and it doesn't help that everyone around me who is actually in a relationship is telling me to be realistic. Because shouldn't love be beyond all you've ever known and seen and heard? 

Blargh! Did that make sense? or is it that I just haven't had enough sleep? I'll think about this some more and probably edit this post to make more sense, but I guess in a perfect world, actual guys would say these actual words. And in a perfect world, I wouldn't laugh in their faces."

"event","feels so strange. I woke up the first morning back and just lay in bed realizing that today... I wouldn't have to go anywhere. It made me sad, and the silence in the house seemed louder than all the noise of the previous month. I miss everybody TT_____TT I wish I could've stayed longer but I'd decided to come back early to finish cosplays and now... I'm so unmotivated to make anything. But... oh well..."

"event","SO! I (stupidly) decided to cosplay Lenne as a duo with my friend as Songstress Yuna aaaaand I'm having issues. Mainly, that the costume is TINY and I'm ... not. And I dunno, at this stage everything is starting to irritate me so I just wanted to get a general opinion >__< are these ear-hangs too small?!?!?! I know it's not like a HUGE deal because people will know who I am but these are kinda special for Lenne since her and Yuna wear the exact same thing pretty much (and the long hair) and-and-and--- all I need here is some reassurance that I don't look like a complete retard TT___TT

"event","Picked this up from a friends journal <3 You'd think I'd know a lot of movie quotes from working at a video store but that... isn't true -_-' anyway, take a guess. Most of them are really obvious haha I like stupid movies and a bunch of them are animated (not unexpectedly) so GOOD LUCK! 

Rules:
1. pick 25 of your favourite movies.
2. then pick one of your favorite quote/s from each movie.
3. post the quotes in your journal.
4. have those on your friends list try to guess what the movie is.
5. either strike out the quote once it has been correctly identified, or place the guesser's user name directly after the quote.

<lj-cut text=""Ready, Set, Go!"">#1. At last, we can retire and give up this life of crime

#2. 

A: Are you classified as human?

A: Is it dark?

B: Young lady, I am getting just a tad tired of your attitude problem. 

#8. there are two kinds of fat people: there's fat people that were born to be fat, and there's fat people that were once thin but became fat... so when you look at 'em you can sorta see that thin person inside.

#9. 

A: What's his type? Wilting flower? Bright and bubbly? Or smoldering temptress? 
B: I'd say... smoldering temptress. 

#10. What God and greed have joined together, let no love put asunder.

#19.

A: Wings? I don't have wings! 
B: Of course not. You're a boy. 

#20. To feel...it's as vital as breath. And without it, without love, without anger, without sorrow, breath is just a clock ticking.

#21.

A: You're a genius 
B: Yes I shall go down in history as the man who opened a door

#22. Fairness does not govern life and death; if it did, no good man would ever die young.

#23. Are you saying you'll flunk us if we don't change the world?

"event","So I'm waiting on the results of the mascot contest, still no news on when it'll be announced. I'm thinking after March 12 since that's when the staff is having a meeting up at SFU--- Not that I really think I'll win but y'know, hope springs eternal (I say that a lot). My mom says there's nothing wrong with ""healthy competition"" and sure, I uh... believe that... in theory. As long as I win XD haha Here're <a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/view/29890357/"">some of the entries</a> that got pooled together, though not everyone's is there. Check out <a href=""http://MaximK.deviantart.com"">Maxim's</a> and <a href=""http://Squeegeeboi.deviantart.com"">Sara's</a> galleries to see their entries. I really like <a href=""http://kurot.yorisou.net/kurot-crappy.jpg"">Kurot's</a> colouring though the drawing itself is very typical. I dunno... she's the preferred winner right now ^^;

Anyway, onward to the reason I'm writing: I ordered some yaoi manga from Amazon because there's no good yaoi/shonen-ai  around here and Chunni has all the cute ones like <b>Legal Drug</b> and <b>Earthian</b>. So even though I usually don't like buying manga without seeing the art first, I didn't have a choice in this case. I read the reviews though and they were mostly positive so I decided to get: 

<b>Shinobu Kokoro</b> by Temari Matsumoto (mmm.. bishie-ninjas! haha Apparently this one is really explicit but who knows what the editors think is explicit and what is going on in my head +cackles+) 
<b>Desire</b> by Maki Kazumi/Yukine Honami (apparently the art in this one is kinda like <b>FAKE</b> so hopefully I won't be disappointed!)
<b>Wild Rock</b> by Kazusa Takashima (the art looks REALLY good in this one! though what is with the title ^^'?) 

I was thinking of getting <b>Passion</b> by Shinobu Gotoh but it sounds kinda nutty o_0 And then it remined me of something that really irritates me which is, why won't anyone publish <b>Sensei!</b> by Kazune Kawahara. I mean c'mon, compared to <b>Passion</b> which is studentxteacher AND yaoi! <b>Sensei!</b> is like candy and fluff +sniffles+ I luuuuurve Ito sensei so much and if anyone finds me a translation of that series I will lurve you foreva! (haha, how's that for motivation 6_6')

XD no comments on my reading tastes please. Anyhow, now I'm excited. Hopefully I'll get it between this and next month, I'm not a patient person! The last time I ordered something I got it pretty quick. In the meantime I suppose I'll have to keep reading the djs Chunni keeps dloading onto my comp XD haha, not to say I haven't done my fair share of dloading but bt was really starting to get on my nerves and I've prolly forgotten how to use irc, it's been a while.

Mm... looking at all these bishies really REALLY makes me wish I could draw boys/men ): there should be like a tutorial or something (haha) I'd love to draw some cute little flirtatious piece with unnecessary blushing, sweating and flowers/sparkles coming out of nowhere! As with anything I guess it just needs some practice.  

Speaking of, I was looking at my old drawings and I really think my line work needs work. No more skinny even lines, I need to vary the line thickness to make things more interesting. Although the skinny line thing really works for some people +sigh+ But first I must work on my end-of-term papers T__T thinking about it is making me cry. I was like, oh my mid-term papers are over I can do whatever but that time just flew by without me doing anything productive whatsoever. 

So'kay that's not entiiiirely true. I did make some props for cosplays (yaey!) I made the songstress Yuna and Lenne earrings (will post pics eventually) and bought the fabric for the tops and the arm thingies. Also, I bought some corr-plast yesterday, it was like this gigantic piece that I somehow managed to fit into my tiny little toyota tercel! and that's for the Clover cosplay... just buying it made me excited to start working on the props! woo!

In other news, the soundtrack for <i>Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights</i> is surprisngly good. If anyone else has good latin/-jazz/ballroom dancing type music suggestions, do let me know ^^ Also, watch/listen to the music from the movie version of <i>RENT</i>! Seriously, who knew Rosario Dawson could sing o_0 ?! I don't usually like that style of rock-musical but it was very well cast/done .etc. 

Well, I'm going to go now and pretend to be productive for my CMNS class XD

"event","I was just thinking... I wish I could excel at one particular thing than just be mediocre in a number of fields. I mean, I'm a mediocre artist, musician, student ... I can DO a lot of things reasonably well but I don't stand out at any one of them. It's enough to bog me down in depression. 

What brought this on? Well, I just finished my entry for AE's 2006 mascot contest http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/29600773/ and the CGing is so-so. Then looking at my watercolours and chalks and poems and stories and everything is so-so. Don't dub me with false modesty though, I know I'm better at most of these things than the average person would be at one but still >guh!< 

I wish I had the inclination to perfect something to be patient with it, grow with it, let it develop with me but I'm too flighty for that or something... or maybe I'm just scared of disappointing myself. Now that's just going down another rabbit-hole of depressing thought so I'll leave off the subject before I accidentally trip myself up.

Okay so this morning... I woke up crying because of the dream I'd had. Something that hasn't happened to me since I was 8 years old when I dreamt that my grandmother died. It was so bizarre because I dreamt that three of my cousins died and being a dream they were in completely nonsensical ways like a skiing accident (to a 6yr old?) and a poisoned bed (had seeped into the mattress!) 6_6'

So when I woke up for a few seconds I thought it was real and I was crying and then I looked at my clock and I'm like ""okay, it can't be real, it's saturday"" haha maybe I can use this scene as some kind of inspiration for my art XD

"event","You know the old saying, <i>If you love something let it go. If it comes back, it's yours; if it doesn't then it never was</i>?!

Well did you ever think that, <i>If it just sits in your living room, eating your food, messing up your stuff, and using your phone while taking all of your money, and never behaves as if you actually set it free in the first place... you either married it or gave birth to it.</i>

I saw this quote in the book I'm reading (<u>Unleash the Night</u> by SHerrilyn Kenyon) and thought it was simultaneously witty and ironically true. I think it describes the sort of dual way I look at ""love"". A part of me wants to believe this whole <i>true love</i> ideal and the other part, rather than venomously opposed, is apathetic... which is scarier because if you hate the idea then atleast in some way you're acknowledging that it exists. I don't know, maybe apathy is an excuse, a defense mechanism so I don't have to think about why the ""fairy-tale-romance"" isn't coming true for me (books are SO misleading!!) >__<

Blargh! Too much thinking, I blame it on the upcoming Valentine's Day. Which is why, to get my mind off things I'm throwing the First Annual [Singles-Only] <b>""BITE-ME-I'M-FREE-and-LOVING-IT"" ANTI-VALENTINE'S SOIREE</b> so as someone said, I don't have to spend <i>another February 14th, eating icecream and watching reruns and wondering if I'm going to die alone...</i>

"event","I have +just+ discovered 2 chances to win free 3-day passes to AE06 and I'm so excited! The 3-day passes this year are going to be $30 which, while not alot, still takes away from the money I could use to do other stuff i.e. make costumes, make loli items to sell, buy anime/manga from the dealer's room!

So I've already started my sketch for the AE06 mascot contest, and I don't wanna hafta say this myself but I have a rockin' idea. We'll see how well I pull it off! If I do though, I HAAAVE to win because the idea is just +that+ brilliant!! 

The second choice is the Crystal-Mall Cosplay Contest, which is mid-Feb. It unfortunately doesn't give me a lot of time to prepare :o I can't reuse any of my old costumes cuz they're not +that+ great so... something new... but +whatever+ could be so spectacular that I'd win?!

These are the few I'm thinking right now--- depends on my ability to make them within the next few weeks. But they seem like potential winners. I'm soooo exciiiiited!

-- actually she has a lot of cool costumes and I haven't really picked the one I like best yet i.e. pretty and the easiest to make ^^;

haha, okay all the characters I pick have long black hair and are gorgeous, but I can erm... pull it off, yeah... sure XD!! I was thinking of doing Oruha's black costume from ""Clover"" but I dunno--- I'm already cosplaying Oruha at AE so I don't want to repeat a character. OMG and I'm still looking for someone to be Kazuhiko wiff me. +sigh+ I love that couple so much <3 

guh! I guess I should go to class now and stop surfing the net for pretty pictures >__< damnit"

"event","Josh reminded me today that I'm 22
I was under the illusion (or is that delusion?) that I was still 21 and it made me sad to realize that I'm another year older with really nothing to show for it

Today is my TeiTei's birthday (that's my maternal grandfather) and he's 70 today. He's the only one in my family who actually calculates his birthday the ""chinese way"" that is to say with the lunar calendar so it changes every year accordingly. Anyway. I discovered that he was 48 when I was born and he became a grandfather about 4 years before that! My dad is 49 and there are still no grandchildren forth coming, at least not in the foreseeable future.

Next summer, my family is planning a trip ""home"" (Karachi, Pakistan) because one of my friends is getting married. She's 19 and it just feels so strange to think that she'll be a married lady soon while I've still never had an actual boyfriend. But that's the way things are done over there and I wouldn't trade places with her for anything."

My cousins and I actually woke up early today to go boxing day shopping. Our first stop .:Hourglass Comics:. for the 30% off all manga sale! Altogether between four gals we spent $200 on comics! ^^; that isn't lame at all! I finally picked up <u>Sensual Phrase vol.11</u> for myself as well as <u>Rurouni Kenshin</u> volumes 1, 2, 16, 17 and 18! yaaaay! <3Kenshin. They didn't have my <u>Gorgeous Karat vol.1</u> in and I was mad >__< so now I guess I'll have to reorder it and who knows how long that'll take! 

After that it took me about 30mins to find parking at Lougheed mall. I didn't even end up getting anything from there ^^; We stopped off at DViDEO so Kuolz could pick up ""The Notebook"" for her friend but there wasn't an available copy. I got to see Scott though :o he's really cute! I had the hugest crush on him before and sometimes I still feel a little nervous around him -_-; but aaanyway---

Then it was off to Chapters where I saw Josh (poor boy had to work on boxing day!) but I didn't get anything though I thought about picking up ""<u>Faking It</u> by Jennifer Crusie. However, I draw the line at paying that much money for romance novels. I'll just have to go to the used book stores again and find it for MUCH cheaper! At last at Coquitlam mall I finally got to spend the remainder of my $$

and it was so, unbelievably good. Going in I didn't think Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger really suited the roles but their performances were amazing. There were lots of prolonged silent scenes, but so filled with emotion and tt was just so beautiful and poignant and painful to watch at some parts. By the end I was crying so hard I had to cover my face but it's not one of those stories that you can cry about and then feel better; it leaves you with this aching feeling in your chest because it really exposes the raw, yearning pain and desperation of people in that situation. 

Well, I'm not trying to be maudlin, but here I am days later and anything that reminds me of that movie <i>still</i> makes me sad. On a happier note: Dinner <i>a la</i> Steve was delicious! There was turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes and gravy. He makes mashed potatoes with garlic creamcheese! I never knew there was such a concontion but it was so good that I must try it myself sometime. ALSO, I finally found the ONE store in all of Vancouver that had (Miyazaki's) <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> available on DVD (yaaae!) I immediately bought a copy for both Shwina and myself. Unfortunately the box set doesn't have the dubbed english version (Christian Bale's voice is SO HAWT!) so now I must return and exchange it >__< (Note to self: must not miss the 14 day return limit!!!)"

Yarn (and an acrostic) from Kuoli
Puma purse from Melody
A drawing of my character <i>Harume Frappachino</i> from Bobae XD
And last but not least, Jules+Steve+Jesse spent an insane amount of money to get me an easel! She says she is now responsible for the prolificness of my artwork XD lol

"event","<b>yowza</b>
woah... o_0 I just noticed that my lj thing is different but I don't know why and I'm possibly too dumb to figure out what just happened. 

<b>accidents happen</b>
Anyway, so last night, my sister's friend Derek calls me to say, ""Danyela had an accident! We're in the emergency room at the hospital!"" and I'm like... ""okaaaay"" At first I thought it was just a joke but it turns out my sister was playing volleyball up at SFU and she fell and hit her head on the floor. She was okay for a bit but then she started feeling woozy so they took her to the doctor up at the uni. and she couldn't do the balancing and 'follow my pen' tricks so Derek took her to the hospital where she had to have a CT scan and a gross IV inserted into HER HAND! It was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen! So that was my yesterday's adventure. I was mostly giggling through it because I knew nothing seriously was wrong with her and it seemed like a comical situation, interspersed with the one time I almost cried because it was kinda scary. Why does this stuff have to happen while my parents are away? I wonder. 

<b>mahsa-bombasa</b>
So Julie told me something funny... and yet not too surprising today. Our mutual friend Mahsa took it upon herself to enter my name in a bunch of online dating services. It's supposed to be a surprise, if she finds someone ""worthy"" that is. Julie thought I should be forewarned. Poor Mahsa, I think not getting any is getting to her. I don't think she's actually ever gone this long without having a boyfriend. Muaha! Now she knows how I feel, although Julie reassures us that it's much better to be single, somehow I don't believe her. It must be nice to have someone just... there. All the time. Okay, maybe it would be irritating but I'd like to experience it for myself atleast once before becoming a naysayer."

"event","OMG >_< something that fucking PISSES ME OFF! And I'm probably being a hypocrite by ranting about this but... why are people so defensive about things that other RANDOM people say/do online? I mean, it's not like you really know or care about these people or their opinions of you. And if you do, you shouldn't! +lol+ Anyway. So, this mini-rant came around from my totally innocent and innocuous comment on someone's art on DA. 

I saw this piece ---> http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/24434089/
and happened to comment [and I quote!] ""Lovely picture--- What are the chances?"" and linked her to this piece ---> http://www.deviantart.com/view/10053206/

The she's all like snotty ((or maybe I'm reading more into that was implied)) again I quote:
""Such that this character was designed before the piece you showed me..?
[link]http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/5715669/
[link]http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/6003208/
Please, first check the facts and than ask such things, ok?""

Now I feel like a bitch for ranting about it but like--- for fuck's sake! I didn't mean anything by it at all! Maybe ""popular"" artists are used to stuff like this from ""the public"" but I felt really confused because to me it was an unjustified reaction and seriously, I was thinking, <i>I'm not implying that you stole or copied the art! I mean, you said you did it +years+ ago and I believe you and you don't know this other artist so she didn't copy you either. I just thought it was interesting how some people's work can COINCIDENTALLY look so similar</i>

If she's that defensive maybe she has a guilty conscience +lol+ am I a bitch or what? And now I'm doing the exact same thing. Maybe she didn't mean it in a rude way either. So I said: 

""Erm ^^; sorry if that sounded rude. What I meant was that the costumes and poses are quite similar. I didn't mean to ""imply"" that you had copied it or anything and I'm sorry you got that impression. I think some people are too defensive online (I +guess+ it's understandable)"" 

I was trying to be sarcastic there, but my wit tends to evade people. Moving on! 

<b>HALLOWEEN</b>

This is turning out to be the worst Halloween ever T_T it's depressing. I have no plans and no costume, it's the first year I haven't made a costume and the thing is I don't really know why. Since my parents have been out of town I've been kinda unmotivated to do much of anything. 

Except knit and crochet XD +lol+ This month alone I've made more things (read: scarves) than in my entire lifetime. but they're pretty... and for some reason it's addictive. I need to get a new hobby!

Hmm... what I actually wanted to write about was me being unable to decide if I should grow out my bangs or not. I like having them because A) they're a real bonus for cosplaying and stuff ((not that my life revolves around that or anything...)) and B) because they can hide my fat head!! But I've had a bunch of people tell me I look better without them and I don't know what to doooooo because I liked not having them either, I think without bangs I look alot more mature so... yeah... too many decisions XP

"event","Didn't I already mention how much it sucks to be <b>the ugly girl</b>? Okay, so the last thing I need is people telling me that they thought the other contestant was prettier. Though I freely admit that Melissa is gorgeous and I love her cuz she is so sweet too! I know it's a stereotype but in my experience, beautiful people thing it's their prerogative to be mean to the rest of us <i>peons</i> ... aaanyway, I'll try not to let any of the bitterness seep through +<i>cackles manically</i>+ 

Even though... I'm 21 and will be 22 this year and I've been single <i>basically</i> my whole life. OMG haha, I recently found out that one of my first ever ""boyfriends""[quote/unquote] I only call him that because there's a lack of a better word, was arrested. Do I pick 'em or what? 

Oh, and my cousin read the cards for me, it was depressing so I have to do it myself again sometime to get a nicer outcome. Apparently I'm never gonna marry, but I will have one kid. The dad will be an asshole from Pakistan who drugged me and I hate him... yay! T_T +<i>cries</i>+ It's what I get for being such a bitch.

Speaking of bitches--- I can't believe Julie went to SanFran and didn't even tell me that she and Jesse and Carey and Keigan were all leaving. Not that I could've gone with them but it's still wierd when one of your best friends leaves town and doesn't even tell you +<i>le sigh</i>+ Now it makes me sad to think of all the fun they're having, clubbing it up in gay-central while I'm here.

On the bright side, my mommy just got me a new dress, it's this lovely shade of mint green ((one of my fave colours)) and it's for my trip to Toronto next summer! WOOBAH! for my cousin's 10th birthday. It's this asian thing, the 10th bday is uber-uber important. I had like over 200 guests to my 10th bday and I knew less than half of them. So yeah... woohoo! It's gonna be so great, I really miss mah boiz! [Kenny, Alby, Boo, Darryl, Michael, Matt---> this means you, and erm... DKNY you're not included, you freakish Sen-lover you!] But I need to lose weight cuz I'm fat and all those TO and Miami girls that're gonna be down there are uber-skinny (PUT ON FAT MELISSA!) and... yeah... ugly girl complex all over again >_< 

<b>FEEL TEH PAIN!!</b>
 
+haha+ that's enough of that. I have a new catch phrase---> ""there's no love like boy love"" 
what do you think about that? Hmm... I need to read more shonenai (as do we all) Over the weekend, my friend Kate was asking me why I like Yaoi and really... what do I say? What's not to like!!! My sister's theory is that with gay men, I, as an ugly girl, don't have to ever face the possibility of rejection. Btw, gay men love me, I am a faghag through and through.

<b>FEEL TEH PRIDE!!</b>

oooh, tomorrow I'm going to Metro/Crystal Mall, if anyone is interested! MEET ME THERE! After a few hours of pointless shopping we're going to go watch the new ""Brothers Grimm"" movie, which looks uber-cool and Tim Burton-esque! Speaking of, who isn't excited about the new ""Corpse Bride"" movie?!?!? XD it looks so rocking. My sister, cousins and I are totally cosplaying to opening night!! woohoo... really, it's any reason at all to wear non-normal clothes for us... 

Erm... this was just full of pointless babbling and feeling sorry for myself. Which is fun btw, so don't knock it until you've tried it. I've decided it's useless for me to fall in <3 because my dad is going to sell me to some rich Sheikh for a few million and that's that!

Unfortunately, like all my +cough+ ""love affairs"" I'm the only one who is aware and the guy usually doesn't know I exist T_T whatever works right? Oh, and I think he's a bit older than me (Ashley, you're prolly gonna ask about this I know +lol ) but that's okay, cuz I have a thing for older men, like remember that photographer that I was in love with who was 9 years older than me? mm... he was nummy +sigh+ Sorry for the babbling, I'm just writing this for myself more than anything so I can remember all the fun stuffs for posterity and stuffs. It's related--- really! Cuz I met this guy at the conventiooooon! 

Oh yeah, another Josh moment: He goes and like practically stalks that Johnny Yong Bosch who is his (Josh's) childhood hero aka. The Black Power Ranger (and <i>I'm</i> the freak? purlease!) takes his picture multiple times and even gets his autograph multiple times then tells me that that experience was worth every bit of pain of wearing the stupid Sorata costume and such... after I went through crap to get him that frigging jacket and HAND PAINT his frigging shirt >_< which I want back btw!!! 

I also discovered this new game, called 'ParaParaParadise' or something like that (there might be one less 'para' or one more, but I'm not sure) anyway, it's like... DDR for your hands and I watched some girls playing that they looked SO CUTE! they were all smooth and sexy-like and I was like... not. Anway, I wanna play DDR now. 

+giggles+ For one of the Idol days, three peeps were pretending to be like the American Idol judges and so one of them who was Anthony (or mebe it was Brian... sowwy I'm bad wiff names) was all like fakey-mean and it was hilarious cuz the crowd wuz all like booing him and stuffs. But they were so much fun, I asked him before the show if he was going to make me cry but luckily he didn't get me started (not that it takes much) 

OMG, I'm looking at picture of me online and I must <b>DEMAND THAT THEY BE ABOLISHED!!!</b> I look horrendific >_< if that's not a word, it should be cuz it describes me. I hate being the ugly girl

I won ^^; it was kinda surprising all around (well, to me) that I even made it past the first round cuz I was rather sick +<i>coughs up a lung</i>+ not to mentioned stressed out over the whole weekend since this was my first Artist Alley experience eva!

The other Idol people were teh awesomeness though, and I'm so glad I decided to go and not cop out (thought here was some copping out in other places) and they were so nice and yeh... I sang and english song XD bwahaha, which really screwed me over for later lemme tell ya cuz I can't learn new languages that fast and only know like... 2 japanese songs ^^; BUT I got a really awesome plaque thingy which is prettiful and I'll cherish it foreva!! cuz I've never gotten nething before. Plus I got the box-set of Lain, the InuYasha manga and a CD of... Hitomi +<i>insert last name here</i>+ which is kinda cool. 

OMG, I am so teh sadness T_T I lost the JAR shirt that I got from the JAR Dj dude (aka. Sean Cruz/CruzMissile .etc.), who was uber-cool btw, and dressed up as Chang WuFei from Gundam Wing (we call him Changles around here) so now I gotsta drive all the way back up to SFU to see if I can find it at the lost and found or something. I'm such an air-head...

<lj-cut text=""Rantage continues..."">Anyway, in AA, I sold out of my headdresses (pretty much as soon as I sad down), unfortunately nobody wanted my lil' country-loli hats which I have de uber-luv <3 for but obviously I'm the only one +cries+ I had to keep making headdresses every night which meant I was up until practically 5am everyday, then had to wake up at 8am to make it to the con on time to set up for AA not to mention erm... change into costume and stuff like that. 

Speaking of which, my costumes pwned!!! XD okay, not so much, but there was some pwnage cuz I looked good in my half-ass Oren-ishii kimono (IMO) which is to say, some people <i>actually</i> recognized me. It was so ghetto though +haha+ the black collar was just a piece of cloth pinned to my undershirt. My Arashi costume was soooo last minute it was like falling apart and I didn't have time to fix the frigging sleeves. And I had to (get this) HAND SEW the trim on +cries+ my eyes they buuuurns!! 

Then for the third day I had to rewear my Yelan Li costume from last year's con because my cousin and sister are like ""you have to sing, so you have to wear a pretty dress"" so I'm like ""yeah fine whatever"" and I was gonna wear my bloodred Arwen dress but then they're like ""but that's not anime"" and I'm like ""yeah fine whatever"" and ... gah! So, I looked ugly, cuz my belt was falling apart and I had to wear my hair up and no glasses which meant I couldn't hide my face >_< theeen sadly when I got home I was so exhausted I went straight to bed and my dad <i>accidentally</i> threw away my cool Yelan headdress that took me a day to make and now I'm sad...

For all the complaining I had soooo much fun! My camera wasn't working (da bitch hates me T_T ) which means I didn't get many good pics but that's what stealing off the internet is for (don't hate me! +<i>hides</i>+ ) I'm in the process of trying to find pictures of the girls I sold headdresses to so I can put them up here and be all like ""ooh, look at what I made and stuffs..."" Uwa! Who doesn't think Kakashi is the hawtest thing eva! +heart+ and there were so many of them wandering around, unfortunatly as I mentioned, no pictures. 

Oh yeah and theen on the day I was dressed up as Arashi, some girls are like ""where's your <i>lover</i>"" and I'm like +<i>shudder</i>+ Never ever EVER!!!... the ""<b>BAKA</b>"" is off somewhere, seriously... >_< Josh if you're reading this, you're a pain in my ass and you owe me money for all the time I spent on your frigging costumes that you barely wore!!!! [RAAAAGE!!!] don't worry, you'll be getting my bill. Btw, I heard what you said to Maxim about me and lemme say the feeling is mutual 6_6' not that I don't still <3 you, just not in large doses like the last weekend has been.</lj-cut> 

Aaaanyway, I think that's enough rantage about this subject, don't worry, I'll be back later, there's something else I need to uber-rant about >_< you're forewarned.

So, as you can tell, I recently finished reading the sixth installment of the Harry Potter ""phenomenon"" and I think it was fabulous even when I had tears streaming down my face. I won't say anymore but will put any more HP discussion behind a cut so as not to spoil it for those of you haven't read it yet!!

<lj-cut text=""Password is..."">

Aaaaand... the Half-Blood Prince is... <u><b>Snape</b></u>!!! muahaha (okay, just had to get that out of my system) C'mon, you knew it was coming. Although it did disgruntle me that there wasn't more on Snape's history which I had expected after reading HP5, and I'm still craving more on him so I hope HP7 will continue to bring surprises. I've been reading various forums and journals and there seems to be a consensus of hate toward Snape and Draco but I don't really feel that. In fact, I liked Draco, or atleast I felt much more sympathetic toward him in this book than in any other because you get to see him as a person who obviously cares about his family (though he does mention himself first when talking to Dumbledore). Also, I don't know if I'm being overly optimistic but I still believe in Snape and I don't think Dumbledore was wrong to trust in him. Maybe I'm making too much of it but Dumbledore's last words i.e. ""Severus...Please..."" sort of make me think it was part of a plan and that Dumbledore knew he was going to die. Anyway, I cried all through those parts, starting with ""The Cave"" and to the very end, it was just so... and I'm glad that Rowling didn't make it overly dramatic but it was very touching all the same and I'm so sad about what happened but I can't see the book ending any other way. 

Things that I am happy about Remus and Tonks!!! ^-^ aren't they just adorable? They're two of my favourite characters and Remus really, really deserves some happiness. Did anyone suspect that she was in love with Sirius as Harry did? I was put off by the fact that they're <i>cousins</i>!! Maybe that isn't wierd in Britain but yeah, I thought it might be the guilt but I'm happy to be wrong because they're such a cute couple and I can't wait to draw and see fanart of that ship. Also, another happy thing that surprised me was Bill and Fleur. Although I really hated Fleur through HP4 and later when I found out about her and Bill at the end she really proves herself and I think it's really fabulous how Rowling shows that even the most narcissitic person has redeeming qualities.

Something that majorly irritated me, and at the same time I suppose it was a long time coming... what was up with Ron and Hermione? You can hardly believe they're rational, young adults by the way they act! Won-Won was hilarious though XD and I'm glad to see a little development with Ron though not so much with Hermione. Also annoying, you think Harry would've learned about reading from mysterious books, at the same time what he says at the end there is right, summary: that the book didn't make him do it, it only provided the information. 

gah! too much to say and too little time!! will probably be ranting about this book for a while but now I have to go to dinner T_T

"event","Another picture I drew in english class today---<lj-cut text=""Click to view image...""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v459/ArwenSol/misclolicopy.jpg"" border=""1""> 
She's some kind of crazy sweet-factory lolita. I think this shows my craving to make a waitress loli-dress of some kind. They're just so cute!</lj-cut> 

I seem to get very artistically productive in the middle of my classes 6_6' possibly not the best thing, but I *do* hear the lecture so that's all right, right? I'm so sick of school though, I really wish I hadn't started summer courses but it's too late now so I'm going to look into taking next semester off. Hopefully my parents will be okay with that *crosses fingers* 

Just got my new Wacom Tablet and it is awesomely, however the pressure thing isn't working on Photoshop 7 so I think I'm going to have to install CS on this one (right now it's only on my other comp) That's the problem with having more than one PC. Anyway, in the world of more gadgety-fun, my sister just bought us a PS2 and some DDR mats, which is really uber cool and we've seriously not stopped playing since she got it :o Fortunately, my mom looks at it as a form of exercise and doesn't object *yay!* 

My cousins are leaving for TO on Monday to have a family reunion (other side) for their Grandmother's 50th (or so) birthday and I'm so mad cuz I don't get to go. 1) because I'm in summer school and 2) even if I wasn't in summer school I would have no money. It sucks being a poor student, I might have mentioned this before but it's a fact of life. So, to celebrate our last weekend together for a month, we got pizza and donuts and made piggies of ourselves and those donuts are now making me feel really, really ill >_< This might seem wierd to some people but we (my siblings and cousins and I) spend almost every weekend together and we're really close, probably because we all used to live together and grew up together .etc. so it's gonna be wierd not seeing them for a whole month, after all, when we don't see each other for a week it feels really wierd. Plus, lucky ducks get to visit all their cousins who are awesome people and so much fun while I'm stuck at home!! 

Atleast I have the anicon to look forward too otherwise I'd be really depressed. But I must get started on my costumes soon otherwise they'll never get done and I'll have to do something ghetto like I did the last year 6_6' I got a table at Artist Alley and will be selling prints as well as some hand-made gothic lolita accessories:

<lj-cut text=""Check it out <3"">
My favourite colour combo= white+red, though it's not as popular as the traditional black+white which I'll be making lots of, example: next picture
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v459/ArwenSol/loli-headdress.jpg"" border=""1"">
Your classic b+w loli headdress. I actually changed it a little to include bows beneath the white flowers though I'll be making a couple with some variations on bows, flowers and colour combos
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v459/ArwenSol/loli-headdress2.jpg"" border=""1"">
Country Loli straw-hat, it's really cute! Added some lace and I also made another one with oodles of flowers and ribbons!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v459/ArwenSol/loli-hat.jpg"" border=""1"">
Some randomness. It's not really lolita but from Ai Yazawa's manga: Paradise Kiss which does have some lolita influences. I'm not sure how many AY or PK fans there will be at the con but these were fun to make and if I can sell some, so much the better! ^_^ They're pins and earrings. I made a phone charm for myself which is so cool but probably won't be selling them...

"event","Oh, I'm maaaaad XP My sister got her hair cut how I wanted it done so now when I do mine everyone will think I copied her when actually... it was the other way around. *sigh* This may not be a big deal to some people but we're wierd about our hair, probably has something to do with the fact that we're 5 girls who spend way too much time together, for siblings. I guess it's all right, my hair won't be exactly the same since I have bangs but it makes me so mad because the lady I went to to get my hair done cut it wrong i.e. too short so now I have to wait for my hair to grow out before I can get it styled like I want T_T why is life so hard? Atleast it's summer so that means my hair will grow faster *crosses fingers*

So, did the karaoke thing *sweatdrop* it turned out... interesting 6_6' Yeah, I don't really like the sound of my own voice (especially recorded!) but my friends tell me it sounds fine so before I could talk myself out of the whole thing I emailed my demos into japan-a-radio. They should start airing after July15th and I'm a little afraid about other people listening to me but it's the price you gotta pay [haha-so melodramatic!] 

Here's just a litle something I sketched out last night while waiting for my files to encode: 
<lj-cut><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v459/ArwenSol/misclolidraw.jpg"" border=""2"" />
I also entered this design into a contest thingy in the egl community, so we'll see how that goes XD </lj-cut>

My cousin downloaded these songs from Kim Possible that are *hilarious!* You should go have a listen if you haven't heard already. Get ""The Naked Mole Rap"" and ""Drakken Rappin"" cuz they're really cute. Who doesn't think Ron and Kim should get together? 

Anyway...

"event","Just like everything else, LJ has officially become addictive XP blah!

Artist Block has come at the worst possible timing! I can't believe it's almost July, that means I only have about a month+1/2 before Anime Evolution and I barely have anything prepared for Artist Alley! *sigh* I don't know why but recently I've been feeling like all my drawings are crap, and my proportions are out of whack. What's worse is that I'm just too lazy to fix the problems. On the other hand, I'll be getting my tablet soon (yay!) so hopefully that'll perk me up enough to get working on stuff.

Besides art prints, I also still have a huge amount of egl accessories that I want to make and those can be time-consuming. I hope they sell though otherwise I might be discouraged for life [lol] The problem is that I don't know how many lolis are actually going to be at the convention, I've only met a few around here which might be slight problem. Oh well...

Despite the fact that I'm in the middle of classes, I'm more excited about the convention than anything else! I'm pretty much decided on which characters I'm cosplaying so it means I should get started on sewing soon too. (The list just keeps growing!) If you're going to the con- keep a look out for the following groups either walking around or in AA!

Day1: X/1999 -Arashi(me)-Sorata(Josh)-Yuzuriha(Chunni)-Aoki(Maxim if I can convince him!)-Hinoto(Kana)
Day2: Kill Bill - OrenIshii(me)- Crazy88(Josh)-Gogo(Kate)
Day3: I'm going either Gothic Lolita or in my Yukata, Josh wants to dress ""normal"" so he can go meet his idol at the panel *shakes head* the black power ranger... and he calls me sad...

I'm also planning on entering the Anime Idol contest, but time is rather running out so I don't know if I'll make it by the deadline which is on July 1st. But if I do, I'm sending in ""Scarlet-Ayashi no Ceres"" and ""Last Song-Gackt"" as my demos and hopefully I won't screw up royally like I did at Canadian Idol XP

In other news, my calves are really in pain from all those jazz jumps I had to do in dance class last Sunday >_< and my timing is still off which is worrisome since our performance is in two weeks. Hopefully I'll be able to fix it in clean-up otherwise--- look for me, I'll be the one falling off the stage. For anyone interested in hindi filmi dancing/bhangra/hip hop the Rangeela Dance academy is putting on a show at the Surrey Arts Center in Vacouver on the 10th of July. Tickets are $12 which is really expensive so I don't know what's up with that! Our picture came in Saturday's ""Voice"" which is really really cool and I'm still trying to get a copy of it!

Every Heart sunao ni nareru darou
Dare ni omoi wo tsutaetara
Every Heart kokoro mitasareru no darou

Nagai nagai yoru ni obieteita

<u>English</u>: <i>Tell me babe, how many do I shed my tears?
Every Heart EveryHeart is not a gentle yet

Shall I do? I can never say my loneliness
Every Heart doesn't know so what to say oh what to do

I was afraid of darkness cause I felt that I was left alone
So I prayed for help to distant million stars

Round & Round the planets revolve round the sun
And we always seek after love and peace Forever more
Growing growing woe baby we can work it out
Look up at the sky Every Heart is shining all today</i>

As usual... school is boring. I haven't been doing much save showing up for lectures. Today I also skipped the first half of my lecture, but I blame it on my sister for making me late. Don't you just hate walking into class late and everyone seems to turn and look at you accusingly, as if you've interrupted something important! ha! Like they were doing anything better. That's why you slip in while everyone else is going out to the bathroom *lol*

In anycase, this semester I decided to put myself out there a bit more and have therefore joined 3 of the fabulous clubs offered here at S.F.U. There's the Anime, Vocal Jazz and Archery clubs... all catering to my need for as little movement as possible. I've met some fun people at each venue and hope the association goes well though I've noticed I have a tendency to drive people away with my lack of conversation. blah! I just have nothing to talk about, is that such a bad thing? Why fill up silence with useless drivel. 

Hmm... in more news, my plans for going to Sakuracon are not coming along as splendidly as I hoped. Josh and I were muddling our way through the details this weekend and discovered that it would come to 130$ just for the two of us to attend! That's not counting monies for gas and actually printing out the artwork we were planning on selling. And in U.S. funds no less! I had really wanted to go but Josh (being the more realistic one) says that it might not be the best of plans and I have to agree. So now I'm looking into Animethon 12, hosted in Edmonton. Not necessarily closer but hopefully cheaper and also way in August (rather than April) giving both of us more time to make money to support our... habit ... 

Fortunately the other events are still on so I hope to be up and about, selling my artwork at a Japanese festival later this month and at a smaller convention at UVic in March (though I still don't have all the details here either!) Also discovered that Artist Alley for AnimeEvolution last year cost 60$ a table!!! It's bloody highway robbery! That means Josh and I will have to sell, at the least, 10 prints between the two of us and as much as I love my art... I'm not sure other's will have the same opinion of it. And, if people don't buy anything I just might cast myself into a pit of artistic despair (we have very shallow and fragile egoes, us artists 6_6') 

So... much... work. Still left to be done, it makes me cringe to think about it. And I'm not talking about school work either although presumably that'll get done as I go along. One hopes, anyway. So next on the adgenda is to start being more prolific with the art work so I'll have more to sell, plus making all the cute egl accessories I've been planning for so long. God bless the gothic lolita market! I have big plans for my line... but you know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men (Robbie Burns, we're studying him in class). 

Okay, I've rambled on long enough, I don't think anyone reads this anyway but I suppose it does help as a sort of personal catharsis. And besides, the way my memory is failing these days, it's nice to have annotated things to remember!

"event","<i>Like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free. 
Like a worm on a hook, 
like a knight from some old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons for thee. 
If I, if I have been unkind, 
I hope that you can just let it go by. 
If I, if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you.</i> 

So... a great many things happened last year, not only in my life but all around the world. Things that have affected a great many of us. Losses and tragedies that will be remembered for years to come, and while I sympathize and pray for those who have suffered and are still suffering, this journal is just taking a little time away from all that sadness to remember a few of my personal memories. 

Now, these aren't necessarily the best or the funniest or the greatest times, but for some reason they were quite memorable and hey, I have an online journal so why not send it out into electronic space and see what happens ^_^ 

Some funny conversations:
<i>On my choice of wall decor</i>
Sen: Do you realize that all the guys on your posters are...
Me: Prepubescent or gay? Yeah... so?
Sen: Well, don't forget the old dudes
Me: Shaddap

<i>On my 2004-crush. He's almost a decade older than me and I only spoke with him once online since he lives in another country but love grows where it will, and all that jazz</i>
Zaka: So have you ever met this person?
Me: No, he lives in ***. Ours is a distant love
Zaka: More like a distant lust
Me: Shaddap

<i>On the fact that 9/10 of my crushes have ended up being gay</i>
Julie: We're going to see the Faerie Queene
Jesse: Who's going?
Julie: Me, Leanne and Candice
Jesse: Well, that's perfect for Candice. She loves faeries and she loves queens. 
Me: Shaddap

XD I'm sensing a trend here. Anyway >_>'

Random kyoot-ness: Last valentines day, which always sucks for Julie and me cuz we're always single, she text messages my cell: <i>quote i thought of u: My girl leaves the room & angels weep, garden gnomes throw down their tiny picks and shovels in heartbroken sorrow. (from starbucks) Vday.</i> --- aww, isn't that cute (lol) I'm such a loser. Anyway, she's been together with Steve for about half a year now so I'm the only single one left... cuuuuurses

and last but not least, my favourite compliment of the year happened at the Odyssey which is this gay club downtown. I'm walking to the patio from the bar and this guy going the other way just stops and grabs me by the shoulders and says, ""Oh my god! You're absolutely gorgeous!"" and them him and his friend start talking to me and playing with my hair *lol* See, now wasn't that sweet? It means more coming from a gay man! really... it does... or so I keep telling myself >_>'

Yeah... this is just some random stuff, but seriously I can't remember everything that happened. All in all, it was a GREAT year and it would take me FOREVER to say everything I want to say so I'm just going to leave it as this ^_^

Hope your year-past was just as enjoyable! toodles!

"event","My sister started this new manga series ""Sensual Phrase"" aka. ""Kaikan Fure-zu"" and it is HILARIOUS! She also started ""Chobits"" and "" Forbidden Dance"" but I don't know which one she's gonna stick with. 

This one is (so far) the smuttiest out of the three and did I mention it's hilarious? haha! well, it is. I mean, what could be funnier than reading about two 17-year-olds falling over each other with lust? mm... fluff and smut. The combination never fails to amuse ^_^ it's true... and we all know it. 

Anyway, I thought I'd put down one (or two) of the songs I really liked ,for everyone to enjoy, and if you're intrigued I definitely suggest buying this product, just cuz manga artists are fragile and should be encouraged! So, do read on for a glimpse into the angsty lives of Sakuya and Aine...

Oh, and before we go on, *ahem* read ye DISCLAIMER: ""Sensual Phrase"" is (c) Maya Shinjo *blah!blah!* you know the rest ;) 

<b>.:From a Fallen Angel:.</b> [Aine writes this for a lyrics contest but Sakuya, the lead vocalist of 'Lucifer' appropriates it. Well, he likes it sooooo much that he asks (read: kidnaps) her to be the band's lyricist] 

<i>I'm more than a man and I don't fear falling
I've fallen further than your eyes can see,
But something inside me, your body is calling
I'm tumbling toward you like a doomed prophecy

I want you to run, want you to make me give chase
Beg for mercy when caught, tears staining your face,
Then succumb to desire, see with eyes open wide
As I tear into your chest and slide deep inside.</i>

[Bwahahaha! isn't that like the funniest thing ever XD *sigh* it's just me isn't it? Sorry... I'm repressed o_O ]

<b>.:Birdsong:.</b> [Sakuya sings this for Aine after he sees her crying... yeah, don't ask. Anime characters always seem to be crying]

<i>You, gentle whisperer
Do you feel me watching you?
My eyes mean to confess my obsession
I'm afraid of what will happen if they do

I belong to you it seems
In my dreams we love unfettered
But I don't know how to tell you in the sun

Forget everything about me that you've heard
Let's just fly away together, little bird
One day we'll fly away together, little bird

I'll be yours in the long tomorrow
And we'll love linesi nto our skin
We'll wake together with the sky

And when I give you the word
Then we'll fly away together, little bird
Winging toward forever, little bird</i>

[I don't know why but I luuuuurve this 'song', is it because I have no life? ""Yes"" Is it because I'm a romantic idiot? ""Yes"" Is it because I'm really that desperate? ""Possibly"" but whatever the case may be... it is quite pretty so I hope you'll think so too]

Now go out and BUY! [note: I have no stocks or investment in Viz Comics, but I do promote art in all it's forms!] Aaaand, in case you haven't guessed yet, the manga is rated ""mature""... that's naked people, lil' kiddies. So do have some parental guidance and whatnot (if required) ^_^ 
Laterz

"event","So Sarah is now almost 7 months old and is in a hurry to get to be a grown up.. For example, she went from not being able to crawl a week ago to now crawling all the time. And on top of that she is now pulling herself up on objects to a standing position. Last night she was standing watching TV holding onto the edge of the fencing we use to keep her out of trouble. 

At this rate I&nbsp;picture her wanting to drive to daycare by end of year (lol!)"

"event","There is nothing more entertaining than an idiot on the internet. I had one who had me laughing my ass off last night.<br /><br />I&nbsp;play poker on Ultimatebet. I do ok but I am getting better and it is mainly for the practice (and the entertainment as well of course) Anyway, here is how the idiot amused me. First a breakdown on what happened:<br /><br /><strong>Preflop</strong>: I&nbsp;was on the button with AKo. When it was my turned I&nbsp;raised. I was the first raiser. The blinds folded then the person under the gun called me. Everyone else folded. (Just the idiot and I left in the hand) (5.5 small bets in the pot)<br /><br /><strong>Flop:</strong> The flop is 647. Three different suits. Now this could be a dangerous flop if more people were in on the hand but chances are where it is heads up anyone who came close to making a pair or a straight had folded. The idiot is the first to act and bets. <br /><br />My thought process. Right now I&nbsp;have 6 outs to an overpair (3 aces and 3 kings)&nbsp;in a heads up hand on a rainbow board. I have about a 24% chance of getting one of these cards by the river. Since my odds are 3:1 and the ratio of the bet versus the pot size (pot odds) is 6.5:1 Calling here works. (If I were to raise chances are he will reraise so it would be pot odds 8.5:3 which is less than the value I&nbsp;need.) So I call<br /><br /><strong>Turn: </strong>The turn is now an ace. (467A). Yes! I&nbsp;have top pair with a great kicker! Idiot bets.<br /><br />My thought process. Chances are idiot should not be playing an A with a 467 so no two pair. If he had had the straight or the straight draw on the flop he would have slow played it. At this point I&nbsp;have the best hand. If he is playing a weak pair or straight draw I&nbsp;need to make sure he pays as much as possible with the worst hand. I raise. Which means the pot is now 7.5 big blinds back at him. Idiot calls.<br /><br /><strong>River: </strong>The river is a 9 (467A9) I still have top pair. Idiot bets. <br /><br />My thought process. If the idiot was on a straight draw he would have checked on the flop and reraised me on the turn to try to put me off of my chance of having a pair. No way he has it. Chances are he has a pair lower than mine. I&nbsp;raise. Idiot calls.<br /><br />Showdown is me with a pair of aces and idiot with a pair of wired tens. Yah! Go me! 11.5 big bets to me!! *snoopy dance)<br /><br />This is where it gets entertaining. Idiot proceeds to tell me how I was chasing and lucked out to beat him because my hand was &quot;dominated&quot;. I&nbsp;try to explain to him I was not chasing that I was playing with positive expectation value on my hand at that point so it was the correct action to take. <br /><br />&quot;You were chasin. I&nbsp;know because this is my life! Your hand was dominated and you dont know enough to fold&quot;<br /><br />Naturally I&nbsp;explain to this &quot;gentleman&quot; that his his a sorry life if this level of poker play is all he can aspire to.&nbsp; I had never been told I&nbsp;should go in the kitchen and &quot;make a bullet sandwich&quot; before this.<br /><br />He was giving me so much entertainment explaining to him that he is an idiot and that he really should work harder on his insults. At this point he tells the table off and goes to another. He has been SO&nbsp;entertaining I open that table up in another window so I&nbsp;can see how he does and I&nbsp;go back to playing.<br /><br />A little while later he busts out and is telling the people at that table how it is only the bad players who ever win at poker. So of course I&nbsp;have to pipe in with quips&nbsp; thanking him for showing us all how to play and loose our stake. And of course congratulating him on even loosing on the thing which he says is his life. <br /><br />&quot;I&nbsp;am going to come by your house and murder your family&quot; was his reply to my quips.<br />Me: &quot;Sure! Come on by! I&nbsp;am in Miami!&quot;<br />Idiot:&nbsp;&quot;I am in da 305 as well bitch.&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Great! Where do you want to meet?&quot;<br />Idiot: &quot;Ruth Chris. Dade aint that big a place for me to find you&quot; (Excuse me? This is the bad ass place to meet up to &quot;murder&quot; someone and their family?!)<br />Me:&nbsp;&quot;Ok. How about the one in Boca? I eat there all the time.&quot;<br />Sadly, at this point the idiot doesn't say anything back but instead logs off and doesn't log back on before I&nbsp;have to log. But he was very entertaining between his idle threats and lack of knowledge on poker. I&nbsp;hope to be able to talk to him soon.<br /><br />"

"event","Yesterday was the first day of my 37th year of life. I&nbsp;had a very good birthday in general but it did bring some interesting thoughts to mind.

I&nbsp;have always looked at birthdays as being a time that leads to a new year moreso than the &quot;new year&quot;. So while contemplating this I tried to think of the high and low&nbsp; points of the last year.

Highest point: March 11. The birth of my beautiful baby girl, Sarah Morrigan.

Saddest point: Being told there might be something wrong with my daughter when baby momma was around 12 weeks pregnant. At the time it was brought up that Sarah might have Anacephaly (Might not develop all of her skull/brain)&nbsp;and that I would have to wait 5 weeks to find out if my daughter would live or die.

I&nbsp;could bring up more. The basest point. The lowest point, etc.. I&nbsp;don't want to bore all of you. Suffice to say this last year has been one of the best of my life and I am sure it will just get better."

"event","I was shocked with seeing a change in my daughter. At this point she is 4.5 months old and I&nbsp;understand she is working on cause/effect. But to actually watch her test it out is another thing:

Yesterday I had been feeding her and set the bottle down. At that time she grabbed the spit cloth I&nbsp;had on her with both hands and moved her hands up so it ended up covering her face. (I am sure she was not intending to do that she just likes to play with cloths/blankets). She moved the cloth down uncovering her eyes so naturally I said, &quot;PEEK-A-BOO!&quot; which started a wave of giggling.

The amazing part was she then did the exact same action again (raising and lowering the cloth) then looked straight at me. At which time I&nbsp;said the same thing again and yet another wave of giggling occurred. She continued to do this for several minutes then she let go of the cloth. I&nbsp;guess she was bored. 

I&nbsp;have played peekaboo with Sarah before but I was always the one holding the cloth. This is the first time she was holding the cloth and covering her eyes. It might sound silly but to me this was an amazing thing. To watch the little poop machine interact with her world in a manner such as this. *sigh* I&nbsp;think I am in trouble. I don't have the voice to squeak loudly &quot;PEEK-A-BOO&quot; over and over again. It gets painful."

"event","The reason I say it is the weekend of balance is because it was a good AND a bad weekend. Let's watch the teeter-totter go back and forth.

Saturday:
(up) My daughter is starting to eat more again. She had not been eating as much for the last week so the spawnmate and I were getting concerned
(up) Sarah's doctor appt. we find out she is happy, healthy, and doing great. We are also informed it is time to start Sarah on solid foods. (Let the food fights BEGIN!)
(up) My daughter is in a very happy mood. She is having a great day. Playing with everyone and will not stop giggling.
(down) Have to give the baby shots for her 4 month appt.
(down) Baby gets to suffer through not feeling well (Plus there is all the tree hugger mumbo jumbo about immunizations causing autism. I am not a tree hugger but I&nbsp;hate the idea of even a remote chance of my daughter being harmed)
(down)&nbsp;have to work from home and clean up a server. Long way yet to go on this.

Sunday:
(up) My first father's day as a father!
(down) My first father's day without my father
(up)&nbsp;My daughter is doing much better with the 4 month shots than the 2 month. She is babbling and smiling away.. though she is a little fussy.
(down) My family doesn't call me on my first father's day because they are too busy lamenting the passing of my father. 
(up)&nbsp;Got new computer speakers as a father's day present
(down)&nbsp;get to spend the day with spawnmate-in-laws instead of playing Ghostbusters the video game (Iz way fun!!)

Overall I&nbsp;had a good weekend. There is very little that could bring me down from celebrating my first father's day with my little girl. I went trough a lot of hell in my life and thinking back over it it would not have been possible to end up with a bouncing baby Sarah if I had not gone thorugh each and every one of those things. So in the end it was worth all of it. Happy Father's day to me :)"

"event","I don't know if others would consider me still to be a new father since my daughter is now three months old but at least to me I&nbsp;am very much new to this. 

I&nbsp;had been thinking this morning as I lay in bed after my daughter scared the hell out of me this morning how the most beautiful sound I&nbsp;ever heard was the first cry in the hospital right after she was born. I will never forget the feeling right then and there.


Now, on to how my daughter scared me half to death this morning. Since Sarah was born I&nbsp;have been in the habit of getting up in the middle of the night at least once or twice a night just to check on her. (even if it doesn't sound like anything is wrong). This morning around 3 am when I did so she was lying on her side with her arms and legs stuck straight out in front of her. On top of that her skin was cool to the touch and I could not hear her breathing. 

At least I did not pick her up and start yelling at her to try to get her to wake up. I did move and disturb a sleeping baby though. Not the brightest idea but better than the massive coronary I had been having. After she was now in the waking process I had to try to soothe her back to sleep and creep out of the room. 

And I thought I would get to wait until she was solder before she would get a chance to scare the hell outta me."

"event","First off I&nbsp;would like to comment on a baby food company and their success with making sure their name comes to mind. When we were going to the OB doc we were given a kit with stuff from a company called Enfamil. Just before Sarah was born we were given a small kit with a changing mat, etc.. in it.

When Sarah was born at the hospital we were given more free goodies including a diaper bag from Enfamil. Then when we went to the pediatrician they gave us an insulated bottle carrier. 

Finally they sent more samples and a huge can of formila for a &quot;free sample&quot;. Their marketing works well I bet. I&nbsp;know that is what we are using for Sarah.


As to Sarah. Well she is turning out to be quite the babble-butt. The older she gets the more she is carrying on. She also seems to like smiling and giggling at people she knows.

I&nbsp;cannot believe how lucky I&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;have a baby that only cries when she needs something (wet, hungry, a nap, or attention) She will not just sit there and cry for no reason. She has an even temperment and loves to play with people. and to top it all off she is now sleeping 8 hours a night at 2 months old.&nbsp; If there is something people say makes a baby a good baby that is how Sarah is.

I&nbsp;thought it would be so much worse being a parent. But I&nbsp;must say it is a very nice thing."

"event","Everyone who knows me by now I&nbsp;am sure knows I&nbsp;have a beautiful daughter. (They also know to be careful mentioning her as I will carry on and on like a normal dad talking about her)


One of the things I like to do is I keep an eye on her milestones in comparision to the range of milestones for children her age.&nbsp; I&nbsp;must say I am a little concerned. I was not until I read a few months ahead to see what to expect and to try to be a little more prepared but anyway:

From right after Sarah was born if spoke to her from within her range of sight she would stare at you. Sometimes she would watch your hairline or yoru jaw, but sometimes she would watch your eyes. (And it is kind of creepy to have a 1 hour old stare at you almost unblinking as you speak to them)

Here are some of the reasons I think I have put myself &quot;into the soup&quot; so to speak:

4 -6 month old babies will start to babble. They will start saying things like &quot;babababab&quot; and &quot;gagagaga&quot;&nbsp;etc.. Sarah started this at about 6 weeks old. As the last three weeks have passed she &quot;talks&quot;&nbsp;more and more to the point where every person who sees her at her daycare center as commented on it. 

At about 2 months old babies start to giggle. At 5 weeks was the first time Sarah giggled.&nbsp;She has not stopped yet.

She cannot talk yet but she is quite a little mimic.I should post some videos of her trying to repeat things said to her. 

I&nbsp;see three possible courses. 1. Sarah slows down to coincide with the average and everything goes on, 2. Sarah stays ahead of the game and her parents have to do a merry dance to keep up with her, 3. Articles start floating about her room and we start hearing organ music in the background in the middle of the night coming from the air.&nbsp;

I am not being the normal dad saying my baby is so advanced (ok, I&nbsp;am but that is beside the point) Quite a few other people comment on her talking all the time. 

Anyone know where I can find a young priest, and an old priest?"

I had thought the changes would be gradual and the milestones reached in a slow plodding manner. NOPE! Most of the time it is one day nothing, the next day talking your ear off. This is not a complaint mind you. This is just me stating it is an amazing thing to watch. 


If you have a child and decide you don't want it make sure you get rid of it before they look up at you, smile, and giggle. At that point your stuck because there is no way you could get rid of it."

"event","This weekend I&nbsp;put together a miracle berry gathering. What this involves is sitting around with a group of people, and after eating special &quot;miracle tablets&quot; tasting a bunch of different things.

Now I know what you are thinking. There was nothing illegal in any of this nor was there anything The miracle tablets have a protein in them that binds with the sour taste buds. What this means is you basically can only taste sweet, sour, and bitter. What I thought of some of the thigns:

Lemon:&nbsp;Pure lemon tastes like nice sweet lemonaide. No problem eating this.
Lime: Limeade from Sonic. Not sour at all. Was very refreshing
Apple: Apple tasted basically like apple
Grapefuit:&nbsp;I don't have a problem with grapefuit normally but it was great without any sugar on it.
Ride Wine Vinegar: Anyone who knows me knows I don't like vinegar. This didn't bother me. Unsure how to describe taste.
Balsamic Vinegar: Another one that didn't bother me. Cannot explain the taste though
Sour Gummi Worms: Pure sweet
Feta Cheese:&nbsp;Was rather bland and creamy. No bite to it at all.
Key Lime flavored water: Was like drinking pure sugar.
Tobasco: Tasted like a honey based barbecue sauce: 
Lime flavoured hot sauce: Tasted like a molasses based hot sauce to me. My roomate who doesn't like the taste of hot sauce actually thought the hot sauces tasted good even though she could feel them &quot;burning&quot;

I don't remember what else (if anything else) we tried. We only used half a tablet each of the small dosages. With the larger tablets and using full ones I am sure it would have lasted longer and possibly been stronger. It was a lot of fun none the less."

"event","In the last few days I have been watching my daughter trying to work out our language. It is interesting to see how rap of attention she pays to speech. Also to watch her imitate movements. She is starting to make more noises now, and from what I understand this is normal as she learns.

Sarah seems to be building her own language and her mother who spends the most time with her has learned a lot of it. Baby momma can tell when Sarah is wet, or bored, wants her pacifier, or can tell when her diaper needs to be changed by the sounds Sarah makes and how she moves. If that is not communication then I do not know what is.

The point this brought to mind for me though. In the past I have off and on (mostly off) studied Japanese. I like the language and their taste in movies/TV. Watching my daughter fight to learn a language has inspired me once again to try to learn Japanese. If I can just keep myself from getting bored with it and switching to a new subject it doesn't actually take that much effort. 

What I&nbsp;mean is for example, In the last two days I have managed to memorize about 75% of the Hiragana characters. If I can just keep myself on subject an studying a little while everyday I should be able to finish memorizing Hiragana and start on Katakana in no time. 

There are also a couple of applications I have that are good for learning Japanese vocabulary and grammar. 

If Sarah can do it then I can too! Just gotta not flake *sigh*"

"event","You know, If you looked at my life about 6 years ago you would never have plotted a course that would arrive with me being here either. Just to touch base on what life was like:

I&nbsp;shared a townhouse with me (now EX!) wife. I moved into that situation because I&nbsp;felt bad for her because yet another person could not stand living with her and she had no place to go.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;slept on a matress in the living room and gave her the bedroom to 1 bedroom townhouse.

Even though I&nbsp;have two dozen computer certifications I was making slight more money at my job at the time than I could have working full time at a fast food place. (I will not state the number. It is just too depressing to me and I don't want anyone falling out of their seat laughing) Also I&nbsp;had a boss who seemed confused because I had the highest customer sat scores, Most fixes per day, most systems worked on per day but was getting sub par evals due to the fact his boss didn't like me and they wanted me to quit.

My entire life for entertainment was playing video games and with action figures with my friends (Hey! This is still cool!)


Now my life is: I live with a woman who appreciates me. (Also it is not because she pisses everyone else off who knows her.) I&nbsp;have a bed to sleep on instead of the floor (although I do tend to sleep on the couch some because watching HDTV all night until you fall asleep is fun.

I&nbsp;have a job where 1. I don't have to kill myself at work normally. (I&nbsp;spent a period of two weeks watching seasons 1-4 of Numb3rs at work) 2. My boss will give me something to do then not mention it again (most of the time)&nbsp;3. Where I get credit for doing my job correctly and 4. I make more than 300% more than I did at my previous job.

My life for entertainment is.. well that might not have changed too much. I&nbsp;play less video games, I&nbsp;don't play with action figures (need to find a new game like that that I enjoy) but I do hang out with my friends.

Oh yah, and the final thing is I&nbsp;have a beautiful baby daughter who when I&nbsp;see I cannot help but smile. 

I&nbsp;am happy to have a real job. I am happy I am away from the psycho-ex I&nbsp;used to live with. I&nbsp;am happy I&nbsp;have the bouncing baby S. (you know they don't bounce well?)  I would never have seen myself ending up here. But I am happy where I am. Well except for the fact I don't play well enough at poker, I&nbsp;am happy with where I am. 

And once again I have to say it because it feels good to do a little happy dance whenever I say it, &quot;My ex-!&quot; *snoopy happy dance*"

Little things worry me about the things I say. Teaching a child to be a misanthrope is not a good thing. You don't show the real world to a small child. You don't tell them the truth of existence. but yet one slip of the tongue and I could hurt her forever *sigh*

If I falter or lag at any time in regards to her then she suffers. I have never had anyone need me that much. I&nbsp;would be lying if I said anything other than that scares the hell outta me.

The logic and reasoning in this movie is astounding. For example, all dinosaurs were plant eaters during the time of the Garden of Eden. It wasn't until sin that some of them started eating meat.

"event","I was listening to the news this morning on the way to work when a story came on about what they were going to do about the education budget. They are trying to come up with radical ideas to pull yet more money out of education. I just wanted to touch on a couple of the ideas I&nbsp;heard:

1. To not pay teachers for two days of work this fiscal year and to pay them for it next year. So the teachers would have issues with their bills and whatnot this year. So the teachers might not be able to pay everything they need to which puts them in a worse situation. Also do they think things will magically turn around next year and they will be so flush with extra cash that an extra couple of days of pay won't matter?

&nbsp;I think more likely what would happen next year is they would come up with a reason why they could not give the teachers the money for those two days. Either that or try to make it a trend and start skipping paying teachers for those two days every year.

2. To drop school to four days a week. Here is the rocket surgeon plan. First they get to cut teachers and all other staff at the schools to save money. Second of all things like school food, electricity, and water would be used less this way. 

&nbsp;Who can see a downside to this one? Better question, who CANNOT&nbsp;see a downside to this one?&nbsp;You start off with the same problem above with the teachers getting shafted on pay. Next you add in the entire staff at the schools getting shafted. On top of that you add that since a large portion of families in the state of Florida are two income families, now parents have to come up with some way/place to keep their children an extra day of the week. Considering South Florida is not a rich area this is going to be a major belt tightening for these families. 

And this doesn't even touch on the fact you will not be able to squeeze the same amount of teaching into 20% less time so versus the rest of the country you end up with the kids here getting less of an education."

"event","I went on for quite awhile about my dad when he was dying and when he died. I think I have done well moving on with my life considering he has been dead a month. By this time more often than not I don't think about it anymore.

Today looks like it is not going to be one of those days though. My family is driving to the west coast of Florida to have my father's ashes scattered at sea. So this of course means it will be in my mind for the next couple of days as they wend.

I cannot go because:
1. My spawnmate is ready to spawn and I am sure a 5 hour drive would not be good.
2. My spawnmate is ready to spawn and I cannot afford to be 5 hours away. I have to be there for the birth of my spawn.
3. At my office we are setting up a new 3,000 sq ft. area and it seems I am the one coordinating all the crap that must go on for this to occur so missing a couple of days for something like this would be bad timing.
4. My boss' wife is pregnant as well. If something happens like her going into labor we cannot have both him and I out of the office at the same time.


I am sure my father would understand if he still existed as more than a pile of ashes in a black plastic box. I&nbsp;am sure he would tell me to do what I am do which is focus on family and job. After all, that is what he did his entire life."

Because the time is getting so close my spawnmate and I&nbsp;are working on getting the spawn's room all set up and I&nbsp;have noticed something:

I&nbsp;used to make fun of the parents who go through all the time and energy to decorate a room for an infant or a small child as their tastes change so rapidly. Yet now with the actually going to be a parent I find myself doing such things. Between myself and my spawnmate we must have spent a couple hundred dollars just on decorations so far and we are not done setting up the room yet. 

In my defense though, I was not aware there was so much Disney Princess stuff out there to decorate my little princess' room. When we are done I&nbsp;am thinking of posting some pics of the room so everyone out there can laugh.

On a different note. We swung by a consignment shop this last weekend to see if we could find any baby clothes we wanted. (They grow out of the stuff so fast it's not worth it to buy everything new and replace it almost every week) While there I saw a book on the shelf I&nbsp;had not seen for sale in a long time.

Don't worry friends, I am not going to start in on how Edison was a major ass (everyone knows that)<br /><br /><br />What I did want to talk about was one of the last two major ideas that were brought forward by Tesla. Tesla for awhile was working on the idea of being able to transmit electricity without the use of wires. He had worked on this idea for awhile. At one point he had stated he was close to the solution with his 57 meter tall tower built for this purpose. JP Morgan was the investor and pulled out his funding because there would have been no way to track how much to charge people if electricity was everywhere for everyone. The idea of wireless power went the way of the dodo.<br /><br /><br />Jump forward into the next century. It seems a group's experiments might have come up with a way to not need power cords in a location. While it might not quite be what Tesla had envisioned, it would be same general idea. Also who knows if we would not end up with Tesla's vision?<br /><br /><a href=""http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/37532"">physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/37532</a><br /><br />"

I&nbsp;would hop out of bed and get on to doing whatever I was going to do (cartoons, xmas, the weekend, etc.) 2. Was try to burrow back into my bed and go back to sleep since it must be a school day.

Being older I have noticed I&nbsp;think of the bed much different. On weekends I have the habit of just laying there and thinking after I wake up. On weekdays I wake up early and just lay there thinking. No more leaping out of refusing to get up. It's much nicer and a lot more relaxing this way. Nothing worse than leaping out of bed because it is the weekend and having your unstockinged feet land on the cold floor in winter. Not a fun experience.

Oh and one other difference about beds and sleeping. Now that I am a grown up (still not an adult) naps are great!!!"

"event","Friends! The truth has been hidden from us by the scientists who wish to control the way we think and what we know to be true. We know the truth of what happened with the dinosaurs but they try to mask it!!

You see the truth is God created the dinosaurs on day 6 along with all the other creatures and with man. At that time all creatures got along and no one ate meat. (I do have to say though, the plants got the bad part of this deal) The truth is in the bible. It explains how god created the animals (even if it states nothing about dinosaurs) and how everything got along.

Then we go forward a little more in time. Adam and Eve ate the apple and so every living thing on the planet is punished for this crime.&nbsp; This is when people and creatures start eating meat, and things start dying, etc..

A little further forward and you get to the time of Noah. I&nbsp;guess he didn't want all the dinosaurs on his ark and left them behind. During the great flood they all died and were buried. That was about 4300 years ago. THAT is when all the fossils were created.

I&nbsp;have found out this must be true. If you accept the word of the bible and look at all the evidence you can think nothing else! How flawed in the head are these so called &quot;scientists&quot;?!

"event","This last Saturday 1/10/2009 my father stopped breathing. Once again I state I cannot call this his date of death since his higher brain functions were gone as of 1/8/2009.

There will be no funeral because my father did not want one.
My father did not want to be buried so he will be cremated.
My father wanted is ashed spread into the ocean in Florida. He always loved the ocean and fishing. This is illegal, but it is what my father wanted so therefor it will be done.

Anyway, Just a quick little post about my dad's life. Nothing big since I&nbsp;will be going out this Friday to drink and celebrate him:

My father was born in 1945. His first job was working on a tobacco farm at 16 when he moved out on his own. This job didn't pay much but it kept a roof over his head and he was able to buy a scooter to get around (I&nbsp;have seen videos or this.. funny as hell). He went to votech school instead of finishing high school and studied to be a cabinet maker.

When my father was 18 he started going out with my mother. They were married two years later when he was 20. Their two families could not stand each other so they got married the only way they could, If you go someone pregnant back then you married them (Way to buck the system!)

At 21 years old his bouncing baby daughter was born. He had been overjoyed at this and went long and far, here and there telling everyone about his daughter and to show her off.

At 27 years old his son was born. While I am sure this was greeted with much joy I&nbsp;am sure he didn't except the handfull I would turn out to be ;) &nbsp; 

At 34 my father moved from the Northeast to Mississippi. At this time his career of working retail until he died started. He showed an aptitude for getting done what needed to get done so worked his way up quickly with any company he worked for.

At 54 his grandson was born. My father seemed to take great delight in having a child around the house again. Between having a kid to spoil and being a grandfather he spent a great amount of time with him.

From 34 until 57 he lived in many areas of the country and travelled when possible to others still. Like taking a 16 hour bike ride and ending up in another state (He didn't get out of bed the next day because he was too sore to move). At 57 he and his family, minus the son (me! me!) moved back to Mississippi.

From 57 to 62 my father lived in one place. He quit the 2nd to last job he ever worked because they fired multiple people and expected the crew of 30% do to the same amount of work. He found another job working in retail and of course was quickly promoted to assistant manager (since he turned down the manager position at not wanting all the stress)

At 62 my father semi-retired. What this means is he was only working 4 days a week. He spent a lot of time with his family especially the grandson he doted on.

At 63: My father found out he was going to be a grandfather for a second time. A little later in the year he found out he was going to have a granddaughter. This is a very good thing because girls always held a special place for him. While sons and grandsons are a wonderful thing daughters and granddaughters are the things that made the world go round.

X-mas of my father's 63rd year went well. He had a lot of fun and was given quite a few present he wanted. (Surround sound for his tv, a DVD vhs deck, etc..)

The plan for New Year's was since he only worked 4 days a week he would have a 5 day weekend and spend the entire time with his family. The day before his long weekend started he collapsed from an anurysm. Ten days later he started having strokes which quickly destroyed his brain in the course of a day. Two days later they pulled the ventilator. He died an hour after that. 

Goodbye dad. I am sorry you will never get to meet your granddaughter but I promise you she will know all about you."

I&nbsp;do not say when he dies as that has already occurred, his body is just not aware of it.

Just a quick run down since I am not posting to outside mostly about this:

On December 30, 2008 my father was found on the floor of his house after an anurysm. He was taken to the hospital and we were informed things did not look good.

On Jan 2, 2009 It seemed he was improving some. He could state who me, my sister, and my mother were. He didn't have&nbsp; access to all his memories at this point because the anurysm had occured near the hippocampus. Signs had been good for him to make a recovery (unsure as to what level). At this point he was able to hold my mother's hand and tell her he loved her.

On Jan 6 and 7, 2009 they were concerned about vasospasms and the pressure increasing in his head. As well at the bloodclot that formed during the anurysm.

On Jan 7 - 8, 2009 my father had his first stroke and then had several others as well. They ran MRI etc. tests on him and found the left half of his brain to be severly damaged. More damage to the hippocampus and other areas of the brain. They found out at this point that my father's higher brain functions are gone. That what made my father my father was gone. 

On Jan 8, 2009 the decision was made that they would stop supporting him. They are going to remove him from the ventilator etc and let him die (which is what my father would have wanted)

When he does die there will be no funeral. My family will get together somewhere in Florida at the beach to spread his asses to the beach and sea as he wanted.

Long live C.S.H. May I do your memory proud."

I don't know how people can do this multiple times. Just surviving with one on the way is almost enough to have a heart attack

Anyway, We ended up with a nurse seemed to think &quot;baby momma&quot; was full term with Sarah even though she is only 30 weeks along because of the size of.. well something or other. I don't remember the term used. Also the &quot;baby momma&quot; doctor made a joke about our &quot;96 lbs. baby&quot; that we are going to have. From things like this I am guessing Sarah is not a tiny little thing. After all this rambling here is what I am getting to:

Edit: One thing I did forget to mention is she is breech right now. Which means if she doesn't turn they will do a c-section which does kind of set an upper limit on birthdate. They will check at 36 weeks (Feb 7th or there abouts) and if she is still breech they will schedule a c-section.

Starting a pool (no money involved) on birthdate and weight. Feel free to post your choice but don't pick the same as someone else.
Due Date: March 7th
Average weight for full term baby in America:&nbsp;7 lbs 11 oz.

Rivals guess:&nbsp;Feb. 7th, &nbsp;&nbsp; 7 lbs. 8 oz.
Baby Momma:&nbsp;Feb 14th, 8 lbs. 4 oz.
Baby Momma's Momma:&nbsp;Feb 15th, 8 lbs. (forgot the ounces, but I will check)
Baby Momma's Daddy:&nbsp;Feb 21st ,&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 lbs. (forgot the ounces but I will check)"

"event","Ok. I will not name the show because I&nbsp;do not want to spoil anything for anyone.. BUT:


During a popular TV show they state that Einstein states if you move fast enough you will travel back in time.. *screeching brakes* What? 

What Einstein actually stated was 1. The amount of energy for anything to travel faster than the speed of light would be infinite due to the fact the mass of the object would become infinite. Therefore you cannot travel faster than the speed of light. 2. Even speaking about relative velocity you cannot exceed the speed of light.&nbsp; If two cars drive away from each other at the speed of light each how fast do they seem to be going relative to the other?&nbsp;Answer?&nbsp;The speed of light!!!

While scientists have managed to increase some fequencies in a band of light to greater then the speed of light the entire wave stays below 186,000 mps so no laws broken. 

To travel back in &quot;time&quot; all the particles you are moving must violate charge and parity symmetry at the same time. 
&quot;Wait a minute Mr. Wizard! Are you saying all that matter would have to become anti-matter all at the same instant?&quot;
&quot;Why yes Timmy, That is exactely what I am saying. Stand still Timmy. I will show you why this doesn't work.&quot;
&quot;Gosh Mr. Wizard I&nbsp;feel (giant nuclear explosion from the annihilation of the matter of Timmy when the air around him touches anti-matter Timmy)&quot;
&quot;We're gonna need a new Timmy.&quot;

People seem fascinated by Einstein and his theories and want to use them to explain anything about whatever. People seem to love jumping on the ideas of special and general relativity and use them to do anything, like it's a superhero universe or something.

*sigh* I&nbsp;can point out a lot more on why this doesn't work but talking long term to a blank wall is boring. Besides which, who cares if the TV passes on data people will think is real who then go forth and propoate this data to others?"

"event","One thing you hear a lot of is that the housing market was the main contributor to the way the economy is today.&nbsp; Then listen to all of the political commercials saying the govt is to blame for all of it. People really should try to consider the bigger picture:

People blame the govt. left, right, and center for the housing market. While they did deregulate some, there should have been no need to have the regulations in the first place. So I guess the government is partially to blame because they were not forcing people to not be idiots?

People blame the loan institutions. I agree they are more to blame. Instead of trying to play fast and loose with people they should have taken a little more of a longer view. I.e. someone paying you mortgage payments for 30 years = more money than kicking them out in three years to try to resell the home. SO yes they are more to blame than the government but they are still not the source of the problem honestly. 

The real problem came into play when people decided they could buy a house with 1700.00 a month in mortgage payments making 30k a year with four kids. These people should have sat back and thought about what would happen. I&nbsp;don't even mean in general. I mean to them.

So we have the government not forcing people to be mindless automatons and to be able to think on their own what they want, intermixed with companies deciding to try to shuck people for what money they could as quickly as possible, and the idiots out there who decided they want to put themselves in a situation they could not recover from. 

The way I see it is in the end the morons who decided everything that glitters is gold are the ones who caused the housing problem.

And before anyone rips into me, I&nbsp;am not talking about the people who have been foreclosed on because of the changes in cost around them. People who owned property and were paying on it then gas prices, food prices, etc.. shot through the roof because of everything going on around them and were foreclosed upon. These people I do feel sorry for. The others who caused it.. Not so much. 

The companies ripping people off and the people who don't think about what they do are why the govt gets to control so much Because people refuse to do it themselves."

Many years past it was much more difficult to look for information on movies so there was a lot more chance of missing them.<br /><br />The first movie I&nbsp;heard of in an ad at a movie theatre and then didn't hear another thing about it for a couple of years. The movie was finally released and I was able to track it down. The movie was the original <strong>Warlock</strong>. Drove me nuts for a couple of years trying to find it (in the time before the tubes)<br /><br />The second movie was more recent. I would say within the last 10 years. I&nbsp;had seen something about a movie having to do with travelling back in time to some long ago dinosaur based time. But while back there the people change something and come back to a different world due to the &quot;ripple effect&quot;. This was another movie that did not come out for quite awhile after it was first being advertised. The name of the movie is <strong>A Sound of Thunder</strong>. The sad thing is the movie was terrible :(<br /><br />Third movie driving me insane I&nbsp;have yet to find. The movie involves a man who is some form of math professor who has been in a car wreck. A detective (or something similar) is asked to go into the math professor's mind to try to find some answer he had been working on. With the damage to the man's mind though he is not sure what really occured with the car wreck and the reality within keeps switching. <br /><br />At the end of the movie it turns out the detective (or whatever) is actually the math professor and all this has been a delusion while he was under surgery for a blood clot putting pressure on his brain after the car accident. At the very end of the movie he states a paraphrase of the old Chuang Tzu quote, &quot;Am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man or a man dreaming I am a butterfly?&quot; while staring in a mirror. He then removed the top of his skull (not long after the surgery) and there is a small butterfly on his brain. <br /><br />I saw this movie at least 6-7 years ago. I think it was more like 10+. I did not have Tivo or a DVR etc.. at the time. I also did not turn on the channle the movie was on until somewhere in the middle. I&nbsp;have been looking for this movie off and on since then. When I do a search on the net though Butterfly Effect (retch!) and people talking about the quote are 99% of what comes up. Now there is also a new movie in 2008 called Butterfly Dreaming which fills up more. Anyone know anything about this movie I am looking for?<br /><br />"

"event","Anyone remember this commercial from when Wii and PS3 were about to come out/came out on the market?<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFoyp71xw3w"">www.youtube.com/watch</a><br /><br />Anyway, My roomate and I broke down and purchased a PS3 finally. We did have many and sundry reason for doing so:<br /><br />1. I already own a Wii<br />2. The price of a Blu Ray player is $399.00<br />3. The price of a PS3 is $399.00<br />4. The war is over between Blu Ray and Hi-def DVD. <br />4. &quot;It's the future!&quot;<br />5. My roomate and I are electronic junkies.<br />6. It's cool.<br /><br />Setup was very quick and easy except for one thing. The PS3 only comes with an RCA for hooking up to the TV. WTH?! Spend $400.00 on a game system and you don't even get component or HDMI. Good thing I&nbsp;thought to ask and bought a HDMI cable before we left. One other thing that was a bit annoying. The controller is USB and comes with a 3 foot USB cable. Who would sit that close to a game system/TV to play?&nbsp;(I found out later I&nbsp;am an idiot and the controller only has to be plugged in to charge as it is wireless)<br /><br />So, on to movies. We rented &quot;The 5th Element&quot; in blu ray to try it out. WOW! I have to say it looked frickin incredble! Not much more I can say on the fact other than that and the little ads you see showing &quot;DVD versus Blu Ray&quot; are the truth. I didn't think I would see much of a difference at home away from the displays but I&nbsp;was wrong! (We have since changed our movie rental accounts to Blu Ray already&quot;<br /><br />Also rented a game called &quot;Folklore&quot; Not too bad a game but once again I&nbsp;have to say &quot;WOW!&quot; when looking at the graphics on it.&nbsp; I am running around playing a game and it looks almost as good (if not as good)&nbsp;as CGI movies. No complaints on that at all.<br /><br />One other thing we had not been aware of when we purchased the PS3 but will be a major boon. If you have a media server of some form setup you can watch videos, listen to music, view pictures from it. This is not as bad as it may sound to any non computer geeks. You can use something like Media Player 11 to be a media server. So now all the stuff I find on the net we can watch directly on the TV, I&nbsp;don't have to burn it to DVD first. At this rate I am going to have to setup another computer at the house just to hold and handle media server requests. <br /><br /><br />"

"event","I just got proof that I am getting old. Not getting older, getting old. I can prove this because my friends are getting old.

I can remember going to every concert I could even if I didn't know the band because I enjoyed it. Now none of my friends will any longer go to concerts because of the following reasons:

1. It is too loud -&nbsp; Some of my friends don't like their ears ringing after a concert or are concerned with hearing loss (earplugs anyone?)
2. Stamina - Some of my friends think it is too exhausting to go to a concert let alone to go into a pit. (no doze and red bull anyone?)
3. Waste of time - Why go to a concert when you can have the cd which sounds perfect unlike a concert that is distorted and filled with yelling people?
4. Computer game or something on TV - This is the one that really scares me. You have a band everyone likes but people won't go to a concert because they want to watch something on TV or there is an event in a game that they don't want to miss. 

I think the above prove my friends are old. Not getting old, OLD.. as in mentally. 

Corollary - If my friends, the people I have spent years with are old then I too must be old. *SIGH* This sucks!!! When do I have to get the trimmer for earhair and start bitching about kids on the lawn or how much better it was when I was a kid?!"

"event","I watched a very bad movie last night where the antagonist is attempting to kill a plethora of people to gain immortality which got me thinking about what immortality means.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Useless drivel about living forever"">
The dictionary lists immortality as unending life but that is not very clear if you think about it. Does that mean if you are immortal you can never die? What if there is no air? Or you do not eat for several years or are stuck in the middle of the Antarctic? Do you just continue living?<br /><br />If we accept the idea that being immortal means no matter what you keep on living I would have to say that would suck! Can you imagine what would occur within your ""lifespan""?<br /><br />100,000 years from now mankind has evolved into either a higher or lower life-form while you stay the same. No way without some form of external substance or device to try to blend in. And you definitely would have a problem interacting with them as the changes in though process would happen for them but not for you.<br /><br />Also on average it seems IQ is climbing 3 points every decade for the last century or so. (They move the bar of ""100"" to be middle line) If that pattern were to continue, in a hundred years the average immortal person from our age would be 100 IQ while the average person walking around would be 134.91 IQ. In other words compared to our immortal person the trailer park living, truck pull watching, inbred S.O.B would be almost genius level. You would have no place in society at that short a time period. About all you would be able to do is sell Venusian fries with the space burgers.<br /><br />Let's go further into the future. In 4-4.5 billion years you would have to watch your home planet die within the fiery embrace of Sol. On the plus side it will be warmer on the moons of Jupiter by this point. <br /><br />We can go even further yet. Within a trillion years most if not all forms of fusion in the known   universe would have burned out so all that would be left would be cold matter with black holes being the only source of energy. From this point on things only get more cold and more empty until enough time passes that the amount of volume has increased enough to drop the amount of matter left within it to be close enough to zero to only be counted as zero.<br /><br />So there you are. Floating at Absolute Zero. Floating literally in the middle of nothing. Nothing to ever change beyond this point as entropy has increased to it's maximum within our universe. Would the possibility of a few billion or even a trillion years of life and entertainment be worth the billion billion billion, etc.. years of nothing that would occur after? I am not a religious person but this situation does strike me as being ""Hell"""

"event","For the entire month of July one of the helpdesk people at my office is going to be on vacation. Now this would not be a big deal but he is the early person that comes in for it so of course I am getting stuck covering the phones and email for two hours until someone else comes in.

The reason I have named this post as I have is because I swear every time I have to help these people I feel myself die a little inside. The fact these people are allowed to drive cars, or worse vote frightens me on a deep level. Example:

1. Computer won't power on but the power button flashes. Instead of shutting the computer off and turning it back on this person who is a floor manager demanded we fix the computer.. that she had put into standby. What is worse about this is a server that handles a database every person at the company needs access to was having a problem at the same time and this person was telling me how her computer at her desk not working was more important than the database that 70-80 people need access to to do their jobs.

2. Computer doesn't power on at all. What they have done is plugged a cheap surge strip into a power plug then plugged a computer into this PLUS three more block power plugs. Gee can you say overload? I unplugged one of the blocks, reset the strip and the computer works. Now let's see. If you rig this up and all of the sudden the computer doesn't work. What could be the problem?

3. A user cannot find the attach email button in Outlook 2k3. I tell him to use help and he thinks I am telling him to call help. He cannot even figure out where the help button (the one that says help) is.

So you see, I think this couple of hours a day working the helpdesk is killing me by inches."

"event","Or better known as the reason I seem to loose money sometimes at the poker tables:

Anyone who doesn't player poker, a calling station is someone who stays in hands WAY too long and keeps just calling hoping to get that one in 40 or that one in 1,000 full house they need to win. Playing against one of these is not really a bad thing. You just have to be a little more careful. Playing against multiple of them though can drain your money down quickly. Here is an example:

I am on the big blind and get crap cards (6d Tc) but hey I can limp into the hand if no one raises. No one raises so I get to see the flop.

Flop is Td 6h 2h. At this point I am showing top two pair on the board which is a very nice respectable hand so I bet. The THREE calling stations at the table call.

The Turn card is played so the board is now. Td 6h 2h Jd. My two pair is still not too bad a hand but I am drawing against two flush draws at this point. At this point including me there are four people in the hand. I bet. One of the calling stations fold, the other two call. Three people left. My hand is looking better and better.

The River card is played. The board now reads Td 6h 2h Jd 9d. There is now a flush draw on the table but no one has shown any strength so I bet.. and am raised?! I think about it and no one would have the diamond flush. It would have been stupid to play it. 

So time for the showdown. It is just me and one of the calling stations left. He has in his hand 3d Qd!!! WTH!? The hand goes to him and I start ranting. Who the hell would play Q3?!

Breakdown on the numbers:
Flop: Pot = 2 small bets. 
On the flop I had two pairs. I had a good strong made hand with 4 outs to a powerhouse hand. Because this is a limit table and they are calling stations I did what I could and bet. (about 16% chance to get a full house)

He on the flop had a backdoor flush draw. This means he needed the turn and the river to both be the same suit he has. Other than that he had queen high. No one in their right mind would play this. (about a 4.134% chance to complete flush and 12% to a pair of queens that would not win)


Turn: pot = 3 big bets 
On the turn I still had 4 outs to a full house (about 8%) but chances are I have the strongest hand unless someone has the heart flush draw

He has a flush draw (18% chance to complete) nothing else can win it for him. To get the proper pot odds at this point he would have to be getting 4.1 to 1 to his bet. Even with my bet he is only getting 4 to 1 so yet another stupid play but he does it anyway.

Well the river, Not much I could have done on the river except call him for the one more bet.  

In the end I saw justice though. He left destitute from the table. That is what occurs to calling stations."

So here is some of the things that came up while on the way there and while at the park:

1. A trailer in a trailer park with an El Camino parked outside flying a rebel flag.

2. A woman there stating they had to leave early because they had to follow the directions to get back in reverse which added, ""an extra complication""

3. Rednecks, Drunk, whooping and acting like idiots. At one point I was waiting for them to fall out of the sky gondola.

4. A drunk college kid thinking it would be cool to feed the albino peacock a beer.

2:30 this morning laying there abed staring at the ceiling. Checking the clock every few minute to wonder how long I have been awake and to try to figure out if I have enough time to go back to sleep. This has to be the worst form of insomnia. If you just have a problem sleeping then you stay up and do what you were doing or whatever. However when you wake up in the middle of the night and cannot go back to sleep you seem to hold onto that idea that yes indeed you might get back to sleep if you only lay there long enough staring at the back of your eyelids. 

(sigh) At work at 4:30 in the morning because I finally gave up. I wonder if I can talk my boss into letting me leave early since I am in 2.5 hours early."

"event","I am willing to bet most people think an Infrastructure Manager is there to make sure users have access to everything they need and want to get access to. Sadly these people are incorrect. The true job is to make sure said users have access to as little as possible so they cannot break crap. People like Helpdesk and whatnot are there to make sure you can get to stuff you need to.

 Sometimes I like my job. Other days like today I love my job. I am working on GPOs for a network transition from NT to AD. (Yes yes I know, time to get into the 21st century already). I am still in the process of setting up the primary GPO for the floor but I must say I am rather impressed with my handy work. So far at this point they have access to six applications and nothing else. They cannot actually do anything on the computer other than run those apps. And if they are nice I might let them have something other than a plain black background for the desktop they are not allowed to have :)

I must say it is going to bring great joy to my heart when we roll out the new images. When the users on the floor decide they want to try running Toontown, Itunes, or watch Divx. Their consternation and cries for more rights shall be the music of the celestial spheres to add wings to my soul.

And the best part is, When all of them are going to be going rabid, yelling, and trying to draw blood from anyone they can.. It will be up to helpdesk to face the unlearned masses. I will just be sitting in the back room locking them out of yet more they wish to access.

For the next step after that will be to block ANY website that is not related to our company's focus. Go TEAM Go!"

"event","Last night I had to go in to get an MRI done. It was at that time I learned I might not be able to have MRIs:

First off the slide they had me lay on was as wide as my shoulder blades and that is it. Had to lay there trying to ""be comfortable"" As they poked and prodded me into different positions on this  little rail-table to get me into the machine. 

Next step is a brace to hold my head in place. Either the shape of my face/head is freaky or the technician needs to learn to adjust to situations. The brace that she was saying was supposed to press on my cheekbones would lock in place putting a large amount of pressure on my eyeballs. No way I was going to lay still for 25 minutes on a rail-table with hard pieces of white plastic putting uncomfortable amounts of pressure on my eyes. After about 5 or so minutes she gave up and only locked it in on one side and put it across my forehead. 

After that comes the slide into the bore of the machine. The machine slowly slid inside, my arms hanging off the rail-table into the bore. And this is when the real fun for me began. I found out as I was going into the machine that the bore was just SLIGHTY larger than my shoulders. I could not even have begun to shrug in this machine. 

So let's see, Locked in place, laying on a too small table, in a small enclosure that is not wide enough for my shoulders and they want me to lay perfectly still for 20-25 minutes?! NO FRICKING WAY that is happening. 

The problem is I am not claustrophobic per se. I don't mind small spaces etc.. What I do have a problem with is feeling restrained. Anything that makes me feel like I cannot move if I decide to sets off my fight-or-flight reaction. And when I do panic about it I go all out (lol). In that respect it was good the machine was as small as it was or I would have been trying to break my way out. As it was I only able to yell, try to kick the machine I was in up to my ankles and squeeze the ""safety"" bulb. If this place had had a newer MRI chances are I could have done it. But as wide as my shoulders? No lights inside? Not going to happen"

The bad thing about it is, Whenever you think of a random movie you want to see you can ad it to the list and it is shipped to you. Right now looking at the list of movies I have selected there is no possible way I will get through all of them. I am up to 301 movies on the list so far. If that was all and I was not adding more to it it would be fine. The problem comes in every time I go to their website I think of several more old movies I want to see again. It is like a drug.

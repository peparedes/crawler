"event","Whoops, I forgot to give an update regarding my previous post, how thoughtless of me. My mom made it through the surgery, and aside from the long scar across the front of her neck she is doing just fine. The amazing thing is that three doctors had previously diagnosed her with cancer, but after examining the part of her thyroid that was removed from the surgery, there was no cancer to be found. The doctors couldn't explain it, but I sure can.  Thanks so much to everyone who prayed for her, it's obvious that God still performs miracles even today.

Well it's just a couple more days till I move into my new house. I really wish I could be more excited about it, but I'm more nervous and anxious than anything.  I just hope I don't pass out after I hand the title company that cashier's check on Friday.  I've already payed $5,000 in earnest and this final closing payment is going to be more than twice that much.  That's going to be the single largest amount of money I've ever turned over at one time thus far in my life, by far. I haven't even bought a fridge and washer/dryer yet either.  And then I'll have to buy nice new furniture because my old apartment stuff will look like crap in a brand new house.  Ok, I'm going to stop now because I'm getting nauseous just thinking about it."

"event","Well after years of padding other people's real estate investment pockets (renting), I've finally taken the leap to home ownership.  Being the new venture that it is for me, my feelings of excitement are somewhat overshadowed by feelings of anxiety.  

They currently have the frame and roof completed, and will be doing the dry wall next. I met with the builder yesterday and he expects it to be completed around mid-October.  It's progressing super fast, hopefully it will still be quality work.  But I'm impressed with the other homes they've built, and the models were amazing. Here are some specs on it:

~2,875 sq ft
2 story
4 bedrooms
study
gameroom
media room (converted 5th bedroom to this)
dining area
kitchen, breakfast nook
living room

The media room will have two levels for elevated seating, and I'm having it prewired for surround sound so I can install in-wall speakers. Also planning on installing a DLP projector, for a mini-theater setup.

Here's a few upgrades I got, pulled off my purchase agreement (most of this doesn't mean much to me to be honest, lol):

Premium lot (larger back yard on golf course)
Hardwood Floors
Solid granite countertops
All stainless steel kitchen appliances
Stainless steel undermount sink
Recessed can lighting
Custom kitchen backsplash tile and accents
42"" Raised panel cherry cabinets
8' six-panel front door
7"" double-staged crown molding
Twin panelled french doors for study
Wrought iron stairs with waterfall stain grade, oak starter step and volute
Rounded sheetrock corners
etc, etc.


Here is a link to picture, floor plan and virtual tour of the same model that I bought.

I was actually somewhat pleased how it turned out, given the aforementioned ingredients. It's obvious I can play keyboard better than sing, but too my credit my voice was kinda shot today. I may do some more tomorrow if I get bored again and my voice clears up. Enjoy!"

"event","That was the closing line to <a href=""http://denver.citysearch.com/profile/35699806/"">Cowboy Bebop: The Movie</a> (at least it was something to that effect).. that I just got back from watching at the bankrupt United Artists cinema in Boulder.  It was a basically like a typical Cowboy Bebop episode (which isn't a bad thing at all), but stretched out to about 2 hours.  Definitely entertaining, and somewhat thought-provoking.. 

I'll be picking up the DVD when it comes out here in another couple of weeks, I believe.  I still haven't bought the regular series on DVD yet... for one, I want the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005QCW4/103-8125591-0266257?vi=glance"">Perfect Sessions</a> box set, however it's going for crazy prices on eBay (the real one anyway if you can find it, almost ALL those on eBay and other auctions are burns/fakes.. good rule of thumb, if it's not going for at least $300, it's not the real thing), and I don't like it THAT much to drop $300+ bucks on it.  I actually do have the first session DVD, that my ex bought me a while back, but it's still in the shrink wrap.  The current DVDs are actually pretty barebones... I guess I'm just holding out in hopes that they'll release a new box set with special edition DVDs.

On a related note, my otaku-buddy Julian that I watched the Bebop movie with, just informed me that they're going to be releasing a new DVD box set of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000639E0/qid=1055654990/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-8125591-0266257"">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>, of which I just bought the old set for $100... frickin figures.  So why is mine called the ""Perfect Collection"" then?  I guess the new one is gonna be ""The More Perfect Collection"".  I know it's kinda stupid, but it bothers me when I own a DVD and they release a better version of the same movie/show.  I feel almost compelled to buy the newer one, and I almost always do.  I'm sure the movie studio's love suckers like me..."

"event","Howdy people, hope all is well in LJ-land!

Well it appears as if my post frequency has slimmed down to the ""once a year or so"" update.  I thought it would be nice of me to let everyone out there know I'm still alive.  RealLife has been kickin' my arse lately.  My job takes up most of my time, and my girlfriend takes up the rest of it.  If there's any time left over from that, you can usually find me spending it on the slopes carving some fresh powder.  

Speaking of fresh powder, holy balls it's been snowing out here a lot the last couple days.  It finally stopped, but there must be at least 2 feet on the ground now-- perfect for a huge snowball battle royale!   I just finished luring the gf outside to show her all the snow.  Translation-- to show her a fat snowball to the back of the head, muhahahhaha.  She's really happy that she just got her DSL hooked up a few days ago, so we've both been working from her place.  I guess that is one cool thing I can say about my job is that I can work remotely when I need to.

Lately I've actually been contemplating going back to school and taking some classes in 3D animation.  My dream job has always been either working for a movie company like Pixar doing artwork and/or animation, or working for a video gaming company.  My original intention was to major in Graphic Design, although at the time back in '95 all they really offered at OU was Visual Communications, and they weren't doing much in the way of 3D animation.  So yeah, I chose college over career.  So now I'm wanting to go back and do it right the 2nd time, before I get too dang old.

I guess a lot has happened in a year, let's see... 

Bought a 2002 Nissan XTerra, 4X4 SE Supercharged loaded last year to make boarding trips up the mountains a little easier.  The old Sunfire just wasn't cutting it.  

Got hit my some huge bouncing metal object while driving on I-25 that jacked up said XTerra and nearly took my life.  

Got deathly sick last December to the point where I could only drink liquids because I was throwing up anything solid I tried to eat, and couldn't even sit up in bed.  Probably would have kicked the bucket if it wasn't for my awesome girlfriend taking care of me.  

Went on a trip to New York City for the first time in my life.  Saw Les Miserables on Broadway!  Got to experience riding in a subway and walking through Harlem.... very interesting.  

My sister had a baby boy!  This was exciting for us as some of you know she has a disease called endometriosis from which the doctors said she probably would not be able to conceive.  She named him Heath... er??

My girlfriend bought me a fullsize Yamaha 88 key electric piano for my birthday last year, I love it!

My DVD collection has grown to somewhere around 200, I got tired of counting.

Bought a Gamecube so that I could get Metroid Prime and also Zelda when it comes out in a few days (got my preorder in!)

Still haven't bought a  widescreen tv yet.  I've been holding off hoping that prices on plasma tvs will go down, which doesn't seem to be happening any time soon.  A plasma would be ideal for me since I live in a 3rd floor apartment and getting a 60"" widescreen rear-projection up 3 flights of stairs would be a major pain in my arse, not to mention my back.  I noticed that Gateway has put out a plasma for $3,000 and I've seen a couple at Cost-Co for around $3,000, but from what I've heard about the Gateway, and seen myself with the ones at Cost-Co, the quality doesn't seem to be that good, especially when viewing normal broadcasts it appears very pixelated.  I've decided that $3,000 is my limit, besides I really can't afford anything much more expensive.

Watched Stomp for the first time in Denver the other night, it rocked.

I played on a flag football team in the Denver Sportsmonster league last fall with some guys from work.  Man did we suck.  They ended up putting us in a league with like ex-college and semi-pro players so that didn't help either... we lost every game, haha!  I did have 5 picks one game though.  I think our QB threw more interceptions than he did receptions.  Ah well it was still fun.

Mandarin and I have been talking about putting up a website where we can showcase our mad 3D designing skillz, but so far it's just in the conceptual stage.  Ok so we're having trouble thinking of a cool domain name.. so if any of you have any bright ideas, please let me know.  And no stupid stuff like holyballs.com (that one's already taken).  

Well I'm sure there's some just as boring stuff that happened to me that I'm just forgetting about, but if I have any other brilliant strokes of genius I'll be sure and let ya know.

Man, it's been awhile.  A lot has happened since I last visited this page.  RealLife(TM) has taken hold and doesn't want to let go.  I won't bore you with the details, so here is a brief synopsis of semi-interesting goings on in my life for the past couple months.

- Flew home to Oklahoma for two weeks to be with my family for Christmas.. (Colorado's nice but Oklahoma will always be my home)
- Got a nifty iPaq pocket pc from my parents
- Been snowboarding 6 times now (3X@ Breckenridge, 2X@ Keystone, 1X@ A-Basin) I'm getting much better =)
- My DVD collection is now somewhere in the 80s I think (I got tired of counting)
- Bought myself a Playstation2 for Christmas, got SSX Tricky and Final Fantasy X
- Just got my first cell phone yesterday.  It's pretty cool, <a href=""http://www1.sprintpcs.com/explore/PhonesAccessories/PhoneDetails.jsp?selectSkuId=tp5250NVP&PhoneName=showcaseB&Link=Link1&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2421&CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_SCID=10149308&CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_PCode=nvpE&CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_cartState=group&bmUID=1012012047473"" target=""_new"">here</a> is a picture and specs if you're interested.  It has the ability to download new ringers and graphics to it, but unfortunately they don't offer it on business plans, ie. the one I have through IBM.  Ah well, guess I'll just have to wait for some geek out there to write a program that will do it... or write one myself =).
- My friends left on a weekend trip to Vail, and I sit here confined in my apartment with this crappy hotpager
- Going to buy a widescreen TV sometime soon if I can bring myself to cough up that much cash... it's weird but I've found that I get nauseated when I have to fork over a large amount of money... like when I have to pay my rent each month =|
- I am now a single guy once again..."

"event","I <i>still</i> haven't gotten to go snowboarding yet.  Hopefully that will change this weekend, I'm really amped to go :).  OK I stole ""amped"" from a commercial that just came on for a snowboarding game of the same name on the X-Box.  Looks really cool, maybe even better than SSX Tricky.  That along with HALO make me want to get an X-Box but I'm still gonna have to stick with the Playstation2 since only it has Final Fantasy X.  

My car has been acting strange ever since the cold weather hit, and it finally decided to poop out on me on the way to work today.  So I had to walk a mile back to my apartment freezing my buns off along the way.  I then decided to walk back to it and get the battery out (which was dead) and carried that back to charge it up.  When my friend Brian (who lives below me) got in from work, we drove back and put the battery back in.  It started up and I was able to drive it back to the apartment, but I'm afraid it might be the alternator.  Guess I'll find out when I get up tomorrow morning.  Methinks it's about time for a new ride-- here are a couple I've got my eye on...

Newest DVDs in my collection:

- <b>Willow</b>
- <b>Willy Wonka</b> Widescreen
- <b>Shrek</b>
- <b>Die Hard - The Ultimate Collection</b> box set
- <b>Toy Story - Ultimate Toybox</b> box set (off eBay)

Let's see, that brings the total to... <b>71</b>.  Is it an addiction?  Of course not.. I can quit any time! ;)  I'll definitely be adding <b>Monsters Inc.</b> to the collection when it's released on DVD.  I watched it one night at the cool Westminster Promenade theater and really enjoyed it.  I do believe I liked it better than both the Toy Stories and Shrek.

What about work?  Oh yeah, that.  It's going just fine actually.  I don't overly enjoy the work, but not many people get to start off in their dream job immediately out of college.  However, the company is very stable, the work isn't too difficult, the people are nice, and the pay I can't complain about either, so it will do for now.  I definitely don't plan on doing the same thing the rest of my life though, not to say that it won't be with the same company.

Welp kiddies, that's the ""What's goin' on in the Life of Bone"" monthly report for November.  See ya back again next month.. Not so same Bat-time, not so same Bat-channel."

Obviously, these wouldn't be funny if the first picture was real.  But hopefully you all know that it isn't.  For one thing, what are the odds of snapping a picture at that very moment, and what are the odds of that camera making it all the way down, unscathed? I didn't do too hot in my stats class, but that must be somewhere around a billion to one chance.  Also, why would the guy be wearing heavy winter clothes in Fall weather?  And the most revealing: that picture was taken from the 2nd tower.  There's no way those guys could have been oblivious to what was going on at the first tower.  But if you still don't believe me (or all the credible news sites that also say it's a hoax), here's recorded proof that the guy is OK...

Standing in the door
Stay with me a while

September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before

Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play

A friend of mine named Brian that I met here (he lives below me, and also started working for IBM at the same time) just sent me some pictures he took at a Rockies/Braves game that I went with him to a couple weeks ago. The Rockies got spanked as usual, but it was still fun since Brian had never been to a pro MLB game, and the last one I had been to was a Texas Rangers game about 10 or so years ago.  

In other news, I watched the somewhat sad performance by OU in their first game of the season.  They did win, but the offense seemed terribly lacking.  Hybl has some large shoes to fill, and I believe he realizes that.  It was his first ""real"" game however, so maybe (hopefully) he'll start gaining a little more confidence.

Finally, I ordered my home theater system, and 4 of the speakers (Polks) have arrived so far.  They look pretty nice, but it's really annoying just having them sitting here and still watching DVDs through my mono tv speaker waiting for the receiver to arrive.  The whole thing ended up costing around $1,500 but I paid a little over $400 just for the receiver, an Onkyo TX-DS595 which is suppose to be pretty nice, although I've seen other receivers for $2,000. The cable I bought just to hook my DVD player up to the receiver cost me $45, but it was an optical, and Monster brand at that, which is pretty much top of the line.  I didn't order any Monster speaker wire though, because I heard that Home Depot has a really good price on some quality 12 guage wire, so I'm just going to go that route. Everything else should be arriving this week, so I'll let you know how it sounds when I get it all hooked up."

Lord, could you send someone my way
who understands my heart
I've tried and failed with broken dreams
I don't know where to start.
One who understands the pain inside
will take the hurt away
My deepest thoughts I can confide
Will turn the dark to day.

There's a love deep down inside of me
A dying, unheard song.
Waiting for this one to come
Alone, the journey has been so long.
Send her please, and let her know
my love will be her guide
to find me here with open arms
forever by my side.

She doesn't have to be a beauty queen
that's not the meaning of love
but what's within, the joy you share
is a gift sent from above.
When I find that special one
my heart will always be true
finally knowing what it's like
to have someone love me too.

After claiming for the longest time that the <b><i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory: 30th Anniversay Edition</i></b> DVD would be released in its OAR with an anamorphic transfer, Warner Bros announced that it is now going to be released Pan & Scam only.  What a bunch of complete idiots.  I did have it preordered, but cancelled it right away when I found this out.  It seems that online e-tailers like Amazon are kind of upset about it too. Please take the time and click on the picture below which leads to an online petition you can sign to state your disgust with this poor decision.

In other news, I just learned the title of Star Wars Episode II.  <b>Attack of the Clones</b>?? What the heck is up with that, it reminds me of Mars Attacks! or something.  An exclamation mark <i>would</i> make it better, actually.  But then again, I guess Lucas didn't lose too much sleep thinking up such brilliant titles as <b>Return of the Jedi</b> and <b>The Empire Strikes Back</b> either.

I had never heard of Salvador before, but apparently they are kind of popular in some circles. They had a nice Latin beat.  It was pretty hilarious watching some of the spectators trying to salsa.  Another singer, Lincoln Brewster who I had also not heard of, was pretty interesting.  Kind of reminded me of a Christian version of Green Day.  My favorite though was yet another guy I hadn't heard of, named <a href=""http://www.scottkrippayne.com"" target=""_new"">Scott Krippayne</a>.  He played the keyboard and sang, and did a couple of really great songs. One he wrote for his wife, called (I think) ""Seven Years, and Seventy To Go"" he had never sang before, and she was in the audience since it was their anniversary.  Another one he wrote for his little daughter, <a href=http://www.scottkrippayne.com/audio/MayIhave.mp3"">May I Have This Dance</a> was really pretty... I think I had something in my eye during that song ;-).

"event","Hola! Work is starting to get better now that I've actually been given some responsibilities and have something to occupy my time.  A lot of accounts that I'm in charge of are starting to migrate from AIX to linux which is really cool.  My project manager knows that I'm pretty knowledgeable with linux and told me he wants me to be in charge of linux development.  

I just got a pager with text capability, so if any of you get the hankerin' to page me, I set up a <a href=""http://page.bonebox.org"" target=""_new"">webpage</a> where you can send me a text message! Oh yeah, and if you do, don't forget to type in your name too because my psychic abilities are growing weak as of late ;)

Changing the subject, I do believe I'm becoming addicted to DVDs.  My current <a href=""http://www.dvdaficionado.com/dvds.html?cat=1&id=fone+bone"" target=""_new"">collection</a> continues to grow, and I just ordered 3 more today, not to mention about 10 preorders. Stop the insanity!! :)"

"event","can i face another day
of hurting heart and empty soul
without some love along the way
i can never be completely whole

this world is a deceptive place
my happiness is only show
love must be a type of grace
i'll never be allowed to know

it is a burden i must bear
one who truly knows how to care
and love, but i can't seem to find
like my friends this peace of mind

of artifice, it's just a game
expecting me to do the same
trick one into loving me
when i really don't, you see

this is how my heart did break
but i won't again, i swear
give my heart up to a fake
since shattered dreams i must now bear

no never will i give my heart
or rather give what's left i guess
until i find the missing part
each night praying God do bless

this one last hope i'm clinging to
a love that i have yet to see
out there with a heart that's true
in time, will share her love with me

and make my dream, reality.

Afraid to love again

the world began to darken
and i couldn't see.

in the night you reached for me
to help me understand
what true love could be if

but in the dark i was unsure
""just wait for the day""
then somehow i lost your touch

"event","I apologize for posting all this old stuff I've done, but I find it kind of therapeutic for some reason. I guess it reminds me of a time when I was a little less cynical, albeit a little more naive. Here are parts of a few songs for a musical that I tried to write, but got frustrated early on and never completed it. The plot for the musical could be said to be a cross between <b>Pinnocchio</b> and the musical, <b>Godspell</b>. I actually hadn't heard of Godspell at the time so I didn't realize how closely this resembled it until later. It's about a doll (symbol of innocence and purity) who comes to life but can only be seen by children and adults who believe that he is really alive. To others he appears just as a normal doll. It starts out at a carnival where the dollmaker has a shop set up, and this rich aristocrat comes in and purchases this particular doll for his daughter's birthday. The daughter however is a spoiled brat, and although the doll grows to love her, she throws him out on the street. The dollmaker finds the doll here, but realizes that he is a special doll, and will have a great influence on people. So he leaves him, where he is eventually discovered by a poor peasant girl, who thinks he's the greatest thing in the world. They grow to love each other, and the girl soon realizes that the doll has the power to heal others. But here is where the details are kind of sketchy, because I never worked it out in great length. There is another guy however, who firsts appears to be their friend, but eventually betrays the doll to the evil king. Close to the end he heals the king's sickly son, but dies in order to do it. (To be totally honest, the majority of these songs, like ""Why Can't She Love Me"" and ""Here"" I wrote out of personal experiences before I came up with the idea for a musical, and then modified a little to fit).

<lj-cut text=""On to the songs..."">
When the first bratty girl throws him out, this is (part of) the song he sings (please remember these are just bits and pieces of songs I jotted down at different times, so some of them might not be that coherent.) I do however have most of the music written out for all of these (which I'm much better at than writing lyrics).

<center><b>Why Can't She Love Me?</b>
I know that I'm different,
To be normal, how I've tried.
People say I don't have a heart,
Then what's this I feel inside?

Why can't she love me?
I gave her my heart.
Does it really matter?
To me, it's everything.
I'll never forget her.
And now I must part,
A wiser man, but sadder,
As this last song I sing.

Why can't she love me?
It's such an easy thing to do.
I just can't understand it,
When I love her so.
Why can't she love me?
When her love is all I need.
But I can't demand it,
I must let her go.

Did I find a heart
Just to give it away?
Did I think that she would care?
I can only hope I find
A place in her heart, somewhere.</center>

This is the song the dollmaker sings when he discoveres the doll laying in the ditch.
<center>
My boy! My boy!
I'm overcome with joy!
I knew that I would find you once again!

Come back with me,
Together we will be,
Away from this awful world of sin!

My son, My son,
But still it must be done,
You still have an important role to play.

Now I must part,
But knowing in my heart,
We'll be together for eternity some day.</center>

""Here"" is the song the doll sings when he discoveres he has been betrayed.

<center><b>Here</b>
Do I belong here?
From all I've seen 
it seems there's something wrong here.
Love tends to die
before it has begun here.
There is no sun here
The sky is gray.

I must stay strong here
I must keep my faith 
and hope will bring a song here.
For I know deep in my heart
I don't belong here
And yet I pray:

""Will i find a life here?
A purpose to exist in all the strife here?
Is there someone who can find love in my heart here?
A new start here?
A reason to stay?""

I will wait here.
Though I know that there is so much hate here.
Love always seems to come a little late here.
But in time I know there will be something great here.
And I will wait here,
Until I find a way.
Until I find love,
Someday.</center>

This is the song the girl sings after he dies.

<center><b>Had I Only Known</b>
Had I only known,
There would be this much sorrow.
I'd open my eyes,
And you'd be gone tomorrow.

I wouldn't be ashamed
To return the love you've shown.
I would never, never let you go.
Had I only known.

You were so innocent
Giving unselfishly
Never asking in return
The love you gave to me.

Had I only known
The way that we would part.
Holding you in my arms,
Now I can only hold you in my heart.

Had I just one wish,
One dream to call my own
I would give you all my heart, my love
Had I only known.</center>

Here are other bits and pieces of songs that never really got too far.
<center>
The mind is not where love lies,
Please do realize.
True love is found within the heart,
For there, it never dies.


Let love live,
for it can make me stronger
Let love last
In my heart a little longer
I can feel it begin to fade away
let love stay
if only, for one more day.

I am getting older
Time goes by so fast
But until the day I hold her
Let love last.


When love was new
The only thing in my life was you
The only thing in my heart was you
The lonely days were few
When love was young
The happiness in our hearts took wing
Our happiness could overcome anything
Our song was yet sung
When love was true.


A heart is broken
A dream, awoken.
A bitter ending to this fairy-tale
A vivid image, which has grown pale.
Reality can be quite sad,
When a dream is all you had.</center>"

"event","Wow. I just finished watching <i><b>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</b></i> for the first time, and that's the first thing that comes to mind.  I had been anticipating it ever since I saw its trailer on the internet last year, but for various reasons never saw it in the theater. So earlier today I bought the DVD at Wal-Mart. I usually never do that, buy a DVD I've never seen before, but this time I made an exception because I had a feeling I would like it. Liking it is too mild a term however. Easily the best film out this year, and the best I've seen in a long time. Great cinematography, great fight sequences, great musical score. Everything was so fluid and graceful, it's like a dance. It's not even in english, but it's hardly noticeable. Now I only regret passing it up for <i><b>Hannibal</b></i> when I had the chance to see it at the theater."

by Jeremy Bone
1993

There was a time
I was alone
No one to hold me
To call my own

My world was dark
Blinded by gray
Searching hopelessly
In yesterday

Then came a day
You came to me
You opened my eyes
And taught me to see

Sweetly you sang
A song so dear
And I had love then
When you were here

But time moves on
And so have you
And love it now seems
Has left me too

There was a time
So long ago
I loved her once
But never let her know

There was a day
When I could say
Love would always be here
In my heart to stay

Time it goes by
And there is doubt
A heart is uncertain
And love it goes out

Where is always
Where is sincere
Where is forever
I can't find it here."

"event","Hehe, here's something funny I stumbled across amongst some of these old papers. I wrote this poem a looong time ago, I think in elementary school. At the time I had this isty-bitsy toothpick of a girlfriend named Leah. Valentine's day was coming up and I asked my mom if she would buy me something for Leah. But she thought I was too young to have a girlfriend then, so she told me I should just write her a poem. ""She'll appreciate you more because that's more special than buying something,"" she said. So I believed her and wrote the following:
<center>
Money can't buy happiness
Its cliche, but yet its true
Still if I were a richer man,
I would spend it all on you.

Maybe diamonds are a girls best friend
And yet they couldn't start
To compare with the gift I send,
The love that's in my heart.

The light in those gems will die
Wealth will be gone some day
But the love between you and I
Will never fade away.

I wish I could give you more
Than just these words of mine
But if a thousand jewels you wore,
No brighter would you shine.

Still I searched the world around,
The most precious gift to find.
Then realized I had already found her,
Leah, my Valentine.
</center>
Then I made a card out of construction paper and put the poem in it. I think she broke up with me the next day."

I'm really getting restless around this place waiting to start work. I talked to my manager on the phone and she said that a few people I would be working with are around my age, so hopefully they will be cool. Well, since I have nothing better to do, here's a little more Pulitzer prize worthy prose of mine from the Mrs. Jones file. I actually only got a 90 on this one because I guess somehow she was able to tell I hadn't actually read the poem ""Sentiment"" that we were suppose to be critiquing. I was able to tell that because at the top of the paper she wrote ""It might help if you read it next time."" Pfft, I never read anything in highschool.

<blockquote>
<b>My Sentiments on ""Sentiment""</b>

It is talking about how short life is but how important everything is to an individual if not to anyone else. It explains how eventually everything will come to an end and how many things go unnoticed to many people except the ones involved. I feel that for some reason the man who wrote this poem was thinking about committing suicide because he feels guilty that it was his fault that his friend was in an accident on the way to his son's soccer game, but he wasn't hurt and so he took his friend to the hospital which made him late for the game, and then when he got home he found that a tree had fallen on his house so he had to move to Alaska with his great uncle, and then his great grandnephew fell off a mountain snowskiing, and he blamed it all on himself and he wanted to blow up the world because he was a devil worshipper, but he didn't know how, so he decided to jump in a river instead, but the one he jumped in dried up before he drowned and Lassie found him and took him back to his house, so he decided to raise animals and teach them how to speak instead of sacrifice them to satan but it didn't work and he went crazy because he couldn't die so he wrote this poem."

"event","<b>Mr Midget Man</b>
<i>Words and music (c) 1999 Jeremy Bone</i>

I met a midget one night
I threw him around
like everyone else
and I laughed
like everyone else
but he didn't mind
because he was drunk
and made good money besides.

He smiled as he flew through the air
happy it seemed as he downed another
we handed a big wad to his brother
and he disappeared to who knows where.

Hey, Mister Midget Man,
what's your story,
do you have a plan?
Would you pay any cost
to be in my shoes
not to know you had lost
before you had a chance to lose?

We ran into him at a bar
We stood him up and parked the car
I dusted him off and apologized
he looked me in the eyes and said
I'm used to being knocked down
but it's not that far to the ground
and laughed but behind the smile
I could see a frown, as he sang...

Yeah I run
As fast as I can
And I fly
So high like Superman
but in this big human race
it's hard for these legs to keep the pace
So we go underground
and we feel safe and sound
from this big world, and its big people
and their big heads.

Hey, Mister Midget Man,
come on out from under ground
we don't care that you're half as tall
we stare because we hardly see you at all
sure we look down at you
but we're not looking down on you.

Hey, Mister Midget Man,
come on out from under ground
and if you fall,
just remember this,
your view's not that much different
after all."

"event","Whew, I'm finally moved in to my new place in Longmont, Colorado. The apartment is really nice, but then again it <i>should</i> be for as expensive as it is. My parents bought me a new bed, chest, kitchen table, and coffee table. The mattress is one of those Simmons Beautyrest where you don't feel it if someone else happens to fall into the bed from a couple stories up. Of course the only one jumping into it is me, but it's still fun. IBM pushed my start date back another week for some reason or another, which is kinda both good and bad.. good in that I have a little longer to do nothing before I start working for the rest of my life, bad in that I'm already starting to get bored here by myself, and I'm not the kind to just make friends with everyone I meet on the street. While unpacking I came across some old papers, songs, poems, etc, I wrote at various times in the past. If I get bored I might post some of the more <i>interesting</i> ones. 

Want to hear some pretty wacky prank phone calls? Check out <a href=""http://www.blackout.com"" target=""_new"">blackout's box</a>. I recommend the ""Quan Chronicles."" It's around 30 minutes long just to warn you, but it's worth it. The guy definitely has some talent, and maybe a little too much time on his hands as well.

Well, I'm dialing in long distance to my parent's ISP to check my email and type this, so I'd better go for now. I promise to read everyone's journals when I get a permanent connection again."

"event","Hey peeps! 

Mom, Ashley and myself drove down to Ore City, TX this past wednesday to be with my grandpa during his surgery. It seems to have gone well and the doc said that they thought they were able to cut out all the cancer. I sure hope so.  My 14 yr old cousin Jamie was down there too spending the summer with our grandparents. She said she was going to go with us on the trip to Colorado. My uncle Scott brought over my newest cousin, Marissa, who I got to see for the first time. She's a cutey! I took my digital camera along but forgot about it until right before we left on friday so I whipped it out and snapped a few pics. You can check them out... <a href=""http://www.digitalfridge.com/dfPerInvite.asp?iDFICode=24634450"" target=""_new"">h e r e</a>. Jamie's brother, Josh, who's gonna be a senior in HS next year, IM'd me a few hours ago and said he's also gonna go with us to CO, so it looks like we're gonna have a nice caravan heading out west. People just can't let me go! :)

<b>Definite sign of me getting older/going senile:</b> my parents said that I could either get a new computer or a bed and furniture for my new apartment as a graduation gift... I chose the latter. Slap, slap. But it <i>is</i> justifiable since my futon was about to fall apart and my other furniture was either a) extracted from dumpsters, b) bought for 50 cents at a yard sale, or c) bought for not much more at wal-mart fall-a-part. My poor computer has a serious need for an upgrade too, but I'm crossing my fingers that my new employer might give me one or at least give me a discount on one.

<b>Strange occurrence:</b>if you look back not too far in my journal you'll see a random thought I wrote about time, that has ""tic, tic, tic"" in it. I was watching the boob-tube just the other day and a commercial came on with a man saying ""tic, tic, tic"" and some line about the importance of time in applications, ""tic, tic, tic"" blah, blah, really similar to what I wrote. The kicker? The commercial was for none other than guess who... IBM! Needless to say I was freaked out for a little while! Actually, I still am. Hmmm, I wonder..."

"event","It's been fun being absolutely worthless the last couple of weeks. My days generally consist of a rotation of the following: computer, piano, tv, book, eat, nap, swim, exercise. I actually did help dad build a flower bed for mom which I'm proud of. Dad put up a small electric fence thingy around another flower bed because the outside dogs were digging in it and it's been fun seeing how long I can hold on to it without passing out. After that wore out I tried to trick some of the dogs into touching it but mom caught me so that was the end of that. As you can tell I've been pretty bored. I've started reading these Left Behind books about the end times predicted in the Bible and so far they are really good. I've always been fascinated by the book of Revelation and end times research so these are right up my alley. I would have started them a lot earlier but I've been reading the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan which are HUGE books and between work and class have taken me a couple years to wade through. That's fine though since now I don't have to wait around for the release of another book because a lot of them are out already. 

I got tired of scanning pictures after a while because it takes forever to scan one not to mention upload them all on this measley analog modem connection. However, the graduation pics from my mom's camera came in and I've scanned some of those... :: <a href=""http://www.digitalfridge.com/dfPerInvite.asp?iDFICode=24189390"" target=""_new"">graduation</a> :: Nothing special, just a bunch of shots of me sweating like a 10 year old Malaysian kid in a Nike factory wearing the obligatory stupid black hat and robe in 100 degree heat.

My grandfather (who appears in some of those graduation pictures) is going into the hospital this week for more skin cancer treatment. They determined that it is malignant. I could tell at graduation that he had gotten a lot weaker than since the last time I saw him. He's the hardest working man I've ever known, and it's hard to accept that he might not be here much longer. He and Mimi are coming with me along with mom on my trip to Colorado which I'm really thankful for because it will give me a chance to spend some quality time with him one more time. Also my sister Ashley is going in for more surgery for her endometriosis in a few more weeks. I really feel for her because I know that must be difficult to deal with. I'm sure they would both appreciate your prayers.

Well I'm off to Sleepyland. I'm trying to get in the habit of getting in bed by midnight because I know I'll have to start getting up early to go to work every day when it starts. So far I haven't been that successful."

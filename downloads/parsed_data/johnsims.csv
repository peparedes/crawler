Forgery of a love that disappeared
Into the depths of the ocean, insincere
I never knew what it was like to be alone
But now I'm alone with you (alone with you).

So much for my defeatist attitude
You beat me to the sucker-punch, my dear
So much for drinking and dancing the night away
At least I have the alcohol, anyway.

Promises of the life everyone should have
Happy and full, our cups never empty and
You said ""don't worry, I'll never leave you,""
Words disguise the fact that you're tired of me.

So much for love -
So much for cheesy horror flicks.
So much for heart-shaped flasks.
So much for us, I never asked
To be the one you said you loved.
So much for you and I."

Getting out has never looked so good

<br>
Quit being happy with you (like I should)
<br>
I gotta get up &amp; get out &amp; get on my feet again!

<br>
<br>
There's one way out
<br>
I know without a doubt
<br>
That I cannot stay.

I can see that

I won't miss you

More or less than words can say.<br>

It lies within
Under the surface
Pretext to a life that's less than perfect.

Haunting me
With the eyes
Of a thousand chosen travelers.

It must be a
Tragedy
To think that none of them may make it to the...

Other side of the wishing well
Trapped for life in this living hell
There's no one to open this tiny cell
There's no way out!

Oh, I wish I could wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish I could wish you well.
I wish you well."

She says
I'm really trying to quit
I've cut down
Don't do as much anymore.
She says
I've got alot of self control
Help me
Help me make it through...

Tonight, the stars are all out
But my favorite one is her.
There's a million different spots of light
But she shines them all out.

She says
Let's go for a spin
Head east
Never looking back again.
She says
I wonder if I'll ever miss
That life
Like it never even did exist.

There's a million different spots of light

We're not another political band
We just want what's right and fair

Tear down a country that we didn't create!

We cannot breed this love of death
We cannot breed ignorance and greed
Give the world to the few free thinkers

Go away from me right now
As I slip further from my own sight
Tonight was supposed to be special
But you made it just another night
Void of all feeling and bleeding and life.

My heart was yours to have and to own
But that just wouldn't be enough for you
I give you credit on your taste
My heart would not beat for so precious few
Moments of feeling and fleeting teen angst.

I shouldn't be so broken and bruised
At the thought of seeing myself lose
Why can't I grow up, learn love is a lie
And slip into the depths of a life
Where all I have are fallacies.

You'd rather be anywhere than being with me
And I'm counting the minutes til you ask me to
  leave.
You'd rather be anywhere than being with me
And I'm counting the minutes til you tell me I

Taking me back to when we were innocent
Feelings more pure and hearts on fire
We were the chosen ones
The youth who would bring the world together
Ignorant happiness and flighty arrogance
Our problems engulfed by overwhelming abundance
The whites of our souls bleached
Washed clean by the sins of our parents
The ones who truly sacrifice themselves daily
So that we can grow to bear the children
Keepers of tomorrow who will conquer all
And feel the same damned childhood
Wide-eyed and unready to face what life is
The fleeting hopes unraveling day by day
Not knowing the actions occurring around them
Metaphors brought down from the heavens
To a child who is unsure of what it means
But it is encouragement and support that helps
All the metaphors in the world cannot help
The soothing voices assuaging their fears
And all we have in the end really is love
The love we pass down through our generations."

Ambiguous feelings uniting
A broken country,
Incurable liars turn the
Fingers on their own people.
The political machine using
War for popularity,
But when it's settled
Who's on their side?

Avoiding accusations with
More displacement of the problems,
Terrorism is in the eye of the beholder
Or whoever holds the highest office.
So when it's time to cast your ballot
Make sure they buy your vote,
After all, they can afford it
You pay their salaries anyway.

Fighting for unjustifiable causes
Let's increase the budget for defense,
Leave the people on the street where they are
If they want food, they'll have to enlist.

Even time doesn't have the power to halt it,
Every day I cringe to hear the news
And learn which freedom we lost this time."

When all is said,
And you are dead,
Did you ever live,
In life?

The principles of thought,
The meaning of a heart,
When all is lost,
Can you find the way?

I hope you have freedom,
The spectacle of choice,
Our country can't provide
Equality.

Sickness plagues the land,
Yet is stopped by just one hand,
Ignorance is dropped,
But it's too late.

Too much lament falls on those,
Who cannot choose, but rightly chose,
To hate and never learned,
To tolerate.

For once I wish it all to end,
This disease of mind among all men,
And prosperity to replace the,
Insecurities within."

"event","""<b>Let Me Flee</b>""
By: John Sims

Fickle incantations of hope
Underlying thoughts of why I can't overcome
Fleeting dreams are all I have
Lost in a sea of possibilites.
You're the reason I go on,
Sick of pleasing you, I run.

No escape, from your eyes.
They burn a gaping hole in my chest.
You steal my heart and conquer me.
Why can't you just let me flee?

No more pestilence to inflict
I'm just an effigy to your sad inclinations
Evading traps to change my mind
Your gimmick won't win a place in my heart.
You're the reason I can't win,
I fear the wolf that's entered my den.

No escape, from your lies.
They burn a gaping hole in my chest.
You steal my mind and conquer me.
Why can't you just let me flee?

Subtle venoms you slip for me
Apothecary for my mind, you become
Indecisive if I should live or die
I cannot live this kind of life.
You're the reason I am weak,
Timid, shy, hidden, and meek.

No escape, from your cries.
The burn a gaping hole in my ears.
You steal my love and conquer me.
Why can't you just let me flee?"

The lies that you polish,
The pain that is given

Speak with a front.

My head is reeling from the sensory images,
The pictures feeding into my skull like bullets,
Rippling through flesh and gray matter,
Injecting my mind with new disillusions of thought.

Here my physical self decays with jealousy,
The feelings of self-betrayal of foreknowledge,
Knowing you lay with him under the fully lit moonroof,
I locked these nightmares inside of my own asylum walls.

All I need is a bitter desperation,
Separation from the feeling of fright,
Dying alone every night,
I live my life in soured resignation; exasperation.

I will always let stray thoughts linger into how I am a failure,
How I could never accomplish the goals that I never bother to set,
Yet always seem to come so close to attaining,
Yet falling just short of the line you set up and drew for me.

All I need is a bitter desperation,
Separation from the feeling of fright,
Dying alone every night,
I live my life in soured resignation; exasperation."

The birds are envious,
Wishing they could fly as me,
Living life dangerously.

Down to the Earth,
I fall lifelessly, limp,
My senses dull quietly,
The pavement is soft.

Downward to the core,
The center of Earth,
Regaining composure,
I run to the door.

Upward my hand goes,
Reaching for the knob,
The hand is successful,
But the door, it is locked.

Filling up my mouth, I drown.

Work fulfilled with despair.
The sun dies in the sky,
Leaving the new moon's glow.

Celestial lovers meet,
Blowing kisses of shooting stars.
Indebted to the galaxy,
Our ill-fated couple pass.

Alone, but happy still.

 By: John Sims

Airy, mysterious, wiry figure,
Teach me the err of my ways.
I've bowed here in worship,
Amazed and dumbfounded,
Never quite so disarrayed.

My mind here a blank,
It begs to be filled.
Never before have I marvelled,
Wondered at such a thing,
My eyes surely deceive tonight.

Hardy and untouched by negativity,
My love here obeys by my whims.
Flowered and fertilized,
Emotions inside of myself blossom,
Into a staircase that leads to the heart.

My lonliness reaches inside of me,
Yet cannot seem to make me hollow.
The sound of my own voice,
Soft and restrained in my room,
Echoes quietly inside of my ears.

The happiness I cannot reach,
Cannot escape, corrupts my face.
The expression on my lips,
Confusion and uncertainty aside,
Curls into complacency."

All I feel is a sense of fault
A ping of jealousy that leads to pain
A breath of compassion feelings can't halt
Your loss is my gain.

Comprehension knocks on my mind
My thoughts abandoned, later unjoined
Oblivion ahead, utopia destroyed
Selfishness adopted, the hurting rejoined.

You left me shattered
In pieces of obsidian
My life is nothing but
A wrecked monument.

I let my agony freeze inside me
Like moments of the past we had
My bloody chest is still aching
But further on I can't see my future.

You left me shattered
In pieces of obsidian
My life is nothing but
A wretched monument
Of a forgotten time
A forgotten romance
My heart still lies
My mind gives up and dies.

Shockwaves spent recussitating my thoughts
Like a cataclysmic fall from an invisible cliff
Ideas still linger causing unstoppable danger
Our worlds connect and we disjoin ourselves.

You left me shattered
In pieces of obsidian
My life is nothing but

You left me broken
In pieces of obsidian

Constant abuse enslaving,
Prints in my mind engraving,
Their words; they are always degrading.

Harsher words could not be found,
My feelings hurt, I am endlessly drowned,
To a world that revolves around penetrating sound.

Coping is always the problem.
When I'm pressured I can't always pursue,
The dream of accomplishing the truth.
Why must I always believe them?

Floods of emotion, always my downfall,
Mentally unstable for a proverbial long haul,
I cannot break down, I cannot uninstall.

Imperfectly flawed in their minds,
One cannot read through the lines,
When all of it leads to no signs.

Cancerous intentional demise,
Sifting through loads of pseudo-false lies,
Feeling the nonsense of hope in my eyes.

I still can't feel.
The absent thrill.
The silent chill.
That makes me still.
And still my will.
Amounts to nil."

How could you use it
To lie and to hurt me?
I can't sit here
And take my own thoughts
Mocking myself
Hoping life rots
You fed me your lines
Led me to believe you

I can't believe how I never knew
My mind betraying my senses
I should've just known
How can I be hurt so much
And still haven't grown.
Frustration still biting
And clawing at the neck
Of all that is innocent in my
Own retrospect
I haven't been pure
By no means am I perfect
I cannot permit you to
Cause me more defect

You are not
The one I know
The one I know
You are not

I hate being there, but then again here is the same.
Nothing to do, no one to talk to.

Even my happy moments can't make up.
For in all, my mood is melancholy and unstable.
I can't handle the things you throw my way.

I overlook the most simple aspects of friendship.

I have no control over my own thoughts.

You think I should.
Others think I should.
They say I shouldn't.

They betray themselves in their mind as well.
They want me to give up, to give in.
Inside I want myself to go on, to conquer.
I don't know if I have the power to do this.
I hate being your used goods.
I hate being your garbage.  Your trash.
You love yourself and only yourself.
In all, can we do anymore?
I can't begin to love you if I don't love myself.

I can't drown out my misery with apathy.
I can't be narcissistic if I can't love myself.
I can't love myself if I don't know what love means.
I can't know what love means if you keep hurting me.
I love everyone, all the time, but I don't know what it is.
I feel something for you, whether it be good or bad.
I can't be non-biased.
Life doesn't work on lack of emotion.
I've tried to be emotionless and it left me even more dead.
Dead from grief of overbearing feelings.
I hate life, yet I love everything in it.
I hate the way I contradict myself, but it makes so much sense.
Please don't stop treating me the way you do.
I'd be confused if I wasn't your trash.

And our hearts were fixed as one;
No one could separate us,
There was no need to say a word.

What is it that makes the sonnet that is my love spring to life?
What is it that makes me think of houses, children, and a wife?
Spring love has yet to bloom, the frosty chill of winter warms;
Under blankets, wrapped tight in one another's sweet, embracing arms.

What is it that breaks my heart each time we have to part?
What is it that my eyes can say what my mouth can't even start?
Oft times, I wish I could sit and listen to the rain, at your side;
My love, I say, is true to you, in this I do confide.

My dear, my dear, I shant want to part, though sacrifice is paid;
Thought we cannot be every minute together, our love shall not be weighed;
For I love you, whether rain or shine, whether prospered or destitute;
My heart, for you, my very soul, shall I always attribute.

Do not fear, my one, I shall not stray, for you I will true stay;
For you, dearest love, have the love to get me through my days."

"event","""<b>Friday Rain</b>""
by: <b>John Sims</b>

I left my home today
In search of better things
The man I am inside
Couldn't handle all the pain.
Don't you know I didn't mean
To say those spiteful things?
I hate myself sometimes
I hate you even less.
The angry words exchanged
Were lain to rest
With bitter pain.
The storm that started long ago
Has been replaced
With Friday Rain."

"event","""<b>Heart That Fell</b>""
by: <b>John Sims</b>

Dislocated
Allocated
Consecrated
Heart

Perpetrated
Infiltrated
Emancipated
Heart

Give my life to just a thief
Reap the pleasures of newfound love
Torn by strife that comes with learning
My feelings betrayed by one simple yearning

Dislocated
Allocated
Consecrated
Heart

Perpetrated
Infiltrated
Emancipated
Heart

Blessed emotion drives me forward
Another new love, another steep drop
Much like the rain falling gently outside
My pain it wells up, it's my tears that I hide.

Dislocated
Allocated
Consecrated
Heart

Perpetrated
Infiltrated
Emancipated
Heart

Dislocation of my heart
Allocation of my emotions
Consecration of my love
Perpetration of my weakness
Infiltration of my feelings
Emancipation of my freedom.

My.. heart.. falls."

"event","I spent today in a furniture workshop, learning how to build wooden things. Specifically a table with a nice German woman named Peggy.
Who then promptly broke her finger, and won't be back til next week.
Well...
Fuckshit.

3 days to go in a workshop with an adorable German man who speaks little English and a Bolivian who speaks German and really doesn't like it when I watch him work.
Next week I FINALLY start work with Bernt, and will be restoring an old hunter's lodge.

November 9th I fly to Bristol to see one of my most favoritest people evar and his brother (who is not so bad either.). Both went to my high school and have some crazy memories with them.
Can't wait.
December 14th I'm outta here, and back home in time for my Birthday and Christmas.
Might come back, but its lookin' like I'll stay home and get ready for grad school.
I'm thinkin' I'll become a fuckin' librarian.
yes? oh hell yes."

Life is Strange.
And people ask me why I smoke so much pot. Actually they don't. In fact most of the people around me now a days smoke more pot than myself, and that is alot of bud my friends. That is a fuckton of money going into our throats.

If I rip my mind from my own fleshsack, and look at everyone else while they play out their day-to-day lives, it all seems so fucking silly. 

To sound like a pretentious douche-- the behavior, rituals and codes of presentation/representation we get so wrapped up in is so weird to watch. Everybody just looks like an animal trying so hard not to be one.

I don't know. My freshman year I took a survey Anthro course, I even was an Anthro major. My first writing assignment was to go to something familiar and observe as if none of it was familiar. I did well, and I thought I had a grasp of it. But now I really get it. Its so strange.

I recently have been so jaded socially that I feel like I'm watching everything happen while not even being there. I see the weirdest details in the way people appear to present themselves and interact. We are just so silly. Silly in every sense of the word.

I'm still the worst procrastinator known to all of Massachusetts though. Oh-ho yeah."

On January 3rd I'm getting it. with the number 3653 to mark 10 years since my father's death. More than half my life.

Then in the middle of my back from flower to flower [but more on the lower back] I'm getting a portrait of Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction and change. 

The last thing on my back will be a Tibetan text of the prayer for death and life over the lotus.

at least it's not boring?

That seems to be my excuse for alot of things these days. Haha, I wonder if that is a bad thing.
I managed to fall [drunk] at some point last night right on my right eyelid. So, there is a strangely formed bruise that looks like very intense eyeshadow.
haha

My friend bobbie weed told me that obviously, this is god's punishment for for hooking up with the person I am currently interested in.
Everyone, for the most part, has told me to stay away from him, with the exception of some gay friends of mine who seem to share my strange interest in the man. We have yet to really come up with any sort of explanation to why he is so attractive..Besides him being a complete snarling asshat with no filter when talking socially. Dear god, the inventory of dead baby, women-hating, racist, just vile jokes in that brain.

Ah, well, so it goes.
I feel mentally at odds alot, but, for some strange new reason, I am able to handle things. Calmly even. Slowly, my paranoia for social interactions is withering away. I guess this comes with practice, as I spend alot of my time actually talking to people and not obsessing over whether I'm going to get rejected or not. My brain is a silly thing.

I hate my dorm. I rarely spend time here, except to sleep. My friend Drew is sleeping on my floor for awhile, which adds more to the organized chaos, including smelly boy clothes. Actually it ticked me off today cause apparently my door wasn't shut all the way yesterday, and the girl across the hall [the only person I really talk to on my floor] closed it and left me a note saying how messy my room was and how it smelled bad. wtf lady, not your business. But Drew left his clean wet clothes on my fucking floor, and that smell mixing with my ""ember"" scent diffuser..well it is an odd combination.

Aaanywho, in the meantime, I'm going to head back to my surrogate dorm of leech, take more ritalin, talk to people, and happily re listen to every song wumpscut has put out. ahhh creepy industrial. mm."

today was a day of numerous revelations. including that i am alright. the shattered pieces of my heart have reformed, into something stronger it feels. Atleast something wiser. Maybe alittle more weary, but nonetheless better off.

I feel strong. sort of. At least, like my feet aren't sliding as much as I frantically try to brace myself against attack.

But I also realized, this town, this home, -- I've completely outgrown it.

There will always be the small comforts of home, of my mother (despite her being batshitcrazy), of my friends, for they are ""home"" in all sentiments of the word. 

But I feel like, hmm, like I am actually ready to move on. To grow. To go back to UMASS and fucking live again. With abit more restrain perhaps, but also more confidence. Mind you, this epiphany will surely crumble back into despair. But I can take it. Despair for me is like another end of a revolution. Then I start again. 

Let me end this oh-so endearing enlightenment post by saying my lips are in a smile. Fuck what they all think. Fuck what they all do. I found somewhere to go with my life, with myself, and no one, no matter how selfish, how much of a letdown, can take me down their little hole of despair. I have enough of my own, there is no room for anymore. Its my turn to snap and bite back. Its my goddamned time to feel lovely and beautiful and strong. I can take it all. Bring it on."

In fact she seemed to restore my faith in the human race for the evening.<br /><br />I cannot remember the last time I met someone who <i>just being around inspires me to want to be a better person.</i><br /><br />It was short-lived but wonderfully sweet. I have never been more platonically in love with someone. haha.<br /><br />Yes, this surprised me too."

i need a smoke.
i cant have one.
today i have to go on a picnic with my mother and cousin. and see an opera.. sitting in the heat.
with no cigarettes.
fuck fuck fuck fuck.

maybe i should take her up on her threat: if you are going to be cranky don't come.

see that is a trick though. If I do say, hey i am cranky, I would like to spare you from it by staying home so we don't get into fights, she takes it as hey im purposely trying to piss you off cause i hate you and dont want to be around you fuck off.

which means she'll be even more mad at me.

I killed alot of people and dogs in that dream. With a knife. And then Max picked me up and we ate cookies in his car.

And Valerie was a gothic school teacher with blue dreads.

"event","I've never ever ever felt so uncomfortable in ANY situation than today. I don't know how many of you have had to have a crown drilled and sanded off so they can put on a new one.
But.
Take the sound of ... let's see...
A power sander. Knock the frequency up to that ringing noise you get after you're at a particularly loud club or rock concert. The kind where you can't hear properly for a couple of hourse afterwards? Take those noises, add them together, multiply the intensity by 5, and then stick it in the middle of your brain. The very center. Oh, and also add the sensation of tickticktickticktiktikitktitititit on your front left tooth. With completely numb lips, mouth, gums, tongue and nose. Then take a piece of metal, heat it up, and poke the little nub of tooth you have left to shape it. It's hot. And all you can smell is burning bone. There was my blood on my dentist's rubbered hands, in my face. They had to give me more novacaine 'cause it hurt so much.

I started crying. It really was insane, I've never ever had that happen before. So, yanno, 4 hours later my lips and gums are still numb. 
I also have a not so stable temporary crown which has to stay til the 9th of july without flying out, and fucking christ missed work today, 'cause I mostly just answer the phones, and I can barely smile properly, let alone speak.

So today sucks. Now I'm sitting in my dark little room, have been for like 2 hours. I finally watched the last episode of House, amazing. I cried. And then found the giant crate-box of bottles of my mother's Shiraz. Nursing a bottle currently.

Oh, yes, and I've discovered that it is way too easy to slip back into diet mode. It's nice. I've already lost 3 or 4 pounds this week. Word.

And last night I had a dream about swimming with lemurs. Lemurs with dollheads that looked like Shirley Temple. 

What the hell?"

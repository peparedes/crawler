"event","I'm an assfart.  I might have messed up the one thing I care about and I feel shitty. I lied. I don't know why...I guess I just push things to the back on my mind and leave them there. I think it was mostly about fear of losing her. Now I can't be trusted and that sucks. The problem is also now it makes her think I don't care about her. Or that I would leave her or cheat on her. Which I know I wont but now theres no point of saying anything. Once someone doesnt believe you then they wont believe anything. I know that I care. I know I never wanted to hurt her. And I know I would do anything for her. I think If I was an outsider I'd say ""leave him"" just like I know everyone is saying now. I actually would expect to be left anyway. I think I will be anyway. And I feel bad more for what I did to her. As much as I don't want to lose her I would in exchange for her to not hurt...but that wouldn't happen anyway. I know that I just fucked her up. Now everything seems fake to her. But beyond the lie/lies that all lead off each other it is. At least for her everyone likes her and she'll find love again if she decides to move on. For me I don't care if anyone wants me or cares about really. I'm happy where I was for the only time in my life. The moral of the story is that one lie can never stay one lie. 

I'm really mad at myself and I expect to just lose everything because I really deserve to. Right now it's too late to change anything. It just comes down to wheather she still wants to be my friend or not. And I guess for her that comes down to wheather we knows that I care and am a good person or not. /trust. I don't know if I would trust someone if I was to trade places. I think I would. But I'm also a very different person then her. She has done everything perfect from our long friendship to our relationship. Where I was an ass sometimes she has done nothing but been great to me. I guess I just have my own problems. She's really a cute girl. I think I would miss when she talks cute. It's hard to explain. That and cute faces and hugs. And just the way that we have endless convos with never a boring or empty second. We actually went from never shutting up in one day to bearly talking. Our little world just broke open. 

Yesterday I spent all my time thinking of things that we did together...going to montalk, trip to Fl. on the train, driving to taco bell to get late night snacks. Going to the Wingate and acting like kids. I was such an ass there. I was turing 21 in a week and I was so so happy when they didn't I.D. us...until I realized I was an adult. It's funny how time can just pass by. I don't want to be Mike pre Jess again. That would suck. I have changed so much and have become so happy. Things would be impossible to enjoy. I get bored playing video games...playing music. everything when shes not there. I hope that I was really good to her. I tryed so hard and enjoyed making her happy and doing anything I could think of that day to make her smile. Or have fun. I don't like to see her upset at all ...makes me sad :( .Knowone knows how good she was to me...at all. I feel like she's one of the only good people I ever met...actually the best. And I don't just say that. She really is the nicest person and she always gets screwed over. It's not fair at all. No one is as good to her as she is to them. I guess some people just get delt a bad hand. I have been but I was never anywheres near as nice to people. 

For the record if we don't work through this. It's my fault. %100. I don't want anyone to think badly of her. She's a really good person. And has gotten a bad rap especially from one kid. 

I would like to get through this. And I'll be devistated not to stay friends. But I might not deserve such a good friend. I like to think I'm a good person and have a good heart. But people with good hearts can do wrong. but it's not right. 

i'll write more later..."

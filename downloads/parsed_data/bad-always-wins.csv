We were talking about whats happened in our past and stuff and while we were broken up was the main subject, the friendly side then the not talking stage then our getting back together...funny thing is what takes most people months, takes us weeks...like when Ross first started talking to me like best friends again i was soo happy, i was upset cuz i had found out he was hanging out with brittany but i soon got over that...I remember that saturday that i found out that he hung out with brittany we had talked for like 2 hours that night and it was just like old times again and i was soo happy but then i remembered we were just friends and he was with her....so that monday rolls around and i find out their officially together...needless to say i was shocked and hurt soo much but the funny thing is that while he was with her he would talk to me more...like the very next day he asked me to go to bretts soccer game but i could only stay for a little while...even though i was only there for maybe half an hour it was amazing...he held my hand and put his arm around me and i was soo happy...anyway thursday rolls around and some stuff happened that made me very happy, and on friday night ross and i hung out...i guess thats when you could say we got back together....all of this happened within one week...see what i mean...anyway i'm soooo happy with him and i'm soo thankful we're back together and honestly its like nothing has changed...so yeah i've said my peace thank you for listening"

Today i had to work till 4 which was alright and then Ross came over and we hung out and listened to music and talked and stuff...it was great and i missed hanging out with him soo much so yeah he went home at about 10 and then i had a huge piece of black forest cake cuz i was starving....i worked hard tonight; ) hehe...so yeah now i'm updating this beast

I came home and talked to Ross which was cool but then i foudn out hes going out with brittany UGH to the infinate power...wow just wow is all i have to say about that...me and hahnna went to the jv game and i guess they won but i had to go to work which blew so much cuz it was sooo sooo sooo slow and my back was killing me and my boss scares me hes like a molester or something but i'm not gunna tell my dad or anyone cuz i need the money and i really dont see him that often....Ugh that dude pisses me off soo much he called me mary and he knows my fucking name is megan and his eyes their so empty and cold and just scary....Oh and i'm fucking breaking out like crazy...thats what i get for working in a grease pit i guess tho

Anyway i came home and took a shower which was nice cuz i was cold and i came up with the cutest outfit tomorrow i'm proud of myself and i painted my nails but i'm neglecting to do my homework...oh well i have tutorial tomorrow so i can take care of it then

Anyway this weekend has been kinda ok so far i guess....uhh last night me hahnna and nick went to go see the forgotten...((dont waste you money wait till it comes out on dvd or something)) but it was a good time we got lost on rte 20 on our way there and probably went a good half an hour out of our way...it was funny....then i came home and got bad news but i'm trying not to think about it so yeah

Then i woke up at 8 this morning and went to king richards fair and that was cool weird but cool i learned a cool chant too...its my subject yeah then we came home and went to the mall which was kinda boring but whatever...then i came home and ate and it was gross so i went up and ""did my homework"" but i was really talking to Ross...that was the best thing i've done this weekend...he makes me so happy and i just wish things could be like they were before ugh i hate how one stupid decision can just change everything i hate change...oh well i guess i just have to be strong and try to pretend everythings alright like i have been i just really really miss him...hes a great guy and no matter what i say i love him to death and always will he means so much to me....

I've also learned more about a certain person and how he truely views me now and honestly it sucks but its not his fault, i'm the one that made him feel that way so i guess i really cant blame anyone...It just really sucks knowing that im the cause of such a catostrophe and drove him to another girl, whom i dont approve of much anyway....no offense to her but he can do much better i know he can....and i'm not including myself in this cuz i'm not very good right now i guess...

Anyway work was cool today it was really slow but me and kim talked and shes really cool....judging people isnt cool either cuz i thought she was mean but once you talk to her shes really nice and cool to talk to...i'm finding alot of people are like that...if you open yourself up a little bit to someone and just talk they turn out to be really cool...I think works really helping me to realize that which is cool cuz i'm like scared of people

Oh yeah i went to the jv game yesterday and we lost but i got chicken fajita pizza ((sounds gross but is pretty good)) and some of the auburn players were pretty cool me and laura talked to one...his name was Ryan...he was cool i should have asked if he ran winter track...we could be friends....anyway i want to go out friday night so if anyone doesnt have plans and wants some give me a call...i wanna go see shaun of the dead and i think i'm guna drag hahnna out with me cuz its boring by myself and we get in trouble together so yeah it'll be fun i guess.....i guess i'lll hit this mofo back tomorrow or something....

Friday i slept over hahnnas house and that was fun..we watched mean girls and made fun of a certain someone (hint:its not a guy)...i dont think i've laughed so much about one thing in ages. Anyway we went running earlier that day and i feel accomplished cuz i ran a good 3/4 of the way up the hill from winslow to the town hall...then we had pizza and it was good

Saturday we woke up and i talked to Ross...not the best conversation i've had and i kinda wished it hadnt happened (my life story at this point. Anyway after that i had to go to work which was ok but it was wicked busy and i burnt myself like 20 times. After work i came home and hahnna was just getting there as i was walking down the hill. So i showered and we got ready to go out with nunzi and zach for the night. After we were ready john showed up at like 5:15. Zach was supposed to show up around the same time but he didnt call till like 6 so we didnt end up going to the movies like we were planning. Instead he came and got us and we went to uncle sams got food went back to his house and just hung out and stuff. It was fun even though we didnt do much. Anyway i got home around 11 and waited for ross to come on but he signed off cuz he hates me...so i went to bed at like 130

Today i woke up at like 1030 and went to the coffee hopp in oxford (its that new little diner place) for breakfast. Its a cute little place and they have really good bagels. After that we went to home depot for insulation for sharons house i dunno it was gay...then we came home and i was tired so i slept till like 3 talked to ross and got depressed. So then i just hung around the house and watched movies till around like 530 when glenn and sam showed up...they were here for about an hour and then jake and harry showed up..after that we went to talk to staci when danielle called and we met her at the high school and then we went and talked to seth and i came home...

I have realized something this weekend and i think its pretty important so i'm gunna share...other people make me feel so much better...Ross makes me feel terrible and i'm glad that i have friends that make me laugh and make me feel like i'm something important..I just dont understand him..he'd rather have a girl that has nothing on me (not trying to sound cocky but people have told me this) than me..we had so much and hes just like dropping me like it was nothing...i know i messed up and i wanna make it right hes the one that doesnt want to be with me and i just dont get it i must be the biggest fool for letting him do this...."

You're no good at lying and I'm no good at comebacks.
But you're so untouchable.

I'm terrible at this, you know.

Don't hold this against me.
I've already said I'm sorry.

And I bet you've got every word I said 
memorized in your head.
And you'll use every one of them, 
and you'll use every one of them against me.

Don't hold this against me.
I've already said I'm sorry.
(Tell all your friends about me)
Don't hold this against me.
I've already said I'm sorry.

I hope you choke on every word you spoke when you were screaming at me.
And realize how many times I've tried, but that's wishful thinking.
All I want is an apology for what you did and how you treated me.
Get me far away, or at least as far as this car will take me.

I hope you choke on every word you spoke when you were screaming at me.

"event","How is it possible for one person to just forget about everything good that they had in a relationship over a stupid mistake? It makes no sense to me...I also dont understand how you can say you love someone but break up with them after they tell you the truth when others tell you not to say anything in the first place and then go after some other chick. It fucking sucks and everything sucks

But i'm better than this i know i am. I'm capable of being the person i once was and i dont need him. But then again my heart and my mind are having a battle in my body its a miracle that i have combusted yet. My heart tells me you love him and you wanna be with him but my head says what the fuck megan your better than this...you dont need a person that makes you feel like crap everyday. They're both right i just have to figure out which one to go with cuz right now i'm so confused. I know i love him or else it wouldnt be like this..it would have been like everyother break up i've had. It woulda been like goodbye talk to you in 6 months or the next time i dont feel like avoiding you. But this time i really miss him. I feel so used tho at the same time. Like so much can change about a person in two weeks NO FUCKING WAY IS THAT POSSIBLE. 

You also cant say you forgive a person without accepting what they've done first. It doesnt mean that what they've done is ok or that you should congradulate them for it, it just means that your wiling to work past it and try to forget about it. 

I was a deep believer in love until all this happened. He ruined love for me. I truely and honestly loved him with all my heart and i never stopped. I just made a stupid mistake and i dont deserve what i've gotten. Him on the other hand, he says he loves me but doesnt wanna be with me and he likes another girl and says that i've change in 2 fucking weeks to reitterate my point THERE IS NO WAY POSSIBLE A PERSON THAT YOU LOVE CAN CHANGE SO MUCH YOU DONT WANNA BE WITH THEM IN JUST 2 WEEKS and then says that we were too serious, which i totally agree with but i mean whatever things can change. 

Like i said i'm a fool for even trying to be with him. I should know better that he doesnt love me like he used to cuz i mean i changed sooo much. Whatever i deserve better than a guy who doesnt wanna be with me cuz of a fucking mistake even tho he tells me he loves me so much and wants to be with me. 

Do you still follow?

People are strange and complicated animals and i think i've found the most complicated of the bunch. He says that if he were in my position he wouldnt have done what i did but i think he would have done the same exact thing and probably would have told me but the same way i told him. And yano what i would understand and be willing to work it out. Well anyway i'm kinda out of stuff to say. If i have more i'll def hit this mofo back

Work totally sucked last night i was so tired and ugh it was just bad. Then i was up till f***ing midnight cuz i couldnt sleep cuz i was just so sad and just thinking about anything. God forbid i get one good nights sleep....i woke up like 5 times and today was picture day. Picture day always blows...

Yeah anyway the whole Ross thing is like just so ahhh like i dont know his deal is anymore. He says he wants to be with me but i dont know if i totally believe hime cuz if he did he would be with me...Hmmm i cant eat anymore which sucks cuz i totally love food but i guess thats what happens when your just so friggen frustrated you wanna gouge your eyes out with a blunt stick...

Ugh i'm just sooo tired and i just wanna go to bed and never leave. I fucking hate this i wish that he would either make up his mind and just let me be, be a fucking man and get back with me or just that we were never so emotionally attached to begin with.

I'm trying to get over it and i think i'm doing fairly well with it but i dont know i just feel so angry with myself...not only did i let him down but i let myself down....i never wanted to do what i did but things happen and i hope he can realize that it was just a mistake and want me back sooner or later cuz i dont know i just cant stand this anymore...i just miss him so much and ugh i just hate being friends...i never understood why anyone would but i know why not...it sucks ass...I just want things the way they were...everything was perfect...he was my everything and i fucked it up..he was my only link to insanity and i lost it....

Anyway school should be an adventure this year...I have Ms. Fiore she thinks non of us have a life because i have like 120 pages to read and a 3 page essay to write this weekend due by tuesday...ugh whatever

I have Mrs. Grimshaw too...not cool...

Whatever I guess I'll just suck it up and not do anything at all anymore...its not like i can anyway

Well I'm out catch ya later"

On the way home I just kept thinking...I dunno how that went but it seemed to go well.  Rest assured I talk to him online when I got home.  He asked what I was doing and I told him talkin' to my friend Kim.  He's like oh are you telling her how you went out with a jerk tonight jokingly...I said yea how'd ya know.  Then told him he was prolly gonna tell his friends he went out with a total bitch and wasn't ever gonna talk to her again.  I got told wrong though!  He's like no I came in and my mom asked me how it went and I told her ""I had a really good time.  It was a first date kinda thing and I'm sure they'll be more.""  I was soooo shocked!  I'm still in shock.  Talk about blow me away.  To top it all off, he said if second date goes just as well as the first, there is no reason not to go on a third and forth and so on.  So we'll just see how things go.  I'm excited I haven't been on a ""real date"" in two years.  

Well that is my update...far and few between I do make them when important things come up.  Hope to hear from you guys soon and take care!"

"event","Okay so mentioned guy Corey in last post...asshole.  He got overly annoying and all I got was a $400 cellphone bill from him calling constantly and text messaging me like no tomorrow.  He got all pissy cuz I didn't answer my cellphone after he blew me off all weekend when he's the one who wanted me to hang out.  I didn't call him either cuz I figured he'd call me if he really wanted to hang out.  He didn't call...so I did my own thing.  So I was at the movies w/ Thom and he called at like 11ish I would have to say and I left my phone in the truck when we picked up alex and next day online he gives me shit for not answering.  He said something and I told him if that's what he wanted to think that's alright with me...he said ""fine, bye"" and that's last I heard from his stupid ass.

"event","Well things the past few days have been crappy.  

About a month ago I started talking to this guy, Corey.  He's really nice, sweet, and cute(to me anyways).  So yea we started hanging out and doing things together.  I really liked him to start with, but it didn't seem as if he was that interested...no big deal though.  So things were fine until the other day...we're on the phone and he's like ""So do you see a future of us together?""  I was like I don't know...because I kind of didn't think he was that interested...so I just blew off my thoughts.  So that went over really shitty.  I mean to start with I made it known I was interested by saying so and he just kinda said he didn't know yet.  I guess I took that as he wasn't interested b/c from what I known when a guy is interested he acts like it?  does something?  Shit I dunno maybe I don't know what guys do anymore.  
So now Corey's highly pissed at me.  I said I didn't want to date anyone right now, and I guess I crushed him.  Then the other day he signs online and IMs me saying:  Why do you play with guys hearts and play head games.  Or something along those lines.  
Well what the hell kind of idea would you get from a guy your interested in when he tells you something like, 'yea talk to my ex today...can't stand her but everytime I talk to her I fall in love with her all over again.'  I guess that would make one think he still has a thing for his ex right???  Yea well thats the impression I got.  
Well last sunday when I hung out with him I'm standing in his room and had picked something up on his dresser and he walks up to me and says 'turn around' and then gives me a kiss on the lips.  Caught me by surprise.  The next day we're watching tv and then he kisses me kisses me.  then two days after that I said I didn't want to date anyone right now and I got shit for it.  He doesn't even want to talk to me anymore and refuses to forgive me b/c I crushed him, broke his heart, played games with his mind, etc & so on.  

Furthermore...why is it that I'm the one who gets crapped on for all this?  When ya hang out with someone for a month and they make no notions of being interested in you after you told them you were interested...why is it when you say you're not interested anymore it's your fault they are crushed/heart broken...what the freak happen to the last month here?  I don't get it.  Now I'm being compared to every other girl who hurt him...I give up!

I may have just lost the nicest guy ever.  And there is nothing I can do about it b/c Corey hates me for everything.  I suck."

"event","So I dunno anymore...I feel like I've been a crappy friend lately.  I apologize furthermore.

So guys lately...started talk to this guy who is nice, we hung out ya know and things were good and I was interested and then I suddenly loss interest.  I dunno why either.  I almost think he's too much like me for things to work.  On top of that I don't think I want to start anything b/c of going to NU next semester and I know I'm goin to have to put more time and energy into my school work and then working and playing with alex ya know and I want to have time for my regular friends too.  Which I suck at right now b/c I haven't seen any of my girlies in a long time.  I don't think I want to date anyone either...I'm so use to being single and enjoying myself that changing that would be weird.  Been single for 2 whole years now.  I don't mind, sure gets a lil'lonely at times but that's what friends are for.  I feel bad cuz I know I prolly hurt this guy, but I don't want things to go farther and get caught up and end up hurting him more.  

Well...Saturday is my birthday.  If you'd like to come out and have a cpl drinks, CALL ME!  All are welcome."

"event","Well I had attempted to do this the other day and then got side tracked and came back and it ALL disappeared.  So I said fuck it and left.  Furthermore, I'm going to attempt this again.  If I am foiled, FUCK IT!  

Mini-recap:  Summer really wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  Sorry to anybody I disrespected and hurt and such else.  

I quit my job at the ice cream stand...I got a new job though to replace it and I enjoy working there.  

Back to School...NCCC unfortunately.  Although I can't say it's bad, because I've come across a few people who I enjoy talking to.  Steph/Athena...""As for being an NCCC Alumni...blah blah blah.""  That's where we tune out and laugh silently.  I wish that woman would shut the hell up...and beyond the girls is Kevin and and and yup that's about it.  He's a different case...sorta a friend prior, but more so now than before.  

And as of late...things are alright I imagine.  Nothing to brag about...or I stand corrected...if anyone can weird a guy out, that'd be me.  Sorry Bill...I'm not good with that sort of stuff and you caught me off guard totally.  I've never really been good with the whole dating aspect of life.  Maybe that's the reason I've been single for so long and don't give two shits.  Granted, it is nice to share time with someone who I deem special like that.  But it never works out how you imagine it will.  I do so believe the last relationship is the one where I gave up on dating.  We'll refer to him as X...things were good, actually better than good they were great.  They continued great for almost 3 months.  Then it all slide down the poop chute.  X started to act odd...so I asked what was up, kept getting 'nothing' so I ignored it a few days and asked again...still 'nothing.'  So my birthday comes, the day after we had plans to go out...went out had a good time or so I thought, because on the way home is when things ended.  X gave me the ""I still have feelings for the ex-gf speech,"" which is when I got out of the car and wanted to never look back again because I felt lied to and crushed times 10.  That night, I would of rather been run over by 10 MAC trucks, slowly forward and back.  From that day on I never wanted anyone to be that close to me again.  I built my brick wall and climbed in before it was too late.  I don't think anything has ever hurt as much as that did...

Fear has been instilled in me after that about the whole relationship/dating scene.  So here I am, almost 2 years later and I'm still flying solo.  I guess I'm trying to break out of this isolation.  But I'm not very good at it.  IE:  Bill.  Leave it to me to ruin things...I'm good at that.  Maybe I just weirded him out a bit...A girl can only hope.  It's been like this with him for the past like 4 years.  When I was interested...he wasn't single.  When he was interested...I wasn't single.  NOW...as far as I believe we are both single...atleast I am b/c it's been almost 2 years.  I would believe that he is, we went out for drinks one night after I got out of work.  Two days later he calls me on his way home thought maybe I'd be home and said he was gonna stop over if I was home.  I wasn't home, but thank god he called b/c I needed an excuse to go home and not feel like I was ditching my other friend who was being a dick.  So I came home and we hung out for a cpl hours...and not once does he ask why I'm not sitting next to him on the couch...but TWICE!  I of all people, have become shy and I couldn't pick my ass up and sit with him.  He came over last tuesday for a lil'bit.  All was good, I got him something neat for his desk at work...well a ""new real job gift.""  He liked it and said he hasn't seen anyone else with one like it.  So that was good.

Enough outta me for now...I've babbled on too much.  

Call me lonely,
Call me insane,
Call me pathetic, 
Just don't call me lame!"

Well Char and I booked a cruise to the Bahamas the week after Easter.  It's gonna be a blast!  =)  

Furthmore...I am looking for a new job.  Somebody please call me!!!  

Tonight at work was gay.  Of course jerkface was there...then left...then of course came back...left and was supposedly coming back agian.  Well when my boss said at like 9:15 when things were done that we could go...I said 'alright' and I walked out the door.  Prior to this though she asked me why I was so quiet...I just said I was ""tired,""  which granted I was/am...yea I'm still up.  But it's like...the tention that flies thru the air at work is so thick...you'd need a chainsaw to cut thru it.  I hate work now.  I'm going to quit.  Tomorrow if I have the guts.  I don't know exactly how to do it yet honestly.  On the way home tonight I was so upset I cried.  Call me a giant baby but if you know the whole story...let me know b/c I don't know what happen.  Oh and I didn't do it.

The last two weeks he's ignored me, tonight at work he continued to ignore me, he acted like an asshole honestly.  Only time he spoke to me, was to ask how to use the adding machine calculator thingy...which I ignored him and went and answered the phone.  Then when the phone was ringing again and I knew it was for me, I said I'd answer it and he stepped right infront of me and answered it...can we say STUPID?  YES!  I was honestly ready to fuckin' whip a scraper at the back of his big dumb head...which def. would of hurt like a bitch.  I'm so fucking annoyed and agitated right now I could blow his head off...and not care.  Honest to god, he could die right now and I wouldn't care.  So ya know something...HIT A GIANT BRICK WALL BUDDY...then maybe you'll get your head out of your ass.

Maybe I wear baggies
And white socks with flip-flops,
Maybe I don't like listening to rave
And I'm not on the social mountaintops,
Maybe I don't care about the things
That make your worlds twirl,
Maybe you look at me and think:
Gee, what a nothing girl.

Maybe I like giving smiles
Which seems to be a sin today,
And maybe I allow my imagination
to sometimes run away,
Maybe you don't understand this
and that's why you cannot see,
if this makes me a nothing girl,
Hey, that's okay with me!

The world makes you believe
Your personality mustn't be detected,
Your face must be picture perfect
And wear clothes just the best, to be accepted.
Maybe I look at you
And feel sorry that you're blind,
Robots you have became,
Yourself you'll never find.

God made you, as well as me, 
This means I am something,
The world is a liar
And if I must be a nothing
For you to see it,
The so be it!

So anyways...yea I'm bummed out.  None of my friends are ever single...nor have they ever been is seems, besides Thom.  But he doesn't count.  I flashed to my 10yr HS reunion today and realized I'll prolly be the only one who isn't married.  God!  I'll be like 35 and never married.  It makes me sad to think about that b/c I don't wanna be 35 and single still.  Who knows anymore...!

So I've been looking online for info. about hypnosis for weightloss.  My boss was telling me about a lady she knows who did it last year and she's lost 30lbs!!!  I was like...OMG if I lost 30lbs I'd be so excited & happy!  I dunno, I'm gonna look more up about it and we'll see.  Prolly costly.  But I'd do it if it really works!"

Well it leaves me at peace ya know that he's alright.  Cuz I kept thinking of calling him or sending him a letter and I just couldn't...b/c I didn't know what to say/write.

So I called Joey-Bear to find out where this place was I wanted to check out the bartender.   Finally I got a hold of him...YAY!!!  Well...Bartender guy...he's pretty cute actually.  I didn't spend a dime on any drinks...cuz they were all on him!  Now that's my kind of drinkin!  =)  So I was sitting there doing shots w/ Ryan and guy come up behind me ask me if I was doing 3 shots...I told him no, just 2...and 1 for Ryan.  He's like ""ohhh I see"" and then introduced himself.  And then introduced his friend...Both were pretty hot.  Then some other guy is like all talkin' to me...I was like so in my glory!  *Drool*  

Anyways I had a pretty good night to end it all.  Oh and before I met Ryan...I was stopped at a red light at Sheridan & the Blvd. and some guy stops next to me, backs up and opens the window and says ""It's not my fault""  I was like 'what?' he's like ""It's not my fault"" his friend leans forward and says ""I think your absolutely beautiful!""  All I could do was say 'Thank you' b/c I was trying to rid myself of the super inflated ego!  LOL  This ended up being a totally rockin' night!

Mainly b/c this person really is just hard to get to open up.  I feel as if I've been discouraged to ask any questions to get to know him better...which kills me totally!  I don't try to be intruding but to get to know somebody you have to ask questions, it's the only way to start a conversation.  Why must you be so recluse to the people around you...or even the world around you.  Not everyone is the same...so if you don't occasionally give someone a chance how do you know who they are?  Ya just don't hun...and I myself honestly, I'm here.  I want to be your friend, but you have to relax a little and let me in.  It's almost like we're so much alike...but we're different in so many ways.  One being, that I will open up a little and let someone in and so forth.

So this morning I called the DR and they called in a new prescription for me.  So I picked that up before work.  My eyes look a lot better tonight actually.  I've got to put these drops in every 2 hours for the first 2 days...and 4 hours for the last 5 days.  I'm just thankful I don't look like I've smoked a pound of pot anymore.  YaY!  

So Kim called me this morning at like 11ish...that was a big surprise.  I haven't talk to her in 3 months.  She just wanted to know what I was up to and if she could borrow my breast pump.  So I talked to her for like 1/2 hour and A. Kris & U. Alan are seperated...the once ""absolutely perfect family""....is NOT DYSFUNCTIONAL!!  It's so funny!  They were like the picture perfect family around everyone and now this happens.  It's about time the real american family shows up.  Welcome...you'll fit in nicely!  

Furthermore, she stopped at the stand and picked it up.  Joey has gotten so big since he was born.  His hair stands up in a mohawk though!  Poor kid!  TJ has gotten big too.   

Anyways...that's all.  Oh and lastnight at work my boss was spraying down the patio and under the counter was a chocolate flavored condom!  LMAO  So I gave it to Krissy today as a joke!"

Build a brick wall around yourself, and hide away inside and make sure nobody knows whats going on with you.  I don't like that, maybe b/c it's too much like myself.  Stupidly though(I think)...I took down part of my wall and let you in.  I just hope I don't regret that.  I don't dare use the phrase I'm not like other girls...but for lack there of other ways to explain myself, that's what I am.  Not like every other.  I'm not here to cause problems and such.  I'm just here to be a friend; someone to listen, someone to hang out with, and so forth.  I just ask you not to take advantage of that."

"event","it's like I knew something and then yet I find out what on accident and then I'm not exactly sure what to do with it all.  It doesn't help to understand you exactly...but answers a few questions as to why you are who you are.  I'm not about to turn either...I'll be here, even at the craziest of times.

You're different.  I like that.  It's hard to explain...maybe it's the surprises that go hand in hand with it all.  Def. makes not understanding you even better...I like less predictable people.  

So when we looked up the other night and saw clouds(blah)...look up tonight and see the stars, they're absolutely beautiful.  I like that to, b/c I didn't expect that and the fact you brought it up makes it special.

So that's all.  *yawn*  Goodnight."

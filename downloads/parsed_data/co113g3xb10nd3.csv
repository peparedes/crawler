"event","""Consciousness leads, in the narrator's formulation, to 'intensively developed individuality' and involves separation, loneliness, isolation.  Such withdrawal, however, while desperately defending the validity of the individual, paradoxically recognizes his dependence on humanity at large.""  -Ralph E. Matlaw.

This is (a very small) section of the introduction Matlaw wrote for ""Notes From Underground"" by Dostoevsky.  The whole thing is pretty interesting.  But then again, it's Sunday afternoon and I could probably be entertained by staring at the floor if I tried hard enough, so if you have lots of energy and prospects for more stimulating activities, you should probably take them instead of reading this."

"event","<lj-cut text=""dream"">I'm in Jon's living room.  It's warm, I can feel my brain buzzing slightly.  The room is dark but there's the calming hues of the blue and green light bulbs on the mantel.  I don't know if I'm alone or not, but I don't see people.  I start looking at the computer because it looks like it's shaking.  Then I realize it's quivering, seemingly out of fear.  At first I think this is funny, and then really weird.  Suddenly I hear it shriek, ""I'm falling!  Aghhh!  I'm falling!""  I don't say anything because I can't believe the computer is talking.  It quiets down and starts shaking harder.  A few seconds go by, then ""I'm falling!  Help me, I am falling off this desk!  He put me on the edge, I'm gonna fall!""  It's this really high-pitched voice, only this time it's not funny, I'm actually worried because the thing sounds so distraught.  I say ""Don't worry, you have plenty of room, you are not going to fall.""  It starts whining ""yes...yes I am...I'M GOING TO FALL, HELP MEEE!"" I sigh and tell it again it's not going to fall.  Then it stops shaking and starts making sounds like it's crying.  ""I'm going to fall.""  It sounds calmer for a while, then starts quivering...then shrieking again.  I feel the urge to go pat it but when I start to get up I can feel it being afraid I'm going to knock it off so I sit back down.  The rest of the dream is just the computer getting really upset, then calming down, then getting upset again.  I certainly hope it's not recurring."

<lj-cut text=""gemini"">""The Gemini were twin brothers named Castor and Pollux.  They were warriors and one of them, Castor, was killed.  Pollux missed his brother so badly, he begged Jupiter, the king of the gods, to be permitted to give his life as a ransom for his brother.  Jupiter was moved to pity-sometimes, if you efface yourself enough and get them in the right mood, the old-bastard gods come through-and allowed Castor and Pollux both to live, but not at the same time.  Castor lived one day in the heavens, while Pollux was in Hades, or hell; then Pollux lived one day in the heavens, while Castor was in hell.  They alternated life and death but they didn't see each other.""  This was in a book I was reading, and it reminded me of YOU."

"event","i just wrote my heart out (literally. ow......) on this stupid thing, clicked ""rich text"" to underline something, and it erased.  my interpretation: 1)nothing i say is important enough to be underlined.  2)it is not good to tell people how you really feel in an online journal.  3) i am going to fail my world lit test.  
i dreamed about sweaty playing cards last night.  woke up hungry.  (not really)
i think i'm missing something.  because nothing you have done in the last 24 hours has made sense to me.  no, i'm not that great at judging people anyway, but seriously.  figure out what you want and go for it, i have decided to be totally passive for the rest of my life.  not really, but there are only two people who i want to actively seek out to talk to right now, and....i don't know, i'm just scared.  i am friends with them, but i also think my not-so-honorable intentions are somehow visible in my irises or something.  wouldn't that SUCK.
fuck i have to study.  oh! and another thing.  even though it's true i really like travis from blink 182, i like mark hoppus more.  
AND IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHO THE TWO PEOPLE ARE: you don't.  so if you were planning to tease me about being scared, fuck you, you might be who i'm talking about anyway.  ""not-so-honorable intentions"" don't always mean fuckin ya'll."

"event","after yesterday, it's going to take quite a bit to get me depressed.  I got four things I've really been craving.  I would say what they were but....even if I did anyone who read this would probably be like ""what?  are you serious?  FREAK!"" but you should know that they cost nothing, and they're the best things in the world.  I had a great time last night, but I can't stop feeling unwanted.  it's great.  there's nothing like annoying yourself.  

by the way, my weekend was nothing out of the ordinary.  I went to Auburn, I went to Birmingham.  As always, I was meek and well-behaved.  What's with all the assumptions?"

"event","My dad got me Bacardi beads at Mardi Gras.  It's insane how well he knows me.  I have no more cigarettes.  I dreamed last night I broke my right hand and got lost in a haunted house.  It was so fucking scary I couldn't go back to sleep.  The song I was writing is just going to have to remain incomplete forever because I am creative no more.  I wasn't that creative to begin with, and I have now stopped trying at all.  I really don't see the point.  It doesn't even feel like self-expression anymore, it feels like I'm figuring out chords and writing down words that rhyme.  yesterday, sitting outside panera with heather, i felt like i could see the rest of my life, just dwindling away into something mediocre and me becoming a bourgeoise.  not a happy thought.  then I came back here and figured out EVERYTHING.  sheesh, I know so much more now than I did yesterday.  it's good to be informed.  the more I think about Saturday, and Jason saying social contact was God saying ""here's a little treat,"" the less depressed I get.  because if that's true, then I got a huge treat Saturday, and another yesterday, and I have all kinds of faith in today.  I hope academics don't bite me in the ass anytime soon."

"event","there are so many things I just don't understand.  so much depth of emotion I don't think I've ever felt, and I'm not sure I ever will.  my viola teacher used to tell me that I'd be able to play a lot more expressively when I fell in love-and I've never understood what he was trying to say.  for one thing, how would that effect the way I play?  but more importantly, why hasn't it happened yet?  am I dead on the inside?  I have been watching the breakdown of many couples recently-not just people here-and how it not only kills the people left behind, it also kills the people who are supposedly moving forward.  however, there are also those who stay in a relationship just to avoid hurting the person....and that's not healthy either.  I have a really hard time agreeing with my mother when she says I should date more when I think of people I know who are so ""in love"".  One of two things happens: 1)they break up.  at least one of them is crushed. or 2) they get married.
Marriage does not seem like the way to go to me, but I won't get into my theories.  I realize that hormones make the world go round.  But it's not like you have to be in a relationship to be satisfied.  then again, I'm probably missing something extraordinarily important.  or maybe I'm just eighteen and bitter.  too much thinking.

Oh, by the way, I have a new hero.  Jean Jacque Rousseau.  He said that truth is whatever you want it to be.  If you think the moon is made out of cheese, then hell, the moon is made out of cheese.  Anyone who goes against you is an ignoble and bad person.  Also, government is stupid and tribes have it all figured it out. I wonder how he felt about drug usage....."

you want to know what I've done all day?  I spent my entire day sleeping, reading a John Grisham book about football, and trying not to read so much into the way you treat me.  Ugh.  After last nights escapades, I am itching to get out of here.  I discovered for the 800th time that my mother is a moron who likes people only as much as they let her use them.  This afternoon I was starving and waiting for Dad...and I would've gotten impatient and ill, but how can you lose patience with someone who brings you exactly what you want for dinner then washes your car out of the goodness of their heart?  You can't.  Even if they're a little late.  The one bizarre thought I've had all day:  how funny it would be if someone left their virginity to somebody in their will.  you know?  like ""I want you to take my virginity"", except at that point it would be impossible....but it would still mean something, I guess....I don't know, it just cracked me up."

I love dancing and reggae music.  I just wish I was sexy enough to do it all the time.  I so would.  I just wrote my paper on two characters in this book becoming more mature and experiencing sex for the first time (ideas supplied by Rachel, who is secretly my brain.  I just pretend to think.)  It makes me wonder how my whore of a former best friend is doing these days.  And also if I'm ever going to get any ever ever again.  I stayed up all night and I feel perfectly normal.  I wonder how long I could do that.  Hey, it's a long weekend!  OK, time to go home and socialize.

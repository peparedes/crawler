"event","So I decided that with my recent failure of my statistics test it may be a very good idea, to kick my ass in gear and start doing better. So I'll be reading the chapter earlier tomorrow than I normally do, and this time I'll keep up with the reading assignments and homework assignments and try to do well on those terrible quizzes. I can't lose what I've worked so hard to get now.
I was envious of Michelle today, I hate it when I get mad like that, if I put more effort into everything... but all I ever have time for is band so the rest is(time for nothing but) suffering.
I want more, but I can't afford any more. I'm spent right now, I've spent myself and I'm trying to gather whats left or a last ditch effort to try and overcome all that has overcome me this year. So far, I'm failing miserably at all of this and falling back into the old routine.
It hurts.

"event","What is it, fundamentally, that allows us to recognize <i>who has turned out well?</i> That a well-turned-out person pleases our senses, that he is carved from wood that is hard, delicate, and at the same time smells good. He has a taste only for what is good for him; his pleasure, his delight cease where the measure of what is good for him is transgressed. He guesses what remedies avail against what is harmful; he exploits bad accidents to his advantage; what does not kill him makes him stronger. Instinctively, he collects from everything he sees, hears, lives through, <i>his</i> sum: he is a principle of selection, he discards much. He is always in his own company, whether he associates with books, human beings, or landscapes: he honors by <i>choosing</i>, by <i>admitting</i>, by <i>trusting</i>. He reacts slowly to all kinds of stimuli, with that slowness which long caution and deliberate pride have bred in him: he examines the stimulus that approaches him, he is far from meeting it halfway. He believes neither in ""misfortune"" nor in ""guilt"": he comes to terms with himself, with others; he knows how to <i>forget</i>--he is strong enough; hence everything <i>must</i> turn out for his best.

I kind of understand that better now.

Things have been kind of up and down lately, one minute im depressed the next im happy the next im angry, the next i want to be alone, the next I want to be surrounded in a sea of people, idk whats wrong, but I think I may be ready for this vacation to end.
I started skipping meals these past few days I don't really know why, all i know is that I wasn't feeling very hungry at all.

I didn't really get into the holiday spirit this year, not that thats a bad thing, and I don't think im going to accomplish my goals for this break(not all the way but I guess i did set them too high to begin with)
I finished learning 3rd movement last week but getting it up to tempo is proving to be impossible, especially one measure and a half run...2nd movement kinda went downhill but its doing better now, and Metric Lips is done, just need to play it together with everyone else.
I'm thinking of going to piccomolos today just because I'm tired of being here.
The clan seems to be thriving just fine, I really can't wait until I get a 360 and H3 I really want a job but as usual the places i want to work don't have ay spots left open and the other places i could work, well im afraid they won't be able to fit into my schedule...at all...

"event","The horrors of marching band are now over, I can focus more time on Region band, and region orchestra(which im not even ready for) plus I really cannot wait until Quintessence comes in so I can start on the 5th episode of that(its in episodes not movements who knows how long it is). 

Polaris is coming along nicely, I have to work everyday on what are quickly becoming the new basics:
32nd note practicing on the notes in polaris(mainly on the 3 set of 32nd note runs because i can hit the rest of the single set 32nd note runs)
1 handed 2 mallet rolling- I can somewhat do it with the right hand but the left is still far off
Practing the areas that require octave placement of the mallets(I am now getting proficient at it surprisngly)
Practicing the areas that require double-note(one note 1or2 step(s) away from the next on the same hand) placement-doing alright with this but its much harder than octaves
And coming soon:
1 hand 2 mallet rolling while playing 16th notes on opposite hand-I tried doing it a couple of times already and I can't

I can now play through the recording on Innovative's percussion site and am working towards learning more

Obstacles still in my way:
-the 1 hand 2 note rolls with notes played simultaneously are literally the next measures I need to learn so I may just skip them
-I still can't play the entire 1st page
-I haven't been able to connect it all together because there are some parts I can play near tempo and others that I can't

Now for what you've been waiting for Halo2 today:

1st BTB
Relic
Land Grab
Tone of the battle-simple and laggy

We started off in an okay spot, could have been better though, I got the beam and did some damage with it and sniped for most of the match, it was cut short because we won by well, 5 minutes, we almost always had 4 of the 5 territories

2nd BTB
Waterworks
Multi-flag CTF
This was by far much more difficult
They scored immediately and we were screwed that was pretty much it i managed 5 lousy kills and died 15 times...
We did score once though and that was sweet

3rd BTB
Relic
Team Slayer BR(to 100)
This was insane, we were on the losing end for most of this game
people played stupidly and didn't use cover effectively, we would get mowed down one by one
basically me Hog, and Fearless had to spend the match trying to make up for everyone elses errors and we did just that
I have to say, normally when we play Halo2 I'm a modest guy, i know i make a contribution and I'm always proud to do it, but this match the reason we won, I take full credit for, I kept driving us, pointing out faults here and there and finding a way to get ahold of the beam rifle and kick ass with it, this match basically reinstated me as the sniper designee
because i played smart and helped the team out we ended up tying it up at the end and  winning it! 100-98

4th BTB
Coagulation
Neutral Bomb
This match was total bs, early on i did what I always do(and did it well damnit) but they immediately had a dude try to stand-by, he got booted but then someone else pulled it and it worked, they scored once, the second time, I timed it right and killed the bomber and hid the bomb behind the base, next BDB decided we should rush it so we did, it didn't work but i did start arming it and scare the hell out of them, next they rushed again, I timed it right again and ended up assassinating the bomber tking it and hiding it for the rest of the match, while Busch trash-talked up a storm...

5th BTB
Relic
1-Flag CTF
The guys we played were idiots they ran in straight lines, they rushed the 'Hog and we killed it literally 3 times in every defensive round. I remember once when he got stuck and we were swarming him Beefstew yelled out ""Hey dude, where the fuck did you learn how to drive!"" and then BAM they were dead
Our offense rounds were spectacular on our first rush we all survived and BDB made it to the flag point, then he almost died(he was the only one left up there) and I picked off the guy chasing him and yelled at him to grb it and go, he did just that and Beefstew made the save and from there we hid it at the flag point and just killed them again and again for a little while, it pwned, we pwned

6th game-custom
Zanzibar
1-Flag CTF
This was amazingly fun, they got it once we go it 3 times took us 8 rounds to win it all(8 total only 4 for us) we started with a tough offense got it out while i sniped them and that was that we picked it up and scored it
on defense was difficult, i got the shotgun and killd the 2 warthog guys only to hav the warthog blow me up we staved them off long enough that time
next round we took it again was a little harder but we inched it back and won, SoulP is amazing when it comes to flags and bombs i swear
next round it was alot harder Busch raider was pissed this time, they punched a hole in our defense and dragged it to the beach entrance under the sea wall but we wiped them all out, I remember BuschRaider appearing behind me with a sword and I was justwith m crappy shotgun(just wasted my sniper) I shot him once almost gutted his shield and he noticed me, I thought I was dead and thats when the greatest idea I've ever had in the middle of a battle occured, as soon as he lunged at him I tried to melee! he flew through me and i turned around and BAM he was dead in 2 shots and very very pissed, right afterwards our guys stopped them and round over
the next round they held us off very well(even fierce animal who I almost killed again and again)
next defensive round was awesome! Bones rushed his ghost  and tried to kill me with my shotgun, i killed him then the warthog appeared in front of me, with Badger driving and sqd gunning sqd was busy taking out fearless who had just grabbed the rockets so I went for them and the last hting I heard from badger before I killed him was ""No down in front of us down in front of us!""  then the warthog got flipped by my grenade an as Sqd hopped out I shot the warthog it blew up we both died!(my favorite moment of the day)
Next offensive round I took my time to kill FierceAnimal and got the sniper we ran it out and got it the f' out of there just in time for me to say goodbye heh

in the postgame FierceAnimal said ""B34n3r you are the luckiest son of a bitch ever, your not good your just lucky too fuckin lucky!""
And i reminded busch of our little tango that I had won heh

all in all best H2 experience since early this year(even with the losses)"

"event","As time goes on, more and more I find things going downwards.The harder I push, the harder am I repelled. 
The toll this is taking on me is becoming more and more as time goes on. 
I am trying to hold on but things seem to be falling apart slowly behind my back.
People are still angry with me, the technique used must improve before i can learn more, the other solo i want is still not in(has been ordered) and I haven't learned the tympani part for Region band auditions yet.
Their invisible revenge hurts me, they mock me, they show jealousy and loathing, they all misunderstand my aim, my goal. 
How hard is to not understand though.

I don't practice to impress them, nor him. I don't practice because I have nothing better to do. I don't practice because I need to escape. I practice because i love the music i play, i think its genuinely beautiful
I don't care that they don't like me, i don't care that life seems to pass me by because of it, and I don't care that I'm the only one who can do this. Or at least i am doing my best not to care about such things still life throws challenges at me at every corner.
Parts of me show signs of weakness sometimes I look at it all and want to stop, try and salvage anything i can, then some grim reminder that I can't like today's, I knew my path before and that just reinforced it.
Again. 

I realized the power of feelings a little better, another expermient to carry out this week, this one will be more difficut, oh and the last one is almost over and has gone better than planned but might not end well."

I started another of my experiments, on love, to see the effects again, this time may be different, I hope it will be anyways seeing that again I am the subject.

Today sucked
I realized that they all seem to hate me now, and i don't know exactly what to do...
I stand at my own precipice
One the one hand, I can stop now, and salvage what I can of everything.
One the other hand. I can sever all ties, do what is needed work with them on what I need to and ignore them 100% of the rest of the time. Which at this point is exactly what I am planning on doing.
Tomorrow I up my training schedule
From now on I practice before 1st period(I'll also be leaving home earlier to get there when less people are there but the school is still open)
I will not be spending B-Lunch with michelle, ryan, and jillian(girl in my comp sci class) any more, I'll spend them in the auditorium doing more work.
Tuesdays and Thursdays I'll be practicing after school in the hall between right after school and the beginning of the 5:30 practices.
Wednsday is now my only day off.
I'm going to let any and all friendships suffer, excepting Kaitlyn and Michelle, Kait because well she is kinda the section leader, and michelle, I don't know why , but I have a strong feeling that I should, as for the rest of the drumline, they don't bug me, i don't bug them, simple as it sounds, hopefully...
Something else I realize now, no matter how much they push you have to push back harder. And when one  never knew how to push, the strength is increased 2 fold as well as their feelings lashed and battered 2 fold more as well. Thus I wound myself to increase my strength, as Nietzsche once said ""That which does not kill me makes me stronger."" Its my turn to prove that.

"event","Today:

Woke up at 7:30 like usual, hurried to get ready for school and was able to pack XBOX and Laptop for trip after school...

Left at 8:00 a.m. for a quick 4-Mallet Maimba Cram Session, was able to learn the piece and laughed when I saw the big smile of Mr. Steven's face as he came in to see everyone practicing for the audition, he was so proud he took a picture and said ""It's so nice to see everyone here, cramming for their auditions"" with the most sarcastic smile he could muster then left us to our business

8:45 left to Web Mastering

9:00-10:30 a.m. Watched the movie dodgeball in class, very funny, lots of fun

10:30-12:12 headed to band for audition and met up with Erika in the hall, she told me about going make-up shopping and then left to meet up with Brian
I continued on to Band class where I had another chance to perfect everything before I went into the room

I auditioned 4th or 5th (random order you went when you wanted to) and nailed the Snare piece and half-butchered/half-nailed the snare sightreading piece. I did well on the 3 mallet selection and alright but not great on the 4mallet thing, then got all the notes but fucked up the Mallet sightreading(a step-up from last year believe me) then played the Timpani superbly and he said I got a great pitch/tone out of the drums when I played and that he thought I worked on that alot(i didn't but oh well)
The rest of band was very boring

12:12-1:04 p.m. Went to Pre-Cal got split into another class with Phillip(cool german guy i know) we played calculator games all period, I beat him at basball 4 times, he wasn't happy

1:04-1:34 p.m. The Event of the Semester!

I leave the class and head to the cafeteria only to remember that since all the seniors were taking their Pre-Cal finals I had no one to sit with(lost Phillip) and the Senior dining room section(which i normally sit it during B-Lunch) was totally blocked off with all the tables moved around the cafeteria in a haphazard manner. I realized I couln't sit near the Senior Dining room because Erika and her boyfriend, Brian, had the same lunch.

So I decided to play it safe and sit outside  towards the school parking lot at an empty table..surely she wouldn't go out there. So I sit there for a little while by myself contemplating all the possibilities when I think ""What if Erika and Brian come sit here, then what do i do???"" and I couldn't come up with a logical answer so I banished the thought from my head thinking it wasn't much of a possibility anyways...

Almost 2 seconds after that moment I look up(was looking at my food for a sec) and see, of ALL PPL, Erika, with Brian in tow... 
My heart raced and thoughts flashed through my mind, I killed them all, cleared my mind and throat and said ""Hi"" to Erika and introduced myself to Brian and he, surprisingly enough introduced himself to me, ""not a complete bastard"" i thought. Then we ate, and talked a little, Erika had quite a bit to say, me and Brian just kind of sat there, and listened, at first i thought it was just coincidence but as the lunch went along I began to see a semblance of me inside of him, when Erika told him that she couldn't exempt any classs because of all her abscenses and said she'd have perfect attendance next year, we both started laughing, same time... when she tried to do the damn High-Five shit that she likes to pull(She makes you give her a high five, to the side, to the side, the down low and pulls her hand away and cries ""Too Slow!!"") on me and he said ""Yeah she makes me do that to her.."" I said ""I believe you"" we laughed...it was so odd how alike we were, it was like we were friends and we had never even met before or wanted to meet for that matter...

It wasn't awkward it was kind of like sitting with a luckier version of me, and now that the whole experience has sunk in my entire attitude has changed

I realize and always did that, I never wanted to meet Brian, and perhaps he never wanted to meet me, because I/we knew that, deep down, that once there was some kind of personification of him in my mind rather than something I had made up based on what I assumed were facts, that I wouldn't have much reason to want Erika. He is as I am, and I can't take her from him, and now I don't want to. He won the battle before it began and there's nothing I can do. My spirit is broken and now I'm ready to leave her behind with him, because I know everything will turn out great for them, its time to return to Cy-Fair, the vacation is beginning to draw itself to a close..."

I wanted to see her online i wanted a witty exchange of nonsensical argumentsthat always happens between us i waited for a long time...I finally got tired of waiting so i did something out of charcter for the ""Cypress"" side of me the one who doesn't talk too much who likes to be by himself and in the group at the same time...it decided to call her. One of the few times i have ever but what can i say i wasn't used to not talking to her for more than a week i missed her and whats strange is that i don't really miss anyone ever...so i called acted what i would consider to be a doofus(what else to expect from that side of me) but not too badly and asked why she hadn't been online lately...turned out she had been online lately just on AIM and i happen to only have yahoo so i reasoned to her ""well i kinda forgot to bring my TV back home from the holidays and i was lonely and she said she'd get on in a few minutes 'round ten...but i think i stupidly exaggerated that i had nothing to do..stupidity ugh...feelings ugh...feelings of that sort anyways...I waited patiently and excitedly and right when i wasn't looking(woudn't ya know it) she got on and said hi so we talked for a little bit about her bad day and how she disguised her feelings when i talked to her on the phone so i wouldn't hear it and i thought wait a sec...... What?Hid your feelings(i didn't say this) She can't even express her feelings outwardly only when i talk to her online and i've never seen her cry and i can honestly say she never let herself be weak around me its as if im just like everyone else and she treats me that way but how can i say it? How can I tell her? I don't want you to mask your feelings when your with me if your sad then be sad and if your happy then put on a smile...it does me worse to know im just being lied to...but does it matter she hasn't ever been really with just me usually with everyone else except for one time when we went to go see a movie but the guy who works(might be worked now depends when u read this)at academy never showed upbut back then we weren't as good friends as we are now(or ""were then""...again depends on the time period when reading journal entries) After we talked a little bit i remember adding in a little comical bit that included a warning and then all of a sudden she left...

And thats when i realized how much i depend on her as she depends on me...I waited and i wait now to see if she comes back online its sad isn't it i can't wait to come home and go online to talk to her everyday its too much of a habit and i think for some reason i did something wrong to make her just up and leave i just don't know exactly what now im not sure whether to feel bad or not and guess what I miss her again and now its too late to call her...sometimes i hate myself...sometimes i hate myself for being myself...sometimes i hate myself for being myself and loving someone who i shouldn't"

"event","Sure i've thought about it, i think about it alot but i can't find it lgical to believe there is a god...don't dismiss me as an atheist don't dismiss me as an agnostic, although if it did come down to it i'd prefer the latter...don't dismiss me as not having enough intellect to come to such a conclusion...go to the www.philosophyforums.com an check out the logic section you'll find advanced logic can't prove the existance of a god and while all logic proves that it is possible there never has been, and never will be, unbiased and objective logic that says there is a god even the attempts of the all religions(not just any one i don't pick on religions jsut to make that clear) to prove that god does exist through are full of ambiguously interpreted wording and useless add ons make it hard if not impossible for someone to find the fault that lies within all logical proofs of gods existence and if u go onto the forums and read and dismiss logic as useless in and of itself then you yourself are demonstrating the idiocy of faithful and blind religious followers and i don't need your crap i.e. god just exists, he just does, and so on...

One question i have for a ""christian""(and/or other religions there could possibly be others containing this paradox) you get into heaven by doing ""selfless"" deeds correct? First Define ""Selfless""- Second If you know you can get into heaven by doing only selfless deeds then well how can you perform a selfless deed knowing what your doing is getting you into heaven? bit of a paradox isn't it?

Here is the ""stone paradox"" can you really solve it and still believe god is omnipotent
Either God can create a stone which God cannot lift, or God cannot create a stone which God cannot lift
Either way it means he is not oomnipotent...


Here's another:
Would suicide be an example of such? It's logically possible - there is no impossibility to the idea of self-destruction. I can do it with the pull of a trigger. But if God cannot do the same, he is limited in such a way as not to possess a power that every ordinary human has. Then again, if he can do it, he does not possess a power that no human has either - immortality. Is this right, or am I missing something?

Thats all on that for now

There was this girl, no its not like that but you'd think so wouldn't you, i knew her from band(i know a lot of ppl from band) and i was bored one day and she was on AIM(AOL Instant Messenger) so i decided to talk to her and see if perhaps out of some strange happening id be able to carry on some kind of conversation(im not the best talker and i was worse back then)surprisingly enough i found it quite easy to talk to her and we talked for a couple of hrs. now being the smart person i am i figured she seems to be of more intelligence than most ppl i've ever met..hrmm, i wonder..."" So i tried feebly to explain the real me (this btw was near the beggining of my foray into philosophy)...

Well obviously it didn't work well and she ended up missing the point entirely, her mind is sharp enough but a little too simplistic...but what could i do with this ""experiment"" or ""accident""(i use both terms loosely)...we were basically friends and i had to deny that she had understood me in the wrongest way
 how could i not? we were basically friends and whether she was smart enough to comprehend if i had tried to explain again didn't matter by then... 

I had a lot of trouble comprehending it myself much less try to explain it to someone else with less mental capability(not to be arrogant or mean understand that whether i or anyone else for that matter likes it or not its undeniably true)

So i refuted that she had gotten it wrong and we still talked and became great friends and to this day remain so we talk whenever we can and she is my link to the high school i went to last year. And I like her alot...but of course i would refute that if asked ;( 
Would it work if we got together probably not even though i hate to see her so sad and alone i have made myself a shoulder to cry on...and while it may change later, for now...it won't,i can't, i won't let myself, not until the end...when i know there is no chance. Then i will be able to tell her the truth. and until then i wait , i share her triumphs and travails(lol not the third definition) and do the best i can with what i was given...so to speak

So after this experience i realized i couldn't explain who i was to anyone i can't seem to find someone who is like me and comprehend me i have only found one but even that is little consolation...the fact remains...so i after exhausting those options i chose to do this its not perfect and it can't offer e any feedback considering its basically like typing things to a brick wall but i don't mind the feedback would be negative anyways...either negative or fake positive which is in a lot of way even worse if i need someone to try and raise my spirits ill consult a mortician thx(reference to a simpsons episode btw)"

"event","I have mixed feelings about XBOX Live sure the game(Halo2 duhh) is fun when playing online but there aren't enough great team games most often i run into the worst team that can't discern what the hell its doing which is pretty sad considering that im a level 9 so you'd think that matchmaking would place me with some higher caliber people. But thats just how it is you run into smacktards nd jerks everywhere...but those few special games where there is a team where verything is coordinated and uncoordianted and it all intertwines into one perfectly well-tuned machine, thats what i play for thats what i dream of...thats why i joined a clan but unfortunately those guys can't seem to be online when i could use them the most so oh well i guess..."

"event","Back in seventh grade I met or rather knew this girl, she was pretty and cute but being who i was then i said nothing.I was in symphonic band then,percussion and surprisingly enough i found out that she was in beginner percussion(it was strange to me back then mostly beginner band was for 6th graders)The year went by and i never said a thing to her at least not that i can remember...

Then eight grade year a new junior high opened i was supposed to go to that new one and so was she...She went and i decided to get a free transfer to my school and stay there with my friends sure i had to find my own way to school everyday but i didn't mind too much(my mother did heh)So an entire year went by you'd think i would just forget about her and i did for the most part i remembered her somewhat but randomly and she wasn't important to me that year...

Then ninth grade started for marching band i had to be at school 4 weeks before school actually started for band camp...well surprisingly enough she was there again i didn't say anything(i never said anything aorund her back then and don't say much anymore either) She seemed twice as beautiful as before and strangely we got put on the same instrument Bells...coincidence? yeah but there is such a thing as fate we don't have as much control as we think...anyways we played those that year..and well what can i say i fell in love(love by my definition anyways) but what did it matter ireminded myself she didn't like me and i just couldn't talk to her it was a little awkward...Valentines day came and what a moment of stupidity that was....i gave her a heart shaped box of chocolates and a rose(had to badger my friend all lunch just to make him lend me the money to get it)but even more stupidity followed i ran off i didn't know what to say and i waited triumphantly for the three day weekend to end to see what would happen...well ended up nothing happened apparently that never happened and im guessing she still will dismiss it as false or just doesn't remember anymore..either way it doesn't matter

Now you would think that was the end of that right? but my stupidity has no bounds i still liked her the next year and i couldn't seem to just not like her i pushed out of sight, out of sight out of mind right?not exactly we got put in the same band that year(again...we were both in the same band 9th grade...)then valentines day came up again this was my greatest moment, the height of my stupidity, i decided i'd ask her out...bad idea?definetely but what did i have to lose?everything...thats what i had to lose
I talked to some so called ""friends"" about it...they urged me to do it
So the day before valentines day comes and we(two other girls me and her) are in the band hall getting ready to go to lunch when she says ""I'll be right back i have to go to the restroom""...Well there was my chance i walked out and waited and as she cam out when noone was there(oobviously) i asked her""I was wondering, Would youi go out with me?""...a look of shock was on her face""No, I'm soory but i don't see you as, im sorry but, sorry...sorry"" and she ran off to join everyone i went too of course i had face to save whether i wanted to cry or not...

I made a promise to myself a few years ago, when i was a child i cried about everything and i had colic as a baby i always cried when anyhthing happened i was a bit of a wimp but i didn't know what to do about it, so one day i decided to stop the tears, no matter what the cost no matter what the case, and i hadn't cried ever since...

Well i went to lunch feeling so terrible i just wanted to die(of course i didn't in the end im still here typing this after all) and not have to worry about her or anything else anymore i got no sympathy from the girls in fact they had more sympathy for her then me what great friends they turned out to be...the other 2 guys were out omewhere and came back during lunch they didn't find out about what i did til 2 or 3 weeks later they were a little surprised to say the least..i went home cried a bunch for 15 min then left to a friends house life had to go on whether i wanted it to or not...
I ended up getting over her but i still maintain she's the prettiest girl i have ever met...and that was basically the end of it we never spoke of it again but i can feel she remembers it everytime she see's me i know i still do everytime i see her
that is what i truly think about Katie and everything that happened between us...

Of course it should also be said that i don't hold anything against her. How could I? she was honest and said no what more could i ask rather a truthful No then a Pityful Yes...and now im over it and it doesn't matter so much any more

"event","If you're reading this then, well you shouldn't be, but what do i care and what can i do about it.I don't want any flaming comments, I don't care how much you disagree with what i say i don't need shit and the only reason im starting this is to have some sort of outlet where i won't get hurt for being who I am.

I might as well start this off by saying a little about me, I'm 16 and alot smarter than you can imagine...and yeah it may seem a little cocky of me to say so but unfortunatly for me its true. I have an amazing long term memory and can remember lots of things most other people can't.I have an extremely short, short-term memory sometimes I'll wake up in the morning not knowing what i did the day before. I am two people in one body i am a cynic and i am an optimist i love to love and hate that i love, i have the biggest heart of anyone you'll ever meet i can't stay mad at anyone i always forgive them but i never forgive myself...im passive but dont' show it, I play video games to escape from reality and i love food(food in general of course) i read philosophy and logic and hve never acted like who i a truly am around anyone in my entire life,I make mistakes like everyone else and unfortunately for me they always haunt me, my mind is plagued by bad memerios almost all of them are bad the good memories aren't even great they're no consolation to the idiocy that is me...
thats all for now

A few of the friends I tried to get in touch with just to see how they were doing blocked me, which has completely defeated the purpose of my new myspace account.

My new class started today, and not only do I have a hard teacher, but the books are killing me.  I just saw an entire paycheck blown in the course of a few minutes (is that why I'm working so hard?)...

And so starts the tone for most of my life over the past two days. What a weekend!  I managed to loose my wallet in a church, loosel my keys in a restaurant, find out a new position at work isn't so much about selling as assembling (and I imagine I will reporting plenty of battle wounds...the person training me got 3 today just showing me stuff! *gasp*), lost an hour looking at people's profiles on myspace (though a part of me refuses to sign up), and spent about 5 hours working on a project for my boss I won't get paid for.  

I also found out one of my bosses' is a very ignorant and racist person.  I am so completely shocked at what she is doing, and it's gets harder for me to see her as a person with each remark and action against minorities.  I've even put my position in danger by reporting some of this to the district manager, but I don't know what else to do.  I feel so powerless.

I also learned I need to get lots more sleep.  I am very crabby.  You've been warned. ^_^"

Today was...weird.  I was in a bad mood, then I visited an eldery lady in the nursing home.  I don't know why, but doing good things like that always seems to put me in a much better mood.  I keep telling myself I should do them more often, but...never have time.

I seem to like working myself to death too. I just found out I am scheduled for almost 60 hours next week. *dies* I have a feelings I'll be calling off at one of them one of those days.  In addition to all that it's my first week of the summer semester. I have to be honest, I'm not as young as I use to be. I just don't know if I can do it.

Actually, aside from the wasted gas, I'm pretty happy about the mix up. I got to talk to the person who will be my supervisor.

"event","One thing I really love about my boyfriend (there are other reasons too, but don't tell him that. lol) is that he can make me feel better. Yesterday after my hair cut/dying incident, he joked around with me, we played a game, and then went for a very nice, long 4 mile walk. :) He told me I should call and complain to the corporate office, but I don't think I will.  I think that just not going back will speak for itself.

I think I am falling too much into my past.  I was looking up people I use to know/like/etc and found some of their profiles on myspace. At first I was shocked and understood why we grew apart, but now I find myself going back and have even bookmarked some of their pages.  It's a bit insane, especially when I get the thoughts that none of them will probably even remember me or want to talk to me. lol. Not I think any of them have become bad people, or think that I am a bad person, but I don't know.  I find that as I've become older, I'm a lot more selective about who I spend my time with. Maybe the introvert in me is blossoming, but having tons of friends and always doing and going places isn't so important now.  I remember when I was starting college, I sent out lots of emails, and one year had a christmas card list that topped over 300 people.  I don't think I even sent out 40 last year. It's not that I don't think of the people I've known anymore or want to go out and have a wild and crazy time, it's just that things are different for me now.  I'm working like crazy with two jobs, trying to save up for a place of my own. This week, I'm working well over 40 hours and training for a new position at one of my jobs to hopefully get more hours and ultimately a promotion. The 4 mile stroll with my boyfriend was a wonderful, romantic break. Going shopping, going out to eat, to the club, to the movies just don't seem to compair with that.

But then there are times like today when I am working a 12 hour day and just want to pick someone up afterwards and go crazy.  The gemini in me seems to make things very complicated. 

In other news, I think that Microsoft Word really sucks.  Each time I type in the word ""may"" it seems to think I mean the date. grrr. Anyone know if there is a way to turn that off?"

"event","So...I've been wanting to do something with my hair for months now. I made 3 false attempts this week when other things have come up and today, sat down in the chair thinking of the possibilities. 

And it was fun.  I thought of weird ways to describe the experience (my first time getting all around highlights and basically telling the stylist to be creative, so I was excited), I was all smiles after the tin foil was gone, and was able to come out the salon happy when I talked to the lady about leaving a tip.  I basically gave everything I had left in my wallet because I was very happy, which amounted to $20 and well over the ""basic"" 15% gratuity they suggested and gave the person 5 of 5 with the after service survey.  I thought I was showing my appreciation.

But....and there's always a but!...the clerk made the comment that I was wasn't scoring her high enough and the tip wasn't nearly enough for all the work that was done.   :(  

I don't think I'll ever go back, and now can't even enjoy the new hairdo so much because of it.  Maybe it's because it just happened, but I already can't wait for the highlight to grow out long enough so I can get my hair ""dyed"" back to my ""natural"" color."

When we when shopping and he insisted on buying me flowers, I asked if I could ever buy flowers for him, knowing in a few days a pretty bouquet would show up at his office for him. He told me he would eat them.

So yesterday when I was at my craft store job, I bought some candy melts and a lolipop mode of daisies and made him a bouquet of candy flowers.  I told him it was because he said he would eat the flowers if I ever bought them for him.

...but really I just wanted him to have flowers he could eat so he wouldn't be so tempted when the real flowers came.  And he told me last night he was considering calling off today.

I practically begged him to go to work! *giggles* I'm sure he'll understand, but he was very confused last night. *evil grin*

2 days ago, we told each other how we felt, and when I said that I loved him I couldn't stop crying.  I don't know why.  It's only been a month since we've met, but I just have a feeling deep down he'll be a part of the rest of my life.  It's been quite a surprise for me.  I insisted I never believed in love at first site, yet he had a firm grip on my heart since I first saw him. I insisted I would probably never be in love, yet I'm pretty sure I feel that right now.  I can't stop thinking of him. Each time I see or hear from him the world just fades and everything seems as it should be.

I had often thought the people who get married after knowing each other for such a short period of time were quite strange. Suddenly I seem to understand...and relatives from both of our families have said they could see us ending up together. Rather than being scared by it, I welcome those thoughts.

I said I was a little jealous because I usually just get a sigh or an ""Oh boy!"", yet a drink gets that much attention.  He said the feeling he gets when he's with me doesn't really compare.  I thought that was sweet, so I gave him a kiss, and kissed his neck....and when I stopped he looked at me and said..

Though now I am kicking myself in the rear for not writing in here to keep a journal of our memories.  

But I will try my bestest...here's what I remember...

July 13
We met at a restaurant called LaShish (I think). He had on a striped Calvin Klein (or however you spell it) shirt, jeans, and sandals....and I was wearing a brown-designed shirt, black pants, and suede high heel boots.  We ordered swarmas and I tried hommus for the first time.  I originally wanted to be home to say goodnight to my mother at 10pm...we didn't leave the restaurant until close to midnight.  I thought our dinner went well, but when we went to say good bye, he shook my hand.

July 14
no phone call, no email, no nothing. I began to wonder if only I had a good time.

July 15
I decided to hell with traditions.  I was interested in him, and if he wasn't interested in me, I wanted to hear it from him instead of being given the silent treatment.  I called after visiting my grandfather and left a message.  Moments later he called explaining how upset he was that he didn't make it to the phone in time, and how the phone wouldn't get a signal when he tried to call right away, but when he finally got me on the line said how I had made his day.  

July 17
We exchanged CDs - I gave him one with some Christian music and other songs I like, he lets me borrow John Lennon. :) We went bowling - I beat him the first game! Woohoo! He won the next 3. He made sure my bowling ball was always clean, constantly asked if my wrist was ok, and felt bad when my sister called to get my butt home. 

July 18
I think this was the day we played mini-golf.  ===> <font color=white>I beat him by 3 strokes. *evil laugh* </font>

These days I want to remember so damn badly, but can't.  I just know they happened towards the beginning of the week....

I think Tuesday, Eddie treated me to lunch at a restaurant called The Polish Village.  It was close to my high school and was the first time I returned to the area since I graduated. We took a long walk and I talked a lot about different memories and he was nice enough to listen, even if he didn't want to.  He mentioned if there was other people, and having been pissed off by Kurt I wasn't sure I was ready to trust another person just yet.  So...I told him if he wanted to see anyone else, he could.  He took me in a flower shop and told me to get whatever I wanted...I just got 1 yellow rose.  He said I was easy to please.

I stared at that rose for most of the night, kicking myself in the rear for being such an idiot.  I didn't <i>want</i> him to see other people, I <i>wanted</i> him to be with me.  I prayed for a sign or anything so that I wouldn't make a fool of myself, but vowed the next time I got together with him, I would show him that I really, really cared about.  

And then this happened....

This was a day I wanted to remember, but can't.  If I had to guess I would say it was wednesday the 21th.  I know one day I had a bad day at work, then stayed later the next day because one of the ladies I work with called in sick.  

Anyway, it was off to another bad morning - my deposit was $224 short and I was being rushed to do something I wanted to do slow and make sure it was right. I'm starting to get stressed out and Eddie told me that I could call him anytime I needed to talk, so I was about to get up to go outside and call him on my cell phone. But, the bell rings at the front desk rings and I went to see who was there. It's an older man who asks if there was a Michelle in Accounts Payable.  I told him that was me.  He says he has some flowers for me....

Goes to his car and brings out a dozen yellow roses.  I knew Eddie sent them without reading the card, and suddenly all was well in the world.

..and if you are curious like my co-workers, the card said
""Michelle
You are the <u>best</u>thing that's happened to me in a long time.
 - Eddie""

That night we went to a chaplet and I seemed to do something good and something bad (because I am an idiot after all.  My father doesn't believe in inter-racial dating and Eddie is Mexican.  For some reason I told him this..stupid, stupid, stupid) We held hands (and kissed *beams*) for the first time.    

Over the next few days we rode bikes together, took more walks, talked and talked (I went over my minutes by close to 200 minutes, and that's just in the daytime! I think I used up 2,000 night/weekend minutes...then there's all the times we talked on the land lines.....), he cooked me an ommelete, I met his mom, cousins, sister, niece, nephew, and a great deal of his family - he met my mom who really likes him and my sister (who won't say anything except I spent too much time with him).  He was there to try to help me when I locked my keys in my car, and after riding my bike alone one day and was approached by a strange guy who wanted me to go with him, he didn't ask any questions but came over right away.  

July 30
We spent most of the day together after lunch, then were late for the game. My first Tigers game at the new stadium.  It was raining heavily, but I still had a magic moment when he took me to see the field in the rain.  I don't know what was more beautiful - the scene or being with him.

July 31
His from Kasey came over for a surprise visit.  He stopped by for a few minutes saying 'us' is the most important thing to him, but he needs to spend time with his friend.

August 1
We went to Church together (his parish) and received a blessing from his priest.  There was some trouble with his friend, but I didn't want to leave.  I spent a bit of time with his mom, and his aunt knitted a beautiful scarf for me. When things calmed down in the evening, we took a walk between 10-11pm. The night was beautiful.

August 2
I'm pretty sure we did something, I just don't remember what.  I know he listened to me complain about the lady I had in my bead class though.

August 3
Eddie had a really busy day at work. *wink, wink*

August 4
His mother cooked chili, and I brought over some bread (with the help of a Pillsbury mix) and some peanut butter chocolate candies.  After we took a walk and he found a 4 leaf clover, though he swears <u>we</u> found it.

August 5

"event","Right now, I am, probably for the first time in my life, completely pissed off.

In Febrary I filled my taxes and was expecting a $2,000 refund.  The accountants happily took my money.

As of yet I still haven't received it.

I called them and called them with no answer.

So I finally called the IRS and State departments today.  Guess what? They tell me I never filled.

After I copy these and send them out, I'm going to find out about small claims court to get see if I can get at least a portion of the $110 they charged me for filling my taxes.  I think they should be paid for actually filling out the paperwork, but whatever part of that I was charged for them to e-file I want back. 

And next year, I will be doing my taxes my own self and if they so much as send me a letter saying it's tax time I'm going to send it right back to them."

"event","At around 3:30pm, I went to one bank to take money out of my savings to put it in my checking account to pay for my tuition.  I hate the bank that has my savings account, and here's another reason.

I know i should be studying for my finals, but I have felt like crap so I have been treating myself to a few things, and since I got some money for my birthday I figured I could treat myself very nicely.

I bought a new outfit, starting tanning, bought some new shoes, bought some spa stuff and gave myself a facial, and gave myself highlights. The tanning wasn't going so well so I bought a sunless tanner. Today, I wore the new outfit, had on new shoes, and was showoing off my tan which a lot of people thought looked good. I received a lot of comments from both my jobs about how good I looked.  And to be honest, for the first time in a few days, I actually felt good too.  Plus, I thought I looked pretty cute too.

So, I'm called to this teller's line and told to wait as she holds up her hand her hand with badly bitten light blue nail polish.  Not that I don't like blue nail polish, blue is actually my favorite color. I waited and waited while her and oner her co-workers talked.  The other co-worker was going out to get something.  I imagine it was from Dairy Queen or another sundae place because she eventually decided on a Banana frostee and I do't know many places where you can get those.

Her male co-worker has helped 2 people while she is talking, so of course I getting a little nervous since it's starting to get late and I still have to make the deposit at the other bank.  But I wait as patiently as I can.

When she's finally done with that, she asks how I'm doing, and I told her I was okay and ashed how she was doing.  She responds with, ""Geesh Lady, come on! It's Friday! You look so crabby!""

Half of me wanted to tell her to just close my account right there, but I didn't.  I wanted to ask for the manager and complain, but I didn't.  I have no idea what her name was since she was hiding her sign, but I wanted to go to the web page and write an email about what happened.  I would never imagine telling someone they looked crabby at either of my jobs.  Maybe a family member, or a friend, but definately not a customer.  Do I have a reason to complain? Or am I just taking this out of proportion?"

I set up a journal I might use for creative writing, but I'm not sure yet.  I've had 2 poems stolen from me before - 1 even published under a former friend's name.  I just want to find a way to protect myself first. Not that I'm such a great writer, I just don't think I could handle going through that again.

I found out the fireworks are tomorrow.  That wouldn't upset me so much, except that my ""study day"" isn't a a study day - BOTH of my teachers decided to hold an extra class because we didn't cover the material quick enough. The point of this? My university is about 4 blocks from where the fireworks will be. *scream* If I can't find a parking spot I'm going to be really upset.

I bought one of those things that help squeeze the fat together in most of my trouble spaces (unfortunately a full body model doesn't exist), a Diet Coke, and a bag of those heavenly, highly fattening, chewy, yummy chocolate and caramel cookies.

Of course, I didn't eat the whole bag...two of my co-workers helped devour it my un-clucking my white-knuckled grip.  Maybe I didn't need that tight pair of shorts after all.

My next encounter with strangeness happened at, of all places, McDonald's.  Being an older Neopian, I insist on being able to get a Blue Uni to make my beloved pet.  Unfortunately, we haven't come across one yet.  So, I made my way into the...um...restaurant to ask the check out person which one of the toys they had in their happy meal.  Not only could he not tell me, but when I further asked if he could find out which toy it was, he replied, ""I don't know."" I then asked if he could simply look in one of the boxes behind him and tell me which is in there, and he again replied with an ""I don't know.""  So imagine my surprise when I turned to leave he called, ""Don't you want to order a happy meal?""

Later in the day, I was almost run down by a lady who literally plowed through the parking lot.  I wasn't her only moving target, and the last guy she almost hit to get a parking spot really had words with her.  It seemed she was driving like a maniac because event though the store was open 24 hours, she realized it was the last day of the sale and just had to stock up...on toilet paper.  I sincerely hope she didn't have to ""air dry"" before rushing to the store.

I saw a truck, completely brown with rust which appeared to have never been painted, being offered for $1,5000 or best offer, witnessed my grandpa watching Hannibal, saw my dad sitting on the porch with his dog because he just mopped his floors, and saw a lady with neon pink hair and pants to match with the outfit topped off with a bright yellow shirt and orange jewelry.

I shopped for my groceries listening to a woman sing all the wrong words to a song I use to like, overheard a woman say she eats yogurt instead of drinking milk because milk ""hurts the cows,"" and was hit on by a guy with the worst rotted teeth I've ever seen in my life.

I almost wonder if I've really gotten out of bed or not. Because if this all isn't a dream, I think I'd rather stay under the covers...with another bag of cookies."

"event","I thought I finally took control of my life...and now I'm in utter turmoil again.

The big problem: ""My boyfriend"".

Things just haven't been so good lately.  He told me sometimes in relationships he ""freezes up"" and how he runs ""hot and cold"".

He seemed distant and put me in tears till I was getting sick, and then threw a bomb on me: he started applying for jobs out of state.

What could I do? I'm stupid enough to actually care about him, so I figured I could just live with it....hope for the best and enjoy my time with him.

So Saturday I had a horrible day.  I tried calling him 4 times with no answer.  I just wanted to talk to someone...he never called back, I got very little sleep that night.

Sunday wasn't so great either, then he tells me all the things he had to do on Saturday, but still managed to go shopping and talk to some of his buddies. I was hurt, I don't know why, but I was hurt.

So yesterday when I'm sleeping, he calls and apparently I told him all I wanted to do was sleep.  Which he took to mean all day today, so instead of the plans with him on Memorial day I thought I would have, I stayed home alone thinking - very dangerous thing.

What I came up with?

I've had to drop everything to hear him complain about how he's sick of not finding work, when he pants went missing at the dry cleaners, had to wake up and hear him talk about the final episode of Angel starting at 10:30, even though I had to wake up at 5am to go to work. But he won't do the same thing for me...

I've re-arranged my plans to spend time with him when he asks.  I've missed outings with my friends, left my grandfather's house early, even left work early once, and here I ask him about what I thought we were doing for Memorial day and he made NEW plans and WON'T change them...

He keeps asking me to forgive him because he's ""been single for so long"" when he completely neglects my feelings...I've done it at least twice, and here it is, he wakes me up and whatever I said is golden, but the thoughts while I'm coherent are meanlngless...

he's so quick to tell me he freezes up and runs cold.  I've come close to begging him how he feels about me and he never tells me...

He lives about 30 minutes away.  In our 3 1/2 month relationship, he has come to my area four times.  One other time he was in the area, but instead of visiting me decided he was too tired and went home, but did call to let me know he was ""over there""....

I wish I didn't care so much about him, but like I fool I do.  I've just gotten to the point where I keep screaming that I deserve better than this, but relationships don't come so easily for me, so I wonder if I'm doomed to be lonely and single for the rest of my life.

I just don't know...it seems like breaking up with him seems like the best thing to do, but I just don't know.  At the beginning things were so nice, and then he ""froze up"".  

If I break up with him I'll have more time to be online...

Any advice from anyone?"

In the past 2 weeks, yes, I've gone out with my friends a bit more than usual.  I think we've been to a karaoke bar 3 times.  But, I basically stay with my friends and don't flirt with any of the guys. One of the guys there seems to really like me, and one of my friends, thinking it was cute gave him my number. He keeps calling, though I really am not interested in him at all.  The more I try to blow him off, the more he keeps saying how much more he likes me.

So...I basically told my friends not to try to hook me up with anyone again.  And, hopefully, I'll get up enough nerve to finally tell him I'm not interested.  He just seems like a nice guy and I don't want to hurt his feelings.

Yesterday I was trying a hot oil treatment for my hair because I hate how frizzy it is, and my mother thought I was getting ready to go out with my friends to the bar again.  I told her I wasn't.

And I hate no intention of going. I was feeling like crap.  I told my sister I took some medicine and was going to go to bed.

Well, even though she told me that's good because I looked sick and all that other pretending-to-care bullshit, when mom woke up and I wasn't up and running around she asked my sister if I had gone out.

And my sister told her that I did.  

This sparked a lot of screaming from my mother, so I woke up.  Just in time to hear her call me a ""whore.""

So, now I know what my mother thinks of me...and I know that my sister will lie and do anything she needs to just to her our mother say she's a good sister for worrying.

:) I am happy that her account has been restored though.

So..let's see...

<lj-cut text=""very long....read for sleeping assistance"">Thanksgiving was very peaceful.  I had to go to work twice the day before, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  My friends went out to the bar that night, but I was just too tired to go.  I felt so old, but what fun would I be if I was falling asleep?

On Thanksgiving I woke up a bit early - I realized I had kind of forgotten to finish up the wreaths for the cemetery. I had 2 to finish and plugged in my hot glue gun and decided to take a shower while it was warming up. Only it never got warmed up. *OH NO!* I asked my mom to borrow hers and that turned into a mess.  She actually yelled at me, so I decided I wouldn't use hers and would just go buy another one.  Well, I realized what the problem was - the glue gun was plugged into the extention cord, but the extension cord wasn't plugged in. *draws zero on forehead*

Things did get better as the day continued though.

My aunt, uncle, grandfather, sister, mom, and I went to the cemetery and put the 6 wreaths on the graves.  I payed VERY close attention to where my grandfather's family was.  When I went to visit the graves over the summer, I couldn't find them. So hopefully the next time I go I'll remember.

For dinner, my aunt made garlic bread. I love garlic bread.  That made me very happy. ^_^ But what REALLY made me happy was that she made cheesecake for dessert. :P We didn't have turkey, yet I really enjoyed the meal....but isn't cheesecake one of those things that promotes happiness?

My uncle is really big on doing the daily crossword, which is where the ""pish"" comes from. :) He insists on finishing it and we came to a point were things just weren't fitting.  I don't remember the clue, but we originally thoughts the answer was ""posh""  then the ""o"" didn't fit.  We were down to 3 remaining clues when my aunt stepped in to ""solve"" it. She said just put a ""p"", to which my uncle said, ""Pish?!? Pish is not a word! You don't say that the eastern palaces are PISH! You don't say that extravagant vase your friend bought is PISH!"" I laughed so hard I almost peed in my pants.  

By the way, we realized we had one of the clues wrong.   The correct answer was ""rich"". ^_^'

I went home and made fudge for the potluck at work...which leads me to today...

Work started at 5am, but today the customers came in at 6am. Not that I minded that.  I, for the most part, really like my job.  What upset me was the front end supervisor and her attitude.  I was going to be a helper on the sales floor and could take over people's registers if they needed breaks and we were busy. Most people understood that, and the store manager even announced this at the morning meeting.  Well, she insisted on calling me up for stupid stuff and to ring on registers when the actual cashiers were just standing there.  After 3 hours of that, I just couldn't take it and told her to please call me when she needs me because I need to help people spend their money.  I was so upset I had to cool off in the back room for a while, which actually made some people laugh. They said they knew <i>she</i> had to be out of line if I was upset because I'm the most easy-going of the bunch.  How was I suppose to feel? No, I don't mind running register.  It's not the best part of the job, but I don't mind it. And I don't mind helping out.  But when I'm rushing to the front of the store and just giving people short answers because I think I'm needed at the front of the store, and I'm not, I'm just being called up there because she wants to show off her ""authority"", well geesh.  

I was really helping people spend their money too.  I took an inventory of what we had in the storage room, so when I saw we were low on something I went and filled it right away, and when one lady said she wanted 6 more of this one $25 garland I went in the back and got the box for her. ^_^ I was really good today.

But I said I wasn't going to do any shopping...and I lied to myself!

The breakdown happened because I was nice...

On Wednesday, they were going to throw out 2 of the displays.  Well, my mother said that she liked them, so I asked if I could buy them.  They said I could and I bought them both for $6.  My mother was very happy when I gave them to her, but then asked on Thursday if I could get the lights for her.  I told her she needed to come in the morning to get them, but she eventually asked if I would just do that on my way home.  So I stood in the long line and got her the darn lights to make the displays prettier.  After that, when my sister said she wanted to go shopping I figured why not?!

I only bought things for myself. Oops.

At the mall we were just walking and I saw this little box that had these 3 small fishes that were swimming around - and they weren't real! I thought it was cool and vey relaxing, so after thinking about it and passing the store 3 times, I just bought it. :) I feel like such a girl...I HAD to have something.  Geesh!

I also bought 2 CD's. I'm listening to Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper now.  I really like her new single ""breath"". Anyway, they were selling the CD single for $7.49 and the whole album for $9.99.  Does that make any sense? So I just bought the whole album and it's pretty good so far. ^_^

The other one I won't admit for fear of being stoned.

Then I was invited to a sleepover with friends, but I have to be at work at 5am the next morning, so I think I'll just stay for a couple hours instead.  Anyway, when my sister was looking at the toys, I saw this game called ""Imaginiff"" (I think that's what it was called) and it looked like so much fun - and was on sale too! So I bought that to bring. My sister and I played it and it was a lot of fun with just us, so I think it'll be even more fun with a bigger group.  I just have to remember to bring it. THAT'S the hard part. ^_^

And that was my holiday....hopefully next year things will be a little more exciting. *sigh*</lj-cut>"

"event","I was determined to have a good day and be in a goofy mood. 

Since my attempts are writing are non-existant, I was going to think of a title and each week put an update in my journal on my progress with how much I added (or didn't to each story). Something like this since I actually wrote them down thinking of the idea:

Silly Story (no title yet): 2,054
Romance (no title yet): 2,740
The Black Witch: 6,543
One Winged Angels: researching...

I went shopping today, found a beautiful sweater, 2 pair of boots, garbage bags (I needed them), some silly thing my mom was looking for, and about 9 pair of earrings for under $50.  I was happy.

So what's dampening my mood? My sister.  She should've been home 4 hours ago, and I haven't a clue where she is. 

I'm really worried too.  A few minutes ago, the UPS guy came to deliver a package and I stood for a moment praying a cop wasn't behind the door telling me about an accident.

She does this all the time.  I don't even know if I should be mad at her, or keep hoping she's safe."

I can't do anything right...more people leave my life on a regular basis than actually come in and stay for a while.  Pretty soon I'll be alone, all by myself.

To be honest, though, I've been feeling like that for a while now.   What happened to that spark that brought me joy for a while? I couldn't even hold on to that..everything's leaving me..."

And for the most part it was a beautiful today.  Unfortunately I happened to be watching TV a bit today, something I don't normally do.

So could someone tell me who really cares so much that Michael Jackson was on a plan or has been arrested?  Granted, I do care in the sense that if he really did what they are saying he did, he's an evil person and should be punished.  But do I really need to know what the status is every 10 minutes? The regular news doesn't even report on half the child molestation cases that are mentioned in the paper, so what makes this so special, just because it's Michael Jackson?  

I just don't get it.  I just think that in the case of a child being molested, each instance is equally evil and tragic. The fact that they are just singling this out so much because he's a celebrity is just upsetting."

"event","The only thing I'm happy about right now is that I didn't sign up for NaNoWriMo like I originally wanted to.  My writing experience for this month is about 3 pages - TOTAL. That's so ridiculously far from 50,000 I would actually quit right now if I signed up.

I've just been too upset. First I got sick and then had to take a major exam still with a major headache and sniffling. Then I managed to get in an argument with a friend and now he won't even respond to my emails, and if he does it's only to say he has nothing to say right now. 3 people at work are trying to hook me up with someone and that's just depressing me because it's almost like I'm a desperate and pathetic person and can't get a guy on my own.  I'm not even sure I WANT a boyfriend right now. I've also been working a terrible shift at work lately (5am to 1pm) and because of that my sleep schedule is so screwed up so when I want to try to go out with friends, guess who's sleepy at 8pm? ME! The fricking NIGHT OWL.  

I'm so confused and disheartened I don't even know what to do anymore.  Maybe I should pay more attention to this journal that I should...at least that way I could at least get some of frustration out even if I'm not being very productive."

I went out with some friends too - we all dressed up.  It was fun. :)

And none of us had boyfriends to worry about. *giggles* I guess being single again isn't so bad after all."

"event","After so many things have been going right in my life, I'm now faced with a situation I just don't know how to deal with.

A lot of things in my sister's life haven't been going well, and if I could I would transfer my recent good fortune to her in a heartbeat, but I can't. The final thing that is out of control for her I am trying so hard to fix, but I can't. I can't seem to do a damn thing to help the most important person in my life.

So what is this thing? Well, it involves a site called Neopets.

A few months ago, my sister's account was frozen because she was supposedly cheating on the flash game. I'm sorry, but I know this is just bullshit.  She had been earning a lot of Neopoints because she wanted to get 1,000NP of interest a day, and played games for at least an hour.  But it was all honest.  Besides, my sister and I use the same computer, and sometimes I use it right after she's logged off, and I play some of the flash games too.  My account has not been frozen. Of course, I usually only played 1 or 2 games and earned no where near as many Neopoints each day as she did.

So, she writes and writes and writes, and all they say is ""your account was frozen because you were cheating.  We have evidence"".  For the past 2 months, they haven't even replied to her messages - at all.  She's getting more and more depressed, and I don't know why, but she's focusing on her energy on this.  Loosing her Neopet, CheddarHead, seemed to make the beginning of her bad luck.  

Today she tells me if they don't reply within a week to help her get her Neopet back she's going to kill herself. 

I think it's a bit extreme to kill yourself over a Neopet, but she seems serious.  I don't want to tell our mom because I know my mom will only yell at her, and then my sister will be pissed at me.

I don't know what to do.  I just have no clue what to do. 

Does anyone have any advice?"

"event","No, I'm not dead yet, things are just a bit hectic right now - a good sort of hectic though. So, some highlights:

- receiving an email from a woman who said my poem about my grandmother's death helped her coup with her grandmother's death.

- finding out the people I work with feel I'm creative, talented, and perhaps most important (at least to me) dependable.

- feeling good about my first major accountint project. A little worried about the exam in that class, but am hoping for the best (I either understood everything or didn't have a clue.  The exam just seemed too easy to be anything in-between)

- finally became a reader for my parish...and heard a lot of people tell me I did a good job despite being nervous as hell.

- Learning I can make some good fried rice! ^_^

- finished putting together the gifts for my co-workers for Christmas, now I just have to finish the gifts for my family.

I'm hoping things calm down a little, but if not, at least I'm happy."

Like idiots, we both followed her orders (even off the clock! *gasp*) We both taught the personality profile was pretty cool, but neither of us had matches.  We laughed it off, telling people ""we're just too good for anyone.""

Well...today I checked my email and found out not only do I now have 4 matches, but 2 of them have already requested to start communicating with me. *dies* I'm so afraid to log in to the site again now.

What did I do? *sobs*"

Now, although he's the tinest, he's in the same unit as the other babies who are 4 pounds and over.

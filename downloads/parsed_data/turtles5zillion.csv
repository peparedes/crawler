""As Sadie you are rather serious-minded, responsible, and stable.
 
You have the gift of tact and diplomacy, and possess a charming, easy-going nature which endears you to others.
 
You have a serious desire to understand the heart and mind of everyone, and could be very effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.
 
This name also gives you a love of home and family, and as a parent you would likely be fair and understanding.
Although the name Sadie creates the urge to be reliable and responsible, we emphasize that it causes procrastination, lack of confidence, and the inability to realize your goals and ambitions.
 
This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses in the fluid systems, and worry or mental tension""

"event","The Meaning of Life:

There isn't one.  There can be meaning in life but there is no reason for it.  Life is a single spot of light in the vast expanse of the darkness of the universe. It is a splash of color on a dark canvas - something people spend their whole lives researching and interpreting, trying to find the motivation behind its creation and the symbolism in each stroke of color and each new element of texture... but the artist only painted it because it was there and he thought it would be fun.  He painted it because what else do you do when you're an artist and there's a blank canvas?  Life is that splash of color, more interesting than a universe without it, but equally as meaningless.  It isn't some mystery to be solved but a truth that transcends the need for explanation.  Life is worth living because it is, not because there's any reason for it.  The meaning of life is life itself.  We live because we do.  That is all."

"event","I woke up this morning to my worst nightmare.  They say you eat 8 spiders a year... and I'm pretty sure I woke up immediately after one climbed in my mouth.  Whatever it was got stuck in my throat.  I couldn't spit it out or swallow it no matter how many times I coughed or swallowed gulps of water.  I even tried to poison it with coke before I realized it was useless.  So I ran to the bathroom to see if I could dig it out with a toothbrush and realized one of the reasons I hate dorm life when I was greeted by a girl straightening her hair.  I took my time: went to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, etc. but I could see that she'd be in there for a while and I just couldn't bring myself to shove a toothbrush down my throat with her standing there next to me.  Brushing my teeth helped a little, at any rate it feels like it's a bit further down, but consequently I still have the nasty feeling of something clinging to life in the back of my throat.  I didn't know this could happen but I always feared that it would.  That's why I started sleeping on my stomach - to keep my mouth as closed as possible in my sleep.  I knew that a bug could easily go in my mouth and be swallowed but getting stuck is an entirely new level of gross.  Words cannot describe how nasty this is."

"event","Eternal sleep without dreams.  That's all it is.  Simple, easy.  Life goes on as a light goes out.  You drift back to where you came from, scattered across the stars; the centrifugal force of the universe pinning you to all the edges of existence - but you cannot return.  This life was so small, too quiet to be heard.  But it was all you had, and now you have nothing, are nothing but the unlimited potential to be something new, something so unlike yourself you will be unrecognizable but for the particles that explain that you once belonged here.  You had a place and must find it again, but you are not you, you do not remember all that you'd become and soon even your memory will disappear.  The lives you affected will be extinguished as yours was and it will all come to naught.  Life is meaningless, but death?  Death is as mysterious as the cosmos and just as terrifying - unlimited and irretrievable, the absence of all that is good.  Your life was a pinpoint on the unfathomable expanse of time and space, but its worth was beyond expression because for one brief moment, it was yours to do with as you wished...
...and you spent it waiting in line for orders that never ceased to keep you in a place you couldn't honestly call your own with an ever-expanding list of things you'd never finish, all the while the dream of a place you would never allow yourself to stray to still nags at the back of your mind trying to drag you out of the monotony of an existence structured for you by generations of those who, of all the games their unlimited potential could have driven them to play, chose to follow the leader.  The increasingly claustrophobic feeling of a coffin already closed around you as you stand in a crowded room with the scream rising in your chest getting caught in your throat as you remember your orders to leave this world as undisturbed as you found it pressures you to action - but what?  A rebellion manufactured by the same generations of lost children?  How can you find your way when everything from your birth to your death has been systematically determined for you already with so little room for deviation that you find you are not only trapped by it but dependent upon it?  There is no escaping the order.  No ""outside"" or ""inside"" the circle.  There is just what is and what can never be.  And inside you are screaming for escape, but with no where to go, no one can free you, you decide it's safer to stay silent and wait for the end which though you pray for its delay, will come all too soon."

"event","NO ONE EVER WATCHES DOCTOR WHO THE RIGHT WAY.
This is a frustrating fact of life I've come across.  I try to tell people the way to begin but no one ever listens.  OK, so if you're thinking of starting to watch Doctor Who, it is extremely important you know where to begin, because the episode you choose to watch first will color your opinion of Doctor Who forever.  You could start in 1963 with William Hartnell or you could start in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston or you could just pick one to watch randomly.  You could begin any way you want.  I'm just going to tell you what seems to work best and make the most sense.

If you prefer the original Star Trek with Kirk and Spock over the other series of Star Trek, start at the beginning of Doctor Who with William Hartnell in 1963.
For everyone else, start with the NEW series, SEASON 5 EPISODE 1.  And THEN when you've caught up to present-day Who, GO BACK and watch Season 1, Episode 1 of the NEW Doctor Who.  Why start in the middle of a series and back track?  I'll tell you:

1.	The newer seasons are better quality in effects, story, writing, etc. than the first season of the new series.
2.	Season 5 starts with a new Doctor, companions, everything.  There's no lingering bits of the past to confuse you.
3.	Once you've watched Season 5+, you'll WANT to go back and watch the old ones because the new ones are so good.
4.	If you start with Season 1 of the new series, you're going to think the whole show is cheesy and the Doctor is bipolar.  Don't do it.
5.	If you see David Tennant as The Doctor before Matt Smith, you are going to resent Matt Smith.  He doesn't deserve that.
6.	It's the right way to do it.

(This wasn't meant to be directed at you, Carla.  Dad started watching it today at my recommendation but he started with Season 1 of the new series :(  I wouldn't worry about it if it was just him, but I know Sue won't like it starting from there, so it's frustrating.)"

"event","Just watched the entirety of Firefly and the movie Serenity in like 3 days.  Needless to say, I liked it.  BUT SOMETHING SUCKS.  The only thing I knew about Firefly before watching it (besides its status as a scifi cult classic) was a particular scene I'd seen a long time ago on Youtube.  I distinctly remember a fairly attractive guy in what I'm guessing was his room in like a rectangular trench sort of thing that looked like it could've been a bed, but it was lower than the wood floor all around it and I think there were granite or stone walls in the trench.  He was writing on papers stuck to the wall and babbling like he was going insane but in between the nonsense you could tell he was extremely intelligent.  It had kind of a sad, kind of mysterious tone to it.  The camera kind of walks you into the room with a girl who's approaching the guy.  She's upset so you can tell his insanity is a new development.  That's how I remember the clip, anyway.  It's been a long time since I saw it.
Unfortunately, after watching the entirety of Firefly and its related movie, I now know this scene WAS NOT FROM EITHER.  This is extremely frustrating because I was looking forward to placing that scene in the right context.  If you could tell me what series or movie this scene is from, I'd be really appreciative."

"event","I think there should be a drug recycling program.  People should be able to return their unused medications to the hospital or an extension of the hospital.  It would save all kinds of money and cut down on prescription drug dealing/abuse.  A lot of people only sell prescription drugs because the only alternative is to just throw them out.  I think a recycling program would work.  All they would need is like one employee to dedicate specifically to the recycling program and one machine that can test the returned medication to make sure it hasn't been tampered with or anything.  Of course there would need to be a way to sort old medication from new medication, as there would undoubtedly be those stupid people who try to bring in expired medication.

I think this is a good idea because, at the very least, it would cut down on drug abuse and provide cheap drugs to those who need them.  If they couldn't prescribe these drugs to patients, at least they could prescribe them to people without insurance who really need them.  They could give them away for a fraction of the cost of even generic medication."

"event","Sometimes I think ""putting things in perspective"" just leaves you perpetually bored.  The trouble comes when you're so good at perspectivizing that you virtually can't get excited or surprised or have any real spontaneous emotions at all.  I'm pretty good at this.  ""Putting things in perspective"" may make some people feel better when they're overly upset about something, but is it really good to make passionate people placid?

This expression, ""putting things in perspective,"" has had a similar effect on me as the expression ""putting yourself in someone else's shoes.""  Both are supposedly positive expressions, used to alter a person's preconceptions of the world and other people.  For me, however, both have had decidedly damaging effects on my subconscious until I no longer have unprocessed emotions.  I feel like my expressions of emotion come from the desire to have them more than the actual presence of them.  I tend to exaggerate what I'm feeling because I'm not actually feeling that much.  And that's depressing.

And that's where I think my depression came from.  I don't think I grew out of it, I just decided it wasn't worth thinking about and moved on with my life.  While yes, that could be considered ""growing out of it,"" I still feel depressed underneath all of this ""moving on"" stuff.  My depression has never been anything more than despondency at finding my peers' interactions with each other incomprehensible and my inability to relate to them ultimately inherent - along with, of course, feeling the futility of fighting ultimate insignificance and the inability to stop fighting.  When I realize I'm not as quick to react to anything as I see most people react, or when I realize I smile more often because it's polite or I'm nervous than because I'm really happy, I realize this is still true of me.  When I feel detached from reality and my friends and the world, when my most recurring daydream is to run away leaving everyone I have ever met behind - knowing that would change absolutely nothing, but feeling restless and dissatisfied, and wishing for it all the same, it rings still truer.  This daydream, incidentally, isn't because I don't love my friends or don't think I would miss them, but because I'm bored and I'm tired and I feel like staying with the people I know makes me less of myself and more of the person they know.  I'm tired of that person.  It's not like I'd be a different person if I went somewhere else, but I dream about it, anyway.  I wish I were the kind of person who acted rather than considered acting.  I wish I weren't so cautious and responsible.  I wish I were a passionate nomad with close friends all around the world whom I may never see twice.  I'm not saying I want that, but I wish I were someone who honestly could.

Also, these exaggerated emotions of mine and delayed reactions where they should be natural make me awkward.  I've finally figured out that the reason I'm awkward whether or not I feel comfortable is that the timing of everything I do is naturally off.  Obviously, because a forced reaction is only forced after it's decided that it's the right way to react, which is usually by taking into account everyone else's reactions and carefully calibrating my own to match, as best I can.  This takes time.  Sometimes the time it takes for me to fake a natural reaction is enough to be noticed by the people around me.  This is only noticed in a very limited sense, like the back of your mind is trying to tell you something is off about me, but all you're conscious of is that that person over there is awkward.  Something off(but not a scary off, or at least a minimally scary off), subconsciously = awkward, consciously.

This calibration of reactions takes not only time, but energy.  This is why I'm an introvert.  I need to not be around people at times so I don't have to continue to display emotions I don't have, even the subtle ones - maybe especially those."

"event","I think I've discovered I don't believe in breaks.  I really don't like them at all.  I believe in slacking off, but I actually dread taking breaks.  Today we were in an interminable staff meeting about safety protocols and when they suggested breaking for lunch all I could do was hope it would be a 10 minute break instead of the 45 minute one they decided on.  I think the concept of breaks just totally escapes me.  I think if you're going to do something, you'd better do it all at once or you'll lose your resolve.  If not, slack off until you're ready to do it.  But don't stop in the middle of it and hope you have the motivation to pick it up again!  I used to try to make myself take breaks.  I've always heard it's a good idea to schedule breaks into your day so you don't get overwhelmed with all the work you have to do.  The problem is, I get more overwhelmed when I know I have to go back to something I started than when I have to finish something I'm working on.  I need momentum to work more than I need rejuvenation.  I know as soon as I take a break I forget all the information I gathered from before the break by the time I need to use it in the second half of my work.  I lose my train of thought easily.  It's much easier to hang onto a moving train than to let go and try to catch up to it."

"event","I woke up today after a 6 hour nap on the couch.  In the first few moments of waking, after I'd given up on returning to sleep but before I'd acknowledged it was time to rise, I glanced out the window, my eyes resting on the silhouette of a tree branch.  The branch, though nothing out of the ordinary, was more beautiful than anything I'd seen in months.  It was a moment of clarity, a moment in which the world was perfectly beautiful, not because it was anything special, but because for the first time in months, I could really see.  My eyes perceived a clear contrast between the black of the branch and the light of our neighbor's window.  I'd been waiting for something like this.

I think the hardest thing about growing up is noticing the alterations in perception that accompany aging.  I don't know if it happens to everyone or if they even notice if it does, but my mind has grown increasingly hazy and I often feel detached from reality.  I think this is owing, at least in part, to my fading vision.  As a child, my eyes were sharp.  I remember the first time I couldn't see the moon clearly, the first time I saw beams of light surrounding street lights.  My vision is still up to doctors' standards of perfection, but it is far from mine.  

But today, I saw a tree branch in the window, and for a moment the black was black, not a million tiny dots of dark purples and blues, but clearly black.  My vision for a moment or two felt like it used to, because my mind was clear for a tiny, random moment as I lay on the couch.  I couldn't decide what to do with that clarity.  In moments like this over the past few years, I've taken walks to my favorite spots in Goffstown, eager to use my few moments of true sight to see the places I admire for their beauty even when my sight is unclear and my mind hazy.  But living in the city, after the alarm has been set and it's past midnight, it isn't easy to find something especially beautiful to look at.

So this is what I decided to do, knowing full well that the computer screen often shortens these moments of clarity.  Because in times like these where my vision is clear, my mind is also, and in the choice between the two, this time I chose the latter."

Unfortunately I've become a rather lazy and incompetent writer, and tend to get distracted much more easily than used to be usual for me, so I can't repeat much.  

What I can say is I've stumbled upon a series of ideas that have reconciled for me what I believe to be true: God, heaven, salvation, good and evil, the Bible, etc., and what I perceive to be true: everything in existence is in a constant state of change, nothing lasts forever, but nothing can ever be completely created or destroyed; it simply changes forms.  

Unfortunately, I tend to communicate in a way only I really agree with, and I believe individuals have to discover their own ideas, beliefs, and understanding of the nature of existence in order to be fully satisfied with them.  Steal ideas from people, yes, but don't take on an entire system of belief just because you agree with parts of it.  I feel like a heathen for saying that, but I've never felt more at peace with the thought of death or the (even more scary and stomach churning) idea of eternity.

"event","Just a thought.  Kids are like drunk people: they're noisy, messy, and obnoxious, but you love them anyway.  They act out and you have to clean up after them.  They have no concept of personal space, don't listen when you give them limits, and they eat all your food.  They don't have great coordination or concentration, rely on you to tell them when they're being idiots, and they experience all their emotions with extreme potency.  In short, kids, like drunk people, are fun to have around on occasion, but I wouldn't want to live with them permanently."

"event","I have no special last requests or wishes other than that you refer to me as I am and think of me as I was.  When I die, I am not ""deceased,"" I have not ""passed on"" or ""passed away.""  I'm dead.  I have died.  Death should sound as harsh as it is.  I don't mind being dressed up, sewn together and displayed for all my surviving friends and relatives to stare at for a few hours, to give the illusion of dormant life for a period of time adequate for them to say goodbye, but after the coffin closes, the denial should not be perpetuated by easy language and misguided decorum.  Do the dead care that people are sensitive to their state of death?  People soften their language because it's easier for them to face their own mortality when it's phrased as transitorily as ""passing on;"" it's not for the benefit of the dead.  Yes, I've caught myself using these phrases to soften the impact of my words when conversing with someone whose loved one has died, but I know that I don't want people to do that for me.  When I die, if someone asks you if I'm deceased, or mentions that I've passed away, make sure you say ""yeah, she's dead.""  And if they insist on using the softer, more palatable word, insist on using the alternative.  I'm not interested in empty words and palliatives to make you feel better about my death.  I'm not planning on dying any time soon, but when I do, I want someone to make sure I'm dead.  Not ""deceased,"" dead.  It's my death; it's about me.  Except it's not, is it?  When someone dies, the commemoration of their death is never really about them.   It's about the people who shared an acquaintance with them finding consolation in each other.  It's about the stories they can tell and sorrow they may or may not feel at the loss.  Whenever someone dies, people immediately think about themselves in relation to the dead.  They think, ""s/he was so young!  I'm not ready to die... what if I'm next?"" etc. etc.  And I'm no exception.  Death is a personal thing nobody wants to experience, but since we don't know what happens, we always think of it in relation to  ourselves - our friends are missing from us and we will someday vanish as they did.  People inexplicably conclude that the best way to honor the dead is to barrage their loved ones and distant acquaintances with stale phrases of consolation that mean nothing to either well-wisher or griever.  IF ANYONE ENGRAVES THE LETTERS R.I.P ON MY GRAVE OR POSTS IT IN REFERENCE TO ME, PLEASE SLAP THEM IN THE FACE AS HARD AS YOU CAN.  That is not an empty suggestion- seriously, slap them.  R.I.P may have been necessary on ancient gravestones too small or cheap to fit more words, but in this day and age, it's only an abbreviation that makes words that represent little sentiment mean even less.  It's nearly disrespectful, in my opinion.  It's like you wanted to say something about the dead but really have nothing to say so you say the most cliche thing that takes the least amount of effort.  I believe the best way to honor the dead is to carry out their wishes in terms of ceremony and will (and in my case terminology), mourn them as authentically as you can, care for what they've left behind, and continue to live your life with a renewed sense of purpose, which comes from the necessity to confront one's mortality again.  The best thing you can do for the dead is to live more fully in reaction to their death."

"event","Well today's the day I'll tell you all my secrets
I've chosen now because it's as never was before
And if you say today is just like any other
Well you're wrong
I'll prove it to you

I've been playing with the fire in your veins
For so long
And of course you know I'd ought to say that I've burned
But see it's you who really need resuscitation
You say your heart will stop at my every word

Don't be naive
I know you're lying
When you say you want me for 
My personality...
Don't try to win my love
I'll always know you're trying
But I just want to be
Free

Tell me the truth
But don't be rude about it
Stay with me now
But don't you try anything
I've got all these rules for you
Because I'm afraid to let go

This is the end or the beginning
You know that's how it always works out
Yes, I might be afraid but don't think that weakens my resolve, at all
You know the feeling
When you hear exactly the right things
From the wrong lips

If you tell me that you love me
Don't ask me to respond
You know I'll never say the same
Unless I mean it
Thoroughly

I don't love you
Do I love you?
I don't love you
Don't I love you?
I don't love you
Love you, love you, love you, love
I don't"

I just read some of my old entries (from like middle school) and decided I was waay cooler back then.  I kind of suck as a human being now.  I'm pretty sure I was smarter and all around better back then...  despite the random laser-pointing, chip-eating, tape-recording, awkward-silence-inducing moments of mine, I actually had my good days.

also, I really miss all the people who made those days so good, and the people who put up with my nonsense.  I can't believe that was over 4 years ago.  I know that I will most likely never see most of those people again.  I am sad and generally nostalgic.  and freaking tired.

I want to elaborate, but it's 2am and I have to get up in 5 or so hours for work.  then I have a party to go to.  if i can make it.  it's another goodbye to some amazing people I never really knew but will always remember.  I miss people.  SO.  I'm just gonna leave it at that.  awesome."

"event","Why can't I concentrate???  I can't just sit down and finish something... ever.  If I could organize my thoughts as well as I can organize lists and rooms, I could finish stuff faster and have more stress-free time.  
Incidentally (speaking of stress), if you were a teacher and discovered, after trying to collect an assignment, that NO ONE (except one kid) even KNEW about the assignment; would you assume that the ENTIRE class was at fault or that YOU were at fault?  I think that assuming that you were right with that kind of evidence against you is really arrogant.  
OK, I had straight 100s in this one class (except for one 93), until one assignment (under that same scenario) screwed everything up.  It shot me down like 10 points on my overall grade.....  which is ridiculous.  I went from like a 98 or so to an 87...  umm?  why are some teachers out to screw their students' grades?  I'm not usually that paranoid, but when a teacher marks down an entire class to avoid admitting a mistake, I say it's time to do something about that teacher......  or something? meh."

Anyway, I didn't forget to tell about my awesome Chicago trip, I just needed.. time?  But it has been long enough and I think it's about time.  So:

THURSDAY

I went to the airport with Mom and Gram.  I was kind of expecting Mom to go with me, but apparently Gram came to make sure I didn't get lost or kidnapped or whatever.  It felt like they were sending me off to college- my college- and they were nervous for me.  So we had breakfast at the airport and then I was on my way to Chicago for the first time by myself.
I wasn't nervous at all until I got off the plane in Chicago.  Carla wasn't there yet and I couldn't find baggage claim for a while because the sign hadn't changed yet.  But I did finally find my stuff and Carla and we left.  We quickly stopped off at the dorm to drop off my stuff and then we went to Boston Market for lunch.  We rushed off to the student recital where I met Taryn and Josh and Cindy.  Then took the bus to dance class.  We played a lot of sudoku and the iPod music quiz while we were going places and waiting for things.  Dance class was fun, actually.  I was surprised because I liked it a lot more than my own dance class in New Hampshire.
  We went shopping at Wholefoods.  And then we ate dinner at the tables they set up after the cash registers.  IT WAS AMAZING.
  Then we took the bus back to North Park, which involved more sudoku and music quizzes (on Carla's iPod, not mine, because all my songs are stolen from her computer so she knows them all).  Then we waited a little in her room until we both wanted tea.  We went to Java Haus in search of Josh Johnson, but instead we found Matt and Guy.  Mostly Carla and they socialized while I played sudoku and laughed.  After Carla taught Guy how to play sudoku, Carla tore apart a styrofoam cup and threw it in another cup..  I guess you'd have to have been there.

FRIDAY

We woke up.  Carla went to a class or something while I stayed and watched Family Guy.  I got in the cafeteria for free (a one time thing) and we ate lunch.  I watched the Whole 9 Yards in the room.  Which was good.  Then we walked to Jewel and called my parents and grandma after discovering how many times they had tried to call me already.  We then went to Evanston (eee!) for Blick, PITA PETES!!, and TCBY.  
Then we went back to NPU for the opera (<u>Gianni Schicci</u> and <u>The Medium</u>), which was actually my favorite thing we did while I was there.  It surprised me a lot because I never thought I'd like an opera (especially MORE than Pita Petes!).  I met a billion of Carla's friends there.  Seriously.  Then we played Scrabble in Java Hause with Josh and 2 people who really didn't want to play Scrabble, which was fun until it wasn't..

SATURDAY

We slept in.  We went to lunch with Josh and Kasey and Taryn and.. other people.  Then I read a letter Carla had written to me.  That took me like an hour (hey, it was like 10 pages or something).  I read it on the El when Carla was talking to her friend Mike and his friend Ted.  It was really crowded.  We went to the planetarium where we saw a ton of awesome exhibits and a kinda-funny sky show.  Then we went to Evanston for dinner at Cosi's (I'm definitely going there for dinner next time I go to Evanston) and we had dessert at Cold Stone Creamery (also amazing).  Then we got tired.  We watched Wayne's World and we watched part of Spinal Tap with Cindy and Darrin until I fell asleep.

SUNDAY

We got up late and rushed to shower (it was the first time I'd ever showered anywhere besides a... house.  interesting..)  and rushed to church.  We were still really tired and almost fell asleep in church, but we woke up a little more when we went to brunch.  I've never seen so many people get so excited over grapes before.  Then I packed and SUDOKUed.
  Then we left and walked to the bus stop in the rain.  Unfortunately we forgot to get my id from the desk and had to run back to the dorm.  We did, but now we had no extra time.. or so we thought.  We took the El to the airport and Carla must have waited with me at the gate for an hour before they announced the plane was delayed because of the rain.  So after a while of this nonsense, Carla left to get her paper written.  I did a lot of sudoku.  This guy started to ask me about it and I tried to teach him how to play sudoku without standing too close to him.  I don't like to talk to weird men at airports by myself.
  But eventually we took off and I got to watch the sunset from the airplane.  Unfortunately, the sun was usually blocked by clouds.  But when it wasn't, it was the most indescribably beautiful thing I have ever seen.
  And then I was home."

all this week is my school's ""Spirit Week,"" meaning that monday's ""nerd day,"" tuesday's ""crazy day,"" wednesday's the day we get to torture our senior slaves, thursday is uh.. spirit day? and friday is ""decade day"".

Nerd day, as the name implies, is the day in which everybody at school will be dressed as a nerd (whether they wear the uniform or not), and the day I get to pick through mom&Carla's clothes to find nerdy stuff.  Also, I love watching Mark and Josh dress up as nerds, 'cause they're so good at it..
shut up, Carla, I don't wanna hear any of your ""you're an even bigger nerd"" crap.

So anyway I'm wicked excited.
And I finished my new nancy drew game in under a week.  yay?

and that's all."

My dad bought me a digital camera and a printer for Christmas (which we celebrated on New Years Eve), and Karen and Lindsay bought us (Josh, Mark and me) those chairs with speakers and stuff.  really expensive stuff mind you.  Paul bought us all walmart gift cards and Mom bought us too much stuff to list off.  I'm still really amazed at my camera!  I mean.. it's really really good..

but anyway, I had a good Christmas/New Year (excluding the party going on next door at the condo).  Today was supposed to be our first day of school after Christmas break, but we [triplets] had a dentist appointment.  I have no idea what to do with the rest of the day."

"event","So... it's Christmas Eve in one hour.  hmmm.  I've been so busy for the past.. err.. year that all the important stuff passes me by before I have a chance to think twice about it.  Usually by this time of year I've decorated the entire house, listened to Christmas music endlessly for at least 2 weeks, and been tempted to open the presents early at least once.  But this year I haven't had time to even think about Christmas, let alone continue my Christmas traditions.  Not to mention they haven't shown any of the good Christmas specials on tv.

In other news, I'm getting my hair cut tomorrow (with Carla if you didn't already put that together).  It's pretty weird that I'm more excited about that than Christmas, though.. I mean, it is my favorite holiday..  I think I'm tired, so naturally I'm gonna go watch one of those Jason movies instead of going to bed.  Happy Christmas everybody."

"event","None of my friends can come to my party.  I invited 6 people, and only 2 said they can come.  It makes me really sad.  Luckily, Michelle can come, and Liz, who I don't know if she's my friend at all anymore or if our friendship has declined back to the point where we're merely acquaintances, can come (sorry; still in the book report-writing mood).  Supposedly, all the rest of them - Sarah, Rachael, Cooney, and York are going to a basketball game.  Even my backups in case anyone couldn't come are on the basketball team..  It's gonna be a party with 10 boys and 5 girls if conditions don't improve.  This wouldn't have bothered me if I was friends with any of them, but I'm only friends with Merritt and Tyler.  Josh, at least, is friends with almost all of my friends.

But about the rest of my life (which I swear I do have), the only report I have yet to write is the one on Mozart, and I'm really happy about that, because it took me the entire long weekend to finish the other ones.  The science one is being done in class.  

I hate it when teachers try to pry into your personal life by saying, ""I want to learn more about you,"" and then telling you to write down the answers to questions like, ""What is the greatest challenge you are facing now?"" etc.  If you want to know more about me, all you have to do is ask, but please don't expect me to spill my guts to someone I don't know anything about.  I also hate it when teachers say, ""You must be at the concert, or I will give you a failing grade,"" (this particular concert is worth a quarter of our over all average) and then tells you he's not going to be there.  My mom is going to be the director, which doesn't bother me, but I hate contradiction, especially in a teacher.  Especially in one who expects you to call him ""Pastor.""

One thing I'm finding out about parents is that they know pretty much everything about you, but you know nothing about them.  This only bothers me, because I'm beginning to see how many secrets they're both hiding, some of which I don't want to know, and others that would have been really helpful to have heard about... but I'll save that speech for another time.  It's time for me to go do my homework."

I love you Sarah; thanks for being the only person (not including the usuals(Joe, Merritt,...)) to not have done it yet.

I really want to go to bed right about now, but I can't bring myself to turn off the computer without having finished my assignment (even if I'll only get a 64 at best).  I can't figure out if I'm a perfectionist, obsessive compulsive, or if I'm just an idiot.  I really wish someone would help me...

4. I'm sitting in my mom's room
5. I was determined to eat healthy today until I went to putnams
6. I still haven't called Kennedy and I feel badly about that
7. I just played the longest scrabble game of my life last night
8. I was just asked a question on math homework that I actually knew the answer to
9. I forgot my neopets password
10. My least favorite teacher teaches english
11. I still haven't done my homework
12. I have a fieldtrip on monday
13. I played more ddr today than I have in the past month
14. I forgot to give my friend her notes on friday, so I took them home
15. I asked mom for carrots because I want to forget about eating half a snowball
16. I was secretly mad at Carla for taking the scale because I can't be obsessive any more
17. I skipped youth group to hang out with carla yesterday
18. I only have 4 lj friends
19. I think I just used being tagged as an excuse not to post again later
20. I'm not exactly sure how long that took me

but I think it was somewhere between 7 and 8 minutes :( oh well.

because i have only 4 lj friends... 
I don't know if you can tag people who have just been tagged or who tagged you, so i won't.  this one stops with me."

"event","I've decided I like math tests.  Not only does it waste 45 minutes of valuable class time, but it also usually means less/no homework.  Of course, today is the exception.  It would seriously be on the top of my list of ""favorite"" classes if it weren't for the amount of homework every night.  I've decided to put today's math homework because I don't have math tomorrow because Friday's the best and the only ""real classes"" I have are Science, History, and French.. those aren't exactly my favorites, but there are 6 1/2 hours of school and only 3 hours of real classes.  Pretty awesome if you ask me.  I love Fridays."

Oh yeah!  And Dad visited and said he had a good time in Chicago and stuff.  Which is good, but I was mainly really happy he visited because I miss him and it made me feel like life was normal again.  Although, I was kind of... distressed? when he said he was bringing the golf cart to the lake and then proceeded to rip it apart, but I guess that's... okay?

I really wish my immune system would hurry up and start working again, because I have been sick for almost 3 weeks straight and I don't like it.  Also, every time I'm well enough to visit my Grandma, she's either not there or I'm not here."

"event","I'm exhausted.  Every period of the day took all of my self control to a) stay awake and b) stay in class instead of standing up and walking out of the room.

I woke up at 4:50am this morning.  Instead of just getting out of bed, I decided to fall asleep again.  Naturally this means I couldn't get myself out of bed at 5:00, when I'm supposed to get up.  So I was really late getting out of bed and that means I made everyone wait for like 10 minutes while I got ready.  I hate that.

Bible class was okay, I just don't really remember what we did in it..

English was boring, and I remember even less of that than I did Bible.

I was falling asleep in Science class, which may have been how I was able to stab myself so a huge gash was left in my finger which still hasn't stopped bleeding..

blah blah blah, No one would shut up in French class, so we didn't get candy, blah blah blah, I got a really bad grade on homework in Algebra 1 and it made me really mad, blah blah blah, I'm beginning to loathe Mr. Denton (who, though he may want to be, will never be Mr. D., nor will he be our man Denton.  you'd have to meet him to understand), blah blah blah, History class is more like Calvary class, Science is more like History class,  blah blah blah.

There is one good thing though.  The only homework I have is optional (though I'm still gonna try to finish it for extra credit, cause I need it) so even if I don't finish it I don't kill my grades!!  I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight!! I'm so excited!!

Mark was trying to convince me that we should sell the ps2 for the ps3.  NO.  I didn't really care at first until he said, ""the only thing is you'd have to get a wireless ddr pad.""  Why is there always a catch?  So Josh and I were strongly against it, which is good.
Josh: Mark, I'm not gonna let you sell it
Mark: too bad, I'm gonna sell it anyway
Josh: you can't, I own half of it

oh, details. :)"

I was really immature for a long time.
I don't know how mature I am now.
Certainly more than I was.

I'm having a baby.
If anyone reads this...
You've learned this information elsewhere, I'm sure.
I'm now married, I love it.
Honestly, I couldn't be happier.
It's wonderful.
I even make him lunches for work. hehe
Our baby is due November 4.
It's a girl, we're  going to name her Marlee.
As of right now, anyway.
We're not sure of a middle name though.
We're going to be getting a house soon.
Also, a new car.
We have a few things to pay off before we want to start worrying about loans though.
It'll be about two months or so.
We're actually doing quite well.
I'm pretty pleased with my life.

Christopher and I broke up several months ago, I was tired of his shit.

I knew him in highschool.
He doesn't beat me or mistreat me in anyway, it's pretty amazing.



Michael comes home tomorrow and I'm pretty fucking pumped about it.

"event","Well, I haven't updated in a while, I've been so unsure of myself lately guys...I don't know where to start, first of all, I love Cheeto ya know? But I keep feeling like we should break up. But everytime I get ready to break up, I realize something, if I saw him with another girl it'd kill me. So, I must love him, then I think, my family says he's my true love, so they will probably gripe at me. Who cares? I don't know what I want, I see my ex and somehow I wish he would just kiss me and we could run right? Real far, and I could be with him because that is what I want...but I don't want Cheeto to look for someone else, so I'm just not sure right? No, I'm not....So Eric told me to just be happy for him, so I will be, I will shut up, leave him alone, and let him live his life, after all, I've screwed it up enough already right? And to suddenly decide that I need him very badly, is just something I should keep to myself. Well, thats my entry for today and laterz people.

"event","Hi! Welcome to my journal! I'm a doll maker as you may all well know! I don't want to put my real name because I have a pyscho ex beau. So you may call me Clockeh. Sounds stupid but what can I do? Anyway, welcome to my journal. Today is my first day on this name! Can you believe it? I've had other names but well...Today I started and finished a catwoman doll. The Halle Berry version. I might try the older version later. Second of all, I'm TRYING to finish my degrassi ladies dollz. Be patient with me. Because I don't feel so well today! I dunno why. Flu I think because my nose is icky and all kinda crap like that. I'm just telling you ahead of time that I own manners, know what they are, but sometimes I don't use them, I will try not to curse because some people don't like stuff like that, but if it slips forgive me. 

Today was a normal day, well anything associated with me is not normal. I slept over at my mums house because I live in her second house right behind her and my boyfriend, Bobbeh said that it would be a good idea to sleep here at my moms house, in my moms friend's room. They were gone for the night, I didn't really like the idea but I did it. Well, they came back early this morning and woke me up that pissed me off pretty dang bad. Cuz I want to wake up when I want to wake up, not when someone else wants me to wake up. So I went back to my house and fell back asleep, but then it got too hot so I had to get up anyway and come to my moms house. Because we only have two fans and one of them works like crap. I came back to my mom's house because she has a water cooler and its a little bit cooler over here than it is over there. Anyway I spent most of the day over here because we watched catwoman and afterwards I decided to make a catwoman doll because she kinda looked cool. But I need to go work on my Degrassi dollz so I will talk to you laterz!"

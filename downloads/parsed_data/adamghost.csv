"event","I received my disposition yesterday from the IRS.

A thorough examination of books reveals that I owe them, with penalties and interest, a whopping $169.

Ha-ha.

Now that I know what they look for in an audit, I expect to get that back -- with interest -- on my 2004 tax return.

Your Republican government at work, helping those small business owners and cutting government waste.  God bless 'em."

"event","So I took the day off today because my brother and half-sister were going to be in town for Christmas and my brother had encouraged me to come down and meet them in Yorba Linda (60 miles across L.A. traffic from where I live).

I get to the address I was forwarded about this gathering, and when I get there I'm greeted by my half-sister's sister (who I've never met) and her husband.  Both very nice people, by the way.  They informed me that neither my brother nor my half-sister were there, and that my brother had taken his daughter to Universal Studios, having said that he wasn't sure if I was coming, that he hadn't heard from me all week, and ""well, if Adam isn't here by 10 a.m. he isn't coming.""

This despite the fact that I had e-mailed him saying that I had gotten the day off, that I was going to be away all weekend, and that I would be there no earlier than early afternoon.  Needless to say, I was pissed off...even more so when I got caught in the rain during rush hour on the way home.

It gets worse.  Bro finally calls me -- having belatedly gotten my number from my mom -- and rather than apologizing, lays into me for not having called the hosts -- who I didn't know -- to let them know I was coming, and also that I should cut him slack because he had a 7 year-old girl with him, and that plans sometimes change very quickly.  I pointed out to him that I'd told him when I was coming, that I had the day off, and that I only thought I had to call ahead if I was NOT coming.  This quickly degenerated into a screaming match, with me doing most of the screaming.  On relection, certainly I could have kept in better touch with the rest of my family.  But more to the point, so could he.  And I had showed up exactly when I said I would.  He didn't even leave a note...""I'm not going to sit there all day and leave a note when I have a 7 year-old kid to take care of.""  Please.

My mom suggested that I not speak to him until I get an apology.  It's clear from tonight's conversation that that won't happen.  So there it is.

The rest of my weekend -- spent in the desert -- was wonderful.  How was yours?"

"event","Can you believe it...I got audited by the IRS last week for my musical expenses.

I had my books in order (mostly), and the lady was nice (mostly) but I found the experience pretty grating.  Particularly annoying was the part where they add up your living expenses and compare it to what you claimed on the IRS return and tell you you couldn't possibly live on that.  I had to point out that the difference between my actual expenses and my mileage deduction for that year was $9,000 before she left me alone.  I mean, hell, I'm not the tax accountant.  SHE is, ya know?

Anyway, word to the wise to the other musicians:  they're coming after us.  It was clear from our conversation that I was not the first player to sit in the hot seat.  I expect to get through relatively unscathed but she made me give up, for one thing, the name of every person I kicked down $20 to at a gig for that year, which I find ridiculous.  Not that she's going to come after every one of them (and they all could find offsetting expenses without much trouble), but that's a pretty onerous requirement for the world of rock 'n' roll.  As she said, ""we're trying to get all the musicians to act more like a business.""  Great.  Very rock 'n' roll.

Another tip:  having a receipt in and of itself is not enough.  They want to see a receipt with someone's SSN or EIN (or something that looks official and corporate) AND proof that you paid it, either with a check or credit card statement.  If your buddy just scrawls something on a piece of paper for that guitar you bought, they're either going to disallow it or make you give up your buddy's SSN.

Fun, fun, fun..."

"event","It's been three weeks since I got home from tour and a week since the election, and I have no idea where I'm at.  I feel like I want to be around people but at the same time don't want to feel pressure to socialize.  I find it easy to go out for a drink in a crowded room but difficult to answer an e-mail.  I'm probably burnt out from caring about things -- the state of this country on a macro level and my own career on a micro level -- and I need a little time to recharge.  I'm grateful for the people that care about me and ask how I am, but sometimes it's hard to think of a good answer, so I just don't.

The one thing I feel like doing is playing a lot.  I've been dropping off packages here and there and I think it will happen.  The band went down to San Diego last weekend and had a good time in front of a small crowd.  I was still irritated about the election and rather unprofessionally vented spleen onstage all through the show.  But it felt good.  At the end of ""Deus Ex Machina"" I hurled my guitar across the room and cracked the headstock.  I'm sort of happy about that.  I broke something.  My anger mattered.  That's something to hold onto, anyway."

"event","I really have to salute the people who blog on a regular basis.  I wish I could muster up that kind of energy, particularly when I'm really busy.  It's not that I don't have anything to write about...it's that there's often too much to write about and I'm so busy living it that I don't have time to write...and who's gonna read it anyway?

But more than that I wish I had time to READ more peoples' blogs.  I find as I get older I get more interested in other peoples' stories and less in my own.  And it's also politically and spiritually a nice thing to do.  One of the things I most enjoy about setting up tours is the pretext to check in with people and say ""hey, how are you?""  And the bad thing is invariably I don't have enough time to do it properly.  This upcoming tour is no exception, although I have had time to drop a few notes here and there, but it's just made me long to have more time to really focus on what other people are doing.

Just getting my own shit together has been hard.  I try not to think about the enormity of the new album, but I do marvel that most of the stuff is getting done...four promotion people, 800 CDs mailed out, a national tour booked, travel logistics for five people, rehearsals, sideman shows, record release party to organize...I'm sure all of this stuff is not very interesting to read about but the maddening thing is, even though I'm pleased that I'm finally going to have a record that has a shot at being heard, it takes me away from the two things about music that are really important:   playing and meeting/hanging out with people.

I've had three gigs in as many weekends, all of which have been real high points.  Three weeks ago, it was being a background vocalist at the ""Pop 'n' Sizzle"" showcase put on by various people in the Beach Boys' axis, and which gave me an opportunity to lock harmonies with sidemen that backed the BBs for years and to sing backup for two of the Beach Boys' sons...and to offer assistance on the live debut of Alan Boyd, an old friend and talented musician who is also the Beach Boys' tape archivist and the person who brought me in.  It was a wonderful night and I really enjoyed meeting that challenge and performing songs that meant a lot to me.  In some ways it was an archetypal moment.

The following weekend, the Chaos Band had its last show before the record release party and much to our surprise, the L.A. WEEKLY made it pick of the week, the first time that's happened to me in four or five years.  The room was packed, including many folks I hadn't seen in ages, and the band continues to grow by leaps and bounds.  I am tremendously excited to bring these guys on tour, and I found my pulse quickening at one of my own shows for the first time in a long time, because I smelled an interest and momentum long absent.  I'm not planning to get too caught up in it, because I know how ephemeral that feeling is.  But it was nice.

Then last weekend Stew asked me to be a part of his Cover Problem extravaganza in downtown L.A.  This was a salute to L.A. music with many musical guests including John Doe and Stan Ridgway and in true Stew fashion it was a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants gig with plenty of humorous genre-bending exercises (e.g. ""Hotel California"" to the tune of ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"").  A highlight was an impromptu chorus including Darian Sahanaja and Nelson Bragg from Brian Wilson's band; I joined in with them and we lucked into one flawless four part harmony after another...really quite stunningly cool.  The high point for me was when Stan Ridgway came onstage and did a totally off-the-cuff version of the Seeds ""Pushin' Too Hard"" in his droll, deadpan beat poet style.  I was just watching the guy in awe, pinching myself that I was able to be a part of it and not fucking it up!  One of my 20 or so favorite onstage moments.  Almost as cool was harmonizing with Michael Quercio doing ""So You Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star"" and Kristian Hoffman's ""Unknown Soldier.""  It was also great to catch up with Darian and Probyn (who also played in the Cover Problem that night) and other friends long absent.

I really don't know what's about to happen, but I feel good that my musical life is slowly getting richer, more interesting, and more rewarding.  And that can't be bad.

In the meantime, only three weeks, a thousand e-mails, a hundred phone calls, and a dozen trips to Kinko's 'til YOU DON'T KNOW ME comes out."

"event","It's been a stressful month on this end.  I'm working a lot of the time, and gearing up for the record release is just a ton of work.  It's the most promotional effort that's been put behind one of my albums in years, and while that's nice, it requires a lot of energy on my part spent on things I don't really enjoy.  One of them is waiting for people to return one's e-mails when setting up a tour.

One of the neatest things that's been going on is watching the DVD come together.  The footage from the live show is great, and Evie's producing the soundtrack recording.  Unfortunately, the ADAT was recorded too hot so cleaning up the sound files has been time consuming and that's delayed things.  But it's coming together great.

Another neat thing is that the movie ""Finder's Fee"" -- which prominently features a Cockeyed Ghost tune in the soundtrack -- has finally surfaced and is making the rounds on Showtime and The Movie Channel.  So that's nice too.

I guess I'm just not the most patient person in the world, if it comes right down to it."

"event","<P>A lot of activity the past couple weeks...<BR><BR>Memorial Day weekend I had to get up at 2:45 a.m.(thanks to John Perry's direction!) to shoot the second video for the new album, for a song called ""My Kickass Life."" &nbsp;The reason for the early awakening was to get the light of sunrise out in the desert, which we did.&nbsp; The shots came out great but it was freezing out there.</FONT></P>
<P>The song is an autobiographical one and the video consists of location shots all over Southern California interspersed with old footage from the Cockeyed Ghost days and before. &nbsp;Amazingly, we got every shot we needed for the video by 5 p.m., including the Mojave Desert, Angeles Crest, the Santa Monica Mountains, Sunset Boulevard, Santa Monica Beach and the Veteran's Cemetery in West L.A. &nbsp;Things were so quiet over the holiday weekend that we were able to park right next to the beach. &nbsp;It was a perfect day weather-wise too. &nbsp;<BR>I cannot wait to see this when it's finished.&nbsp; I think it will actually look like...a video!<BR><BR><FONT size=4><STRONG>My Dorky Life</STRONG><BR></FONT><BR>Going back through old video footage for use in he video I was distressed to see how often over the years I put myself in situations where the probability looking bad was high. &nbsp;Often this was dictated by circumstances beyond my control, but it made me understand better why the Cockeyed Ghost thing escaped a lot of people that I would have expected to get into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>It made me glad that the focus for the last year or so has been on presentation and doing fewer things well, and it's made me doubly determined to keep the focus on that as things ramp up for the new album and tour (which is always a challenge when you have to attend to the business side as well). &nbsp;By the way, it's starting to look like most of the L.A. band is going to be able to go on the road with me, which will be pretty amazing if it happens.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT size=4>Big Rock</FONT></STRONG></FONT></P>With a break over the holiday, I've&nbsp;been going&nbsp;out most nights and seeing who's playing in the L.A. clubs, which probably explains why my ass feels totally kicked today. &nbsp;Bass player Teresa and I headed to the Joint to see our old friends Bat Country -- who are really evolving in an interesting way -- and afterwards a band called the Daylight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>By their facial hair and jeans-and-T-shirt clothing style they were looking to be a generic southern rock band and I remarked wryly to Teresa that ""it doesn't look like they'll be playing British art rock."" &nbsp;Then they started up and were playing...British art rock. &nbsp;And quite skillfully, too. &nbsp;I had a good laugh at my own expense from that.<BR><BR>I was more into a woman who played two dreamy indie rock tunes on an acoustic guitar before the Daylight played...I was impressed in that&nbsp;despite&nbsp;being physically nowhere near what one expects from a frontperson, she still projected natural star power.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't remember her name but she was somehow related to one of the members in the Daylight and if I get to see her again I will report on it.<BR><BR>Last night I was down in Long Beach at an all ages place to check out another band I had recently met, <STRONG>The Lost and Found</STRONG>. &nbsp;Two girls up front, guy in back, mixing garage rock with unusually vulnerable lyrics, a mix that I can particularly relate to. &nbsp;They have a new CD and I picked one up although I haven't listened to it yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>Also on the bill were <STRONG>One A.M. Radio</STRONG>, who were very impressive...two guitars, bass, string section and I-Book playing will-of-the-wisp music with great reverence and self-effacement. &nbsp;They pulled it off to the delight of the attentive, mostly teenaged audience. <BR><BR>In the crowd I ran into the gang from <STRONG>Helicopter Helicopter</STRONG>, recently relocated to L.A. but I hadn't seen them yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were standing behind me and it was one of those double take moments. &nbsp;They were there to see an ""emo band"" called <STRONG>Roy</STRONG> who they recommended highly but I was too wiped out (and the room was too hot) to stick around.<BR><BR><FONT size=5><STRONG><FONT size=4>Rarities Vol. 2</FONT><BR></STRONG></FONT><BR>Yesterday I was in the studio with Brian Frazee to wrap the mastering on the second Cockeyed Ghost Rarities CD, which is going to be a part of the deluxe CD/DVD package that hopefully will raise some funds for the main album release in the fall.<BR><BR>The Rarities Vol. 2 CD came out much better than I expected, as it has some of my favorite tracks we ever cut, including two covers that we&nbsp;expended a lot of effort on: &nbsp;""Walk On By"" and ""Back On My Feet"".&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>There's a really good stretch in the middle of the CD from the SCAPEGOAT era where the band started to experiment and cut things in the studio that didn't get on the album...a song called ""I Will Fight No More Forever,"" which was intended for a movie stands out for me even though I didn't think much of it at the time. &nbsp;The later part of the CD gets a little goofy but hopefully maintains some charm...by LUDLOW 6:18 the stuff we released got pretty dark so Rarities does a good job of representing the goofy side of the band at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>We managed to rescue a song called ""Happy Fooking Birthday"" from a live tape...the performance is good and the song is decent too. &nbsp;We also discovered something called ""Woody For You"" which is...well, kind of funny.<BR><BR><FONT size=4><STRONG>Fist Rock</STRONG><BR></FONT><BR>Robbie Rist (or as I like to call him ""Fist"") dropped off a CD with me on Friday of 10 songs I have to learn by Thursday to play with him at the Derby...sweet revenge for that guy <BR>considering how many times he's bailed me out on last minute live gigs. &nbsp;One of the songs is the B-side of his new single, which happens to be the first-ever released cover of a Cockeyed Ghost tune, ""Special."" &nbsp;Robbie did a good job with it, <BR>interesting to hear someone else do your song. &nbsp;The A-side, ""Luvotomy"" is a pretty fucking disturbing pop tune...it's about asking someone to cut your dick off. &nbsp;Jeez, Robbie!<BR><BR>The show should be fun though...it'll be the first time me, Robbie and Tony have played together in years, and Ellen from Piper Downs (one of my favorite people) is on drums.</FONT><BR><BR></P>

<P>Saturday was the day of the mammoth party-cum-video shoot at my house.&nbsp; The objective was to use the party as a backdrop for a video of my song ""What the Hell"" from the upcoming CD.&nbsp; John Perry directed and mapped out a storyline, and shooting began about noon.&nbsp; The song's more or less an anthem to random sex, and much of John's storyline revolved around the idea that I am a slut.&nbsp; (This seems to be a pretty prevalent idea 'round the web these days)&nbsp; With this in mind much of John's shots involved women leaving my bedroom.&nbsp; Fortunately, I'd just gotten clean sheets from Target.</P>
<P>The partygoers started showing up at 6 p.m. with the bulk arriving around 9:30.&nbsp; The idea was to use various partiers in interwoven storylines to the main theme, which was basically debauchery.&nbsp; Various couples made out on camera, and things got more and more out of hand until by the time we got to the ultimate shot -- the band playing in the garage -- things were decidedly Bacchanalian.&nbsp; People were falling over, groping each other, throwing shit...</P>
<P>I think it's gonna be a great video.</P>
<P><STRONG>Dean in Jam</STRONG></P>
<P>Well-known local behind-the-scenes music guys Vann Frazier and Dean Abramovitch helped John with the filming.&nbsp; A rather dazed-looking Dean showed up and informed us that he had just been sprung from the Van Nuys lockup, where he had spent two and a half days!</P>
<P>Apparently, Dean (his nickname is ""Dean Dean the Taping Machine"" for his hobby of archiving local band performances) was busted by the RIAA-funded vice squad.&nbsp; Dean has spent every Sunday for years heading to the swap meet and selling videos.&nbsp; We're not talking packaged bootlegs here...we're talking about tapes of live shows, audience shots, TV captures, that kind of thing.</P>
<P>When the vice squad showed up, they handcuffed Dean and then took every last CD and video tape he owns...not just the bootleg stuff, but the factory-manufactured CDs and videos he'd legally bought, and the hundreds of tapes and CDs of local bands that he'd recorded (with our permission) over the years, one of which had&nbsp;the only recording of an unreleased Cockeyed Ghost song we'd been planning to use on the upcoming RARITIES VOL. 2 CD.&nbsp; Then they threw Dean in the lockup until he could post the $2,500 bail.</P>
<P>I'm going to be posting Dean's address in the next few days -- while contributions to Dean's legal fund would be welcome, donations of punk rock CDs would also be a thoughtful gift.&nbsp; For a music lover, losing all&nbsp;your CDs is a major tragedy.</P>"

<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Three Weeks at Taix</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>I've spent the last three Saturdays playing at Taix Restaurant -- first with Mark Fletcher's <STRONG>Skip Spenc</STRONG>e tribute, then drumming for <STRONG>Spooky Pie</STRONG>, then finally with <STRONG>Adam Marsland's Chaos Band</STRONG>.&nbsp; I love that room and it's been a great stretch covering so much ground.&nbsp; All the shows went excellent and with good turnout.</P>
<P>Saturday's was the best Chaos show yet (except for the soul show last November); as Evie put it, ""some real moments of inspiration.""&nbsp; Teresa's a welcome (and hot!) addition and the band was just smoking with the harmonies.&nbsp; For the first time we're allowing ourselves to settle into the material -- as opposed to learning 10 new tunes for every show -- and we're ""finding new places to go with the songs as we go on"" (Evie again).&nbsp; </P>
<P>I love the fact that I'm playing music that manifestly&nbsp;isn't trying to be, it just is.&nbsp; I don't know if that makes any sense.&nbsp; But it feels good up there just playing and not trying to beat everyone over the head with it.&nbsp; Letting it come to me.</P>
<P>The Chaos Band's performances have&nbsp;been inspiring enough to me so that I've been able to re-commit to -- if not proselytyzing the music, than at least being motivated to share what we're doing.&nbsp; The pace is accelerating with more shows and three different releases being planned for later in the year (two CDs and a DVD).&nbsp;Having&nbsp;pretty much abandoned my year-long attempt to find some sort of a normal life,&nbsp;I've been out in the clubs all week, hanging out, watching bands, even passing out a flyer or two...although my days of harassing everybody in the bar are long gone.&nbsp; Bands I've seen this week include <STRONG>Texas Mafia</STRONG> (Sonic Youth-y reverby rock), <STRONG>The Golden Dawn</STRONG> (a middling '60s psychedelic band that's on a reunion tour), <STRONG>The A-Frames</STRONG> (way loud, monstrous riffs, like a Kraut-rock punk band), <STRONG>October </STRONG>(femme singer-songwriter) and&nbsp;<STRONG>The Faders</STRONG> (straight up rock 'n' roll not directed my way, if you know what I mean).</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Video Killed the Obscure Indie Rock Guy</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>In two weeks we're gonna try for my very first video.&nbsp;<STRONG> Cockeyed Ghost</STRONG> never got around to making one -- we were always too busy trying to scrape up enough money to tour.&nbsp; We're going to hold it in conjunction with the latest of the Reseda House Parties and it promises to be a chaotic and insane day.&nbsp; If you're interested in coming and being part of it, by all means, do.&nbsp; Part of the theme of the video is multiple couples making out, so bring a smoochee.&nbsp; The date is going to be Saturday, May 22.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>Bashing Maggi</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>I just discovered there's been a recent resurgence over at Maggi Cassell's&nbsp;guestbook -- I can't help but think my earlier Chaos Board post motivated the renewed activity -- and while some of the comments have been very snarky-funny some have also been pretty nasty, and mostly directed at her (although the dissection of my sex life continues unabated).&nbsp; </P>
<P>I feel a little bad about that, since my point in quoting the post was just as a jumping-off point to talk about how I feel about music in general, not to fulminate about the original comments.&nbsp; I sure didn't want to re-spark this old and unpleasant feud.&nbsp; The one upside is, as I said before, it's nice that people think the band is worth talking about, albeit in such a negative way.&nbsp; But I didn't like getting bashed back in '98, and even though Maggi&nbsp;did a lot of the bashing, it's not nice to see it come back at her either.&nbsp; I doubt she's going to gain anything positive or meaningful from it.</P>
<P>Anyway, at least Maggi's getting comments at her 7-year old website!&nbsp;&nbsp; In the week since the Chaos Board's been moved to Live Journal to allow for reader comments, there hasn't been much.&nbsp; I&nbsp;suppose when&nbsp;I write something interesting, the feedback will follow.</P>"

<P>Several hours later, into the wee hours of the night, I was bitterly regretting this decision as I was engaging in another round of vomiting that was so deep and convulsive it seemed to eminate from my groin.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Food poisoning as far as I can tell is just one of those things you deal with living in Southern California.&nbsp; Everyone I know has their particular horror story.&nbsp; Apparently my experience -- which involved me staying in bed for pretty much the entire following day, mostly asleep, although I semi-consciously took in an episode of the '50s Western parody TV show <EM>Maverick</EM> -- was on the mild side.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I won't be having squid anytime soon.&nbsp; On the upside, I lost several pounds and have cut out alcohol and coffee at least temporarily.&nbsp; Since I tend to abuse both, that's probably just as well.</P>
<P><FONT size=4>Alright I'll Do It --</FONT><FONT size=3><STRONG> </STRONG>At some point over the weekend I finally decided to accept responsibility for my music career -- such as it is -- again.&nbsp; With an album, DVD, tour and God knows what else to be arranged in the next five months, it was high time, but I'd been reluctant to assume the mantle of managing myself.&nbsp; I've just had it with the ""hey!&nbsp; Come see my band!"" part of doing business and I feel like I've gotten so caught up in it in the past that the whole process started to own me.</FONT></P>
<P>I think what switched me was an audio CD my keyboard player, John Perry, gave me of the last Adam Marsland's Chaos Band show.&nbsp; I thought it sounded fantastic, like a live record.&nbsp; The vocals in particular were first-rate all the way through (even mine -- and I often can't listen to my own singing...and I'm not alone in that regard!).&nbsp; In short, I found myself getting excited about it, and wanting to share what we're doing with other people.</P>
<P>So this week I picked out shows to go to all week to hang out, re-immerse myself in what's going on, and become a part of things again.&nbsp; Last night was a great opportunity -- I checked out the Stupor Stars (one of my favorite local bands, sadly it was their last show), Sugarplastic and the Shakes for the latter's record release party.&nbsp; As the evening grew on and friends introduced me to more friends, I started to get back into the rhythm again -- but not so far, I hope, as to be unctuous about it.&nbsp; After all, the bottom line is no one really cares that much!&nbsp; A music scene is, first and foremost, a social thing, and to the extent you go with that, it's really a wonderful experience.&nbsp; Get too caught up in the trappings and you're in trouble.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It's all basically a fun game.&nbsp; As long as I keep that in mind, I should be able to make some new friends and maybe share what I do with some people that wouldn't otherwise hear it.&nbsp; All good by me.</P>"

<H3>and Why I Close My Ears</H3>
<P>Last Saturday my friend Dar Senit invited me along to see ""Mayor of Sunset Strip,"" the recently-debuted documentary about legendary L.A. scenemaker/disc jockey/tastemaker Rodney Binghenheimer.</P>
<P>This film was a six-year labor of love for Dramarama bassist-turned-manager Chris Carter. Since Chris and I swim in the same circles, I'd been aware that this had been going on but despite having respect for Rodney (Cockeyed Ghost was one of zillions of bands Rodney was the first to play), I only had a passing interest in seeing the film. Although Rodney is a Zelig-like figure in the L.A. music scene, having been a pivotal figure in the careers of David Bowie, Coldplay, Dramarama, the Pistols and God knows how many others, I confess I chalked the whole thing up to music fetishism and I'm just not in that mindset right now (more on this below).</P>
<P>I couldn't have been further off the mark. Yes, MAYOR OF SUNSET STRIP is a musicologist's dream, with unique footage of (it seems) hundreds of music noteworthies, but it runs far deeper than that. In fact, MAYOR delivered more raw honesty on screen than any film I have seen in many a year. It was at times so upfront in its depiction of repressed emotional pain that it was difficult to watch. Over the course of two hours, you get to know not only Rodney -- a suburban, geeky fanboy whose influence was a major factor in the coalescing of what came to be known as ""alternative"" music but who was denied his props for, essentially, not being cool and cynical enough on a superficial level -- but other marginalized figures who exist in our daily lives but we find it easier to ignore, because they remind us of the deep, abiding loneliness that it's just to painful for most of us to acknowledge. MAYOR thrusts this in our face.</P>
<P>There are too many brilliant scenes in the film to enumerate, and I wouldn't want to ruin it for you by running them down, but the one that foisted my own prejudices back on me concerned someone that I've personally encountered several times and don't particularly like. At one point, this individual is forcibly diverted from his eternal fantasizing about a music career to a reluctant discussion of his childhood. The look of pain that crosses his face and his terse reaction tells us all we need to know about the circumstances that breed people like that and how the very things that make them laughable in the eyes of most of us are those things that they have to cling to to find meaning in a life that is much more difficult for them than we could possibly imagine. Or to quote the character in question, ""I didn't ask to have those people adopt me."" Jesus. Humanization, folks. I could use more of it. The world could use more of it.</P>
<P>If MAYOR OF SUNSET STRIP comes to you, you could take away something very deep from it should you go. It works as a musical travelogue, a commentary on the cost and true (ephemeral, even in the here and now) nature of celebrity, a primer on what music once was (and the soulless wasteland it has largely become owing to its commoditization), and above all, an unflinching look at something you don't want to look at: the personal, private day-to-day pain of your neighbor, your roommate, the personal in the next cubicle over, and the person you just passed on the street.</P>
<H3>Ears Wide Shut</H3>
<P>Watching MAYOR OF SUNSET STRIP brought another revelation out for me. Dar, an L.A. punk rock club girl from way back, had a look of rapture on her face as scenes of X, Bowie, and '70s glam and punk blared out from the cinema speakers. I marveled at her reaction...I love this music nearly as much as she does, and yet I felt curiously unmoved by it. Why? Had I become that jaded?</P>
<P>There's some truth to that, but it dawned on me that my feelings about music I'm passionate about has become rather like I would feel if I was desperately in love with somebody that had become distant, and I was afraid that I would never be able to be with them again. Those sounds fill me with joy but if I allow myself to be taken away by them, I'm afraid to come back to my senses in the here and now and find that energy strangely lacking in the world. It's not that there isn't great music that resonates with me being made in 2004. It's just that the focal points around which these forces gather to a large degree no longer exist. You can love the music still, but you can't live inside it anymore. There is no Rodney's English Disco, no Jack's Sugar Shack, for the most part no place for a subculture to gather the way that there was.</P>
<P>Later Dar and I hit Amoeba Music and I was somewhat heartened to see the folks that had gathered there...the post-stoners and Asian punk rock chicks rifling through imports of obscure punk bands. There are still enough folks in Hollywood to at least create that kind of atmosphere at one record store...but where would you find them in daily life? Mixed in with a thousand other people with whom they have nothing in common, tiny points of alienated light in an otherwise dark and conforming sky. Later we went to Aron's and it was nearly empty, with an air of pervasive gloom of an era gone by. Even in recreating that wonderful, creative, rich vibe that used to exist on L.A.'s streets, Amoeba had at the same time come close to putting one of the few remaining remnants of that era (Aron's) out of business.</P>
<P>And so it goes.</P>"

"event","<H2><B>I was onstage in Richmond, Virginia when everything flipped for me.</B></H2>
<P>I was three weeks into another endless solo tour, onstage in a restaurant/bar on a Wednesday night, playing for a table of ten loud, drunk, obnoxious people who exuded smug entitlement. They would shout out requests, which I would start to play, only to have them go back to talking over it before I'd finished playing the introduction.</P>
<H3>And it hit me...<B>I hated them.</B></H3>
<P>I knew exactly how I could have reached that table. After two years on the road playing every kind of gig, I knew what to say, what to play, how to get them singing and dancing. But I DIDN'T WANT TO. Why? Because they were stupid and to kiss their ass was to demean myself.</P>
<P>Boy, sounds arrogant, right? (In fact, I'm sure this post will come across as arrogant to some...why is honesty so often confused with arrogance? Just wondering) Well, of course it does, if your attitude is that an entertainer is at your beck and call and you have no responsibility to him/her. And actually, the fact is, you don't. If you go see a band, and they're not doing it for you, you have every right to walk out, to never see them again, yada yada yada yada. But what I hadn't realized for myself is that for years I had been putting myself in the position of playing for people that weren't going to get what I was doing, never would. And whose fault was that? Not theirs. Mine.</P>
<P>Although I came very close that night in Richmond to doing a Phil Everly -- smashing my guitar and driving back to L.A. -- I did continue the tour but with a much more pugnacious attitude, because I'd realized something fundamental about myself that I'm sure people had sensed for years. One of my prime motivations for being a musician had been to win love and approval. That in itself is not bad...every entertainer has this need or they wouldn't do it...but in my case, I wasn't trying to win love and approval from people who naturally responded to me. I was trying to win love and approval from EVERYBODY. And in this way lies disaster, both in life and in art.</P>
<H3>Over the years I've watched close friends blow right past me to fame and success.</H3>
<P>There was a time that made me jealous. But I've come to understand that there's a perfectly good reason that I never achieved that for myself and that I <B>probably never will</B>, and that <B>it's all OK</B>.</P>
<P>Y'see, people want from their art a reflection of themselves. They want to look up onstage and say, ""hey, I get that. It's cool to like that. That's me."" The more clearly focused and presented your package is, the more likely you are to find an audience that gets it.</P>
<P>Me, I find that kind of focus boring. Looking back at my own recorded history it's gone from punk rock, to indie pop, to alt-country, to whatever the fuck it is now. There is a common thread to it -- melody, complexity and honesty -- but even those are concepts difficult to get across in a nice, tight package. If I tried to do pare it down to one thing, I would eventually get bored with it. That's just the way I am.</P>
<P>And see, y'know, that's cool. The one thing I've always had going for me is there's no other Adam Marsland out there. I'm the only one that does what I do. It's the reason why, despite all my weird quirks, I have picked up a small following (and bless you if you're one of those folks). It's also the reason why over the years there are people that just <B>cannot fucking stand me. </B></P>
<P>Occasionally when I feel like I need a reality check I'll go over to Maggi Cassell's webpage and see who's posted in their Guestbook. Rob and Maggi aren't exactly my biggest fans, so people who have a similar feeling tend to vent there, although less in recent years because I haven't been out as much.</P>
<H3>Here was the latest posting:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>""Too bad Marsland and his stupid band are still around -- God, Adam is still as irritating as a bleeding facial mole, sending emails here, there and everywhere. He'd plug Michael Jackson's ass if he had an upcoming gig. Listen, I was there 'back in the day' in my own moderately successful Big Deal band, and Cockeyed Ghost were routinely dismissed as a below-average power-grunge band. Nothing more, nothing less. Now Adam is chasing mainstream audiences with his lame-o cuntry-n-western flavor-of-the-week bullshit. Too bad his ego got the better of his instincts -- he had potential, but has blown it all, utterly. Oh well, he can always temp.""</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Wow! Ouch, eh?</P>
<P>Now depending on how you feel about me, you're like ""right on!"" or ""what an asshole!"" or ""who cares?"" But see, it don't matter none either way. The person that wrote this (don't know who it is, don't care) was having a gut reaction to me. And if you're who they are, guess what, it's perfectly valid!</P>
<P>But if you're me, I don't have to care! You know why? Because I'm doing what I want for my own reasons, and if someone attributes motives to me that aren't there or just doesn't get me, that just means <I>they're not who I'm supposed to be playing for</I>. If you represent something that people like, that also means to a diferent set of people you represent something to hate. That's just the way it works. And if you annoy someone enough to bother to post on a webpage five years after the fact, it might be a sign you're doing something right. I didn't used to think so, but I do now.</P>
<H3>Do I suck?</H3>
<P><B>Well yeah</B>, to some people. Obviously not to others, or else I wouldn't still be playing after 10 years. The point is, if there's an audience out there to connect with and gets it, then it's valid. <B>That's all I need be concerned with.</B></P>
<P>But more than that -- and here is the thing this person and folks of their ilk never seem to get -- is that I've <I>always</I> done this because <I>I like it</I>. It's a big part of my life. It's all about ego to them (could it be because they gave up after they themselves didn't get stroked enough, so they can't understand why someone else would keep going?). It couldn't possibly be that this is what I like to do. If you like to shoot pool, or go bowling, or paint, fine! But people just assume that if you put yourself out there as a musician, that you're just doing it because you're on some self-deluding rockstar trip.</P>
<P>What's amusing (o.k., a little irritating) to me is I've put more time in playing grungy, shitty bars and knocking myself silly actually living the life than nearly anyone I know, whereas these clowns for the most part just sat on their asses awaiting glory and the kissing of ass. I've had my face thrust in my own irrelevance more times than I can count. And yet I'm the one who's somehow in denial. Heh.</P>
<P>But...but! There's always an element of truth in these things, and here it is. I HAVE been guilty of an outsized need for love, for approval, and I've been promiscuous in seeking it out (I don't mean sexually, although that's also somewhat true, frankly). And that's just wrong, it's not healthy, and it's not self-respecting. I believe some good people have sensed this and reacted against it. We're all tribal and while it's important to be open-minded to what others think, generally we should only be concerned with the respect of people that we ourselves respect.</P>
<H3>And I get it now.</H3>
<P>So I owe the audience in Richmond a debt of gratitude. I realized it's OK to feel that some people are idiots and you don't give a fuck what they think.</P>
<P>I'm going to call my solo CD YOU DON'T KNOW ME. It's a fair cop -- after all these years I'm fairly unkown and I've met very few people that truly understand what I'm really about. Is that their fault? No! Why the hell should they care? And why should I, when it comes down to it? <B>I'm not like most people. </B></P>
<P>I like my own music. I will always feel an obligation to try to get it out there and be heard, or else I feel like recording is just kissing my own ass. But even though I'll put in the effort I don't expect that masses of people are going to respond. When it comes right down to it, if no one likes it, that's fine. Don't care. The point is to get it out there and let people make their own decisions. Let's face it, yes, I caught some bad breaks over the years, but -- a lot of the reason I never got bigger than I did was that <B>not enough people felt strong enough about the music, or about me, to spread the word about it.</B> Doesn't mean it's bad music. Just means it didn't resonate with enough people. And that's fine.</P>
<P>Maybe some day I'll do something that a lot of people will dig, and more success will happen. If that day comes, fine, I'll go with it. But so much of that is about things that are beyond my control and to be frank, I'm not all that concerned either way.</P>
<H3>I play music because I like it.</H3>
<P>And that's all that I need to worry about.</P>"

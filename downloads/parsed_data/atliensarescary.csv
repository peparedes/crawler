"event","Damn i havent updated this thing in a while. This semester of school is almost over, but i got another 8 weeks of math. how fun. my moms moven up to jacksonville soon, and I got the option of either staying here at my dads, moven into a ghetto apartment in springs (i need a roomate though), going to community college in gainsville, or that ucf community college. I like the idea of gainsville, not only is the music scene pretty good, but theres a ton of drugs for me to abuse up there."

"event","Ive discovered that my old live journal (stonedmemorys) is still in existence, i dont really remember typing any of that stuff. Oh well. Its also been brought to my attention some one is ""lurking"" this thing, how cool is that. On another note i have determined I am the only white kid at BCC. Not that I have a problem with people of other races but I've lived in coral springs most of my life, and this multi-cultural thing is starting to fuck with my head. Since when am I the minority."

"event","So this weekend wasnt to bad. Friday I got to see american phyco for the first time which is an insane movie, what a crazy motherfucker. Saturday wasnt to bad either considering i got my projekt revolution ticket, and got to punch Eric in the face. I didnt punch him as hard as I wanted to but it was fun anyways. Well its 11 now which gives me exactly 11 hours till my homework is due tommorw, and considering sleep is going to take up much of that time, now would be a good time to do it."

"event","Ive been offerd extra credit points to complete a journal and turn it in at the end of the semester. Since im to lazy to actually write it out on paper ill give the infamous LJ a try. The only rule is I must write properly, other than that I can say whatever I want. Now if only my backround didnt look so shitty."

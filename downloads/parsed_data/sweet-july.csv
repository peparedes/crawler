"event","Hey everybody.  As the title suggests, I am indeed going insane.  I'm not one to normally get annoyed with my dad, but today he just really made me mad.  I don't care that he came home needing to use the computer while I was using it to work on my English paper.  He didn't take long checking whatever it is he had to check.  But he keeps nagging me about a class that I had to re-take.  Not like I don't get enough of that shit from my mom, and now I have to put up with my dad EVERY SINGLE fucking day.  I know he was only half-kidding, but I'm sick and tired of them bugging me EVERY DAY.  Every day my mom comes home it's, ""so how was your walk this morning?  Did you go to Curves? Did you work hard?""  And then my favorite, ""so what did you have for lunch today?  Did you have dinner?  What did you have?""  And then of course, by the end of the day, right before she goes to bed or I do, she'll either tap on my door, (which is beyond fucking annoying) or come downstairs and ask me about my classes.   ""How were your classes today?  Did you study hard today?  You know you need to pass that class.""  ARGHHH!!!!!  I just want to strangle her!  It's her pathetic attempt at still monitoring and controlling everything I do.  And then I'm only working weekends at Walmart.  I work fridays, saturdays, and sundays, and she thinks its took much.  and yet, she wants her money back so damn bad that I have to give her $200 for every check I bring home.  But if I'm only working two or three days a week I'll barely be bringing $200 home in my pocket.  She's so stupid!!!!!!!  And then she always says, ""well I don't mean to nag, I just worry.""  ---this is her explanation for asking about what I eat and whether or not I go on my mandatory walk in the morning.  how fucking insane is that?<br>
And just to make things worse, they went to Canada to watch my sister's track meet, and I couldn't go because I had to work.  and guess what?  she pulled the same shit she did at EMU.  She told my dad she was going to the bathroom and didn't come back for almost two hours. my dad had to send my sister into the women's bathroom just to see if she was in there, and of course she wasn't.  She was probably hiding somewhere crying her eyes out like a big baby because my sister didn't talk to her.  But does she ever think that she could..oh I don't know ......initiate the conversation herself?  No, of course not.  So when my parents left the track meet they went to this restaurant called the Pasta House.  and I guess my mom wanted to pretend that her stupid temper-tantrum never happened.  I'm so sick of her shit, and so is my dad.  I wish he would just divorce her lazy ass get it over with already.  Well, I've said my piece for now.

Peace out peeps!"

"event","Okay, so its been a long time since I've updated this thing.  I know.  I just wish it were March already.  That would mean that my mom would start traveling for work and my last semester at EMU will finally be over with.  Right now all I can think about is the dollar sign.  I have to save up all this money and pay back my parents for helping me with my last two semesters.  Fine whatever.  But I can't stand being here at home.  Why?  Because all my mom wants to do is talk.  Talk about work, and how much weight she wants to lose, and how much weight she wants me to lose.  I'm so over it.  Why can't she just shut up and leave me alone?  I've been sick for a week and everyday she comes home to say, ""oh you're sounding so much better.  Don't you feel better?""  Everyday she says I sound better.  I keep thinking- how the heck would you know that?  My cough still sounds bad, and my chest still hurts when I cough.  and she's making me go to bed too early- like at 10 because I'm sick.  she thinks it will help me to go to bed early and get more sleep.  only problem is, is that I toss and turn for three hours before I finally do fall asleep, so really, what is the point in going to bed early?  She makes no sense.  we were supoosed to go to my sister's track meet tomorrow at EMU but she's only gonna participate in one race, so they've basically decided we're not going, which, whatever floats their boat, but that means I'll be stuck in the house with them on a saturday with nothing to do.  Great.  the last thing my mom and I did to really ""bond"" was when we went into Jackson right before I got sick.  We had to do some shopping and then we went to see that movie ""Family Stone.""  It was a pretty good movie, really funny.  which reminds me, I finally rented Red Eye, and I loved it!  my friend Katarra said it wasn't that good, but I thought it was awesome!  It was so good in fact, that it has inspired me to write a new story, so I'm totally psyched.  Once I start working at Walmart I'll have money, which will be sooooooo nice.  I'll have gas money, and I'll have money to start paying off my parents, plus whatever is left is totally being saved up for Megan McCauley's debut cd.  I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to wait for her cd to come out.  seriously.  the suspense is killing me.  oh yeah a couple days ago I finally saw ""Ray"" on hbo.  man that was a good movie!  OMG!!!  more good news!!!!!  For weeks I was convinced that I couldn't watch Veronica Mars on TV here at home because channel five- one of the upn channels goes out after a certain hour and doesn't come back on until the next day.  well just this past wednesday I found out that channel 18 is also upn and it actually works!!!  YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!  I was so beyond psyched, because this past wednesday was a new episode!!!  OMG that episode was awesome!  I can't wait for the next new episode!!!!  :)  peace out peeps!"

"event","Hey everybody.  I made it out alive.  My wisdom teeth are gone.  They were surgically removed this past friday, and let me tell you, I was freaking out all the way up to my last few moments of consciousness.  I had a re-curring nightmare the night before, and that didn't help to settle my nerves.  Then my dad and I went to the doctor's office where the surgery was going to take place, and I was so antsy.  And the weird thing?  My wisdom teeth felt numb while I was waiting in the lobby.  Like they knew their time was up.  The nurse came three times to ask for other people, so I had to sit through that, and wonder when it would be my turn.  Then finally, at 20 after 3, the nurse came and asked for me to follow her to the back.  She took my blood pressure and pulse rate.  Then the doctor came in and asked me if I had any questions.

Of course I had a few, so he put my nerves at ease on my questions.  I remember telling him that my sister's lower lip took longer to ""un-numb.""  I'm not really sure how to explain that, except that her lip was still numb for the next three days and had no clue when she was bleeding or foaming from the mouth.  I remember the doctor putting the IV in or whatever that thing was....stuck it in my arm for blood or something, I'm still not sure.  And then the last thing he said to me before I woke up again was, ""Okay, your orders for the weekend are not to foam at the mouth.""  That got a lil chuckle out of me before I zonked out.

Then, seemingly five minutes later, I was awake.  The nurse was jumping around me like she was walking on glass, afraid that I'd fall over.  Then my dad came to the back and helped me to the truck.  We got the rest of my papers and a doctor's note for work.  Then I was in the truck with my gauze and medicine, thinking how lucky I got off.  I wasn't slurring or mumbling, and I could actually walk (somewhat) in a straight line!  My sister couldn't pull off any of that when her surgery was done.  Dad drove us home and we complained about my mom and what my dad's plans were once he could start getting the divorce going.  I'm guessing in about two years here, it's finally gonna happen, and I can't wait.  Sad but true.

Having my wisdom teeth surgically removed didn't get me out of going to church with my mom on saturday, but oh well.  I was walking fine, and the medicine was doings job.  I don't really remember which day it was, but I went with my parents out on the lake for a boat ride.  That was nice.  I finished a song and started working on a story that I hadn't worked on in awhile.  The water was really rocky though, cuz there were a bunch of people in their speedboats and what not, but it was fun.  Got another layer of sunburn on my arms for it, but oh well.  But ever since that boat ride, I swear it still feels like I'm trying to right myself.  Like I'm still in the boat and its pitching from side to side and I don't have anything to hold onto.  Maybe that's just the medicine.  Probably.

I was bleeding from the mouth a lot for the first day after the surgery, but after that it was okay.  A lot of pain, but no bleeding after that.  I went fishing with my dad on saturday and caught my first catfish.  that was one ugly S.O.B!!  Then we had a bonfire out by the lake later that night too.  That was nice.  my mom had to work on monday so dad and I had the day to ourselves. We went to my grandma hart's house for lunch.  I got to see my uncle mark and aunt ellen while I was there too, so it was fun.  I stayed later after everyone left.  My dad left with my uncle mark and I stayed behind to play cards with my grandma.

One cool thing that happened while I was at home, was that I think I found out what story I want to write for my fiction class this semester.  I had written one last year surrounding the drama with my mom and all that crap, and then I had an epiphany while I was at home.  I'm hoping it works out, but if not, oh well, at least I tried.  But I have an old paper I wrote about my dad from my freshman year at EMU, and I think I'm going to write a story about my dad.  It will include a bit about how he grew up, his glory days with the Mad Dogs (his band)...and then of course....the nightmare of being married to my mother.  I figure it will be written in the third POV, rather than first person, cuz that'd be kinda hard...getting in my dad's head.  anywho, I'm excited about it.

The medicine is still making me woozy, but I'm doing a lot better, which is nice.  I'm a little nervous about my classes tomorrow, but I'm still excited.  Thursday should be interesting.  I'll find out how much my art supplies are going to cost.  Hopefully not too much, and if I'm lucky....the professor will have everything in a kit at Art Attack.  That'd be nice.  I think that's all I have for now, so peace out peeps!"

"event","Hey everybody.  Lindsay-  I hope you read this soon.  I'm sorry about last night.  Apparently my MSN messenger isn't working anymore.  Every time I try to sign in it tells me that there's a new version of it, but that my computer is so old that I can't download it, so basically I'm screwed.  Do you have a yahoo messenger?  That would work, if you can't get on AIM.  I was so bummed when it wouldn't let me online, and it was getting late, so I ended up going to bed, cuz I had to be to work the next morning.  We'll have to get together soon.  Sometime after getting my wisdom teeth out.  Like when my mouth is done bleeding and I'm not doped on whatever pain medication they give me.  :)  I'll talk to ya soon!!!"

"event","The world isn't coming to an end, but the weekend before school starts I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled.  I'm not looking forward to that at all.  Hopefully I'll be all moved in before the freshman get there.  I'll be moving back to Wise Hall with my friend Lisa so I'm really excited about that.  But I'm still dreading the hurt, pain, and agony of getting my wisdom teeth out.  Hopefully I'll be okay enough afterward that I can just be driven back up to school or something.  There's just no way I want to be stuck at home.  That'd be even worse.  Speaking of which, I had the stupidest customer at walmart tonight.  I'm working at a 10 item or less lane (also the tobacco products line) and this family comes into my line, hands me a water bottle and I ring it up.  Then I see the wife pushing this cart down to me with it heaping full of stuff.  I was sooooooooooooo mad.  But oh well.  Life goes on.  And just to be completey random, ever since watching the movie Cellular, which I believe that everyone has to see, I've been trying to get my hands on every single Jason Statham movie I can.  I've been watching The Transporter and The Italian Job.  I stayed up last night watching The One.  It was pretty good.  Next up:  Snatch."

"event","Hello all.  Yesterday was my birthday, and yes, as the title suggests, I'm not sure that it was a particularly happy one.  My mom was on good behavior when I first came home on Friday, so I had high hopes for saturday.  Well, I woke up around nine in the morning, at the sight of my mother.  (Imagine my surprise, I'm 23 and she thinks she still has to get me up.)  Anywho, she wanted to go on a walk with me, and said that she had already gone on a walk by herself earlier in the morning, and that now she wanted to go on a walk with me.  Yay for me.  Yeah.  Right.  

So I get out of bed and get dressed.  And of course one of the first things we have to do is walk around the house so she can show me how her stupid flowers are growing and turning out.  Only the funny thing is, is that my dad takes care of all the gardening and landscaping, and yet the flowers are *her's*.  So as we're walking back up around the garage, we see my sister's car in the driveway.  She had to drive down from Detroit for my birthday, and she said she was coming home in the morning, and I was surprised that she was home so early.  My sister said hi to everyone and then left with my dad so they could run some errands, and then my mom and I took off on our walk that would give us ""bonding time.""  Whooptie-freaking-do.  Bonding time means having to listen to my mom telling me how to live my life, which is always fun.

The walk wasn't all that bad.  I just complained about my suitemate to keep my mom distracted so she wouldn't start nagging me too much.  Good thing too, cause it worked.  My family and I even made it through lunch, and my birthday presents without my mom ruining everything.  By the time we were playing Mexican Train though, my mom's patience had worn out.  My dad is new to the game, and we had only played it once before a few weeks ago, so he couldn't remember all the rules on how to play.  So every time he did something wrong, my mom would snap at him and start yelling.  It was really starting to irritate me so I tried in the best and polite way I knew how to tell her to stop yelling.  And she did.  For awhile.  When it was four in the afternoon she started freaking out because we had to go to church, so she quit when we were almost done to get ready.  So my dad, my sister, and I ended up quitting too.  Church dragged by, which sucked, because we went to St. Rita's.  I don't really like the church, but oh well.  Its the one church that's closest, since we moved to Cement City two years ago.

Anywho.  My mom seemed to be okay after church, although she was starting to nag a bit.  Good thing I wasn't staying home long after church.  We had dinner and then my sister and I got the hell out of dodge.

My sister had to hurry back to Detroit to smooth things over with her dumbass boyfriend, and I was off to Hudson to hook up with my friends Lindsay and Erin.  When I got to Erin's we decided to go to the movies, and we saw Fantastic Four, which, in my humble opinion, was a pretty darn good movie.  I can't wait till I get my next pay chekck.  Then I can go to Walmart and make the rest of my payment on the Fantastic Four soundtrack, which I put on layaway.  Yeah, I was quite broke at the time when I first put it on layaway.  Anywho, I can't wait to get it, cause the music is freaking awesome.  Next up, I have to get the Megan McCauley CD, because she is one girl who knows how to rock!  But back on track when I was in  Adrian.  That was good fun.  We went to a late showing, so by the time the movie was over it was nearly midnight.  And I still had to drive back to Ypsi.  I wasn't really worried about that part, I just had to find an open gas station.  So that's just what I did, got some extremely expensive gas and took Erin and Lindsay home.  Then it was back to Ypsi.  Got back around 2am and was all tucked in for the night.  I think I stayed up til 3:30, and then went to bed.  

So I guess I have to ask myself one question.  Was it really a happy birthday?  Yeah, I spose it was.  Despite my mom's weird behavior I guess it was a happy birthday.  Surprise, surprise.

P.S.  Linds-  about what happened before the movies: things will work themselves out.  and always remember, guys can be your best friend, but they can still be major tools. (ha- my 2nd usage of the word tool)  And let me know how things go in that department.  My offer still stands.

Peace out"

"event","Its nearly one in the morning, and of course I'm awake, and really bored.  My friend Lindsay kept telling me to get one of these, and now I finally have.  Only problem is, she hasn't updated her journal in awhile.  yeesh.  I'm soooo bored.  I've had food poisoning for the last two days, and I'm getting annoyed with my suitemate.  She's driving me nuts.  About an hour ago I was starting an email to send to a friend of mine, and half way through it I was jolted by a profound discovery that comes once in a great while.  Life can be pretty depressing.  And shouldn't there be someone to lean on?  Yeah, there should be.  And I look, and I claw at the air, I scream and no one is listening.  Good grief.  My birthday is just a few days away, and I should be reflecting on my life, setting new goals, and looking forward to spending time with my family.  But I'm not.  

My mom needs to be committed to an looney bin, and my poor dad is still putting up with her crap.  and I really really really really don't want to go home this weekend.  My sister is in Detroit having the time of her life, and we hardly ever talk anymore, which sucks, cuz I miss her a lot.  She's supposed to be coming home friday for my birthday.  Not that it matters.  She won't be home long, and then she'll be going back up to Detroit.  And I certainly won't be spending too much time at home.  No thank you.  I have nothing to look forward to when I go home.  

The last time I talked to my mom she said that the next time I came home I had to sit down with her and my dad to have a little ""chat.""  My foot.  This little chat will only further hurtle me down a never ending path of frustration when she tells me that I have to come home after graduating.  That I'll have to save up every penny that I make from Walmart, and that I can stay at home for a year, rent free, because she loves me.  That's the thing about my mom.  She likes to tell me how to live my life.  She's psychotic.  If she ever really knew how much she ruined my life, along with my dad's and my sister's, I don't know what she'd do.  Maybe she'd throw a party.  Maybe she would just fix herself another drink and say, ""Yep, all in a day's work.""  Or maybe she'd become even more depressed and come to terms with the fact that she's actually (*gasp*) not perfect.

I can already see it now.  I'll go home for my birthday.  I'll sit down for that chat, and world war three will break out.  My mom will yet again, ruin another family birthday...(she's been on a roll since last year).....and I'll either have the guts to tell her that I hate her and that I'm moving out, OR she'll try to kick me out.  Or maybe my dream will come true...and like my friend Katarra said, maybe my parents will tell me that they are getting a divorce.  That would make my day.  My mom could pack up all her crap and move in with her mom or get a place of her own.  Then my dad could live in the house until it sells.  Then I would never have to see her again.  Maybe.  Things change, life changes.  But I know one thing that won't.... my mom.  

I could keep going on and on about this, but its getting late, and I have to get up early for my campus job, and then I have to go to class, which I'm not looking forward to.  I had to get a doctor's note for missing class on Tuesday, which sucked, because he was giving a silk screen demonstration, and we were supposed to have our critique.  I have this fear, this dread in the bottom of my stomach, that if I get a B- in this class, that I won't be able to handle my graphic design class next semester.  Right now I'm taking Poster Design, and then next semester its Graphic Design 205 with the same professor.  I want all this stuff under my belt for experience, because I don't know if I'll end up doing something that I learned from my major or my minor.  Its all up in the air right now.  I'm cranky, confused, and irritated.

And I don't want to go home this weekend.  Home is not where the heart is.  That's where ""Mother Dearest"" dwells, the bane of my existence."

<P>we arrived around 2pm.&nbsp; hung out at the casinos for a little.&nbsp; ate dinner at a japanese restaurant which was very yummy.&nbsp; went out to rum jungle in mandalay bay.&nbsp; didnt pay for a single drink there... laura and i were dancing the entire time. the other girls, meanwhile, met a 42 yr old divorced guy who bought them a VIP table (and 2 bottles of liquor).&nbsp; apparently the guy liked me, and of course i had no clue...&nbsp; we met some cute fighter pilots from northcarolina.&nbsp; they are leaving for iraq in a few weeks.&nbsp; after rum jungle closed at 4am, the ""guy"" took us to this place called 40-deuce and got us another table and another bottle of liquor.&nbsp; we were hanging out, talking to fun people.&nbsp; we left there aorund 6 and got back to our hotel at 630.</P>
<P>saturday</P>
<P>got up around noon.&nbsp; went to breakfast/lunch.&nbsp; walked around our hotel for a little. took a nap until about 6.&nbsp; went to dinner at this place called the pink taco at hard rock.&nbsp; after that we went into this club called body english at the hard rock.&nbsp; it pretty much sucked.&nbsp; it was sooo dark you could see anything and you could barely walk anywhere.&nbsp; the music was really good though and dj scribbles was the dj.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; we (not me) called geoff (the guy from the night before) and found out that he was actually hanging out at hard rock (stalker?) and if we wanted to go somewhere else we could.&nbsp; so we decided to go back to rum jungle. he again got us a VIP table (plus 3 bottles).&nbsp; since it was lauras bachelorette night, we made her do all this shit.&nbsp; it was pretty funny.&nbsp; we met fat joes brother, he had some serious bling on.&nbsp; this really sketchy old dude wouldnt leave me alone and told me he knew me from a past life - and that i looked like an egyptian goddess??&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; WTF.&nbsp; got shitfaced cause we only had 2 hrs to finish all the liquor, we didnt finish but did a damn fine job, and actually took the bottles home with us.&nbsp; finally got back to our hotel around 6 and all the girls passed out except for me and laura.&nbsp; we sat out in the hallway waiting area (there were a bunch of couches and shit) and drank and smoked cigarettes.&nbsp; we met a guy who emerged from his room around 7am and he hung out with us for a long time.&nbsp; he was from california and kinda ghetto and i loved him!&nbsp; he called his brother up to come meet us so his brother finally got there around 9ish.&nbsp; we hung out/drank for a few more hours and then decided to go downstairs to the sportsbook so we could place our bets for the superbowl and watch the maryland game.&nbsp; at this point its 11am and laura and i hadnt slept yet.&nbsp; so we did the betting shit, found the maryland game on tv, drank 2 beers and then i was done and had to go to bed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>sunday</P>
<P>woke up around 3 for the superbowl (definitely only slept for 3 hrs).&nbsp; there was no way i could leave the hotel because i was still WASTED.&nbsp; the kids we had met the night (hours) before called and wanted to hang out.&nbsp; i told them they could come over and hang out with us but there was no way laura or i were leaving the general vicinity.&nbsp; they came over with beer.&nbsp; we kept drinking.&nbsp; not so sure of details from that day but i do remember the awful outfit mick jagger was wearing during halftime. and thats about all i remember....&nbsp; i didnt pass out that night until midnight but dont really have details on what happened from about 7 to midngiht.&nbsp; </P>
<P>monday</P>
<P>woke up around 6am couldnt fall back asleep.&nbsp; finally got up and packed my shit.&nbsp; we checked out around 10am and went hotel hopping.&nbsp; we went to MGM grand and saw the lions, went to the venecian and to paris. i slept the entire plane ride home.&nbsp; didnt get home until 2am.&nbsp; worked all day yesterday and had class till 830.&nbsp; ive been in a haze all day yesterday and much of today.</P>
<P><BR>god, long story.&nbsp; you guys need to check out the pictures though.&nbsp; they are awesome.</P>

"event","im much calmer now.  thank god.  the new manager started today and she took alot of the weight off of my shoulders.  i packed some shit for vegas tonight.  i didnt really try anything on and make ""outfits"" per se... i just grabbed a few pairs of pants and like 10 nice tops and put them in a suitcase.  i feel like i can pull off a going out ensemble with that shit.  apparently, i have to try and get people in to this one club we go to.  not sure why i have to do it, laura told me i had to dress slutty and try to talk my way in. uhh ok.. does laura not know me?  haha, i dont do slutty and i dont talk my way into places.  we'll see how that one goes.  


she wants to do 2 places a night.  one lounge-y type place and then a club.  god this is going to be outta control.  im bringing tequila.  hell yeah!  lots of pics will be taken.  im getting really excited.  hopefully tomorrow goes by fast."

saturday i went to this stupid operating room party with my mom for her work.  it was at ravens stadium, which was pretty cool, but the party SUCKED!  my mom got wasted and just kinda did her own thing.  i sat on my ass the entire time.  never again.

sunday went shopping and got some black pants and boots for my trip to vegas.  i feel so overwhelmed and almost on the verge of a panic attack because i have so much stuff to do this week... school starts tomorrow, i have all this work i have to finish by thursday- and i have to leave work by 4:15 on Tu/Th so i can make it to school on time.  its gonna kill me."

i guess it wouldnt bother me so much if i was going somewhere that i wanted to go, for an extended period of time.  i leave at 130 today and get back monday at 3.  i have to work through my long weekend off.  that really hits a nerve for me cause i know i wont have a chance to ""make up"" these days anytime soon. i guess i could use them for my vegas trip and not use vacation for the friday/monday i took off.  but i have soo much vacation its not even a big deal.  im thinking of taking off the week during my spring break from school just to relax and not do anything.  

i want to go to the beach soon too.  anybody wanna join??  maybe in 2 weeks?  or presidents weekend?  im sick of doing the same thing every weekend.

and now im just rambling.   well, off to atlanta i go.  im taking my laptop and hopefully they have wireless internet that isnt like $50 a night cause that shit would suck."

my eyes were burning so bad this morning.  the color of my eyes was like a yellowish/green (somewhat resembling a cat) and they were very bloodshot.  i guess thats what i get for staying out until 2am drinking.  fun times though.

sucks to blackout at 1am and the next thing you know you show up at some kids house at 4am, without your pants on, no keys, wallet, or phone.  hmmmm.

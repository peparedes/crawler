"event","I just got off the phone with my mom. She says all the neighbors have been so supportive.. bringing cards and flowers. They all knew her and they're all very kind. I told my mom that my friends have been wonderfully supportive as well.&nbsp;

I asked how Cash and Sawyer are doing, and Mom's voice sunk down to another level of sadness&nbsp;as she told me they're&nbsp;not doing well at all.. they've been all disoriented... they've been growling at each other, they don't know who the alpha-dog is anymore. (For those of u who don't know, we recently adopted Cash from the Brittany-Rescue program, and we're fostering Saywer, but we love him so we'll probably just keep him too). Maggie has just always been there.... they had respect for her, they never took her chair, they never bothered her.&nbsp;Cash would lick 1/2 the plate&nbsp;and move over to let her finish, just like a gentleman. But now..... now they just don't know what to do. They're wandering around her chair, looking up at it, sniffing around. It's like they're confused and don't know where thier sister is..... but on the other hand Mom thinks they know, and they're just sad.

When I heard that, a part me collapsed inside. I can handle my sadness, I can&nbsp;even sort of handle my family's sadness. But the dogs? No,&nbsp; that's&nbsp;something else altogether; that's a recipe for heart-break.&nbsp;

Mom told me more of when she&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;keep her from having another siezure.... when the lights were dim, when the house was quiet, when&nbsp;Cash and&nbsp;Sawyer were lying close, and when Mom was cradling our frail helpless Maggie in her lap. I can imagine it&nbsp;so clearly, I can see the tears in Mom's eyes as Maggie lay there staring up into them they whole time. Mom said it was like she was saying, ""OK Mom, I waited for you to come home, but now it's time for me to go......""

It's like&nbsp;my mom said, ""All you want to do is reach out and pet her soft little head...."" But we can't anymore. It's a crushing feeling, like dead-weight. My head is heavy, my eyes are blurry,&nbsp;it's dificult to will any muscles to move. Even my fingers feel especially heavy and stiff.. like it's so much&nbsp;extra work to even type this.&nbsp;I'll be ok, but right now I just need to grieve."

"event","She's gone.. our little Maggie is gone...&nbsp; our little Chrismas surprise... the sweetest smallest most loyal&nbsp;little&nbsp;puppydog&nbsp;you were ever going to meet. Pets came before her, pets came after her, but our little Maggie-pie was the heart of the family.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can close my eyes and see it right now as if it were yesterday.... Tanya was 3, so I must have been 6.... It was Christmas Eve....&nbsp;Gramma Jean's basement... family all around.. Santa came to visit that night and&nbsp;brought my sister and I a special little surpise.. a little Brittany Spaniel puppy! She was the cutest little thing, and never grew much bigger. She was defiinitley the runt of the litter.&nbsp;<br /><br />We named her <font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""6"">Maggie Noel Ferguson.</font><br /><br />Our little Maggie puppy had a special little bed with a little doggy blankie and a little tick-tock clock that was supposed to simulate the mother's heartbeat. Her bed was in the kitchen corner and she was such a cute and snuggly li'l thing! I remember standing in that same corner with Tanya teaching her how to count. I tought her to count to 10 and we were so pround of her!<br /><br />Maggie was an unusually empathetic dog. Whenever my sister and I would cry over anything, Maggie would be RIGHT THERE next to us howling her heart out.&nbsp;It's like she just <em>knew</em> it would bring us&nbsp;the comfort we needed.&nbsp;I remember one time I was crying after waking up from a bad dream. Then my Mommy appeared and after she had calmed me down, she told me that the reason she knew I needed her was because Maggie had been standing at the bottom of the stairs looking&nbsp;up and back at her over and over again. Just like Lassie. :-)<br /><br />I remember when Maggie was 3 years old and she still looked like a little puppy... no specifics other than the thought that she was a happy hyper little thing. From that year forward it didn't really matter how old she really was because she was always going to be&nbsp;a 3-year-old puppy in my eyes.&nbsp;<br /><br />So we moved to PA and the years kept rolling by, but there hasn't been ONE DAY in all her 15 years that our sugarmuffin hasn't pitter-patted all over the house at Mom's heels. Last year or the year before she could still run a mile with our Mom, but more recently she'd gotten cattoracts in&nbsp;her&nbsp;eyes, seemed to have extremely selective hearing, has been on arthritis medication, and stopped wanting to leave the yard. It's been sad, but she's still our little girl.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tonight I called Mom and her voice was raspy, as if she had been sleeping, but she hadn't been sleeping at all. She was crying and&nbsp;holding our preciouse babydog in her lap because Maggie had just had a siezure. Adrianna's darling Sheeba recently died after a siezure, so of course that was instantly on my mind. Mom said they called the vet who told them to dim the lights and keep it quiet. When I was on the phone Mom said Maggie was just lying there unresponsive, but she didn't seem to be in any pain. By the end of our conversation Mom said she was blinking and trying to get up. I was seriously debating going home, but I could hardly handle that image, let alone actually being&nbsp;there with my&nbsp;tear-filled&nbsp;mom and our Maggie lying there helpless. I don't think I would have known what do or or been able to keep it together. So Mom hung up with the promise of a phone call to let me know how she was in an hour or so.&nbsp;<br /><br />Peterson was here, then Amy and Marc, then Pat... there was a fire goin' outside.... I was drinking that wine cooler that was left over from when Adam bought them back in July.... when the phone rang. I had never heard Mom crying like this before, never in my life. I don't remember everything she said, but I'm sure you know the jist. I was like, ""NO!"" I tried to comfort her and find out what happened at the same time........ she told me that Maggie had another violent siezure and they raced her to the vet.... I don't remember if they got there before she died or not, but the vet was going to try to stop the siezure with a pill.... vikoden maybe.... but.... yeah.&nbsp;Aparently she had a tumor that ruptured. The vet said the only good thing about that was that it happened very quick.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mom was telling me how Cash had been sulking around and hanging his head all day long, even way before any of this happened..... and&nbsp;earlier Mom had been lifting weights in the basement when she heard Sawyer cry loud and sad so she came up to find him crying by Maggie. She didn't know why, and went back downstairs. But then he cried again and she raced back up to find him by her again, and I guess that's when she siezured. Mom said that both Cash and Sawyer were laying solemly by her and Maggie that whole time. They knew... <font size=""3"">dogs <em>always</em> know.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was fighting back tears while we were on the phone. Mom said she doesn't like the cremation idea, but we're not going to be in PA forever and she doesn't want to leave her behind. So cremation is what they're going to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />We hung up and I freaked, I freaked so bad... I was bawling so hard, I din't know what to do... I called Matt in here and he sat on the floor with me and cradled me while I cried.. I cried and cried some more and got a blue mascara stain on&nbsp;his white shirt. Then I went in the bathroom to blow my nose and fell on my knees with my head against the wall and bawled harder.&nbsp;After a few minutes I <em>was</em> able to pick myself back up, wipe my eyes, and return to my friends outside and Amy hugged me. I told her I was ok, I just needed to get it out.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;was thinking about how Amy said she threw herself on Tiff's grave, and how I have the same desperate urge&nbsp;with Maggie but I'll never be able to do that because she won't even have a grave. I feel like I'm being denied a grieving place, but I agree with Mom, I'd never want to leave&nbsp;our&nbsp;baby here&nbsp;when we all leave the state.&nbsp;I wish I could&nbsp;hug her and smother her with kisses again. She has......&nbsp;had.....&nbsp;this cute little tan spot on her head that has had more than a billion kisses planted there in her lifetime. Recently, almost every time&nbsp;I've hugged and kissed her goodbye while leaving home I had that little twinge in the back of my mind that it might be the last..... but it never really seems possible until you actually can't do that anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />So she's gone.. my baby's gone.. my lttle sweetiepie babydog is really gone.. it's so hard to believe... I love you darling... I love you so so so so much...&nbsp;oh&nbsp;honey&nbsp;baby,&nbsp;I miss you sweetie, you're my little angel, my little&nbsp;tiny little puppy angel.... you'll always have a special place in my heart, I'll see you in Heaven sweetie, <font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""6"">I'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER.</font> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","<p><strong><font size=""3"">SATURDAY:<br /></font></strong>My last blog was typed in MI the night I arrived, so we can skip it in this one. Oh yeah...&nbsp;I called Matt that night to say g'night and found out that he and Jasper missed me! &lt;3<br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">SUNDAY:</font></strong>&nbsp;<br /><u><em>WARMTH AND HEARTBREAK:</em></u><br />Up at 7:30, ate breakfast, visited, left Gma &amp; Gpa Mackety's house around 10:15 for church, and&nbsp;I was delighted to meet my baby 2nd cousin Mckenzie. Her mom sat next to me during the service and Mckenzie played with my bracelets the whole time.. what a sweetheart! I saw 3-year-old Michael too, but only for a few minutes until Stephanie took them home. After church, Mom and I&nbsp;followed Gma &amp; Gpa Pellegrom home. Ate potato pancakes (YUM!), chatted, discussed things, tried desperately to get my 3 cousins to come see me, but to no avail. I was heartbroken, but Gma &amp; Gpa said they don't even come see them. It's like they really don't give a damn about family, and that's really sad.&nbsp;:-(<br /><br /><u><em>TIME ALONE:<br /></em></u>Gma, Gpa, their foster daughter, and my mom went to church but I was pooped and decided to stay there to read. I got through 5 chapters on the pillar-porch, got bored, then found myself running up and down all 3 huge floors playin' with both pianos, and singing REALLY loud.&nbsp;Then I called Matt.&nbsp;<br /><br /><u><em>EXCERCISE:</em></u><br />They came home, we ate some more, talked some more, then Gma and I excercised to a dance excercise video thing and used like all the equipment and played ping-pong and air hockey on the top floor. Then Mom and Gpa came upstairs to join us, it was really tireing (Gramma is the energizer bunny!!!) but SUPER FUN!!! Around midnight or 1, everyone went to bed. ZZZzzzzZZZzzzzz<br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">MONDAY:</font></strong>&nbsp;<br /><u><em>THE FIRST GOODBYE:</em></u><br />woke up at 7:30, Gpa made us DELICIOUS blueberry pancakes, then Gma gave me discussed verses of the Bible about forgiveness b/c of what I'd discussed with her the night b4. Then we left by 11:30.<br /><br /><u><em>SAND BAR:</em></u><br />Arriving at Gma &amp; Gpa Mackety's again, Mom and I greeted Aunt Chandra and her daughters Kori and Terren and baby Jack. Alexa didn't come cuz she had to work. Losta rushin' around to get ready for our day on the water, then we drove to the boat launch where Gpa picked us all up with the pontoon. We cruised on over to the sand bar, which was covered in an inch - a foot of water, docked, and were joined shortly by Uncle Rick and gf Jay and her kids Jesse and Timmy.&nbsp;We spent about 5 hours just runnin around, swimmin, throwin' footballs and volleying a regular ball in circles and back and forth. There was a grill on the pontoon, so we had a cook-out, wich ROCKED!&nbsp;:-D<br /><br /><u><em>GRAVEL PITS:</em></u> <br />Later, we all cruised over to the gravel pits, which is like a beach but a lot of gravel on a hill and the water's super-deep. So the kids splashed around and the grown-ups put life jackets on like daipers and drank beer while floatin and chattin', while I was tredding water for like a 1/2 hour. It was funny cuz I was the only one out there doin' any work but I was just as relaxed as the rest of 'em!&nbsp;LOL!<br /><br /><u><em>SPEED BOATIN':</em></u><br />Uncle Rick was givin' rides on his boat.. he does this crazy shite where he goes like 40-60 mph and turns in circles and jumps his own huge-arse waves..... normally I think this is AMAZING, and I really have been waitin' THREE LONG YEARS just to ride in his speedboat again..... but this time I was scared shitless! Uncle Rick said I was so scared my sunburn vanished and my face turned white! I dunno... I guess since my accident I've been afraid of speed and corners... and it doesn't help that he wrecked his boat last year b/c of a random log in the water.... and also it seems that these days I care more about living that I used to. I felt terrible b/c even though Uncle Rick is crazily wild, he is THE best driver on the planet and I KNOW I was safe. And it really was fun... but that at the same time, I just.... felt terrified. It was rediculous.&nbsp;:-/<br /><br /><u><em>KATIE:</em></u><br />After about 8 hours of direct sun on the reflective water, my entire body burned to a crisp and still is as red as a lobster. My eyes were burned too and they kept watering really bad. I was having so much fun but in too much pain, so I was kind of glad to head back to the house. We ate, said bye to Aunt Chandra and kids, and then my cousin KATIE CAME OVER!!! That meant SO SO SO much to me, I love her and I missed her and she seemed to be the only cousin who gave a rat's butt about visiting me. She had worked a double shift, is 4 months pregnant, and had to go back at 6 a.m., but STILL came to see me. She's wonderful!&nbsp;:-D<br /><br /><u><em>BURNING SLEEP:</em></u><br />After she left, there was just more visiting 'till maybe midnight,&nbsp;then I tried to call Matt, but he was already asleep so I just left a message. I had spent most of the evening doctoring my scortched skin, but even that wouldn't have helped if Gramma dint have that anesthetic spray. I doused myself in that, which&nbsp;allowed me to sleep most of the&nbsp;night, aside from an awakening at 3 to spray more. I really should have taken it with me, but I'll be ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>TUESDAY:<br /></strong><em><u><font size=""2"">THE SECOND GOODBYE:</font></u></em><br /><font size=""2"">It was a quick morning..... up at 9:30, ate breakfast, called Matt, then went next door so Jay could help with my FAFSA application, but it didn't work b/c we needed mom's tax info anyway. Looked at pics that Jesse had taken of Uncle rick and his buddies flyin through the air on dirtbikes and 4-wheelin' through muddy hills and ditches. I would have liked Uncle Rick to take me 4-wheelin', but I have a feeling I would have been scared shitless at that as well. :-(&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, so then I walked back to Gma &amp; Gpa's house, packed all my crap, ate somethin', said our goodbyes to Uncle Rick and Jay and Jesse and Timmy, then left.&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><font size=""2""><em><u>THE THIRD GOODBYE:<br /></u></em>Grampa bought me and him starbucks coffee after drivin' 45 minutes and arriving back at the Grand Rapids airport. We chatted some more for about 20 minutes, then it was their turn to bid us fairwell. It's always sad, but we see those two the most out of all the relatives so it really seems like we could be just sayin', ""Love you, see ya later,"" which is actually an amazing thing, considering the distance. They ROCK.... my whole family ROCKS!&nbsp;&lt;3<br /></font><br /><u><em><strong>REFLECTING:</strong></em></u><br /><font size=""2"">WELL, we crammed like a weeks-worth of fun family time in just over 2 days... Mom made the observation that it really was ok b/c we got a day with each set of grandparents, but&nbsp;we didn't&nbsp;get to see Uncle Ron and Aunt Pat, which&nbsp;was kinda sad. BUT,&nbsp;at least Aunt Chandra came up to visit, which rocked b/c&nbsp;I hadn't seen her in... omigosh it must have been Christmas of...&nbsp;maybe 10 or 12 years ago. I don't even know. For Mom it's been longer than that. <br /><br />It literally tears me apart inside to live 12 hours away from my mom's side, and 20 hours away from my father's side. It's been like that pretty much forever, and I think it's just crap... complete and utter CRAP. But u&nbsp;know... I guess it just keeps me lookin' forward to the next family visit. Everyone always drops everything for us when we come and we get THE BEST treatment. Here's to lookin' on the bright side, eh?<br /></font></font><br /><br /></p>"

I eat like 2 or 3 times a day if I'm only awake 12 hours. But I'm still hungry. I'm hungry every 4 hours. It's crap..... complete crap. I know it's because I eat small stuff rather than actual meals, but it's still incredibly annoying to be hungry so often. I've been awake for about 12 hours now and I feel horrible......... my head is pounding, I feel like a complete loser, I'm friggin' starving.. but I absolutely positively CANNOT sleep on an empty stomach. I was laying there feeling icky and tired and like I wanna throw up,&nbsp;although&nbsp;pretty comfy in bed.......... the last thing I wanted to do was get up again....... but my stomach...... rumbling and hurting and sickening...... it's a horrible pain....... a seriously terribly horrible pain....... I had 3 choices: an orange, soup, or oatmeal. I'm no good at peeling oranges, and it probly wouldn't do much for hunger anyway. But I was trying to sleep before I got hungry again so I could save the oatmeal for when I got up and the soup for Matt the next time he was hungry. But no.. I can't sleep with my stomach in so much crappy stupid pain. So here I am, waiting for the oatmeal to cool down while I type.&nbsp;

And Emily, thank you again.... thank you so so soooo much!!! Ya know&nbsp;I never thought I'd say this in my lifetime... but... oatmeal&nbsp;is AMAZING.&nbsp;

We have.. ummmm.. probly by now $5 or so. you can buy a 10-pack of ramen with that..... and go to the dollar store to buy ritz crackers.... and I was hoping for a box of flavored oatmeal, but I guess that's out of reach&nbsp;until tuesday when Matt gets paid for that one day he worked last week.&nbsp; We both applied at Karns, and he's out right now with Yvonne job-hunting some more, so it's not like we're not trying. I'm just scared to apply anywhere that I don't know anybody or that I haven't worked at before. I don't know what my problem is, I've always been like this.&nbsp;

I'm like, scraping the side of the container and it tastes like&nbsp;romen and plastic. YUM"

I can't stand the concept of takin' ppl's money without the intention of hittin' them back.&nbsp;<br /><br />So here are my&nbsp;little semi-rules........ if you&nbsp;think it's unfair I'm sorry but that's just the way&nbsp;it is with me...........&nbsp;if you're a girl, I believe you need to be repayed even if you've only payed my way once.&nbsp;However, if you are of the male gender, you will more than likely pay for me 2 or&nbsp;3 times&nbsp;before I feel the need to return the favor. Unless of course, if you're broke too, in which case you probably wouldn't have offered to help me in the first place. Sooooo that takes care of that.&nbsp;<br /><br />ANYWAY, the point of this blogger is that I feel like&nbsp;crap for being all of your charity cases.&nbsp;I'm making a list to help me sort out who I need to hit back. I was going to try to remember everything they did AND what I owe them, but I think it will be impossible to&nbsp;remember EVERYTHING......&nbsp;you people are seriously super generous...... so yeah,&nbsp;I'm just&nbsp;makin' a list to get an idea of who and what to repay..........<br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">Eugene</font>:&nbsp;&nbsp;$30 <br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">Sue</font> and <font color=""#00ff00"">Ben</font>: dinner<br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">Jess</font> and <font color=""#00ff00"">Drenda</font>: dinner<br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">Adam</font>: alcohol at some of his parties... I'd owe his arse WAAAYYYYYY more than that, but he makes a crapload, soooo....<br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">Emily</font>: will be at all the parties :-) I'd hook her up with a bottle or 2 of her choice.. if I've got the money I don't care how many times!<br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">Marcus</font> and <font color=""#00ff00"">Bri</font>: alcohol and parties!

"event","I used to have baby dreams over and over and over.. but in all of them I kept forgetting that I was a mother, and when I remembered, I wouldn't remember where I left my baby and I asked Matt if he knew. But as soon as those thoughts came to me, they left just as quickly.&nbsp;

Gradually, I started remembering that I was a mom for longer periods of time.. but I still forgot.

In another dream, I was very pregnant and about to give birth to my baby. I went through the birth rather quickly, but with a lingering uneasy feeling. That's all I remember.

Then I had a breakthrough: I had a baby girl, and I was watching another girl that wasn't mine. However, I KNEW I would forget about them, so I made sure my mom was there too. Sure enough, I did forget about them, but when I remembered later I knew exactly where to find them; upstairs with Mom. She had them safely in their playpen, which I approached. However, I seemed to be more concerned with the one that wasn't mine.

This time when I went through the bloody, squishy birth, I was perfectly fine with it. Then&nbsp;my&nbsp;dream jumped to when it was all over and I was with my baby at an apartment that Matt and I shared. The love I had for my little boy was&nbsp;INDESCRIBABLE,&nbsp;but he didn't have a name yet. He wasn't quite a Riley... actually he seemed like a CJ. But I remember thinking, ""But what does 'C' stand for?"" Then it came to me.. Caleb. Caleb Jackson. CJ. PERFECT.&nbsp;I put him on the floor so I could run down to the lobby for a minute, but before I got 2 steps down the stairs I realized all the harm that could be done and rushed back through the door. I was overwhelmed with relief when he was safe and sound in my arms.&nbsp;

The setback dream: I was pregnant but something was horribly wrong.. the baby was creating a small but defined lump in my stomach. I was wondering around a hospital but nomatter where I went or how much I asked, NOBODY would help me! It was so entirely horrible, and I had a heartbreaking miscarraige.

In the dream after that, I was given a darker-skinned baby to foster straight from the hospital. But as I held him in my arms and stared down at the little darling, I knew he was mine because I loved him as I'd love my own. I had a hard time thinking of a name for him.. He wasn't a Riley, he wasn't a Caleb..&nbsp;I think I settled on something, but honestly I can't remember what it was now. All I remember is holding him in my arms in front of me and smiling down at this adorable child who I was destined to protect.

So last night I had another baby dream. I was babysitting this little bundle of smiles.. her name was Analicia. We were on an open&nbsp;moving train to a fun destination, and I made sure to keep this precious little angel in my arms at all times.&nbsp;The other moms were letting their toddlers run around freely and weren't always paying attention, which appalled me beyond belief. I even found myself reaching out to catch them when they stumbled. Meanwhile, I cradled Analicia perfectly with her head on my shoulder. When the train stopped, there was plenty of food available. I was pretty hungry so I started to hand her to my mom, but saw that she only had one hand. She probably could have handled it, but to be safe I decided to keep the baby until my mom was done eating. I GAVE UP FOOD FOR THIS CHILD. I loved her with all my heart.&nbsp;



And yet again, I'm watching the Discovery Health channel while tasting&nbsp;liquid salt as it runs down my cheek.&nbsp;So many concerns, so much to do before the time is right, but that does not stop this feeling. My thoughts are only for my yet-to-be-concieved child. I'm bursting with love and unbridled emotion, and it's SO hard to contain!"

"event","<p>After my blog about Mike in my xanga, Amy was wondering why some people know that they are going to die. I've read about stuff like that, so I tried to explain it to her, just to give her an idea of how it could be possible. I kinda want to record what I told her, so not only is it on her xanga page, it's going to be here too!<br /><br />Well, I read a book once that explained precognition in a theory. Every event that takes place causes a ripple in time, just as throwing a&nbsp;stone would cause a ripple in a lake. The bigger the stone, the bigger the ripple; the bigger the event, diddo. </p>
<p>The mind has the ability to ""remember"" events in time.. past AND future. However, we are raised to think that such things are rediculous. This is why children have more precognitive dreams than adults do..&nbsp;I bet you can think of at least 1 dream that you've had and that actually happened. That's because it caused a large enough ripple in time that it stuck in your brain.</p>
<p>Because our waking minds are taught to only remember the past, people normally only <em>dream</em> of things that will happen. That's because your subconcious hasn't been entirely tamed by society, and is able to replay the images freely. If you have that sort of dream, it's normally something that happens within the next few weeks, because it's harder to ""remember"" things that are further in the future. </p>
<p>But I think that something as earth-shattering as your own death is huge enough to cause a huge ripple, so somehow you will just know but you won't know why. As for why some people are more sensitive to this, I have no clue. I've only had 1 precognitive dream in my life, and that was when I was a kid. I'm the most out-of-tune person when it comes to weird stuff. I just see what most people see; nothing. </p>
<p>BUT there are other theories. </p>
<p>Like,&nbsp;someone I know would say that it's a form of prophesy. If God wants you to know your future, then you will know your future. This is a matter of being tought from childhood as well. Like for example,&nbsp;he&nbsp;was always told that the things he knew and saw were real. This is why his mind never blocked it out.. this is why he can see demons and spirits and this is why he is shown images of the future in his mind. But ME? I was always told that monsters aren't real, you can't see what's not there physically... basically, I wasn't raised Penticostle. SOOOOO I'm completely blind to everything paranormal. You're supposed to be able to open your ""Spirit eye"" and eventually see all of these things, but&nbsp;I've got a lot of spiritual growth to do&nbsp;before I can even come close. </p>
<p>So maybe Mike and Amy's best friend were more in tune with their spiritual side. Or maybe their deaths caused such a huge ripple of emotion&nbsp;that they felt it even before it happened. Or maybe it's a combo.. Those emotions and those huge ripples and&nbsp;the subconcious&nbsp;AND concious&nbsp;parts of thier minds which allowed them to process the info ALL happened because God designed&nbsp;things that way. In other words, God made science possible.</p>
<p>Only 1 problem with that statement: Mike wasn't Christian, he was Wiccan. This is why I prayed so much.&nbsp;His life was pretty much rock-bottom, but I'm hoping more than anything in the world that he is finally happy now. I don't care what religion he was or what religion he wasn't, I am down on my knees begging and pleading with God to keep him safe. He IS listening to me, but I don't know His answer. It makes me upset, but all I can do is keep the Faith. </p>

"event","<p>So there's this guy I used to hang out with over a year ago. I remember the first time I saw him.. it was 2 or 3 years ago after my friend and I were dancin' at Shimmer... we followed these guys back to the Frathouse for a little party. I had a blast with RoJohn, and barely noticed his friend.. but the next day I was introduced to this kid who I'd seen passed out in the chair the night before. He was always very nice and easy to get along with.&nbsp;<br /><br />We got to hangin' out more.. I think because he needed a ride somewhere and I had a car. I came to&nbsp;really adored this guy; he became my friend. I considered him a <em>very good</em> friend. At one point he told me that I was <em>his</em> only friend at the time, and I was the only one who was always there for him.&nbsp;I truly enjoyed spending as much time with him as possible.. I would stay with him for days at&nbsp;his apartment in Dillsburg before going home.&nbsp;For a few months&nbsp;back then, he was actually the only guy I felt comfortable being&nbsp;close to.. you see, he was always there for me&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />I drove him to wherever he needed to go, and he repayed me with gas money, although a lot of the time I only needed it to drive around with him. He told people that I was a reliable driver because I never got lost. :-) We'd drive around in circles at night all over the place.. back and forth from Harrisburg to Dillsburg. I remember pulling up to his parents' house early in the morning and&nbsp;parking across the street in the gravel parking lot&nbsp;many times. They treated me like part of the family and gave me a place to sleep whenever we were there. One day I actually gave them a KIRBY demo.. vacuumed and shampooed their living room.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've been to Pinchot Park with him. I've spent the night at his friend's boyfriend's mom's place at Lake Mead with him. I've followed him around for hours in Dillsburg during the farmers' market that one night. I've had many ""mind-altering"" nights with him and his friends, and have always felt completely comfortable doing so. I've taken 2 of my other friends to meet&nbsp;him at&nbsp;the trailor park where Brittney and Matt lived.&nbsp;I've brought him to my best friends house and introduced him to her and another friend, just before we all took him somewhere in Harrisburg.. the place with the fancy gate. We had a plast just drivin'.. Spending time with him was always an adventure, and I was always happy when we were just chillin'. One night we ended up back at his house with a whole crap-load of ""Kittens"" as he called it. He was never selfish.. always was a big share-er. :-) I asked him if we'd always be in contact, and he replied, ""Jodi, of course we will. I'll ALWAYS remember my friends."" He was telling the truth, and I truly believed him.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, that same night&nbsp;I&nbsp;can faintly recall&nbsp;something&nbsp;extraordinarily depressing that he was talking about.. it was more than that night.. it&nbsp;was&nbsp;something I'd heard from him before.&nbsp;He seemed to be conveying to me that he ""knew"" that something terrible was going to happen to him. It's becoming clearer now.. he told me that something was going to happen soon.. he said he was going to die. I understood that he was more enlightened on the subject than normal people would be, but it&nbsp;was&nbsp;such a horrible thought.. I told him that it couldn't be true.. and that he was making me sad. I remember almost crying when he said it. God, I wish more than anything I could remember his exact words!&nbsp;He tried to tell me not to be sad for him.. that&nbsp;he didn't want me or anyone to&nbsp;care so much..&nbsp;it would just be something that would happen, and I'd be ok. Of course I told him that I'd always care what happened to him, and nothing he&nbsp;could say&nbsp;would change that. God, I'm remembering exactly what I felt.. the same exact emotions I'm feeling right now... the same unrealisticness, the same unthinkable sadness. Whenever he said depressing things to me, I would listen.. I'd listen and silently pray for him. <br /><br />It had been many many months since I'd seen him after I quit the drug-scene. He showed up at burgerking with his boyfriend and another guy.. he said that they stopped by my house and my mom and sister told them to find me at work. It was soooo wonderful to see him again.. I was all smiles! We chatted for a few minutes and it was lovely. My regret of that day is that I didn't have the money to spare to put him up in a hotel. If only he had been alone, I would have asked him to stay with me and my boyfriend for the night. That would have been nice, but it wasn't possible. We said our quick goodbyes and he left. The rest of the night I was going on about how he used to be such a good friend and I hadn't seen him a such a long time, and how that made me super-happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />That was quite a few months before I quit BurgerKing.. so it must have been at least 5 or 6 months ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then tonight I decided to&nbsp;call Marcus, who called Jason and came over with his friend and got Matt and I. This girl and I started talkin'.. she said she lived in Dillburg. I told her that I used to hang out there like every night. She asked who I knew.. so I mentioned Mike. The next thing I heard would send me&nbsp;into&nbsp;a form of shock:<br /><br />He had been shot and killed.&nbsp;It was a few months ago, she said. I just kind of studderred.. I&nbsp;felt like there were tears tryin' to push out.. but&nbsp;I didn't let it happen. Not then. I just didn't know what to think. Or say. I told her she must have the wrong guy.&nbsp;Nothing bad would happen to him. She got all sad and serious.. she looked at me and told me she was sorry, but yes, it was Mike. I think I denied it a few more times.. I was just like, ""No.. there's no way..."" She told me to ask other people who knew him, but I don't talk to&nbsp;them anymore. I mean, I still keep updated as much as I can via myspace, but there's not much conversing. But I was still feeling disbelief. I said outloud, I just don't understand how this could be true, but I haven't heard until now. People type about everything on myspace, WHY NOT THIS!?!? <br /><br />I tried to block this info out for the night.. but I kept remembering things we'd done together and places we've went.. I remembered talking to him, I remember his facial expressions so incredibly vividly.. I randomly blurted out little stories through the night without any warning.. I'd be done talking by the time anybody had a clue what I was going on about.&nbsp;I found myself praying again.. like I did all those months ago.. but this time it was more intense. I was&nbsp;begging.. pleading&nbsp;for God to take care of&nbsp;Mike.. I don't have the slightest clue where he is now, but I just&nbsp;had to pray.. I had an urge to kneel down and burst into tears.. but it just wouldn't have been appropriate. So yeah.. we went on visiting 'till early morning, then Marcus drove Matt and I home...<br /><br />Matt fell asleep within a 1/2 hour.. but I just layed there thinking. I tried to stop, but then the tears.. just like right now.. I still don't know what to think.. people have died before, and I'd always thought it was a sad thing.. but NEVER anyone I was FRIENDS with! This is why it must not be true. This girl didn't seem entirely sure about herself AT FIRST, but then she was. So I was thinking there's that hope. But I'm still.. I.. I just.. ugh. I don't even know. I just&nbsp;need to pray&nbsp;more... I have to pray hard... I just can't even think of the words to say.. it's just intense emotion... I can't even portray any of this correctly by typing. I just had to try. Matt knew I was upset and squeezed my hand in way that silently said, ""I'm here for you."" But I couldn't lay in bed dwelling anymore. I had to come out here and type. I messaged Kaylie b/c she was one I was told to ask.. I hope she gets back to me soon. I told Tabitha b/c she was the first person I've talked to so far who knew him. I just don't even know what to tell her.. I don't know what to tell myself. I just don't know.&nbsp;<br /><br />My eyes hurt now, and I think this is all I can say now. If somebody reads this, and you know it's true.. or if you know it's not true.. please, PLEASE let me know! How can this girl be right? How could she be wrong? Both statements seem rediculous.. I can't even see the screen clearly.. I feel so.. not even here right now... </p>"

"event","WELL it finally happened. My phone is gone. Well, at least my connection.&nbsp;<br /><br />No more calling Long distance for the same price as local<br />No more random calls from ppl I haven't heard from in a while<br />No more wake-up calls from ppl who don't know I'm still asleep<br />No more 24/7 availability<br />No more texting friends<br />No more texts from friends<br />No more Myspace-update texts<br />No more weekly texts from the 4400 characters&nbsp;(new show on USA)<br />~~~~ (that was my favorite new exciting feature in my life, and now it's GONE!!!)<br /><br />As you can tell, I'm devastated. I should have called Gramma M.&nbsp;on her b-day last night, I had plans to call my Gramma Jean&nbsp;'cuz she's been in a few of my dreams lately, and&nbsp;I wanted to call Aunt LeaAnn to see how the much-awaited pregnancy was going. I miss all of them (AND everyone else) so so much and I really did wanna talk to them, even though I'm fed up with&nbsp;the long-distance life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Matt and I went to my sister's work this morning, filled out the aplications, had the little phone donation audition, &amp; got a break either 'cuz the girl knew how tired we were or b/c Tanya is my sister. Either way, we're goin' in for the training classes starting on the 25th. SOOOOOOO hopefully that will work out b/c $30 an hour between the 2 of us and a minimum of 25 hours each per week is pretty decent livin'! And don't forget the best part.. it's only a minute away! MAJOR gas savor!!!<br /><br />I've been so fed up with my sleep schedule, I hate it, I hate it I hate it <font size=""3"">I HATE IT!!!</font> I've already explained everything to everyone it seems, but let me just talk about what my body is doing with me. I'm kinda sluggish throughout the day, and I&nbsp;get practically immoble after 7 hours of being awake. However, my brain keeps bouncing around all over the place until I've been awake for around 13 or 16 hours.&nbsp; So, when I finally do get to sleep, I NEVER WANNA WAKE UP. So it'll be anywhere from 9-13 hours of sleepytime. Any less, and I feel like you would if you only had 2 or 3 hours. It's <font size=""5"">COMPLETE CRAP. </font><font size=""2"">BUT... the cool thing is that my doctor's appointment is TOMORROW!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!! It's been a long-time commin' and it's finally here!!!<br /></font><br />But anyway, If you want to get ahold of me, Matt has a line in the basement. I'm not gonna post the number, but if you want it I'll gladly send it to you in a private message. Aight, I guess that's all fer now, L8TR!<br /><br /><br />"

Like if I'm angry I'm <font size=""3"">INFURIATED</font>, or if I'm sad I'm <font size=""3"">SUPER-DEPRESSED</font>, or if I'm upset I'm <font size=""3"">DISTRAUGHT</font>, if I'm happy, I'm <font size=""3"">EXTATIC</font>, and&nbsp;if&nbsp;I think Matt's cute for some reason&nbsp;I wanna <font size=""3"">SQEEZE HIS FACE</font>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then earlier this week and still now&nbsp;I've been wanting to <font size=""3"">BITE</font> things really hard, like all the way through the skin,&nbsp;and <font size=""3"">SQUISH</font> things to death.. like Jasper and Matt.. they're just so darned <font size=""3"">ADORABLE</font> and I love them SOOOO MUCH that I just wanna <font size=""3"">SQUEEL</font> and <font size=""3"">SQUEEZE</font> 'em till they can't breath! <strong>I don't actually do this of course..</strong> I want to.. but I don't wanna HURT them, so I use restraint. My jaw has been <font size=""3"">CLENCHING </font>sooo much lately, it's like my teeth are always tapping together and the joint part of my jaw is soooo stiff.. you know.. <em>clenchy</em>. Which is why I want to bite things, and why I find myself sucking on my toung. <font size=""5"">It's soooo weird!!!</font> Also when I was upset about something the other night, I was actually <font size=""3"">PSYCHOTICALLY FREAKING OUT</font> and I had this urge to <font size=""3"">HIT</font> things and <font size=""3"">SPAZZ <font size=""2"">on</font> </font>the person who provoked this <font size=""3"">ANGUISH</font>.. so I did.. like I didn't even think, I was just <font size=""3"">SCREAMING</font> and <font size=""3"">CONVULSING</font> and <font size=""3"">GRABBING</font> and <font size=""3"">SHAKING</font>. It's like all common sense was completely impared. <font size=""4"">I know that's not normal, but niether are <em>ANY</em> of these urges!!!<br /></font><br />But this morning.. it's like.. WOW.. I haven't felt this in like over a year... the last time I felt this.. was.. just as the <font size=""3"">""roll""</font> kicked in.. the early beginnings of it.. when you start to feel it commin'.. when yer pupils start dialating.. and your jaw starts clenching.. just a little..&nbsp;I was sittin at the computer feeling my jaw clench, so I was massaging just under my ears.. and that's when I felt it. It's like I'm <font size=""3"">light-headed</font>, and <font size=""3"">happy</font>, and I want to <font size=""3"">smile</font> for no particular reason, and was petting Jasper 'cuz he was on my lap.. he was <em><font size=""2"">sooo soft</font></em>, and I just felt like I <font size=""3"">LOVE </font>him <em>SOOOO MUCH</em>.. I kissed his face and hugged him.. then I went to lay down.. and started praying...&nbsp;<br /><br />I thanked God for everyone.. for the forgiveness He's recently shown me through Jess... I thanked Him for her, and for Drenda.. and then for Matt,&nbsp;and for Emily and Matt (P) and Adam.. I wanted to say Brian, but I'm not sure what good he has done.. so I thought for a second.. but then I thought someday he might contribute some good to the world, so I thought <em>what the heck,</em> and thanked God for Brian too.. and for Adrianna, and for Melody... it was basically just everyone I've recently talked to who popped into my mind. I thanked Him for answering my prayers about me and Matt.. I thanked Him for ""fixing"" us, and for how wonderful Matt is.<br /><br />I kept thinking of Matt and how much <font size=""5""><em>I love him</em></font>.. I was wishing he was next to me so I could feel his comforting warmth.. and&nbsp;hear him breath... so that's when I got up and walked out to the couch. I kneeled down next to him and saw him and Jasper sleeping there so <font size=""3"">peacefully..</font> Matt's face is so <font size=""3"">sweet</font> while he sleeps.. I felt my eyes <font size=""3"">welling up with emotion</font> as I smiled at him and felt more of that old but delightfully familiar feeling of&nbsp;<em><font size=""4"">ecstacy</font></em>. It seems like such a <em>chemical</em> feeling, and I don't know what triggered it, but I really wanted to type it out and see what you guys think. So if you sat here and read all this.. and you're thinking something, please let me know! I'd appreciate it very much. :-)<br /><br />&lt;3<br />Jodi :-)<br /><br />P.S. I'm still feeling very floaty and VERY NIIIIICE... lol! =D<br /><br />"

"event","<p>ok so last night my stomach kept gugling and feeling empty even though i ate and it hurt so bad and i was staring in the&nbsp;mirror&nbsp;at all my stomach rolls and the stretch marks that keep getting bigger nomatter how much cocoa butter creme i use and all that flab at the base of my neck and under my chin&nbsp;and&nbsp;<font size=""3"">freaking out</font> wondering why i was so chunky but still so hungry and why my metabolism is so dumb b/c when i wake up i'm really hungry but it takes practically nothing to calm the pain but then at night i get <font size=""3"">UBER</font> <font size=""3"">hungry</font> and nothing i eat is enough. </p>
<p>there was thing thing on discovery health and this guy's leg was like 150 lbs or something and it was because of a blockage in the leg-draining system so the whole body drainage system shut down and the cure was compression and leg and neck massages b/c the central cleanage/drainage system is in the neck. Well the thyroid is in the neck and my foot has been pretty danged FAT ever since i twisted it in 11th grade and they did x-rays and MRI's and they told me<em><font size=""3""> NOTHING IS WRONG</font></em> but that was a load of <font size=""3""><strong>BULLSHIT</strong></font> b/c it's not retaining water for no stinkin reason! So recently i found out it's cuz of that dumb stupid thyroid crap and i just want it fixed cuz it's not even just my foot, it's my ankle and leg too, it's bigger than the left, i wanna stop it, <font size=""3"">I DON'T WANNA LOSE MY LEG!<br /></font><br />i just wanna&nbsp;be fixed i don't&nbsp;wanna be in this sitch anymore i don't wanna be hungry all the time,&nbsp;i don't&nbsp;wanna sleep 9 - 15 hours every night, i don't wanna wake up after 9&nbsp;or 15 hours and feel like it was only 2 hours, i don't wanna&nbsp;&nbsp;be kept awake b/c my head is spinning with stuff that keeps my awake, i don't want my head to be cluttered,&nbsp;i don't wanna be tired all the time, i don't wanna feel exhausted after being awake for 7 hours, i don't wanna feel dizzy after being awake for 8 hours, i don't wannna be overwhelmed anymore, i don't wanna be spastic, i don't wanna be angry, i don't wanna be sad, i don't wanna be confused, i don't want my fact puffy anymore, i don't want fluid in my feet, and&nbsp;<font size=""3""><strong>I DON'T WANNA BE</strong> </font><font size=""5""><strong>FAT!!!</strong></font>&nbsp;<br /><br />so anyway,&nbsp;i ate a hotdog to try to stop the gurgley pain but that didn't work and it gave me indigestion and it hurt sooo bad but not as bad as when it moved down and i was like in tears cuz it hurt so bad and i was so freaked out cuz i kept thinking about that scene in The Devil's Advocate where that lady was bleeding and the baby was holding her uterus and laughing and OMG that's the most horrible thought EVER! And then i was in and out of the bathroom like every 10 minutes from like 4 - 6:30 and i thought i was dying but&nbsp;Matt said it's b/c all&nbsp;we've been eating is little tiny stuff for the past few days so when my friend Eugene was kind enough to take me out to Quiznos for a sub and salad my digestive system&nbsp;didn't know how to handle <font size=""4"">REAL&nbsp;FOOD</font>. Now I think that's kinda sad.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I <em><font size=""3"">FINALLY</font></em> got to sleep around 7 a.m., only to wake up a few&nbsp;hours later to that damned alarm, it was so loud and&nbsp;Matt wasn't budging so i'm i struggling to get up and i'm listing to the cat&nbsp;yell at me cuz he's hungry&nbsp;but it's not like&nbsp;he has any food so i can't feed&nbsp;him and i stumble across this dirty carpet&nbsp;and poke around the clock for the <font size=""3"">SHUT UP</font> button,&nbsp;smack it with my pointer-finger, and stumble back into bed only to be woken up with that <strong>loud</strong>&nbsp;<font size=""3""><strong>loud</strong></font> <font size=""4""><strong>LOUD</strong></font> phone ring and answering machine <font size=""3"">TWICE</font>&nbsp;and&nbsp;at the sound of Tabitha's voice, Matt suddenly <font size=""3"">HOPS</font>&nbsp;right outa bed for some odd reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So he kisses me and leaves me there to TRY to fall asleep again, but all I can do is sit there and wonder<font size=""4""> WHY THE HECK DID HE JUST LEAVE ME?&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;and then all i could do was keep playing all that stuff i just wrote up there ^ back in my head over and over and over and over and over until i finally got up to write it down. Or type it. Whatever. Oh yeah and i had to find out when exactly he planned this little outing b/c it sure as heck didn't seem spontanious by the sound of it, so i checked yahoo messenger and sure enough, they were sitting at their computers planning to to get together this morning while i was somewhere around here crying. Now I love Matt extraordinarily much and he has&nbsp;a right&nbsp;to leave me alone in bed to go see his friend without telling me, but for some stupid reason that thought just makes me wanna cry again.<br /><br /></p>"

<p>My right eyelid is twitching pretty rapidly.. my gramma P. said that it was from a lack of calcium when the same thing happened to her. And whatdoyaknow, We're outa milk, cheese, and yogurt.. and I've been cravin' cheese like mad. Did you know that our cheese disappeared? I only had a few slices.. Matt swears up and down he did NOT finish it, and he put it back in the fridge. SO WHERE DID IT GO????</p>
<p>I'm still hungry. This is what we have: 2 pudding packs. Stale cherios. Saltine crackers. Starcrunch snacks. </p>
<p>I had pudding and a starcrunch around midnight... so.. saltines. Wow I have a headache. </p>

I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm cranky, and I can't be happy about my boyfriend having to&nbsp;run all over the globe when he's about to fall over. He could have hallucinated and swerved off the road.. something&nbsp;could have ran in front of&nbsp;the&nbsp;car..&nbsp;he could have hit something.. just.. just.. so many things could happen on a windy narrow country road in the dark... so many horrible dangerous things.. I worry every day when he does it, but when he's falling asleep?&nbsp;And being told things.. things that I don't agree with, things that I PERSONALLY know are not true, or are true, just something that I don't agree with and is it really that hard to just accept&nbsp;what&nbsp;I'm saying? I don't wanna feel wrong anymore, I don't wanna feel like everything I do or say is wrong. I don't wanna explain myself anymore, I just don't want to be angry anymore.&nbsp; 

I can't wait 'till I get my light-hearted mood back. Anything goes.. is there something wrong? OH I didn't notice 'cuz everything's coooool. Just chillin' like a villan! HARHAR! Problems? WHAT problems??? No problems here! I'm happy slappy and gay. Yay! If you're not happy it's ok cuz i'll tip-toe around you and make sure I help you in any way I can. And I'll be happy doing it because that's who I am.. I care about people, and I love to help. I want to help everyone, and if you're not happy, I'M not happy, because I'm an empath and I can feel what you're feeling and I can understand why you're angry or sad and I don't get angry about it because I'm a calm happy&nbsp;soothing person. I'll take care of you and do anything for you because that's what friends do, no questions asked. I know you'd do the same for me. And if you wouldn't, that's ok because maybe you just need a friend to show you that everything doesn't suck. Because it IS ok! I'm happy, I have energy, I want to go for a walk and I want to go to work and make money to feed us and assist us in doing fun things! We'll be able to spend, but not too much because I'm saving it for my not-yet-concieved baby. I just want the best for him/her, and I'll endure any kind of annoyances with a smile.... a REAL smile.. because my baby is more important to me than any kind of annoyances I have to deal with in the present. I love this child, and I love Matt, and I love my friends and I love my family and I love my boyfriend's family nomatter what they did in the past because God loves EVERYONE and Jesus has allowed me to love everyone as He loves everyone. I'm nice like He is, I'm kind like He is, I care like He does, I don't get angry because He doesn't,&nbsp;I'm gentle like He is, and I love like He does; completely unconditional. Because you know.... I'm just a very happy person!&nbsp;

STAY TUNED for the personality switch of a lifetime. Normality.. COMING SOON to a Jodi near YOU!!!"

"event","I've been trying to re-train my brain to type grammatically correct and stuff because I REALLY want to go back to school!!! I think I've been doing a decent job of that, but just for tonight, I think I'll drop it.&nbsp;

It's 4:15 and I should be asleep. Matt is. Oh yeah, and Jasper just puked 3 times in the last 15 minutes. ope, nevermind, 4. are we gonna make it 5? waiting... waiting... ok maybe he's done. OMG i'm so grossed out right now.&nbsp;I mean it's gross to begin with, but when i hear him and i glance over out of sheer impulse he just looks so helpless and convulsing.. and then i think about how that feels, like the morning after vodka and pure sugar. EEAAEAEAEAKKKKKH!!!!

I'm feeling very overwhelmed again. This is not an angry week.. it's just a cluttered week. like head-clutter, I guess. I don't know what to say about it.. I mean stuff will just freak me out, like stuff I don't know how to deal with, and i'll feel like, a&nbsp;silent freaked-out feeling,&nbsp;and then i'll just kinda shut down, and Matt won't understand at first and I'm soooo sick of saying the same damned thing over and over and over and OVER... So I just kinda sit there and not know what to say or how to react or what to do or what to explain. I feel like such a moron but I really don't wanna sit here and try to put the jumbleness into words, it's just so... um.. hmm. well it's something I don't know how to do. Well, unless I just tell him, ""I can't find the words, because, you know.. that thing.. that thing that's been happening to my head lately.. I said it yesterday.. and the day before... sort of.. or something."" And then I just hope he gets it. But I don't know how anybody could, not even the ever-so talented center of my affection.&nbsp;

I had some good days.. I even had a good week.. it was when I was reunited with Melody. Matt noticed too.. I'd been draggin' butt and then Mom called me to tell me that Melody was at Jubilee Day and then we met up and I'd been SUPER HAPPY ever since! I mean that WHOLE WEEK! I was all too happy to help her with whatever she needed help with, and I actually had energy, I wanted to excercise, I wanted to run up and down steps and I wanted to go kayaking and take walks and stuff.. My muscles DID NOT ACHE!!!!! It was SOOOOO AMAZING!!!!&nbsp;I even found the strengh and calmness to QUIT SMOKING!!!!!!!!!

And then she left. less than a week later, i started not waking up again. i started not sleeping agian. i started getting angry again, and feeling overwhelmed and then when i tried to use that stair-stepper she got me, my knees ached soooo much worse and my muscles generally didn't want to exsert their muscle-strengh. It's like all that endurence and energy I was blessed with the week before just VANISHED.

&nbsp;I was discussing it with Matt, and I was telling him that I'm soooo glad that God allowed the week before Melody left to be a ""good week"". but then i was thinking that maybe it was a ""good week"" b/c seeing my long-lost friend made me really happy, and the genuine happiness made the tiredness and the achyness and the spazziness go away. so then it would be a scientific thing. but then Matt said EXACTLY what was running through my mind, ""Who's to say that it wasn't God's plan for you to be happy and having a good week when you saw your friend?"" And I'm just like ""YEAH.. cuz it's an act of God that can also be explained by science, and it's that how the world works?"" He agreed.&nbsp;

Other happy things that ease psychoticness:&nbsp;

Kayaking with Adam was purely lovely, and I wanna do it again soooo bad. I hope next time it'll be with my lover. &lt;3

Gettin drunkalunka with Emily and Emily and Peterson at Emily's house.. LOL.. Dancin' to Tori Amos in the middle of the room.. lotsa smileyness!

Partying with Adam and Emily and Emily and Peterson... that was like the most fun night EVER and we have a zillion pics to proove it!!!

Goin' to the music fest with Sue and Ben.. they were kind enough to swoop me up and take me to a far-away land with music and groovin and outdoors and then after dark they bought pitchers so I got loosened up to finally go and dance in the crowd with the live band at Tom Sawyers.. it was AMAZINGLY FUN... I didn't want to stop!!! Then Dukes.. another pitcher &amp; a BEAUTIFUL deck on the water.. OMG it was sooo lovely.. then.. oh THEN! They were tripple-quadrupley kind, picking up Matt and taking us to the diner. I just can't thank them enough.. I hope that I can return the favor somethime REALLY SOON!!!!

A walk to the park and to 7-11 and back with Joe &amp; chattin was really nice

Bein' surprised by my sister and her boyfriend coming early to take us to the music fest today

Even though I dragged Matt ALLLL around the Beach Boys thing, and we were all hot and sweaty, I had a fabulous time just cruzin' up &amp; down front street with the man of my dreams.. then finally meeting up with Joe &amp; Tasha &amp; George on the bridge for the Works.. They were quite magnificent as well!&nbsp;

speaking of ""magnificent""... that reminds me of when Matt &amp; I were sitting outside of 7-11over 9 months ago... I don't remember why, but he looked to the side and up at me through his samson-like hair and deep, calming, gentle eyes, reached up to push a lock of hair away from my face with the gentlest touch I've ever felt, and told me, ""You.. are magnificent."" I knew he meant it with all the love and kindness in his heart and soul...&nbsp;I melted.. I just melted.&nbsp;

I LOVE YOU, MATTHEW!!! &lt;333"

"event","My Daddy runs the HUGE grocery store in a big enchanting castle. The road leading to it and the land around it is sooo beautiful. The spacious courtyard is all fenced&nbsp; off and it gets darker and scarier as you look further into it, but I don't pay much attention to it. The castle has many traditional&nbsp;pointed sections on top, and the color is a deep majestic grayish-purple.&nbsp; The grocery store is brilliantly lit to show off the shine, spaciousness, and perfect organization&nbsp;in all it's glory. As an energetic little&nbsp;girl, I am free to run rampid in circles or from section to section as I please. I don't have a care in the world because <font color=""#ff99cc"">MY DADDY</font> owns this place, and <font color=""#ff99cc"">I am his precious little princess.</font> His love and adoration for me gives me all the security I'd ever need! My gramma Jean is at the checkout. When she gives me permission to run back and grab some cream cheese and chocolote, I also scooped up my Mommy's favorite candy, hoping that Gramma would add that to our selection and I could give it to her later. My hopes became reality because Gramma is generous too.&nbsp;<br /><br />I din't realize this until I woke up, but it was the most AMAZING feeling to be <strong><font color=""#ff9900"" size=""3"">protected</font></strong> and <strong><font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""3"">loved</font></strong> and <strong><font color=""#ffff00"" size=""3"">adored</font></strong> and <strong><font color=""#00ff00"" size=""3"">secure</font></strong> and <strong><font color=""#ffcc99"" size=""3"">taken care of</font></strong> with the privilaged ability to <strong><font color=""#33cccc"" size=""3"">give</font></strong> to someone else who I care about.<br /><br />That was only the first in a string of dreams..&nbsp; some even&nbsp;nightmarish.. but it was the only one I wish to share.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would give ANYTHING to shrink back down to a little girl and have a daddy who made me the <font size=""6""><em><font color=""#ff99cc"">Princess</font></em>.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br />READ MY WORDS CAREFULLY:&nbsp;<br /><br />I would have had all the love and security and adoration I needed right at home..&nbsp;If BOTH my parents loved me like one did, my life would have been paradise. I would not have&nbsp;had to look elsewhere. I would&nbsp;have had real guidance, and real HEALTHY reassurance from my own family. I wouldn't have attatched&nbsp;to temporary people, I wouldn't have&nbsp;had my heart ripped out beyond repair. I wouldn't have sunk into any state of depression, I wouldn't have made horrible&nbsp;sporatic decisions. I would have had&nbsp;control of my life, I would have been too secure to mess it up. I would have&nbsp;developped the ability to cope, instead of lashing out. I would never have touched a cigarette. I would learned wisdom, instead of rebellion. My needs would have been met, so I&nbsp;would have put others before myself. &nbsp;I would have had the drive to stick with college, and I would still be living at home. I would have been working. I would have been saving money. I would have a car. I wouldn't have EVER drank and drove. I would still be pure. I would be active. I would have made better choises in friends from the start. I would have done no harm to myself or others. I would be in church. I would have excellent grades. I would have excellent focus. I would have excellent time-organization skills. I would&nbsp;have not been in the position to encounter life-draining distractions.&nbsp;I would have developed to my full potential. I would be on the fast-track to a carreer. I would have known exactly what to do when I needed to. I have more tallent in my little finger than he'll ever have.... and I would have learned to use it. <br /><br /><font size=""4"">Everything would have been different. <em><font color=""#ff6600"">EVERYTHING.</font></em></font>"

"event","<p>I find things wrong&nbsp;my boyfriend. I hate it when I do that... he's sooooo good to me, and he deserves my complete respect and utter devotion. He is devoted to me, and he loves me so much, maybe more that I understand.</p>
<p>Trouble is,&nbsp;I feel like I've&nbsp;actually had perfection before. It's not natural to have perfection, so I think there was a glitch in the system.</p>
<p>That glitch was me. I knew&nbsp;I wasn't SUPPOSED&nbsp;to allow myself such attatchment to a non-Christian, but I rebelled against God's plan&nbsp;Free Will allowed me to be with Jan, but not without concequences.&nbsp;I was not supposed to see&nbsp;such perfection on&nbsp;earth, so now I am seeing the reprecussions....&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I am cursed... cursed to expect perfection with my new Christian&nbsp;love, cursed to be upset when it's not there, cursed to long for perfection again, cursed to never be satisfied,&nbsp;cursed to have that little tiny portion of emptiness in my heart, cursed to only be 98.8% happy for the rest of my life. </p>
<p>It's like dying, going to Heaven and experiencing complete bliss.. then being shoved back into your body on this big stupid rock. Life will never be the same, regardless of how good you have it.</p>
<p>UNLESS I re-train my brain to be satisfied with 1.2 % less that perfection. Can I do it???</p>
<p>Grampa helped. He pointed out in a&nbsp;silly way&nbsp;that I'M not perfect either, so it's not like it's a huge deal if my boyfriend isn't. I completley agree. I just wish I could REMEMBER that every time I feel the sadness again. I'm working on it. Slowely, but surely, my brain will be re-trained. </p>
<p>I know.. I'll pray for the ability to accept and cope. I've found that if I pray, the things I pray for will come in their own time. Time.. I hate waiting. I must also remember to pray for patience. God has been trying to teach me patience&nbsp;for years now... I'm getting better with that, but not quite there. I still can't stand waiting. </p>"

I got a little tiny visit for 2 days (first time in LOTSA months), I'm not as tired, I can wake up earlier easier, I can fall asleep earlier easier, my hair isn't as dry as it's been, I have a (somewhat) higher sex drive lately, haven't had any panic or anxiety issues lately.

However, It doesn't seem like i'm losing any weight, I still have a hard time handlign heat, still gettin headaches, still thirsty, still have dry skin, and i'm DEFINITELY still retaining fluid.&nbsp;

I don't know what all of this means. When I try to think, ""hmmmm maybe everything will go away on it's own!"" someone tells me, ""no Jodi, it won't go away, you have to get it fixed.&nbsp;Which is ok.. I have an appointment.&nbsp;

I got to hang out with Melody yesterday for the first time in YEARS! I was so excited, and I feel like a dork saying that, but it's true. But hey, wouldn't YOU be excited to see YOUR friend if you hadn't seen her in a long time? I helped her pack her kitchen stuff. I threw some stuff around but we got like 5 boxes done. It doesn't seem like a lot, but trust me, it took a looooong time!

I really wanna see her and Adam today, but Matt wants me to go to Wally Werld right now and Melody has to clean things b/c someone's going there at 6 to see the place and then she has to pick her hubby up at 8 and I haven't even called Adamus yet. I'm really hot. Which is why we're going to get a fuse and get the air-conditioner running again. LATR"

YES those 2 things <em>have</em> hurt me, and YES during my 9th grade year I <em>did</em> ask God to take them away for a while. He did, but then slowly gave them back as he saw fit. It's a known belief that <font color=""#cc99ff"">God will never give you more than you can handle</font>, and&nbsp;those gifts have&nbsp;yet to be completely returned. I was also a natural ""people person"" until that whole burger king fiasco (the whole 9 months). I'm pretty sure I was there for a specific purpose as well; to meet and fall in love with Matthew Jackson. But&nbsp;nothing more.&nbsp;I'm pretty sure BK is most of the reason I have no more tolerence for people. That and high testosterone levels (Matt says I'm acting like I'm on steriods).&nbsp;But BK is over, I can get treatment for the hormone thing, and I'm sure God will fully restore compassion and empathy.&nbsp;Also, I was thinking since I'm not really depressed anymore, I could&nbsp;go back to&nbsp;HACC and be&nbsp;succesfully productive.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've also been predisposed to have a strong desire to&nbsp;help&nbsp;victims of abuse. It's not like I&nbsp;personally had a horrible life; it was pretty decent (I know my mom made sure of that).&nbsp;No physical abuse, no neglect. Just&nbsp;some verbal and emotional trauma. Although I <em>thought</em> I couldn't handle it, &nbsp;God knew otherwise. I was told by a reliable source that <font color=""#cc99ff"">God sent protection for me so I wouldn't have to take the full blow.</font> I think the only&nbsp;reason He allowed <em>some</em> abuse was to ignite a fierce passion in me.. a passion that would later spark the deep and urgent need to help children who are in REAL danger.&nbsp;<br /><br />Regardless of my enthusiasm, I'll be the first to admit that&nbsp;I still feel like a helpless child, and I'm still unstable in almost every sense of the word. <font size=""4""><strong>I'm scared.</strong></font> I'm scared I won't get that $250 to pay the debt from my drop-out in 2003 and won't be able to sign up, I'm scared I won't get the money to pay for courses this fall, I'm scared I'll miss classes again if I do enroll, I'm scared I'll procrastinate on the assignments, I'm scared I'll be too stressed to handle it all, I'm scared I'll get bad grades, I'm scared I won't graduate, I'm scared I won't get a job if I do graduate.&nbsp;<br /><br />My biggest fear however, is the job itself, assuming it even happens.&nbsp;What if by then I'm still unstable? What if my tolerance toward people is still low, what if I'm too shy by then,&nbsp;what if I can't handle the <font color=""#ff00ff"">heartbreak</font> of the profession, what if I can't handle the <font color=""#ff00ff"">stress</font> of the workload, what if I can't even get the hang of the job tasks, what if I get myself in over my head, what if I end up crying every day when I get home, what if I end up crying at work, <font size=""3""><em>what if I end up screaming and hurling objects across the room like I did at burger king?</em></font><br /><br /><font size=""4"">I'm so confused by the signs!!!</font> Everything happens for a reason, right? My childhood and teen years lead to the indescribable urge to make a difference in young people's&nbsp;lives, but this instibility resulting from those years attributed to me dropping out the first time and now not having the money to go back. Which side of that do I listen to? It would be easiest to say, ""Nevermind, it obviously wasn't meant to be."" But then I'll feel like even more of a deadbeat, and my anger and distaste&nbsp;for life will continue.&nbsp;<br /><br />The answer may be obvious, but I'm still broke, and I still have to fix the medical issues. Summer's come and Fall is just around the corner. Even <em>without</em> my usual procrastination, it seems like too much to handle and seriously,&nbsp;<strong><font size=""3""><em>all I wanna do is sleep.</em></font>&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />I repeat, <font size=""5"">I NEED HELP!!!<br /></font><br /></p>"

Then some bitch blond and her brunette friend appeared.. the blonde was sifting through my jewelry. I jumped off the rock and I&nbsp;was RIGHT THERE but I couldn't stop her. Nomatter how loud I yelled, my voice was still quiet and it was hard to get Grampa's attention. But when I did, he just simply stated, ""Jewelry isn't that important."" So she got away. I sat there with Grampa and tried to let it go.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br />I used to be an innocent pacifist, helpless and walked upon, broken and conditioned, sad instead of angry. I had no power, I just let everything go. I knew that small things would not matter in the end. I didn't believe I was capable of putting forth any effort to take control, I just let it roll. <br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">But I couldn't let go of things anymore! With determination in my voice, I told Grampa, ""I""m getting my jewelry back!"" He said, ""OK"" and watched me run after the bitch. I stomped up to 2 brunettes and was about to yell at them. They looked scared but then I realized it wasn't them. ""Nevermind,"" was the only consulation or explanation I offered them. I took off, inspected some others, passed them, then asked someone else, ""Have you seen..."" I stopped mid-sentense..&nbsp;<br /></font><br />I can't be a&nbsp;PASSIVE LITTLE WIMP&nbsp;anymore! On my mission for power, I find myself screaming and lashing out at mostly-innocent bystanders. They are not the main problem, but I am blinded by anger and cannot tell the diff right away. After I take it out on them and&nbsp;realize they are not the culprit, I offer no real explanation. I give it little thought, as I'm still searching for the REAL cause of my rage.<br /><em><br /><font color=""#00ff00"">TARGET SPOTTED.</font></em><font color=""#00ff00"">&nbsp; When I started to run toward her, she took off and left her purse. I knew my stuff MIGHT be in there, but I decided to make sure I got her anyway in case she was wearing some of it. I&nbsp;yelled after her&nbsp;and chased her down, and it was a good move b/c she kept dropping my stuff as she ran. I bent down to pick it all up with fear that I might be harmed while I was down. But I was just fine.&nbsp;<br /></font><br />In my dream, I find the REAL enemy. Instead of pausing at possibility, I go for what would no doubt lead me to the solution. I know it's the right choice because it works. As I'm picking up the pieces at my own risk, I am afraid of failure. But I did not fail!<br /><br />That bitch I'm hunting down is slightly heavy, pretty, long blonde hair, and NOT violent. I realize now that she is a previous version of ME.<br /><br /><font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""4"">I CONQUERED MYSELF!!!</font>&nbsp;<br /><br />So there's my answer.&nbsp; All I have to do to stop getting mad&nbsp;at everyone is FACE MY FEARS. According to this dream, I will stop being angry when I finally get ambitious enough achieve my goals. <br />"

I don't even mind that they dress like complete sluts.. I might&nbsp;do the same if I had the body. I do NOT get offended when I see half-naked girls, not in the slightest.

"event","I've come to the conclusion that I'm not as good of a person as I used to be. Matt says I still have a good heart, so that's a relief, and I believe it's true.&nbsp;&nbsp;But my behavior doesn't always refect it anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""3"">I used to have a heart pure as gold, exploding with <strong><em>care</em></strong> and <strong><em>concern</em></strong> and <strong><em>empathy</em></strong> and <strong><em>love</em></strong></font> for everyone who came across my path. Sometimes even those I've never met, even those I didn't know existed, even those not yet born,&nbsp;even those who were not yet&nbsp;even conceived,&nbsp;just because they would eventually exist. <em><font size=""3"">They already mattered&nbsp;in God's eyes,</font></em> so they did in mine. &nbsp;I never got angry at anyone, nomatter what they did to me, regardless of any horrendous acts they've committed against&nbsp;myself or another, and despite any sort of sickly personality traits&nbsp;that were displayed before me or anyone else. <font size=""4"">Every soul in existence was, in my&nbsp;eyes,&nbsp;composed of ratios higher in good rather than in evil.</font>&nbsp;<font size=""3"">God had formed me into an endless fountain of<em> <strong>unconditional</strong> <strong>love</strong>, <strong>tolerance</strong>,</em> and <em><strong>compassion</strong>.&nbsp;<br /></em></font><br />So what happened? Why am I so ANGRY lately?<font size=""3""> <strong>Is this my fault?</strong></font> It certainly isn't God's. Why do I throw tantrums&nbsp;like a small child would? How come, if I suppress these violent emotions in my waking life, they will surface in my subconcious as I lay dreaming... dreams of me <font size=""4"">screaming bloody-murder and throwing things</font> at whoever or whatever made me feel that way? Why is it that the ONLY way to prevent these dreams is to allow myself to ""spazz"" while I'm awake?&nbsp;And WHY, God, why why why.. WHY did I hang up on my Gramma last night?!?!?! I've never in my life done that before, and I never ever ever EVER thought I would!!! Why has my tolerance level dropped and fallen full-speed off a jagged skyscraping cliff???<br /><br />I don't like it. While I may enjoy feeling a wide range of emotion, I don't approve of lashing out. <font size=""3"">I feel rediculous.</font> I hate feeling <strong>anger</strong> and <strong>irritation</strong>&nbsp;as my primary emotions, I HATE hurting&nbsp;people's feelings. Matt told me that when I snap at people (mainly him) without thinking, the frontal lobe of my brain goes numb.&nbsp;<br /><br />You know what? With that last&nbsp;statement,&nbsp;I think I may have just stumbled upon a possible explanation to my behavior. And that scares the crap outa me. I've been completely clean for over a year now, but... <font size=""4""><em>I did it to myself.</em></font>&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok, that may be a large cause, but I think I'd like to explore other contributions as well. Here goes:<br /><br /><br />-I left 1/2 my heart and most of my soul in the Czech Republic = broken heart, lonliness, constantly sinking sadness<br /><br />-Started HACC, dropped out 2 months later = feelings of failure and guilt<br /><br />-""Emotional abuse"" from home = <font size=""3""><strong><em>PAIN, HELPLESSNESS,&nbsp;RESENTMENT, HATRED, TANTRUMS</em></strong>, <strong><em>RAGE!!!</em></strong></font><br /><br />-Degrated myself&nbsp;sporatically for&nbsp;2 years = feelings of worthlessness, disappointment, emptiness<br /><br />-Altered my brain sporatically for 2 years = brain-damage/ loss of seritonin?<br /><br />-Took anti-depressants for 7 months, then stopped due to lack of insurence = abrubt brain alterations?<br /><br />-Quit Kirby = feelings of failure and guilt<br /><br />-Burger King for a year = Unbelievable STRESS and plummeting tolerance for people<br /><br />-Lack of money = helplessness, stress, fear<br /><br />OK, that's enough for now. I didn't completely put it together before, but now I suppose the above statements need little explanation.&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""3"">So, once innocence has been lost, thrown away,&nbsp;or stolen, </font><font size=""4""><em>can it ever be restored???</em></font><em><font size=""4""> <br /></font></em><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Ok, so maybe I <em>don't</em> know what's wrong with me.&nbsp;Ya know how I thought I knew what was wrong with me and I was so excited that everything was so simple and I was gonna be JUST FINE....&nbsp;<br /><br />I got a nice little <strong><font color=""#cc99ff"">wake-up call</font></strong> from the doctor's office today.&nbsp;They said they recieved the rest of my test results. I was unaware that I had more coming, so it severely cought me by surprise. I thought it was just my thyroid that was the problem, so when they told me that my testosterone levels were high and they want to do an <font color=""#ff9900"">INTERNAL ultrasound</font> to check for polycistic ovaries, I completely spazzed and cried uncontrollably for like, 20 minutes.&nbsp;<br /><br />I KNOW that it's not a huge deal, I can think of 3 people off the top of my head that have that problem, and they're just fine.&nbsp; I guess it was just that I&nbsp;was&nbsp;told a week ago that <font color=""#ff99cc"" size=""3"">""Everything was normal except this ONE little thing that you fix with pills...""</font> and then the shock a week later that, <font size=""3""><font color=""#ff00ff"">""Oh yeah, you might also have this other thing that you thought you didn't have last week, but we won't know for sure&nbsp;until we </font><em><strong><font color=""#ff00ff"">SHOVE A LONG METAL OBJECT THROUGH YOUR CERVIX.""<br /></font></strong><br /></em></font><font size=""2"">Matt, being the total sweetheart that he is, held me and told me everything was gonna be ok. He offered to call off work, but I wouldn't let him, not on his first week. Especially since I'll need him on the 2nd to actually deal with the appointment. While I was driving him to work, he&nbsp;suggested that&nbsp;I&nbsp;sue them for the trauma it caused me. Ha, sweet thought, but no. It was MY fault I didn't get all the info at once because I called and asked for the results before they had all of them back. I just wish they would have <strong><font color=""#ff6600"" size=""3"">TOLD ME THAT</font></strong> instead of letting me think there was nothing more.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I was crying again on the way home from dropping off Matt, God told me that everything was going to be ok by sending me some rain. That might sound odd to most people, but it's true. It seems that whenever I'm feeling too down or if it doesn't seem as if I can handle my emotions, God&nbsp;sprinkles&nbsp;little drops&nbsp;of Heaven&nbsp;to&nbsp;comfort me. I stood outside, looked up through the&nbsp;leaves and the rain,&nbsp;and I&nbsp;thanked Him.&nbsp;<font size=""5""><font color=""#ccffff""><em>It was raining for</em> <em>ME</em>.</font></font> <br /><br />I was wishing for it to continue, but He knew I had gotten what I needed. Just as it was raining for me, I suppose He needed to let the sun shine for someone else. It's just as well.. now I can go for a walk with Tabitha. I think she needs me. She calmed me down earlier, so now it's my turn to be there for her. And I'm glad I can be. &lt;3</font>"

"event","Ok, so last week I decided to use my insurence to go to the, um, <em>doctor, </em>you know, to finally see what's wrong with me. I mean, my main concern is that I need to be able to have kids someday. Well, not being able to is one of my biggest fears. Soooo I wanted to go check that out.&nbsp;<br /><br />They took <font color=""#ff0000""><strong><font size=""3"">5 tubes</font></strong> of <strong><font size=""3"">blood</font></strong> </font>from my arm, and &nbsp;LET&nbsp;&nbsp;ME&nbsp; TELL&nbsp; YOU&nbsp; &nbsp;that was the LONGEST time I've ever had to sit there with a needle in my vein. It freaked me out soooo bad, but I didn't totally cry. Just a few&nbsp;tears drizzlin' down my discruntled face.&nbsp;Which is a <strong>huge</strong> step from the first time.&nbsp;<br /><br />So today, I finally got ahold of the nurse, and she told me that everything was normal except the <strong>T</strong>hyroid <strong>S</strong>timulating <strong>H</strong>ormone levels were high. That means that the petuitary thing is sending A LOT of TSH to my Thyroid to try to get it to work. That's how they know that the Thyroid isn't working right. They called it an <font color=""#ffcc00"" size=""3"">""Underactive Thyroid.""&nbsp;<br /></font><br />Not only does this condition cause irregularity (in my case, EXTREME irregularity), it also can cause&nbsp;overly dry skn, extra weight, and SLUGGISHNESS. <br /><br />Lately I've been using lotion like mad (I don't know if it was dry to begin with b/c I don't give it the chance), but when the nurse told me about that tiredness stuff, my jaw just dropped, and I was like<font size=""3""> <font color=""#00ff00""><strong>""ARE YOU SEEEEERRRIOUSSS????""</strong></font></font> She laughed, but to me it was <font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""3"">music to my ears.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you have any idea what it's like to sleep 12 or 13 hours, check the clock, see you've been in bed waaaayyyyy toooo looonnggg, get <font color=""#ff0000"" size=""3"">stressed</font> out about how you should have been up doing things, so you dddrrraaaaggggg your ass out bed, hoping to work up some energy to do something productive, only to discover that you feel too tired and out-of-it care about being alive? You can walk around, but you still feel like you're draggin' ass.&nbsp; EVERY DAY. Never changes. <br /><br />Now imagine&nbsp;that EVERYBODY around you, your Mom, you job,&nbsp;and your friends, have been&nbsp;on your case for YEARS about you being too damned &nbsp;<font size=""5"">L A Z Y </font>&nbsp;to hop outa bed and be productive and be happy about life.&nbsp; Imagine you, YOURSELF, getting so angry and beeting yourself up internally because you're sooo damned <font color=""#ff0000"" size=""3"">FRUSTRATED</font> at what a <font color=""#ffcc00"" size=""3"">pathetic lazy LOOSER</font> you are.&nbsp;Well, <font size=""3"">that's how I've been feeling. <strong>A LOT.</strong></font>&nbsp;<br /><br />And now all of a sudden some gynocologist orders a lot of blood work, and some nurse tells me <font color=""#00ff00"" size=""3"">THERE'S A REASON!!!</font> It's not JUST because I'm a lazy looser!!! <font color=""#ff0000"">O</font><font color=""#ff9900"">M</font><font color=""#ffff00"">I</font><font color=""#00ff00"">G</font><font color=""#00ffff"">O</font><font color=""#cc99ff"">S</font><font color=""#ff0000"">H</font>, you cannot even begin to understand how <font color=""#ffff00"">happy</font> I am, I was actually in <font color=""#00ffff"" size=""4"">""happy tears""</font> because I was just so <font color=""#cc99ff"">excited</font> and grateful to finally have an answer! I've been so happy all day, <font color=""#ff0000"" size=""3"">SO</font> <font size=""3""><font color=""#ff6600"">SO</font> <font color=""#ffff00"">SO</font> <font color=""#00ff00"">SO</font> <font color=""#00ffff"">SO</font> <font color=""#cc99ff"">SO</font> <strong><font color=""#ff0000"">SO</font></strong> <strong><font color=""#ff6600"">ha</font><font color=""#ffff00"">pp</font><font color=""#00ff00"">y!</font><font color=""#00ffff"">!!</font></strong></font> Not to mention the <font color=""#ff0000"">overly joyous</font> feeling I get when I realize that <font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""4"">IT CAN BE FIXED!</font> Meaning there will be no problem with having kids.<strong> </strong><font color=""#ff9900"" size=""3"">I CAN HAVE KIDS!!!!!!!!!</font> <font size=""4""><font color=""#00ffff"">My worst fear has been revoked!</font><br /></font><br />Don't get me wrong, I know it got worse when I started smoking more, and when I started eating at Burger King every day. That part IS my fault. But&nbsp;I've never been ""normal.""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've never felt entirely rested. So I'm guess that this ""underactive thyroid"" has always been a problem, at least since I was 13. It's just a lot worse lately.&nbsp;<br /><br />So thure ya have it. I'm off to go shmoke a ciggy and slather myself with some more lotion. LATERRRRR!!!<br /><br />"

Tomorrow -- TODAY -- is my day off.&nbsp; 1 of the 2 precious days a week I get to spend however the heck I want to.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I've got a precious li'l kitty on my lap named Jasper and I <font size=""4"">love</font> him but I just wish I could type with 2 hands and pet him at the same time.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've just shmoked the night's last cigarette.. wish I didn't have to.&nbsp; I wish I could quit. Well... I wish I could quit without screaming and bawling my eyes out over every little thing. I wish I could quit without craving mad chocolate.&nbsp; I don't even eat sweets that much as it is.. why do I NEEEEED them when I'm havin a nic fit??? So yeah.. I'm stuck at 3 -&nbsp;6 a day and it sucks. Although still better than 8 - 11 like I used to.&nbsp;<br /><br />What's the point of this blogger?&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I'm just annoyed at my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If I sleep now, I won't&nbsp;wake up 'till 3-ish,&nbsp;4-ish.&nbsp; That leaves me with 4 or 5&nbsp;hours of daylight.&nbsp; 4 or 5&nbsp;puney little hours to enjoy God's beautiful day. ""Oh, why don't&nbsp;you just wake up earlier, Jodi???""&nbsp; <font size=""4""><em>DOI DOI DOI WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?!?!</em><font size=""3""><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></font><font size=""2"">Maybe I'm not gonna do it because&nbsp;THEN I would feel like shit, leaving no point to&nbsp;the day whatsoever.&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><font size=""2"">However, my little Matthew has been snoozin' like a baby with his head burried&nbsp;under the blanket that Adrianna gave us for like, the ENTIRE night.&nbsp; Oh how I envy him.&nbsp; ""Oh, but Jodi, why didn't YOU just go to sleep at the same time???"" </font></font><font size=""4""><em>DER DER DER WHY THE&nbsp;HECK DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?!?!&nbsp; </em><font size=""2"">O&nbsp;gee&nbsp;MAYBE&nbsp;I didn't do it because&nbsp;I hadn't even been awake 9 hours before he sacked out. Besides, I just can't miss Law and&nbsp;Order: CI, Law and Order: SVU, Roseanne, Roseanne, Roseanne,&nbsp;Some other show, Mad&nbsp;About You, Mad About You,&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and The Cosby Show. <strong>Jeezer weezers!!!<br /></strong></font><br /><font size=""2"">Not to mention I HAVE to wake up before 4 to go&nbsp;renew my license because right now I'm illegal to drive.&nbsp; Even though&nbsp;it might be suspended shortly for a DUI I had back in August or September anyway, I don't even know.&nbsp;&nbsp;AND I need to schedule a very much needed&nbsp;doctor's appointment. Which ALSO has to be done before 4-sh.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, and&nbsp;I want to schedule fall classes at HACC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should probably get up before 4 to do that one, too.&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><font size=""2"">Tonight when I got home from&nbsp;a long dumb&nbsp;busy day at work, there was a lovely little email waiting for me from none other than..&nbsp;<font size=""4"">DUN dun <strong>DUN</strong>...</font> <font size=""3""><strong>MY&nbsp;X-BOYFRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND.</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought, Oh crud,&nbsp;what's she gonna say... this could be&nbsp;ok, bad, or interesting, to say the least.&nbsp; WELL she wasn't completly mean.&nbsp; Eva typed decently calm, but she blamed&nbsp;me for her abortion she had over a&nbsp;year ago.&nbsp; That made me upset, but I&nbsp;didn't even know about it.&nbsp; Even if I <strong>had</strong>, I WOULD NOT have told her to abort <font color=""#ff6600"">Jan's</font> baby!&nbsp; That baby would have been just as precious as he is.&nbsp; But it's ok, I realize that she's&nbsp;distraught about it and needs somebody to&nbsp;blame.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's also very upset that&nbsp;<font color=""#ff6600"">Jan</font> and I still email each other.&nbsp; Actually, I think it's more that I still&nbsp;tell him I love him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well ya know what?&nbsp;&nbsp;I still bawl my eyes out over him!&nbsp; She took him from&nbsp;ME, not the other way around.&nbsp; I still need contact, I still need his friendship.&nbsp; I NEED to tell him I love him, just the same as I would tell my best friends I love THEM. (Adrianna, Danielle,&nbsp;Adam, and Emily to name a few).&nbsp;&nbsp;I was annoyed by her anger; he was my little <font color=""#ff6600"">red-headed</font>&nbsp;<font color=""#ff6600"">chunk of Czech </font>first, I loved him before she did!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />However, <strong>I understand&nbsp;her state&nbsp;of mind.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have someone as amazing as <font color=""#ff6600"">Jan</font>, you do everything in your power to hold onto him.&nbsp; That was my mistake.&nbsp; My mistake was getting on that damned plane home.&nbsp; I <em>did</em> try to console her in the&nbsp;""reply email""...&nbsp;you see, she AND&nbsp;Jan told me that she,&nbsp;like, FREAKS OUT every time my name is mentioned.&nbsp; (Don't get me wrong, I'm glad my name still has significance in&nbsp;the Czech Republic) but I didn't tell her that.&nbsp; I told her that next time my name is mentioned, I hope that she will remember that SHE is there with him now, and I am not.&nbsp; Well, I hope it&nbsp;helps <strong><em>her</em></strong> that I said that, because<em> <font size=""4"">it makes ME wanna&nbsp;jump off a bridge.</font></em>&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><font size=""2"">But hey, ya know that part in the last paragraph where I said you wanna hold onto someone as amazing as <font color=""#ff6600"">Jan</font>?&nbsp;&nbsp;After&nbsp;<strong>2&nbsp;LOOONG YEARS,&nbsp;</strong>another one finally found me.&nbsp; His name is <font color=""#ffcc00"">Matthew Jackson.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I was still holding onto&nbsp;<font color=""#ff6600"">Jan</font>, but I finally gave in, and&nbsp;I don't regret it&nbsp;one bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=""#ffcc00"">Matt</font> is&nbsp;wonderful to me,&nbsp;and this time I plan on doing&nbsp;it right.&nbsp; I love him&nbsp;a whooole bunch!&nbsp;&nbsp;I got&nbsp;on that damned plane home for a reason, right?&nbsp; I didn't realize it at the time, but now&nbsp;<font color=""#ffcc00"">Matt</font> and I believe that God had a plan for us that was different than our own separate ones.&nbsp; We were stubborn, but God finally&nbsp;plopped us both into&nbsp;each other's lives.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So if this is God's plan, hey?&nbsp; Who am I to argue?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think I'll send this blog to <font color=""#ff6600"">Jan</font>.&nbsp; Or at&nbsp;least ask him to check it out. <br /></font><br /><br /></font><br />&nbsp;"

"event","<p>currently reading: <strong><u>Mortal Fear</u></strong> by Robin Cook<br /></p>
<p>Matt was at Herb's house for the evening.&nbsp; I had just taken a hot&nbsp;shower and snuggled into my teal fuzzy robe.&nbsp; I decided to move the lamp to the corner of the counter overhanging our bed so that it was in the perfect position to light up my reading area.&nbsp; The next step to comfort was a necesity, as the creaks in the celing and tapping of the pipes were making me a little too tense for my liking.&nbsp; The unwelcomed noises&nbsp;were easily&nbsp;masked&nbsp;by a computer&nbsp;playlist of Led Zepelin set on random, the volume&nbsp;turned up <em>just</em> right; enough to hear&nbsp;the music clearly, but not enough to be a&nbsp;distraction. &nbsp;I proceded to light up a stick of patchouli incense.&nbsp;The gentle aroma eased into the air, providing a lovely mystic comfort.&nbsp;Next,&nbsp;I&nbsp;gathered up all 5 pillows and fluffed them&nbsp;in the form of a perfect poofy nest against the 2 walls.&nbsp; Grabbing my book on the way, I&nbsp;finally&nbsp;got the chance to crawl under the comforter, curl up in the corner, and settle in.&nbsp; Glancing over, I saw that our sweet little Jasper had snuggled right into the scene. I leaned back with a slight smile and opened up my novel&nbsp;to where I left off. <font size=""4""><em>Ahhhh</em>... coziness at it's best!</font> </p>

"event","Meeting Sam was awesome! I wish I could call him my dad, but after 15 years of Mom calling him Sam, it's kinda weird. He came to our hotel and gave me a <strong>cuddly pink teddy bear</strong>, which was so so nice, I can't even begin to describe how happy that made me, although I was still acting rather timid and silent. Gramma had him look at a whole buncha albums with baby pics of me in them, but I didn't really know what to say. I guess it didn't matter b/c Gramma did most of the talking. He took us out to lunch at a restaurant on the beach, paid for everything, then drove us further down the beach cuz I wanted to walk out on the peir (however you spell that) and basically it seemed like whatever I wanted, he would bend over backwards to do. And I was in the front wherever we went... but that wasn't a problem because his car had sooo much room in it for everyone. I forget what kind of car he has, though. He dropped us off at the hotel, and came back later that night with <strong>Katie</strong>, his 7-year-old. He said she was really excited to meet <strong>her big sister</strong> and wanted to come with to pick me up. I didn't really know what to say to her, but when I first layed eyes on her my heart melted into a big pile of mush. She's so precious! And she's <em>my</em> little sister. :-) <br /><br />On the way to his house we got to talk one-on-one, which came naturally. I don't remember every detail, but I got to ask questions, got answers, talked about my life, his life, that type of thing. Robin (his wife) was so nice, their house was lovely (with a pool in the back), and the kids were just darling.. Katie showed me her room, <strong>Sammie</strong> (he's 13) was quiet at first but then started talking to me, it was really cool. When I looked at them I smiled, and I just wanted to&nbsp;cry, I&nbsp;was so emotional, but you know kids aren't like that so I fought back the tears and controlled&nbsp;them to a dull eye-watering.&nbsp;That visit lasted maybe an hour and 1/2, because by then it was 9, Katie's bed-time. Sammie and Sam are night people, like me. they're both about my height, and they're both a little heavier than normal, like me. They have to work at it, which is why I'm not a little thin thing like Mom and Tanya. Good to know there's a reason other than my laziness! On the way back to the hotel, I got to talk to him more, which was awesome, I could tell he cares so much, he said he loves me, and he's really talkative and friendly and caring in general and an awesome listener, just like I am, all of it, so it just seemed so natural that he was supposed to be my dad, ya know? When we were back at the hotel he asked if he could walk me up, and I just started laughin, like <em>""Are you kidding!? Of course!""</em> We got up to the door, but before we went in, he used that moment to have a heart-to-heart, sincerely telling me that if there's ANYTHING I ever need, he would be there for me. So then he came in and Gramma chatted his ear off some more (LOL) and then he departed for the evening. <br /><br />The next morning he came to join us as we were getting done with breakfast. The plan was to see us off, but he ended up staying for maybe an hour, then leaving to let us pack and be on our way. <br /><br /><em>(I'll type about the next part of the trip some other time, it was a lovely vacation, I'd like to have this documented as well.)</em> <br /><br />I called Sam the morning we were traveling back to Fort Lauderdale, and he told us to let us know 1/2 hour before we reached the airport. So I did. We got to the airport, and I have to mention the elevator because it was hillarious... we waited, got in, pushed the 4 button, got up there, but it looked like it was wrong. There was a guy who worked there pushing something too big to fit in the elevator with all of us, so he just stayed there. We're just like, ""oh no, this isn't the right floor!"" So Gramma pushed the 2 and the 1 button, but when we got to 2, we were like, ""Oh no! we had to be on 4!"" So we went to 1, stayed there, the door closed again, and we waited 'till we got back up to 4. Just before the door opened, Grampa was laughing and said, ""Now watch, that same guy'll be standin' there..."" so the door opened and yeah, that same guy was standing there... we all busted up laughing histerically, along with that guy who was standing there.. That was fun! LOL! <br /><br />Ooooookay, we finally got our bags checked, when Sam came around behind us laughin about what a nutty time he had getting to us, said he drove in the wrong place and asked some lady how to get to us, and she said he could walk, ""it's about 5 minutes that way."" Ooooh goodness, that darned airport! it had ALLLL of us confused! But Sam said with a laugh, ""It's ok, I was up for the challenge!"" So we visited for maybe 45 minutes until we decided it was time to go through the gates. I didn't want to go, and I told him so, because it was the last time I'd see him for a while, maybe years. And I was just so sad that I couldn't really be a part of his kids' lives. I would be leaving the 3 of them, and it seriously breaks my heart. He understood, and he told me, <em>""Well, just get your life together back in PA, then we'll see what happens.""</em> I hugged Gramma and Grampa goodbye, then Sam kissed me on the cheek and hugged me tight. Sam, Gramma, and Grampa watched us as Matt and I stood in line to go though the gates. I watched as Sam said his goodbyes to Gramma and Grampa, and also as he went to the escalators. I think it was hard for him too, because his caring eyes and warm smile were in my direction while he was leaving. I though this in my head, but then&nbsp;said to Matt outloud, <em><font size=""4"">""There goes the man that would have been my dad.""</font></em> Matt replied, <font size=""4""><em>""Jodi, he</em> IS <em>your dad.""</em></font> That made me feel a little better. Sam and I smiled at each other as the escalator carried him down and out of sight. <br /><br />Since I've been home, 3 nights in a row went by in which Sam, Sammie, and Katie appeared in my dreams. I just can't get them out of my head! It's ok though, because I don't want them out of my head. I was only with them for a short time, but I miss them. That's my <font size=""4"">dad</font>, my little <font size=""4"">brother</font>, and my little <font size=""4"">sister</font> I'm thinking about. <strong><em><font size=""5"">WOW</font></em></strong>.<br /><br />I don't think I can describe how much I need him, how much I wish he had been there for me my entire life, how sad I am that I've been deprived of my daddy ALL THESE YEARS!&nbsp;I just wanna be a little girl again, curl up on daddy's lap, give him a big ol' kiss on the cheek, and say, <em>""I love you daddy!""</em> And I want him to refer to me as <em>""daddy's little girl</em>"" like he does with Katie. But those times have passed, and&nbsp;I never got the chance.&nbsp;But Sam says the way he lives is in the moment, like I do, so I guess we'll see what lies ahead in the moments of the future. He's an extreme optimist, and I'd like to be as well, so our outlook status has no choice but to be positive. :-)"

I mean it <em>can't</em> be the whole reason.&nbsp;I <em>cheat</em>. When&nbsp;I get anxious or when&nbsp;I start yelling about EVERYTHING or when&nbsp;I start bawling for small reasons, I'll take baby hits and blow some puffs out before they even hit my lungs..&nbsp; just try to get enough nicotine to stop the madness. And it works.&nbsp;<br /><br />But lately.. I'm just going <strong>NUTS</strong>. Internally, about bad things.. horrible things, things that&nbsp;I can't control. Outwardly about little stupid things..&nbsp;I want to <font size=""3""><strong>yell</strong></font> and <strong><font size=""3"">scream</font></strong> about every tiny little thing that happens to my slightest disliking.&nbsp;I might be driving everyone nuts. I'm driving Matt nuts,&nbsp;I know <em>that</em> much.

So I'm left to sit back, listen, pretend to be calm, pretend to let everything go, wait for things to work themselves out.&nbsp;I'm expected to&nbsp;forget the past that I HEARD about from angry children, the past that&nbsp;I HEARD about from a sad mother, forget the present that I'm seeing for myself, forget the negative events from&nbsp;the&nbsp;past <font size=""5"">that I had</font>, let those damned ""events"" go, not let&nbsp;them effect me, not let it effect how I react while HEARING what has happened, while seeing what's happening&nbsp;RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY&nbsp;FACE, just forget <strong><font size=""3"">everything</font></strong> and be an <font size=""5"">emotionless little sponge that's supposed to listen and care to a degree but&nbsp;not&nbsp;get&nbsp;so&nbsp;damned <strong><em>ANGRY</em></strong></font> about it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""5""> <font size=""2"">I believed that <em><font size=""3"">all people are generally good at heart.</font></em> And I'm PRETTY SURE that I still hold that belief in my <em>own</em> heart.

"event","<P>that's Czech for ""i don't know what to do...""</P>
<P>for the first time in 2 months i was alone for about 3 hours at my house. and for the first time in a long time i remembered what it was like to be cold, sad, alone, and just sorta blank. i used to feel like that all the time, almost every night until matt rescued me. but the really odd and moronic thing is, i kinda miss it.&nbsp;which kinda makes me wonder,&nbsp;do&nbsp;some people <EM>like</EM> being depressed???&nbsp;sometimes it seems that way.&nbsp;i mean i don't miss the hopelessness, that part can just go back to hell where it came from and stay there. i just mean that it was just a familiar feeling, something i got very used to. maybe i mean that i was ok to not feel like i have to try to smile like i do when i'm with people. i was allowed to feel whatever the heck i was feeling instead of subconciously masking it&nbsp;like i always do, if there's something to mask. don't get me wrong, i'm truly content being cared for and secure and loved by Matt. he saved me from all that hopelessness crap, and that's how i want it to stay.. <STRONG>forever</STRONG>. i want to be happy, and with Matt and God, i know my life will be amazing in it's own way.</P>
<P>this is a poem i wrote on march 28, 2003. i think&nbsp;i'll finally share it now. <BR><BR><EM><STRONG><U>HEADACHE FROM HELL</U></STRONG><BR>I wish my headache would go away<BR>It haunts me every day<BR>Huge<BR>Overbearing<BR>In my brain<BR>Pounding<BR>Tearing<BR>All the way through my head<BR>Like an anvil made of lead<BR>Tylenol can't touch it<BR>Motrin can't crunch it<BR>All the doctors on this earth<BR>Could not give birth<BR>To a cure for this curse<BR>I can't bear it another instant<BR>But he standing right inside the kitchen</EM></P>
<P>this is what's really getting me down. i wrapped all my presents tonight. i put the ones for my family under my tree.. well, for my mom and sister. there's something missing. it's not just the gifts that i don't buy for him, it's&nbsp;the lingering&nbsp;headache that i've <EM>sort of</EM>&nbsp;had my entire life, but peaked a little over a year ago.&nbsp;sometimes it subsides, sometimes i don't feel it at all. but sometimes it makes me nervous, sometimes scared, sometimes hateful, sometimes it hurts so bad that i can't hold back the tears, and sometimes i want to kill it for ruining my life. but when i really think about it, well.. yeah it really hurts. really bad.&nbsp;but it's Christmas.. and there's an emptiness that i&nbsp;feel really sad about, and it's not just under the tree.&nbsp;i can't&nbsp;allow myself to feel guilty, i didn't&nbsp;do anything wrong, i don't deserve to feel this way! but i'm not happy.&nbsp;so&nbsp;i was thinking that while ignoring the pain makes it&nbsp;easier to deal with,&nbsp;it will never go away. so maybe what i need to do is find a way to ease the tension without blowing my head off, or anyone elses.&nbsp;i&nbsp;want everything to be&nbsp;normal again, or at least bearable. but there's a problem with that... i don't know if i'm ready, and i don't know how i can. </P>
<P><FONT size=4>alright God... you've gotten me this far... you've even sent me protection, and i want to thank you soooo much for telling me so through matt's mom who is absolutely wonderful. thank you for her, thank you for matt, thank you for my mom, my sister, thank you for my gramma, my grampa, the rest of my grandparents and&nbsp;the rest of my family, thank you for giving me true friends, thank you for all of the amazing people in my life who've shown me the meaning of kindness, sincerity, and love. You've given me blessings beyond my belief, and i&nbsp;know that everything will be ok now. so please, i'm giving you this.. i can't handle it, i can't do it on my own... please help me, please take this into Your hands, i need you, i want to be that lamb who lies helpless at your feet, i need you to take care of me! please, show me what to do...</FONT></P>"

WOW. i've been called a LOT of things, good & bad, but never that. it was the way he said, though, that made me melt. been chillin with matt like every night. maybe i just really enjoy his company. or maybe i don't want to go back to being alone every night. the thought of him taking me straight home after work now just... well... i don't even know how to react to that thought. damn. i even have a razor here now. and a towel hangin on his wall. i used to do this.. spend every night out. and i felt like shit. it's different with him though... he always takes me home b4 i sleep. i guess that's part of the difference. AND i know i'm cared for... i'm pretty sure a lot. 

and i just fell off his chair. LOL"

<P>i know i'm a dork but it's been goin through my head soooo much! i love happy catchy fun songs!<FONT size=5> ""let me hear you say this shit is bananas! B A N A N A S!!!"" </FONT><FONT size=6><STRONG>WOOOOOO!!!!! </STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3>that's just fun. </FONT></P>
<P>ANYWAY.... yeah. i was just chillin outside shmokin the day's last cigarette, thinkin about some funny stuff.. like thursday i think it was? man i wanna type about this b/c it's sooooooo funny but i don't kno if i should. well, let's just say it involved adrianna's house being <STRONG><EM>REEEEAAALLLLLYYYY hot</EM></STRONG> and we couldn't stand the heat, especially not her. she had just gotten outa the shower and was blow-drying her hair downstairs.. it wasn't her birthday but welllll...&nbsp;&nbsp;she had the suit on. NOBODY was home and we were expecting our lil emils to show up. i was crazily hot so i decided to put the top 1/2 of the suit on&nbsp;as well back when age was still in the shower.&nbsp;and then i&nbsp;was in the kitchen while she was in the living room at the time.</P>
<P>then the doorbell started going <FONT size=6><STRONG>dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong!!! </STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3>age yelled for me to get it cuz of course emily was supposed to be there, so i started walking around the corner.... OMG, it wasn't emily! it was <STRONG><EM>M</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3><STRONG><EM>r. Creme</EM></STRONG>&nbsp;himself, lookin in the window! i was like ""O SHIT!"" then grabbed my shirt and ran into her brother's room next to the kitchen. apparently age didn't realize why i ran b/c <EM>she</EM> actually went to the door. i heard her yellin or somethin, i don't remember, but the next thing i heard was <FONT size=6>""Yous guys are naked</FONT>. why'r you naked adrianna?"" or something like that. i guess she tried to explain that it was too hot to be clothed upstairs doing her hair. by then i had come out to see him taking off his shoes on the steps like he always does.. he looked at me and goes, <STRONG><FONT size=5>""you were naked too.""</FONT></STRONG> omg i love him, he's so funny. i felt like i should have just said, 'yes mr. cremo."" but i didn't, i tried to explain that there was nobody home and it was too hot. but ho ly shit&nbsp;did&nbsp;we&nbsp;ever&nbsp;laugh our asses off about that one!. </FONT></P>
<P>later we found out that ""Daddy"" thought we were doing <STRONG><EM><FONT size=7>""lesbian things""...</FONT></EM></STRONG> omg i seriously died all over again... and again.. and again now... he's so funny, if he only knew how much i adore him. he suspects age of other things sometimes. like when she tells me he goes, <STRONG><EM>""you gettin drunk adrianna?""&nbsp;</EM></STRONG>just&nbsp;imagining&nbsp;his accent and the tone in his voice makes me smile. i love it!&nbsp;but he does know&nbsp;what a good daughter she is, and how kind-hearted she is. him and i were just discussing that today, actually. i love talking adrianna up, especially to Mr. Cremo.. b/c then i get to see him smile and hear him agree. it's great!</P>
<P>lesbian things.. WOW. that's amazingly hilarious. o Daddy, if you only knew.... LOL &nbsp;;-P</P>"

"event","Hey, push comes to shove, today sucked ass. If anybody reads my stupid thoughts on the internet. Maybe u actually wonder what goes on with me, maybe u care, hell maybe u dont. It doesnt matter. A person made me relize what a bad person i am. FUCK! It was already a bad day and sumone happens to be on the computer giving me hell and laughing at me because of sumthing that really hurt me. He thought it was funny to see me  hurt. O well alot of people seem to think that way. Went to see Bobby today. He looked awful! rachel and i couldnt stay in there long it was hard to look at him. He broke both legs, and his left leg might not be able to work right agian, he broke his right arm and hand, and he broke his pelvic bone. He is put on a breathing machine. He was to go threw surgery every 3 days to try to get all the broken bones fixed. We had to wait for about 3 hours just to see him. well i better go. ill right to u guyz later!

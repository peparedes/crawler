"event","Currently on Day 16 of the Bikram 30 Day challenge, and I&#39;m 2 classes ahead, 12 more to finishing the challenge. 

Compared to my very first Bikram class, I can truly tell that my fitness has improved leaps and bounds. There are so many indications of that - my heart rate doesn&#39;t pound as hard anymore, I don&#39;t feel giddy or want to pass out, I can hold all the poses perfectly even for Kathip&#39;s standard, and best of all, I no longer have the phobia of Triangle Pose. 

All of it thrills me. I am fitter. I am leaner. My arms are smaller. I am stronger. I have the inner strength and determination to survive anything, simply because I want to change my life. 

Looking forward to the end of the challenge though - so I can get back to my Vinyasa and Flow classes!&nbsp;"

"event","Planning my Yoga schedule for the week has got to be one of the things I look forward to every week. So I have 10 classes with Yoga Movement, and they have 6 different types of classes, 5 if I exclude Yoga Zen. While I do not prefer their lousy slippery mats, their small toilet and policy of charging for water and towels, I do enjoy being in a place where I do not know anyone, experiencing new instructors and cultures. I found ways to get around the small toilet, by heading straight home after the class. I want to go to the different studios to see if they have different towel colors.

My yoga foundation is strong enough to allow me to go to different studios, and know that I will be able to keep up. I really enjoy that. It makes me confident. Sometimes I&#39;m amazed how strong I&#39;ve gotten, and it excites me that I still have so far more to go. It&#39;s a never-ending journey!&nbsp;"

I did manage to see the flamingos (only because our meeting room was right outside the Flamingo Lake) and the&nbsp;penguins.&nbsp;<br /><br />The penguins enclosure was absolutely <i>awful</i>. Picture numerous penguins littered around a room the size of a classroom, with mirrors all around to simulate a larger environment. The pool they had was about 1m in depth. I saw a King Penguin, just staring into space. In fact, I didn&#39;t even see any activity in the enclosure. Compared to their natural habitat, I would be depressed in the tiny space too.&nbsp;<br /><br />But it does bring to mind one question. How are we different from them in our HBD flats anyway."

We need moral values, such as respect, responsibility, care and appreciation towards others to guide each of us to be a socially responsible person.<br /><br />&quot;We need values of citizenship. As a young nation with a short history of independence, we must have informed, rugged and resilient citizens who can stay united to overcome crisis and adversities which we must expect to happen from time to time.&quot;<br /><br />He said the ministry will do this in three broad areas.<br /><br />One way is to introduce a new Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) module by 2013 which will focus on values and character development.<br /><br />The new CCE curriculum will bring together Civics and Moral Education, National Education, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) among others.<br /><br />The CCE is expected to be infused into lessons, such as Mother Tongue and literature.<br /><br />And to place greater emphasis on holistic and balanced participation in CCA rather than just achievement, the ministry will also review LEAPS (Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service), a grading scheme for CCA.<br /><br />In addition, Mr Heng said the ministry will review the School Excellence Model and Masterplan of Awards, which were introduced in 1998.<br /><br />This is to realign them to be more student-centric while reducing the amount of administrative work needed.<br /><br />Mr Heng also emphasised the importance of engaging parents and the community to achieve these outcomes.<br /><br />- CNA/fa</span></span><br /><br />http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1154788/1/.html<br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For an entire country focused on results and excellence ever since its inception, trying to change the standard by which to grade students is but an uphill task, if I may undertake such a massive understatement. Even in the workplace now, for all the emphasis employers place on leadership positions and active involvement in activities, your GPA is but the first criteria they look at.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, focus on getting the As, before you plunge yourself into the <i>holistic and balanced participation in CCAs.&nbsp;</i><br /><br />"

"event","Playing slow songs and studying makes me think of the trip I took to Merida during my exchange.&nbsp;

We went to this town very rich in history- the streets were all one way and cobblestoned, the buildings on the streets were one to three storeys high, and square, with flat roofs. So corners were extremely sharp and pathways were extremely narrow. During the day the streets were extremely crowded. Yet at night the streets became empty, I wonder where all the people went.&nbsp;

Every trip I took, I remembered vividly at least one particular moment of it. Listening to my friends on exchange now, I can relate to them, but now I feel helpless. I just wish they&#39;ll all feel better soon.&nbsp;"

Perhaps it is time now to start thinking about what to do.. nao that I&#39;ve achieved my short term goal of perming and dyeing black my hair. So not used to it though. Next up is to get office wardrobe.&nbsp;"

And I can say I learnt so much more in this past year than I ever did in my entire life.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/184696_10150141994030189_525045188_8492938_4482975_n.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 350px; "" /><br /><br />Well firstly, I underestimated the effect that going on exchange will have on me. I thought my homesickness would be balanced out by all the fun and excitment of making new friends. And not only did I get into trouble, I also made my first 2 enemies that I would forever remember for the rest of my life because of the tar they made. Hopefully in time I would let it go. &nbsp;<br /><br />I wish that for every day I spent crying in Mexico, I would make it up with a day of happiness.&nbsp;<br /><br />The independence I&#39;ve gained, in my emotional state, and street-wiseness, I would never have learnt them if I haven&#39;t gone away. I&#39;d never learnt to appreciate my family otherwise. Never learnt to cook, to wash, to take care of myself, to be wiser and smarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />And may I lead a life of no regrets, become wiser in my dealings with people, and learn to read them better.&nbsp;"

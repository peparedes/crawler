dun nuh duh nuh
woke up one mornin
dun nuh duh nuh
stumbled out my bed
dun nuh duh nuh
went to the WC
dun nuh duh nuh
fire engines are red
dun nuh duh nuh

A war began
dun nuh duh nuh
and it was fun
dun nuh duh nuh
when i shot jeanna
dun nuh duh nuh
with a rubber dart gun
dun nuh duh nuh

but jeanna rallied
dun nuh duh nuh
and called her ally
dun nuh duh nuh
and the wicked brandi
dun nuh duh nuh
shot me in the eye
dun nuh duh nuh

my compatriot cody
dun nuh duh nuh
aided me for a while
dun nuh duh nuh
but then he was laid low
dun nuh duh nuh
by our foes so vile
dun nuh duh nuh

I got some boxes
dun nuh duh nuh
and made me a fort
dun nuh duh nuh
it walls were high
dun nuh duh nuh
nothin good rhymes with fort
dun nuh duh nuh

they assaulted it's towers
dun nuh duh nuh
and its walls so high
dun nuh duh nuh
but i was safe within
dun nuh duh nuh
and i passed the time by
dun nuh duh nuh

then the evil Laura
dun nuh duh nuh
with a foam disk gun
dun nuh duh nuh
tore down the south wall
dun nuh duh nuh
and i had to run
dun nuh duh nuh

they chased me far
dun nuh duh nuh
they chased me long
dun nuh duh nuh
then i made Desk fort
dun nuh duh nuh
it was very strong
dun nuh duh nuh

But the cruel Brandi
dun nuh duh nuh
outmanuevered me
dun nuh duh nuh
she snuck from the side
dun nuh duh nuh
and shot my wee-wee
dun nuh duh nuh

Fort #2 was abandoned
dun nuh duh nuh
i had to retreat
dun nuh duh nuh
little did i know
dun nuh duh nuh
there was no hiding for me
dun nuh duh nuh

as i returned
dun nuh duh nuh
to the WC
dun nuh duh nuh
i saw those wicked harpies
dun nuh duh nuh
laid a trap for me
dun nuh duh nuh

a chair prevented
dun nuh duh nuh
my escape
dun nuh duh nuh
i was shot 45 times
dun nuh duh nuh
shot in the face
dun nuh duh nuh

The wicked Jeanna
dun nuh duh nuh
The cruel Brandi
dun nuh duh nuh
and the evil Laura
dun nuh duh nuh
put and end to me
dun nuh duh nuh

my defeat was mournful
dun nuh duh nuh
my fight was too
dun nuh duh nuh
so i sits by the dumpster
dun nuh duh nuh
and i sings the blues
dun nuh duh nuh
dun nuh duh nuh"

I was treated as a potential terrorist
I heard a black man say ""South CRUNKolina""
I ate at a Ghetto Subway
I ate at a Ghetto Chinese resteraunt
I discovered Beth and I will be wed
I heard a child say he couldn't go back to his hotel room because ""mommy and daddy told him to take a long walk""
I saw tanks
I ate 16 Dunkin Donuts
My hotel room was haunted by a ghost whose greatest ability was to turn the water on and off
I got a ""thieving bag"" and confiscated 32 muffins

Other than SC, the following things have happened in KY:
Moved up a level in Shaolin-do
Caught a bunch of shrews and mice
Was attacked by a chipmunk
Discovered a real life ""evil laboratory"" at PC

That's about it

What shall Matt Smith think on? Allow me to enlighten you......
Matt Smith will be doing ecological field research. He will trap small mammals and study their little craniums and karyotype their tiny chromosomes. It pays so well that I actually feel guilty for accepting the money. I will be baked in the sun, stung by insects, feasted upon by parasites, and bitten by venomous shrews. I shall spend my days with the infamous Dr. Whittaker and various females also interested in saving the world.
There is a lady also.....the possibility intrigues me.....
Today I was assembling an electronic device when a screw fell out. I could only think to myself....""the world is an imperfect place"". Tell me, my little love-dolls the source of this quotation..not only the movie,....but the character's name and I shall ""love you up"". Now tell me THAT one also.
I'm also curious of something,...tell me, my friends....""What does Marcellus Wallace look like? Does he look like a bitch?"". now tell me THAT one. And one final quote...""that dont sound like no golden marmot i eva hoids"". The first one to tell me the movie/show and character associated with all of these quotes.....I will DO you...
Fail to do this...""and I will fight you... that's no lie""

Mego wanted a duck for a pet, so dad bought her two of them. They are quite tiny and all fuzzy-yellow. I must be vigilant to keep them safe from Pippin, as he would consume them in the same manner I would consume marshmallow peeps. I love baby ducks. That's right, I said it. Does this make me less manly? I dare say not. For when I am 45 years old, if I cannot enjoy playing with baby ducks, then I have a very severe problem indeed.

If I had a pet orangutan, I would take it to class with me and have it dress to match me. If I had a bandicoot, or perhaps a coatimundi, I would train it to be a killer and unleash it when an enemy approached.

Molly is laughing still

The salty wind beat violently at the sails, propelling our antagonists onward across the stormy seas. Water poured into the eyes (and indeed all other bodily openings) of Cannon Sam, as the raging storm showed no mercy for the vessel's captain. ""Molly,"" he shouted, ""Bring me raincoat!""
""You're already wearing your raincoat!""
""Bring me another damn raincoat!""
""I dont know where you keep your other raincoat!""
""It's in me chest at the foot o me bunk. It's right under me treasure maps and Playboys.""
""Get your own bloody raincoat! I'm not touching your used pornos.""
""I'm the captain, curse yer bones! Now do as I say!""
Molly raised her flintlock pistol and blew a hole through Sam's face.......

Wait...no...that's not what happened. Let me continue..
Molly drew close to Sam and shouted in his ear (not because he lacked any auditory perception ability, but because of the fury of the storm). ""Sam,"" she said, ""I've been thinking, you owe me.""
""What do I owe you for?""
""Well, do ye recall last summer when we were in the West Indies and we were crossin that stream up to BloodyHook cave?""
""Aye, I member that""
""And do you also recall that your glass eye fell out into the water and landed in mud and you were too concerned about the microbes growin on it to put it back in?""
""Aye...vaguely""
""And then you started bitchin bout havin to go back into town without yer eye and how the ladies wouldn't get close enough for you to rape and blah blah, so on, so forth..??""
""What's yer point Molly?""
""As you recall, I let you borrow mine so you wouldn't have to feel so bad.""
""Ah yes, and might kindly it were of ye""

School starts back in no less than two days. I'm looking forward to it. Four and a half weeks of sitting at the house are taking their toll on my sanity. I shall be carrying the heaviest load I've yet had to bear this semester. And I, sick as I am, can't wait.
HOWEVER, I do not mean to give the impression that the break was bad. It was not. And I do want to give the impression that it has been nothing but non-stop stupefying boredom. There is one bright shining star in this dismal four week night. Her name is Ashley Rose. Ashley Rose is my girlfriend now, about which I am very happy indeed. Ashley is kind and sweet, funny and fun. She is easily the most beautiful being currently living (inside and out) in this world. It is my most sincere wish that I am somehow able to do everything right for her and that she be as happy to be with me as I am with her.
Everyone, I wish you a happy day. Farewell for now."

"event","Hello friends,
 It has been months since I last updated the livejournal. I was reading some of my friends' the other day and decided it was high time I updated mine. SO, here it is.
  I now work in the Pikeville College library tutoring. The pay is decent and it gives me something to do in addition to the extra money. School is going just dandy this semester. There is one class I'm struggling in a little, but my grade is perfectly salvageable and I feel like I can do it. There is no current love interest, but there was not long ago. It didn't go bad by any means, and nothing particularly traumatic or sad happened, just didn't work out. C'est la vie.
  I've been sick for a while now. The flu is a harsh mistress indeed. Two old girlfriends approached me with confessions of love. (this was awkward) One old girlfriend publicly stated that she regretted dating me (I never thought I was that bad of a guy, and i dont regret dating Her, but...eh, what can you do?). I spend alot of time with my friends now (like when we drove around Pikeville shooting at people out the window with cap-guns. hahaha. it was a lot of fun, but we feared getting arrested as several people got frightened and angry. hahahaha) I am at the college the vast majority of the time. I did several reenactments this year (including one where I was hit in the head with a saber by a screaming inbreeder (what we call southerners)). School is very enjoyable. I mostly get A's and B's, work in the library, hang out with my friends, and write notes to my Brandi which we pass between classes. I have to do some big huge music project this month that involves me playing the bagpipes (which is a good way to get a grade in my thinking).
 I have new friend who is sweet, beautiful, and funny. I dont see her very much but I send her icq messages from my work all the time. Her name is Ashley Rose (i told you i would mention you!)Plus, she really helped me out with one particular thing, which has endeared her to me beyond words. Ashley Rose is great.
 I cant really think of anything else that is interesting enough to write about that wouldn't require me typing for thirty minutes (you guys know how i am at telling stories), and i'm supposed to be working right now so I will take my leave of you all. Much love to those who love me."

Well, school is going great. WHO HAS A 4.0?? RIGHT HERE!!! Genetics is difficult. Chemistry can be. Evolution is fun (hear that Jasmine Bailey? it's FUN. evolution is our friend--says Matt as he burns a calf to a statue of Darwin. Work is nearly done for the year. Yes, fishtrap will have to find a way to do without me. It just makes me sad that they are throwing the party AFTER I leave instead of on my last day. And i'm not invited (hands head and cries silently)
Here are some messages to some special kids (i dont mean that in a short-bus fingerpainting kind of way)
Jordo- screw that website. I AM THE PORN BARON!!!!
Beth- today is the day my evil plans will transpire.you will have your swag m'lady (bows)
Jazz- you are my best icq friend UNTIL THE DAY THAT I DIE. oh yes, katie is cool too
Amber- we're some bitchy people, but not so bad. WHAT ARE THOSE HOLES IN THE LIGHTS FOR? (movie theatre)
Brandi- what can i say? i love you. (and your cookies)
Courtney Bevins- you make comments on my livejournals. you are forever my most worthy opponent in battle.for this, i love you (bows)
Brandi again- more cookies on wednesday? (teary eyes).love.....so...so....much. Your next note will contain a graphical representation
Kayleigh- you make comments as well, smooches for you
 Well guys, I will write more after my evil designs are complete. Pray that the police and the gods will all be looking a different way. hahaha"

When I got there I joined up with some Wildlife Biologists who were there to determine how lethal the black grimey waters of fishtrap really are. This is what we did, no joke. We waded out into the water, stuck metal rods with wires attched down in the water, and electrocuted the fish. Yes,...we shocked them. Then, when the ""addled"" creatures floated to the top, I scooped them up into a net and put them in a bucket. hahahaha. I wish I weren't serious. Then we dissected them on the bank and put various organs into testtubes for even bigger geeks to study in a lab. BY THE WAY, When water is full of electric current....it's a bad idea to touch it with your skin.. (Matt recalls then pain he suffered)...a Very bad idea.

Then, i took my pre-test formy yellow belt at shaolin-do class. I GOT A PERFECT SCORE!! HELL YES!!
Then, when i got back to jordo's house, beth fixed a cake. It was chocolate with chocolate icing and chocolate pudding inside! I.....tears streamed down my face. That's all I can say about it.She's too good to me. Until she gives me diabetes........

Then, when i woke up this morning Beth was standing over top of me stuffing bras and pajamas into a bag. hahaha. Then I couldn't shower because jordo's water was shut off by some water company assholes. I went to work stinky. :-(
But before I left Jordo gave me some hetero man lovin and everything was okay. (big grin and thumbs up)

   Wow....i never thought my throat could be almost completely closed off and i could still enjoy some delicious cheesesticks. There is a show on t.v. about centaurs, dragons, virgins, and other mythological beasts. I am listening to music that makes my toes tap.

"event","Well, I shall now describe my life starting yesterday morning and continuing until now.
Yesterday I woke late and killed time until I went to my friend Jordo's house. There we listened to jewish music and watched Rammstein videos. Yes, that's what I said.Later that evening at shaolin-do class, Jordo sat out on the sidelines because he was ill and I kicked the ass of his sister beth.
I am a mean fiesty kung-fu fighter. Then we changed our clothing and watched The Village at the theatre. NEVER EVER WATCH THE VILLAGE!! SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING WORTHWHILE!!
Seriously folks, I would look at Jordan and we would shake our heads. I would look at Beth, and we would shake our heads. That is a horrible horrible terrible ending for a movie. It was so bad, I actually became angry.


 Today. Today I woke early at Jordo's house and departed for work. One of my tasks today was to empty the garbage can at Lick Creek Boat Ramp. (this also entails picking up garbage from the ground around the can.......I know.......I hate my life.) Anyway, I bend over to pick up two particular pieces of garbage. But these are not just any pieces of garbage....oh no.
The first one........a used condom. I grimace. But the second piece of garbage.....ooohhhh that second piece of garbage.... right next to the used condom lay......a bloody tampon. I kid you not. I actually laughed out loud. hahaha. Some guy launching his boat thought I was insane. I left them there on the ground.
Later in the day we check to make sure that all the boaters in the lot actually paid their launch fees. In the ENTIRE lot only one man did not pay........Jesus. That's right, Jesus did not pay to launch his pontoon. haha. it was a blue truck that said JESUS really huge across the windshield. Then when we tried to call his plates in to the system, they cant find him. they try four times....maybe it really WAS Jesus.
But then again, if it were the REAL Jesus he probably would have been honest enough not to try to stick it to the man. Wouldn't he?"

"event","Ello friends. Yesterday was a very horrible and sucktastic day at work so I shall not discuss it. After work I picked up my friend Beth. She made both cookies and brownies for me. She is too good to me. I love her. The we went to Shaolin-do and learned to kick manys the ass. Afterwards,on the car ride, I informed her that it would be foolish to ever love someone or get romantically involved with the opposite sex. Like Jesus said, the will only kick you in the balls and laugh while you cry.Then, we got a movie and went to Jordo's house where I stayed for the remainder of the night safely within the sweet embrace of love. Actually I slept in the room with Jordan and talked about Judaism until I fell asleep.hahaha. But the love thing would have been cooler.
Today... I did not get to have lunch with my friend Brandi for she had visiting relatives. I stayed at Jordo's house and harassed Lihi on the phone about purchasing her little sister and hitting on her mother. haha. Then I came home to shower and watch Starsky and Hutch. DO IT.tee hee. tickles me.
I talked to my old friend Constance on the phone for a little while. It's good to re-acquaint with old friends. We talked about the Bible, sideburns, ducks, college, and cardboard cut-outs of Elvis. Cardboard cut-outs of Elvis.....what the hell is wrong with the world? hahaha.
Eh, that's enough rambling for tonight. I send you love my little bon-bons. Farewell"

"event","Good day. I probably wont type in this thing for a few days, so I thought I would ramble a little now.
I hate getting up early for work.Morning comes entirely too early in the day. If there were any justice in the world my employers would all come down with dysentery.
As most of you (my friends) know, I've went through some proverbial ""shit"" lately. A man I know whom I have always considered to be very wise said this about pain..""People say that times heals all wounds. Well it doesn't. Time does heal anything. Scars that people put on your heart stay there.You carry them your entire life, youjust grow stronger and learn to live with them."" That seemed true to me and I took comfort from it. Then last night I was talking to Brandi about the same thing. She disagreed with this man and told me that the scars do in fact heal. This is also comforting news.Brandi is a good person and an extremely intelligent girl. I'm going to trust her on this one. I see evidence of what she said already.Thanks Brandi.
A letter from my college told me i'm getting a SHITLOAD more scholarship this year and that my tuition is covered. This makes me want to dance a hearty jig. But at the same time I don't trust my college and I'm afraid that for some reason they may decide to take the money back. Greedy bastards.
The Shaolin-do classes are coming along nicely.I'm learning a lot and I can kick many people's asses.I'm thinking I will use all the money I'm making at the dam to perhaps buy a new car,.......or spend it on hookers. Either way, it's a wise investment.
Well, I suppose that's enough rambling for today. I will get ready for work and go slave away at the fishtrap. farewell my friends, you shall hear from me again."

"event","Today was a horrible day....a horrible..terrible day. The Corps of Engineers deemed it wise to punish me for various offences. Why couldn't they send me to jail? Or fine me? Or execute me?No,....they are too cruel for that. Far too cruel.
What was my punishment you may ask? Well, I shall tell you. I had to go to Wal-Mart...dressed......as Safety Squirrel. That's right. I dressed up in a costume of a Six and a half foot squirrel wearing a hard hat and goofy-ass tennis shoes. For two hours of my life I had to wave at middle-aged women and hug small children. (all the while silently cursing them from beneath my massive squirrel noggin)Some days life just sucks. 
The rest of my work day was spent patrolling the dam and eating chinese food. The chinese food part made my heart smile a little, but it will take much more to erase the stain that Safety Squirrel has put on my soul.
One good thing did happen today. I was informed that some worthless holler-skank stoner kid broke the law and has to do community service AT THE DAM. And yours truly gets to give him work. (evil smile) Finally, all those dirty and menial tasks that I have had to do can be pushed off onto some random law-breaker. He gets to repay his debt to society and I get to sit back and do easy jobs. I cna feel myself getting fatter already. 
Until tomorrow my adoring fans, Adieu."

Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I have decided that I will make a live journal. I will likely lose interest with it in a few days, but until then I shall bask in the sunlight of livejournal.
My day was annoying. First I had to go help settle some domestic disputes at the dam before some innocent boater was executed. Then I had to take a captured pupdog to the animal shelter, where it shall be executed. (But it's okay,they do it humanely, because they are the Humane Society). Then I ate some soup and a hot apple pie. After that I labored out in the sun like a common fieldhand. My day sucked the proverbial ""ass"".
But then I came home and decided to keep a live journal so that all of the world can know how intriguing and very very sexy my life really is. Okay, so I lied. Everyone can read my live journal and then realize how much more they appreciate their lives for not sucking as much as mine does. 
But school starts soon and my journey to becoming a doctor shall be closer to fulfilment. Then I jump in my super-fast car lots of large breasted women have relations with me. tee hee hee. So I lied again.......who cares.... your life is no better. YOU DONT KNOW ME!!!STOP JUDGING!
That is all I shall type for today my little honey-drenched apricots. Soon I will write more for you.Until then, remember these words of wisdom     ""dont fry bacon naked."""

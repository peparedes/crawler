"event","........ Wow.. It has been along time since I have updated my livejournal. So muh has changed I dont even know where to start.  First off my Step mom moved out. So its just me and my dad living at home.  Life still sucks. I try to stay home as little as possible.  as of right now i am homeless.  My dad couldnt afford our Trailor since Becky has been gone so he is selling everything.  Im not sure where im going to go yet.  Me and Charles are still hanging out like everyday.  Lately I've been really depressed.  Im not sure why I just for some reason absolutly HATE my Dad.  Hes the reason im not in school anymore hes the reason im not with who I want to be with. Hes just caused alot of things to go wrong in my pathatic life.  Im trying so hard to do right but its like anything i do isnt good enough.  But.... There is one awesome thing!!!!!!!!!!!!
                       NOVEMBER 15 I GO TO PROGECT RIGHT TURN!!! WHICH MEANS MY PROBATION OFFICER WILL CLOSE MY CASE SHORTLY AFTER THAT!!!!!!!!!!! YAY!!!   I'LL BE FREE!!!! I CANT WAIT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY FOR SO LONG!!! 


I will be able to leave from home without anyone saying anything or anyone calling the cops! I will be so happy!\



OMG I called Morgan today I couldnt belive I actually called her and talked to her. The conversation went well I just asked her how she was doing and so forth.  I wanted to go see her before work but i didnt want to push it.  I wasnt sure if she would have wanted to see me or not. Becasue she didnt seem as excited to talk to me as i was.  

Friday I went to the fair. It was alot of fun I was only there for an hour we left and bought a quarter bag.  I got to smoke outta my new Pipe hahaha.... Well I got to go to damn work. 


I might update soon im not sure what will happen lol"

"event","Well My thanksgiving sucked ass.. It was totally bogus. Me and my brother got in a HUGE fight. I didnt get to spend it with who i wanted to. And my retarded moms side of the family which are Christain freaks kept asking me things about where i was when i ran away and crap it got real gay. I got pissed at my aunt and walked out. Im still at my grandmas. Im just sitting here writeing this journal entry and whatnot. its pretty gay. I miss.. My room. even though i hate being at my house. I was thinking maybe when my dad goes to like work on the road i could live with my grandma and get her to finish the room in the garage that would be totally awesome. I would have my stereo Blarring... It would be good stuff. i would have a blast with my guitar out there. The only thing is she lives in the country kinda and thee are feild mice that get in there. So I  would like have mouse trapps EVERYWHERE i hate mice.. 

But anyways.. Im stuffed i ate so much today. And i got to see my neatto cousins which made me happy. Well.. im going to go LaTeR!

"event","So... i was talking to one of my friends named lendsey after i read that journal and those comments from morgan this is what she had to say....VoLcOmStOnEs557: me and morgan are fighting
bAbeOnthEbEAch06: when r u comin back over
VoLcOmStOnEs557: dk
bAbeOnthEbEAch06: y?
VoLcOmStOnEs557: because i'll show you
VoLcOmStOnEs557: hold on
bAbeOnthEbEAch06: ok    
VoLcOmStOnEs557: Morgan wrote this fucked up journal entry ......................................................................................sighs ....i really really hate it when...things are going real good between us, but then i read the things you say, & it makes me want to scream in your face! it makes me want to slap some sense into you! it makes me not want to be your best friend anymore!
but then you call, or i see you at school, & i'm so happy to see you that i forget everything i was mad at you for, & i want things to be like they used to be. before people started to get in the way. before drugs got in the way. before sex got in the way. before your so called ""love"" got in the way....& before you fucking ran away. 
you really have no idea how fucked up things are now, & no matter how many times you say you're sorry, no matter how hard you cry, no matter how ""broken"" your heart is, & no matter how hard you wish you could see him again....what you want doesn't really matter any more, you already ruined that choice. what's important is what you need, & what you need is some serious help. & a serious slap in the face to bring you back to reality. 
bAbeOnthEbEAch06: oh man
bAbeOnthEbEAch06: makes me wanna help you beat her upVoLcOmStOnEs557: isnt that fucked up
VoLcOmStOnEs557: lol
bAbeOnthEbEAch06: but i know you could do it yourself
VoLcOmStOnEs557: wanna read the comment i wrote her back
bAbeOnthEbEAch06: yea
VoLcOmStOnEs557: Ok.. Morgan Im starting to wonder if your not the screwed up one. First off you say you hate it when things are going good between us i thought we got everything straightend out im not even going to try anymore and im dead serious this time!u also said drugs are getting in the way sorry but i havent done anything your the one taking persciption pills for someones broken arm and thinking its all funny. Its not. Im tired of trying to make everything better and then you start with your smart ass comments.. Maybe we werent met to be friends. Theres so many people that agree with me they first thought you know you had a right to be pisssed and all.. Then i was like ok i know i fucked up and all so i will just give her some time and space. But you know now i have told these ppl the shit your saying to me and there like man she must not be a true friend because if she was she would support you thourgh whatever goes down. And im finnaly getting smarter and relizeing its not worth trying to fix things between us anymore That day I saw you at the school I shouldnthave even talked to you! Because deep down i knew it would only happen again. Please just stay outta my life. And leave me alone.. I have so much going on i dont need your shit to worry about as well... So just fucking forget everything i have ever said to you. About missing you and loveing you and things i have said about us being friends forever because you are fucked up and i never wanna talk to you again im serious about this too I hope your comfortable with talking to Jason about everything because im not going to be here to talk to you anymore im done with you. And that is final and im not going back on my word anymore!


Have a nice fucking day,
Brittney

"event","So.. Today was better than yesterday. Im STILL at my grandmas house Im kinda ready to go home. But I guess its better than being at home because of me and my dads fighting. I wish we could get along like normal people. Like other father and daughters.. I know i act like i totally hate him but i really dont. i just dislike him at timesnd i get all pissed at him because he wont let me be with david. Everything has been differrent sence i ranaway though its actually gotten worse ecspecailly with becky my step mom she acts like she dont even want me in her house. But its alright though....

Anyways.. Today me and Keyton talked all class period in last block it was awesome! It started out he was just asking me some questions about why i ran away and how was it like in ""jail"" then i ended up telling him the whole story and all.. and he was like Brittney you really love him dont you I was like with all my heart. and he was like man I know exactly how you feel and he told me some stuff. It was amazing hearing him talk about his life i never knew he had a heart that big. He really did understnad where i was coming from. although he didnt like the fact that i got into as much trouble as i did. He just made me promise not to ever try any hardcore drugs and he made me promise never to give up. He said some other stuff that really touched me too.. I was relived that i finally found someone i can talk to and trust i feel comfortable around him who knew that two totally diff. ppl could like be on the same level ... well that was good stuff..


My grandmas foster kid had lice so i had to treat her head YUCK.. When i was combing it a HUGE!! Bug came out i mean it was soo big. people say they are ushually small and you can hardly see them wow that baby was big. it was soo gross but i did it anyways to help my grandma out. you know shes really not that bad. Shes actually pretty cool I have been spending alot of time with her sence i have been on house arrest seeing that i hate being home and here is the only other place i can go to besides my moms on sundays. Well im going to go I need a cigerette.. So Ill update later

Me and him remind me of me and Morgan always doing stupid things lol.. Like one time me and Dave went to a chinese restrunt lol and like they had a sushi bar so me and dave both ate this sushi with like an octopusis tenticle wrapped around it And i threw up all over the place.. It was soooo chewy and sooo salty it was discusting YUCK! It was so gross. I ran to the bathroom and threw up all over the sink nd mirror. lol yucky but it was funny then i went in the parking lot still puckin my brains out and dave was on the ground laughing so i turned to see what he was laughing at and everyone was walking out of the restruant HAHAHAHA Funny times.... Oh man I cant stop laughing now.. 

Then one time we went to the beach when it was freezing cold and when ppl were walking by on the beach we would start yelling stupid crap like oh my god i lost my dog.. And asking them if they stole it.. Or we would say like i lost my chalupa i know you stole it i saw you. It was funny then dave would party boy ppl.. Hes great fun i love that kid with my whole heart.... 


Well.. Anyways... I saw morgan today im beginning to get more comfortable around her again which is great i hope  nothing goes wrong with us again i really did miss her even though i acted like i didnt. But im going to go LaTeR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I guess my two days outta ISS was ok. I talked to everyone and all. The thing thats making me mad is theres three guys that wanna date me now and im thinking its just because they have heard im not a virgin anymore. But I dont know. Im not going to date any of them because i know who I wanna be with and thats all there is to it. Even though some PEOPLE (COUGH) Dont like who i wanna be with its all good cause i seriously could care less about them. But anyways i dont wanna get all worked up about someone that means absolutly nothing to me anymore.


Im going to  Homecoming tonight. I kinda wanna go but its going to be gay cause i know my dad is going to make me sit by him the whole time. I got some new guitar tabs. Im starting to get better at guitar because thats all i do anymore seeing that im on house arrest and all...

But i dont know i dont think anyone in this whole freaking sorry exccuss of a world will ever understand. Except jessica i really think she understands because shes going through almost the same thing.

I tried talking to Rich but he just said your gay and blocked me. I feel so abandoned.....but what ever im going to go Later......"

"event","Hey yall.. Well Im finally home I was in DJJ in Columbia for running away with David. I just went to court today and they sent me home on house arest... then after house arrest they are putting me on strict probation. The judge said I cant have any contact with dave until this is all over... that really sucks it makes me mad... I think my dad finally understands how i feel about dave and now someone else tells me i cant be with him... THIS SUCKS I wish everyone would leave me alone.... DJJ Sucks I hated it we had to wear jumpsuits like we was in jail we were locked down all of the time.. I met some pretty cool ppl there though Like this one chick named Jessica and this other girl named Leah they were awesome then I met a couple of others named Prince and Ciaria they were cool too... 


I really want to talk to Dave but I cant because I dont wanna get introuble anymore If i have any contact with him they will send me away again and ill be gone for months... I hope DAve will wait on me because no other girl would ever be in handcuffs and shackles for him I was locked up over him just so I could be with him and I know no other girl would ever do that for him. Hes my heart I love him so much I wish people could see that.... But no one seems to understand... im glad im home though... But I really really miss Dave I wish I could just hear his voice one time.. I dont know how im going to do it. I cant get over him. I love him too much everyone is telling me its not true love but i know it is i wish they could switch places with me and see how i feel about him and how bad this is hurting me my heart hurts. I feel so depressed i want to be with him. I love him sooo much.... well im going to go I love yall... And I missed yall while i was gone   x0x0

But i guess it will be alright though because like Ill get to see dave everyday and we wont have to sneak around to see each other that would be super awesome if like we date this whole year!! Im glade hes home from Flordia He went to go see Matt hoffmens Bike show thingy He said he bought me something from there.. lol It is ANOTHER glass rose thingy like he got me last time LOL But this one is bigger and is has preyin hands on it he said its better tahn the last one. Hes a nerd. But i love him... I cant belive i was even sweatin all that crap about Josh. See josh got a g/f And i was mad but i dont even know why I guess because i like him as well as dave but i know deep inside that I like Dave lots more we have been through so much together and even though i really fucked up and cheated on him 4 times hes still by my side... My friend from work Told me That guys will do anything for some pussy and a peice of ass thats why hes still arouond but i clearly stated to dave before we started dating that i am a virgin and wanted to keep it that way. But he still sometimes makes comments about us haveing sex.. that really bugs me but i dont want to tell him.maybe The guy from work was right.. I asked him if i should break up with dave and he said no Because maybe hes different from other guys. and he said i should give him a chance but just be careful... I dont think I could break up with dave even if i wanted too... I love him SOOO much I wish My dad could understand... And let me date him... I guess me and dave double O 7in our relationship makes it better because there is always something going on and it will never get boring but i still wish my dad could understand I wish someone could... But anyways...

To pick you upon our very first date
is it cool if i hold your hand?

im just scared of what you think

lets go
dont wait
this nights almost over
honest, lets make this night last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever

when you smile, i melt inside
im not worthy for a minute of your time
i really wish it was only me and you
im jealous of everybody in the room
please dont look at me with those eyes
please dont hint that you are capable of lies
i dread the thought of our very first kiss
a target that im probably gonna miss

lets go
dont wait

""I'm A Cloud""

And you will heal yourself when the rain begins to fall.
Feel the fire
Burning inside us all.
Remove me
For going in unchained.
Blow away for yourself and gather again.
And, listen to the conversations of the sea.
Inside us all
There's a quiet beach.
If we fall into ourselves we will become free.
I myself could use a little clarity.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That turn me every which way.

I am so full of you.
I am so full of me.
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That turn me every which way.

Then I opened up my mouth.
I'm a cloud.
And these words they seldom come out.
When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why
She'd want a cloud that's *fucking around.*

But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear.
And feel the fury of these tears
As they run down my face
I can feel her so far away.

'Cause I am a cloud.
And I am so afraid.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That turn me every which way.

So don't you come and gather at me in this haze.
I sit at home and feel the sun's daze.
*I should tell me not to little everyday.*
I blow away remaining unfazed.

When I feel the there's something crawling out of me
I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise.

These motherfuckers stepped on me,
Tried to fuck me from behind.

'Cause I am a cloud.
And I am so afraid.

And I... I am.
So... full of love.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That turn me every which way.

I am so full of you.
I am so full of me.
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing.

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That turn me every which way.

I am... so full of love.
Love!

I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of...

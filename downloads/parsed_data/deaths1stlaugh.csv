"event","Is going well. I still have to ship a bunch of stuff. I have a few offers on my car. I'm selling it for 1200 but I also got an offer for 1000 which I'd be ok with too.

But once that's all settled, we should be good.
I booked our tickets today. We leave December 10th at 725pm and arrive in Nevada at 856pm. Chase says the jet lag is gonna kill me. But we'll see. I'm tired 95% of the time and I make due just fine...summoning energy out of my ass somehow.

Both our rooms are packed except whats going on the plane with us.


Things are clicking. yay"

"event","is a website where you can help people who are poor and in desperate need.

It's a really neat site where you loan people money and in six months, you get it back.

They have a 98% repay on the loans and it would be a good idea to help.

You'll enjoy it and you'll feel pretty damn happy with yourself.

Seriously, don't get me ANYTHING for xmas. Loan money to people on Kiva.org instead.

I'm fucking serious. 

Then if you REALLY want to get me something on June 25th after you've been repaid by the people that you very well may have saved, fine..whatever.

But not this time of the year, dammit.

So, seriously kids...help somebody out.

"event","I have been thinking a lot lately about the mistakes and regrets I have of the past. I regret few things, really, because they make me who I am. But still there are a few things, as anyone can contest.

I regret not going to college. I'm sure if I had applied to more, I would have gotten in ...somewhere. I regret not trying in highschool, even though, with the exception of math, I know I could have done better. I regret not taking more of highschool in and building more bridges with people. 

I regret burning bridges with people. Forgetting people and forcing others to forget me. People in general scare me a lot. It's something that I hide rather well. I'm outgoing and friendly on purpose to if nothing else, fake a strength that I don't have.

I regret not seeing Stacy anymore even though she's so near. I regret shutting Jade out even though we were so close. 

These things I find it completely valid to regret if for no other reason than I don't like the part of me they created. If I had tried harder, I could have gone to a college and been that much closer to starting my life.
Stacy and I grew appart because of me. I am honestly to blame for that. Because I moved and moved so far away and hung out with people that a lot of which didnt really suit me or my tastes in people because I had no one else to hang out with. And that changed me. a lot. I'm not saying I didn't want to grow as a person, I'm just saying I wish I still had the part of me that she liked so much left but I'm not so sure if I do. I miss having someone like her.
I miss Jade in a similar respect. She made me feel bad sometimes but it was such a poor decision on my part to shut her out. I sent her a message the other day for the first time in I don't know how long because I couldn't find the nerve. I can be so pathetic. I don't expect her to reply or even if she does, I certainly don't expect forgivness for shutting her out. But regardless, she didn't deserve it and I imagine I will deserve whatever she may or may not say. 

I started thinking about all these things lately becuase I've really been concerned about my future lately. I really want to go somewhere in my life and find my real place in the world. As far as stacy and Jade are concerned, I miss them and I want them to share in my future more than anyone besides my boyfriend. I want them at my wedding. I want them to love my children. 

ok, I'm starting to sound cliche but I speak in sincerity. I miss my friends. I miss the two people in my life that were strong enough to get close enough to me and either drifted from or pushed away. 


I feel so pathetic right now."

"event","San Clemente Beach was sunny as can be Tues. through Thurs. and the water was body surfable.  Mon. night we had a short but nice visit with Dad and Dona and her daughter Tarri, Tarri's daughter-in-law Ashley and her Mom.  We had to sleep at Jackie and Jim's because there was no room at Dad's but it was cool  reminiscing about Mom with Jackie. 
Pam, Hank, Hankie, and Nicolina met us at the Quality Suites hotel in S.C. and we kicked it with them on the beach and cruised around seeing my old 
haunts in the area. It rained Wed. a.m. for about an hour and then turned into a beautiful sunny day.  John and I went home via Carlsbad area and ran into Bob O. when he stopped for lunch at the Harbor Cafe.  (Small world, eh?)"

"event","Met Robin and Norm for dinner Fri. at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and heard all about their Alaza excursion.  In spite of her MS they went kayaking and river rafting. They're now trying to talk us into a river rafting trip but it sounds like getting a few too many bruises for my tastes. Had lunch at Morongo Casino's restaurant with Aunt Prudie, Aunt Tina, cousins Sherry and Pattie, and John's Dad yesterday.  They all love to gamble but I ran over to the outlets instead (didn't have any luck there either).  Talked about a Lake Mojave boating trip with Sherry and her clan for the August 11th ish...we'll see how the heat continues to be first."

"event","Yesterday I met Nancy Edwards and Barbara Pisha down at Doheny State Beach where we had a private tour of the Oceanography studies facility.  Saw tanks of moon jelly fish, various species of fish and shark, and touched live starfish.  We had lunch at the Fisherman's wharf on the San Clemente pier (red clam chowder good but not excellent and prawn shrimp cocktail was great) then went body surfing in warm water with fun waves at Carlsbad beach. Never go on hwy. 91!! It's worth driving a bit further and go down 215 to 15 to 78 and 5."

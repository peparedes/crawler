"event","<FONT FACE=""Arial"">I really wish that I had the time for NaNoWriMo.

But I don't.

I just got very, very excited about it.

Anyhow, enjoy <LJ-CUT TEXT=""chapter one."">I am Glarjenarn, Faithful Warrior, priest of Vigtan the War-Master, son of Vigtanshoth, Man-of-Vigtan. I have written this account of this adventure for I know not if a war-poet shall ever recite it for me.
	I know many of the elf-words and almost all the dwarf-words, those scripts which speak most when fewer words are written. I have written this to the lucky treasure of a book, the importance of which you shall understand as I tell my story. That I have written in the words of elves and dwarves ensures that all who read it shall understand my meaning and know what is common to me but foreign to them.
	My king, Rechlosh, ruled well his spear-men and village-folk. His was the land of Truhr, a domain of ice and valley, of evergreen and stone. Truhr had become his in his eighteenth year, and he wore the crown of his people for forty-nine more. I served him from the moment I became a priest to Vigtan, when I was told by the highest of priests that I knew absolutely the code of the war god and had mastered both his skills of weapon and of leading men in battle. This was when I had my twenty-fourth summer, eight years after first entering the scholar-halls and war-arenas of the priestly order.
	I made then an oath to the War-Master, who is also god of dead men, to follow bravely my lord into battle and to know how to make war with honor. I promised Vigtan and my father, who had made the same oath before, and I had no hesitation.
	It was pleasing to give the war-cry of King Rechlosh, to be the one to tell his fighting men that our foe had no heart for peace and so we had a duty to cut out his heart of malice. Such was the command of Vigtan, and so was Rechlosh's order of war. Having no brotherly means to settle anger between two folk-lords, Vigtan demanded the finality of war-victory. To cut an enemy open was to silence his dissembling tongue and stop short his schemes. When fewer men lived, there would be more peace to share amongst them, and this was right. Vigtan would ensure that only the greatest and most honorable among warriors would live or die in victory.
	I saw five wars in my time of training, and I lived through each without harm greater than the smallest of cuts and bruises. I kept a silent prayer to Vigtan in my heart and a deafening curse to my enemies in my battle-howling, and so my axe cut deep over seventy men and shielded me of spear-ends and sword-edges. Yet I saw many good men die, and I mourned a few as my brothers. Some were others of Vigtan's order, against whom I had honed my axe-arm and battle-footing in daily exercise. Some wore the gold-rings of nobility and had set for me the greatest examples of soundness of leadership and honor in war-death.
	I saw yet three more wars in the seven years I served as priest to Rechlosh. I led many men to battle and saw only a handful of their honorable names cruelly cut out from the cloth of fate. I had bravery for myself and saw it well up in the spirits of my soldiers as I put myself into battle-frenzy.
	The first few of my wars were against the invaders from the south, the Erag, who saw fit to clean away our religion from the land. They came with the faith to their one god, which was most honorably sincere. They carried banners of the new faith, and sang war chants in the new tongue. Their warriors had all the fury and skill of ours. They had once been just as us, but they had no more belief in Vigtan's anger, the poetry of Juhyrkre, or the wisdom of Erwol. They fell before us, though they yet came at us again several times. I believe yet that Vigtan chose many of their dead for his army, for the War-Master accepts all who practice war with dedication and ferocity.
	I fought also the witches of the mountains, who brought death upon the people of Rechlosh's cousin, Hyglojor. Making war against their sorcery had little in common with fighting regular mortal men. They were few but strong, and their mastery of the dragon-words gave them terrible power. They controlled men's minds and put them to fight one another when they had been allies before. They created fire without spark or fuel, and they had the winds push away arrows from their flesh. They summoned to aid them a dragon with pitch-black scales and breath like powdered corpses, but with the help of many men I split its spine with my axe, which rusted where the monster's blood sprayed.
	These were the two greatest wars of my time, though no less important than the others I lent my strength to. I protected the women and children of Rechlosh's domain and his cousins' domains. I felt close to Vigtan, and made prayer that he should continue to hold me close to his great shield-arm. War-poets sometimes sang of the wars I fought in, and I was honored to hear them recite my victory over the dragon, my one great triumph in all my time of battle.
	I did not allow myself to dwell upon this honor, however, as it did no service to my highest-held god or my gold-giving king. I instead waited patiently for the next charge to battle, putting my skill in the forge to test. I crafted for myself a new axe, which I named Glarwosch, Faith-in-Blood. Having put the final blow of the hammer to the glowing iron, I cooled it in water mixed with my own blood, and I asked it to forever be my brother, to protect me so that I might try to give it the honor of being spoken of by poets.
	As is sometimes done, King Rechlosh asked me to appear before him with my Faith-in-Blood so that he could declare it a treasure of the kingdom. Those weapons which have brought much glory, peace, and gold to the land sometimes receive this honor. I did not accept his offer, though, for Glarwosch had not tasted any blood but my own. Rechlosh was sure, however, that Glarwosch would be as glorious as my last weapon, Lorhrithen, Axe-of-Strength, which had not been able to earn this honor. I denied yet my lord's request, which he accepted under condition that I forge for him a sword that he could call his own and give his blessing to. So it was that I forged Yrtruhr, Sword-of-Truhr, a blade of black iron much larger than any other broadsword I had seen, and I gave it to my lord, who was most pleased with it.
	I wish now that I had not forged Yrtruhr, for it became the downfall of my beloved king, and the reason I am now lost to the rest of the world.
	Rechlosh had two sons most worthy of his bloodline, Graflosh the eldest and Werfir the younger. Both were fine princes of Truhr, each having much of the land to their own whim, and each was a generous ring-giver and law-maker. Graflosh paraded cross much of Truhr, making himself well-liked amongst the common-man and a fine deputy of his father. Werfir had justice and loyalty in his prince-heart, yet he had fewer thoughts and desires to be amongst the field-folk, making sure their trust in him, for he would not inherit until both father and elder brother were taken into death. For his misfortune of age, however, he was not jealous. He had many good warriors and his own trade-roads over which he brought kingly treasures in exchange for sheep-cloth and bread-grain. His place as law-man and servant to Graflosh would always be there for him.
	Yet there was a third brother, Hyrthfir, and aye, he had the malice that sometimes grew in the heart of a prince-child who had no inheritance in sight. He put what riches he had to assembling a war-band of sea-thieves. They would not bear to live within the borders of Truhr, for Hyrthfir felt that his brothers' success was insult. He had always been, even with four years less than Werfir, the strongest and craftiest of the three. He made his father happy when he wrestled and bested not only warriors but animals fierce, even the mountain-bear and king-stag, whose antlered crown would gut a weaker man. Hyrthfir's strength, gigantic and unfailing, made so mirthful his father, who felt sure that his child would bring great victories to the kingdom. Yet Hyrthfir could not inherit first by rule of Erwol the Wise, Law-Maker even to the gods. So, when Hyrthfir had his fifteenth summer and the body of a man several years greater, he left Truhr to raid the sea-side villages of Erag, take the treasures of our northern cousins in the pine lands, and cut short the trading-routes of the bronzed-skinned traders from the far south.
	Rechlosh would have no more to do with Hyrthfir, who had so little honor or patience. When to my king I gave the Sword-of-Truhr, Hyrthfir had five and thirty years. I know not why the gods saw fit to give that lie-stained and dead-hearted prince twenty years past his leave from Truhr. He should have died when his ship first set away from our shores, swallowed up by the sea, which knows what is in the minds of all men who cross its waves.</LJ-CUT>"

"event","<FONT FACE=""Arial"">Wow.

I don't know how I thought I'd have time for NaNoWriMo.

I can hardly get my <I>school work</I> done in time.

Actually, I do know why I've been so pumped for NaNoWriMo and also believed that I could somehow participate in this year's challenge.

It's the first year since I heard of NaNoWriMo that I've actually remembered that it occurs every year.

I don't have time for my book.

Anyhow, I cheated and wrote part of the first chapter out of boredom/not realizing that a tidal wave of school work was headed my way.

I hate myself.</FONT>"

"event","<FONT FACE=""Arial"">Okay. Someone posted anonymously to my last post, pointing out that my story idea sounds like the Dark Elf stories by R.A. Salvatore.

I've never read them. Don't much plan on it. I completely and totally lose interest in anything involving the Drow. They bore me terribly. Elves in general annoy me, though I plan on mentioning elves in my story as elves were in Viking lore: demi-gods, hidden away from man in a realm of magic.

Now, what is it that my story shares in common with the Drizzt stories? Is it the plot? The main character? The conflict?</FONT>"

"event","<FONT FACE=""Arial"">Welcome, truly.

This journal is dedicated to distributing and discussing the work-in-progress novel, <U>Glarjenarn</U> (GLAR-yay-narn), by Chris Powell (<LJ USER=""bmw"">). It is my chosen project in the 2005 <A HREF=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">NaNoWriMo</A> (National Novel Writing Month) challenge. The goal of every person writing in NaNoWriMo is to produce a 50,000-word (or longer) novel starting November 1, with the final deadline being November 30.

Beginning November 1, I will be posting newly written material for my novel. Criticism is welcome and desired, but the chances that any of it will be heeded until I finish the book are next to zero.

Quantity trumps quality in this first effort. Always. 50,000 words is a very large number of words. I can edit the damned thing later.

In preparation to begin writing, the NaNoWriMo forums are buzzing with activity, and one exercise to help everyone think about the plots to their books is to write a jacket-cover teaser that best represents the book they really hope to end up writing. Here is my answer to that exercise:

<I><U>GLARJENARN</U>

Vigtan is a mighty god of war, and Glarjenarn, the Faithful Warrior, is among his greatest priests.

Stranded on an uncharted island with the daughter of a man he killed, Glarjenarn has demons both figurative and literal to contend with as he attempts to earn this girl's trust and keep both himself and her alive. Malicious spirits of the dead rise to take vengeance upon Glarjenarn, and the gods he has served so well appear only to condemn him. He has only a small book into which he may record his ordeal, and he pours into it his stories of battle, his struggle to survive, and his many mirths and melancholies.

Written from the perspective of this mighty and complex man of both faith and war, <U>GLARJENARN</U> is a story of survival, madness, and redemption set in a world reminscent of the Viking sagas.</I>

To my fellow NaNoWriMo writers, good luck. To my LJ Friends who are keeping up on my project, this book's probably dedicated to you.

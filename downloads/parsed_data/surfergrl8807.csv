*For him*
You run through my mind every moment of the day,
When I shut my eyes your face just won't go away.

I know that I will never have you 
and it kills me more than I will ever show,

Your girlfriend is luckier than you will ever know.

If tears were wishes,
and wishes did come true,
every tear that would fall
would be falling just 4 you!"

produced by hatred,
yielding lies,
teenage poetry,
and final good byes

the teen age prodigy,
stands behind the closed doors,
so lost in side she exists no more..

the pain broght forth she could not bare, 
one more tear she could not spare...

she use to urn to be so much the same,
for her demise its you to blame...


Falling

Im falling faster in love with you,
im terrified to say its true...

In my perfect world i see,
forever it beeing just you and me...

my heart beats for you only,
without you i feel so lonely....


Forgive me

please forgive me for what i did,
im nothing but a confused dumb kid...

For you I should clairify,
your the reason that i cry...

I love you so much and i want you to know,
that im sorry but i had to go....

Im sitting here in my bed,
thinking of things that i should have said...

Im sorry for getting mad,
but you hurt me extremely bad...

When you went with aaron every night,
I dont care (now), that wasnt right...

how can i still love you when you hurt me so bad,
We've been apart so long, 
but im still sad...

This painful feeling just wont leave me alone,
please take me back,
and let me come home....


Pain to me

my happy face fools and decieves,
my sadened heart, broken, grieves...

while my colideascope eyes hide how i feel,
you sit there acting like its no big deal...

you broke my heart and scarttered it around,
just so all the pieces will never be found...


To my savior..

to my savior,
hear my plee,
wash me clean of my sins,
and pureify me....

your the alpha and the omaga,
the beginning and end,
your the light in my life,
and your my best friend....

you are there to guide me through,
and im thankful for everything you do....



To my best friends....

If we go down,
we go down together,
best friends are friends forever....

you were there for all the bad and the good,
just like a true friend should...

you where there when i needed a shoulder to cry on,
if it were anyone else they would have been gone....

i love you like a sister to the very end,
you more than most,
your my bestest friend....

i would do anything for you,
cuz you would do the same,
if for some reason you were in trouble,
i would be glad to take the blame....




(untitled)

thine eyes are so deep,
thy smile so sweet,
thy heart so pure,
from joy i weep....

i love thee more than you will ever know,
i couldnt tell you,
how could i ever be that bold....

you are thy light in my life,
and my tru love,
you were truely sent from the god above



Death to her!


broken hearts and slit wrists
black eyes and bloody fists

A story book romance gone horrably wrong
now the lonly girl nolonger belongs

Her heart broken she screams and crys
Writing her words, her final good byes

She slits her wrists and watches the wonde bleed
Its all over she has done the deed

Her only love has broken her heart
she knew that it was gonna happen from the start

Will he miss 
Will he cry
it was his falt that she had to die!"

  I knew from the momenet I meet you
  that I would always call you my boo
  you got stuck deep in my heart
  I knew this from the very start.



2)As we lay there quiet
  I was reminded of all the reasons why I lust you
  Your smile,
  and the way it teased at me seductively
  Your laugh,
  and the way it tempted me
  Your eyes,
  and the way they seem to hypnotize me

  As we sat there silent
  I was reminded of all the reasons why I love you
  Your smile,
  and the way it brings such life into me
  Your laugh,
  and the way it makes everything okay
  Your eyes,
  and the way them seems to read my thoughts

  As we stand here now
  I am reminded of all the reasons why I hate you
  Your smile,
  and the way it confuses me
  Your laugh,
  and the way it seems to mock me
  Your eyes,
  and the way they can look into mine and not feel a thing

3)Purity once had a name,
  And beauty once had a face.
  Life once had a meaning,
  And once I was safe.
  Once there was freedom,
  And once I could laugh.
  Happiness once was alive,
  And once I had another half.
  Once I shared his love,
  Once I was by his side,
  Once I felt I fitted,
  So quickly that died.
  His grace so great,
  His beauty so vast,
  All I ever wanted,
  Was for it to last.
  Fate maybe had another plan,
  Or maybe he had another love,
  But it all fell apart,
  The hand too big for the glove.
  Now it's all died away,
  Happiness, joy, love; all memories.
  Now I walk alone in this dark, dark world,
  With no light to guide my way."

"event","I just got home from youth group and i sat down to check my email while watching tv. I was watching ""HOUSE"" and they brought to my attention a question that some if not all non-christians may ask. Dr. House was talking to another Dr. Dr. cameron and she asked him why some people pray to god since god doesnt exist. Dr. House said that they pray so that the wont get smashed by him or something along the lines of that. I kinda got angry because god DOES exist and he is working wonders every day in our lives. When you wake up in the mornings that is a meriacl because EVERY night you have a chance of not waking up the next morning. What if that did happen. Are you confident that you would be in a better place? Are you positive that you are gonna be happy and not engulfed in a firey pit for all time? Well i think that everyone should sit down and have a good heart to heart talk with god no matter who you are or if you belive in him or not. what could it hurt? If you wanna start this is how to go about it. Sit down in a quiet room and talk to god. Ask forgiveness of all your sins. Tell god what is on your mind and say taht you belong to him and you wanna live to serve him. God WILL always be there for you and he will ALWAYS listen. Then you start to read bible verses at church then on you on but start gradual it will be a big change. Then if you decide to you will get baptised to wash you sins away. Take it from me. I use to be gothic and belive NOBODY cared about me. I also thought that god NEVER existed. Then he opened my eyes and i did just what i told you to do and i feel so much better now that i know i have the gift of eternal happiness and life."

"event","Have you ever tried to be someone that you not? Have you ever tried so hard just to fit in? I know from experence...and it SUCKS! For example...yesterday i was walking down the hall and saw someone that I thought was my friend. I started to walk in his direction and he ran away. he doesnt know that I know this and I know that he wouldnt care but I heard him say ""Dude she is so fuckin weird."" You are probably wondering how this has anything to do wiht fitting in and trying way too hard well it has everything to do with that very subject let me rewinde for a moment to sunday. I went to Maui Nix and bought his friend a $26 hat. Ya,...dumb huh. You maybe wondering why I did that. Well they are the popular ones. The ones everyone wants to be or be with. Even if it was for a split second. I just want everyone to like me. I know in my heart that the only reason they take me with them places is because, I would do JUST ABOUT ANYTHING for them to treat me like they do their other friends that are girls. As of today I offically surrender my ass kissing days and show the world who I really am. Just a good christian girl that doesnt like conflict and just wants to be around her closest and best friends! I just want to let them know that im sorry for being a total spaz and for being a true bitch. If you know me then i bet that there is at least one thing that i could change. Please just let me know but im not gonna change completly"

"event","well,im gonna start from the beginning. I was 12 years old and met this wonderful guy named cameron masters. He was amazing, and extremly handsom. He is what a dream is made of. I fell in love and we were engaued in october of that year. I know it was young and stupid but i gave the best 3 years of my life to him. The 1st year was great nothing could have been better. The second we started fighting alot and it only got worse. Belive me when i say worse it got extremly bad. He hit me and ended up taking my viginity and it was not consentual. Please dont judge me by anything that is said here. I still care about him. I heard through a mutual friend that he was hurt and right at this very moment i am waiting for more information. I am very worried because i still love him and i pains me to think that he is hurt. All i really know at this moment is that it was a motocross accident. If you read this please reply and tell me if this is normal for me to still love someone that did all these horriable things to me. If you know me you know that i got through relationships really quick. He is the reason i cannot trust anyone in my life and HE is the one that causes me pain, HE is the one that still makes me cry every night of my life just because i miss those good moments in my life. I miss being able to go home and look at him and feel total bliss and happyness. I miss hugging and kissing him and feeling the same wonderful feeling everytime. I want him back just for that feeling again. I MISS HIM SO MUCH!!!!!"

You didnt like me from the first glance.

Your the most hate-filled person 
that I have ever met!

"event","Well this is my first entry so I am gonna post a poem that i wrote:


*In my life I have lost some things twice

I had forgotten how to smile
how to see a bit further beyond this misery

I had forgotten how to be happy
how to trust anyone, give them power over me

I had forgotten how to be me 
buried everything inside hidden from others

You taught me how to smile again
to laugh without reasons, to cry from joy

You taught me ways to be myself made me reveal what I am, to give someone power over me.

You taught me to be happy, 
to feel that warmth inside, to belive someone cares.

Why dont you want to be with me anymore?*"

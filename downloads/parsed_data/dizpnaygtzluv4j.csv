"event","First of all, this is for EVERYONE that I know in killeen. If it hits you and feel like it's directly to you, then I guess you're guilty of something but I just want to ask all of you nicely to please, if you have something to say about me, ANYTHING about me to anyone specially my parents, specifically my mom...let me know first. If it has NOTHING to do with you at all, then I personally think you shouldn't be saying anything anyways or before you say something, make sure you get your facts straight first...I'm tired of hearing bs and in the end, I get blamed for wut bs people say. If what you say is true then I have no problem with it but even if it's true, if it still has nothing to do with you and is none of your business, then just please mind your own. I'm sorry if all this comes off wrong to anyone...I don't mean to offend anyone but if you deserve it, then I guess you just do. I know all of you love my mom but if telling my mom my business or just straight up bs is your way of getting close to her and to be on her good side, then that's just pathetic and sad...a very ugly trait to have. Like I said, this isn't directly to anyone and I'm sorry if you know for a fact that you have nothing to do with anything...I'm sorry for wasting your time but please understand on my behalf that ever since day one here in killeen, I've had a hard time trusting people which is completely different from how I usually am...and to people that are out of killeen, out of texas, that has been affected in any way because of my lack of trust in people...I'm sorry. I try be the same ol' 8o4 VA chin.chin that always misses home, always try to be there for EVERYONE...the same ol' chin.chin that cares so much that she puts everyone before her...the same ol' chin.chin that's so friendly that she doesn't think twice about trusting people. If you haven't seen that in me or doesn't think that's who I really am then please don't judge me...it's because you probably haven't known me for as long as other people that know who really I am have and because I have changed ever since I've moved here...only a little change for the better, and more for the worse. I want my old self back but that's impossible if the people that surround me have nothing better to do but talk and gossip. Some of you reading this probably think that there has to be something that happened that triggered me to be straight up and say this much...but actually, not really. It's more than something...just thinking of everything that's happened to me ever since I moved here made me realize and made me open up my eyes how ugly people can be, in and out...how such people do exist and how they really are and it's in their nature to be such way and if you are, then don't expect me to trust you or even be close to you. I may seem like I'm being bitter and biased to some people...all I can say is I'm sorry if you think so and learn to be more open-minded and understanding. Feel free to comment and say anything that you please and thank you for taking the time for reading and hearing me out."

"event","I can't stop listening to this song for some reason. It's not only 'cause it's good...I think it's more like it fits how I am right now. Just realizing how frustrating can things get and feeling fed up of what's been happening. It's true...love songs can be so sickening, yet we have this tendency to torture ourselves by still listening to them during the worst, depressing times. This song made me realize that as much as I want to avoid certain things, I can't seem to do it. As much as we say we're done and as much as we want to say that we want to forget about it, we can't. As much as we know that we have to move on, deep down we don't want to. Another cliche but very true statement--<I>It's easier said than done</I>. Being so sick of these love songs and not being able to turn off the radio had a deeper meaning to me. I see it as trying to say that as much as you want to leave the past and bad memories behind, you can't do it and it won't seem to happen because you truly still care for that person and no matter how much pain and heartache you go through, you still realize that you love <I>him</I>. Enough said...

""<B>So Sick</B>"" 
by Ne-Yo ft. Jin

<I><B>I'm so sick
It happened so quick</B>
Looking at old flicks
<B>Tryin' to figure out
Where we went wrong</B>
The radio turns on
<B>That's our song
Waiting to hear
Both of our favorite parts
Each word is eatin' at my heart</B>
A lot of you ain't got a boo
Trying to move on
Ne-Yo tell 'em what's the first thing they gotta do

Gotta change my answering machine 
Now that I'm alone
Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cuz you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
<B>It's been months 
And for some reason I just
(can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this
(enough is enough)</B>
No more walkin' 'round 
With my head down
I'm so over being blue 
Cryin' over you

And <B>I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here</B>
Said <B>I'm so sick of love songs 
So sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio?</B>

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th</I> [<B>April 24th</B>] 
<I><B>Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Tired of dealin' with the frustration 
(Stupid love songs)
Same song even when I change the station
Don't make me think about her [his] smile
Or having my first child
Let it go 
Turning off the radio</I></B>..."

"event","It hurts too much when the person you love doesn't understand your situation and doesn't understand where you're coming from and the last thing you need is more hurt from that person by telling you that you were never there for them when they needed someone the most and make you feel like you're the failure in the relationship. I thought things were suppose to be mutual. I always thought that person was suppose to be there for you and support you...not discourage you and make you hurt more...


He doesn't understand the pain I go through everyday. I wake up everyday asking myself...why do I still wake up? What's the point of living when you're not with that someone anymore? I try so hard to push myself with school and work even though deep down, I really don't see a point of pushing myself anymore...I honestly don't. Until now that we're not even together anymore...he still tries to argue with me and it still ends up as, he's right...I'm wrong and I'm suppose to feel like the worst girl you could ever meet. I've never thought that someone that told you they love you with all their heart turns things around on you and hurt you so much with just mere words and makes you feel like that. If he does it...I guess I deserve it. He brings me down and yet, I still care for him and love him. Why is that? He makes me want to not care about anyone or anything at all anymore. He discourages me when I thought he could at least be there as a friend. I thought it's better to have someone than not have them at all. He makes me want to change the person that I am. He makes me want to not give a damn about people that I do truly care about. He makes me want to be bitter to everything and everyone that exist. He makes me want to put myself into a position where I have to suffer and create more pain for myself and everyone else that's around me. He makes me want to fail everything that I've started.

How dare can a person hurt you more when they know you're already hurting and they should know the last thing that person needs is a guilt trip? How dare can a person that says they still love you and will always love you blames you for the decisions you make? How dare can that person insist that you're moving on when you know yourself that moving on is impossible coming from a year and half relationship, coming from your very first serious relationship, coming from being convinced that that person is the person you'll spend the rest of your life with...how dare can he say I'm already moving on? How can I move on when it already hurts having just the thought of moving on???


If all you're gonna do and say is just hurt me and bring me down then just completely forget about me..."

"event","So much for a year of being with that someone you love the most. It only happens once in a relationship. A year of love, dedication, and heart for that someone. A time to spend quality time with that person. A time to look back on that past year. A time to devote our time to each other. I promise this...I promise that. Not happening. Expectations...I don't want to expect anything anymore. I shouldn't rather. I only asked for one thing and only this one time but still, I don't get it. All I ask is the time to talk on the phone the whole day on our 1 year anniversary. Not asking for anything else. Is that too much to ask? Don't promise anything anymore unless it's REALLY FOR SURE. So much for a person who claims to NEVER breaking his promises. It hurts. Tears instead of smiles on our 1 year anniversary. It's been a bumpy relationship. Not a very pleasant way to start off the year of our relatioship, yet we made it...


Regardless, HAPPY 1 YEAR ANNIVERYSARY. I LOVE YOU..."

"event","It used to be that he can't sleep without hearing my voice. It used to be that he'll do anything and try to find any way to get a hold of me just to hear from me. It used to be that he'll stay up all night just to wait for my call. Doesn't feel like he loves me as much anymore. Maybe I'm not being very understanding but he isn't either. Mutual right? Doesn't even seem like he needs me as much as he did before. I don't know why things don't feel quite the same anymore. I'm only hoping that will change when I see him on Thursday. I can't really sleep right now. Had an emotional night last night. Mom noticed the next day that my eyes were puffy and she asked why I've been crying. I tried to deny it but obviously it didn't work, seeing how my eyes were. I kept saying it was nothing but she kept asking. She asked understandably so I told her. She heard my side out and his side as well. Surprising that she didn't get mad. She thought at first, ""Did you break up?"". NO. ""Is he not going to the wedding anymore?"". NO. We're still together and he is still going to the wedding. It breaks my heart that I had to tell my mom who that person was who made me cry. He's not suppose to, yet he still does. I don't want him to, but he still does. Got some advice from my mom. ""A girl can be as much jealous as she wants to but when it comes to the guy being too jealous...it might get to a point when he'll end up hurting you physically. Just watch how he is..."" I replied with, ""He's not like that..."" And I know for sure he's not. She also said, ""Sometimes you can't always follow this *<I>points to my heart</I>*, sometimes you have to use this *<I>points to my head</I>*."" I remember her telling me about how it was heaven with my dad before they got married and turned out to be hell after the marriage. I thought to myself, I don't want to be like that. I'm scared. What if things turn out that way for me? Lyla asked me earlier, ""Do you see getting married to Russell?"" With no hesitation whatsoever, I replied with, ""Honestly, yes I do. It might sound crazy and too soon now but yes I do.""

Sometimes, it takes a song to explain how you truly feel for someone because there could be times when you can't quite explain how you really feel inside...

<I>baby tell me why
why do you question
all this love that I have for you
if you look into my eyes
and make an exception
I will show you love
like noone before

put your trust in me
allow me to be there
baby give me your hand to hold
'cause the feelings that I have
are so complicated
words cannot explain
there is only one who knows

only God knows
how much I love you
God sees my heart
and that he cares about you
God knows
that I'm thinking of you
and I'm longing for you
how I wish that you knew
what God knows

baby tell me why
what is the reason
...
'cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
[Boy] I'm down for you
and the love I have is pure
I wanna help you understand
just how I feel for you
you're the one that I can't let go
'cause the feelings that I have
are so complicated that
words cannot explain
there is only one who knows


...
only God knows I'm lonely
and all my [crying] sleepless nights
only God sees me
and everytime I think of you
only God could read my mind
God knows I tried
help you understand
and heaven knows I miss you [boy]
only God could see how much
cuz everytime you go away
I long for your touch
and when I say I love you [boy]
only God sees my heart
he sees my heart
only God knows</I>"

"event","It's so frustrating how things just fuck up at the end of the day. I hate being fucking ignored. I hate not being recognized for the good things I do and instead being recognized for the shitty things that I don't mean to do. I hate being yelled at when I'm trying to explain myself. I hate not being told nicely and instead getting bitched at like I'm at a fucking boot camp. I hate not being comforted when it's so fucking obvious that I need it. I hate feeling like I'm only the 2nd most important. I hate not being able to say what I want to say just because I was on hold. Nothing has changed ever since that talk about how I felt neglected. It might have changed that one night like a month or 2 ago when I was frustrated and crying but that was it. After that, back to the same old routine. One reason why I started going out myself more often now 'cause what's the point of trying to make time for someone when they can't even be there themselves? That's like talking to yourself when you're alone. That's like trying to kill someone in a fighting game when your opponent is dead already. It's pointless. I'd rather be told and let known that I'd be neglected for the day rather than getting neglected without notice or any heads up. I don't mind being told that that time can't be for me at that moment, that's perfectly fine for me 'cause at least I can prepare to keep myself occupied.

Everytime I get a fever, I usually get better after a day...but it's been 3 days and damn, I feel hella weak. Texass is seriously fuckin' me up. BLAH!!! Maybe I should see the doctor before I die or something...

[Edit @ 11:40 p.m.] Another night of crying myself to sleep...what's new right? I thought things were gonna get better but I guess not. I feel really weak and I was hoping he can be my strength but it's not happening anymore. It used to be like I don't have to hint anything or say how I really feel before he's there for me but now it's like I HAVE TO tell him before he realizes things. Even simple things or little things that used to be what I loved so much about relationship...I guess he's changed or is changing and I'll just have to live with that. Sorry for the constant depressing vents. LJ seems to be my only getaway/reliever (kind of) ever since I've moved here..."

"event","Walking in school this morning, all my eyes could see were couples holding hands, red heart balloons, all size stuffed animals, lovely flowers, chocolates and candies, and everything else that comes to mind for a typical Valentine's Day. I was ready to turn around and walk out the same door I entered in. I felt sick to my stomach. My heart started to ache and my eyes started to water. It hit me...he really isn't here. I had my hopes up by expecting that my daydreams would come true. I need to snap out of it and come back to reality, my bitter-sweet reality. I'm sitting here wondering why I cried so much today when it's suppose to be a happy, loving day. Everything came over me...my emotions took over me today...emotions of hate, anger, bitterness, jealousy, envy, sadness, pity for myself, and that unexplainable feeling of being so distant from the person who I want to love me the most, the person who makes my day, the person who loves me for me, the person I wanna hold, the person I long to see everyday, the person who I want to wipe my tears away, the person who I want to be here for me and nobody else, the person who I want to say ""I Love You"" to and would be able to look deep into his eyes as I say it, that person who <B>I</B> love. 

I broke down 3rd period...I couldn't keep it in anymore. I kept screaming in my head, ""Why isn't he here?! He's suppose to be here!"" I felt so much anger in me. That kind of anger when all you can do is cry because it hurts SO MUCH. I tried calling him at lunch since I really needed to hear his voice. I must've have tried calling more than 10 times and every single try got me nowhere. He never picked up...

I went to 5th period hopeless. I sat down and looked at our assignment for the day-- Free write, at least 12 sentences. I held my pencil, stared at my paper, decided to write about my day. Everything I felt inside went to that pencil he got me, down to the paper I was writing in. The bell rang and I stopped at my 5th sentence which said, ""I wore my California hoodie today since my valentine IS in California."" I stared at my paper, read everything I wrote so far, heard ""Happy Valentine's, Chin..."" from my little big brother Will, heard my VA buddy Mark ask for my chocolate, and all of a sudden my eyesight went blurred. I was crying again...I tried to stop but I couldn't. I broke down again. My teacher was kind enough to ask me if I wanted to go the restroom for a little bit and I nodded as tears rolled down my cheeks. I felt like such a weak person. I felt everyone's eyes were on me as I shamefully walked out of the classroom with tissue in one hand and the bathroom pass in the other. I called him and he picked up. I caught a glimpse of myself on the mirror while I was on the phone crying. I looked at myself and thought, ""I'm miserable.""

It hurts. I'm slowly starting to forget what love feels like and I want to be reminded and reassured of that love. That love from only one person and noone else.

<I>you can call me selfsih
but all I want is your love
you can call me hopeless
because I'm hopelessy in love
you can call me unperfect
but who's perfect?
...so what's wrong with being selfish?
selfishly I'm...
in love with you</I>"

"event","I feel like such a weak person, such a weak element in this relationship. I feel like I have no say in anything that's why I just end up crying when misunderstandings come up 'cause he overpowers me...overpowers me with his words and explanations. I'm not quite sure if that's a good thing or not but it makes me feel like he has control of everything even to the point where I just want to explain myself, it just doesn't happen. I just end up giving in and admitting I'm wrong. That's how it's been like...I'm wrong most of the time and it makes me wonder sometimes, is that really the case though? I'm a very non-confrontational person and I know for a fact that if I was in a debate team or something, I would shamelessly loose and embarrass my teammates. I guess that's how it is in this relationship...being the non-confrontational one, I can never back myself up and maybe him knowing that I'm that kind of person, he takes advantage of that chance or that's what I think at least. Or maybe he just doesn't realize that. From that kind of perspective, we're the total opposite. He's confrontational and I'm not...and I don't think I can ever be, even probably just a little bit 'cause that's just not me. One reason why I'm venting here instead of telling him myself, shows how much non-confrontational I am. Another weakness of mine that can affect a lot of things in my life...there's really nothing I can do. I just have to accept the reality that this is me...*sigH*"

Today is officially 9 months and 1 day for Chin-Chin 'n Russ-Russ!!! I'm so happy and at the same time, overwhelmed from what we've been through ever since we met. I still remember them days when I swore I thought I would never hear from him again and nothing more would grow out of our friendship. I love those poems I wrote and dedicated for him when we first started talking. It's crazy to think that now we're pretty much inseperable. For all the problems and obstacles we've encountered in our relationship so far, I thank Russell with all my heart for being the strength and hope that has pulled us through everything. Without his love and understanding, I would end up insane in a mental hospital somewhere. Without him, I would grow weaker everyday mentally and emotionally. He has been my motivation for the things I've stumbled on and I seriously can't quite explain how much I care and how much I've grown to love him this past year. Everyone would probably think that it's such a cliche for me to say that everyday I wake up, he's the first person I think about, and I realize I love him more and more every morning when I open my eyes. But who cares about cliches? As long as it's truly coming from a human being's heart, then I know I can say I mean it.

That's probably why I can't sleep, I had all those thoughts in my system. Well...that and 'cause he's not picking up his phone. I got used to hearing his voice every night before I go to sleep or even fall asleep on the phone with him. *sigH* 

<B>MAHAL KITA, ALWAYS 'N FOREVER, RUSSELL JAVIER and NOONE can change that.</B>

It's so hard to be far apart from the one you love and from that person you yearn to see and spend time with especially when you find yourself alone, even your true friends that you want to run to is far away themselves. So really, it all comes down to-- noone that you want to be there is there for you or that's how you feel rather.

I personally feel that myself right now. I'm going back to that feeling I felt the first time I moved here in Texass. I have NOBODY except for a-phone-call aways and online chats. That feeling like I have no life because all I can pretty much do is stay home and get on the computer...

I don't know...I guess I'm just getting frustrated of the fact that I'm so distant to the ones I love especially Russell. I'm already hating the fact that I'm so far away from the Barkada and for that person who has actually made me not regret moving here just because I met him, is far away himself, it's like...Wow, am I that undeserving? It's like losing something you love, then you find something else to love but then you lose that one thing too. I know I haven't lost neither my Barkda or Russell but the distance makes it feel that way...

OR maybe I'm just trippin', maybe I'm just being selfish...I really don't know. *sigH*

[edit] It's so frustrating how things happen that worry me and the least I can do is talk and can't even be there... =("

It's such a relief that things doesn't have to be hidden anymore about us especially family-wise. All I can say is I Love You so much and I can't say sorry enough for everything that you had to put up with about me this past month and I thank you for giving me another chance and I promise you I won't waste that chance. No matter how much the distance kills me, as long as you stick by me, I'll stay strong through our relationship. Your love is what keeps me going everyday about everything. I miss you so much and MAHAL KITA, always and forever...

the sun has turned to grey
at least thats how it feels to me
whenever you're away

i crawl up in a corner
as i watch the minutes pass
each one brings me closer to
the time when you'll be back
you're comin back

i can't take the distance
i can't take the miles
i can't take the time until the next time i see you smile
i can't take the distance
and i'm not ashamed
that i can't take a breath without sayin your name

but i can't breathe a hurricane
and still be standing tall
when all the dust has settled down
but i can't take the distance

i still believe in feelings
but sometimes i feel too much
i make believe you're close to me
but it ain't close enough
not nearly close enough</I>"

"event","It hurts to let go of someone you truly love when you know you have to be alone for a while to be there for yourself...to learn from your own mistakes without anyone trying to force you to. For now, I am on my own. It's painful if you haven't been on your own for 8 months, to be with that significant other that you care for so much, to have all the unforgettable memories that we've made. I can't explain in words how much it hurts...all i can do is hang in here and try to be strong to keep myself going. I've come to the point in my life when I know what I want but I stumble and ask myself, is this what I really need now? Another reason why I chose to be on my own, to figure out what I really want in life as of now. Everyday, I struggle to pray and ask for help and I can't stop for the tears to come with my prayers. Flashbacks in my mind, everytime I close my eyes, everytime I'm alone...flashbacks of my mistakes, of the pain I saw in his eyes as he told me how much it hurts. As I sat on my bed histerically crying, I felt my heart tightening up, I couldn't breathe...all I could do was scream out all the pain I felt at that point and shamelessly say, ""I'm sorry..."" I had no strength to say anything else since he couldn't decide whether to believe anything from me anymore. To hear him say such bitter words felt like acid slowly seeping through my skin. To hear him say he couldn't look at me anymore while he talked...for him to turn his back while he told me how he truly felt and for me to see him slowly fade away before my eyes. As he walked out my front door with nothing to say nor looking back, I dropped on the floor and screamed out his name several times as I cried my heart out. I tried to run after him outside as he walked to his car but all I can do was held the door open and slowly dropped on my patio floor. I still kept trying to call his name out but he showed no sympathy. To hear his tires screech as he roughly took off, it felt like it had ran over me. I tried to walk back to my room but I once again dropped on the floor in my hallway, still screaming and crying. I'm sorry and thank you for my godbrother who had to hear from me like that all the way from Virginia over the phone and for my best friend Ross to see me that way and to help me talk through things out. An hour later, he came back to check up on me and talked things out in a less harsh way. I've been called stupid so many times but this time it hurt that it made me feel like I'm the most horrible, inconsiderate person. For someone you truly love and care for to tell you so, it hits you inside just like as if that person physically hit you on your face. For that person to struggle to believe to what I have to say made me not believe in myself anymore as well...made me feel so worthless, like I no longer belong in this world. But coming to think about it, I deserved all that and the rest that are still to come and take over me...

It hurts more that on the same night that everything went six feet under for me was his last night in town. As much as it hurts for both of us, we couldn't help but put things on hold in good terms. We hugged, we kissed, we held hands for the last time until he comes back for me. Unsure of the fact of when that would be, I have some faith and hope left for both us and who knows, it may just take like a blink of an eye or it make take years but for now, I'm focused on myself and priorities and I would love to stick to it until I'm fully ready to be in a committed relationship. As much as it kills me knowing that I still love and care so much for him and knowing that that will remain the same for the rest of my life, I just need to learn to love and trust myself first. I may sound selfish but that's reality and it isn't always gonna be easy and beautiful for me and everyone else...

I miss him and love him so much and without that, I won't be able to learn how it is to be on my own right now...

I really don't know what to say or do anymore. My heart's in pieces and there is no place for me in anybody's heart. I never thought in my whole life I would be in this position and I guess God is punishing me for the wrong that I have done in the past by making me realize how it is to be here right now. I'll just end this as...I'm just a worthless, inconsiderate, lying piece of shit.

Never thought I would be listening to country but it fits my mood right now...

[<I><B>Whiskey Lullaby</B></I>]- Brad Paisley & Allison Krauss

<I><B>She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart,</B> he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night.
 
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her 'til I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby.

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la.

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la.

<B>The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself</B>
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind,
Until the night.

She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby.</I>"

I got out of bed because I wasn't sleepy anymore. LoL. just kidding! I woke up 'cause the house phone rang and my mom wasn't home and my dad was in the shower.

I feel lazy that's why I'm doing this. Thanx 2 my honey bunches of oats for the link! heehee

I'm so moody right now. I think my friend's coming for a visit soon...oh yea, did I mention I'm so lazy? =P

Last night I had to ummm...I forgot what I had to do last night. =X

I want to tell the world that I LOVE my one and only CHEESECAKE!!!

I am updating this journal for the first time in ages, because I've been in prison.

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Psyche! I WISH! That's #1 in my Christmas list by the way. ;)

I want to say thanks to mY ChEeSeCaKe for being the ONE and ONLY!!! =D

At least I finally updated right?! Props to ""Gregor's Semi-Automatic Livejournal Updater"". I wouldn't have updated if it wasn't for this. Ok...enough said.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this thought - sharing your life with strangers on the internet is the cheapest form of therapy available. Leave a comment and tell me I'm beautiful.

"event","Ever since I moved here in TexASS, I never had the freedom to do anything. Sometimes I wish I wasn't the youngest and sometimes I wish my brother and sister were here so that my parents wouldn't be so overprotective and would be more lenient on me. I don't get it...I'm almost 17 and I can't even go hang out with friends. Is that asking for too much? I mean, I'm so fucking homesick already and I can't even have my own fun here. What the hell? I feel like I'm in jail, being watched with every move I make. I'm suffocating. 

My mom in particular has always something to say about the things I do...she starts assuming shit that's even far beyond the truth and that makes me really angry. I'm so mad right now that I already lost my appetite...I'm suppose to be studying for my finals but I can't anymore, I feel sick to my stomach and on top of everything else, it's that time of the month. UGH!

Having old fashioned Filipino parents isn't easy at all, teenage-wise. It's almost like hell, even though I haven't been there, I'm pretty damn sure it's close to hell. They tend to contradict in almost everything I do, I can't even go see a movie in a normal Friday night...

Ahhh...I can't even finish this entry...I don't wanna be here anymore, I need my getaway already-- Virginia ='("

I agree. Tex-ASS IS weird. Both the people AND weather. Yesterday, it was such a nice day. The sun was out and there was a slight breeze...it felt good outside. Then today, I woke up to a dark, cloudy sky with thunderstorm warnings on TV and the radio. They even said there was a possibility of hailstorms. WTF?! Just a few minutes ago, it started pouring and thundering. The wind started to pick up and lightning just randomly shoots out of nowhere... o_O

After a half hour or so, the sun's starting to slowly come out. It stopped raining, the wind is calming down, and the sky is clearing up. I can even hear birds chirping outside my window!

Dang...I swear the weather here is always having its mood swings as well as the people. I seriously think Tex-ASS is cursed by some odd evil forces. muahahaha. Imagine living here. 

Weeeiiirrrdddooosss!!! >=X

[Edit 1:50 p.m.] The sky is starting to get dark and cloudy again. Wind's picking up, AGAIN. what the hell...?!
[Edit 2:26 p.m.] There's thunder and lightning now, it's pouring...looks like it's already 6 pm outside. The weather here is going PSYCHO."

"event","Today went pretty good. I woke up late as usual, hopped in the shower as soon as I got up. Then <B>Kuya Chris</B> came to pick me up to go to Ross'. We ended up chillin' for a while 'cause <B>Romelyn</B> couldn't go and <B>Ross</B> wasn't home yet...

A couple hours later, <B>Kat</B> came. Her and I ended up going to Ross' house instead while <B>Kuya Chris</B> went to some party. When we got to Ross', she introduced us to her ""brother"", <B>Sean</B> and his girlfriend, <B>Julie</B>. They drove all the way from Kansas to visit <B>Rossy</B> here in TexASS. That's so nice and sweet of them. =) But yeah, it was good meeting them...they seem really cool. <B>Julie</B> ended up doing Ross' hair 'cause me and <B>Kat</B> had no idea how to do it. We just sat there in amusement while she did her hair. LOL. 

Then, <B>Skeeter</B> aka <B>Will</B> walked from his place to Ross' house to chill with us for a lil bit. It's always fun to have that boy around. All we did was laugh at him pretty much the whole time 'cause of his goofiness. *HONK HONK!*. ""Looklooklooklooklook..."". LMAO.

We waited until <B>Ross</B> got ready for military ball since we all wanted to see her in her dress. She looked sooo HOTT! hehehe. But frealz though, she looked so GORGEOUS...I was so happy for her. Around 6:30ish, <B>Kenny, Tina,</B> and <B>Fidel</B> came to pick her up. <B>Kenny</B>'s face lit up when <B>Ross</B> came out of her room. I was seriously ready to cry 'cause they looked so cute together. And on top of that, <B>Fidel</B> and <B>Tina</B> got down from the car...<B>Tina</B> looked sooo PRETTY! *insert the awww's...* hehe. Ross' dad took pix of the couples and the whole time, <B>Kat</B> and I were at the side sighing...it's so awesome to see couples like that but at the same time, you get kinda envious...BLEH. <B>Tina</B> kept telling me I better not cry so I held my tears of joy back...*sigH*

As they all left for military ball, me and <B>Kat</B> dropped off <B>Will</B> at his place, went to my house, waited for <B>Glythe</B> to come over, then we all went to <B>Kat</B>'s house. <B>Kat</B> and I decided to cook fried chicken, fries, and last but not the least, RICE. =D Our dinner was HELLA good...I couldn't get up from the table 'cause I was sooo full. =X

Right after we finished eating, we decided to stop by at <B>Will</B>'s since him and <B>Josh</B> were bored. <B>Russell</B> was already there, then a few minutes later, <B>Junior</B> got dropped of by <B>Joel</B>. We didn't stay too long, just wanted to say wassup to everyone then we left, dropped off <B>Glythe</B>, then here I am at my house now.

So that was my day. Pretty chyll not so boring day. It's good to go out and get some fresh air sometimes specially when the weather is nice out. I wish everyday would always be relaxing and chyll like that...makes me miss VA and <B>Barkada</B> more."

"event","What a break! SIKE! =P Nothing special for me...just time to relax, chill, and sleep in, oh yea...and ummm...GRUB! *gasps* hehe. I swear I've been grubbin' non-stop this spring break...easy mac, spam, rice, chinese food, etc. YUMMMAAAYYY!!! =D

We're already going back to school on Monday...waaahhh! >=X

There were a few productive things that I've done so far, actually. Finally started driving, HAD TO clean all the mud outside the house from people's shoes (BLEH), been cleaning around the house...and uhhh...that's about it. LOL.

The other nite, we went to Kat's/Crys' house. We were rollin' deep...haha. It was me, <B>Romelyn, Robert, Glythe, Lyla, Russell, Josh, and Will</B>. We watched <U>Hardball</U>, ate, played with <B>Zeus</B> ""da dawg"", and <B>llessuR</B> had the kick out of pickin' on me, like ALWAYS! He tried lockin me in the bathroom, tried putting me in the tub and wet me, and tried putting my feet in the toilet...that KROD! Overall, 'twas fun and chyll... =)

Yesterday, woke up around 1:30ish, fried me some <B>Spam</B>, ate it with rice, then waited for <B>Glythe</B>, my lil big brasha, to come over. When he got here, we both realized that we had absolutely NOTHING to do other than go on the computer, listen to music, or watch movies/cable-less TV. I was going crazy and started screamin' at him for fun...we were HELLA BORED. Then we just started picking on each other...we were THAT BORED. Then I had the craving for something fruity...haha. So I made him walk to <B>Sonic</B> to get me a <B>Strawberry Fresh Fruit Slushie</B> and he wanted a banana split. Then <B>my J.boo</B> called a lil bit after Glythe got back, talked to him for a while, had a fun convo with him that made my day like always. Jason's phone call made up for the boredom I had. But then Glythe had to leave 'cause his dorky brother *ahem<B>Russell</B>ahem* picked him up to go somewhere. I started getting lonely all of a sudden so I decided to lay down and listened to some slow jams. Next thing I know, it was 10:30 pm. I guess I fell asleep...? *sigH* 

Then a few hours later, I was on 3-way with <B>Nicole</B> and <B>Chris</B> from VA. I had so much fun talkin' to them. =)

Now here I am blogging, chattin' with my Rice Nucca/long lost twin/sistah, <B>Ross</B>. We talkin' about random ish since she can't sleep even though she should be getting her beauty sleep for military ball. <B>Romelyn</B> and I are going to her house later to help her get her hair did. hehe. We gonna make her look HOTT just for that whore/dum-dum head/kaka mouth/pee.pee face/other lil big brasha of mine, <B>Kenny</B>. *inside jokez* LMAO.

Special shout.outz to <B>Jason</B>. It's always good to hear from you specially from those hella late phone calls (i.e. talking 'til 5 a.m.)heehee. remember, GUESS WUT?! MISS KITA! guess wut else?! MISS NA MISS KITA! guess wut else?! I MISS YOU MORE AND MORE! guess wut else?! I MISS YOU 91348781613454167874164411 times MORE! and last but not the least, guess wut else?! I MISS YOU FOREVER MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE! enough said??? =D

i felt that gap
that i didn't bother filling in
a gap that i wished

my words and actions showed
the bitterness i had inside
i held back everything 
i had in mind.
""don't give in...""
is what was constantly
playing inside my head

confusion struck me
it hit me
and left myself
lost and wandering...
searching for answers

part of me
was yearning for your
attention and affection
but my instincts told me
i don't need it
i don't want it

words that were said
made things such a blur
i pretended i didn't hear anything
i felt so numb
and hurt at the same time

part of me was relieved
with the things u said
but the other part of me had 
so much DOUBTS

i read your mind
and i hope 
you read mines as well
'cause with last nite
i regained and
was left with
a pinch, only a pinch...

lookin at him 
ain't da same no more
i can't even see him
like how i used to

before, having his presence
was such a relief, such a sweet, relaxing feeling
all my worries subside
everytime he was close to me

but now, it's different
just one glance,one look at him
my stomach tangles up into knots
bitterness takes over me

never had so much hate
and despise like this
towards someone
i truly cared about

i feel used
feel like just another girl on the sideline
a damn back-up plan
wut did those hugs and kisses mean?

it felt like
it meant something
but now,with his actions
that i witness before my eyes
they now mean
only NOTHING

wut else is there to do?
wut else is there to say?
please don't come running back to me
'cuz all i'll do is push you away...

they got each other
they can have each other
noone's stopping them
may they live happily ever after...

typical, unrealistic, fake, impossible
fairy tale bullshyt...

enough said."

tired of trying
don't wanna be here anymore
don't wanna try no more
i'll never get to witness my miracle
i thought i saw something in him
i guess i've thought wrong all along

unkept promises, false hopes,impossible miracle
i'm slowly realizing...
caring so much for someone
can hurt as much back and perhaps more...
caring is pointless
trying is useless
all the tears i held and still hold back
turn into anger, frustration
but everytime i find myself alone
these tears can't be held any longer

i've always thought when that miracle happens,
it would capture my soul,
would complete and fulfill me
but now, i know i can NEVER be complete
part of me would remain empty
until that last tear drops...

why do i care so much?
why do i try so hard?
i don't belong here
i'll never belong here"

"event","Geez...haven't updated in a long ass while. Everything has been a whole lot of something and a whole lot of nothing lately. Does that even make sense? hehe. Oh wellz...

Life has been...peachy. School and friends have been keeping me occupied or rather keeping me from being homesick, even though I still am. Speaking of being homesick, I've been pretty stressed about my plan on goin back to VA this summer. We're pretty tight on $$$ right now and it's not even up to me anymore if I should go to VA or not...it's up to- if I'll have money by June. I want to go back so bad...I HAVE TO...I JUST DO. I need a break...a REAL break/vacation = home = VA = Barkada...*sigH* =\

On a non-stressful note, I thought my Valentine's Day was pretty...simple & sweet. My good friend, <B>Will</B>, stopped by to drop off some roses, chocolates, and a very thoughtful card. Awww... =) 

I've been chyllen with <B>Kat</B>, <B>Noc</B>, <B>Ross</B>, <B>Kenny</B>, <B>Robert</B>, <B>Josh</B>, and <B>Will</B> lately. We don't do much...except just hang out, grub, talk, and crack jokes. Things we do that keep us from being bored...LoL.

Hmmm...what else is new...ummm...nothing really. TexASS, still the same. K-town, ghetto ASS ever. I'd never thought I'd be this exposed to the world...real scary but I guess that's reality.

The weather here is so...moody. One day it's warm, the next day it's windy and cold, and the next day it's raining, then thunderstorms, then it gets warm again and out of nowhere...it'll start snowing. LoL. Yeah...SNOWING in TexASS. It snowed like 2 days in a row...it was the day before valentine's day and on valentine's day. The first time it snowed, my mom comes rushing in my room screaming, ""chin...it's snowing!"" I replied with, ""snowing?! we're in texas 'nay...we're not in virginia anymore...it doesn't snow in texas!"" And the next thing I know, it was snowing frealz. haha. I was so happy but it was such a tease cuz it didn't even stick to the ground...hmph =( But then on Valentine's Day, my mom wakes me up at 7:30 in the morning saying, ""chin! look out the window!"" Half-asleep Chin-Chin forces herself out of bed and looks out her window...""Aaahhh!!! YAY!!!"" I guess it snowed overnight and decided to stick on the ground til early afternoon. I was psyched! heehee. Like what my friend <B>Jennnifer</B> said, ""valentine's day was a snow day...mother nature got it backwards. I thought Christmas was supposed to be white..."" I know right! A white Valentine's rather than a white Christmas...odd and yet, pretty romantic, I think. Even though there wasn't a particular someone to be romantic with...hehe =P No worries, less worries...

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you

The sky has lost it's color
The sun has turned to grey
At least that's how it feels to me
Whenever you're away

I crawl up in the corner
As I watch the minutes pass
Each one brings me closer to
The time when you'll be back
You're coming back

I can't take the distance
I can't take the miles
I can't take the time
Until the next time I see you smile
I can't take the distance
And I'm not ashamed
That I can't take a breath without saying your name
I can brave a hurricane
And still be standing tall when all the dust has settled down
But I can't take the distance

I still believe in feelings
But sometimes I feel too much
I make believe you're close to me
But it ain't close enough
Not nearly close enough 


<B>Yasmeen- When Will It Be Me</B>

I see the couples are walkin` by
Feel like I
Don`t wanna be alone today
So glad no one can see what I hide
Deep inside
How it feels to be
The girl who never gets the right guy
Tell me why
When there`s so much I`ve got to give
I wake up reaching out in the night
Ready to hold him tight
`Til I realize
That nobody is there

When will it be me?
When will I be the one
Somebody`s dreaming of?
When`s it gonna be?
When will I find my heart
Lyin` inside the arms
That never let me go?

I`d really like to know
When will it be me?

My friends seem to have all the love
(Feels like love.)
Knocks on their door and walks right in
I know that I am worthy of what I`ve been wishing for
I can`t wait no more
Love`s nowhere to be found

Feeling his tender touch
(Lying in his arms.)
Talkin` bout forever together
Givin` him all of my love
That`s been trying to break free

Don`t wanna be alone
No more
I`m telling you what I need
I want someone who loves me for me
And when will it be?
Wonder when will it be me?

I ask myself
When will it be me?"

It's been HELL but luckily, I got my friends to keep me sane throughout the day. *sigH* Tuesday started out straight up shitty: woke up late, missed the bus, looked like a bum...everything was just on the downside. Although I thought my day would stay like that, it was brightened up after school...THANX guys.

With all that (not much) said, I've been alright for the most part...or should I say, been TRYING to be alright? Have a lot going thru my head...trying to figure out things for myself...but for some apparent reason, I can't focus on things that I should and need to be focusing on the most (i.e. school). I know I shouldn't let things get in the way of school but at this point, I can't really help it. I'm really trying though...I really am. 

<B><I>Wished and hoped that it would have worked out in the long run, it's been awesome while it lasted though, really. As for now, it's bitter-sweet. Bitter as lonely and miserable as I am and sweet as to knowing that you're happy and keeping a lovely friendship.</I></B>

I have so much ish goin thru my head that my mind's going blank. It's like when there's so much things that you have to do then you end up not doing any of it 'cause it was WAY TOO MUCH and you either got lazy or didn't know where to start so you just sit there and waste your time thinking when you could've done everything already. <B>PROCRASTINATION</B>. oh geez...that word fits me very well. Sad but true =\

I was thinking of pulling off an all nighter by scanning pictures the whole time but I don't know anymore. I want to but then I don't. Hehe, so indecisive huh? Another word that fits me well-- <B>INDECISIVE</B>.

Hmmm...I think imma hit the sheets then. Hopefully when I wake up, that'll be a brand new start for me (only for <U>SOME</U> things)...meaning, getting shyt done right away without hesitating to do it.

Did I just say my new year's resolution without knowing that it could be or should be one??? Ahhh...what am I talking about?! Am I even making sense?! Let me stop and go on an unconscious mode. It's almost 3 in the morning...I should just sleep it off whatever it is. BLEH.

Lots of laughs and tears shed as well. If I could, I would recap each and every moment I've had with everybody but I'll just leave all the memories to those who I've spent it with and let them treasure it as I do the same. Looking back at this year, maaannn...it's been like WHOA?! I don't know...it's been a rollercoaster...highs and lows, crazy loops and sharp turns, both slow and fast speeds. I've met a lot of new people, some I've gotten really close with...some had kind of faded away, some have stuck around...some are just there and still , I guess...? There had been a lot of changes...specially towards the end of this year...unbelievable and unexpected changes...also very overwhelming ones...

"event","Tonight, I stepped outside
Gazed upon the moonlit sky
The air felt so fresh and cool.
Oh, I only wish I could hold you tight.
I laid my eyes upon the full moon.
All I could think of, was that summer
when we met in June.
Tonight, I was alone
All by myself.
Felt so lonely, hoping,
wishing upon the stars
for your presence being.
I thought, ""This could've been a perfect night...""
Cool breeze, clear sky,
full moon, twinkling stars...
I paused, thought again,
""No, this could not be a perfect night for something is missing...""
and it was YOU, only YOU that was missing.
If you were here,
we would share this night,
cuddling and relaxing under the moonlight.
But who knows, maybe tomorrow or the next, again we might.
Oh so I wish we might.
I closed my eyes for a second.
All I could think of was you.
Right when I looked up the sky,
you were the first and only person
that was on my mind.
I imagined the full moon as your entirety,
the stars as your twinkling eyes,
the breeze as your gentle touch.
Oh, this could've been a perfect night.
Now I stepped outside again.
The full moon was gone.
The stars disappeared.
The wind seems cold and strong.
Maybe the world realized
you're not here yet by my side...
So long, next time,
waiting 'til you're here,
oh perfect night.

Such irreplacable feeling
So heavenly, so soothing
Pointless if not reciprocating.

<B><U>Hopeless Romantic</U></B>
So many questions linger on my mind?
How can your love be so blind?
I search for answers I cannot find.

Is it wrong to fall for you so easily?
I had no clue that your past experience could reflect on me.
What am I to do to make you believe and love me unquestionably?

Wishin' you would recognize my earnest endeavor.
Causes me such misery to know the reasons hindering us from being together.
Why can't we just try on love for once and maybe, just maybe, it will last forever.

<B>School.</B> Still ghetto, still boring, still stressful. And I'm guessing it'll stay that way until my senior year. I can't wait to get out of here...BLAH, enough said. =X

<B>We finally got a house.</B> After looking at like 5 different houses, the 'rentz finally decided to settle on one. Funny thing was, it was the first one we looked at but they kept changing their minds and started looking at different ones and what do we now, they came back to their first choice. Tsk, tsk, tsk...so indecisive. Now you all know where I got it from. =P But yea, this week's gonna be pretty occupied due to the fact that we have to move our stuff in the house. I'm not really too excited packing my ish and taking them out AGAIN but I have to. Now it's official...come visit my ass already, 8o4 headz! =P

I went to Sophia's today and grabbed me an application. It's a new store at the mall here...very nice...like Forever 21. Also stopped by Gadzooks. I have a good feeling that I have a chance of getting hired this time since the holiday season is just around the corner. Wish me luckz! =D

<B>Jason's DA BEST.</B> Yup, my J.boo decided to give me a random ""I miss you"" call last night. It was unexpected but I was really happy about it. I was actually feeling down before he called 'cause of that last entry I posted. Thanks to him, I've been smiling since last night. My mood drastically changed from shitty to HELLA GOOD. It just feels good to know that somebody close to my heart thinks of me and misses me every now and then... =)

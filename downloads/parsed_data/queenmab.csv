I used to write longing for an audience to respond. that has changed. Now I would prefer to be left alone in my blueness. Perhaps, I always say, I will write more this year. I doubt it. But I can say, as surely as can be, that my heart is still broken. Like the sentimental vase you tipped over accidentally. You couldn't bear to throw away the shards. Now, they sit on a dusty mantle for the day you actually buy some fucking glue and put them back together. But, you won't. In fact, you knew you never would be able to fix it. You just didn't want the guilt of it lying in a trash heap somewhere draped in a stranger's bloody gauze. So you kept it, as a reminder, of the thing you had, once beautiful, that is now irreparably broken. I mean, who throws away broken vases or broken hearts? They are simply things you learn to live with, even if you cut your hand on them every once in a while."

"event","I left the job I have held (and hated)
since I moved to NYC. I had been dreadfully
unhappy there, most intensely for the last
6 months or so. So, I went around looking for new
jobs. I found two. One, at a hip little neighborhood
joint where they wear funny t-shirts and everyone is
a ""creative"" type, and another, where they wear t-shirts 
but not as cute and where the crowd is young, moor-less
and, kinda boring. Although you would think I would pick
the former, I picked the latter. Why? Because it came to me
with tales of 1,000 dollar pay days. Come to find out, I hate it.
Now, I have pretty much hated every job I have attempted in New York.
I think it's because I am over being in a restaurant. However, this 
one is different. It's not like any bar I have ever worked at. There is
this weird serving element and a pooled house. That shit is crazy. It does
mean that you make more money, but this place is just nuts. It's so busy 
that people don't really have time to get to know one another and there
is no need for any kind of personality, because you are basically a machine. 
They throw money, orders and milk bottles at you. There is so much to think about
one cannot help but forget something. The people who come in, for the most part, 
are fairly nice, but tonight I had a guy that's lucky that I didn't scream in his face.
I was on a double today and things went alright. I am still having trouble with pooling of tips sheet and the math on that. However, I was counting money at the end of the night and this douche throws an order at me. I was counting, the manager poured him his wine. I was told to put it under another girl's number and I guess I just forgot his order completely.
Well, five minutes in he decides to throw a fit, like a child. It was great. It included such hits as "" Yeah, your sorry. Just go make it happen"" and the manager calling him an asshole. I then, in a moment of upset, apparently forgot to clock out and got a text asking me about my numbers. I also know that the manager will want to talk to me about what went down with that dick. I am not in the mood for this. Any of this. I have been stressing out about this stupid job since last Saturday night. I have been asking lots of questions and going slowly, trying to get it all; trying not to make mistakes. I think they think I'm slow. Maybe I am. All I know is that it isn't really how I imagined it. I am sure I hate it. I am also sure that I could make a lot of money there if I stayed. I am considering quitting tomorrow and then going to an interview. I doubt I will. I will probably go in tomorrow to be called out for all the lack of attention to detail and whatever else they want to pin on me. It just feels wrong. Every shift I imagine being somewhere else. Trying not to feel how empty it all is. I really need to stop thinking like I'm a character is some Satre. I think they assume I'm stupid. Maybe I have been acting that way, what with all my questions and such and my occasional mathematical hiccups. I just don't wish to be reprimanded for a mistake. I guess, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. I really wish I felt 
like I fit in there more. I don't like feeling like I am the oldest person working there.I don't like how nerve-wracking I find all this. I don't want to complain to my poor boyfriend every night. I know he's sick of it already. And why should I complain? From the outside it's a sweet deal. On paper it looks fantastic. It just feels wrong. Shouldn't I listen to that?"

"event","Dear 2012,

Please be better than 2011. Now, that shouldn't be very difficult,
seeing as how 2011 was a pretty shit-tastic year. I am sure that you 
will say that it was a year in which I did a play and went to Nicaragua,
but I will remind you that it was also filled with some serious bullshit
drama and inescapable and obsessive fantasizing. If possible, I would
like to leave 2011 as far behind in the dust as I possibly can and move 
on to bigger, better, and more helpful things like getting a career off the
ground and losing this weight I have been carrying around (for my ENTIRE life!).
Hoping this year will be better than the last may be an act of futility, but 
I'm an actor; I'll take on any role and make it work. With that said, 2012,
be good to me for I plan on being good to you. Let's work together and make 
it the beginning of a series of great years. What do you say? Yes?! Wonderful.
I think we this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

Yours,

No, really.
I hate it. 
I have been trying, for months now, 
to convince myself that its all okay 
and that I am just having a life crises 
or something like that, but no. Its official.
I hate my job.

Why, you might ask.
Oh, so many reasons.
The most pressing being that I am
not making enough money.
The most trying, that I work for some shady fuckers
with questionable morals et. al. and HATE the clientele.

You know how you watch 'Seinfeld' and 'Curb your Enthusiam'
laughing because you think that those archetypes can't possibly exist?
Guess what, they do and they all live on the Upper West Side.
I should know. I deal with them everyday and let me tell you, its trying.
REALLY trying just as I am really trying to get the hell out of this job.
Truly, I just don't want to have to deal with this shit anymore.
I am too old and too tired to be standing for 8 hours at a time 
and only making 100-150 a shift. I tend bar in NEW YORK CITY!
Don't you think I should be making more money? I sure do.

Anyway, if anyone even reads this anymore and has any leads let me know.
Craigslist is only infrequently helpful and truly, I would love to get the hell
out of this business and on to something else. 

Sorry for the bitchfest, I am just feeling truly stuck in my current
environment and I want out, out, OUT!

I had a few interviews, but nothing seems to have panned out.
I am hoping that something does. Something has to. 

Please?!

Here is to moving on and moving up."

it as a kind of loss. I look at the entries I have written

That is just criminal. Part of it was being busy
and part of it was not having my own computer
to write on. Now that I have pulled my ""new""
computer together I can write more regularly.
I inherited my boy's old computer and its alright
with me. My computer crashed and I haven't had
the money to get it fixed. So, a 6 year old Mac
will have to suffice for now. 

Much has happened since last I posted.
I went from being a server to a bartender
fairly quickly and I am really enjoying being
a reader for YPI. I just have to get on writing
reviews of these plays. 

Hmmm...how to give you the gist of 
how things have been going. How about lists?

Things I love about living in New York City:

-My apartment is cheap, roomy and coming together nicely.
-I live across the street from a Dunkin' Donuts.
-I have lost weight because of all the walking I do.
-I became a bartender in under 3 months.
-There is great Eastern European food around me.
-Taking the subway means no more tickets.
-I live near Coney Island, corn dogs, AND The Cyclone!

Things I hate about living in New York City

-My apartment is as far as possible from Manhattan and my job.
-The Dunkin' Donuts across the street is Kosher, so NO sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches.
-I gained weight back because of the delicious burgers at my job.
-I hate my job.
-There is ONLY Eastern European food near me.
-Taking the subway means HAULING groceries like I'm a mule and getting home much later than needed.
-The people in this city and their 'affected' way of being is just  insulting and infuriating.

So there you have it.
I am still poor, but things are looking up.
My relationship is really great, I am doing work, although peripherally, in theater, 
I have a great place to live and great friends.

It could be worse.
It has been worse.


I am so glad its not anymore."

"event","Today was to be just like any other day
and yet, it wasn't.

I made a decision today that I feel was very important.
It was one of the harder decisions I have made in my life
and although I feel it was for the best I think one cannot
help but feel reticent when one has forgone was dreams (again)
in order to do the things that should have already been done.

All this is to say today I ""grew up.""
Today I made the decision to 
take back my life and stop floating.
I made this decision without even know it.
It came to me out of the ether and crept up quietly.

I feel that, today, when I say I want to be active in my life again
I feel it in my body; my soul.
For too long I have been lamenting the past
and forgoing the future for what?

For nothing.

I realized today that in order to have a future
I must plan it. I must surrender the past 
and craft my life to be just what I want it to be.

I suppose, erroneously, I believed that life 
presented itself to you, but this is not so.
You present yourself to life.

God, I wish I had learned this sooner.
But not just learned it, felt it like I feel it now.
This is the real thing.
This fear of failure, this desire to reach my potential, 
this practically and realism; all these things are real
and necessary. Perhaps there are people that see this
early on. Perhaps I am a ""late bloomer"" but oh well.

I am going to stop talking.
I am going to stop writing about what I plan on doing.
I am going to do.

I am going to pay off my debts as best I can
and no longer make excuses.

I have never felt so serious about taking charge
as I do right now. 

This decision was desperately hard to make
but I will live up to it. I will make the sacrifice worth it
in ways I could never do before.

Where I am at this moment is a direct result of 
every choice I have made, conscious or not, so far.
I am going to face my life head on and change what is 
ineffective and foster that which is creative.

Now, now its finally time."

"event","Dear Friends,

I have been looking for a place to live in NYC.
My friends and I have found a lovely little place.
But guess what?!?
My credit is so bad that I can't even be put on the lease.
I will have to sublet from my friends, like the loser I am (on paper.)
People are judging me despite knowing nothing about me
except that I couldn't pay my therapist 5 years ago.

So, friends, I must fix my credit.
I don't know how...In fact I am beginning to think
that it is more expensive to live than to die.

Its sad when you realize you are too poor to live.

I am crushed by this information and fear there is no 
way out. I never understood how people could become
so bereft over debt, but I am there.
I mean, I just fucking sent over $700 to my student loans
and it doesn't matter on my credit report.

I AM TRYING!!!! 

But they don't put that on your credit report.
At this rate, I will be living with my parents until I am 40.

But if you are rich...it doesn't matter. 
You can have your dreams come true
and drive to them in a BMW.

I am so sad I could vomit up my wasted life.


So, please send donations to 

Me
@ po box 450
Marlboro, NY 12542.

I promise I will spend it on overdue bills
and not bullets."

"event","So I had this dream last night:<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Go On When I Close My Eyes..."">I was living in a city, in an apartment.<br /> When you looked out the window it looked<br /> as if you had put Buffalo, NYC and Chicago in a blender.<br /> It was getting to be late evening<br /> and everything was shades of gray and brown.<br /> I turned from the window to see a few of my friends (now faceless)<br /> and told them it was going to be Christmas in a few hours <br /> and that I should really drive home to see my family.<br /> They agreed and we all pulled our things together <br /> and jumped in my Jeep.<br /> When we got in the car we got onto the highway<br /> and the typical things that happen on a long car ride began.<br /> Loud music, loud talking, fighting and of course, the cast<br /> of characters changed. A few new faces were added.<br /> We decided to stop at a rest stop<br /> and when we went to get back in the car<br /> my parents were there, my dad was buckling <br /> himself into the driver's seat<br /> and my mother was shifting to the back.<br /> I told my father that I was driving and took the wheel.<br /> He moved over to the passengers side.<br /> I tried to merge onto a tiny mountainside road<br /> that took you out of the rest stop, but my tires <br /> slipped and we almost went off a cliff.<br /> We proceed on, with caution.<br /> Halfway on this trip, I realized we were not only<br /> going home for Christmas, but we were on a mission.<br /> A mission to, presumably, assassinate someone of high ranking.<br /> The cast of characters changed again and stayed pretty stable<br /> at my friends Becky, David, three girls that I think were girls from my job<br /> and Nick. Everyone, but Dave, was sitting comfortably in the back of the Jeep<br /> which had become larger and now houses seats that were shaped<br /> like a sectional; in a square with one missing side.<br /> At some point I decided that I wanted a cigarette.<br /> I pulled over into a parking lot that was at UB (even though we were now hundreds of miles away<br /> from ""Dream"" Buffalo) and walked to the bus stop to see if anyone had a cigarette<br /> for me. Two girls were standing there with big gaudy necklaces on<br /> but instead of pendants they had Nicorette Inhalers hanging from the chains.<br /> It was Hilarious. I asked the one girl for a smoke and she gave me something that <br /> looked like a Pixie Stick; all green.<br /> It fell on the ground and when I rose from picking it up<br /> the other girl was wrangling a piece of Nicorette out of<br /> the package. The other girl it my smoke.<br /> I just looked at the two of them quizzically.<br /> ""How is the quitting going?"" I queried?<br /> ""Great!"" They said in unison.<br /> So, I chatted for a moment<br /> until I realized that something was going on<br /> near my truck.<br /> I ran to the driver's side only to see some guy<br /> in a baseball cap and baggy shorts<br /> herding three girls into the my car.<br /> I had left the keys in there.<br /> My first thought was to pull him out<br /> and beat his ass, but I realized the door was closing.<br /> So, I jumped into the back of my truck (which had now become<br /> an attached trailer) and slumped down on the floor.<br /> I sulked, feeling frightened and defeated.<br /> Then after awhile I looked out the window and realized<br /> that we were in Puerto Rico.<br /> I was livid.<br /> My anger gave me strength <br /> and I climbed through the nearest window<br /> which just so happened to get me back<br /> into the Jeep.<br /> I saw that my friends were there<br /> and had apparently been helpless.<br /> I was so upset that I just started grabbing<br /> the perpetrators and throwing them out the window as the<br /> Jeep was motoring along.<br /> These people made fantastic sounds as they hit the ground.<br /> Two of the girls had divined that tucking and rolling<br /> when being thrown out of a moving vehicle, is probably the safest way<br /> to stay alive, but the last poor girl was apparently not as blessed as the others.<br /> She just fell with the most macabre thud I have ever heard.<br /> Frightening.<br /> But no matter, I was angry.<br /> I grabbed the guy who was driving ,and had apparently started all this,<br /> and threw him out last, with great fanfare.<br /> I took over the driving and we all felt better.<br /> There was apparently one girl left, but we realized that she had been forced<br /> to go along with the baggy shorted man's ruse and let her join our rag tag team<br /> of revolutionaries.<br /> As we drove Dave and I plotted in the front seat, though I am not <br /> sure as to what was said.<br /> We finally arrived in what looked like LaGuardia<br /> and I wondered to myself, why are we in an airport?<br /> I told Dave that we shouldn't park here because<br /> our car had to be registered to park in the area and our getaway<br /> could be ruined.<br /> He said to just abandon the car and he would buy me a new one.<br /> In an effort to make the Jeep look more innocuous I had, only moments<br /> before, washed it and taken off the bumper stickers, so the suggestion of<br /> abandonment really irked me, but I went along with it.<br /> We were on a mission.<br /> The group of us walked around casing the area.<br /> Outside they seemed to be setting up an area for speeches.<br /> There were seats, subtly colored banners and matching carpets.<br /> We walked up a few marble steps into the building.<br /> Dave and I took the lead<br /> and we entered into an art gallery in progress.<br /> The walls were being erected from graffiti laden<br /> plywood and one man was painting the floor<br /> as if he were Jackson Pollock. The floor was made of one way glass.<br /> Nick came up behind me and put his arm around me.<br /> He simply looked at me and smiled.<br /> I knew and he walked away.<br /> (That feeling has stayed with me all day.)<br /> We finally reached the main ballroom and there<br /> was a sparkling buffet happening.<br /> Suddenly, we were all well dressed and we knew what we had to do.<br /> We were on a mission.<br /> I walked up and down the buffet lines.<br /> My heels clicked against the marble floors <br /> that were buffed to eye sparkling shine.<br /> Nick gave me one last loving look<br /> and Dave gave me the signal.<br /> Just as I was about to fit the tear drop sized<br /> detonators under the tables on the line...<br /> </div><br />My phone rang.<br /><br />Goddammit.<br /><br />It was one of the best, most riveting and realistic dreams<br />I have had in so long. <br />I miss my friends.<br />I miss Buffalo.<br />I miss...<br /><br /><font size=""3""><b>So, tell me your most exciting/meaningful dream(s).</b></font><br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br />xoxoxo<br />~M"

not as late as my first bartending job.
I used to stay at work until 5 am.
Of course I was drunk most of the time
and hardly&nbsp;noticed the time fly by.
I was also younger and thinner then.
Ah, the good old days.

I have been moody as hell lately.
I&nbsp;don't know if its pms
or a mental breakdown
or too much gluten in my diet.
All I can say is that I&nbsp;have been
grinding my teeth at night
and wanting to pummel&nbsp;folks by day.
I need money.
I need a real job.
I need&nbsp;a vacation.

OY!

Anyway, nothing of import to report.
I have been working and attemping
to go to the gym regularly.&nbsp;
I am still, of&nbsp;course, devouring all the chocolate&nbsp;
I can get my hands&nbsp;on.
All in all, not so bad.
I don't really know what else to say.
I am sure that there is alot swimming around in my head
but I am not as apt to share as I used to be.
The emotional exhibitionist&nbsp;has grown older
and&nbsp;wiser. A&nbsp;a&nbsp;lady never shows ALL her cards.

I am learning that mystery makes them stay

In the summer I was raking in ridiculous amounts of cash<br />and yet, the winter has bled me dry, along with my fucking car.<br />I just haven't figured out how to balance money and spending. Yes I am&nbsp;27&nbsp;and I know I should have figured this out by now, but I just haven't, ok?! I think I should go to&nbsp;The Barnes and read up on how to save and how to make the most out of a meager fucking salary.&nbsp; I hate to admit it, but I should&nbsp;get another job for the time being. I just want to get the fuck out of here and get to NYC. I know I know, same old complaints. Even I am tired of hearing them, but its just that this job really let me down. I started with the summer&nbsp;making great money. I had been broke for so long that finally getting money made me want to go out and&nbsp;buy things that I hadn't been able to afford.&nbsp; I wish I had saved more and that my car was not a&nbsp;piece of shit.

"event","There is alot to tell, but I just haven't been much in the mood lately.
This time of year makes me feel nostalgic and melancholy.
That would explain why I haven't been much in the ""holiday spirit"" in 
about 5 years.
I have been re-evaluating things (as I often do close to my birthday)
and have realized that I have, now and then, fucked up really good things
in my life. It just makes me sad to think that I had what I wanted and 
didn't even notice it. 
I have written so many letters that were never sent and some that were.
I have letters that I have yet to write.
There is so much swimming in my head anymore, I don't even know
where to begin.
I loved you. 
I loved you all, in my way.
Some more than others, its true.
But you, with the shining eyes, mellifluous voice
and penchant for Sinatra it is you, who at this moment,
I am longing for.

It is funny how things come to you at the oddest hours.
I will always wish the best for you.
I will always hope that someday our meetings will not be 
so infrequent.
For a minute there I thought...
but I guess that look in your eyes wasn't what I thought it was.
And that's okay.

&nbsp;I just miss you, that's all."

"event","Why I even waste my breath.

Obviously, no matter what I say to my father, he will never stop drinking.
Nothing I say matters. It never has.
Even when I threaten him with not walking me down the aisle
or telling him that I will go down to every bar he frequents and 
threaten certain death if they serve him it doesn't matter.
I am a woman, so therefore it does not matter.
I am his daughter, that helps negate it too.
He is so old school that being an alcoholic was practically the ""thing"" 
you grow up to be. The sign of being a man.
You work all day so you deserve to come home, drink
and ignore your family.
Nice dad.
Thanks.
Here I was, wasting my breath for over an hour.
Trying to be understanding when he talked about his feelings
(which he rarely does) and trying to make him understand
that all he needs to do to make things better is to stop drinking
and, like always, the conversation goes in one ear and out the other.
Just when I think I am getting through, he makes some shitty remark
and I realize that it was all just bullshit and he never really cared about what
I was saying.

So fuck all this."

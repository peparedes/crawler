NICE to those INSIPID little monkeys, answering their STUPID letters. 

My hands... DIRTY! THE DIRT WON'T COME OFF!

President... Ha! What a joke. President of what? *His* fan club!

How they love him! They think he's a god, but I know...

He's as mortal as we. 

The idol of millions...




He's a fool! 
Blind silly little fool.


Lying there sleeping.

How easily I end all the madness... 

with these hands! 

AND WITH THESE HANDS I HOLD THE FATE OF MILLIONS! Just one TWIST... then it's over.






Just... one... twist... 


Pretty much how I feel currently"

"event","Dear Journal,

Hey! It's me! Andrew!  I just installed the newest version of Winamp, and you will never guess what I found out about it!  Dont tell anyone!  Promiss?

Internet TV!

They have channels for everything.  I just watched 4 hours of Nickelodeon's Doug and I nearly exploded with seed goo.  They have everything you can possibly imagine.  ANYTHING!

Im planning on watching every Soprano episode ever made followed by Ren & Stimpy.  Then I am going to die of being over amused and starvation.

Bye for now!"

"event","Why is autum so suck down here? Im missing out on the leaves turning color, the sent of burning wood and leaves, the delicate grey skys, brisk winds and the antisipation for Holloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, my birthday, and New Years.  

Its too surreal to actually fell the change down here. With the constant weather, it feels as if Florida chose random days out of the year just to celebrate their holidays.  The only thing that reminds me that the world is revoling around the sun is the fact that the days grow shorter.

Its not all about the holidays, its about change.  Sure I enjoy nice cool breezey nights in Florida.  The thing is, I can enjoy that up north for about six months and then enjoy the aesthetics of season change.  My two friends who used to live up north that now live here are seeing what I mean. It is getting to them too.  I have been living the same two days for two years: Hot or rain.  Sad to say but I am actualy excited for hurricane season.

Now it seems that I have to stay longer becuase I failed a class for assinine reasons and now I have fallen behind.  Great.  

In lighter news,  my hair is falling out.  Seriously.  I found out the other day while shampooing my hair only to find my hands where covered with soapy suds and strands of my beautiful hair.  Stupid heretitary crap.  My mother's side of my gene pool has to offer me diabetes, heart disease, male pattern baldness, obesity and spinal problems.  On my dad's lovely genetic menu, there is only one dish: Cancer.  My friend Ed said it best ""Your a perfect canidate for death.""  Litte does he know he is a perfect canidate for death too. Muawhawhaw.  *Lawl* violence.

Considering im a ""man"" now and I will be 22 in Decemeber, I think it is about time I get my legal shit together.  Starting with my will.  Oh man the things I will request if I die.  If your lucky enough to make the cut, and if I croak, you will find out.  

Well, between now and till the time I die I have one thing to say...

"event","whoa nelly what a week.  I have done everything from making my own nuclear war head to chasing people down with nothing except an insane laugh and a chainsaw.

went clothes shopping.  Now I actually look thinner.  go me.  I have been losing a lot of weight and i feel great.  Getting a lot of compliments which is always hard for me to accept becuase im emo like that.  I wish I could threaten my body to lose it faster by gun point, but if my body is anything like me, i would tell my captive to shoot me out of spite.  

This quarter is going ot be hell for me.  I honestly dont see any hope of happiness or relaxation for the next 3 months.  Why cant it be decmeber already?  I want to hit up vegas so bad it hurts.  Not only that, i could really go for some scotch and a cigar.  I cant drink until december.  

This livejournal bored me, and I think I might quit for good.  All it does is cause me to get a bladder infection. 

In a differnt light, my step mother is due to deliver my brother in about a month.  hopefully if she were smart, she would give me the baby and let me train it to be a womanizing killing machine.  

Time to spread the t-virus and live my fantasy: to be a zombie hunter and eat beef jerky and chilli.

My friend Stevenoff and I were interviewed by pop culture ca-ca network MTV so I might be on TV.  And when i was in baltimore fo rthe yankee game, a foul ball came very close to us but the people seated behind us caught it, so i might have been on TV twice.

<P>In a nutshell, this is a perfect description of the ""WB"".</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v697/gamewizard83/HitlerFrog.jpg""></P>
<P>What really erks me about the WB is, there are people in their offices, stitting around a table, and all of them actually <EM>agreeing</EM> on bad ideas.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; <STRONG>THEIR WHOLE FUCKING NETWORK.&nbsp; </STRONG>Why not save all the money spent in college and degrees in marketing and R&amp;D and spend it on a gaggle of retards to come up with new&nbsp;ideas for shows.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'll start with&nbsp;<STRONG>Buffy</STRONG>.&nbsp; Now, when the series began,&nbsp;I thought it would have been a&nbsp;cool idea, then I realized&nbsp;I should have blown out that notion out of my head with a bullet.&nbsp; ANY&nbsp;Movie&nbsp;turned into a TV series is a horrible idea.&nbsp; It worked in the 80s, when people had talent.&nbsp; Ghostbusters the cartoon was bad ass.</P>
<P>Back to what I was saying... Buffy started out on the WB starring an array of&nbsp;now pop culture main stram actors like Sarah&nbsp;Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, and Adam Carolla wannabe Nicholas Brendon.&nbsp; The plot of Buffy started and ended in the first Buffy movie back in 1992.&nbsp; How you can streach all that into, what, 88 seasons of worthless steaming bubbling&nbsp;dino shit is beyond me.&nbsp; <STRONG>SHE SLAYS VAMPIRES, GET OVER IT.&nbsp; </STRONG>I heard they were going to have Wesley Snipes as a special guest as Blade, and chop off Buffy's tits and use them as his personal candy dishes.&nbsp; That would rule.&nbsp; Oh, and if your reading this Alyson Hannigan, I would LOVE to penitrate you with a flute... through your fucking skull.&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 243px; HEIGHT: 217px"" height=439 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v697/gamewizard83/bandcamp.jpg"" width=365></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>One time, In Adobe Photoshop, I actually used the Canadian leaf brush... and I made this poor illustration!</FONT></EM></P>
<P>Thanks for accepting a role that was totally pointless and making all 3 movies&nbsp;suck.</P>
<P><STRONG>7th Heaven</STRONG>.&nbsp; Shows like these make me wish I were in a <FONT color=#000000>comatos stupor for idiotic reasons, like watching the first gigasecond of the show. Is <EM>gigasecond</EM> even a word?.... It is now...&nbsp; 7th Heaven is like the Brady Bunch, only worse.&nbsp; Again, how do you make something from bad to worse.&nbsp; Brady Bunch was the shit in its time at least.&nbsp; All those kids who live in the house hold&nbsp;should have been beat from the begining.&nbsp; I'm talking about the characters AND the little shit head actors.&nbsp; Whats the point of having kids if you cant crack em one in the teeth. Thus rendering any plot for every episode useless.&nbsp; These Characters remind me of devoted Christians.&nbsp; I HATE DEVOTED ANYTHING that regards any religion. Fuck, do somethng worthwhile you brain washed robots.&nbsp; In the show, the characters go through ""real life"" delemas and accomplish them together as a family. Cute.&nbsp; Its been done&nbsp;I think about 700 times in Full House.&nbsp; The father should be an in-the-closet shit eating&nbsp;petifile.&nbsp; The daughter&nbsp;should be a goth and totally&nbsp;try to sacrafice her siblings.&nbsp;The son should be a bastard Jock who has a girlfriend and openly cheat on her in front of the girlfriend's parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the youngest should be a clepto maniac.&nbsp; It would be to good to be true.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>Gilmore Girls </STRONG>is just a waist of time and money, and most of all, all if any nourons popped to come up with such a show.&nbsp; To be honest, i really dont know what the show is about.&nbsp; it has a ton of women actresses in it, and I have no idea why it isnt on the WE network.&nbsp; Too much estro dragon for me to handle.&nbsp; I think i know more about French politics than I do with this show.&nbsp; Fuck that shite.</P>
<P><STRONG>Smallville- </STRONG>Superman was created like 60 some odd years ago.&nbsp; And since then, there have been a gaggle of TV shows, Comics, Spin Offs, Spin Offs <EM>from</EM> Spin Offs, and Movies.&nbsp; From what I have gathered from the legacy known as Superman, Lex Luthar is alwasy bald, everyone has kryptonite, and no matter what you do, Clark Kent always finds a way to resurect.&nbsp; I caught lke 10 min of Smallville the other day, and the episode was about how three witches posess Clark and Lex.&nbsp; WTF!? Witches!?&nbsp; Is there no end to this mutany? </P>
<P>Ill just go off an say that<STRONG>&nbsp;Ellan Degeneres </STRONG>is my arch rival and my primary goal in life is to smother her innar organs on my face.&nbsp; Nothng would make me happier. </P>
<P>So theres an ugly&nbsp;mexican guy called <STRONG>George Lopezm, </STRONG>and he has his own show.&nbsp; His character, whom is himself (lame) isnt even a fry cook NOR a landscape maintenance slave.&nbsp; Boo.&nbsp; Mexicans never get anything.&nbsp; WB needs to stick with reality.</P>
<P>Your a redneck if you even think about watching <STRONG>Blue Collar TV.</STRONG>&nbsp; Stop making $20,000 a year and watch something tastfull, like UFC.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>Kid's WB</STRONG> is even worse.&nbsp; If I ever, EVER caught my kids watching Kid's WB, I'll kill their mother right in front of them with a strawberry Snapple bottle, and force them to eat her remains.&nbsp; All they ever air for these hooligans are videogame themed cartoons with catchy brainwashing theme songs and plots even has Ernest Hemmingway spin in his grave to the point where light cant escape him. (Old Man in the Sea sucked Hemmingway).&nbsp; And to make it even worse, click on this link: <A href=""http://kidswb.warnerbros.com/web/stuff/stuff_display.jsp?id=LON"">http://kidswb.warnerbros.com/web/stuff/stuff_display.jsp?id=LON</A></P>
<P>Attention children, if you watch this, god will kill&nbsp;all cute and&nbsp;fuzzy&nbsp;animals.&nbsp; This is a spit in the face for like 2 and a half generations of loyal Looney Tunes fans.&nbsp; Im pretty sure a lot of souls where condemed to hell for this show.&nbsp; If anyone, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, and&nbsp;Friz Freleng have a right to rotate in their graves, bore a hole to the center of the earth, and summon a volcano right where that stupid water tower is.</P>
<P>In conclusion, FACK YOU WB.&nbsp; I hope you die.&nbsp; No shred of decentsy or pride is left in that shallow husk of a studio lot.&nbsp; Burn is hell.&nbsp; Thats All Folks.</P>

I need a job or something.  I got to keep my mind off this.  Thankfully I dont have to wait another 6 months to go back home.  Luckily I'm goin to Las Vegas in December for a week and get rid of ALL of the thorns in my side, for a while anyway.  I wish I graduated already, got a shit load of money, and start my own game company up north and live the rest of my life content.  Hopefully I'll hit big in Vegas and maybe part of that dream can turn into a reality.

I dont understand what triggered it.  I feel empty, but not depressed.  I dont know how to explain it.  I guess all that surpression finally exploded to a thirst that i cannot quench.  It could be the fact I havent played a new game since Resident Evil 4.  I guess video games supress my primative needs for a companion.

Back in Fort Lauderdale after having a very intresting vacation.  It felt like a dream.  Seems like I didnt even leave school to go home.  I've decided besides school, there is nothing here for me in Florida.  NJ and NY have soul, Florida doesnt.  My heart belongs up there.  Got to see all my friends and more.  It was almost like a class reunion.  I couldnt believe the faces I saw when I got back.  Oh man the things we did:

Last but definatly not least, Frank wearing Ed's Jacket pretending to be Ed... I think.

There was much more insanity to be had.  I witnessed Frank light his whole hand on fire, that was fucking halarious.  The plan was for him to run around the house and greet one of our friends in the front yard.  Frank didnt even make 5 feet before he started smacking his hand on the ground.  The fucker's hand was totally in blue flames.  As we all know, blue flames means business.  He also ate a Ritz Cracker on fire.  Dont believe me? Take a look at this:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v697/gamewizard83/iday3.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"" height=350 width=450>
See, this is one of the many reasons Frank is Half of Jesus Christ half incarnated.  We decided it was best if I had the other half.

There was also the usual lesbianism, drama, and all that jazz.  It was like having front row seats for a soap opera.  Ah man.  Good fucking times.  Now Im back here, with no one to chill with because all my friends are either working, going to class, or have stupid girlfriends (I dont think the girlfriends themselves are stupid, just the fact my friends have them is stupid).
Thats it for now I guess.  Oh yeah, I lost another 10 pounds in a course of a week.  37 pounds in 3 weeks.  wowzers.  I just wish my aches and scars would go away.

"event","This is it.  Pre-op directions are to fast 24 hours prior to operation, and take a high potent laxative to ""flush"" out my system.  Spending my last day as a beast on the throne.

Monday at approx. 11:15 am, I'll be proded like a scientist play thing.  I wont be back until Wednesday afternoon. I wont have my cell on me either, so no one will hear from me until then.

Its funny. All week I have been nervous.  Today, I feel content.  Im going in guns blazing (or what Josh would say: axe swinging).  I am sure I'll be in uncomfortable pain, but I am focusing on the end result.  I <b>really</b> need to play tennis again!

Hopefully, I will be feeling ""normal"" a couple days after I get back from the clinic.  I am just going to take things one at a time.  

Well people.  Its been a good ride.  I dont need to ask you to wish me luck, because I know most of you will do it anyway.

<i>Cheers!</i>

"event","For the first time ever in my 21 years of exsistance, I am actually scared.  The thought that I will never be the same haunts my thoughts every day.  I have seen the reality of things, and I am not sure if I want to be apart of it.  I will be happy with myself, and I'll be more active, and above all else, healthy.  

I have adjusted how I am and it is now appart of who I am.  My attitude toward things might change, but I fear that it will change for the worse.  Wheather I be more cocky or more discusted with other people I have yet to fore see.  My judgement towards people has been, for the most part, have been shallow.  Thats only because I know they have the same attitude toward me.  Lets face it, people just suck so damn much.

Im not talking about my friends.  I am talking about people in general.  I just wish people would treat me the same if I were who I will be in a year from now.  I dont think I can really trust other people anymore. I dont think I will hadle the new attention I will receive, good or bad. 

I have a double edge sword, yet one blade seems more dull and easier to grasp.   I just cant accept the fact that people are going to have a different attitude toward me in the years to come.  I am too used to handling things my own way.  I have established my own social way, and I sure as hell not ready for a change.  I worked with what I got/had. 

I truely am greatful I have chosen the friends I have, and I hope they feel the same about me.  To those selected few, thank you.

It is impossible for me to win."

<P>I have a theory concerning men and women.&nbsp; Its pretty astute, I think.&nbsp; I pretty much use this theory to explain women behavior.&nbsp; As a noble member of the male half of the species, I have decided to shed amoungst my brotheren some light.&nbsp; Its as simple as Ying and Yang, Religion and Science, Bill and Ted.&nbsp; Prepare yourselves because what I am about to explain to you this very moment might have your brain recuircut itself to a stupid morphous blob that it is.&nbsp; Here it is:</P>
<P><STRONG>Men</STRONG> dont care<BR><STRONG>Women</STRONG> care too much</P>
<P>whoa. </P>
<P>Ok before I start getting 18 comments from these 2 people who would probably argue my hypothises and shoot down this intelligent fact, let me explain myself.</P>
<P>Every male is born with a thing called a concious.&nbsp; There are two personas:&nbsp; <STRONG>Angel Guy</STRONG> and <STRONG>Cool Guy</STRONG>.&nbsp; Now Cool guy runs the show about %90 of the time, leaving Angel Guy an almost untapped rescource of good advise/sugestions. Cool guy is basically the Fonz, but this doesnt exactly mean you will act like the Fonz.&nbsp; The Fonz had authority, you however, when dealing with the opposite sex, do not.</P>
<P>Moving onto the females.&nbsp; Each one is born with an inner <STRONG>Estro</STRONG> (estrogen) <STRONG>Dragon</STRONG>.&nbsp; Estro Dragons breathe pure estrogen into the Corpus Callosum section of the brain, affecting judgement, emotions, and rationality.&nbsp; Now, you see, Cool Guy and Estro Dragon cannot coenside with each othe no matter what.&nbsp; You would probably have an easier time producing antimatter with a garden rake and a siamese retard.&nbsp; Now, depending on what mood the emotional fragile beast is in, you can avoid getting ripped to shreds by juggling Cool Guy and Angel Guy.</P>
<P>How does this explain my theory?&nbsp; Im about to get to that.&nbsp; I have simulated a scenario using 2 characters, <STRONG>Jack</STRONG> and <STRONG>Jill</STRONG>.&nbsp; </P>
<P><BR>Jack and Jill have been going out for six months, and have decided that thay are both very much in love with each other.&nbsp; The first few months were memorable and everything seemed like something out of a fairy tale.&nbsp; Until one day....</P>
<P>*Scenario**</P>
<P>Today Jack came over to Jills house.&nbsp; It was a normal day, both spending quality time with each other.&nbsp; they were both debating what to do, and they both agreed to pop in a movie.&nbsp; But which one?&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Jill</STRONG>:&nbsp; I really want to see the English Patient, beacuse I am a girl like that.<BR><STRONG>Jack</STRONG>:&nbsp; ...nah, Pirates of the Carribean, beacue pirates ROCK!</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Estro Dragon</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; psst, Jill, its me sweety.&nbsp; Rationalize with him.. He is a man, stupid and lazy, he will give in, he doesnt want conflict.</P>
<P><STRONG>Jill</STRONG>:&nbsp; Well, I really want to see it I was told this is a very good movie</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Cool Guy</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; Hey man, like give her the ""I mean we dont&nbsp;<EM>have</EM> to watch pirates, its really up to you"" speach.. she will symophys with you and give in.&nbsp; This will totally chick totally bend over backwards to please you.&nbsp; And if she does play you out, you can alway fall asleep.&nbsp; this plan is full-proof<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>Jack</STRONG>:&nbsp; Well I mean, I guess we can watch the English Passafist or whatever.. whatever you wish.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>ED</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; oh that bastered, how dare he!</P>
<P><STRONG>Jill</STRONG>:&nbsp; Well uh, i mean... do you really want to watch this?&nbsp; beacuse we dont have to...</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>CD</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; ""awe man, she is doing this shit again.&nbsp; this is going to take like what.... 3 minutes to decided?&nbsp; jesus.&nbsp; You know what? screw it...just say you dont care and go through with plan B</P>
<P><STRONG>Jack</STRONG>:&nbsp; No no, go ahead lets watch this gay movie and get it over with<BR><STRONG>Angel Guy</STRONG>:&nbsp; ok now that was stupid... hey are you even listening to me?&nbsp; fuck this im leaving</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>ED</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; Oh no he didnt!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Estro Drama Dragon rears its ugly head and spews the deadly hormone onto the quivering pulsating mass in a rage.<IMG style=""WIDTH: 272px; HEIGHT: 248px"" height=366 src=""http://fbma.tuwien.ac.at/~e9325658/images/dragon.png"" width=342></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><FONT size=1>OH SNAP, ESTRO DRAGON!</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>Jill</STRONG>: hey i happen to like these kind of movies because being a girl I like to tourture you with trival shit and make things into a big fucking deal, and this movie triggers my emotions</P>
<P><STRONG>Jack</STRONG>:&nbsp; I really dont care what we watch, I honestly dont..<BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>CG</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; dude, its ok to lie to a girl, but for god sake dont lie to yourself.<BR><STRONG>Jack</STRONG>... put in whatever movie you want, I dont care</P>
<P>Estro Dragon countines to pollute the once delicate psyche into a waist land of pure hate and emotion.</P>
<P><STRONG>Jill</STRONG>: so i guess that means you dont care about us then... fine!</P>
<P>Jill storms out of the room with tears forming from her eyes.&nbsp; she steps ouside and begins to cry. Jack is sitting inside wondering what the hell just happened.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>AG</FONT>:</STRONG>&nbsp; Hey, did I miss anything?<BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>CG</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; yeah man, where were you? that bitch just totally beefed<BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>AG</FONT></STRONG>:&nbsp; *sigh* lets go outside and ill take it from there.</P>
<P>Jack, being a guy who knows if he didnt fix this, we would be in an emotional rut for a month.&nbsp; And being a guy, he really doesnt want to deal with emotion... because that would cause drama.&nbsp; Jack then gets up and walks outside and Angel Guy totally soaks up all the estro bio goo.&nbsp; After 10 minutes of appologizing and making up, they both go inside and enjoy the English Patient.&nbsp; Jack fell asleep accoring to plan and was awaken by nudges from Jill confirming if he saw the part that made the movie sad. </P>
<P>So there you have it people.&nbsp; Scenarios like this can be avoided if you slay the dragon.&nbsp; I guess what I am trying to say is that guys have it made.&nbsp; Lets fact it, being a guy just rocks way to hard.&nbsp; </P>
<P><BR>****DISCLAIMER****</P>
<P>Women, please take this with a <U>grain of salt</U>, This was for kicks.&nbsp; I dont need your bitching, because that causes drama, and drama sucks and apparently you guys hate it.&nbsp; For something worth complain about, you sure do like to swim in it.&nbsp; I also dont want to hear ""well thats semi true but *blah blah blah* and i know more than you because i had X amount of relationships...""&nbsp; No, again.. I dont want to hear it, because <STRONG>I am right, and you are wrong, no matter how much you want to argue</STRONG>.&nbsp; thx</P>
<P>Guys, we rock, women suck..Just remember who ate the forbidden fruit first and caused all the drama since the dawn of time.&nbsp; Dont get yourself into trouble becase of a woman.&nbsp; Now if it were for TWO women then I say maybe.</lj-cut></P>"

""What if, on a crowded street, you look up and see something appear that should not, given what we know, be there.

You either shake your head and dismiss it, or you accept that there is much more to the world than we think. Perhaps it really is a doorway to another place. If you choose to go inside you may find many unexpected things.""  -Shigeru Miyamoto

47 percent?  wtf?  wheres the other 53 percent?  Like, one of the questions were: Would you laugh at someone who was crying over a dead pet?  I specifically clicked ""yes"".  It wasnt just a little click , it was a click so mighty, lumber jacks came knocking at my door asking if they could borrow maple syrup.  My point?  I dunno.  Im pretty sure laughing at someone's misfortunes is a big sign of assholery."

"event","<P><EM>Due to the fact that I am highly amused to random nonsence, I have taken Mike's (dethfrog) response from my ""Why do we exsist here and what is my purpose of my life"" rant,&nbsp;edited and&nbsp;made it into an actual entry of its own.&nbsp; I had to share these words of wisdom, for it would be selfish of me to keep these words to myself.&nbsp; Enjoy!</EM></P>
<P>Somtimes we say things and people hear them. Other times words come out of our mouths and we look at people and they say ""yeah.""&nbsp; But really ""yeah"" means ""Huh?""</P>
<P>So what&nbsp;I have to say to you is when grandpa stops wearing pants when company comes, It may be time to start inapropreatly rubbing the dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we shouldn't feed them choclate but sometimes we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;You cant be bent out of shape about anything.&nbsp; Life is fun, especially when blow jobs are involved. Sometimes&nbsp;I wanna kill myself because&nbsp;I have math homework. Other times&nbsp;I wish&nbsp;I was dead because my father wouldn't buy me a hamburger that day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Tempremental and&nbsp;very unstabel grounds we have&nbsp;walked on for years, [so]&nbsp;why start preteneding now that everything diffrent?&nbsp; Ethier somthing happens or it doesnt.&nbsp; Really thats [why]&nbsp;I've been involved in so many productions of ""Annie"" its sickening.&nbsp; And it always ends the same: underage drinking and stachitory rape.&nbsp; Whos your your daddy warbucks now?</P>
<P>Cant waste any more time gaying up the air waves of life.&nbsp; Ethier we get our shit together or we start dressing up like our favorite characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be Mario and I'll be Yuki Shin Shin the Magical Turtle with they abitlity to win spelling bees and make littel japanese school girls blush.&nbsp; ""Oh shin shin your the coke-a-coley-est. Happy time fun game rock in rollllllllllllll!!!"" </P>
<P>So really what im saying is: fuck everyone and everything.&nbsp; Im not waiting for [a]&nbsp;dimension door to open up;&nbsp;I have another way of leaving because this planet sucks. </P>
<P>Stop! Stop it now!&nbsp;I know your pleasureing yourself so stop!<BR><BR>Love, Dad (aunt fat guy)</P>

"event","Wondering why my dinner didnt come with salad. And on that note, why do they call it ""tossing the salad""? 

Miscellaneous thoughts run through my warped mind finding answers constantly. I think sometimes that the guy whose life i took wasnt really worth the shock factor of his wife who mistreated him anyway, because she would masturbate to his picture and not have sex with him.

I feel my inner organs operating. most people ignore those impulses called ""feeling"". how the spoon was invented i havent the slightest. i am glad the japanies dont take advantage of it. Blowjobs are quite possibly the greatest thing ever made by man besides Cookies n' Cream flavored Ice Cream. but dont take my word for it.

Good thing toilets dont complain, becuase if i were a toilet, shit would go down, literally.

Great Caesers Ghost that monkey has a curly erection! 12 maidens shouldnt be the last number of things that blindly worship baby jesus, they have to have good enough reasons to milk them cows. Speaking of cows, could I borrow an Omlete!?

Greasing your hair back now a days isnt very popular. Neither is confetti. its cool though, no one really cares. Who gives a shit about big tits when little tits have more character and pizazz. Oreos are best served cold. 

The pope wont die because he exists on another plane of existence fighting his rival: the grim reaper. The only physical remittance that he left behind was a shriveled up shaking old man who can barely speak. however the pope in the other plane of exsistnce and is acually a super sayian whos fighting death intensely. 

Why do people order cheese burgers when they really dont taste the cheese? dont get me wrong, cheese is fine and dandy. honestly, whens the last time u ate cheese with something and actually tasted the cheese individually? its a conspiracy. Kind of like dinosaurs.

Why arent there any pinecones in florida?  These floridians dont know the wonders of decorating pinecones.  the color red is a whore.  My dog refuses to eat peanut butter anymore.  The back of my eyes are telling me to let them go.  They want to kill again.  Vladimir is an awsome name.  Its the name of the earth-child sitting next to me.  He looks like euro-trash.  I have a hankerin for life.  

I dont get hugs as much as I used to.  Maybe becuase i smell.  Maybe its because no one has long enough arms to embrace me.  I was burning my mom's hair while she was alseep.  It smelled bad.  The coolest thing in the world is when you fall asleep, because you cant recall exactly when you fall asleep.  I crave Secilian Pizza with x-tra cheese and garlic.  that would make my day just a wee bit.

Bologna should be spelt like this: Baloney.  It would make more sence I think.

"event","I dont know what grieves me as of late.  I seem to lost my steam, my ambition, and my passion for being here.  I am greatly homesick, but thats something I can tolerate.  I started to realize I have no necessary talent to make a career of.  Sure, i can give myself to having a great imagination and ideas, but what good is it if i cannot put it on paper.  

I feel my friends i have known here since i stared that faithful october have grown tired or bored of me, so to speak.  I could see why though.  Story of my life it seems.

Mad drama around this place.  Maybe i should start believing that people have auras and energy that affects the way we feel so i can blame my shitty mood on that. This doesnt mean I wont help anyone if i feel they want or need it, but sometimes i need a break.  I will never take that break as long as i am around the people who i care about.

Then theres June 17th.  That day will be the official New Testament of Andrew.  The date keeps creeping ever closer  I fear that this wont work, and my fixation will take the best of me.  I cant allow it to happen.  I let myself down too many times to fuck this thing up.

I have been thinking too much.  I dont know if it is a phase or not.  So many sources that think they know why I am here, or any of us for that matter. Am I here to be the loving passionate person who will shield and help people from anguish and agony to the point where i would sacrifice myself for the person i care about like my cool psychic aunt said i am/was, and that i have to find a balance?  Did I really have prior lives that i experienced due to my mother's hypnosis?  Or was it my brian producing a hallucination that pieced together from miscellaneous experiences and thoughts?  Is this plane of existence really hell, and there is no fiery torturous afterlife?  Is Heaven really a place to be told ""go back and get your shit straight""?  Does our energy/soul travel to another universe and exist in a realm we cant even begin to imagine?  Or are we just advanced animals who have primal instincts and needs, and we disguise it with laws and morals.  maybe my problem is that i have no faith, and as a human being having the need worship a higher being or authority, and follow those laws and morals.  Does love exist, and on that note, has anyone actually really experienced it without taking it for granted?*  

I regret reading the bible multiple times. 

I dont know what my fate or destiny is, but i do know i want to have my name left behind when i die either in a history book, a piece of software, or in cement. I dont want the fame, but i want to prove to people i made an impact on the way they think and mostly my life meant something more meaningful other than the funny passionate guy that can beat any video game with his toes.   

*Note- its a rhetorical question... deal with it*"

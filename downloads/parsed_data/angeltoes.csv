"event","im okay.

him and i were never really even that close.
we may have said i love you a lot back in the day, the days i was to young to remember.
and as i got older i never heard it nor said to him
until about a year ago.
he told me it, so non chantantaly...like it was no big deal
it meant so much to me, after we got off the phone i cried i was so happy.

we were never that close though.
i never had one serious converstation with you about my life, dreams, goals.
but everytime i see a movie where it shows a father and daughter love
i cry, everytime. never fails.
i know you love me, i know you will be there in my life for the big events
when i graduate college, my wedding day, when i have children and so on and so forth.

but.
yeah we never were that close
and now knowing you are on the other side of the world
i feel like i took it for granted.
even though we fought more than we ever got along.
you would always take care of me.
you never let anyone else hurt me...but you...and you would aplogize in your own ways.
and as i got older...you decided to let me finally be me...to bad mom doesnt really still.
and...yeah even though we never really were that close, i really am missing you today

I love you Dad
Happy Fathers Day

i havent updated in...days? weeks? months?

life is a-ok.
i'm so sick of complaining about it, and have been for awhile.
i've gotten better at growing up, and realizing when to act like a child.

word of advice
act like a child at happy, exciting, kodak moments times
act like an adult at sad, mad, depressing times.
so many people do it the other way around, and i did too, but its shifting.

cereal is so god damn addicting.
and i really want to befriend a celebrity.
just so when my mom calls and asks me what i'm doing today i can say ""Oh not to much just going over to Angelina and Brad's house going to go play with the kids for awhile"" 
that would be so fun/ny

I have a year and 3 months left at school.
and i'm going to owe $40,000.
that is a lot of dollar bills
i wonder how $40,000 would look like in $1 bills.

that is so much money
and its going to be more, because...hi interest is the devil.
how the hell am i going to do this?

i need an amazing job or an amazing sugar daddy that loves my boyfriend as well when im done with school.
i personally am hoping for the amazing job however a sugar daddy would be a good constelation prize.

i was going to go on the Price is Right and win $50,000 grand playing Plinko, but now that Bob has retired, i just wouldnt feel right about the whole thing.
i can always go on Lingo...anyone else wanna come?

im so tired.
i have to register tomorrow morning for summer classes.
woopity doo dah.

i don't know how to end these entries, maybe thats why i dont update.
i want to write every detail of my life before i stop writing and i can't do that.

i decided to be cheesy and buy cosmo (the magazine) for the sex moves, i'm excited to actually try some of them out.

i just took two.
so far for my finished classes I have one A and one B and two more to go.

one of my projects is a forecasting project and my partner (Becca) and I are forecasting lingerie for '08. 
its pretty fun, but the poor girl has mono and now has food poisioning but she is still helping out a great deal. Yesterday her and i walked all over the fashion district and went to some textiles and fabric stores and got some of the goods for our project.
I can't wait for this project to be over because when it is the quarter is OVER! and I get 2 weeks off.
For 4 of those days Justin and I are going to San Francisco and staying in the most adorable hotel ever. 
and we're going to take bart to berkeley so i can show him my favoritest spot in the world, and were going to take it to fremont so he can see where i grew up and of course we're going to be touristy and walk along the golden gate bridge and go to fishermans wharf and all that sillyness.

so about that apartment...well i got it if i want it :) justin and i are going there tonight to look it over one more time to make sure everything will fit.

i'm so tired.
i want a nap but i need to study and work."

"event","its been so long since ive written a real true defined entry.
now...im not saying i am, but im waiting on a delivery and have fortythree minutes till i start on some homework.

life.
well...its hectic and amazing.
the past 10 weeks at FIDM have been a whirlwind of hardwork,excitement,fears,morehardwork,justinshardwork,some more of justinshardwork,being so incredibly tired,neighborhoodies,neighborhoodies,neighborhoodies,paint,paint,paint,getting nothing lower than a 89 on a project,the smell of rubber cement,visually pleasing things to look at and a lot of boba tea and naked juices. soooo yummy.

i learned a lot in these 10 weeks. not so much about vocabularly or what a allocator versuses a buyer does, or what a CEO and a COO do differently, or what are the 12 main color schemes, how do you create a marketing analysis, a full complete competitve analysis, learning how to make an awesome powerpoint presentation and knowing the name of every shoe designer anyone wears at FIDM.
i mean i know this stuff.
but i've learned so much about myself.
i've learned how far i will go, ive learned i am capable, ive learned its not easy, ive learned you need to sacafrice a part of yourself when you invest into something else, ive learned people are stupid, ive learned people are smart, but yes...ive learned that i am now the type of person that loves to be busy, doing something...i dont know what im going to be doing on my 3 week break...im so use to finishing a project or studying at the laundromat and justin haha, he said ""me too"" he has done a lot the ""designing"" for my color/design theory class, i do the painting he does the drawing. I cant draw and hes an amazingly talented artist. hes my hero without him...i wouldnt have survived these ten weeks. 
his text mesaages that state ""you...we can do this project"" and similar ones have made me realize i am not alone.

my mom hasnt been there so much lately, she has a lot on her plate, i understand.
i wish i could tell her everything ive gone through these last 10 weeks...even the parts where ive learned to stash a headband and a pair of earrings in my bag (its a fashion school) to where ive learned how to write a 45 page paper on a huge channel including their target market, location evaulution, their owl merchandise mix (colors,prices,sizes,styles) and thats a lot for a customized clothing store, the history theres more...but my brain is so exhausted...and then i decide to not just turn in a binder cover...but since i did my report on neighborhoodies we (justin and i) made the binder into a hoodie. 
heres a photo or two of it.
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/115408370-M.jpg"">
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/115408087-M.jpg"">
and the back
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/115408113-M.jpg"">

it's not over yet though.
i still need to present for 5 min about what i learned for my course project for my retail enviroment class...i am making a lovely power point presentation though...but my teacher leaves the lights on pretty much for it...lame.
i hate public speaking,so much...so much that when i registered for classes today i forced myself to take effective speaking next quarter so i will no longer have this fear.

i know this is a lot about school.
but school has seriously taken over my life.

im looking forward to the next 3 weeks i have off.
im looking forward to relaxing
but im also looking forward to returning and being a busy....bee?? again.

so yeah.
theres an update.
i still need to do some christmas shopping.
i am spending christmas with justins family.
we went back to sacramento for thanksgiving.
i am getting my hair dyed this sunday i hope.
a fun fact (for me) when i started this lj i weighed 128 lbs i now weigh 110.
i got a new credit card and had to call all my auto pay places to tell them this morning which took...1hr 30 min. stupid wait times.
hmm..
my baby titus is still good.
justin and i feed two stray kittens.
there was 3...but he passed away...so i promised the ""spirit of meepee(thekittywhopassed) i would feed his brothers.
cuz they use to be to shy to come near us, but now they do...they even let us pet them. :)

im excited for christmas.
i love the smell of it soooo much."

i hope that worked.
it doesn't come though till Nov 10th.

i feel myself growing up.
i like it, yes. 
i do not like it, yes.

remember when people would say ""enjoy your childhood, it goes by so fast?""
well, here I am an adult.
my childhood days are no longer here.

my peers are married.
my peers have children.
my peers have careers.
some of my friends, have these as well.

i love a lot of parts of my life.

but.

i'm also really unsure about a lot of other parts of my life.
and i know i'm not ready to be 100% sure.

its just frusterating, wanting answers knowing fully well you cant get the answer because it simply isnt time for the answer to be...well answered.

TIME.
it 
always
comes
down
to
time.

i'm going in circles.
i'm waiting for the Jimmy Eat World ""the middle"" song not to apply to me anymore.

i just want to feel more secure.
i want to know, i'm not doomed.
as crazy as that sounds.
i just want to know, i will survive growing up and come out of this as a stable, adjusted, caring and loving person just living my life doing the things i enjoy and sharing my life with really wonderful people all the while knowing, i did it. I grew up.

whats the next stage after growing up?
im afraid to ask.

who knows.
this stage probably doesnt ever end.
considering, we are always growing.
i just want the day to come, where I am comfortable with myself.
thats the time...i'm waiting for.
thats my next part in growing up.

i'm not in the beginning of it.
and i'm not nearly at the end.
yet again.
i'm in the middle.

i feel like im finally taking my first steps.
yet....i feel like im doing it as an orphan.
pretty much alone.

there arent that many changes coming into my life.
but those that are...are pretty HUGE.

my parents divorcing after 28 years of marriage.
wow. hi? umm.....i have no fucking clue what to say about that really i dont.
i wish i did, so i could get on the process of dealing with it.
but im fucking speechless.
mindless.
i tend to forget about it, because i dont live w/ them anymore.
but i know when i go to visit it will be different.
but more so than that.
I know my mom and dads lives are going to be different.
My mom......i cant imagine her not w/ my dad even if they didnt have the best relationship.
and My dad....theres no way in hell he can survive w/o my mom.
he'll learn that, and i hope hope hope hope to god my mom wont ever take him back after this.

they put the house up on market last week.
the house I lived in for fucking 18 years.
the only house ive ever had.
next time I go to visit.
it wont be there.
some other family will be living there.
thats so mind boggling.

also...
school.
I'm going to FIDM.
I hear good things and bad things about it.
I hear you also need a B.A. to make it afterwards.
I hear you don't if you network correctly.
I hear the people are snobby.
I hear everyone is fake.
I hear there are nice people there.
I hear its a realllly hard school.
I hear its crap after you graduate, you may never get a good job.
I hear you can become successful.
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE
i'm investing $20,000 to this.
and here I am unsure.
I know this is what i want to do w/ my life.
but i'm unsure of the school will take me to the places i need to get.

and growing up.
i dont really like it.
i really miss being little, and not being so afraid of everything.
not caring what other people thought about me.
not feeling fatter than the girl next to me.
not feeling ugly.
i loved waking up and watching cartoons.
i loved going to feed ducks w/ my gma.
i loved swimming (god, i loved swimming, its all i would do every summer)
i miss not having to work on myself.
not having to make myself better constantly.
a better person.
a better daughter.
a better girlfriend.
a better friend.
its so overwhelming.
and i know, no one is really asking me to any of these, except me.
but I cant help it.
I constantly feel like I'm not good enough.
I'm not pretty enough.
I'm not skinny enough.
I'm not smart enough.
I'm not talented enough.
and its not that I dont believe in myself, because I do.
I've accomplished things that I'm very proud of.
but, its never enough.
yeah....goes w/ the flow doesnt.
when will it be enough for me?
when can i relax?
I DONT KNOW HOW!
my mind is always planning, always wondering, always worrying, always figuring out the next move.
and it seems to be getting worse as I get older.
it needs to stop.
i cant allow myself do that anymore.

its become a big habit.
and its time for me to quit this habit.

people dont know this.
or maybe they do, but we dont discuss it.
but I feel so alone.
I know I have a boyfriend who I see almost everyday.
I know I have friends out here.
but...i need more titus's (my kitty) in my life.
but human titus's.
hah.
i just imagined my cat as a human.
now i'm scared.
i just want friendship to come easy.
with no drama.
no jealousy.
no negative side effects.
i want the best for them, and vice versa.

so yeah basically.
i'm unbalanced.
mentally, physically and emotionally.
not so much spiritually.
i want balance.
and it brings me back me physically having no balance.
i wonder if that plays into my mentally/emotionally not having any.
doctors told my parents ""I'd never be a ballarina"" (i didnt learn to walk till I was 3ish, cuz of balance issues)
i want to turn that around.
i hear stories about doctors saying so and so will never be this, and they become that and the #1 person at that.
i'm not saying I want to become a prima ballarina...
or maybe I am.
i just want to connect the dots and form a nice balanced line."

just so I can escape and be relaxed with stressful situations arise.
such as when friends, family, significant others stress you out,or even a random stranger.
but i realized fuck that, I'm better, stronger, more capable than to just give in and take a substance.

This weekend has been such a huge learning lesson for me.
I wont get into details.
but my friend Melissa texted me with ""Did you learn?"" (because i sent out a mass text about me learning how to ride a bike this weekend, yes i dont know how, i have no balance, and i sadly didnt learn how to still, because of situations that arose)
but her text me made me laugh, because WOW did I learn.
I learned that you need to learn to laugh at situations, even potentially serious ones, need to sometime be dealt with light heartily.
I learned that you can't always make people happy, and its not my job too.
I learned that even my close friends, dont know where I'm coming from sometimes, they have their own ideas, and thats fine and I cant expect them to understand, I can just hope they do.
I learned that I dont need to explain everything all the time or make sure people understand every detail, who cares if so and so doesnt know the exact details of everything in my life.
I learned that it doesnt matter where you are, who matters who you are with.
I learned that even if it doesnt go as planned, you can still have fun.
I learned that even if things are rough for a moment, they dont need to stay that way.
I learned that people are going to jump at me when they dont need to, and it doesnt mean I did anything wrong, its just a miscommunication, and if we want to resolve it we will.
I learned that I need to give people more lee-way(i dunno how to spell it) I need to be more calm with them, more accepting, more understanding, softer even to strangers, I need to listen more and be more accommodating. 
I learned that there are a few people out there who to really care about me.
and its the surprising ones who do.
I learned I need to focus on them more.
I learned I'm still growing up, and figuring out who I want to become.
I may be more aware, but I'm still ""in the middle"". (jimmyeatworldesque)
I am learning being happy isnt so bad afterall.
and I'm still learning how to not worry so much,
but It will come, and it already is, but like i said i'm in the middle still and i'm okay with that.


so yeah, like I said this was a big learning lesson weekend for me.
and I plan to take all I learned and use it when ever necessary.

I didnt have internet for 2 days. boo.
and i chipped my back tooth while eating a yummy sandwich, and its painful.
I went to the dentist today sat there for 2 hours for nothing, except x rays and to tell me to come back on wednesday.
oh well soft foods again till then.

I'm so happy the weather as cooled down.
I'm so happy that my boyfriend still surprises me with sweet things (a napkin flower)
I'm so happy that i have this cute orange cat who cuddles with me on a daily basis.
I'm so happy i got into FIDM.
I'm so happy its almost my birthday.
I'm so happy i fit into a size 3 the other day and it was semi lose and instead of being a 28/29 I'm now a s 26/27.
I'm so happy i have the internet again.
I'm so happy i had people over my apartment this weekend, even though my bathroom and apartment were a HUGE mess, people still had FUN, come back again soon K, i cleaned today :) its sparkling, except for the dishes.
hah."

@12:30ish i find out a big part of my FUTURE.
today is FIDM interview day. (the last interview)
i had pink eye last thursday, so my interview got postponed.
and now i'm still sick and kind of dont have a voice, but I dont care, I'm going in there and presenting my project I worked my ASS off on. I love it. I LOVE IT. and regardless of what happens I know I did my very best.

I also got a job at at American Eagle.
so yay for a second job.
this job is so i can get my foot in the door for my career.
my first job is so i can survive and make ends meet.
come October, if i do get into FIDM it will be my priority.
and we will see if I can keep up the 2 jobs and school.

anyways.
just wanted to share.

Oh and this is how i got the job at American Eagle.

I go in to try some clothes, i see two workers saying something about how someone vomitted on the clothes while trying it on and i say ""oh, and i was just going to ask if i could work here"" and the girl goes ""YES, if you want to sort through vomitted on clothes with us"" and she sends me over to the hire manager, and he gives me an application, I fill it out and while I am he asks if I have 5 min afterwards to talk I say yes. So I go into the back room with him and he ends up interviewing me, usually he does group interviews so it was hard on him LOL, I'M SO GLAD I LUCKED OUT OIN THAT i hate group interviews.
so he interviews me and says he wants to say i'm hired but he wants to check the references first. So I go back out into the store and he asks if I have any questions, I say ""Nope, just wondering if i can shop in here now?"" and he says ""Yes, please do and when you work here you get 40% off"" and then so I buy some things and while in line this girl that works there, called to help the next customer in line but he wasnt listening so I tapped him on the shoulder and told him and the girl was like ""awh yay, thank you i hope you get the job here"" LOL. so yeah...as I was walking out the hire manager told me he was calling my references and i said ""okay tell them i say Hi"" LOL and then i got home listened to my answer machine and he offered me the job.
I start wednesday.

so yeah.

I had a nice weekend.
Justin and I went to the beach and saw lightning, and tried to win a stuffed animal on a water game thingie.
and yeah, I finished up my project for FIDM and im good to go.

yet looks like its going to pour.
its very conflicting.
i half want hot chocolate half want to go to the ocean.
i guess i can have both.
i dont want to go alone though.
everyones so busy with their own lives.
i have my boyfriend.
but everyone else seems so hard to reach, make plans with, get ahold of.

im still doing the FIDM thing.
i have part 1 of my essay done and the beginning of part 2 done, im finishing that today.
tomorrow i'm doing the entrance project, and giving out the reference forms to people.
and im almost done studying for the math assessment.
i'm excited and scared about this whole process.
excited about almost everything except scared that i may not get in.

yesterday i got the creepiest note on my car.
it said
""I like your boy (or body, we cant figure it out to be exact) and I like you too and then theres a # and a name that looks like Neil and then says will LU2 or will LV2""

so I call it, and he says his name is Nick, and he doesnt remember what he wrote but he wanted to ask me out, and I said I had a boyfriend and he said he didnt know hes sorry.

and then Justin wanted to call LOL. and he apologized again.
but so CREEPY.
i swear it says i like your boy and you too.

im hungry.
but i cant move my car, cuz its street cleaning day and if i move it, i'll never get parking until after 10 a.m.
and i have no food here except for chicken nuggets.

this entry is getting me no where."

I'm going to ask my Mom, when i go visit if I can take $1500 out of my stock money for this and pay the rest myself.
I'm sure she'll say okay, I need to do this regardless.
especially before i put my heart and soul into FIDM for 2 years straight.
I promised myself when I was 18 I would go to Europe.
did you know being 26 yr olds in europe is still considered youth on the Eurorail :)

I'm hoping Justin can come to Paris, I know he cant get a loooot of time off, but I'm hoping he can atleast do the 3 nights in Paris or even London.

k now its time to study and work :)
i've been doing this almost all day and yesterday."

"event","so low and behold.
i do have dry socket.
i finally got a call from not my oral surgeon but his assistant.
he had me come in, he tried cleaning out my hole (LOL) and it hurt.
but the other side didnt really hurt.
which led him to beleive i had dry socket.
people talk about how its insanely painful...umm its annoying and it hurts.....but its not life altering.
anyways...he packed it with clove stuff and medication and the pain went away.
it still sucks.
it delays the healing process.
dry socket can last anywhere from 5 days to a little over a month.
(everyone hope,pray,wish it lasts 5 days LOL)
i have to go back AGAIN on monday to have him remove the packing and maybe have him pack it again *sigh*
oh well, i'll eventually get better.
When Justin gets off work, we're going to go to a homeopathic store and go get some meds I heard that are good for healing.
can't hurt.
and they're not to expensive.
i'm also going to buy some clove oil, i hear it works wonders too.

im glad i finally am getting treated.
i just hope it doesnt last for a long time.

k this is hopefully the end of me updating about my teeth.
i'm so sick of it.
LOL.

OH funny story.
since I couldn't get ahold of my oral surgeon...i found some online LOL.
on Yahoo member dictory.
they helped me a lot.
and told me that even though I have a cavity, it cant do anything to the extraction site, but i should get it filled when the dry socket is gone."

"event","so.
scratch the me feeling better.
i feel better in all areas, except my bottom RIGHT tooth.
its still throbbing, has some weird taste coming from it,my ear hurts and it just plain hurts.

i tried calling my oral surgeon again.
but i cant get ahold of him.

it may be dry socket?
it may be an infection of the jaw/bone.
it may be nothing and its just having trouble healing.

im just so overly frusterated.
atleast all my other extraction areas feel better.
i have a cavity, right by the lower right extraction site, i wonder if thats causing it some problems????? 
i want my oral surgeon to fix me and fix me now and for forever.
but this pain is driving me mad, i'm so unhappy, so bitter and i havent done anything fun in the past 10 days.
its taking a toll on me and those close to me (ie my boyfriend) 
i dunno how much longer i can go on with this stupid pain in my mouth.
it hurts it hurts it hurts.
fuck i know better than this.
i learned how to make pain go away, yet i revert back to my baby ways.
why?
i dunno.

all i want right now is to be in bed next to my boyfriend curling up on his chest.

instead im at home in pain on lj.
im crying now.
thats awesome."

so.
i have a rash on my face now.
its due to the stress.
i look sunburnt.
i get them when i get really exhausted/stressed/overwhelmed.

it brings more color to my face though.

what a night.
what a morning.
what an afternoon.

i go to my car to go to the dentist (obviously)
and see flowers on window wipers, from of course justin <3.

I get to the dentists office.
He said the bleeding can happen, i cant remember why he said so...i just remember him saying ""it looks good"" he told me that my lip went numb because teabags are medicated with a numbing agent and thats why, and it probably hit my nerve since the hole is so deep. 

the feeling is all back now though.

so...it just hurts.
then my dentist gave me my ""new bestfriend"" as he says. 
to clean the holes out with.

and then I call my Mom.
and she tells me, her and my Dad are getting divorce.
now this is not shocking to me.
ive told my mom since i grew common sense that my dad is not a good husband.
he has cheated on her many times in the past, he has disrespected her many times in the past.

My mom wants to live in peace.
her and my dad get along better nowadays, but she knows its the right thing to do in her head and also in her heart.
she is sad but also excited to not come home and worry about what kind of mood my dad will be in, or if he will abuse her.

I support my Mom.
its still sinking in...so im kinda ""numb"" and not sure what to say.
They've been unhappily married for as long as I can remember.
marriage shouldnt be what they have made it.
so I am okay with it.
about 85%.
its still weird....knowing one day I'll go home to visit and I'll have to see my Dad one day and my Mom another.

i kinda...just want smoothness for a few weeks after all this.
nice. calm. smoothness.
and smoothies.
the dentist said since my case is kinda severe i'll be all better in 6 weeks."

"event","last night, my mouth started bleeding...not just a little but a lot..., i was finally feeling better, and then BOOM, my lower right tooth area starts bleeding.

I freak out.

I put guaze on it for a bit??? (i dunno what to do, i never heard of bleeding on day 6)

then I talked to my friend kyle, who was concerned and tried to be a detective to find stuff to do, and he told me to bite down on a moist tea bag, and so I did....cuz i read that before too...

so...I do and seconds later, my lip is NUMB!!!


now im really freaking out, Justin is on his way over....

and I call my oral surgoens emergency line....but get his VM.

k someone tell me the point in having an emergency line....when its not avail.

true it was like 12 a.m....but still???

i dunno....i freaked out a lot. 

its just this was my big fear going into this surgery....numbness....

I like feeling my lips, and my tounge and my cheek.

and...im happy to say most of the feeling is back...its just all tingly...and weeiird.

Justin thinks i overstimulated the nerve with the teabag....

who knows?

my oral surgeon still hasnt called back, and his office is already open....i'm going to call, but its still dissapointing he hasnt called yet.

the only thing that bothers me now is, the PAIN in my lower right tooth area.

I'm just READY to be BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!

i like being HEALTHY. those of you who know me, know how important health is to me.

I feel like i'm being sucked down...some downward health spiral (these past 4 weeks have not been fun on my health)...but I'm smarter than that, and I know I have control....but ""its hard to have control when you are losing your nerves"" (literally)

but my nerves are coming back....so i will regain control....and i will get better.

i just wish it was now....



i called the dentist office at 8:30 and they told me to come in right away.
so off I go...
wish me luck."

"event","i'm so excited, yet so overwhelmed.

mainly about this school.
i've never made anything such a priority before.
it feels like a new obessesion.
if you have been around me lately you'll notice, all i talk about is FIDM, FIDM and FIDM.
and I still dont even know if they will accept me. LOL.
or if i will get enough for student loans.

On top of writing an essay, and getting 3 letters of recommendation, i also have to do an entrance project, this is my entrance project http://fidm.com/admissions/application/entrance-projects/merchandise-marketing.html if I do good on it and on my essay, I will get in. Hi Pressure, Hi Overwhelment.

I have a plan though, I want to have a store sorta like anthropologie, I love that store. you can view the online one here http://www.anthropologie.com.
So when I talk about the store, instead of doing magazine cut outs like it states, I kind of want to be different and take pictures of real women (to let them know I'm interested in selling to real women), like I'll ask for their permission and let them know what its for, but when I see a girl with a style I like, I will snap her photograph, and I will also cut out pictures of actual clothing, but no models and stuff. I also want to bring in a candle and show what the store will smell like, I want to make it real to them and real to me.

I have some questions about my entrance project like...
values and viewpoints, and marital status???
but i'll ask on my second interview.

I'm so excited, that I'm sad?
does that make any sense.
because I want to get it all done now now now.
and I simply cant.
I need to see the beauty in patience, and letting things flow in a good manner.
I cant rush this, I cant make it happen in one night, I cant neglect those close to me.
I need to find a balance.

now I need to go to PCC (my school as of now) and go learn about eastern religions.
im not motivated to do that anymore...but i will finish this semester.
yes, yes I will."

life is good :)

i have another cold though.
seriously this season hates me.
but its not so bad.

i dunno where to start writing.

hmm...
well I'm getting ready to transfer schools, and the school I'm most likely transferring to is FIDM http://www.fidm.edu/  I had an interview with them on Friday. I really like the school, and what it has to offer, except for the fact I'm going to owe my life to student loans. I want to become a retail buyer. I have for some time. FIDM is one of the best fashion marketing schools out there for it. My interview went well, I have a second interview on the 17th, where I will apply for student loans and also get the application process started, I need to write an essay, bring my transcripts from highschool/college (the part that im worried about, but they assured me if I write a good essay that explains myself, I'll most likely be accepted) I also need to get 3 letters of recommedation. The school is beautiful.
<img src=""http://www.fidm.edu/about/campuses/los-angeles/design-studio/images/design_lab_1a.jpg""> thats the computer lab.
<img src=""http://www.fidm.com/about/campuses/los-angeles/design-studio/images/design_lab_6a.jpg""> more of the computer lab.

there are more photos on the website. 

so yeah.
so now, im considering the school, instead of them considering me, Its such an investment, I wonder what the ratio is on to people who actually become what they want when they get their degree. 
I want to eventually become a senior fashion buyer. 
I need to start first though with working in retail for 2 years or so part time, during that time I'll earn my degree and when I'm out FIDM will place me as an assistant buyer/junior buyer with a senior buyer if my grades are well. Then after I work as that for a few years, I can become a senior buyer they make between 70,000-85,000 a year, and they get to travel all over the world. 

my goal, as some of you know is to one day own my own boutique and buy clothes for it. simple huh? just here I am finally at the beginning of my career.

These are the classes I need to take.
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/63819223-M.jpg""> 

so its a 2 year program.
I would start in July (yes this July)
I take 5 classes a quarter.
each class is 3 hours long.
so basically, I only go to school twice a week.
I'm going to try and go only on Mon and Tues
Mon 8:30-6
and Tues from 8:30-3
but the rest of the week I'll still be there probably working on projects or what not.



i'm excited! 

so on to my weekend.
i didn't really do anything to exciting but it was still a really sweet/amazing/nice weekend.

On saturday I woke up to a really sweet video text message from Justin, it was him pretending i was in bed next to him telling me to wake up and saying cute things, I'd share it but it's to sweet to share LOL.

but I will share this one its called Chicken Nugget Love - <a href='http://media.putfile.com/032806_1333'> WATCH ME!!! </a> he sent this one to me on one of his lunch breaks

So saturday I worked a bit in the morning and then Justins sister was having a bday bbq, so Justin and I went, I watched him play croquet, it was funny, and I also ate some really good cookies, and had a converstation with a guy from London who wants to move out here to go to law school, after that, Justin and I went to go eat dinner and there was this drunken girl there who looked 15 with a 40 yr old man, and Justin and I decided to play dectectives and follow them around the city. It was hilarious, when the girl went to the bathroom, I was in there, and I could hear her puking it was awful, and then when they got up to leave Justin and I did too, but they went back in, and we just like stood around, and then we just followed them until they went into a sex shop. 

Then the night was filled with tissues and cold medicine.

On Sunday morning we layed around in bed and then we decided to make pancakes, Justin has never made pancakes before, and so he wanted to do it all on his own, so while he was making pancakes and various other things, I decided to be a good girlfriend and clean his room and bathroom.
It was cute, he didnt want me to do anything because I'm sick, but I just couldnt sit around.
so...yeah he made the most awesome pancakes and eggs. I'm proud of him. 
and then we took a nap for about an hour, and then I went home to rest and he went rock climbing.
when I say rest, I mean I went to Nordstroms and bought clothes LOL.
It makes me feel better when I'm sick, hence why I should be a buyer, and whenever i buy things for people they usually really like my gifts/suggestions.

so yeah after that, we went to Michaels (the craft store) to go find backings for disney pins, (Justins dad works for disney and Justin use to collect disney pins) because we sold some on ebay, but didnt have any backings for the pins, but Michaels didnt have any, so we had this crazy idea to go to Disneyland to buy some!!!. 

Justin told me his dad has some free passes laying around for us!!!
so we call Disneyland, and they are on spring break hours which means they close at midnight but it was already 6:30 p.m. hahaha, so we go to Justins parents house and get the passes, but then Justins dad also says he has backings we can borrow and we can go to disneyland another day, maybe when I'm not sick, so we my plan was to flip a coin, it said we should still go, but then Justins dad made a good point and said we're smarter than a quarter we can decide, so on Justins next day off we're going to go to disneyland and we used some of his Dads disneypin backings.

Then we went to dinner at this really yummy mexican resturant.
and then we came back to my apt hung out and had fun.

Then it was another night of tissues and cold medicine.
but I got to wake up to a ""hey you're beautiful, just want you to know that"" so that was nice.

And even though i'm sick right now, I'm still going to the gym tonight for 30 minutes. 
I feel so lazy. 
I need to do something active.

so yeah.
now i need to go to the laudrymat and study.
go to classes
and then work
and then run 2 miles."

in relationships.
its like i dont learn from my mistakes.
im aware of them.
i just...cant seem to let them go.
i know its not my boyfriend.
because i heard prior ones say the exact same things to me.
""im not the guy for you, i cant make you happy""
its like its NEVER ENOUGH for me.
i always want more.
i dont want to be that girl anymore.
Justin handles me well.
better than anyone else ever has.
hes seriously the best boyfriend ive ever had.
he sees things, and actually tries to help.
he tells me constantly, he isnt out to get me, he's here to make my life better.
and....for the most part him and I are...amazing.
its just sometimes, I go crazy.
crazy insecure.
crazy control freak.
crazy nothing you say, can fix it yet i still expect you too, even though its not your problem, its mine.
i get lost and stuck into it.
i cant seem to let it go...and have it rest...i want to keep discussing it over and over.
like i said above, its never enough for me.
and then, I get striked with...(and not just by him, by previous exes) ""rachel, i cant do this anymore, i cant continue these arguments, they cant go to this extreme anymore, you need to realize i understand how you feel, and im sorry and ill try better"" or something along those lines.
and then, when they get seriously frusterated because that still isnt enough for me.
NOTHING is at that moment.
and when they get crazy frusterated cuz they are tired of trying, but only when they HIT crazy frusterated last resort way extreme talk, it somehow brings me back into reality.
its like a fucking fix for me?
but its not, because i dont crave it, i fucking hate it.
i realize how silly I was being, once they hit all they can handle.
i realize how crazy i must have been.
an argument over snoring???
that escalates into me feeling unloved cuz he wont roll over or rub my back because he already tried that or because that still wont be enough and ill want more and ill just continue to be angry, even though all day that day he tried everything he could to make me feel better (i'm sick), and he gets upset cuz he feels that all that stuff he did all day (call me to tell me to drink tea, send me texts about feeling better, sending me flowers on my phone while hes at work, making me tea, buying me tissues and cough med, telling me i'll feel better soon, kissing my forehead) didnt matter, because now since he wont roll over or rub my back, i think he doesnt love me anymore.
when did i become so CRAZY.
i know im not alone, i know girls have trouble letting go of things, but i do it in such a way where its unnecessary.
and i know im aware of how bad it is.
but when i get stuck in one of my ""crazy"" times. I cant escape it.
until, it goes to the extreme
and then i, seem to come back down to ""normal"".
i tell myself after one of these episodes happens, i wont do it anymore.
but low and behold it happens time and time again.
it needs to stop.
i dont want it anymore.
i love my boyfriend, and dont want to lose him.
and he doesnt want to lose me.
my last relationship fucked me up just a tad, yes chaz was a wonderful guy, but i learned in hindsight that before him, I was atleast more free spirted, with chaz I always had to plan when i'd get to see him, and now I do that with justin, even though I had to do that with chaz, cuz he was all about we can only see eachother on such and such day, i dont NEED to that with justin. justin makes it very clear to me, he's my boyfriend, he wants to see his girlfriend , but it doesnt quite click in my head, i'll still plan things, just incase he snaps and decides he wants do the such and such a day thing.
or...
chaz never let me meet his co workers.
and....tonight is justins last night at his branch at wells fargo, and he may be going out with his co workers.
and here I am panicked he wont want me to be there, so i panic this morning going, I want to go???!!!!
and he goes, of course, i want you there, if you want to be there?
im just so AWARE of how crazy i am, but not at that time its happening.
i kinda do, but it doesnt matter at that time, because at that time all i want is to feel better, and i feel talking/discussing will make it better, but it makes it worse...it makes it worse because nothing they say will make it better and nothing i say will either.
when will i learn that? 
all i can say is next time, whatever time, from now on...i'm going to be the girl i want, even if it goes aganist what im use to, because its time to let go of the games....and time to let go of that ""crazy, insecure, only believes the worst"" girl.its time to let go of thinking boys are evil and want to hurt you. its time to <b>believe in myself</b>, and believe i am good enough, and believe my boyfriend loves me.

its finally time for the next step.
to grow up.
like so many have said to me before.
i admit to my faults.
and i only have one way to go from this point on, and thats to be the girl, i know i can be and want to be.
and not the insecure girl i once was."

"event","so.

the food poisioning is over with.
sadly.
we both got it.
justin got it on tues afternoon.
it was, awful and adorable all in one.
Justin made my moms version of homemade soup.
he did a good job.
we lived off mashed potatoes and popsicles.
and drank so much water and watched so many movies.
and slept so much.
and kept telling eachother we're gunna be okay, and how we are kinda happy we are going through this together.

on the day Justin got sick, i started to feel a little better.
atleast i thought.
so I ventured out to go get movies.
well, I threw up inside blockbuster.
the lady was taking so long with the customers infront of me and I couldnt wait anymore.
I asked if their bathroom was working, they said its out of order.
so...I thought i could hold it back.
I had to cough, and with that cough.
I vomited.

cute huh?

I came back to the apt.
and we rested and vomited more.
and rinse and repeat.
I decided to take a shower, and Justin heard a hug THUMP and that maybe i fell down, so he ran upstairs to see if I was okay, and I was, but I guess he ran to fast and as soon as he found out i was okay, he then realized he shouldnt have ran upstairs cuz then he had to go run downstairs to go vomit.

yeah that was basically how it went.

but then come thursday morning.
we decided we're going to go.
we're going to do this.
yay BIG BEAR!

the drive was okay, i felt a little woozy on the turny roads.
but we made it.

and the cabin was nice.
but as soon as we walk in, I see Sara with a broken wrist :(
she hurt it snowboarding.
poor girl.

so, we walk in and we see everybody (sara, adam, stacy, alexis, mike, another rachel, and jason)
and everyones just chilling around the dinner table.
and we just hang out.
the boys go for a walk.
and the girls had make up time LOL.
sara did my make up while on vicodin but she did a good job.

and I played the card came speed, I beat everyone I played except for Adam.

and then later that night, i decided to drink.
which was fun.

I heard on the first two nights everyone was there, it was some drama and crazyness.
I'm kinda glad i missed that.

the last night was mellow.
Justin and I got this awful bed.
we called it the diaper bed.
cuz everytime we moved it felt like a diaper.
but...we managed it make it work :)

I had fun being drunk buddies with Stacy.
I didnt drink that much, just two shots and then sips of this awful drink i made.
we took photos.
(ill add them at the bottom)

even though, we were only there for a night.
and didnt go snowboarding, or do much stuff in the snow.
it was really fun.
Sara made an awesome dinner with her broken wrist.
and then we went to breakfast in the morning.
to my favorite ghetto resturant in big bear.
and then we all went our seperate ways.

Justin and I stayed for a bit and looked at the shops.
not to exciting.
so we left.
we were going to go tubing.
but we didnt want to be wet the whole way home.
so we drove back.
and came home and took the longest nap ever.
and then went back to my apt, to check on my baby Titus.
and hung out for a bit.
and then went and ate dinner, and came back to the apt and took a shower.
and then hung out with Adam and sara for a little bit, they got tired.
I was wired from my nap, so Justin and i stayed up and watched southpark.
and then went to sleep.

i cant explain it, and i wont try.
i wish i could share it with everyone.
but im really fucking lucky.
i have awesome friends.
and a really amazing boyfriend.
we have our moments when things arent perfect.(friends and the boyfriend)
but it all comes together.


even being sick, with kind of fun.
how fucking weird is that?
but its because I have these awesome people in my life.
and Justin, who took care of me like crazy and even though I was half dead still managed to make me laugh.
kissing when you're partially dehyrdated was kind of fun too.
and hearing him tell me how beautiful he thinks I am even when I'm sick.
and him staying with me an extra day to wait for big bear, even though he got sick at the end of the day.
makes me feel so lucky and special.



so yeah.
here are some photos btw.

<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/54198281-M.jpg"">

thats sara with the cast, stacy, me behind stacy, alexis and then other rachel.

"event","so boo.
i have some sort of the stomach flu.
it was so bad yesterday, i was dry heaving and had some blood loss.
it was justins bday and where did he spend it, in the e.r. with me.
i felt/feel guilty.
but he is really understanding.

im feeling better today.
but still nothing wants to stay in my body :(
and tomorrow is the big bear trip.

justin and i discussed it, and him and I are most likely going to go up a day late, or if i decide not to go at all he will go up there a day late, he is really sweet and wants to make sure im okay.
but yet again i feel guilty. i dont want to hold him back from having fun.

today was just a lot of resting on a futon or on a bed.
and having popsicles, toast, and chicken broth.
and hanging out with Justin and him basically taking care of me.
i feel really lucky.

then towards the end of the day.
sara and adam came ""home"" (adam and justins house)
and we all hung out for a bit, i ran to the bathroom a lot :/
and now here I am at 11:45 p.m. ready to go to sleep.
i hope tomorrow i feeeeel a lot better.
i really want to go and snowboard.

im tired.
i need sleep.
bye."

i dunno if thats the day quil.
i have a small cold.

anyways.

im really proud of myself GUYS!
ive been going rock climbing twice a week.
or once.
but atleast once a week for a month now.

and today Justin and I were suppose to go on a snowboard shopping extravangaza cuz we plus like 14 other people are going to Big Bear on the 24th to the 27th, and we have no stuff.

so we go to R.E.I. and we see nothing there, but then we go over to the rock climbing area and I see these really awesome rock climbing shoes, but they are a little pricey...but Justin wanted to buy me a little chalk bag for when i climb and then i saw shoes that matched and I tried them on and I looooved them, and my best boyfriend ever bought them for me. 

so anyways....we leave and they opened or should i say re opened the indoor rock climbing gym right by REI and i wanted to try out my new shoes, and well Justin always wants to climb.

so we go :)
and I climbed...and I was sore cuz I went yesterday at the gym.
and my shoes are painful (they are suppose to be a little umcomfortable...like youre a ballerina)
and I'm scared of rock climbing gym cuz youre not on a rope so you either climb back down or jump down.
while at the gym gym...you are on a rope...so you just hop back down.

so I was practicing going up and trying to climb down before I went to the top.
and Justin helped a lot.

so I went almost to the top, and tried climbing back down...and slipped and totally fell Justin tried to catch me but it didnt work and, I'm okay except i hurt my knee. 

its so much FUN, but so SCARY.

so after I did my falling scene, and panicked for a bit i decided to try again, but my shoes were really starting to hurt, so I didnt so much after that.

but....
we are going back again TONIGHT!
he has do his taxes and stuff.
and after that if theres more time we are going back.

i know right.
i really enjoy it.
i suck but i cant wait to learn and get better.

and watching Justin is really fun, cuz he makes it look really easy.


so then we finally went and got snowboarding stuff.
all at one store with an awesome sale.
so YAY!

i also got my hair dyed.
and its weird.
it is brown and blonde and has like 4 bright red highlights.
it looks pointless.
i cant wait to change it.
i hate it.
i think im going to try on Monday to change it.

i hope I can.
just the highlights.

anyways.
i need to go eat and clean up my apt.
but thats the update.


oooooh. as for my last lj entry about the thing with my friend sara and I.
we did a lot of talking.
and theres a lot i can type, but basically

1. we love eachother.
2. we talked about how we felt about things.
3. we are going to try and be more supportive of what the other wants.
4. she is a really amazing friend.

theres a lot i can write on the subject.
things arent perfect.
and im not sure if they ever will be.
but perfect or not, i want her in my life.

update : on saturday i can get these stupid red highlights from my hair removed.
yay for alice!!!! she even said for free, and she didnt even do them.
she loves me.

yay cuz sat night is my friend simones bday dinner and stuff and my hair wont look like crap.

these are the stupid red highlights.
i asked for purplish brown and a gold highlights with a med/dark brown base.

and i got this :

<lj-cut text=""the pictures and a realllly long story"">

so Justin and I decided to go feed ducks in the ghetto.

here they are.
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779408-M.jpg"">
they look so god sent.

we put bread on the back of a duck to try and see him get it (he was mean to the other ducks)
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779415-M.jpg"">

little did he know his friend was going to snatch it
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779412-M.jpg"">

he looks at us afterwards sad so we give him a piece of bread
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779419-M.jpg"">

then we drove to the beach
and justin doesnt like the ocean water.
but he put his feet in there for me.
because its my favorite.

and then we took a few photos.
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779426-M.jpg"">
his lips look non existent while mine look huge.
(hes a good kisser i swear, i just didnt take the photo at the right time)
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779422-M.jpg""> i was sleepy.

then we drove back to his apt, and i took 2 silly photos of him.
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779433-M.jpg"">
and i tried to make this one artsy
<img src=""http://rachrachrach.smugmug.com/photos/51779405-M.jpg"">

so yeah.


right now, im in a confused mood.
not over a boy.
but over a friend.
my friend sara.

lately her and I.
i dont know......are so far apart now.
I dont blame her.
I dont blame me.
I blame us.

my side of the story is understandable and so is hers.
and it doesnt even matter.
i just want things to get better.

i never had a friend like her.
she is such a caring and amazing friend.
and at the same time.
she expects a lot a lot a looooot from me.
and I can understand that...but at the same time....she cant get mad at me when im not up to par.

she says I dont make an effort, and she even understands why (because i feel it wont matter)
she basically thinks.
I'm all about Justin.
and...well...I am a lot about him, but not nearly as much as she thinks.

I remmeber her and I use to have mondays for us.
ive been willing the last few mondays (not including the holiday mondays)
but she has had plans.
or she was angry with me.
or something came up.
we try and reschedule but our schedules dont work.

and today i tried.
but she was busy, but i also understand why i wasnt invited because we need to talk alone before we hang out with friends together.

so saturday we are going to have brunch and talk.
im going to put my heart into it.
and really listen to her.

we had one good day a few weeks ago.
we just went xmas shopping and hanging out.
and i wish i could have days like that back with her.

i dont even know the problem.
except things have changed in our lives.
she is kinda dating justins bestfriend/roommate adam
so we see eachother a lot, but dont really get sara and rachel time.

she says, i dont make an effort to hang out with her and adam or invite them places with justin and i .
and its not that I dont want to, its just i figure they are already busy, because they arent at the apartment.
if they were there, of course id invite them.
and we discussed that, and I invite her to things more or what not.
its not that we really do that many things also.
Justin gets off work at like 8 and by then all we do is eat?
and sara has already aten by then.
is aten a word?

anyways.
I remember like we went and ate without them and sara was upset, so then we invited them out to coffee and they said sure, but they never showed up...and i was a little upset but if the tables were turned I know sara would have been really angry. we didnt even get a phone call.

I just dont want to upset her anymore.
but i wish she didnt get upset so easily.

on sunday.
we all went out to eat, and she was telling a story, and while she was talking, I interuppted her and started talking to Justin and she was realllllly upset. and I can understand that. but for some reason I didnt realize she was talking.

so I went to the bathroom and she came to, and told me ""Im really mad at you btw, for interuppting me"" and in my head i'm like oh god shes mad at me again (because last weekend she was upset with me too and then the following week to, i cant even remember why, she wasnt even sure why I think). 

so I told her I didnt realize she was talking....and she goes oh thanks....thanks...
and she said ""you dont make an effort, when im with you two i feel like im just hanging out with people who i dont know, who are in ther own world""

she says I dont talk to the group.
I just talk to justin.

but i feel like i do TALK!
to her and adam and other people.

I remmeber at the little xmas gathering we had.
I barely talked to Justin all night.
I was with sara and shanda the whole night basically.

and then she blamed me for things, i didnt think were true.
like me getting mad at her for going to ikea without me, when her and adam went.
I wasnt upset at all?

and i just couldnt handle it so i walked away.
so i walk back to the table with where our boyfriends are, and pay and leave  (sara is kinda dating adam, but its easier to say boyfriends) and we are in the car and adam says ""can you take us back to the apt, we are going to take two diff cars to the car show""

and so we drop them off.
and justin looks at me all confused.
and i tell him what just happened in the bathroom.
and hes really sincere and cute about it.

but yeah....

i just feel like all the effort i do put in doesnt matter, because eventually ill fuck up.
and i get it now, because i do that exact thing to every boyfriend i ever had.

so maybe this is a life lesson.
for me.

to 1. become a better listner 
and 2. be more open minded and realize they arent doing it on purpose.

things for the past few months have been off and on with sara and I.
and i fucking hate it.
one day its good, few days its bad one day its great.
rinse and repeat.

I dont see why its so complicated.
I love her, I want her to be happy.
I want her to realize, I want to see her more often or...I want to see her and other people that arent our boyfriends.
I want her to realize i know i havent been a good listener and I'm working on it.
I want her to realize, im jealous of her and how she has so many friends and how outgoing she is.
I want her to realize, I think she is an amazing friend and I owe so much to her.
I want her to realize, that I'm not trying to be a bad friend, and I know she isnt either.
I want us to realize how to fix whatever it all is.
I want us to be seerah and rachel again.
not everyday.
but very fucking often.


i hope all the above is realized soon.
i guess thats all."

"event","its been such a long time since i gave an actual update.
i think i just shouldnt.

last night, my other cat pigeon (the one who chaz took when we broke up) had to be put down.
she had a mass and she was suffering, and chaz did the right thing.
its really sad and sucky.
she was an awesome cat, she tolerated me well.
she was so sweet.
we got her in July of 2003.
she was homeless basically and looking really frail.
so we took her in and rescued her.
she loved Chaz from the first moment.
she followed him evvverrrywhere he went and always had to sit on his lap or right next to him.
it was really cute and annoying.
she never quite loved me like that, but it was okay.
hah.
she was adorable.
and she will be loved muchly in kitty heaven.

as for my christmas.
it was really good.
I had 3 christmaseseses.

xmas eve I was at saras moms house and ate some really yummy food and got to hang out with sara and co.
and then xmas day I was at Justins parents house allll day.
but it was really fun.
I like his family a lot.
his sisters are so funny.
and his mom is super sweet and his dad is a big cornball.
but its fun.
when we were opening gifts we kept going ""OOOOHH AHHHH""
and his sister kept going ""its a christmas miracle!!!!!""
and it followed along with anything it could, we would say ""OMG its a christmas miraccccllleee""

then we went and saw narnia with his sister and sisters boyfriend.
i liked it for the most part.

then on Monday was christmas with the friends.
and we all opened gifts and then got food.
and then that night people came over.
and we went to shakeys to get pizza.
and played on the xbox 360.
we did mad libs.
it was fun just hanging out.

I got lots of gifts.
especailly blankets!!!
i got 4 this christmas
one from my mom, one from justins mom, one from justin and one from my brother.
I feel blessed :)

I got pretty artwork for my apartment from Sara.
random gifts from Adam, but it was funny because we did similar things for one another.
Justin got me a blanket and my favorite drink without having to mix it, and he wanted to get me something 'special' but he couldnt find it and he wont tell me what it is, cuz he is still going to get it.
Justins mom and dad got me candy and random cute things, like fuzzy socks and pjs and even q tips LOL.
Justins sister made me a scarf, i was like woooooooooooooooooow. I dont think i ever had anyone make me a scarf so its really special to me, and its super pretty.
and his other sister whom I never met got me this awesome hoodie.
i felt a little bad because i didnt plan on getting them gifts really.
I only met one sister once and never the other.

I'm going to get his sister Amanda something soon.
she loves anything pink and red kitchen applicances.
as for his other sister Audra, (who made the scarve), and I kinda last minuted her gift, and I feel awful, but she seemed to like it. I got the info from her myspace on what she likes.
im so 2005 :P

i also got money, and my brother and fiance got me a dvd player and lavendar stuff and i got earrings from saras mom, and just some more things like a kitty calendar with bad cats.

everyone seemed to like the presents i got them.
I got sara a lava lamp.
a really awesome one.
and i got justin a penguin tie (he hearts penguins) its not a cheesy one.
its pinstripe silk and it has a penguin on the bottom like outlined threaded on to it, sara and I got him a penguin alcholol shaker, i got him a chia pet, a gift certificate to his fav deli, and adam, sara and I got him a gym membership for 3 months.
I got justins mom, these really cute heart shaped measuring spoons and justins dad a pen that laughs at him.

so yeah.
theres the update.

im going to miss pigeon.
and all the happiness she brought to chaz, and chaz brought her.
i hope she finds mimi and spud in kitty heaven.
they can all hang out and meow and poop all day in heaven."

it was goooooooood.
I like his family a loooot.
they are so funny and so good natured and im just really comfortable around them.
Justin was scared to ask me to come cuz he thought I was going to say no. lol


now I need to get ready for my other thanksgiving dinner at Saras moms.

Well, it started out with Paulo..we had a really good and, well, very interesting conversation with him...but, who wouldnt, Paulo's Paulo, and I Paulo how he is, very, himself. Then Steven, we didnt say much...Neither did me and Mellisa nor Sam, Um, come to think of it, hardly anone except for my so-called ""friend"" Tiffany, got I hate that bitch. That is exactly what she was being too. But hey, I'm not talking shit, I wouldnt care if she was reading this right now...Yes, Tiff, I called you a B-I-T-C-H. You expected me to buy your little routiene when you call me crying( which is...so fake, just like you). But well, I didn't. Why? BECAUSE, I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU FUCKING SAY! And, you are a horrible friend, you never support me and ANYTHING I do. And you also, never ,ever care about anything I say, shit, I never care about your little fucking problems, but I try to listin and help you. But thats okay, I dont need you, I never did, never will. Your a bitch, not a witch, like you say. You THINK you are, but, your not. YOUR FAKE, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS FAKE!!! Anyway, I'm not spending any more <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=time&v=56"">time</a> on her, its a waste. I also was planning on going to the <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=movies&v=56"">movies</a> but you know, Johnny wouldnt go, and I didn't want to go with anyone else, well, I can't say that, because I did want to go with someone else...anyway.

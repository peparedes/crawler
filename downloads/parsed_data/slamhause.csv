"event","This last week has been unbearable.  I can't sleep at night, I can't focus at work, I'm not hungry at all, and smoking won't help me.  I tried to smoke a cigarette to help ease my mind, but it made me sick beyond belief.  My head was spinning, and I wanted to throw up for a good half hour.  No thank you.

The girl I had fallen for, and moved in with, decided she no longer wanted to be with me, but rather with another guy, Ted, that's been in her life for a long time, and been with her through some tough shit.  I went over to his apartment to hang out, only to find them in bed together.  I was crushed and pissed all at the same time.

I looked forward to coming home everyday to see her, and that she wanted to see me.  Now I come home to an empty apartment, I go to sleep alone, and wake up alone.  Just being here is depressing, but I keep coming back, and everyday I ask myself, why?  Why do I keep coming back?  I still can't answer that question.  I guess I keep hoping it's just a bad dream and that I'll come back and she'll be there.  I honestly don't know.

I still see both of them, him and her, almost everyday.  It's hard to hang around them.  He barely talks to me, and she won't even look at me.  He tells me it's my fault, because I've been so distant.  So it's my fault that he barely talks to me, and that she won't even look at me.  It hurts to think of them going to bed together every night.  It hurts to think of how quickly I was forgotten.

I just had my 21st birthday yesterday.  I went to a bar with a friend of mine, Jason, at midnight.  My first legal beers.  It felt good to hang out with and talk to Jason.  He's a good guy, and listens when I need someone to talk to.  He provides some good input as well.  I feel like I'm pestering him though with how much I wanna talk.  Birthday morning, I go to Jack in the Box to get some food, and I get backed into by an old man.  All he did was shatter the fog lamp, and I felt bad because he was old, so I blew it off.  Later, I went to the DMV to renew my license because it expired that day.  As soon as I got there, the shift linkage broke in the camaro.  The car would come out of drive.  So I had to block the tire, get my temp license, and limp my way back to my buddy Mike's place.  Once there, I bought a new linkage and installed it.  Then I came home, because Kimmie, the girl, had planned a little party for me.  She invited a few friends over to hang out.  So I got here, everyone said happy birthday, and then I got ignored after that, which was my fault as well.  I didn't want to be here and be ignored, so I left, which was a pretty dick thing to do.  I felt like shit for leaving, and they both let me know it too.  So happy fuckin' birthday.

From the beginning, I had this feeling in my gut, that I shouldn't have gotten involved.  My gut told me it was a bad idea, that I was probably going to get hurt, but I let myself anyway.  The last time I dated was in eighth grade, and this is why.  People are cruel, if you open up, if you make yourself vulnerable, you're just going to get hurt.  The safest thing to do is to not let anybody in.  I made myself vulnerable, and I got hurt.  I had no idea it was going to hurt this bad.  I find myself constantly short of breath and pain in my chest.  I want to cry, but can't.

I'm told that I'll get better in time, but it only seems to be getting worse.  If I keep busy, and keep my mind occupied, I'm okay.  As soon as I come back here, it hurts again.  I keep coming back to this same question.  Why do I keep coming back?  Obviously, this place is depressing me.  I need to get away from this place.  I need to get away from them.  That's the only way that I'll be able to heal.  I'm going to look like an asshole for leaving, and not wanting to be around them, but it's tearing me apart.  Can we all still remain friends in time?  Who knows what will happen, but I know I need to get away from this.

I may stay with my buddy Mike for a while.  I'll try and make arrangements with his parents to stay there for a little while.  I don't know how long I will need to heal.  I don't know what to do yet.  I have a job here in Seattle.  If I stay with Mike, the commute wouldn't be too bad.  On the other hand, Ted is moving to Bainbridge Island in the beginning of January, but Kimmie isn't going with him.  She's going to be staying here, in this apartment, with her dog.  She can't afford this apartment by herself.  If I completely leave, I don't know where she would go.  She wouldn't be able to stay in this apartment with her dog.  I don't want to do that to her.  I want her to be able to stay here with her dog.  I don't want her to have to worry about where she's going to be living.  So, we'll both pay for next month's rent, and she can stay here.  She can figure things out for herself as well.  See if this is where she really wants to be.  Maybe I'll come back after a while, and we can continue to be friends, only time will tell.  For now though, I need to find another place to stay.  Right now, it's too hard to see her, to see him, and to stay in this apartment.  Neither of them is going to like me for this, but this is what I need."

"event","So we meet again LJ.  Went to hang out with Mike last night.  He bought a 12-pack of Mike's Hard.  He got the variety pack, with berry, crisp apple, lime, and lemonade.  They were actually pretty good.  I downed like five of 'em, while he's still working on his second.  So after I got drunk, we got the great idea to work on his car and 9:00 at night.  I found working on cars is easier when loaded.  We had what we need to tear apart done in just over an hour.  Ended up staying the night there, shouldn't drive when loaded.

So today, I went to Seattle and hung out with Kimmie.  We watched SLC Punk, good movie.  I had never seen it before.  Then we both went to Everett, where I worked on Mike's car again.  This time we were assembling it.  After all the hours that have been put into that car, I think we've got it done now.  Things are looking up, all eight cylinders were holding compression.  We shall see when it starts if all that time was worth it.

While we were there, Mike and Kimmie got into a 'heated' conversation over politics.  I knew it was gonna happen.  It doesn't take much to get Mike going.  Kimmie seemed to enjoy provoking him. :P  They both had completely different views on politics.  Then, of course, they tried to drag me into the conversation.

After that, we headed back to Seattle.  Jason and Jacob came over as well.  So the five of us hung out.  I played Kimmie a couple of rounds of Super Smash Bros.  I actually beat Kimmie.  I couldn't believe it.  She must have just lost her edge tonight.  While hanging out, I could see that Kimmie and I being close was upsetting Ted.  Then Ted started ignoring Kimmie, which really upset her.  In order to solve this problem, I decided it was best that Kimmie and I went back to just friends.  We may need to have the 'friends' talk. :P

Man not having a cd player in the car really sucks.  That and no heater make for a really lousy drive.  I really need to get my car done.  I think that's enough for tonight LJ.  Later."

"event","Wow.  First journal post.  Very cool.  I've honestly never used one of these before, but what the hell, I'll give it a try.

Went to the dentist today and had three cavities filled.  I need to take better care of my teeth.  The whole left side of my mouth was numb, plus half my tongue.  I chewed on my tongue a little bit, kind of funny feeling.  Could only come up with half a smile too.

My life, up to this point, has been on hold.  I feel like I'm just along for the ride.  I've decided that needs to change.  I don't know where this is going to take me yet.  Wherever I end up, is where I'm meant to be.  Kimmie may move in with me, I don't know yet.  Whatever happens, happens.  I've decided that I'm going to go job hunting this weekend.  I'm gonna look around, throw in a few resumes, and see what comes of it.  I'd prefer to get a job as a mechanic, or computer technician, but construction works just as well.  I may have a job as a longshoreman, but I won't know for sure until the beginning of next month, which is really only a week away.  Even if I get the job, there's no guarantee that I'll have work.

I haven't dated now for about 6 years.  I didn't want to get hurt any more, so I quit dating.  It's been very lonely, but I managed to get by.  Then, not too long ago, I met this girl named Kimmie.  That has been an akward situation, of which I'm not going into detail.  I started getting close to her.  I've been very closed these past years, but started to open up with her.  I'm not used to being open, so it's been hard.  I don't want to let myself get too close for fear of getting hurt again.  I'm still pretty closed, and lately I'm starting to feel even more closed, and growing distant.  Why?  I've really enjoyed being close to her.  I don't know what's going on here.

My car is almost done.  I've been working on this project now for about 8 months, I think.  I don't know for sure, because I lost count.  Now, it's getting close.  I had to take the intake manifold back off, because I broke one of the bolts.  Weak sauce.  So tomorrow I'm going to get some new intake gaskets, and reinstall the intake.  After that, I just have to run some coolant lines, then it goes up to the exhaust shop.  It's gonna cost me about $600 for the exhaust.  More than I wanted to pay, but it'll be worth it.  I've heard the mufflers that they're going to put on, and I really like 'em.  I want to finish the car this weekend, so that I can get it up to the shop.  Then I'll have to save up the money for the exhaust.  Hopefully, that won't take too long.  I really miss my car.  It has a cd player, the windows work, and it has a 5-speed.

Man do I miss that car!  I've had some fun times in that car.  I've earned myself quite a reputation in that car.  I started sliding that car leaving stops.  Just little slides.  It's since progressed into sliding around turns doing about 50 or so MPH.  I've scared the shit out of quite a few people doing that.  I can't wait to drive my car again.

I think that's about enough for tonight LJ.  It was nice meeting you, and I hope we can talk more often."

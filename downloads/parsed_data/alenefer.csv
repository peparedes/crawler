"event","&nbsp;Travis and I are applying to move out tomorrow!!! Finally. &nbsp;I love my family but I am so ready to have our own place again, and this &nbsp;Ashly time no roommates :3 &nbsp;I am not looking forward to the actually moving portion of things but Travis and I both said as long as we like it there that is where we will live until we can afford to get ourselves a house so hopefully this is the last time we'll have to move for a while.

I love Travis so much. I never thought I would feel this strongly about a guy but I know in my heart he's my soul mate &lt;3 &nbsp;And the best part is and he looks me in the eye when he tells me and I know he means it. &nbsp;It's so wonderful to be loved."

But not because I want to, I have to talk with my group because we have a paper due on thursday.&nbsp; I'm just so over school at this point, but after today I really will make an effort to go to class and do my homework and all that jazz.

How's life with everyone on LJ?&nbsp; All I do is work, go to school, and and hang out with Travis, Matt, Ashley, and Shelley, and occasionally everyone else.&nbsp; I'm loving being in love and having the boys live with us.&nbsp; I'm not sure a year ago I would imagine my life as it is right now but I really dig it.

I think I'm going to go do something productive before my small group class starts. I&nbsp;so don't want to go but it's the only one I&nbsp;can go to at this point so I really should, especially because I missed the last 3 classes because I was sick.&nbsp; But really I've wasted enough time on the net now, it's just been so long since I&nbsp;got to sit down and bullshit for an hour.&nbsp; I think I needed a little time to relax to stay sane.&nbsp; I really should have worked on my paper though...oh well"

I&nbsp;really should be doing some of my reading, I haven't done any yet and I'm strarting to fall a bit behind.&nbsp; I'm just not that into school today, obviously because I knowingly sleep through all of my other classes.&nbsp; I would have just skipped catholic foundations except that it's only 1 day a week so we get docked points if we're absent even once and I&nbsp;have a paper due.&nbsp; I had to bs the paper because the textbook the reading for it was assigned from hasn't come in yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully I'll get it soon, but in the mean time I think I&nbsp;worte a believable paper which is all that really matters.

I am so excited for thursday.&nbsp; We're trying shrooms for the first time and the boys tell me it'll give me a whole new out look on life.&nbsp; Thursday is going to be the longest school day of my life.

And I'm going to now kick myself off the net.&nbsp; Class starts in a half hour and I should probably finish doing the reading out of the textbook I&nbsp;do have for this course."

"event","I'm really sick of being mad at my family for stupid reasons.&nbsp; It's especailly annoying because while I'm annoyed at them I'm thinking about how dumb it is that I'm mad at them for whatever they just did.&nbsp; Like today I find that they've been eating my ice cream.&nbsp; I never had any intention of eating the ice cream and I was actually going to tell them they could have it tomorrow.&nbsp; But they just ate it, and when I asked them not to, because it was mine my mom didn't even stop scooping more into her bowl.&nbsp; She was like I'll buy you more, to which I responded I don't want more, I just don't want you guys to eat it.&nbsp; I think I'm mostly annoyed at the total disregard for my feelings.&nbsp; She just kind of laughed at me.&nbsp; I am so ready to&nbsp;move out.&nbsp; I'm not sure I can make it until June :p&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have like a week of vacation coming up if I can last just one more week! 

I used to be so much nicer and less bitchy.&nbsp; I want to go back to being that person. 

Whine.&nbsp; All I do is angst.&nbsp; My life is pain XD 


See I can't even be mad properly.&nbsp; It's more like I really want to be mad but all I can manage is being slightly aggrivated.&nbsp; I've already pretty much distracted myself as it is.&nbsp; I just wish I was already out of my house so I could like my family again."

It's just so much more fun to plan up coming vactions, and speaking of which: I'll be in Wenachee in a week, and Disney World in 2 weeks!&nbsp; And my birthday is in a mere 11 days!&nbsp; I don't to steal Sara's thunder so I'm keeping my excitement down until Friday.&nbsp; I'm going to be 19, only one year left to use the teenager excuse.&nbsp; I need to get all my stupid out now within the next 12 months."

"event","&nbsp;I can't seem to focus on writing this paper I have due tomorrow.&nbsp; At first I was blaming my lack of concentration on the tv and my mom's insensent talking but I have now turned off the tv and my mom has gone to bed.&nbsp; I just can't seem to focus, my mind is all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; I keep wondering about the store demo, I hope they call me when they know when it's going to go down.&nbsp; I don't think I'm really settled in with not working anymore because most of my thoughts still linger on TRU. It doesn't help that I've recently realised I've developed a bit of a crush on one of my co workers, or exco workers rather XD&nbsp; It's really the worst thing possible, and the more I try not to think about it the more I do.&nbsp; I just need about a week and I'm sure I'll get over it.&nbsp; I got one of those myspace things because Rene said she was going to post some pictures she took and I want to steal some of them but she needs to call me so I can find her on there.&nbsp; Mostly I think I'm distracted because I had lovely coworkers and I'm quite ready to accept that I won't see them anymore so my thoughts have been dweling on them when I don't proper motivation to think about other things (like dumb papers I have no interest in writing)

In other news (because I'm not ready to accept that I absolutely have to write this theology paper tonight)&nbsp; I did my taxes last night and it turns out I don't own money!&nbsp; I'm going to get about $250 back from my federal taxes and it looks like I might be getting $150 back from Oregon, although I'm not positve I did my oregon taxes right :/&nbsp; They were much more confusing than my federal ones.&nbsp; We'll see how it all turns out.

Also today was the first real day off I've had since I can't remember when.&nbsp; I slept in until about noon, watched Perry Mason (shut up I adore that show!) I even went running and watched the documentory on the making of Gladiator.&nbsp; It was so nice to just take my time and not have to worry about getting up at a certain time, I just lazed about and it was the absolute best.&nbsp; I could get used to this, too bad I have that interview on Saturday I may not have free time for too long XD

I only have two more weeks until I'm finished with this semester!&nbsp; I'm so excited.&nbsp; All I have to do is finish this paper and then I have another one due on Friday (which is going to go so fast because it isn't on a retarded topic) and then my french oral exam on Friday as well.&nbsp; But after that I just have to worry about my final.&nbsp; No big major projects or anything.&nbsp; It'll be easy going after I finish this theology paper.&nbsp; Which I really should get back to...It's just so stupid, I hate pointless boring papers.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are so much eaiser to write when you actually care a little bit about the topic matter.

Oh and I'm making Sera go shoe shopping with me on Thursday which I'm excited about XD&nbsp; I know I don't really need another pair of shoes but I'm thinking a cute pair of sandals is a must for florida.&nbsp; Shelley said I need to show some leg so that we can get to the front of lines and if my legs are going to be showing my feet need to look cute too!&nbsp; Not that you ever have to twist my arm to buy yet another pair of shoes.&nbsp; Okay I'm really done ranting about stupid things no one cares about, I am forcing myself to focus on my paper.&nbsp; Really I am!"

"event","I'm so sore!&nbsp; Yesterday and the day before were mostly manual labor at work and I'm really feeling it now.&nbsp; I was dirty it was disgusting.&nbsp; Everything in TRU had 30 years of dust covering it.&nbsp; And if you think I'm lying yesterday the boys found a sealed Atari game from 1982, that's how long it has been since anyone did any kind of deep cleaning.&nbsp; It feels so much like graduation saying goodbye to everyone. I was slighty offended when Moe started to leave last night without coming over and saying goodbye, so I shouted a goodbye to him and then he came and talked for a&nbsp; bit.&nbsp; Seth made me laugh about it though because I told him Moe wasn't going to say goodbye and he called him an asshole.&nbsp; But their friends so it's okay XD&nbsp; I'm just glad others can feel my pain.&nbsp; That being said I'm all done there now except I have to stop by because I forgot to leave my number and email for Trina, she's going to let me know when the demo is going to go down.&nbsp; I also need to pick up the rest of the plastic bags we have left over because Dan was just going to throw them away and it was just too much of a waste for me I couldn't handle it.&nbsp; My entire truck is filled with shopping bags XD&nbsp; We filled Christina's back seat with paper they were going to throw away, because she too felt we were being too wasteful.

UP raised a little over $43,000 at our Relay. It didn't quite meet our goal (50,000) but it's still a good chunk of money.&nbsp; Because I had to work after the Relay I ended up staying up for 41 hours which was interesting.&nbsp; By the time I got to work on Saturday I felt a lot like I was tispy.&nbsp; Moe and I had the same conversation 4 times XD&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still a little offended he tried to leave without saying goodbye.&nbsp; I told Christina I'd yell at him when I stop by the store today.

And I should go to class.&nbsp; It's starts in 5 minutes.&nbsp; I'm so sick of school but I only have this week, next week and then finals on monday and wednesday.&nbsp; Omg tomorrow I don't have to go to school or work.&nbsp; I'm so excited I'm going to sleep in, go running, and then watch my Gladiator documentory.&nbsp; I'm pretty pumped.

Peace!"

"event","&nbsp;I have an interview with Cinema 99 today, I'm excited but nervous.&nbsp; Working at a movie theater would be so nice :D&nbsp; I'd save so much money and it would be like getting a raise because the minimum wage is 13 cents higher and there is no income tax.&nbsp; But I'm worried they either won't like me or they won't like that I have about a week of vaction planned at the beginning of may and I'm not canceling that for anyone.&nbsp; I'm too excited for not camping with Sara and the girls and for going to disney world.&nbsp; Not to mention my plane tickets are non refundable.&nbsp; But here's hoping!

On another not I miss seeing everyone.&nbsp; I haven't hung out with anyone since that lovely time at Kelly's last thursday night.&nbsp; And I suppose that isn't such a long time but it feels like forever.&nbsp; TRU has owned my soul these last two weeks with the liqudation so it'll be nice when that's over.&nbsp; But I am a bit sad to see it go.&nbsp; It's like graduation all over again.&nbsp; I absolutely adore the people I work with so it's weird to think I'm not going to see them all the time anymore.&nbsp; I'll have to stop by the new store when it opens and see who came back.&nbsp; It's just kind of depressing, I'm even going to miss our ant infested break room (it's so nasty and I'm still wigging out and feeling like ants are crawling all over me from yesterday)&nbsp; But I'm going to console myself by thinking about how I'll actually get to sleep in now, even if I do get hired at 99 because it's a movie theater and stuf doesn't start to run until 11ish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Aaaand I should stop procrastinating and go work on my&nbsp; homework.&nbsp; That's what this hour of free time is supposed to be about. I'm so ready for summer vacation.&nbsp; Only like 2 weeks left until finals week though!&nbsp; And then I have days and days of fun planned.&nbsp; It's going to be so full of good clean fun I can't wait XD&nbsp; And I found electronic MASH at my work yesterday.&nbsp; I think I have to buy it for the drive up to wenatchee, because nothing is more stupid girly than MASH.&nbsp; And it's only five bucks (after tomorrow when prices get marked down again) so I don't think there's really a wrong thing about this decision.

UP's relay is this weekend, I'm so nervous.&nbsp; I hope everyone has a good time!&nbsp; I'm also workied I may die on my way hope because by the end of everything I'll have been up for about 40 hours straight :/&nbsp; I wish I had time to take a nap but there really isn't.&nbsp; but I will survive.&nbsp; My plan is to sleep all Sunday.&nbsp; Hopefully I won't have to work, but I think it's our last day so who knows.

I""m really stoping now, I've wasted like 20 minutes and I have a paper I need to rewrite something awful."

"event","&nbsp;Never in my life have&nbsp;I been as frustrated as I am right now with trying to plan out my schedule for next semester.&nbsp; I think the University is conspiring against me.&nbsp; I don't understand why they would make taking classes that are prereqs for basically all upper divison classes in a major so hard to get into.&nbsp; There are so many classes I need to take but can't because I don't have the prereqs done.&nbsp; And what is really annoying is I was signed up for the class I could so badly have used my first semster but the University was afraid it would be too hard for me.&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; I'm just so fed up with this.&nbsp; School is for losers.

But I've come up with a schedule I think I can live with.&nbsp; I have one lab I may not be able to take but I'm thinking about emailing the teacher so see if I could miss the first hour (it's 3 hours) and still be okay.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I want to do yet, I think I'll wait on that until I meet with my adviser on Wednesday.&nbsp; I wish he hadn't been out of town all last week It would have been really helpful to have spoken with him but.... I'm so over it at this point I don't even care any more.

In other news the only day I have off this week is wednesday.&nbsp; And that isn't really like a day off at all because I'm stuck at the school until 4:30.&nbsp; But TRU will be closed by the second week of April so I figure I'll take the hours while I can.&nbsp; I'm going to make bank these last couple of checks :3&nbsp; But it's been really busy these last couple of days becasue of the liquidation and while it's nice not to&nbsp;be bored all the time the store is a mess at the end of the night.&nbsp; I don't understand why it is so hard not to pick up ten tons of shit you don't need.&nbsp; We closed at 7 today, and didn't leave until 8:45, and&nbsp; the aisles were still a mess.&nbsp; I dissaprove.&nbsp; These last couple of weeks may lead to me killing some customers&nbsp; but they're probably asking for it anyway.&nbsp; I just have to keep in mind that I'm making money for Florida and camping.&nbsp; I'm crazy excited for both and it may just be enough for me to forgive all the dumb shoppers of the world.

And I'm done ranting.&nbsp; I can appreciate that I have an eaisly life compared to some, I'm whining about having a job and having the oppertunity to go to a private college after all but it is truely frustrating.&nbsp; I just want the classes I need to be offered and for people not to leave 10 cart loads (and I am not exaggerating) of stuff lying in the wrong places.&nbsp; I don't think that is too much to ask."

And yeah.&nbsp; I'm on spring break right now which is nice.&nbsp; I feel like hitting up the mall right now, maybe I'll give Sera a call and see if she's interested.&nbsp; I really shouldn't spend money but I I want new shoes.&nbsp; And shoes always win out above all else.&nbsp; I also have plans with Cori and Sara so it's shaping up to be a pretty nice week.&nbsp; I'm not even scheduled at TRU again until Saturday.&nbsp; This may or may not work out, neither would surprise me but it's nice to think I'll have some real days off.&nbsp; I work at the school Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10-2 but that's all :D&nbsp; People should give me a call if you find themselves with some free time.

But after I get this I'm going to talk on my phone all the time :3&nbsp; Especially with those that have at&amp;t. I'm kind of excited to get a real plan.&nbsp; Here's hoping I don't go over my text messages XD&nbsp; I'm going to pay the extra 15 a month to get 1500 messages, and I think it's free to message at&amp;t customers so it should work out alright.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all today is turning out a little better.

I guess it's my fault being as I scheduled my classes this early but it's still annoying.&nbsp; Plus I always get her like a half hour early because it's either that or be late D; But I'm done at 1:30 today and that is my favorite. And next week is SPRING BREAK!&nbsp; I'm so excited.&nbsp; Sure I have 2 midterms on friday but then I get 9 days off in a row, with no homework.&nbsp; I'm way jazzed about it. Although I am going to continue to come into work, but we get to chose when we work so I think I'm going to stratigically place my times so that I don't have to deal woth rush hour.

I'm going to go get my new phone after I get out of class today.&nbsp; I know the phone I have now isn't even a year old but I'm switching over to Cricket and new plans usually necessitate a new phone.&nbsp; Either way I'm making my way toward unlimited minutes which means I can talk all the time and not worry.&nbsp; I'm so excited for the freedom of it.&nbsp; And I'll be able to talk to Shelley more because we won't be confined to when I'm at the house :D&nbsp;&nbsp;

My class starts in 8 minitues.&nbsp; I should probably head over there :p&nbsp;&nbsp;

Oh and I don't work at Toys on Friday if anyone wants to give me a hollar.&nbsp; I'm out of work at the admissions office at 5 so that leaves the whole night free :3"

"event","<b><i>This is not just something that happens. This cannot be one of those things. This cannot be that. And for what I would like to say, I can't. This was not just a matter of choice. These kinds of things happen all the time.</i></b>  

Do you have love in your heart? Is it real love? The kind of love that makes you feel that intangible joy in the pit of your stomach like a bucket of acid and nerves running around making you hurt and happy all over and head over heels? I believe it's that sort of love that sounds nice to me. I'm telling you I have love. And in this big game that we play - life - it's not what you hope for. It's not what you deserve. It's what you take.
But I'm sick. I'm sick here now. I should be getting along now. I'm sick and I'm in love. I seem to be the sort of person who confuses the two. But I don't care. Because I love you. I love you and I'm sick. If you want to love me back I'll be good to you, I'll be goddamn good for you. I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach, and I can tell you. I know you don't love me now. 
Do you know who I am? No one special. Just a spoke in the wheel. Who was it that said ""A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself?"" It was the lovely Samuel Johnson, who also spoke of a fellow who was not only dull, but was the cause of dullness in others. But Samuel Johnson has never been hit by lightening. It hurts. It doesn't happen to everyone. It's an electrical charge that finds its way across the universe and it lands in your body, and in your head. What does that mean, ""A spoke in the wheel?"" Things go 'round and 'round, don't they, though? They do, they do. But I'll make my dreams come true. I just don't know where to put things. I really do have love to give. I just don't know where to put it.

<i>Run away to the seashore. It doesn't matter anymore. Doesn't matter anymore. Words dry up and fly away with the passing of the days. Eventually you just let the stone fall. </i>

What most people don't see is just how hard it is to do the right thing. People think that if I make a judgment call, that's a judgement on them, but that's not what I do, and that's something that shouldn't be done. I have to take everything and play it as it lays. Sometimes people need a little help, sometimes people need to be forgiven, and sometimes they need to be punished. It's a very tricky thing on my part to make that call. If you can forgive someone, that's the tough part. What can we forgive? That's the tough part, the tough part of walking down the street. 

I just wanted to come here to say something, something important, something that you said. You said that we would say things and do things, and not lie, not keep things back - these sorts of things that tear people up. Well, I'm going to do that. I'm going to do what you said, and I can't let this go. I can't let you go. Now, you listen to me now. You're a good person. You're a good and beautiful person. And I won't let you walk out on me. And I won't let you to say those things, those things about how stupid you are, and this and that. I won't stand for that. You want to be with me, then you be with me. You see?  

<b><i>Strange things happen all the time. And so it goes, and so it goes. This happens. This is something that happens.</i></b>

peace.

"event","Earlier this week I was both intrigued and disappointed in an official public interview conducted by CBC's <i>The National</i>, the victim being the <a href=""http://www.ndp.ca"">NDP</a> leader Jack Layton. It was organized in the fashion that a few previously chosen audience members recited compelling questions that are currently on the majority of the nation's mind, while an unprepared New Democratic leader found himself muddled and non-committal. However, that is quite unfair in his defence; the pressure that must overshadow his every scrutinized and dissected thought and word process, not to mention the very <i>syntax</i> of the message, which is supposed to represent the very ethics and ideology of the Party itself must be excruciating, especially in front of such a criticizing audience. Yet, I still found myself unfulfilled and unsatisfied by his answers, as much of the audience and Peter Mansbridge himself seemed to concur. 
He easily and directly answered those addressed questions, though, which precisely coincided with those specific issues that his party has consistently reiterated and have methodically organized, such as removing the GST tax from the basic child necessities for low-income families, showing more support for equality initiatives and Aboriginal relations, and setting aside almost 5 billion dollars to fund international development assistance and Canadian environmental technologies to encourage a more Earth-friendly future over the next 4 years. There were many instances later, though, which included much unrelated discussion and repeated reiterations of the obvious points to his lecture, although did not give any clear indication of a definite explanation. He simply gave very general and ideal answers to seriously concerned citizens whose democratic right entails questioning the eligibility and standards that their possible future leader bases their actions on. There were more than a few times when Layton simply stated what they ""would"" do under certain circumstances or what they plan to do for the good of the nation and its citizens, but gave no clarity to the methods by which they would be able to perform some these actions, or where they would obtain the proper resources. These, I believe, are the real answers that we need to hear when deciding on and selecting our proper representative to the rest of the world. 

<i>Intermission:</i> <lj-cut text=""Allegory Heart""><img src=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/000_0049_2.jpg"" width=302 height=400 alt=""""></lj-cut>

<i>The National</i> is now planning on having a similar intimate interview with <a href=""http://www.liberal.ca"">Liberal</a> and <a href=""http://www.conservative.ca"">Conservative</a> leaders, Paul Martin and Stephen Harper, respectively. I really doubt that they will perform any more effectively than Layton because I seem to have become disheartened once again at the ability for the Party system to present itself in a commendable light based on its representatives. We as citizens cannot be so utterly ignorant and gullible as to swallow the force-fed and, most disappointedly, completely unrealistic solutions to such complex problems that do not require idealistic comforts as much as committed resolutions and action. Personally, I would much rather prefer to base my vote (which is this year, unfortunately, invalid) on the morals upheld by individuals, and support someone who upholds similar principles, and follows through with his or her promises with integrity and valour, instead of electing a party with a somewhat corresponding vision, yet I personally cannot control those officials elected into his or her party by the leader himself or herself.    
I'm also starting to come to the conclusion that perhaps youth apathy in terms of governmental participation is better for our country than youths actually voting based on completely arbitrary qualities, or simply choosing by total randomness. An example came to me a few days ago when my friend who recently turned 18 admitted that he is basing the entirety of his vote to which candidate has the best-sounding name. The regional representative for the NDP, titled with the unfortunate surname of ""Bush,"" is off of his list, as well as the Liberal representative, also known as Mr. Priest (my friend is a devote Wiccan). I believe his vote has already been decided by the appealing name, ""Dennis Kucinich."" 
Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

"event","<i>It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.
It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive.
It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain. I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.
I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human.
It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.
I want to know if you can see beauty, even when it's not pretty, every day, and if you can source your own life from its presence.
I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the moon, ""Yes!""
It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children.
It doesn't interest me to know who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.
It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away.
I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.</i>

-- Oriah Mountain Dreamer


We began the preliminary packing of our lives here at home. It's a troubling thing to do when you must again face the sordid past that your mind told your body and heart to forget. 
My mother asked me earlier this evening if I was going to be disappointed to see this house empty by the end of next month. I considered the fact that this was really my only permanent residence which I can still retain vivid memories of; in essence, this <i>was</i> the house I grew up in. This <i>was</i> the town that shaped me. These <i>were</i> the days of my upbringing to real life. I tried to imagine what it would feel like finally walking within each of these vacant, gaping lots for the last time. I concluded that it would be somewhat like walking through them for the first time, a decade ago.
She said that she was sorry she couldn't formulate the same emotions, and admitted that she was incapable of any departing sentiment. 

Period.

I'm not planning anything extensively fantastic for mothers' day; she said herself that she never wants people to make strenuous efforts for just her part, or take leaps and bounds on her behalf. She already believes that I have made such a profound effect on her life during this physically and emotionally draining time in her life that she wasn't sure if she had survived without my help. And although I did attempt to brighten what sliver of life she had left every day in any way I could, I know that she is the most resilient and adaptable person I know, and would have found her own innovative methods to work through her painful recovery. 
A homemade card, a bouquet, and 24 hours of my time devoted to her are what I have to offer her this year. I think it should suit its purpose.

"event","I am under the impression that I should be grieving. Yet nothing has confirmation or even certification. Everything is lingering in a hazy, painfully morbid veil with only convoluted explanations and dishonest comfort. What should I do, where should I go? Dare I make a difference? 
So I wonder if you'll ever hear my voice, or read my notes. That's something time will only tell, and I've got a feeling that it's something that you don't have. Keep your patience, because it's one of the many parts of you that make me whole. Yes, I may not have ever confirmed the notion or performed the physical act of pinning it to reality, but there is a part of my heart that is in your possession. And what should happen if this plan would fall through and the unspeakable should happen? What would happen to that fragile, yet voraciously predominant piece held in the invisible safe behind the lock-and-key within your own soul? Fade into the background, behind streaming credits and grow increasingly fraudulent and tainted with time. That's the worst case, however, for that key has been rubbed dull, and the lock has rusted to capture that piece forever; it may fade, but it may never be exchanged.
Meeting you in the most unconventional manner, I knew that you were unlike any person I've encountered. I know, and I do know, that there are many times that you are universally alone and distant from humanity, but I know that is untrue. I damn my inability to express my affection in such a full capacity as I experience it today, but I knew this had to be the beginning of something. Without the convenience of meeting, you having no comprehension of my existence, the concept had its bittersweet moments, for it only fed the ideal image of you that blossomed in my mind's eye. Now, an intrusion has wormed its way into the core of that foundation and slowly ate its way to decrepitation and left it to fallow. 
It had nothing to do with what you did; it was all a part of your animalistic instinct, and I can't blame you for it. Although, you may have chosen not to go through with it like that in the first place. That is something that I always had a hard time figuring out with you, despite the fact that we're so similar. You constantly had that ingrained obsession, or perhaps an obligation, to please others and sacrifice your own health or pleasure to do so. It's so ridiculous that it had ended up like this.  
Waiting and waiting for the results. It seems surreal that we have to do this together - hundreds of miles away from each other. 
I can't say I'm completely knowledgeable about the disease in particular, but I know that it could very well be the downfall of your happiness and entirety. With that scratching and clawing behind my mind, continually waiting for results, it damn near tears me apart, thinking about what may be reciprocated on me. The bonds would break between us, no doubt; there would always be reminiscing, but I could not fool myself into knowing that you will dependently be there, day after day, year after year. In that regard, I always need some affirmative proof. Without it, without you...
My eyes feel raw and yearn to cry for you, but what if someone should see? What if you had the chance to see and taste them for your own? Would you take it?

<i>- Day's almost over.
- I can turn on a light if you want.
- It's all right...What are we supposed to talk about?
- I told you, I'm doing research, about how the interest in philosophy begins, what it leads to...
- You don't want to interview me.
- I do.
- Danny, it's all over now. Why do you want to drag it up? They fired me, that's all.
- It's not about the job. This isn't about academics, I just mean how it got started for you, what it meant to you...
- Funny. What it meant to me? I was reading this book the other day. There's this fragment I remember. Went something like, </i>People whose best hope for a connection to other human beings lay in elaborating for themselves an elegiac mode of relatedness, as if everyone's life were already over.<i> Seemed accurate to me. 
- How do you mean?
- This idea of living your life as an elegy, inoculating yourself against the present. So much easier if you can see people as though they were just characters from a book. You can still spend time with them. But you have nothing to do with their fate. It's all been decided. The present doesn't really matter, it's just the time you happen to be reading about them. Which makes everything easier. Other people's pain, for instance.
- Did this have something to do with what got you started reading?
- The philosophers -- they were part of that, keeping things at a remove.
- How?
- They were my friends. Reliable. There to keep me company. You spent time with them, they talked to you. They didn't have crises. They were always ready with a little numbered comment. So ideal that way. No dying bodies to drag around. Like a painting. No changes, no disappointments. Everything already over.</i>

"event","<i>Last year the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most powerful Shia religious leader, is reported to have advised his people to adopt the following approach to the new American rulers. Thank them for getting rid of Saddam Hussein, but end every conversation with a question: when will you <lj-cut text=""leave?""><img src=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/1481311_zoom.jpg"" width=301 height=400 alt=""""></lj-cut>
...
One reason (why a revolt commenced by Shias for the first time against the occupation) is that the Americans decided to go after Mr Sadr without consulting the Shia religious parties, including those on the Governing Council. They shut down his small weekly newspaper for alleged <lj-cut text=""incitement to violence""><img src=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/1290004_zoom.jpg"" width=304 height=400 alt=""""></lj-cut>, arrested his top man in the Shia holy city of Najaf, and laid siege to his offices. It appears they assumed Moqtada Sadr would back down, as he did during a similar stand off last year. He didn't. His supporters responded with demonstrations that led to armed revolt in parts of Baghdad and southern Iraq, seizing police stations and other symbols of power. Mr Sadr's support base remained his 10,000 strong militia - the Mahdi Army - and the young, overwhelmingly Shia urban poor of Iraq's central and southern cities. But this time his anti-occupation and anti-American rhetoric struck with greater resonance among the wider Shia community.</i>

<i>In the United States, several million people have succumbed to an extraordinary <lj-cut text=""delusion""><img src=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/1587588_zoom.jpg"" width=241 height=400 alt=""""></lj-cut>. In the 19th century, two immigrant preachers cobbled together a series of unrelated passages from the Bible to create what appears to be a consistent narrative: Jesus will return to Earth when certain preconditions have been met. The first of these was the establishment of a state of Israel. The next involves Israel's occupation of the rest of its ""biblical lands"" (most of the Middle East), and the rebuilding of the Third Temple on the site now occupied by the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosques. The legions of the antichrist will then be deployed against Israel, and their war will lead to a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon. The Jews will either burn or convert to Christianity, and the Messiah will return to Earth.

This means staging confrontations at the old temple site (in 2000, three US Christians were deported for trying to blow up the mosques there), sponsoring Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, demanding ever more US support for Israel, and seeking to provoke a final battle with the Muslim world/Axis of Evil/United Nations/ European Union/France or whoever the <lj-cut text=""legions""><a href=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/1673003_zoom.jpg""></a></lj-cut> of the antichrist turn out to be.</i>
- <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1195568,00.html"">The Guardian</a> reporter, George Monboit


<i>When planning war, military officials have various targets: enemy combatants, their support forces, the surrounding civilian population, and their national infrastructure. But there are other targets as well, although these are not always discussed publicly. Among the most important of these is public <lj-cut text=""opinion,""><img src=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/1289893_zoom.jpg"" width=237 height=400 alt=""""></lj-cut> both the world at large, and the highest priority - that of their own public. This holds true especially in a democracy, when one is fighting a war of choice - as in invading another country - instead of fighting a war of national survival. 

In such wars, issues like human rights and civilian casualties loom larger. Since such casualties are inevitable, special pains must be taken to explain them away. But how to do so? In a word, spin. Such is the conclusion of a just-released monograph, ""Disappearing the Dead: Iraq, Afghanistan and the Idea of a New Warfare"" by Carl Conetta of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Project on Defense Alternatives (PDA). 

Of course, the idea of shaping public opinion is hardly new. For example, a 1975 study by the Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress, in analyzing possible United States takeovers of Persian Gulf oil fields, wrote: ""The administration, Congress, or both - assisted by the mass media - could take steps to sway public opinion one way or another if they believed it advisable."" 

But the PDA documents how the Bush administration has taken spin to a new level. It notes that increased international and domestic attention to the collateral effects of military operations has been a persistent concern of the US defense community since the Vietnam War. And thus has it taken significant steps to minimize that concern. The ""US Defense Department, State Department and White House conducted large-scale perception management"" or ""strategic influence"" campaigns in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as in support of the broader ""war on terrorism"" according to the PDA study. 

One of the Iraqi war incidents analyzed by the PDA was two market bombings in Baghdad that together claimed more than 70 lives early in the war. US and British authorities quickly suggested that these might have been the result of Iraqi air defense missiles falling back to the ground. 

But this was an unlikely scenario, according to the PDA study, for two reasons: the relative numbers of suitable weapons used by the two sides in Baghdad, and the attack vectors and performance characteristics of these weapons. In regard to the first point, coalition air-to-surface weapons outnumbered Iraqi surface-to-air missiles by a ratio as large as six-to-one. Second, minor errors and inaccuracies - even standard ones - in the delivery of air-to-surface missiles could have produced the market attacks. The PDA study states: ""Shooting downward into thickly populated areas is simply a very dangerous and demanding endeavor. By contrast, for an air defense system to have been at fault would have required a string of errors and failures - some catastrophic - in the employment, performance, and functioning of both the system and its failsafe mechanisms."" 

Nevertheless, US and British officials kept making this claim even after a British reporter found and confirmed that debris from the second marketplace bombing came from a US HARM anti-radar missile. 

Of course, such implausible claims could not have flourished without a complicit partner, the <lj-cut text=""media.""><img src=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/1771470_zoom.jpg"" width=303 height=400 alt=""""></lj-cut> The PDA study states: ""Spin is a form of misdirection on emphasizing the minor aspects of an event or promoting a tendentious or idiosyncratic interpretation of it - one that favors one's own interest. However, for spin to work, there must be a media willing to 'take the pitch' (so to speak), rather than letting it fall flat. With regard to the marketplace bombings; the news media's willingness to adopt the uncertainty frame and give the coalition 'the benefit of the doubt' divided along predictable lines. While the marketplace bombings reverberated loudly in the Muslim and Arab worlds, the story has no 'legs' in the United States and only short ones in Britain."" 

Another tactic used by the Pentagon was what the study calls ""lawfare""; the <lj-cut text=""manipulation""><img src=""http://img30.photobucket.com/albums/v90/Nodin/1938325_zoom.jpg"" width=267 height=400 alt=""""></lj-cut> of both public perceptions and international law that aims to create or reinforce the impression that one's opponent is violating either the letter or spirit of the law. The goal is to undermine international and domestic support for the opponent's actions or causes. 

A case in point was the US-British framing of the Baghdad ""shock and awe"" air campaign. At the same time that coalition forces were bombing the city, they also complained about the legality of Iraq's placement of air defense systems in and around residential and industrial areas of the city. In this ""the coalition's case [regarding] air defense was overstated"", according to the PDA study. ""It implied strictures that would have precluded any adequate air defense of the city - an outcome not consonant with the intent of international law. In fact it is not uniformly illegal to operate in or near civilian areas if such operations are militarily necessary. For better or worse, international law gives wide berth to military necessity."" 

Particularly questionable were coalition complaints about Iraq placing air defense systems within 300 feet of residences. In fact there is no international law or rule of warfare that prevents that. Reached by phone, the study author, Carl Conetta said ""their rhetoric implies that unless you place your systems at a distance from a target we chose to hit, that won't hit anyone, it's illegal. It's a typically Orwellian approach."" </i>

"event","I saw her again. Yesterday, out of the corner of my eye. She was getting into her ivory van wearing orange shorts and dark glasses. A white tank top as well, I think. It was out of the corner of my eye. Not quite warm enough yet to wear one. It was a pensive look on her face. That I could tell.

It was after the birth of the second that she began to gain weight. Before, she had a slender, effeminate figure that wasn't as provocative as it was practical. Which suited her career and automotive decisions, if one thought about it. The grooves outlining her facial features now highlighted them and deepened into what seemed to be scars. Above, her withered, parched hair began to thin. A sullen, impenetrable film skimmed over her eyes. Although there's an undeniable vibrancy still lingering. 

That's the way I am so possessive of arbitrary necessities. Each time I see her, the entire history squirms within my head and rushes behind my eyes like a record played at 300 rpm. I've never talked to her.

She gave away all her home amenities so many years ago above the train yard. There was not enough time to hold a yard sale. She was still teaching then. The side to a primary job somewhere else. Finally moved into a smaller house uptown with the rest of the family. She quit by then and left the class. There was another fellow teacher living there as well, now. What did she tell the children?

This was not the nuclear family she envisioned. Not the ideal life she dreamed. Walks the dog each day in orange shorts. Grieving eyes sunken in the pasty, fleshy skin. Dropped threads, abandoned highways, broken hopes swim and tarnish. Should life be like that, she wonders. Her life seemed a future prospect before. Now it's sold to the lowest bidder. Maybe she drove herself here by will. Maybe she wanted it in faith. 


<b>Linden Blossom</b> - <i>Tilia vulgaris</i>

         Folk Name: <i>Lime blossom, Linden, Tilia.</i>
         Skin: <i>Mild astringent, emollient, tonic.</i>
         Body: <i>Antispasmic, diuretic, digestive.</i>
         Psyche: <i>Sedative, nerve regulator.</i>
         Magick: <i>Protection, immortality, luck, love, rest.</i>
              Element(s): <i>Water, fire.</i>
              Planet(s): <i>Jupiter.</i>
              Colour(s): <i>Blue, purple.</i>
              Gemstone(s): <i>Amethyst, lapis lazuli, sodalite.</i>

Used in love spells/mixtures and protection spells and incenses. Mix equal parts Linden and Lavender flowers and place in a sachet under your pillowcase to relieve insomnia. Keep Linden on a table to release the energies needed to keep the spirit alive and healthy. The tea is ideal to celebrate Ostara, or the Spring Equinox - the first true day of Springtide. Energy is building as the days become warmer with promise.
Medicinal uses include remedies for colds, coughs, sore throats, and flu; tea infusions can be used for mild bladder/kidney problems and as a mouthwash/gargle. <i>Do not use for long periods of time, as it can lead to heart damage.</i>

     <i>Coughing Fits:</i> 
1 1/3 oz. St. John's Wort
                                       2/3 oz. Linden flowers
                                       2/3 oz. Thyme
Use 1 tsp. of the herb mixture per cup of boiling water to sooth irritations of the upper respiratory tract that cause coughing. Steep for 5-10 min., strain, sweeten if necessary. This tea has proved helpful with bronchitis and whooping cough.

peace.

"event","What a wonderfully celestial afternoon.

...

It began on my way back to school from the juice and wrap bar downtown. All the while, I marvelled and considered the fervour and intimidating force embodied by such an obscure, unstable essence. I suddenly was overcome with the urge to take a very long detour to grasp a more detailed understanding of this complex entity of nature. 
I preceded to the riverbank where it was strongest, and a majestic, wondrous wave engulfed my senses and I fell into a delusional trance . I'm not even sure how long it may have lasted, but by the time it receded, I felt my nerves more electrified than ever, and an ambiguous sense of power coursing through my blood. 
I knew this had been a moment of intimate union with one of the many forces of the universe. I became so inspired by this brief, radiant window of enlightenment, that I ended in writing several poetic verses based on this revelation. However, I decided not to post it here.* 
I mused later that this particular gale could be considered to be the usher to the beginning of the earth's rebirth; by my eyes, the earth seemed to have ripened into spring immediately after this encounter, and an extensive, yawning feeling of renewal bloomed within me. 
I'm not certain if I should take this as an omen ...or perhaps an devine gesture. Perhaps I should disregard it all together. All that is definite at the moment is the fact that just as the earth should be resurrected in an eternal cycle of equilibrium and reliability, my life should continue in the same manner until the wheel runs rusted to a halt in both states.

<i>Once I took the universe to dinner
When she failed to yeild the earth's demands
'Oh,' she said 'you mean that little ant farm?
I'm alright, dear, I've got other plans'

And we're sad because we think we don't belong here
We're guilty 'cause we think we should be stars
Floating in a navy soup, we're sailing
There you are
There you are</i>


peace.

*As a brilliant artist once said, ""The first one hundred songs you write are going to be shit. And that's a guarantee."" I believe that theory applies to essentially every art form with every stuggling artist, even though in my opinion, this particular poem was quite profound and cultured. Then again, I'm no artist."

"event","Here we fly under the blurring leaf-scapes
Dappled with the Heavens
Between the clouds
Doesn't matter if They follow
We've got backseat room, anyway.
Medley of mists, laden with misery, lingering bitterness, decay, fluttering about like an omen
Blink
And it's all gone from us
But our devoted sense of contempt never leaves
As we fly from here--
To anythere. 
So lean closer
Because the shadows are playing hide-and-seek in your eyes
And I don't know you
But one hand on the wheel and the other on my shoulder
That was made to be caressed by it.
Out of that riot to God-knows
From the screams by closed mouths to the stars appearing one at a time
Since we were apart of the waste to the curves lying ahead
Yearning to be found
Like us.
The sky falls around us one despairing cloud at a time
But we still chase it
With the constellations revealing themselves one star at a time
Never to be found
And we fly anyway, absent of thought or reason
Hoping but knowing
No escape.

peace.

"event","I have come to the conclusion that either nobody puts any effort into reading my journal any more, or that most people do not wish to accept or believe what may upset them or be contrary to their ideal outlook on humankind's future. This, I have determined, since barely any recognition was given to an entry I posted approximately a week before, which, I expected, should have shook everyone to their very cores and rendered them speechless. To refresh your memories, or present this information for the first time, I shall post this URL again. 
I sincerely urge everyone to read through this website, and especially recommend it to others. There may be much here that will disturb you, emotionally and mentally, but please bare through your understandable fear and see it as an obligation to the rest of the world. Please, <i>please</i>, enlighten yourselves and prevent what may be our eventful downfall, that, being ourselves. Especially for the world's upcoming day of mourning and regret, March 20th, possibly marking the beginning of our decent, we must stand up against the war in Iraq and its American occupation, and pray for peace and justice in the outcome. Why not begin here?
Ignorance can be avoided, as can this future.

"event","It's so comforting to know that those cherishing, picturesque moments are still existent in this world. 
<b>
CBC - Spontaneous anti-terror rallies broke out across Spain Thursday as world leaders condemned the train bombings, saying the attacks prove the fight on terror must continue.
</b>
Especially once you realize that during those same moments, hundreds of people much like yourself have died of malnutrition, victims of senseless violence suffer relentlessly, thousands of children lie cold and loveless on the streets, and countless more barely survive under merciless tyrants in deplorable environments that violate almost every basic, human right. 
<b>
BBC - Aristide in Jamaica trip furore: Haitian PM Gerard Latortue criticises Jamaican plans to receive the country's ousted president.
</b>
That's why it's such a comfort to believe that, just for a few instants in a day besides while in slumber, we can put those issues aside and <i>live</i>. Or at least give the impression of living, no matter how mundane it seems later on. 
<b>
CBC - A British man who was held at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay says he was beaten and humiliated by his American captors during his two-year detention. 
</b>
Afternoon spare today, meaning that my spring break technically started earlier. It was relaxing, sitting in the juice bar, blissfully munching away at a Thai wrap with a fruit juice on the side. Content, even. 
<b>
BBC - Qurei berates US' Mid-East role: The Palestinian prime minister says the US is not doing enough to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians and would face a ""real problem"" if it did not intervene immediately to stop the violence.
</b>
Came home early and crashed onto my couch, where then my cat decided was an ideal place to take a nap. So, I took the offer as well, and took a blissful, brisk nap along with her purring in my lap, feeling almost a cosmic, unifying aura forming around us as we slept. Even afterwards when I awoke by a disturbance and she still slept, I basked in the light of late afternoon and closed my eyes.
<b>
BBC - Marine killed in ""friendly fire:"" A Royal Marine initially believed to have been killed by Iraqis actually died under ""friendly fire,"" the Ministry of Defence has said. The secret report, seen by the BBC, describes the original investigation as flawed, full of factual errors and lacking rigorous investigation.
</b>
I figured I was so tired because I spent the night before re-reading a few of my favourite short stories for a delightfully nostalgic and tender few hours by myself. In those few moments I spent, oblivious of time and space and gazing over <i>You Are Not a Stranger Here</i>, I reflected on a few personal matters and questions, indifferent to any answers given.
<b>
BBC - Zimbabwe rules on ""mercenaries:"" Zimbabwe is to charge more than 60 men said to be mercenaries with plotting to ""destabilise a sovereign government,"" Home Minister Kembo Mohadi has said. ""They have not been ill-treated, they are happy,"" said Jonathan Samkange, the lawyer representing the group. Zimbabwe has accused the group of planning of a coup in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea. A government minister has said the men could face the death penalty.
</b>
I'm not sure, but I find these times to be my personal form of intimate meditation, while completely focussed on the item at had and separated from all else. I sincerely hope over time I do not lose this profound ability to connect with the heart of the internal universe and, most complex of all, with my own psyche, as I find many adults have lost or, most terrifying of all, have never experienced it.   

<i>
Don't be afraid to be weak;
Don't be too proud to be strong.
Just look into your heart my friend:
That will be the return to yourself-
The return to innocence.

If you want, then start to laugh;
If you must, then start to cry;
Be yourself don't hide,
Just believe in destiny.

That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself-
The return to innocence.
</i>

Recently checked out my newly-posted marks from the 4 Provincial Exams I wrote last semester...and I can say I am <i>duly</i> impressed...and especially astonished at the results. 
I don't believe I had ever expected to end up with this...or even believed I had the <i>potential</i> in me to do something like this. Although, then again, the exams themselves weren't all that challenging in the first place. Pretty basic material, actually.

<i>There's no more coming back this way
The path is overgrown and strewn with thorns
They've torn the life blood from your naked eyes
Cast aside to be forlorn...
</i>

Overall, I'm fairly satisfied. I suppose I'm just a little shell-shocked to go on...
...although what bothers me the most is the simple question of how I can manage to reproduce these kinds of results for those with such great expectations regarding my ability to do well, and how I may live up to that reputation. 

Now to wait for the UBC writing contest results...

peace.

"event","<i>She-male. Polyamorous. Switch. Newbies. Junior Dungeon Master. These are just a few of the titles worn - along with a profusion of wigs, corsets, leather and latex - by the subjects of </i>KINK<i>, a Showcase Original Series.</i>

I find the documentation of the most obscure and provocative parts of human life to be extremely fascinating. Just to witness these unorthodox lifestyles and their controversial passions makes me shiver and contemplate the diversity and extent that our world and all who inhabit it. When lives may be stripped down to their very core, it reveals exactly what the rest of us happen to be surrounded by and opens our eyes and hearts to the possibilities of the potential of the human soul. 
Along with my newfound respect for the unsung heroes of the arts and entertainment scenes and all of their network affiliations, I have found, much like many other fans, the Showcase Original Series ""Kink"" to be an excellent source for these intense, intimate, and ultimately unique journeys of the hearts of the alternative. These subjects follow this journey of sexual discovery and adventure on the search for their identity, individuality, the unification with their community, the fight for acceptance, and even love. However, no journey if fulfil without some conflict of interest, some sense of personal debate on contemplating a complete sex change, and even the insecurity that comes with having one's limits constantly challenged and pushed ahead. All of these aspects which these subjects must deal with only strengthen their will to continue their quest to define their existence and shatter the norms of society while in the pursuit of living.
Catch it, Fridays at 9:30 pm. 


Doctors played your dosage like a card-trick. 
Scrabbled down the hallways yelling ""Yahtzee!"" 
I brought books on Hopper, and the Arctic, 
something called ""The Politics of Lonely,"" 
a toothbrush and a quick-pick with the plus. 
You tried not to roll your sunken eyes, 
and said ""Hey can you help me, I can't reach it."" 
Pointed at the camera in the ceiling. 
I climbed up, blocked it so they couldn't see. 
Turned to find you out of bed, and kneeling. 
Before the nurses came, took you away, 
I stood there on a chair and watched you pray. 


peace.

"event","It was the Elephant Man's face that constantly reflected in my head - the deceptive tracks he laid down for a simple laugh out of his enraptured audience. On first reaction, I thought him to be an uncaring creature of misery, rolling out of his cot morning after the next for the prospect of a few dollars' reward. His story reverberated throughout the day, but now only his face remains; his callus tale and its disgusting details became almost entirely lost on me, yet the plastic veil of the elephant's face constantly burned in my eyes and reenforced the story's purpose. It reminded me of the way I will always watch films muted, with only its pretty colours projected out from the translucent screen, bathing the walls of my room in vague shades of reds, yellows, but especially the dingy, dry shadows of grey and white. It gives me a sense of importance, understanding, yet without any definitive certainty as to the sequence of events. It forces me to observe and comprehend sense in my own terms, instead of what others guide me into. I find that it also gives the film itself an aura of cosmic secrecy which cannot be simply deciphered, but worn away by assumptions and creativity, even if by the credits, its characters and meaning become  mere fragments of truth and actuality in my mind as compared to the director's intentions. Filling the mouths of the muted characters carries in me a sensation of admiration and respect for those involved in the film's process, for they always present themselves as masterpieces in the eye of my mind; they're concepts completely out of my grasp of perception. Although this method may transport me into such an alternate state of consciousness that my existence seems insignificant and naive as compared to the uncertainty and untold passion of the swimming world around me, I realise that once I hit that mute button once again, the flood of discontent, superficialness, predictability, and undefinedness should drown my soul; in other terms, I realize that I deceive my own senses. 
However, what this man, Elephant Man, had done was inexcusable, for he had nowhere near the same intended impact that my own deception affects me, that is to strengthen my senses and open my heart to the potential and beauty of the living. The story that he recited for the God-knows-how-many-th time in that seaside boardwalk, behind that haunting elephant mask, recounted the death of his family in a brutal house fire set by his pre-pubescent daughter who was threatened to give up her cherished pet dog for sanitary reasons, but instead lashed out in such violent anguish with a gasoline can and her inside their house. His tone continually slackened and grew raspy and distant as time progressed, and the small group listening empathetically to him. That is, until he began laughing and confessed that he made up his gruesome tale. They applauded and saluted him with coins and paper bills, but my attention was spurred away by distain and resentment from the feeling of my deepest sorrow being manipulated for pleasure and entertainment. 
That became just another fork in the path, I find here and now, and it became another step in the wrong direction as it always does. Lying, under these tables, surrounded by naked chair legs, motionless but not blind. I watched, lids half-closed, watched the feet dancing and swaying under the lights, in tune with the blaring noise, the crowded and perilous streets beyond, and the tipped bottles soaking alcohol into my long hair, fanned out across the floor like slender, groping fingers, but always watching. 

So I continued along those streets, not yet crowded and noisy however, opposite to the direction of the Elephant Man; I used everything in my power to become clear of his essence, or perhaps it was just to escape the bitter taste of discomfort left in the back of my throat. Away from the sea, clearing the acrid sting of the salty air, and replaced by the congested stench of the city sidewalks. I became unaffected, however, and my detective sense of beauty slowly regained itself, so I unslung my camera and began shooting everything that lurks beneath the surface of this city life. The day, drawing into the twilight of summer, dragging the heat away by its feet to leave the purple afterglow of coolness on the cement. Title-ing, as I made my way: <i>Cinco De Mayo, Early Man, Virgin at the Window, Puppeteer, The Scarlet,  Prisoners of Hope...</i> Idly sauntering down the concrete path, taking no notice of the hustle-bustle of ordinary lives skimming the surface, the only place that these lives may exist, like ghosts, while I make a detour into these depths. Before my sense regained and I resurfaced, I had unconsciously found my destination to be on the stoop of Jakob's house. The months of finding my second home here at his apartment had engraved this trail to his door, so while my mind and eyes wandered, my feet had not, but only brought me back full-circle. I know now, lying here, and I even knew then, that the choice to take those few familiar steps to the main door, and only one more flight to his own, I would have to take a step back in time and relive those regrets, those tears, those uncomforts. My fate denied the idea of a hidden benefit to this plan, and only perceived the reasoning to be a lack of faith and courage to go forward on my part, and a sense of defeat to linger in the past. 
What compelled me to do it? Closure couldn't have been an option, nor the longing for amends and an urge to regain that intimate connection. It had been something deep within the pit of my heart that cried out for console, but not from him, and  retribution. So I mounted those steps, and walked into the lobby and began on the rickety, lifeless stairs. 
I reflected on the once sweet perfume of our relationship, and recalled the ticket stubs that still lie in the bottom of a box underneath my bed, signifying one of our first nights of authentic bonding. They were from the almost-forgotten tickets of a boxing match we went to see in the basement of a local gym. It may not have been the archetypical first date in most relationships, but then again, seeing a film had been ruled out due to my unorthodox habit. These thoughts, however, melted into the stagnant decay of our last few weeks as lovers, for our actual selves were uncovered during that time, and we agreed that the sight of one another was too unsettling to live with. The consideration that he may be drunk, or perhaps busy with another as I reached him had crossed my mind for a fleeting moment, but was dashed away when his door came into sight within the long, untended hallway of the building. 
To my relief, he had not been drinking, and had been, in fact, alone as I entered his apartment, confessing that I had no clear idea as to the purpose of my presence after we greeted each other. I told him that he looked well. Quite well, actually. But before I could get any more out, he told me that he was late for an appointment and was just going to leave, and suggested that I should join him and catch up, in case I had no other plans...or ulterior motives. I accepted, and we were on our way to the bar two blocks down, known as Our Spot to carouse and socialize. We talked and debated of the past and future on our way, and I unfailingly and deliberately warmed to him; the cold sense of vengeance that had been planted like a spark into my head as I approached his door had been snuffed out in such a reassuring breeze as his. I forgot those nights of lying in bed, awake no matter how low my eyelids drooped to listen for the faint jingle of keys in the doorway; the pleadingly, unquenchable urge to call up Pat out of spite and for satisfaction had dissipated; the guilt and shame he inflicted upon me when he adopted the role as the persuasive control switch during those long days and longer nights were pushed aside. So I walked with him, through the doors of the bar, and joined a seat with him, soon accompanied with his, and some of my, old friends. He make me realize, no, <i>re</i>-realize why I had chosen him out of the millions of other men outside in the big black world of the cold night, because right then and there, he rekindled his ability to make me feel as though I was the only person on Earth accompanying him, and made that world seem much smaller and warmer than it actually was. We looked into each other, and all the rest faded with our senses. My breaking point, I found.
So I ended here, and here is where I lay now, reflecting on all this, which led up to this point. Why I should be so absently led around by a collar in the hands of my emotions, powerless as to the direction of my journey, and opening my eyes just to witness the extent of my destruction and lack of control, only to be left to pick up the pieces that have fallen and clean up these messes I cannot be accounted for? The lights pulsing on the floor, the tabletops, everywhere but down here with me and the beer soaking my hair and clinging my clothes to my skin. He slipped away from me again, from my exposed heart and open arms, to leave me crumpled in the corner, away from the world and bent to my emotional breaking point. Do I find something satisfying in deceiving myself, or is it the thrill of the outcome that spurs me on to exist, only to find that it pushes me back down? Or have I even gotten up at all? His feet sway and step in beat with the noise along with the rest of the others surrounding him. Here, lying with my pale cheek on the colder floor, I realize that given all of these facts of deception, it becomes so difficult for me to relax at the thought of such an easy death, and find that I tend to forget that I can't get shot in the back if I don't run from it.

peace.

"event","I haven't completely decided upon whether I should keep this journal as a permanent record for the daily events in my life, of the horribly tragic stories of existence, of the reckless display of mundane, vapid, and arbitrary notions and opinions on menial obstacles and issues, or opposed to the subjective observations of discovery, understanding, and acceptance. Perhaps these journals are intended for either or both sides to the matter, and interpreted by the user himself. In reflection to the posts of my past, I appear to have chosen the former option, which concerns me in the sense that I cannot recollect if they directly represented my behaviour and attitude of the time at which I wrote them. Thus, I choose to continue my journal's future in the form of elevated mental compositions with deeply pronounced segments of introspective reflection and analysis. I believe this should present itself as a more favourable method of preserving my youth and echoing its basic essence to the future.

<i>
there was one-
a poplar or an ash-
blackened, not burnt but suffers;
standing for this time in between
but i haven't seen
everyday.

everyday.
glowing like neon 
from an artificial ceiling,
resisting my relentless lumber
in passive slumber:
idle blinds.

branches fell;
from the unseen crowns- 
crumbled ravens in winter fog-
to the barren, waxen land, to me,
but no sound at my feet: 
but eyes shut.
</i>

It's a shame, however, how there's such a fine red line separating authentic comprehension and reasoning with pretentious, specious behaviour.

There's no way to know where to go from here. It seems to me I've been thinking about it all these years you've been gone, like there was some big mystery out there coming for me. But the longer I sit here and wait for it the more I realize that it's never going to come. That it was up to me to go and dispel the myth of it myself. But having realized that, it's like my feet are stuck in cement and I can't move. You know Chris has kids now, a boy and a girl and you'd love them. Tamer than we were when we were little. I look at them and think that maybe Chris had it figured out a long time ago. That he went searching and figured out that there's just some old man behind a curtain pulling ropes and levers. Sometimes I want to ask him about it but can't bring myself to do it. What would he think I wonder? Who would be the failure then?

And their friends, the loitering heirs of City directors;
Departed, have left no addresses.
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept...
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
But at my back in a cold blast I hear
The ratttle of bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.""</i>

                                                    - T.S. Eliot, ""The Waste Land""


I suppose it's anybody's guess as to why I'm updating now after such an extended hiatus of desolation and stagnation, but I suppose even a flower will bloom out of a pile of manure. 
But no, that's not entirely fair; I have had great moments in the past months of utterly astounding creativity and enlightenment, but most of which is too tiresome and arbitrary to recite. Or perhaps it's too incredibly significant and compelling to ignore and not express to others. Either way, it's in the past and has completed its arduous chore.

So to reiterate, I'm not entirely sure why I should be doing this now, right here, for 'now' doesn't appear to be such a tremendous turning-point in my life or a time of great change, but here I am, and this is it.
I <i>have</i> matured, I believe, and I <i>have</i> learned, mostly from my past, over this time of a few months, yet the resulting product of today doesn't appear to contrast with the person I was before I stopped posting. Many habits and traits, I suppose, remain and others have sprung anew in the meantime, however life is an ongoing process, and some things cannot be defeated. That is one credo I live by, however it may just be a lame excuse to be able to stand by and allow my vices to thrive.

It appears to be the Day of Paradoxes.    

Thus, due to the irrelevance, or perhaps the relevance, of this gap in time, I don't feel a need to recount those events that aided in sculpting my character, but leave it at the reader's imagination to fill it in. On to the present future.

I suppose the most significant change in my life at this point was the decision made by my parents to move from Revelstoke immediately following my graduation. The fact that they decided to move had obviously no real effect on me, for they have discussed continuously of the escape from the jaws of the tooth-like peaks that surround us over the many years, and have assumed to do so after I have fully completed my high-school graduation, as much as it pained them to accept. After all, what judgement is there in a world that would pull a delicate student out of his school so late in his education and at such an inopportune time, so as to simply set him down in a completely foreign environment for just another year or two? And so, after the government's accepting of my father's request for transfer to another national park earlier this winter, he chose Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan as our next home, much to my assumptions and my mother's exuberance. Of course, this decision does not have such a profound impact on my life because I am, as many other graduating students are as well, planning on transferring directly to a post-secondary institution nowhere <i>near</i> Prince Albert (for obvious reasons), and would become my new home, or at least my house. This concept does not seem to be absolutely comprehensive in the eyes of my parents who believe this to be an utterly scarring and traumatic moment in my life, for reasons surrounding the fact that I will no longer have ""a childhood home to come to during the holidays,"" which doesn't phase me with much gravity. And although I understand it <i>will</i> be difficult to leave this town and the people and memories residing in it, I have been preparing and anticipating this event for quite a long time now, and I feel I already made my peace with the fact. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to the moving fiasco in a few months, and living out of a hotel during my graduation and provincial exams at the end of June.     

Speaking of provincial exams, I find that my last semester's four accounts with the said horrors were handled quite well for my taste. They were, in fact, less difficult than I had anticipated and much more straightforward than they previously lead on. Contrary to my belief, they actually <i>are</i> designed to be begun and ended in two and a half hours, as opposed to my fears that I would be left with only three-quarters of the entire exam done by the end of time, and resulting in the pencil being ripped out of my hand, much like almost every other exam I've encountered. However, I finished each of them in perfect timing with positive suspicions by my own mind. Biology was a complete breeze as I had suspected, math was surprisingly easy, English lit. had been a bit of a challenge but straightforward, and English, I felt, I had excelled in. Thanks to Mr. Pfeiffer's guidance and support, I was able to compose a lucid, interesting, and compelling narrative for the third section of my exam, the 300-word original composition. A great source for ideas to write about mainly came from a voluntary competition for all BC grade twelves and elevens to write a provocative, intelligent, and ingenious essay on a specific topic in three hours, funded and controlled by the University of British Columbia, who also judge them and choose the best 25 or so for prizes. A recently undiscovered corner in my head revealed a perfect source for inspiration to write that essay, and it came adapted from a moving short film that gave an incredible account into the life of a damaged psyche. It had touched me with such a horrific tenderness that it imbedded itself into my subconscious for just such an opportune time as that, and I put my own spin on the storyline to give it a kind of allegorical theme related to the subject of the essay, and by the end, I was proud to hand in that narrative and say it was mine. The film, by the way, was an independent short film by Canadian director Jeremy Podeswa, called ""Touch,"" and based on the story by Patrick Roscoe, and i sincerely urge anyone and everyone to experience its profound message in macabre themes and tones. Another source of creativity came from an in-class exercise we all performed in English about a week before the exam to practice for it, and for the exercise we were instructed to develop an original narrative in exactly one hour and would be marked just as it would be if it had been in a provincial exam. I had discovered a plethora of imagination again in some secret recess in my mind that constructed a twisted tale of a police crime-drama crossed with ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and turned out masterfully.

But that's quite enough musing on my genius (cut to me laughing), and might I add conceitedness, and I think I must finally address my newfound respect for indie culture. I wholeheartedly believe that this was completely due to Stephanie's interjection between myself and my taste in music, that being mostly surrounded in the moderate-to-mainstream theme. However, in my defence, I was no stranger to the arts in the indie scene, for I regularly dove into those regions with an open mind and a taste for adventure, and many of my favourite bands and artists had either begun as independent music when I began liking them, or had been and still are completely indie-based. For example, I was and am a great fan of such artists as Esthero, Sarah Slean, Erin McKeown, Holly McNarland, Matthew Good, Hawksley Workman, and Tori Amos, and such bands as The Be Good Tanyas, The Flaming Lips, The Avalanches, The Abandoned Pools, and Dirty Vegas. I had simply chose not to stray too far into those nethermost regions in fear that I would be biting off more than I could chew, and attempt to sample too many flavours without any pre-research in the subjects and genres and not realize which ones had true potential and energy, and which were clearly touting their own ignorance and lack of talent. Logically, what I needed was someone, someone close to me to almost be referred to as a <i>friend</i>, to guide me and become my mentor in the deep, murky waters of the independent genre and give me insight into what was the conventional and what was the provocatively risque. Enter Stephanie and her stunning array of The Weakerthans, Broadcast, Longwave, Metric, Spoon, Stereophonics, and so much more. To all of this I immediately grappled to and wrestled with such a passionate intensity that it left me breathless and astounded at the possibilities and expanse of this music. And for this, I remain completely thankful and grateful, for it has allowed me to stray from the mainstream flow of redundancy which I have for ever felt some resentment and disgust of, and saturate my mind with the soothing and explosive rhythms and melodies of these indie artists. It has also played a significant role in the blossom of my creative mind and imagination, I find, and may further enhance that essential part of myself.

I may even reconfigure the composition of my LiveJournal account.

So, could this be the beginning of the resumption of blogging in my life and on this convenient online journal? It may be to early to tell, but I sincerely wish to post more frequently, believe me. I may urge myself to do it more often, however not as frequently as I had in the past; I believe the only reason I had appeared to post so fervidly earlier was because it had been my only outlet of personal expression that I had during the summer months, but as soon as that 70% of emptiness in my life had been filled by education and schoolwork, I was lead astray from the Journal. However, since this semester appears to have a much milder affect on my life than the former because my time is consumed by only three instead of four classes, I may have more time to delve into more recreational activities. That, and the fact that all three of my classes are completely scientifically- and theory-based, and thus there is no outlet for my bubbling creativity, as I had in my English 12 and English Literature 12 classes in the first semester. 
Now, I hate to leave you, reader, on such an anticlimactic note, for I realize how intently and enrapturously you read these posts, yet all beginnings must come to an end. So I walk back, out of this town, back to the place of my birth, and go as I came.

peace.

"event","Gawd, I truly have forgotten what it means to be a child...

My two youngest cousins along with my uncle and aunt stopped over at our house yesterday evening on their way to the Okanagan I belive to their cabin and had to stay the night here. So we all greeted each other when they came around 9:00 PM, and it had been almost a year ago since I saw Jacob (6 years) and Halle (8 years), and they had actually grown quite a bit since then. It was almost as if the moment they saw me they jumped onto me and clung to me with a death grip...no hesitation, no timidness, no nothin'. Like we had been best friends forever...not to say we're not friends, I mean...well, y'know. Anyway, <i>I</i> had to be the one to entertain them for the next few hours of course while the adults conversed and caught up on current affairs even though I wanted to be over there instead of over here...so we just kinda hung out, the three of us, because I really hadn't expected to be the one to take care of them, and I had really forgotten what it was like and what had entertained <i>me</i> when I was 6/8...so they really just came up with whatever they wanted to do and I tagged along and talked and joked around, which was mighty fun, to say the least. The night included surfing on Neopets, carrying them around at the same time on my back, gymnastics, colouring with crayons, freaking out over a huge spider on the stairs, whipping a stuffed toy at each other, and weighing each other. But, <i>man,</i> I dunno where the hell they get all of that energy they have from...I was breaking a sweat half way through the night! I guess that's just the metabolism of youth... 

Kids are the greatest though...they're so innocent and ignorant that you could tell them anything, and they would still cling to your every word and become so amazed over anything and look at you like you're some kind of super hero. It was all good though...they're really great kids, of course. They're relatively well behaved, well spoken, and pretty great artists for being so young. Halle is really exceptionally smart and well-adjusted, and Jacob too, although can be pretty hyperactive and wild...although they'll always be apologetic if they happen to make an accident or what not, and help clean up...hope <i>my</i> kids will be that well-mannered. :)

Anyway, this morning I was woken up at around 9:30 after about 6 hours of sleep by the kids in the backyard yelling and running around (which happens to be right outside my window). So I got up, and later on, it was the cutest thing, Jacob goes up to me and says, ""<i>Finally!</i> You're up!"" even though I could have gone for at least another 2 hours. They thought it was strange that I would wake up so late when they usually get up around 6:30 am. The mind boggles to believe <i>I</i> used to get up that early too. Later, he gave me a landscape of hills, fireworks, and the three of us as bears he had drawn earlier, and it was pretty cute. Finally, before they had left, the three of us went into the backyard to play some catch, and boy, they are really good with the power and the aim of the ball. I guess it's true that the generations continually become more and more advanced and more intelligent than the rest...

So, yes, that was my family adventure this weekend, good times. Um, I believe that's it that's going on.

peace.

"event","Awww, man...why are all of TV's greatest shows on either their last season or are already cancelled? ""Oz,"" ""Sex and the City,"" ""Friends,"" ""X-Files,"" ""Family Guy,"" ""Mad About You,"" ""The Kids in the Hall,"" and ""Six Feet Under."" And for <i>some</i> reason, instead of airing these fine programmes, they prefer to show ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" ""South Park,"" ""The Man Show,"" daytime TV talk shows, the FOX network, and HUNDREDS of reality shows which put before the public mind-numbing concepts and premises that will be the downfall of civilization, and turn our world into a cultural wasteland. But then again, almost <i>everything</i> on TV contributes to this effect. Oh, well... 

Anyway, on a side note, I'm kind of enjoying, as horrible as it is to say, that my mom is gone...I can actually cook meals! It's great! <i>La cuisine</i> is my domain! And they're actually <i>good</i> meals. Not to say I don't like my mother's...she has about 15-20 actually good meals to serve us, but she constantly uses them over and over again and it becomes repetitive over time...believe me...it's like there's no variation to them! The same servings, the same tastes, the same flavours, the same dishes...there's none of the special spiced up and jazzy meals you see on cooking shows, really...so now I can experiment and throw all kinds of shee-at into the pot and make something that says POW-ZAM!...on the other hand, I gots to do a lot of the cleaning...it's like my dad leaves the entire house dirty and full of garbage until the weekend when he cleans it all up then, not gradually through the week until a slow cleaning day...I wonder if that was what it was like when he was at Kelsey...oh, well, live and learn. I'm still having fun though.

Oh, and the fires are still raging all around us, with the flames licking the town borders...who knows what'll happen? We had to even re-schedule our bike trip because the place we were planning on going is ravaged in wildfires, so we'll go somewhere else. 

Tomorrow? Probably continue my CAPP hours for a while, then look at the national colleges and continue my research. Or perhaps something else more interesting.

peace.

Where do you call home
Is it underneath the sky
That won't leave you alone
If only it was raining water
And not no educated bums
Because it's some of the man's business
Or some other man's wrongs

What do you call a friend
How come the best of them ain't people
But by definition dogs instead
Like lustered lives are buying shit
They won't cry when you're dead
Too far
Too fast
Too little 
Too late, they say, ain't it

<center>in the morning
through the streets have there be no people
no emergency
no parade

just the bells of st. laurence
and the empty mile to walk out of this town
back to the place of my birth
to go as i came</center>

Have I forgotten the warm breezes of joy and blissful romance on my cheeks, only to realize that I had never felt these at all from the beginning?

Have I kept these strange, bubbling emotions in a vault for all of my waking life, ignorantly believing that it was my mirror to keep me company, only to recently find that it was not enough, that I actually...need a companion?

Have I repressed, only to burst, shed these wary tears from that deep, aching groove within my heart?

"event","Hmm...I was talking to Laura today about Bjorn...I'm not too sure why I'm all that interested about his...well, what you want to call a <i>life,</i> but we were talking because she had recently ran into him at McDick's, and he actually had come to the conclusion that he hates Matt, his former, *ahem*, <i>boyfriend.</i> To this, I was not surprised, of course. He had recently told me that after one night (or day, whatever) of action, <i>finally</i> after almost a month of ""seeing each other,"" Matt had sort of ended it with him, for some reasons which are not my own, so, now, naturally, Bjorn's thrown into a typical hissy-fit all over it. Fortunately for him, he has two new backup boy toys he's met to help in his time of pain and grief. I try to stay away from anything to do with his love life as much as possible, so I didn't go into it any further. Apparently Matt had again crossed over to the straight side again because he had discovered a bounce-back girl now, and apparently even while they had been going out, he had an...*ahem*...""affair"" with some chick. Ah, the lifestyles of the queer. 
Why did I bother putting all of this into scripture? Oh, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe it's because I realize that all Bjorn is trying to do is find some happiness in this confusing , swirling world, carve out a place of his own in someone's heart, but I really don't think he's looking in the right places...be that the people or the location he's doing it in. It's simply a demonstration of how, for the good of himself and the people around him, he needs to get out of here and into a <i>real</i> town that's swimming in fags just like him!

Scientists say the universe is expanding all the time but what is it expanding in to?

Got any more?

"event","Boy, I've had quite a lot of mixed emotions these past few days. Friday was giddiness and contentment, yesterday was exhaustion, amazement, and purely pissed off, and today...well, I guess it's pretty much just aching. I've got a feeling this'll be a looong entry, so let's begin at the beginning, hmm?

On Friday, the ONLY interesting day that week 'cuz I had done nothing the days before, I took a ride with my mom and dad to Kamloops (one of the biggest cities in BC) because my mom had to see the specialist there about her condition which no one here had any idea what it is. So the ride there was boring as always, however as soon as we got about 45 minutes outside of Kamloops, everything got really smoggy and the air was choking with soot and smoke, due to the horrendously gigantic forest fire happening outside of the city. It's such a horrible sight to see. Anyway, when we got there, we first went to the mall...I forget its name...but, yeah, we grabbed an Orange Julius, then dad and I went to the sports store to look for a new bike helmet for me cuz the one I'm using now is from grade 3, and isn't <i>quite</i> fitting so well anymore for some reason...:p So we looked around,  but there was nothing there. I then checked out the Bootlegger to see if there were any of the shorts that I bought in Calgary were there, but there was nothing cuz their new shipment of men's clothing was to come in the next week or so. Dinger. But I did happen to find an excellent olive tee that looks really good on me. Anyway, I then went to Thrifty's while dad went to look for mom at the Hudson's Bay, potentially getting lost there. ^.^  I soon discovered while hunting around Thrifty's that I prefer their fashions much more than any other clothing store I've been to. Their clothes are so simple, yet so eye-catching and original, as well as quite inexpensive and full of good quality, compared to the logo-riddled and garish apparel other stores advertise. So I bought this pair of shorts that look good as well. I also wanted this other shirt that would look quite <i>smashing,</i> however dad told me that it was one already, and mom wanted to be at the doctor's at quarter past, so we really had to hurry, and there wasn't enough time. Dinger again. So we dropped her off at the doctor's, and while the doctor-person-guy did some painful tests on her (including electrodes and jolts of electricity...ouch), dad and I went to Sports Mart and got a shiny cool new helmet pour moi. It was pretty hard to find a <i>normal</i> looking one, though...practically every one I looked at looked as though they were designed for hardcore mountain-bikers who like to show off all their expensive, flashy equipment that they use maybe twice a year. Anyway, I found one that was remotely simple and normal, then we headed over to the Office Depot to pick out a new office chair for me, once again, because my old one is a GREAT hazard (four-arm base), uncomfortable (practically just two flat cushions stuck at a 90 degree angle), and just plain useless. So, yay! I'm finally up-to-date with the rest of the modern world!...seat-wise...Yes, I'm very proud of my new comfy chair...it's all pretty and can rock, and goes up and down, and it's grey, and its got armrests, and it spins, and it's cool. :D 

Oh, I just about forgot about Thursday at Laura's. Well, I'll get back to that later. 

Um, yeah, anywho, we then had some lunch at the Great Canadian Bagel, which was <i>exceptionally</i> yummy, then picked up mom, who said that the damn doctors STILL don't know what's wrong with her...they checked her out from head to toe, (spine, legs, nervous system, brain) and still can't find anything. Yay to modern medicinal science. So, we went home, and I assembled the chair which I am currently sitting in...ahhhh...

RIGHT, so, yesterday was quite rewarding as well. Dad and I had planned to go hiking up Mt. Sir Donald that day, so we got up at 7 and got on the road east to Glacier National Park to the trail head. It was an exceptionally sunny and the weather was delightful the entire day. The trip up to the campsite is about 4 km from the trail head, but  the trip there is <i>very</i> steep, rocky and definitely not for novices, even though we saw about 6 people making their way down so early. It took us surprisingly about one and a half hours to reach the end of the trail and the campsite, which really wasn't anything great, for all three of us had done it a year ago, but it was still very nice...the sun was shining, lots of blue sky, and the water was so crystal clear and refreshingly cool. However, this was not our final destination, even though that's really as far as the trail is supposed to go. We headed up this steep, high moraine (a narrow trail with steep sloping sides off of its edges) which we precariously made our way across and lead us to a scree slope and several slippery snow patches which we had to cross in order to lead us to the Holy Grail, a huge cirque, known as the Sir Donald col. When we finally got there, after 3 hours of rigorous hiking from the campsite, it was worth every minute. I don't think I can even explain its true beauty or extravagance here...let's just say that it was, and I would recommend it to anyone who would think of trying it. It was amazing of the full spectrum of sky and distance in all directions that could be viewed from way up there...Anyway, there were quite a few people there, unsurprisingly, who were planning on climbing to the very top of the mountain the next morning and had set up several tents there, so dad and I took a breather and enjoyed the view. I took a few pics, then we made our way down. Oi vey.

That was definitely the worst part about the trip. On the way up, I had barely eaten anything, and I had started to get a headache, which, I suspected, was simply due to a low blood sugar level, which I would take care of at the col. However, even after eating a lunch full of sugars, it still persisted, however not as strong. We made our way down, and it was pretty tough going, and by the time we reached the first campsite at the beginning of the real trail, my thighs were aching, my feet were sore with blisters, my calves were screeching, my lungs were on fire, and my head was pounding. I seriously could not have been more uncomfortable at that moment, however, I suppose I was wrong. The rest of way down was the worst...full of rocks, outcrops, sunburns, stumbles, exhaustion, and so forth. This was literally my first hiking trip of the season since last year, and I was pretty unprepared for it...Oh well, I suppose it was worth it...Back home, I took a warm bath that seemed to help, later rested in my agony...:p Sure, I may be over-emphasizing it all, but I swear it was agonizing...I'm <i>still</i> sore all over my body. So yes, it was an interesting few days. 

Right, back to Thursday's with Laura...I went over there that night to just hang out and do stuff and check up at what's going on and what's new with her room, and what not. We talked for a while about how ironic it is that the guy that she's had a crush over for about a year and a half had broken up with his bitch of a girlfriend and is completely AVAILABLE NOW, even though she's started going out with her ex-boyfriend again around the same time her crush became available...poor her! :) She's practically kicking herself now that she should've screwed him while she was single cuz he didn't even do his bitch of a girlfriend when they went out, so the bitch cheated on him and crushed him, and JUST when he was horny and vulnerable, Laura started dating again...*sigh* So she was extremely tempted to quit last weekend during the Kokanee Weekend for various reasons...she and her crush were the only ones organizing the entire group of workers at McDonald's, and her group was uncooperative, unproductive, and plain bitchy, as were practically all of her customers, and she and him had resulted to several breakdowns and screaming sessions in the back of the restaurant.

I checked out her new cool aquarium she set up and bought herself, with some pretty fishes in it, and her sweet flatscreen plasma and DVD player, which we later watched Old School on...not bad, kinda pointless though...and while we were downtown picking up the movie, her mom (the head veterinarian at the vet department) had let us go there and play with some of these ADORABLE three little kittens that they found on the side of the highway in a box about a week ago, and they were only like 6 weeks old! They were so playful and funny...we let them loose in the bathroom, and they went nuts after each other! Heeheehee...

So, yes, those were the three most eventful days this summer, all of which were very rememberable and pleasant in their own ways. I guess that's all, and I will revert back to doing nothing this week until something interesting happens again...But I was actually planning on doing my CAPP hours this week and call Mrs. English about them tomorrow, and maybe my college research as well. Anyway, that's all now...gonna let my fingers relax and soak my footsies in water...ahhh...

peace.

"event","Heeheehee...this is fun! I'm picking out a/some present(s) for Joni's birthday on Amazon.com. She's prolly the simplest friend that I have to shop for! ^.^ Not to say that <i>she's</i> simple though, it's almost the opposite. She's so complex and has such a diverse interest palette that I could almost get her anything and she'd love it! Heehee...Which is really quite the opposite to, say, Bjorn, whose main interests include all things Wiccan/Pagan, boys, and alcohol, which, obviously, leaves me with a limited range of possible birthday/Christmas/whatever-kind-of-special-holiday presents which doesn't involve buying a prostitute or committing a provincial felony.

Ooohhh...thunder...which reminds me that we actually had quite a downpour this afternoon; the first one since July 16th, actually, which is quite a relief after such a long drought. Nice and fresh-smelling outside.

Anyway, I'm looking all over Amazon to find some books/CD's/whatever that would tickle Joni's fancy, and I found a few items, a few thingamajiggers, that I believe she would truly enjoy. But then, I got to thinking, aren't the mainstream gift items, e.g.. books, CD's, whatever, I mean, aren't they a little unthoughtful and uncreative? Look at some of the gifts that some adults give each other: huge, amazing and showy presents that they obviously put quite a bit of thought and care into, and look at me: searching over the Internet for something that requires little or no brainwork for some get-done-quick scheme. *Sigh* I just don't think I've matured enough for that, perhaps...she'll probably like it anyway, I hope.

Rock and no water and the sandy road
The road winding above among the mountains
Which are mountains of rock without water
If there were water we should stop and drink
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
If there were only water amongst the rock
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit
There is not even salience in the mountains
But dry sterile thunder without rain
There is not even solitude in the mountains
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
From doors of mudcracked houses...""</i>

Had an interesting night last night...not so much <i>this</i> night though...my parents and I went out to the reservoir at around 6ish to hang out by the lake and watch the sun going down and such. It was fun, though. They had a specific spot all figured out that we went to a few years ago, but we passed by it a few times before we actually found it...there's a LOT of off-trail roads that lead off of the highway in practically all directions, so it was actually pretty difficult, but once we made it alive down that <i>steep</i>, rocky hill they call a road, it was really quite nice. I had my dinner down there, and while my dad went swimming in the tepid water (at least tepid compared to the Begbie Falls water that comes DIRECTLY from its source, which I believe is a glacier or something), I went wading out a long ways down the rocky and vegetated shores. Really really nice area, y'know. So while we were doin' our thing, Lucca (our 11 year old Springer Spaniel) starts going <i>nuts</i> and barking her fuckin' head off at this piece of driftwood which was echoing off throughout practically the entire valley. o.O So we checked it out, and she didn't even want to touch it she was so freaked out by it. So as soon as I touched it, she just kinda looked at it for a moment, sniffed it, and walked away to somewhere else, most likely because she had just realized that she had made a complete ass of herself by barking at a piece of wood. It was pretty understandable, though, cuz it appeared that someone had drilled a couple of holes into it that made it look like it had eyes, which always seems to freak her out. It was just kinda funny.
Anyway, it was nice and all, and I still have not completed ONE of my many goals for the summer. Hooray for me! Although I'm planning on doing my CAPP hours this week, then do my research next week, then the bike trip, then  my L, and work on my story between. I swear. Really. I'm serious. Oh, right, and I was actually supposed to meet Laura for, what, the second time this summer to watch a movie at her house tonight and see her newly designed room. Plans didn't go through, I'm getting over it, yadda yadda. I was looking forward to it though...guess I kinda deserve it...*shrugs*
That's all. Think I'll do something much more interesting tomorrow...no, I mean today. I swear.

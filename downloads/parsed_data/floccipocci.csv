As a prerequisite of my new job, I'll be going away to Malaysia for some outdoor training course. 21 days of Hiking, Kayaking in the open seas (3 day expedition I think), Solo camp (3 days alone in the jungle), survival course, mountain climbing.

Well, it should be fun and would be over very soon."

"event","Today I met up with C san.

We were supposed to meet at Plaza Singapura. I arrived early so I went to the arcade to play more ghost squad. And sent sms to C san where to find me. Strangely, she never replied and was very late.

It was only when I was going out of the arcade, when I received an sms from my gf that C san forgot her handphone and would want me to look for her at Starbucks.

I was very surprised, because my girlfriend is in Japan, and how could C san tell her that she forgot her phone? I thought that she probably used someone else's phone, but global sms??

Anyway, I waited at Starbucks for Csan. Then I had a call from her, asking me to wait for her at Starbucks.

I told her that I was already waiting, but Csan took some time to arrive. I turned around and found her talking to some guy who was taking surveys. Csan seemed very happy talking to him, so I thought that I'll wait some more and not disturb her.

It was only after 15 minutes that I got impatient (what a long survey!), that I went over to see what was going on (I know that it's another insurance agent thing). Anyway, Csan left with the insurance guy over to Macdonald's, so I trailed them.

I talked to C, and made fun of her, saying that she looked like she's enjoying herself so much, talking to such a good looking guy, that I did not want to disturb her. She said that she had no choice because she had to borrow his phone! Hahah, and she felt obliged to listen to him, and had to go through the entire process. So all the while we were waiting for the guy to finish printing some papers on his mobile printer we were complaining how slow he was, right in front of him and his group. We were also amazed that these are engineering students actually, doing part time insurance sales!

Haha, right in front of them, we were talking about how slow things are, me joking to Csan about 15 minutes of her enjoyment of sales talk, etc etc. While maintaining friendly happy faces. Hahah.

We had late lunch / early dinner at Carl's Jr, large burgers they are, we took about 1 - 2 hours to finish eating. I realise I cannot even eat so much any more.

Later, we had to go to City Hall, Raffles City. Csan talked to me about how Sanae likes guys who wear specs.

We later had coffee at some coffee shop overlooking the Swissotel. There was a pianist playing at the lobby. I told Csan that I can probably do that too.

Anyway, the conversation concluded that I should wear spectacles, wear a suit and play the piano, and then my girlfriend will like me more.

Haha, anyway, I got Csan to talk more about that local guy she once dated, and had a horrible time with.

Hang on a second, if Csan forgot her phone, how can she remember my number to call me?

===

Anyway, today my girlfriend is working very late, so she'll be home at around midnight, Japan time."

But amazing thing is that she ends up waking up in the middle of her sleep to reply to me, and then after that, she's back asleep. Just when I was thinking that she probably fell asleep when she does not reply to my message for more than 15 minutes... then she replies.

I don't want to disturb her, or make her lack sleep. Told her to go to bed early without waiting for me, since she has to wake up early for her work.

She's so cute. Anyway, I shall not disturb her."

I wonder why people like cancelling appointments at the very last moment.

Luckily I have not stepped out of the house, or else I'll be doing nothing the whole day.

I am reminded of those many times I spent entire days waiting at the studio because the bloody people are not coming. I tried calling them and they don't pick up their phones. Then the next day they come back and apologize, hoping that you will give them another studio slot at their own convenience.

I think these people should compensate."

Last night was dinner with csh san, yuri san and sunny at arab st. ate shish kebab. then we had beer, and after that, we went clubbing at MOS. once again, i went clubbing with 3 girls. :/ earlier that day, the 3 of them were shopping at bugis. sanae msg me wishing the evening would come quickly. did not know what she meant until then. ""until then""... is that the right phrase? i find it hard to switch easy between english mode and japanese mode. the languages are backwards of each other.

anyway, at the end, sanae and i left csh san and yuri san at the dance floor. 

that's when lots of guys started hitting on them, while sanae san and i watched from a balcony. and at the same time, the two of them wondering where we have gone to.

sanae said it must be because i'm finally gone, so that's why the guys are hitting on them. it was humourous to see the pathetic attempts of the guys trying to... i don't know how to say it, trying to get their hands on them during dancing? hahah, especially on yuri san, she's a television reporter or announcer, i think.

it's funny how all these westerner guys stereotype japanese girls to be so easy. that's only in anime, manga, movies and porn! hahahahahahahhah. bloody hell japanese girls are a lot of headache, and they're evil, selfish beings, you won't understand them, they scheme so they have their own code words and language. just like any girl. they only look easy because THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE IN ENGLISH. so one would think they are... overwhelmed? by one's charm and etc whatever, or they seem naive and innocent. hell, hearing the 3 of them discuss ""things"" makes me very feel.. shock and awe and embarrassment!

in the end, csh san adn yuri san finally got to know what is going on, and i think they saw both of us up on the balcony kissing or something. it was 3am, i think, they decide to go home, but sunny wanted to stay with me.

so we had coffee, walked or something and sat and talked at the river side until sunrise. it was around 7am when we left.

poor sunny, she's gonna be teased by csh san. oh my gosh, the... kind of text messages csh san sent to her phone last night! that's my i turned off mine... especially since csh san, who is like my older sister, is gonna tease me more about me and her best friend. whahah. but we don't care. i have advantage. since wanting to know more details, going to make csh san crazy. hahwahahahahhahahahhahah.

anyway, my mind right now is going ""oh shit i think i have a girlfriend?!""

i need to teach her english."

Well, I don't like karaoke, so i decided not to go. I was having a nap. So I did not know about the above situation until Sanae san called me. So I came down late and took her out for the rest of the day, until she has to go to sentosa to meet some friends who are having drinks.What a pity, if I knew that there's no karaoke session, I would have come down and get the chance to go out with her!

Well, Sunny does not drink much actually, she's not good with alcohol, so she's just gonna go down to meet some more of her japanese friends.

I bought a box of chocolates from SIN, at Centerpoint, which I will give to CSH san in appreciation for the troublesome matters she had to go through. That is where I have to meet up with Csh san, Snae san and Nakashma san, and others. While Csh san and Nkasima san were shopping, I brought Sanae san to buy prepaid cards which she will use during her stay here.

Sanae san was kind enough to get me to sit down and drink lots of water and coffee to sober up, before I bring her to buy the card. She got me a handphone accessory, it's a miniature rubber kendoka (kendo guy), with a shinai (bamboo sword)! It's quite cool, and cute too. After buying the prepaid card, we went shopping at hereen, and she bough a small bag. Said that she forgot to pack her bags in the luggage, so she got a loan bag from csh san.

Evening, we (4 of us) met a few more folks. We had dinner. and then we drank some more. I think I drank 2 jugs equivalent again. marco mentions that I have become slimmer, and it inspires him to try to be the same. he looks like he gained weight.

Oh wow.

But I still prefer Peter Friedman (that Grammy Nominee for Broadway guy). I did not even know it was him, until he left. All I did was some practice tracks for 2 songs of his new musical in New York anyway, but he seems to be a nice guy.

It seems like I am not really aware of famous people or something.

We ate at hooters. Giri and Frances had this slightly burnt chicken chop thingie with mushroom sauce and pasta, sort of like kway teow. I had this grilled fish thingie with chips. The blue cheese dipping was very nice. We also had 10pcs of chicken wings, but I think it was a scam, because they only had 5 chicken wings which they cut into twos, to make ten. The hot sauce was not even hot.

I also had a pitcher of Tiger beer which we shared. Feroz joined us later, but he already had dinner so he did not eat.

We tried going to iguana, but it was crowded as usual. So we ended up at Crazy Elephant, but the waitress seemed to have forgotten our order for beer and margarita, so we left.

Lots of things happened today! I just finished mixing a music album of 14 songs, mastered, and going to be sent for pressing.

For celebration my boss bought me about 4 mugs of beer. I also met his friend (again) who comes from this famous old local band.

Then his friend invited me for drinks, said that he had a bottle of whiskey at a pub down the road from my work place. We finished about 2/3 of it. Jack Daniels or something I cannot remember.

Then I was drunk and walked alone for about 1 kilometer or so to the studio, drank some chinese tea to sober up, and discussed plans about this band I want to produce. Stayed for about 2.5 hours. I want to stay overnight to save on cab fare. But.. oh well, decided I need my bed.

"event","Today was not interesting. But I got to meet someone new.

I had dinner at this nice old (being rude) lady's house. Thought it's just going to be her family and me. I found later that she invited all her ex-secretaries over for dinner.

So that's when I got to meet this girl. She's quite tall. Taller than me.

Later in the evening I was supposed to go to esplanad* to watch this band play at the W*terfront outdoor theater. She was supposed to meet her friend for a movie in town.

Dinner took sometime and she was going to be late, so I asked her if she would want to share a cab with me to town, since I'll be passing by the cinema on my way.

Yeah, so we left together. Got to talk to her some more in the cab. She works for some modelling agency as a sale representative or something like that. Not surprising, I guess, the way she looks.

Got her number.

So I reached Esplanade, and I was just in time to hear the last 4 songs of the band's act. Yes I purposely came late. Dinner was very good (great cooking! I'm learning too), and of course some unexpected event mentioned above.

But the feeling at watching the band!

It's like watching your little baby grow up. Some colleagues from the studio were there. I met up this guy from a old band, that was quite well known too.

Tonight I feel a little bit insignificant. Yes, I know many people, and I have many contacts and all that, but no matter how many I know, I still feel that I have yet to do something big. I want to do something I really have been wanting to do. I thought so hard on my way to train station, and on my way home.

...So I am planning on producing an album. A band. With two girl vocals. I have the resources!

...Crap, I'm in the wrong country sometimes I feel that way."

It was not my plan to do so. Last night, I had a recording session, it ended around 7pm, and I expected to just go out for drinks and then go home.

I don't like to type anymore.

So... in summary, it happened that I end up being part of an all-girl's night out group (Not that many. Only 3 of them). They booked a hotel room at (some hotel I purposely forget the name), then I took them to Ministry of Sound (Singapore) to club and have drinks, dance. Then accompanied them back.

BUT LET'S FORGET THE ABOVE AND GO ON THE OTHER HAND.... I got to meet my VJ and DJ friends at MoS!

More free drinks for me! I had a jug of beer, 1 Vodka Orange, 1 Vodka Lime, 1 Bourbon coke, 1 Dirty Snowball, and some more that I cannot remember their names. I also cannot remember what I actually really drank because we kept mixing up our glasses.

But I looked like shit. I never planned to go clubbing. So I was not mentally and physically prepared.

I woke up at 10am. Only 4 hours sleep. I have no hangovers (because of no wine). I have a recording session at 2pm.

I just finished my session an hour ago. I'm so tired. But I cannot sleep.

Yes, an old man who wanted to get his job back from a taxi company. He went to a MP in a ""Meet the people"" session for some kind of help, and punched him. Probably because his request could not be approved. It was all in the news, and people talked about it online.

It inspired one of my colleagues to write a song. The title is ""Old Man Buddha-palmed an MP Song"". About 1 minute long. It's so funny! The first verse was in English. But the second verse in chinese was funny. It's like one of those lectures you get from elderly when you have not shown respect to them. You know, stuff like ""I ate more rice than you ever did"" kind of things.

The incident also made someone post a screen shot of the buddha palm mark on the ground which is shown at the end of Stephen Chow's ""Kung Fu"" movie.

We had a discussion, and agreed that if we were old one day, we will have guts to do such things. This is because probably we have nothing to lose when we're that old."

"event","Let me tell you about the 7th month, or the Hungry Ghost Festival.

It's like Halloween you know, but on the 7th month of the Chinese calendar. As you can see, this 'festival' is 'celebrated' by the chinese. I don't know if I use the right words. Believed that on this month, the ghosts of the dead (eh... who else?) get to come back to earth and roam around, as the gates of hell are opened.

So currently, lots of people are burning paper offerings everywhere. So you burn these paper things, and they are in the form of money (hell money), clothes, cars, houses, cellphones, etc. And they materialize for your dead relatives to use... in the afterlife. So I guess, if no one cares about you, and don't send you stuff in the afterlife, you live a miserable afterlife?

If I am right, the taoists (religion) do these things.

But i have some questions:

1) Why hell? Is there heaven?
2) OK. So hell is not the kind of hell christians would believe, but just a name for a place you go to when you die. But if it is somewhat a mirror of the world we live in (in terms of needs and wants and material possessions), would it be hellish?
3) What if your family line died out. What will happen to your life in hell if you don't get presents from the living?
4) So maybe it's your chance to come back to earth and loot stuff?
5) Man, I lived a crappy life, and my afterlife will still be the same rat race?

Well... just for your information, the chinese I'm talking about are Singaporean chinese. Not China chinese. Today I had a talk with a friend from China (who stays in the studio). Religion in China right now seems to be almost unheard of, since the cultural revolution (if I am correct).

Another thing, it's weird how people know religion based on it's culture. What I mean is, most people out there think of this: religion = culture.

I think it's a wrong idea. I think culture are actually habits, that are present in many people, for a long period of time. Religion on the other hand, is a study/presentation of the spiritual or non-earthly beliefs.

Here's a example. Everyone has been bowing for thousands of years, culturally, it means respect. You bow to a diety, your culture of respect presents a form of avenue to show respect to that diety. You believed that the diety will give you wealth. Your cultural habit of bowing to your parents every time you need money from them, would hopefully translate the same for that diety. You bow. Parents feel respected. Parents therefore feel happy. Parents give you money freely. Same otherwise same.

Another example. A certain area of a country has been using song and dance (let's call this theatre, some way), for entertainment for centuries. Now we have christian missionaries. They believe such acts are pagan, or whatever. But they adopt this culture of theatre, and made it 'holy' by using theatre to present bible stories. So the villigers get to be presented to the religion in a form that they are comfortable with (that is, theatre that they have been seeing for centuries). So, many years down the road, this culture of art becomes part of the religious culture.

What I mean is, the music is not religion, but a cultural tool for religion.

So, people adapt and adopt cultural items into their religion. Of course it does not happen in one day. It takes years, I guess.

So... I guess most people are scared/bored/humored/etc by religion, because of the cultural acts that are associated to them.

So, there is only one Christmas, one Hari Raya (can't remember the actual name), etc, but people from different parts of the world celebrate differently. Hm!

Now imagine a religion based on the culture of war? Actually there are many. Not gonna talk about them.

But enough! It's not just about religion. It can be about film, music, business plan, games, anything. Think!"

""Listen...you don't wanna do that, okay?  You don't wanna do that.""
""I'm gonna...there's so many fuckin' reasons why I don't even need to be here anymore.  I'm gonna put a slug in my fuckin' head!""
""You don't wanna do that, you wanna be here on earth, okay?""
""Fuck that shit man, I got a gun right now and I got it right under my chin man, fuck that!  I'm gonna fuckin' blow my head all over the ceiling!  Fuck this shit man!""
""Hey...talk to me, okay?""

It ain't no point to me wakin' up
Everybody's time I'm takin' up
I got nobody, it ain't a shoulder near
I can't stay here and it's colder there
I don't wanna look back cuz it's gonna hurt
I slice my wrist and it's gonna squirt
For me, everybody holds a hate
I get backstabbed and everybody holds a stake
There's no roads to take, I'm in a circle drive
Bustin' at myself and I'm tryin' to survive
I'll disappoint you, and I will let you down
And I ain't got many homeboys coming around
You don't understand so don't say you do
I swear I'll put a motherfuckin' slug in you
I'm the only one, the lonely one
At home alone, loading a gun
Thinkin', why not?

""Why not?  What do you mean why not?  Okay, look, you  have feelings inside your head, okay?  I understand that.  Feelings lead to depression. When you have depression, you have a lonely void inside of your heart, okay?  And your heart means everything to the world.  Okay?

I got court comin' up, I stole a truck
I got a bitch pregnant and I'm broke as fuck
I wanna get high, but I got piss-test
I'm always first name on top of shit-list
Get this: the witch has made my chest
It's permanent nightly visiting nest
It ain't no clothes that I look good in
I'm the motherfuckin' big red train that couldn't
I got no family, I stole they shit
Restraining orders and I still won't quit
I hit rock bottom and then I fell in a hole
And then I fell thru the floor of that hole some more
I been missin' for a year, nobody's looking
I got beat down and my shit tooken
I look ahead and all I see is more of the same
Or this self inflicted bullet hole pourin' my brain

""Ooookay...I understand that you're in pain, okay?  I understand everything you're going thru, I've been there myself, okay?  Now...your pain is my pain, alright?  And I feel your pain, and I wanna be your friend.  Just me and you...friends.""

I dream about cuttin' heads off with a shovel
The dreams are gettin' serious, think I'm in trouble
I don't hold memory for more than an hour
I'm tired as fuck and I'm drained of power
I ain't halfway there and I'm all out of time
I'm like a crushed lightbulb: all out of shine
I been around the world and no place is home
I wanna see the other side when I face this chrome
I'm butt naked, I been jackin' off, gettin' drunk
It's my last hours alive, who gives a fuck?
It don't matter, I'm doin' this shit in the garage
Tryin' to make it easier for them to clean my head splash
This bitch I loved, I hope she finds me
Still up in a chair with my thoughts behind me
I'm bout to do it! ""No-""
*beep*
Can you hold for a second?
""Wait a min-"""

Walked into a Super K and went to the back
Started asking questions, checked out the chainsaw rack
They had a test model, I pulled the cord and got it runnin'
Turned the blade on the kid workin' and blood started gunnin'
What the fuck am I doin'?, I dropped the shit and started cryin'
I made it down aisles before some hero clotheslined me
I got up, grabbed a shovel, and stabbed him in the gut
I pulled it out and hammered it across the back of his nug
I hear sirens goin' off, it's no blue light specials
I turned murderer, taking in the daily life pressures
But fuck that, now all y'all gonna know me
See me on TV bein' like, ""Look, there go my homie""
I'm more than lonely and lost, lives are the cost
I just beat some bitch in the head, stabbed her twice and took off
They can't find me, I'm hidin' in a flannel coat rack
I jump out and attack and put a gash in your neck
I finally made it to the front door and to the parking lot
That's when I got shot a lot, I got got.
Police with bullets and more bullets, pluggin' me deep
I'm seein' flashes, hearing screaming, and it's all over me
See a crowd of people being held behind the police tape
All watching me die, I think I made no mistake
I finally got some recognition, dying on my knees
Ready for hell because compared to my life, it should be an ease

Nice and easy....a cake walk....I'm ready..."

FUCK YOU TOO.
and we were NOT purposely trying to blow you off.i'm sorry if we all have lives outside of each other and other friends as well.and again,you never told us that you thought we were blowing you off.AGAIN,your fault for not telling us what you were thinking.we're not fucking mind readers,we don't have these huge inflated egos that we think we can do all things,when we know we can't.(for the intellectually challenged,i'm saying that we don't act like you,and how you claim that you're better at alot of things than other people.)

and you wanted to correct my wrong date on my live journal,so i decided to help you out and correct every little thing wrong with this journal entry.i would do it for your whole journal,but that would take WAY too long,so i'll just do it for this entry. okay,here we go...

They're talking about me, but they do it to they friends
Cause they all afraid of what's gonna happen in the end
Now my ears keep ringing only meaning that the Devil sings
And preys on broken wings
I'm not a new thing. consumated out of faith
I've been assembled and created by all of the things you hate
I'm uncontrollable but still I get the last laugh
I got your president's head inside my garbage bag
Be alarmed everybody cause the bird's out
My last warning was last year, the words out
I take revenge of the american mute
And fire bomb on your campaign boost from house roots
And that's the truth as only Twiztid can tell
Make sure it's all covered cause the world is Hell

The world is Hell
I'm hearing what you're saying
But you're faking all that hoping and staying as if its changing
The world is Hell
But change must come from within
Speaking your mind is that another sin from within?


Let's begin with the way that we act death and destruction
Lies, with an axe killing is a function
Taught by the world that they're better than the mind
That through television to the age of 9 is solidified
Little time bombs just waiting to explode
On the whole world turning the world into a hole
And it's your fault so many young are dumb
And turn to drugs and be like ""fuck an education""
The homeless starving, strung out and dying
Eating out of garbage cans barely surviving
A lost generation
Stuck somewhere between the real
And the mind and imagination
Some call it Hell
Living life everyday, maybe this is Hell
Evil's everywhere and anyway if you're good you'll go to Heaven
And if you're not you'll be destined to stay alive till the year 2057


The world is Hell
I'm hearing what you saying
But you're faking all that hoping and staying as if its changing
The world is Hell
But change must come from within
Speaking your mind is that another sin from within?


What's the price of betrayal? Pushing D12 through Hell
Time'll tell if I'm nailed to a cross like Christ
Murder's on the mind of many mothafuckas at night
Stevie Wonder wouldn't wanna see the shit that's in sight
The World is Hell, the day the Twin Towers fell
The day the Titanic set sail, the anthrax mail
But who you gonna tell? Nobody's listening nitro-glycerin
Pistols popping and bullet's whistling, the music's twisted
Helluva heavenly, for ever but don't miss it
The World is Hell, two blocks away from where I sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep, my soul the angel's they keep
The World is Hell... The World is Hell...


The world is Hell
I'm hearing what you're saying
But you're faking all that hoping and staying as if its changing
The world is Hell
But change must come from within

If there's shit going down would they hustle for you? 
Tell me, if you get outnumbered and the tables switch, 
Are you the type to leave them all hanging, and run like a bitch? 


Run away boy,run away boy, hurry up,run away boy, run away boy, hurry, run away boy, run away boy, hurry up, run away boy, run away boy, HURRY! 
(RUN!) 
Hurry boy go run and hide your ugly face 
Hurry boy now run away where you can be safe 
Hurry boy now run away, hope they dont give chase 
Hurry boy just leave your friends, you need to be safe 
(don't worry about them) (let them come to us) 

Give me a tap, heh 
I see that we down 
But would you hold your ground if there was trouble around? 
If muthafuckas dissing are you pissing in your pants or are you jumping in the mix like c'mon and dance? 
Tell me this, would you take a bullet for me? 
Do you have pride, tell me would you show it for me? 
Or would you throw it to me, jump in your car and bail, 
Like see ya would'nt wanna be ya pal"

Hidden and you're never gonna see 
I'm cold 
Forgiven all because of my beliefs 
I'm no 
Body that you ever wanna be 
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me 

[Monoxide Child]
Now you can try to sedate me, 
Assassinate or just hate me 
But there's nothing that you can do to me lately 
Now I'm greatly accepted 
In my mind cause I'm confused and intertwined 
From being rejected so many times,
I wanna leave it all behind 
So kind of you to pick up the album and give it a try for once 
And run and tell your homies that these motherfuckers will die for us 

So many questions, 
fingers pointing for answers 
Suggesting that I'm the cancer that lingers inside the pasture 
With green grass, up to my neck in situations
But its too fast To think about it, 
most people can't dream about it
A hundred million miles and every single second 
And every time you hear this record I want you to feel me on every sentence 
Reminisce from descendants of past treasures 
We'll embark on a journey that'll stay alive forever 
Plus I would stand over on my side of the fence 
Regardless of the circumstances or the consequences 

[Chorus x2]
I'm so 
Hidden and you're never gonna see 
I'm cold 
Forgiven all because of my beliefs 
I'm no 
Body that you ever wanna be 
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me 

[Jamie Madrox]
I am my own worst enemy 
I'm not the smartest motherfucker and shit, 
I don't pretend to be 
And why I am the way I am is not a mystery 
My mind's not in proper working order or in therapy 
Duranged, confused and mentally abused 
Life's been hanging on a string so what the fuck I got to loose? 
And what the fuck I got to prove to you? 
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know me 
You can put that on my real homies 
I got problems and they stack like bills 
And I related to the broken, bleeding heart love killed 
And I awaited in the shadows, awake in the dark 
Hoping to talk to the passed on, I'm falling apart 
I'm such a mess and decisive, I'm fading away 
I'm out of touch with society and living today 
Never relied on my sanity, I through it away 
To become the maniac that's got your attention today 


I'm so 
Hidden and you're never gonna see 
I'm cold 
Forgiven all because of my beliefs 
I'm no 
Body that you ever wanna be 
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me 


Can you keep a secret? 
Well I'm afraid world because they want me to die, can you believe it? 
But I'm still alive... and been floating since '95 
With my chin held high but I'm so dead inside 
Let the problems just roll off my back into a pile 
Because it's just a bunch of shit that I can't deal with right now 
And I'm tired of always guessing and messing it up again 
And the next day it's even deeper and I'm steady sinking in 


I took a look at myself and came to grips with what I found 
It was a vision of a child, disturbed and broke down 
No soul, no heart because I gave it away 
No time for feeling sorry, I'll grieve another day 
And all those tears are stored in storm clouds 
That hover above me and cover the ugly 
Continued to haunt me when I was feeling low 
That's the same reason I hold on and never let go 


I'm so 
Hidden and you're never gonna see 
I'm cold 
Forgiven all because of my beliefs 
I'm no 
Body that you ever wanna be 
Cause I know that the world is afraid of me"

Artist(Band):Twiztid
(Print the Lyrics)


I Don't Care Lyrics

(feat. Insane Clown Posse)

People say I talk too much
I don't care I talk too much
Momma say I failed in life
I don't care I failed in life
Daddy says I drink too much
I don't care I drink too much
People say I'm headed nowhere
And I don't fuckin care
Jimmy Johnson's gonna die
Sarah Suzie's gonna die
Everybody's dying slow
I don't give a fuck though
I'm only short like fifty bucks
I couldn't give fifty fucks
I could really use some help
You can go and fuck yourself
Everybody's gonna die
Terror fallin' from the sky 
Mothers with they children cry 
And I could give a fuck why
They say you'll never walk again
Well go plug the Sega in
I think somebody stole my truck
Tell someone who gives a fuck
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
How much do they charge in there? 
Wait a minute, I don't care
I'ma shoot you in the face 
I'll tell you how the bullets taste
Critics say you immitate 
I don't give a fuckulate
50 million people dying 
Awwwww I'm crying
Tell me all the things you saw 
As if I give a fuck at all
You see me sittin in the chair 
People dying even there
Everything you saying to me 
Shhhhh, go right through me
If I was to pick it up 
I'd have to give a fuck, and I don't
I don't care nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' for you
I don't care nothin' bout it
Rainforest burning down
War and riots all around
I'm inside like fuck 'em all
What's the main event on RAW?
Posion, mad cow disease
Can I get that with double cheese?
STD's steady spreadin'
Bareback up in this neden
I don't care
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
I don't care nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' for you
I don't care nothin' bout it
Everyday when I wake up
All I really wanna do is die
And go to the next phase
Ground up flesh is consumed
Everyone is gonna die...
Fuck I ain't afraid to die
Go on shoot me in the eye
Do it see if I survive
Give it to me point blank
Better ""BANG!""
Did you hit 'em? 
Yes, and I don't give a fuck less
Careful it's a dark night 
Give your money or your life
Take 'em both for all I care
Dump your bullets right here
If you notice on the door
Addicted crawlin' on the floor
Ask me did I ever care?
Nah...
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care"

"event","All I ever wanted was, I don't want a lot
All I ever wanted was a, job that I never got
All I ever needed, no one ever cared
All I ever wanted was, someone take me outta here


All I ever wanted was for me to be a myth
Hidden from the land of the bliss
I'm constantly dissed and pissed off
My mind frame's shackled to the floo'
And I can't move even a little (Bitch)
All I ever wanted was a noose to hang from
And to show all of you bitches, where I came from
The Carnival is comin', you can see it in my eyes
Screamin' at the top of my lungs, ""I wanna die!""
You couldn't see it wit' ya glasses on
Without a witness, doin' dirt all by my lonely and then I'm gone
All I ever wanted was to flip the script
You pull a gat on me, and I'mma break both your arms, bitch
Eastside represented by the killas
Drug dealers, (put ya hands up if ya feel us)
And I don't give a fuck about you bitches spreadin' hate
(Why?) Cuz most of you hoes'll be dead in 28


All I ever wanted, lemme kick back and reminisce
Only a few things I can think of on my list
A new meat cleaver wit' an edge like a razor
And a windpipe connected to a hater (Ha!)
It's all I ever wanted, I ain't askin' for much
A handle with an axe at the end of my clutch
And then swing it down with all that I got
Into the ground and grip the ? hot
CHOP!
Hatchet riders & juggalos come wit' us
We ? told the otherside the fuck up
Douse a bitch wit' gas and fling the matches
I got somethin' for all they asses
Listen to 'em all, pleadin' for they life
Talkin' 'bout they were wrong and always knew we were right
Light the Mol-E-Tov, Aaaah!, BOW!
All we ever wanted starts happenin' now!


All I ever wanted was a chance to shine
Wasn't askin' for much, I just wanted mine
I don't even have a clue what went wrong
I jus' knew I wouldn't let this shit fly for long
Tell me somethin', who the fuck you laughin' at?
What the fuck you thinkin'? Don't you see this bat?
Tell me what the hell is stoppin' me from crackin' ya dome
>From smackin' ya dome 'til it ooze like foam
All I ever wanted was an eye for an eye
I'mma taste your soul when I swallow it live
Turn around, wasn't lookin', diggin' in your locker
Soon as you looked up, WHACK, that's when I got ya
Crack, smack, kept rackin' in ya end
Kept thumpin' ya skull until it finally caved in
It looked like spaghetti in a broken bowl
I guess I lost control, that's all I ever wanted though


All I ever wanted was to scare you to death
Choke your fuckin' neck until your ass is outta breath
All I ever wanted was to hear you scream
Ya know it's hard to sleep when you're controlled by ya dreams
The man in the mirror knows that vanity's a must
But will he understand and become like one of us?
Paintin' up his face, not givin' a fuck
Grabbin' his nuts and expectin' bad luck
All I ever wanted was a brand new axe
Strictly for the purpose of choppin' and splittin' backs (BITCH)
All I ever wanted was to watch you bleed
For the cause of the underground in which I believe
I'm the maniac, (yeah), but you don't understand
My axe keeps swingin' like blades on ceiling fans
I can show you everything that you can't see
That all I ever wanted to be was just me"

Die nigga, die nigga



Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street


Burning in hell, but don't deserved to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
It's because they heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be poppin, robbin and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From Ohio to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', a 129
Up the school street cuz I come through mine
Barking my dogs, get at me nigga
arf arf arf
Get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
Then come for the star 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo




I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
Cuz I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go
Feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart cuz it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' getcha
With the steal, what you don't know is gon' splitcha
I can blaze tracks
Make niggas play raps and raise stacks
Paybacks a bitch, didn't you used to say that
Play around in dirt, you get mud
Cuz you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real


I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time soldier eighth done told us not to hate
But then it's out of state, and it's too late
For change is to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, that nigga's got to give me a place
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me away
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always his versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, cuz now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly



Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy
For real
Arf arf, arf arf arf

Look in my crystal ball it's alright

Come on in, welcome, my curious sisters and brothers
First, put a twenty in the jar with the others
(That's right, take a seat)
Ain't no smokin in here, I need to keep my ball clear
There's spirits in there
(Whats your future, someone gonna shoot ya?)
Will you get your girlfriend back, as if I know that
I can only tell you where your soul is headed
And will remain eternally embedded, the rest forget it
(Life is nothin but a test to clear)
Did you have a heart while you were here
And was it sincere?
Your still unravelling your future right now
What kinda person are ya bro? (oh, where do you go?)
You control your own muthafuckin' destiny
I aint lettin' the devil get the best of me
(I'mma make it into Shangri La) golden walls
Whats up with you check your own crystal ball
Lookin my crystal ball its allright
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright

Lookin in my crystal ball, I'm seein' thugs
Both catchin' and firin' slugs (paper for drugs)
I see a line waiting on block cheese a mile long
all tryin to be strong (It's the same old song)
But when I'm lookin' into everybody's faces (smile)
They souls are headed other places
And they ain't worried about payin' them dues down here
(Because they mother fuckin' future is crystal clear)
The focus switches to you and it ain't good
All mad cause someone rolls up out they neighborhood
Check your self, if judgment was passed
Yo, you'd be in hell (right up in the asshole)
The hatin' will get ya if ya let it, pack your speedo's
I hear it's hot where you headed
I'm trying to tell ya now (when the grim reaper calls)
You dont wanna be asked out grippin' your crystal balls

Lookin my crystal ball its alright
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright
Lookin my crystal ball its alright
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright

Look into my crystal ball its all black
And everybody's frozen in time front to back
They're controlled by the matrix of mind, body and soul
And I'm branded by the system of carnival freakshow
I see the pain and the lies cuz nothin' is disguised
It's as simple as me seein' the death in the demon's eyes
I'm hidin' my sight from the truth of my crystal ball
Believe me when I say that we comin' for all of y'all
Look deep into my crystal ball
See the dead smokin' on trees and drinkin' alchohol
Underneath the street beneath the concrete
If you listen to the night you can hear my heart beat
All painted up carryin' an axe and shit
Juggalo love got each others backs and shit
Encased in glass for the whole world to see
Am I inside, or is the crystal ball inside of me

Lookin my crystal ball its alright (8X)
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright
{*fades out*}

rain comes down (Lookin my crystal ball it's alright)
{*repeats until song ends*}"

Let me ask you this life we live 
And let me try to swerve some attention you give 
To them distant ass relatives over ham dinner 
If they really missed you so much, why don't they just call a (mutha fucka)? 
If you wasn't blood would you still have love 
Or in fact does the blood make you think you have to love? 
Look, I probably love my family more than anybody here, but my homies are family too, 3rd cousins get outta here 
Who was you with when you got tattooed? 
And who was you trippin' with when you did them mushrooms? 
And who the fuck threw up all over you car and then felt worse than you about the shit in the morning? 
Who loaned you money homie, who owes you cash? (WHO?) 
Who taught you how to use the bong for the grass? (WHO?) 
I don't know much, but I gotta assume 
When you hit your first neden, your homies was in the other room 


Chorus: (Forest Waters Warm - Pink Faygo - Happy Valentines Day - No Ones Looses No One We Promise) 
We talkin' about HOMIES HOMIES 
Talkin' about those dogs of mine 
Our mutha fuckin HOMIES HOMIES 
We throwin' up clown love signs 
Real Juggalo HOMIES HOMIES 
Talkin' about those dogs of mine

Have you ever had a job that you truly despise? 
Like I like don't know maybe dish washin', or fuckin' flippin' fries 
And you got this boss who think he the Don Mega, because he the head manager, Chief Chilli Fry Maker 
All you can vision is ya'll beating him down, your homies standin' on his back while you're kickin' his head around 
But responsibility is there, I can't lie though, I'd of been plucked his fuckin' eye ball out with a chicken bone 
I'm crazy as fuck, I'd rip your piercings off, and now my homies are holding me back so I don't look soft 
When you snuck the car out who did you get? (WHO?) 
And when you got caught, on who'd you blame the shit? (WHO?) 
Who can you relax around and scratch your balls? (WHO?) 
Homies, I'm talkin' about like you and yours 


Chorus: 
Violent J, Anybody Killa, and Juggalos: (Lavender Rain - She Loves You Real - Oshideous 2:12 - Roy Sota FX) 
You don't like me, you can fuck on! 
Carnival ain't for everyone! 
Keep it in your click fuck the outside baby 
You don't like me, you can fuck on! 
Carnival ain't for everyone! 
Runnin' with the homies until I'm old like Grady 


Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child of Twiztid: (Green Books, Green Skies, Green Waterfalls, Green Lives, 17 Green Times) 
Me and my homies stay tight like a noose and if you step to one of us, you better step the whole crew 
I never knew that I could depend, that I could have some friends, that's down to the very end 
Well that's my homeboys excuse me, my family, and when we conquer the world, we mackin' on the galaxy 
Cause the sky's the limit and we ain't finished, and if my homies gonna ride than you know I'm with it 
Puff it and pass it and I give it to my homies ya'll 
Hit it and quit it then I give it to my homies ya'll 
I got the world around my finger with my homies ya'll 
And everything is obsolete unless I hear my homies call 
We world wide with homies across the planet 
Stickin' together like zippers on a Micheal Jackson ""Beat It"" jacket 
They got my back like a tat, for that I love ya'll, hangin' till we old and gray like grandpas"

This world, this world is cold
But you don't, you don't have to go
You're feeling sad you're feeling lonely

Your mother's gone and your father hits you
This pain you cannot bare

But we all bleed the same way as you do
And we all have the same things to go thru

Hold on...if you feel like letting go
Hold on...it gets better than you know

Your days you say they're way too long
And your nights you can't sleep at all (hold on)
And you're not sure what you're waiting for
But you don't want to know more
And you're not sure what you're waiting for but you don't want to know more

But we all bleed the same way as you do
And we all have the same things to go through

Hold on...if you feel like letting go
Hold on...it gets better than you know

Don't stop looking you're one step closer
Don't stop searching it's not over...hold on

What are you looking for?
What are you waiting for?
Do you know what you're doing to me?
Go ahead...what are you waiting for?

How can I let the past be the past.
Once and for all take a hold of the future
And not let it control what I aspire to have.
I see where my decisions have brought me
What's done is done and it's time to start again
Can't let it tear me in two waste me away
I gotta believe 
Cause this is now
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today.
This is now
If I control myself I control my destiny. 
What I've seen and what I've been through has made me who I am
There was a time in my life where I had no desire to carry on
I couldn't see a place for me or a will to survive
I never thought to rely on myself or the beliefs that I have denied 
But this is now
How can I can change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now
If I control myself I control my destiny 
If I control myself I control my tomorrow
I got to change today
Cause this is now 
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today.
I must control myself if I 'm to control my destiny.

"event","i've done things i regret and i know i am going to do a lot more things i will regret but one thing i think i am not going to regret is when i stoped talking to matt and bob. the frist two or three days sucked  but i have been starting to feel happy it's been a long time sents i felt like this. the way i feel about my self has not changed. i wish it would but it not yet. i know a lot of people said i need help and i do and i am starting to look for it. i have made some promise to some people and i am going to try to keep them. i am going to end this with a quote from a song "" Now it is time for me to rise to my feet, Wipe the spit from my face, Wipe there tears from my eyes, I got to take my life back, One chance to make it right, I've gotta have my voice be heard and bring meaning to this life,  Cause i trusted for nothing.I've been led astray, I've been tried and tested BUT I WON'T ACCEPT DEFEAT, Now i've done things i regret and it's time to reverse the rolls, I just want to make good on the promise that i have made i will be heard"""

"event","Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine


When I'm hiding, when I need it,
it lets me breathe,
for our handle on this life, I don't believe
this time

Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again.....

Forever fooling, free and using,sliding down the slide that breaks a will
Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are you to regress unfulfilled?
It's a damn shame, but who's to blame?
Out of my mind,
gun up to the mouth
No pretension, execution, live and learn , rape and turn
Fret not family,
nor pre-judged army
This is for me,
and me only, cowards only
Try it


Don't you try to die, like me
It's livid and it's lies and makes graves
Graves descending down

It's not worth the time to try, to replenish a rotting life
I'll end the problem, facing nothing, fuck you off, fuck you all
Tortured history, addict of misery, this exposes me
for weakness is a magnet - watch me do it

(Chorus)

Why would you help anyone who doesn't want it,
doesn't need it, doesn't want your shit advice
when a mind's made up to go ahead and die?
What's done is done and gone, so why cry?


i am sick everone calling a big old teading bear that would not hurt a fly. calling me sweet careing and all that other bullshit. NO ONE KNOWS ME. i have no heart you have to love to have a heart witch i cann't love. so i am just fucking tired of all this shit in my life and i hope it ends soon."

"event","John Brown's Body is pretty much the best band you'll ever hear.&nbsp; Just thought I'd tell you that.&nbsp; To everyone I know in Rochester and Buffalo, you should go see them at the end of this month.&nbsp; I promise you won't be disappointed. I have one of their albums shared on AIM.  

So, wow.&nbsp;   Derek and Brenna broke up last night.&nbsp; I kinda feel bad about posting about it, but it's affecting me a lot more than it should.&nbsp; Like, they were Derek And Brenna, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember right before Brenna moved to Buffalo.&nbsp; She had come out to visit for a week or so and when she went back he told me ""I'm probably going to marry her"".&nbsp; I don't even know if he told anyone else that.&nbsp; From what I know this is only their second time having major problems, and they're too good to not be together, so I'm assuming they'll go their seperate ways for however long, and then realize that they need to be together for my sake, and that will be that.&nbsp; Derek, I love you.&nbsp; And your huge wang.    

So my boss wants me to be a boss (hooray!!).&nbsp; And today, her boss talked to me about being a boss (double hooray!!!!)&nbsp; And it might happen as soon as...a year (Boo!).&nbsp; But I can wait out a year.&nbsp; And a year is worst-case.&nbsp; Maybe I can start the program at the end of the summer.&nbsp; And by mid-spring, I can move ANYWHERE.&nbsp; I'm thinking Southern California.&nbsp; 2 of my best peoples are there.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; I have plenty of time to think about it.  

Ok, so apparently Sean and Teresa also broke up.&nbsp; What the fuck is going on?&nbsp; Who's next?&nbsp; Not be be selfish, but I had wedding outfits already planned out guys.&nbsp; Where am I going to wear these things now?&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of me!&nbsp; I was gonna scam major tail at these weddings.&nbsp; Now ::sigh:: ...I have 2 words: hook.ers.&nbsp; You happy?&nbsp; OK, that was kinda mean, but seriously everyone, stop breaking up.&nbsp; It makes you sad, which makes me sad, which SHOULD make you re-sad.&nbsp; So, stop breaking up.&nbsp; It sucks and you shouldn't have to go through it.  

So when Dr. Von Flushenheimer, or whoever, invented the urinal cake, I'm pretty sure they designed it with enough potentcy that one urinal cake would be adequate per urinal.&nbsp; Now, I don't know if the Greeks are bad at math (even though they invented trigonometry) or if they just don't understand other languages (Von Flushenheimer is cleary German), but they don't seem to think that way at all.&nbsp; They seem to think that at the Suffolk Diner in Centereach, NY you need eleven.&nbsp; 11!&nbsp; Eleven fucking urinal cakes in one stall.&nbsp; The 1:1 ratio was not acceptable to them and they said ""Fuck the Germans, I want 11 of those bastards in there.&nbsp; That'll learn 'em"".&nbsp; But really, was eleven urinal cakes that necessary?&nbsp; Guys in Centereach are grimy, but goddamn.&nbsp; And this is why I hate the Greeks.&nbsp; Goat cheese ::shakes head::  

Wow, this post sucks.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; Night, fuckasses."

"event","So, I definitely found a used urine sample drug test at work.  I'm doing an overnight, it's like 1:30 in the morning and I'm cleaning the bathroom.  Sweep--->mop--->mirror--->garbage....wait, something is amiss.  The little swinging door is being propped open by something.  So I reach in, pull it out, and it a urine sample cup.  I know this because the top said ""Urine Sample Cup"".  It also had a list of various drugs with three dots next to each name.  Whoever this person is was very drug free.  No MARI, or BARB, or COC, or AMPH.  Nothing.  This person was clean as a whistle (which I have NEVER understood.  Whistles are like spit traps that you can't drain.  Do you know how many nasty ass mouths have been on whistles, or how many times they've been dropped in the dirt, or if the person whistling brushed their teeth or not??  Clean as a whistle my ass.  More like clean as the skank ass ho blowing into it.), or at least their friend is.   Three nights later I found another one of the same cup.  This brings me to two conclusions: 1) Someone's on parole and their PO wants to meet at Starbucks to have them pee in a cup.  Or, 2) Some pothead douche is going to be getting drug tested for a new job and is screening which one of his friend's urine's is the best to use.  Either way, gross.

I love girls and they love me back.  No story.  Just wanted to say that.

Driving home the other night I was the only person on Sunrise [Highway] for 9 exits.  Literally the only pair of headlights for the whole span of time.  And this was around 11pm Saturday night.  Isn't that strange?"

"event","Tonight, on Middle Country Road, here in Selden, NY, someone hit a telephone poll at around 6pm.&nbsp; The result: no overnight shift for Kai!&nbsp; The inadvertent result: I'll be up all night because I slept all day in preparation for being up all night.&nbsp; Yayyyyyy!!&nbsp; Oh wait, that's nothing to be excited about.<br /><br />I've never thought of myself as a spontaneous person, but I had a conversation tonight that changed my mind.&nbsp; I tend to overthink things.&nbsp; If anything I consider that my character flaw (that and my large, large penis).&nbsp; To combat myself overthinking things I try not to think about things too much.&nbsp; Sometimes, it gets me onto trouble.&nbsp; But most times, it allows me to have fun, because I'm doing things on the fly.&nbsp; I have to say, I'm a fan.&nbsp; Because of my ""spontaneity"" I have [practically] gotten a tugjob on the dance floor at a major university, thwarted security and the NYPD by breaking into a different university, ridden the train for free in Buffalo for the entire summer of 2002, broken into and vandalized Islip middle or high school (I can't remember which one) after witnessing a robbery from the roof of the South Shore mall, hooked up at work, and done the dirty at my high school.&nbsp; See what happens when you don't overthink things?&nbsp; Sex and crime!<br /><br />So, starting April 1, I will no longer be one America's 46 million without health insurance.&nbsp; ::holds for applause::&nbsp; Yeah, I'm excited too.&nbsp; I've already called my PCP and made an appointment for...tadaa, April 1.&nbsp; I'm going to get every test done they have.&nbsp; Mumps, measles, rubella, herpes, prostate, pregnancy, alzheimer's, over-active bladder, EVERYTHING.&nbsp; I want to be fit for a diaphragm and everything.&nbsp; It's going to be marvelous.&nbsp; I'm going to walk out of that office with sore, swollen, puffy arms and it will be so sweet I'll probably get diabetes.&nbsp; But don't worry, I'm getting tested for that too ::wink::<br /><br />Ok, so last week I'm checking my mail (<a href=""mailto:yippiekaia@gmail.com?subject=Kai%2C%20I%27ve%20wanted%20to%20tell%20you%20this%20for%20years...&amp;body=I%20want%20your%20bone.%20%20BAD."">yippiekaia@gmail.com</a>) and all of a sudden everything starts flashing orange and I thought I broke Gmail.&nbsp; Turns out Google intergrated GoogleChat with Gmail so you can send IM's through your e-mail.&nbsp; It's incredible.&nbsp; Steve (I'd link his LiveJournal, but I don't think he has one) was the aforementioned IMer.&nbsp; I was so confused.&nbsp; Oh, and it does the coolest thing.&nbsp; In AIM you can send smiley's and they're all cute and what not, but in Gmail they're animated!&nbsp; They move!&nbsp; I sent a smiley face :) and it rotated 90 degrees clockwise.&nbsp; It was incredible.&nbsp; Then I sent a wink ;) and it also rotated, but then IT WINKED.&nbsp; I could not possibly express my enthusiasm through words, but let's just say I jizzed more in that 3 minutes than I have in the past year.&nbsp; Ok, maybe not the past year, more like the past 10 months ::wink::&nbsp; If you would like to get down with Gmail, I have 49 invitations left.&nbsp; It sure beats whatever crap e-mail you have.&nbsp; It winked people.&nbsp; WINKED!!<br /><br />P.S. Should I add a picture?  And if so, does anybody have any good pictures of me?<br /><br />And on that note, I'm out.&nbsp; Why? I have no idea, I'll be up until at least 7am.&nbsp; Meh.&nbsp; Night, bitches."

"event","I should read my friends page more.&nbsp; It's kind of hypocritical of me.&nbsp; I expect everyone to read my page,but I never, ever EVER read anyone else's.&nbsp; I should get on that.&nbsp; I just did a quick little scan, and in the past week Kiera has gotten all intelligent and verbose, Durin wishes this lady at work died, Katie Korb actually posted, Derek works for American Idol ::gag::, and Lindsay's depressed.&nbsp; The things you learn by clicking a simple link...<br /><br />I just watched <em>Sympathy for Mr. Vengance</em>.&nbsp; I Netflix'd it because I read in <em>Maxim</em> that the director is known for over-the-top gory movies.&nbsp; The first hour or so went by with nothing at all gory.&nbsp; It was confusing as all fuck, but not gory.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden, and guy starts slicing his own stomach open, you hear the sounds of an autopsy (twice), TWO people get their heads bashed in with baseball bats, a guy gets stabbed in the jugular with a screwdriver and pulls it out to cause the GREASTEST spray of blood I have ever seen, and for a grand finale, the protagonist gets his <font size=""-1"">Achilles tendons</font> sliced which forces him to crumple and drown in a 4-foot deep lake.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this in 45 minutes.&nbsp; And I left out all the suicides, drownings, battery torture, necrophilia, and other buttery goodness.&nbsp; Turns out that Chan-wook Park made a trilogy of sorts.&nbsp; Part II is in the DVD player waiting for me to come home tonight.&nbsp; Part III is in theaters May 5.<br /><br />Yesterday, I told someone that ""wonderousness"" is an actual word and believed that with every fiber of my being.&nbsp; I even looked it up.&nbsp; ::shakes head::<br /><br />So right this second I <u>think</u> I'm supposed to be at work.&nbsp; Jill Schombs asked if I could cover the last 2 hours of her party, I agreed (for $20 ::cha ching::) and that was that.&nbsp; Then she said we should just switch parties.&nbsp; Then she said she'd call to confirm.&nbsp; I gots no call, no IM, no nothing.&nbsp; So I decided that we switched.&nbsp; And since I haven't gotten a call from Craptain Bill's yet (see what I did there??) I assume that I assumed correctly.&nbsp; If not, I guess I'm fired.&nbsp; Darn..<br /><br />You know what's not delicious?&nbsp; Egg salad, especially in sandwich form.&nbsp; First of all, it's yellow and has chunks of white in it.&nbsp; Second...I don't know, it's just gross.&nbsp; I had one last night/this morning and SWEAR I could taste the diarrhea forming.&nbsp; Dramatic?&nbsp; Yes, but that's how fucking gross egg salad is.&nbsp; Now chicken salad... mmm mmm MMM!&nbsp; Mr. Platnick was correct, that shit is good.<br /><br />I should probably go shave now.&nbsp; I'm looking all sorts of hairy.&nbsp; Hairy=gross.&nbsp; In 10 or more minutes a clean-saven Kai will emerge onto society and bring joy into people's lives.&nbsp; And then I'll step inside Captain Bill's and want to murder everything I see.&nbsp; Ciao!<br /><br />I had a lengthly conversation yesterday with some ladies at work as to their initial thoughts of me.&nbsp; All three thought I was gay (surprise).&nbsp; And then I opened my mouth.&nbsp; And now one of the three has admitted (although I am not supposed to know this) to wanting ""it"" from me.&nbsp; And apparently the numbre rises everyday.&nbsp; I so win.<br /><br />Peace in the Middle East, y'all."

"event","This morning while at work, at 3:35am and 35 seconds, I tasted a Krispy Kreme donut.&nbsp; The weird part is I was straightening chairs, thinking about stuff, and there wasn't a single donut on the premises.&nbsp; I wasn't eating anything sugary, nor had I kissed anyone who recently had confections.&nbsp; The reason I know the exact time was because it was so random.&nbsp; I'm standing there and I started to smack my lips and feel happy.&nbsp; The taste was there, unmistakable.&nbsp; It was definitely a Kripy Kreme glazed donut, and day-old one, not one of the fresh-out-the-oven jammies.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea what it means.<br /><br />So I really like working at Starbucks.&nbsp; I do the overnights (mostly) so I don't get to deal with people too much, but I do get to spend 5-6 hours locked in a building with a co-worker.&nbsp; I really like all of them so far.&nbsp; Very friendly people, helpful, funny, and some are as perverted as me.  OK, never in a fapillion years, but you get the point.  &nbsp; The other day orgasms were discussed (I still haven't seen Darlene since then.&nbsp; That's not true, I saw her in Eckerd, but she didn't see me) and now with a new flock of people strap-ons and doggystyle was the topic.&nbsp; So strange.&nbsp; I've NEVER been around a group of people so open about sex like this.&nbsp; I...like it.&nbsp; Most of you chumps have sex but never really talk about it.&nbsp; These people are like ""I love it when a guy pulls my hair and pushes me hard into the wall"".&nbsp; P.S. That's what's up.&nbsp; Hmm, I don't know where I'm going with this one.&nbsp; Just strange that this random assortment of people always seem to be talking about doin' it.&nbsp; My only thing with it is a lot of the people don't look like they've ever had sex.&nbsp; Or that they ""have sex"" and that's it.&nbsp; No spark, no pizzaz.&nbsp; I find myself not exactly believing their stories.&nbsp; But if I met me and I told me some of the things I've done I wouldn't believe me either.&nbsp; Anyway, Starbucks is cool.<br /><br />I was really confident tonight.&nbsp; Working drive-thru you're supposed to schmooze the people a little bit, but I was full on flirting.&nbsp; Like for real.&nbsp; And for no reason.&nbsp; I left Craptain Bill's (get it??) really angry and all of a sudden I was cracking jokes, making everyone smile.&nbsp; Classic ""Kai as the Center of Attention"".&nbsp; Something about that place makes me happy.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; Oh, and I saw a girls panties tonight.&nbsp; Not on purpose.&nbsp; She was a drive-thru customer and her car was low enough that I had to look down to see her face.&nbsp; And there they were, lacy black panties.&nbsp; She was wearing a skirt and I guess when she sat down it rode up or something.&nbsp; I was <em>INCHES</em> from saying something, but that would've been creepy (kinda like this post?).&nbsp; If I were in my car and my nut was hanging out I'd like someone to say something.&nbsp; Back to me being.. um, yeah, let's just change the topic to anything.  Anything at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got a text from Zeke (Kenny Rogers) today saying that he woke up on his left nut and he was pretty sure it was done for.&nbsp; There's a story, but I pretty much just wanted to let you know that Kenny Rogers tried to give himself ""The Stranger"" and it went horribly awry.&nbsp; (Ok, I just looked up ""awry"" to check the spelling and the definition the <a href=""http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict"">dict.org</a> gives me is:&nbsp; Awry \A*wry""\ ([.a]*r[imac]""), adv. &amp; a.

Tonight was Bay Shore High School's senior banquet and apparently I know everyone there still.  Moreover, I know every <i>female</i>  there.  I was behind the bar (I NEVER want to even hear the words ""shirley temple"" again) and had, at least, 5 girls felt the need to greet me with ""Kaaaaaiiiiii!!  Heeeeeeeyyy!"", and then give me a hug.  Normally, I wouldn't care, but I was at work.  One or two are exaplainable; my sister's their age.  But 5+ 17-year-old girls being excited to hug you and hanging around the bar... may look a little sketchy.  It's weird how far back my ties in Bay Shore go.  These kids are 6 years younger than me.  And I still know kids that are freshman!  When I was in high school the oldest person I knew was my grandma.  How do I know all these people?  I guess drama.  And I worked at the middle school for 2-ish years.  I guess that explains it.  But now everyone at work thinks I'm a child molester.  Meh.

Night, law-abiding citizens."

"event","You ever think something is going one way and you're very pleased with
it then all of a sudden something happens and an alternate reality pops
in your head and turns everything upside down?&nbsp; Example: You live
your life, with your house, and your family, and your dog, and then one
day you're watching a movie where the main character is adopted and you
go home and realize that you yourself were adopted.&nbsp; I not going
through anything remotely close to being that dramatic, but all of a
sudden today I was like: ""::GASP::""&nbsp; Still trying to sort things
out.&nbsp; If it turns out I'm right, I am totally ok.&nbsp; I'm ok
with either reality.&nbsp; Yeah for being a grown up.<br>
<br>
So I have my promotion interview today.&nbsp; I'm kinda nervous.&nbsp;
If I don't get I won't be disappointed.&nbsp; I mean, I've only been
there a month and the raise isn't that significant.&nbsp; But if I do
get it I hope it will be a sign of things to come.&nbsp; That reminds
me, I played the Mega-Millions the other day.&nbsp; It was at 102
million.&nbsp; I should check the ticket to see if I won.&nbsp; Anyway,
wish me luck.&nbsp; Hopefully the next time we speak you'll be calling
me Shift Supervisor McNeil, rather than PimpMack Daddy of the Milennium
McNeil.&nbsp; You know, like you usually do.<br>
<br>
So what would you do if you won 102 million dollars?&nbsp; Most people
would say they'd buy a rediculously expensive car, 3 or 4 houses, and
take vacations forever.&nbsp; In all honestly I would do none of
those.&nbsp; Ok, that was a lie.&nbsp; I would buy 3 or 4 houses, but
it'd be an investment.&nbsp; I'd buy decent houses, fix them up, and
rent them out to non-shady characters.&nbsp; And since I would've
bought the whole cash, their rent would pretty much be 100%
profit.&nbsp; Best case scenario, I could <span style=""font-style: italic;"">live </span>off
the rent.&nbsp; Man, this is the best plan ever.&nbsp; Car wise?&nbsp;
I'd sell this one to someone who needs it (Andrew) and prolly get a
Chrysler 300C.&nbsp; I know it a Chrysler, but have you seen that
car?&nbsp; Yes, I'd get 20's and tints and a system, but if you drive
that car without any of those things you'd be a herb.&nbsp; The VERY
first thing I would do is get a copy of my credit report, whip out my
checkbook, and start ripping off some checks.&nbsp; Then I'd call NYU
and tell them if they let me in I'll donate 1 mil to the
university.&nbsp; Then I'd buy a nice, 2 bedroom loft in Manhattan
(another sound investment), set some money aside for Kiera's college,
throw a nice chunk into a mutual fund or two and chill while my life
took shape.&nbsp; This was supposed to be a secret, but I'd also get my
my friends things they needed.&nbsp; A car, an apartment, and MCAT
class.&nbsp; I consider myself very alone most of the time, but I have
people in my life who've been there for me when I needed it most.&nbsp;
I've never been able to repay them in a way I saw fit.&nbsp; Maybe 102
mil can help me achieve that.<br>
<br>
This is why Derek Karl Heck is a jerk:<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">DSpamMan13 (1:05:01 AM):</span> man that 90 degree weather we're having sure is crazy<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">DSpamMan13 (1:05:08 AM):</span> so how's that record breaking NYC snow<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">DSpamMan13 (1:05:10 AM):</span> ;-)<br>
<br>
and then we winks.&nbsp; He winks!&nbsp; This fish taco-eating,
fun-in-the-sun-having, New York-deserting jerkbag winks
afterward.&nbsp; And at one in the morning.&nbsp; I thought I had a
funny, charming friend in L.A., but now all I have is an assball of a
former aquaintance.&nbsp; ::single tear::<br>
<br>
Ok, I need to get some sleep.&nbsp; In my big, empty bed.&nbsp; Trust
me, it's no fun.&nbsp; It'd be so much more fun if there was someone to
sleep with.&nbsp; If there's anyone out there, ANYONE at all that wants
to come keep me company, I'd gladly have you come over.&nbsp; And
over.&nbsp; And over...<br>
<br>
Night, lovers.<br>

"event","The single greatest thing to happen to me today was the introduction of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cash Cab</span>
into my life.&nbsp; Have you seen it?&nbsp; Hosted by Ben Bailey (a
very funny stand-up comedian), it's the best show EVER.&nbsp; You get
in a NYC cab (always a minivan) and these lights and sirens go
off.&nbsp; You have just entered the Cash Cab.&nbsp; For the duration
of your ride you are asked questions ranging in point value from $25 to
$100.&nbsp; But wait: there's more.&nbsp; If you're lucky enough to
stop at a red light it triggers a RED LIGHT CHALLENGE!!!&nbsp; That's
worth $50 per answer and an extra $250 if you name them all.&nbsp; And
of course, there's a down side.&nbsp; If you get three questions wrong
you get no money, AND they kick you out of the cab, whether you're at
your destination or not.&nbsp; Today I saw a guy win $1225 and get his
third question wrong as they're pulling up to his destination.  Cash Cab rocks my life.  Weeknights @6 and 6:30 on Discovery.  I promise you will love it.<br>
<br>
I LOVE the new incarnation of the GEICO commercials.  ""It's like pie...wif chips"".  The way he says it is so definitive.  I look forward to seeing those commercials everytime I watch tv.  I mean, who doesn't love pie?  I don't really get the whole chips thing.  Last time I checked, chips, in England, were French fries.  I would never eat pie and French fries together, but that's not important.  What is important is that I wish I had an awesome fake British accent like that smelly gecko.  <br>
<br>
Joey Lawrence in the Ice Breakers commercial - genius.<br>

If you ever go to Starbucks, please, please, please get the rice krispy squares.  They are ""Los shit"".

And Kai said: let there be sleep.

Night, hofaces."

"event","I go to drop off some shirts at the cleaners.&nbsp; I've been there
before and the [Asian] lady is always all smiles and slight bows.&nbsp;
So I drop the shirts on the counter and she takes my info for the
ticket.<br>
<br>
""Kai?&nbsp; That's nice Chinese name ::slight bow::""<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Kai is Chinese?&nbsp; I think I've heard that
before.&nbsp; I thought it was Hawaiian.&nbsp; What does it mean?""<br>
""Kai...it means... it's 'nice'""<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Oh cool!""<br>
<br>
So I'm really happy at this point.&nbsp; I like learning new things,
especially about my name.&nbsp; Then she looks down at my license (I
layed it on the counter to get money out) and she says ""Oh, nice
picture! You lose weight?""<br>
<br>
This bitch just called me fat!&nbsp; My license picture is abnormally
close up, so I do look a little stocky in it.&nbsp; But for her to
assume that I was a fatty and lost weight...that hurt my
feelings.&nbsp; I went from ""Oh, this lady is pretty cool"", to, ""Lousy
immigrants"" in 8 seconds.&nbsp; I officially hate the _____ese (I'll
fill this in later when I find out what she is.&nbsp; I'd assume
Chinese, but that'd be insensitive).<br>
<br>
I know for a fact I had a lot more to say but now I can't remember
shit.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I'll just leave you with the anti-asian
racist banter.&nbsp; Night, ::insert racial slur here::<br>

"event","Lisa Loeb, I will date you!&nbsp; Why don't you see that?&nbsp; What
don't you understand about this?&nbsp; You have this new reality show (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">#1 Single</span> on VH1) where you try to find a boyfriend.&nbsp; Hello??!?!?!&nbsp; I'm right here!&nbsp; Single as hell, and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">waiting</span>
for your call.&nbsp; You know, not to be creepy or nothing, but you're
the reason I LOVE girls who wear thick-rimmed glasses.&nbsp; And
because of that I will date you.&nbsp; 631-383-6547.&nbsp; Do it.<br>

It's 3am and I am not even remotely tired.&nbsp; This sucks.&nbsp; I
wish ANYONE was up right now.&nbsp; I here right now.&nbsp; Hell, I'd
even let Chad over (burn).&nbsp; And now I'm bored.&nbsp; That was fast.<br>

So I realized that I may have jumped the gun with Ms. Loeb.&nbsp; I looked the show up on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com"">IMDb</a> and it's not listed.&nbsp; But it is called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">#1 Single</span>, and she is a singer/songwrite who releases singles.&nbsp; So maybe, MAYBE it's about her making a new album, but it's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">probably</span> about her dating some douchebag Hollywood-types and then ending up with me.&nbsp; Man, I can't WAIT!<br>

"event","I had an interesting conversation with Bill about me and girls.&nbsp;
He shed some light on things, most of them I already knew.&nbsp; But he
did get me thinking.&nbsp; Why do women like assholes?&nbsp; You want
to change them and make them decent and there's a good person under
there and blah blah blah.&nbsp; It's very self-destructive, masochistic
behavior.&nbsp; You knew he was a dick after you blew him and he didn't
call you for 2 weeks, what makes you think you can ""change"" him?&nbsp;
And you're only going to ""change"" him into the submissive, good
boyfriend, who buy flowers for no reason and tells you you're smart
instead of hot, and who remembers you don't like capers. This new
boyfriend will be just like that guy you met at the supermarket, but
that guy's niceness was unattractive.&nbsp; And then you wonder why
you're 27 and have a long list of douchebag boyfriends.&nbsp; So, so
confusing.<br>
<br>
Guy's aren't too much better.&nbsp; We want girls who grab our cocks
and say ""Fuck me.&nbsp; Now."", but god forbid she's slept with more
than 5 guys.&nbsp; Then she's a whore.&nbsp; We want slutty girls, who
aren't slutty.&nbsp; She's either gonna have 20 bodies on her, or she's
gonna be pretty unexperienced.&nbsp; Can't have it both ways.&nbsp; We
are better though.&nbsp; We definitely do play mind games, but we're
not so much with the little tests.&nbsp; If you ask what color shirt
you were wearing when you first met, and he doesn't remember, it's NOT
the end of the world.&nbsp; He doesn't remember because it was 13
months ago and he shouldn't have to.&nbsp; That simple.<br>
<br>
I kinda want to talk about cheating now, but that's a WHOLE 'nother can
of worms.&nbsp; I claim that out of the majority of guys I know, I'm
one of few who's never cheated.&nbsp; And that's true.&nbsp; Not like I
never <span style=""font-style: italic;"">almost</span> cheated, or
never thought about it, but honestly, what's the point?&nbsp; If you're
with Susie, be with Susie.&nbsp; Just because Mary is there, and is
hot, and is all about your shit does not mean that you have to get with
her.&nbsp; You should've never let yourself get into the situation
where she knew all about your shit in the first place.&nbsp; No?<br>
<br>
I have a toothache.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure my wisdom tooth is trying to
come in, but it's waiting til I have health insurance (circa 232
hours).&nbsp; The <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">second</span>
I get health insurance I'm slamming my arm in a car door, driving to
the hospital, and screaming ""Fix me, bitch!"".&nbsp; Then I'm gonna file
for worker's comp, and live like a fat cat.<br>
<br>
Danielle is leaving for Italy Sunday.&nbsp; I wish her all the best and
safe travels and eat lots of buttery food and all that and come back
soon because I will miss you like britney spears misses being skinny.<br>
<br>
It's cold as shit in my house.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; Hopefully when I wake up the heat will be working.<br>

"event","So it seems that I'm definitely going into the city for New
Years.&nbsp; I think a few years ago I vowed that I'd never go to the
city for New Years cuz it's always so cold and crowded, but I can
revoke said vow because I'll be INDOORS.&nbsp; No snow, no pushing my
way to the MTV window to see&nbsp; Usher wave to the crowd, no smelly,
way too happy foreigners.&nbsp; I think I win.&nbsp; And if everone is
not making empty promises, there's gonna be a good 15-20 of us.&nbsp;
AT OUR VERY OWN VIP TABLE, BITCHES!!&nbsp; Sorry, I didn't mean to
yell, I just wanted to make sure you heard that part.&nbsp; The final
choice seems to be Climax, which is a nightclub.&nbsp; 've never heard
of it, but tonight, when telling people I was ""spending New Years at
Climax in The City"" everyone seemed really impressed.&nbsp; Like I was
spending it at Dick Clark's house or something.&nbsp; Hmm, that doesn't
make any sense.&nbsp; Dick Clark's house will be very empty December
31.&nbsp; His boyfriend might be there, but most likely he'll be in the
green room chilling with his appletini.&nbsp; Anyway, I am looking
forward to having a good time.&nbsp; There might be room, so if you're
interested (and you have titties) holler at your boy.<br>

<br>

I've never had a real good New Years.&nbsp; That's not true, I did
once.&nbsp; December 31, 2003 was a great one.&nbsp; April and I spent
it at a hotel and we came, together, at midnight.&nbsp; I swear to God
(I even capitalized God! I MUST be telling the truth.) I haven't told
many people that because it seems so unlikely, but it really
happened.&nbsp; She came right at 12 and I was maybe 12 and 40
seconds.&nbsp; It was like ""3!!!&nbsp; 2!!!&nbsp; 1!!! ::moan::""&nbsp;
It was the most ridiculous thing ever.&nbsp; I'm still really impressed
with us.&nbsp; Good job, April.&nbsp; But besides that, they've all
sucked.&nbsp; Last year I worked and only made $150 (I was told it'd be
more like $300), the year before that.... I can't even remember.&nbsp;
What the shit did I do?&nbsp; Oh, I'm a dick.&nbsp; I just told
you.&nbsp; The year before that I was with college people in the
Bronx.&nbsp; That's the first time I had a martini.&nbsp; Wow, I was
barely drinking back then.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; Anyway, I hope this New
Years is awesome.&nbsp; I still have no one to kiss, but maybe there'll
be some cheap floosie who digs black guys.&nbsp; I hope not.&nbsp; I
guess I'll just have to just make out with my <font size=""5"">3 bottles of champagne!!!!&nbsp; <font size=""2"">Again, sorry for the yelling.&nbsp; Just trying to rub it in.<br>
<br>
Oh my lord, I have General Tso's just chilling in my fridge.&nbsp; I must remedy this immediately.<br>
<br>
Ok, back.&nbsp; By the way, this was the best idea I've ever had in my
life.&nbsp; Ok, not true.&nbsp; Buying this Chinese food 2 days ago and
letting it age to perfection was the best idea ever.&nbsp; God, the
insight.&nbsp; I love me.&nbsp; But more importantly, I love General
Tso, his delicious sauce, and brown rice.&nbsp; And chopsticks.&nbsp;
Cuz forks are for jerks.<br>
<br>
I've decided to start spelling ""ridiculous"" the correct way (Happy,
Jamie??).&nbsp; Even though I still believe that I am right, no one
seems to be jumping on the bandwagon.&nbsp; It's okay thought, cuz I
have plenty more.&nbsp; There's the Steak and Blowjob Day wagon, the
Spanksgiving wagon, the Thanksgiving steak instead of turkey wagon, and
the ginger ale and bitters wagon.&nbsp; Jump on now, because one of
these days the wagon is going to be FULL (like me after this last bite
of General Tso's delicious bird meat).&nbsp; Night, sluts.</font></font>"

"event","Ok, so Mike Shinoda, the ""rapper"" from Linkin Park, just dropped a solo
album.&nbsp; Seriously, why?&nbsp; Linkin Park can still sell millions,
but it has NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU, Shinoda.&nbsp; You suck.&nbsp; If
anything, it's whiny Chester who makes the money come (but we all know
it's really the DJ, Mr. Hahn.&nbsp; He's the shit).You making a solo
album is like fred ""i banged slutty spears"" durst making a solo
album.&nbsp; It's <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">going</span>
to suck.&nbsp; And do you know why?&nbsp; Because you can't rap.&nbsp;
Yes, you can speak words melodically to a beat, but it is very far from
rapping.&nbsp; But wait, there's more.&nbsp; Some very respected
artists contributed to the album.&nbsp; Common's on it (download <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cold Blooded</span>).&nbsp; Kenna's on it (download anything by him.&nbsp; He fucking rocks.).&nbsp; Black Thought's on it (download <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Thought @ Work</span>).&nbsp; Fuckin Jay-Z <span style=""font-style: italic;"">produced</span>
it (download...shit, if you don't know anything by Jay-Z you are a
leper).&nbsp; But I am fully confident that this album will still
suck.&nbsp; If anyone listens to it, let me know.<br>
<br>
juelz santana.... calm your short, wanna be Tupac ass down.&nbsp; Out
of your whole clique, your shit sold the least.&nbsp; Then you come
back hard with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mic Check</span>, and it was hot.&nbsp; But now... <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Whistle Song</span>??&nbsp; I would bet copious amounts of money that there would be no Whistle Song if Ying Yang hadn't come out with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Whisper Song</span>.&nbsp;
It's one thing to pretend you're a thug and a thief in your songs, but
to actually steal... that's just fucked up, man.&nbsp; Not cool.&nbsp;
Not cool.<br>
<br>
ben kweller.&nbsp; ::sigh::&nbsp; It seems every year I accidentally
see him in concert.&nbsp; First, he opened for Dave in Cleveland.&nbsp;
Then, he appeared the Guster/Ben Folds concert.&nbsp; Then last week,
he shows up at the Guster concert again.&nbsp; I was livid.&nbsp; But
if he opened for Dave, and knows Ben Folds and Guster there must be
something cool about him.&nbsp; That's when the bomb drops.&nbsp;
Guster has him sing and play guitar for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today</span>.
Again, livid.&nbsp; What made it worse is his voice sounded eerily like
the voice on the album.&nbsp; But I quickly pushed that out of my mind,
and tried not to bumrush the stage and kill him.&nbsp; The next day,
Chad texts me to say ""kwellbones is all over Tomorrow Like
Today"".&nbsp; Turns out he was right.&nbsp; Not only did kweller sing
on the album, but he wrote the song in 14 minutes AND played guitar and
piano on the track.&nbsp; He's like 18.&nbsp; And he hangs out with
Guster.&nbsp; I love him, and I hate him.&nbsp; The hate's winning, but
if Guster, Folds, and Dave like him, I'll give him a shot.&nbsp; But
god help him if he lets me down.&nbsp; He lives in Manhattan.&nbsp;
It's only 13 miles long.&nbsp; I'll catch up to him eventually.<br>
<br>
My very close and personal friend, Talib Kweli, is dropping an album, well today actually.&nbsp; He just released <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Beautiful Struggle </span>last summer.&nbsp; A year later, a brand new album.&nbsp; The title - <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD</span>.&nbsp;
I'm poor, so I can't buy it, but if someone loooooves me...&nbsp; In
honor of this pleasant surprise (I wasn't expecting another album for 2
years) I've decided that I must expunge all the suckas from my life to
make it sucka free.&nbsp; So from here on in, I'm running a tight
ship.&nbsp; If I have ever called you a ""sucka"", ""sucker"", ""suckA!"",
""chump"", ""bitch"", or ""herb"", you are now dead to me (also dead to me:
parents, credit cards, and bees).&nbsp; I know this is abrupt, but I
HAVE to be sucka free.&nbsp; Suckas do nothing but get up all on your Kool-Aid, jump up to get beat down, and waste your flava.&nbsp; But there is
chance for redemption.&nbsp; You can ""unsuckafy"" yourself, but I won't
tell you how.&nbsp; You'll have to earn it.&nbsp; Put on your thinking
caps, and get to work.&nbsp; Here's your chance.&nbsp; You can either
shape up, or ship the fuck out.<br>
<br>
Night, suckas.<br>"

turkey, stuffed with a duck, stuffed with a chicken.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp;
Just fucking marinate on that for a while.<br>
<br>
Ok, it's been 17 minutes, and while I'm sure that your mind has been
completely and thoroughly BLOWN, I shall continue to post.&nbsp;
Turducken is, quite possibly, THE GREATEST THING TO EVER EXIST.&nbsp;
Forget sliced bread, fire, the Internet, automobiles, condoms, speech
and language, cunnilingus, cement, plastic, cotton, microchips, and
pie, it is ALL ABOUT Turducken.&nbsp; I just found about it yesterday,
so this Turkey Day is a bust, but next Thanksgiving, it is ON.&nbsp;
This could only get better if a) it somehow gave the eatee a blowjob,
b) the succulent meat of a pig was somehow incorporated, or c) it
somehow gave the eatee a blowjob.&nbsp; To the brilliant creator of the
Turducken, I appluad you*.<br>
<br>
Saw Guster again on Friday.&nbsp; Played <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Happier</span>: check.&nbsp; Played a single song from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Parachute</span>: nope.&nbsp; Had a good seat: check.&nbsp; Hot girls a plenty: check.&nbsp;&nbsp; Played <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Jesus On The Radio</span>:&nbsp;
nope.&nbsp; Took place in the brand new, awesomely swanky Nokia Times
Square Theater: check.&nbsp; Had a fantastic time simply because it was
Guster: check.&nbsp; Had a fantastic time because I was there with
Chad: not a chance in this cold, cruel world.&nbsp; Their opener was
some crappy band called Matt Pond PA.&nbsp; I have no idead if you
pronounce the ""PA"" as separate letters, as pa (as in grandpa), or
whether it's supposed to stand for Pennsylvania.&nbsp; I do have an
idea as to whether they were awesome or not.&nbsp; They weren't.&nbsp;
They fucking sucked.&nbsp; Every song sounded the same, and just so you
know, Matt, adding a cello to every song doesn't make you
revolutionary.&nbsp; It makes you a bitch.&nbsp; Especially since we
ALL knew that the girl playing the cello was some groupie who has dirt
on you.&nbsp; Or better yet, the daughter of the lady who got you the
record deal.&nbsp; You suck, and stop saying ""fucking"" so much.&nbsp;
There were 8-year-olds in the audience, schmuck.<br>
<br>
What else?&nbsp; Car's on the outs.&nbsp; That's what I get for getting some.<br>
<br>
I'm going to Marnie's house for Turkey Day.&nbsp; While there will NOT
be Turducken (lousy jews), there will be some delicious... umm, some
delicious... ahhh, some of that... whatever the fuck jews eat for
Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Whatever it is, I am sure it will be both
unleavened and tasty.<br>
<br>
Just so you all know, I am incredible in bed.&nbsp; I mean, Colin
Farrell, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and any other dirty, skinny bitches you
can think of can't hold a flame to me.&nbsp; That's cuz I'm on <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">F</span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 0);"">I</span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 102);"">R</span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"">E</span></span>!&nbsp;

gay.&nbsp; I heard that he was gay, but I don't mean it like he's gay,
the music is gay.&nbsp; Like if I was picking up a girl for a date and
had this cd playing she'd ask who it was, and then when she got home
tell her roommate, ""He was listening to Jason Mraz.&nbsp; What the fuck
is that about?"".&nbsp; But I like the songs.&nbsp; They're not <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">great</span> songs, but catchy.&nbsp; I don't want to take anything away from him.&nbsp; Not <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Tom's Diner</span>

justify liking gay music.&nbsp; I like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Waiting For My Rocket To Come</span>
and I'm proud of it.&nbsp; Now if I could only come to terms with my
blatant homosexuality we'd be getting somewhere.&nbsp; Night, homos.<br>"

"event","I've never liked Halloween.&nbsp; Not even as a kid when it was all
about getting candy.&nbsp; Now, I may be partly biased.&nbsp; When I
was in 7th grade, my ""mother"" decided that we, as a ""family"", were
jehovah's witnesses.&nbsp; I know exactly what you're thinking, and
yes, it was just as much fun as it sounds.&nbsp; Going to the kingdom
hall (it's what the call their church) 4 nights a week, 3 hours on
Sundays alone, having strangers come to your house and talk to you
about everlasting life, bible studies up the ass, and then the absolute
pleasure of not having a birthday, christmas, easter, or even freaking
Arbor Day.&nbsp; They also believe that Halloween is in fact and evil
holiday.&nbsp; So I haven't been out for Halloween since I was
12.&nbsp; It always stuck me as kinda boring.&nbsp; I get dressed up
and go ask the neighbors I don't talk to 364 days for candy.&nbsp;
Plus, from the time ages 5 to 10 I was a vampire.&nbsp; FOR EVERY
YEAR.&nbsp; So I'm not a fan of Halloween.&nbsp; I am, however, a fan
of the slutty costumes that have become the norm now.&nbsp; I mean, who
doesn't love a big-tittied cop with handcuffs?&nbsp; Anyway, Halloween
sucks.&nbsp; Trick or treat, bitches."

"event","Also, Jennifer Connelly (who was the guest when I saw Conan) AND Brian
Regan are on tonight.&nbsp; It's like god wanted me watch it.&nbsp; God
or the producers, whoever.<br>
<br>
And speaking of god, I came upon the worst (READ: possibly best) site
ever today.&nbsp; loljesus.com.&nbsp; I'm not going to make it a
link.&nbsp; If I did, and you clicked it, then <span style=""font-style: italic;"">technically</span> I would be responsible for what you saw.&nbsp; But since I only <span style=""font-style: italic;"">suggested</span>
the site, you have to manually type it in.&nbsp; No court would convict
me.&nbsp; It might help if you speak ""L337"" (pronounced ""leet"").&nbsp;
It's short for elite.&nbsp; It's the language computer nerds (sorry
Derek.&nbsp; and Steve.&nbsp; and Erik.&nbsp; and Ron.&nbsp; and Op.)
speak.&nbsp; I know very little about it, I do know that the word
""owned"" is spelled ""pwnt"" because when typing, your pinky would
naturally hit the ""p"" rather than the ""o"".&nbsp; And multiple
exclamation points (!!!!!!!!) are !!!!!!1!!, because sometimes people
lay off the shift key.&nbsp; All the pictures have some form of
L337-speak.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; By the way, don't say I didn't warn
you.&nbsp; The site is pretty blasphemous.&nbsp; But then again, so am
I.<br>

Jennifer Connelly wants me so bad.&nbsp; SOOOOOO bad.&nbsp; She appears
on one of my favorite shows at least once a year (once while I was
there).&nbsp; She has green eyes.&nbsp; She always finds a way to be on
the cover of some fashion magazine when I go food shopping, which is
rare.&nbsp; She has green eyes.&nbsp; She was in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Hulk</span>
specifically to make that astronomically grueling 2.5 hours of my life
somewhat bearable.&nbsp; And here's the kicker, she named her son <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kai</span>.&nbsp; Yeah, that's right, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kai</span>.&nbsp;
Just like me (I'm Kai!)!&nbsp; Helloooo?&nbsp; It's like she's saying
""Kai, please come be with me.&nbsp; I'll be sexy, and give you crazy
head, and pay for everything, and since I'm an actress I'll stay hot
for at least another 10 years, and we'll live in LA, and and I have
green eyes"".&nbsp; I mean, duh.&nbsp; All I want to know is why the
games, Jen?&nbsp; You know where I am.&nbsp; You tease me up there on
the tv and movie screens, being all sexy and green-eyed.&nbsp; If you
want to do this, let's do this.&nbsp; I'm game.&nbsp; Just let me know
what to do and it's done, baby.&nbsp; I'll rub your lower back, toes,
whatever you need.&nbsp; Change the babies?&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; Scrub the
floor?&nbsp; With my toothbrush?&nbsp; Done, by the hot latina maid
I'll hire.&nbsp; And not with my toothbrush.&nbsp; I plan on buying a
platinum and diamond one, with the bristles made from bald eagle quills
and giant panda fur.&nbsp; Not attend movie premieres or film festivals
with you because I'm so hideous, puny, and very un-Hollywood?&nbsp; I
guess?&nbsp; I still get to hire the maid, right?&nbsp; Either way, I'm
there.&nbsp; Let's make this happen.&nbsp; Please?&nbsp; I'll make you
the happiest older woman dating a desperately poor soon to be 23 year
old ever.&nbsp; Just stop teasing me!!!!!!!!1!!<br>

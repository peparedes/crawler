"event","Dear Children Next Door, 
     If you could return my lawn gnome to its original spot, I'd be grateful.  I'd also consider lifting the charges I had filed against you.  That happens to be Harold, my favorite gnome.  Quite a serious fellow, he is.  Like me.  I'm serious, too.  Also, Harold's favorite number is 3.14.  Like me.  My favorite number is 3.14.  It's Pi, you see.  So please return him immediately.  Your childish games are revolting.  Harold agrees, I'm sure of it. 
Very Sincerely Yours, 
Moosey Flinigan"

Something horrible, terribly disasterous has happened. 

I made a joke. 

Oh, God, forgive me."

Straight up."

"event","<lj-cut text= ""Journey for my book.""> I visited a High School today, to study the young mind for my new book, ""Being Serious to Succeed; Succeeding to be Serious"". What I found was most appalling. 
The first room I came upon was a Photo class. What a trivial way to spend time in school. A waste of hours, I say. Photos have nothing to say, a quick snap of a button and a picture is developed, admired, then thrown into a stack of photos to be forgotten. What happened to portraits? Painting them? That takes time, effort, and is worth the while. Why snap a picture when you can have a wonderful piece of art hanging in your living room? I've come to the conclusion it's as much the teacher's fault as the students who take the class.
The second class I came to was a history class. The teacher was making jokes about the Pistons and Pacers game, and trying to make Executive, Legaslative, and Judical branches of the government fun and interesting to learn. What muck that these kids heads are being filled with! U.S. History is a SERIOUS, SERIOUS matter. Most upsetting. To top it all off, some of the students were sleeping! What happened to the ruler across the knuckles? Or a leather strap? Punishment is needed to straighten these children out!
I decided to take my leave at that point, to retire to my dwelling and sit and ponder. </lj-cut>

This world is horribly, horribly wrong. What will this generation grow up to be? Fun? Where will that get them? 
I think that it all starts with the toddlers. Foolish parents give thier offspring TOYS to play with, and when it is given by the parent, in the child's mind this is an exceptable thing, to ""play"" with a toy. It all goes downhill from there. 
Perhaps my next book, after I finish this one, will be on proper parenting."

"event","I have joined a community called ""Meterosexuals"". I am a meterosexual. A distinguished group of gentlemen, we are. They have alerted me to the joys of three piece tweed suits. I am usually found in khaki dress pants and a nice button up polo shirt. I will be investigating this tweed wonder soon, though.
Sincerly yours, 
Moosey"

"event","Greetings! This is the first entry in my newly aquired journal. I felt I needed to share my wonderful opinions with the world, and what better way than this? Please, comment on anything I might say here at any time, they are welcome. I am most looking forward to this experience.
My ""user picture"", as this site calls it, is of James Dean, as he was a fine young man. He was a meterosexual, I am most sure of it. 
Sincerely yours, 
Moosey"

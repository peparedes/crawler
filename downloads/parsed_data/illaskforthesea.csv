"event","So I'm sitting here staring at my computer, contemplating and trying to decide where to begin. I have never been good at discretion and there are so many things I just want to blurt out... get out of my head. Break is finally over. It felt like forever, but went by so fast. Not so much a contradiction if you think about it. 

Tomorrow begins yet another semester. Only my fourth but I'm almost halfway through. Thus begins the reminiscing. I am completely different from that wide-eyed, optimistic and feisty redhead that tromped into Lafollette last year. I'm no longer innocent but am still extremely naive about certain things. The optimism quickly faded as I realized that getting a 4.0 would be no easier in college than it was in high school. I'm still feisty though, though only when I need to be. I can get a little wild sometimes but most of the time I try to stay classy and refined. One thing hasn't changed and that's my utter surprise that I affect anyone - by my actions, my words, anything. Why do I continue to believe that nothing I do matters and how did I get this way? I only know that I am hurting others in this way and believe me, that is not my intention. In fact, I think I let people run over me too much. My mom keeps telling me to start living for myself and not for others. Not sure how to balance all this. I can't be the only one who struggles with this? If any one has some advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

I am 20 years old and feel like a 15 yr old. But I can kick it into gear when I need to. I just need to up my level of motivation this semester and kick some ass with grades. Take care of myself and get involved with Pi Phi again. I kind of disappeared last semester and people finally started asking where I was. Once again, kind of a shock that people noticed my absence. But why? GRrr it's frustrating sometimes.

Anyways, this sounds like a depressing entry BUT IN REALITY>>> I am so pumped to begin this semester and be the student I know I can be. :)"

Tough weekend, for that matter. 

Not quite sure what's going on lately. I feel like everything is moving too fast and I'm powerless to stop it. I'm not sure if I want to. 

But I have more than one person's expectations to live up to. And someone gets hurt either way. Well, make that two people including me. 

Why am I constantly in no win situations lately?

I just want to ""get back to me"" ... cliche, boring, pathetic and by fucking aces it's true!"

"event","Today has been a pretty amazing day. And not for a particular reason. I just feel happy right now. I got to sleep in until about one and then ran to the mall with Jen to get some cowboy boots and jeans for the Barn Dance tomorrow night. Then I got back and Sarah needed to go to WalMart so I tagged along. We ended up going back to the mall again and I got my bangs cut, so exciting! We had dinner at Applebee's - I'm still stuffed. And I walked out with some pretty dec leftovers. I ran out of money at WalMart and I'm getting pissed about the lack of National City's up here in Munchie. I think I'm going to switch banks this weekend so I don't have to keep paying ATM user fees. BLEH! Nate's not feeling too well this weekend. He made the travel team this week and they had an eight hour bus ride. Everytime I talk to him on the phone he's either sleeping or about to throw up. Poor kiddo - I'm worried about him. I would do anything to be there and take care of him right now. I guess he talked to his Dad about getting a car pretty soon, so that will be amazing when he can actually go places (aka, to see me hehe). It's exhilirating to be able to get off campus and go out and do things. I just got over being sick for a month (bronchitis) and I was a major couch potato. I'm finally able to get involved with Connections and Reel Deal and class and people again! Maybe that's why I'm so happy... At any rate, Hocus Pocus is on so I have to go. But I'll leave you with this:

Take my hands, sistahs, we will share her! Oh Winnie, how generous of thee!

"event","It's just one of those random things that make me want to go out and get plastered. You know, you hear something, and to everyone else it seems insignificant. But to you, who knows the history, the background, the details... it makes your heart feel like it's being squeezed. I am by no means a partier. I rarely have the desire to consume warm beer while I'm surrounded by touchy feely frat guys and inebriated, scantily clad frat rats. I like to know where I am when I wake up and having recollection of all my sexual encounters. And I have never learned the sacred art of the beer bong either.

Apparently, my best friend has the desire to do so. Just last year she was a bible thumping CRU-goer. This year she's suddenly a party animal? We know everything about each other. Every flaw, every wish and dream and goal and thought. It's almost sad how we can quote each and every Will and Grace episode (seasons 1-3) and laugh at the same parts at the same time. It's scary how much we talk alike, sometimes people can't tell us apart on the phone (which, I have to admit, has come in pretty handy). 

It's hard for me to call her, expecting her to answer and instead having someone random pick up and say that's she's bonging a beer. At 7 o'clock at night. Without me... 

Maybe that's the real issue here. That I'm not there for the first time in awhile. It's still shocking to hear that my once sober friend is now a professional at getting wasted. 

I'm just sick of all my friends going out and getting drunk. Where's the appeal in puking every weekend?? I can do it once in awhile but I like to be with a small intimate group of friends rather than people I've never met in my life. 

Now, I have to admit that the first semester of my freshmen year I went out quite a bit. And made a few mistakes. But that was short-lived. And it got old quickly. 

So now, I just want to get drunk. Maybe I am missing out by being so uptight about this. I know you're supposed to live it up while you still can - and I am. I just want to remember it. And I want to know my best friend. This beer bonging party animal is not who I know.

"event","I just could not help me self today... I walked by W&G at Target and couldn't leave it sitting there on the shelf when I knew it should be sitting on my own shelf. 

Moved in Wednesday - honestly almost cried when I saw the tiny dorm room patiently awaiting my numerous boxes. The bathroom was so raunchy with little black hairs all over the sink and tile scum BLEH (only the worst kind!) After a little (and by little I mean 6 hours) work and my mom's freak organization, it almost looked like a room I might possibly like. 

Negative Nancy... Alex used that term tonight and I kinda like it. That's how I feel right now, plus a whole lot better. Not nauseous anymore, but still no appetite. Which is WEIRD because ya'll know I LOVE to eat. 

Forgot my hookah. Ok, I lie. I didn't bring because I didn't know where I would be able to smoke it without getting in trouble. Plus, I don't think people really know what it is. I don't want to give the wrong impression.

It's really weird with all these freshmen around. You can definitely weed them out - they all dress like sluts and run around in packs. And, they are overly friendly yet bitchy and judgmental at the same time. It's neat to watch this and realize that I was like that last year and it makes me feel old. 

Speaking of old, only a few short weeks until I turn 20. Half of forty. 1/3 of 60. 2X 10. No matter how you add it up, it still feels old. Don't know if I'm ready for this type of commitment. I wish I could...

I don't know what I wish. But all this change is making me edgy, and sad, and... I miss Nathan so much. It's not just ohhh I wish I had someone to rub on HAHAHA no, seriously, it's every little thing. I walk to the bathroom and think, ""I wish Nate was sitting on my bed and when I come out of the bathroom, I'll see his face."" weird, huh...

"event","Okay, so for those of you who have been asking...hookah has absolutely nothing to do with pot! It's a device used to smoke flavored tobacco called shisha. If any of you have seen Alice in Wonderland, the Caterpillar is smoking a hookah and he uses the smoke to spell out a story. It's a relaxing and social thing and I'm bringing it to school with me so anyone who wants to try it just let me know! There are several different flavors such as peach, apple, strawberry, mixed fruit, etc. Peach is my favorite though!!
The base is decorated with a beautiful design and the hoses that you smoke out of are usually colorful and decorative as well. 

I don't know how to get pictures on here.. so when I figure that out, I'll post a pic. Either that or go to www.froogle.com, click on ""images"" and type in hookah.

"event","The countdown has officially begun: three days until I am back in Muncie, back into the old school routine, back to my alternate life. And I really feel like it is an alternate life. The real me is at home with my family and my friends and Nate. The real me doesn't go to college and turn 20 years old. I have always been strongly opposed to change. I have lived in three houses and I love each one and have special memories in each one; it was hard to leave them behind for someone else's memories. Sometimes I drive by the house I was born in and scoff at the current owner's taste in paint and landscaping because it's so radically different from what I am used to. People say that home is with your family and that's true but a house holds your family and those memories - it may be just a building, but I find it equally important. I guess I sound a little dramatic, but that is how I feel, I give no excuse. 

Yesterday I had to drive Nate down to Rose Hulman. I was great while we unloaded the truck, unpacked and set up his room, ate lunch with the family and checked out the campus. The hard part was when I had to drive away from my soul mate and best friend, leaving him behind to his new life, one that wouldn't include me. Obviously I'll see him again, it's not as if we're parting forever. However, things are different now, they can't ever be the same. His home is now Rose-Hulman, he won't be driving his silver pick-up around town anymore, I can't see him whenever I want for a quick hug and kiss. I cried the entire hour and a half home because I was hating CHANGE. Ugh, I'm such a baby but I can't live without my baby!!

I'm spending the night at the Spille's and they are refusing to go to sleep. I keep putting them to bed and they keep getting out of bed. It's probably because they miss their parents or it may be their usual routine... Parents these days let their kids run around until they crash -- there's no set bedtime. Every time I babysit I think of things that my own kids will or won't do. But, that's still a long way away! I can't wait...

The Spille's are angels compared to the kids I babysat two weeks ago. One of my friends from high school went on vacation and I filled in. Let me just give a quick background on these children. Both boys; One is 11 and the other is 13. The older one is 6 ft 2 in -- Me? I'm 5 ft 1 in. Yeah... He also has severe ADHD (I swear he is borderline autistic) Combine that with not wanting to take showers, eat, get out bed, call friends, or listen to me and you've got babysitting hell. For example, we went to the pool one day. They are each allowed to bring a friend along for whatever we do... the younger one had no problem calling up a friend. Of course, the older one fought me every step of the way - I looked up a few of his friend's #'s, he wouldn't call them, so I tried and he snatched the phone away. He said he wanted to stay home (his mom works out of the house, so sometimes he can) so we go ask his mom and she says no. So he takes a video game to the pool, doesn't bring swim trunks, sits in a corner sulking and fighting with his brother, gets upset because he got the same amount of snack food $$ as everyone else, not more. His mom shows up to swim and she starts throwing buckets of water on him trying to get him to come in. Well half an hour later and 20 buckets later, he is soaked and pissed. She leaves and I have to deal with the aftermath which includes hitting, pouting and screaming. And he never got in.

I don't know how I survived that week and a half! I don't know how Emily survived the entire summer! It was good money though... their mom paid $0.40 a mile. 

Anyway.. enough bitching. I want to go smoke my hookah. I got hooked (oh my. sooo lame). Meghan and I went over to Annie's one night and I fell in love with it. So Meghan and I went to Zorba's and each got ourselves one. Nate is not too crazy about it, he thinks only ""hippies"" smoke hookah and he doesn't like hippies (because they also smoke pot). Interesting... but this is something I like and it's better than getting trashed all the time and all the other naughty little things I could be doing.

So yesterday we decided that Zionsville has nothing to offer whatsoever (what took us so long?) and we ended up roaming the endless aisles of Michael's. I can draw but I've always wanted to learn how to paint, so I picked the a bit of the cheapest the they had to offer: oil paints, a canvas, paintbrushes and paint tray. It put me a whopping $14 in the hole... I was eager to get started and when I arrived home I realized that I had left everything in Meghan's car because I was so anxious to get home. Another trip and gallon of gas wasted, ah! But it turned out fine and I decided that for my first painting ever I would attempt the hardest subject possible: the illustrious SUNSET muahahahaha. It was fun, except who knew that you had to use mineral spirits instead of water to get OIL paint out of paintbrushes (dear lord, if you can't tell... every word I've written is ""dripping with disdain"")?! Anyways, I thought it was pretty and obvious that it was a sun but Mom, Jen, and Meghan decided that it was a picture of grass, on fire, with heavy black smoke filling a blue sky. So much for my artistic abilities. I have to go use them now on the lawn!

On the other hand, when you're sitting at home on your ass, alone, for two days in a row, things can get pretty ugly. Not to mention to hairdo I'm sporting right now, but let's not go there. I've been talking to my friend Luke from BSU a lot lately. It's been nice honestly because we talk about interesting things instead of the usual mindless, ""How's your summer going?"" that no one can seem to part with. The other night we were up until 3am just talking about things and then he drops a bomb -- Of course, me being a naive small-town child had nothing to do with the fact that I completely overlooked his flattering, overattentive overtures. UNTIL he claimed that we could no longer talk because he liked me, alot. The whole time I had been rambling on about my boyfriend and how perfect we were for each other and how much I miss him (he's in Siesta Keys) and Luke is dropping hints right and left. I felt terrible because what does one say in that situation without seeming like jackass. I only hope I played no part in encouraging those feelings intentionally. I didn't expect it to hurt like it did. It was even more awkward to talk to Nate about it this morning, but I was still sore and I needed some comfort. Unfortunately, he couldn't get past the fact that I had been talking to another boy and that I was upset about losing Luke's friendship. Nate did admit, however, that it was chivalrous of Luke to step aside. I just wish the whole thing had never ocurred. Bleh... I'm off to get some paints and brushes... I need something to do on this rainy day. Too bad I haven't been able to mow the lawn, eh?

Matt and Dad are coming home in a few days, YEAH! I miss them more than I thought I would, ahaha. And I can't wait until Michigan.

"event","I'm just sittin here in the kitchen waiting for Meghan's ass to arrive. I actually did some work around the house, though I think it was less than appreciated. Dad woke me up early (around 9, which, yes, is early for me) and started yelling at me about not getting a job and just sitting on my ass all day. But in truth, I really have been putting in a ton of effort towards finding a job. I've made several follow-up calls and even more today in front of Dad. He immediately critiqued the phone call and told me every wrong thing that I said. I still haven't told him that I already have a job lined up. Technically, it's more like 2 or 3. Mom hooked me up with some ladies she worked with who both need a babysitter this summer. It will be almost every day from 8-5, so about 40+ hours a week. Dawn called this afternoon and threw a few more dates out there so on a couple of days I will be getting paid by three different moms, averaging at about $21 an HOUR... that's way better than some crappy job at Kohl's. Plus, I love kids so it won't be too bad. Just wondering how Devin and Des are going to handle me not paying 100% attention to them on those days when I'll have the other two boys. 

Megs and I did double abs today because we forgot to visit Richard and Patchy yesterday. I was about to die, I swear. And if I go down, so will Rich...because no one should be that excited and cheery while they're exercising. I'm proud of us though, for doing it everyday and not drinking coke. I think I'm seeing some results, however it's only been one week so I can't be sure. We decided not to weigh ourselves at the very beginning so we would be surprised at the end (we both have a general idea of where we're at).

Nate and I worked something out and it's been great ever since. The other night felt so off beat but the past couple of days have been amazing. Love you baby...

"event","So, this is day four of Richard Simmon's ab busting workout -- seven minutes a day, seven days a week, seven weeks. I'm beginning to think that this flamboyant workout Nazi actually enjoys pain and suffering. Meghan and I were literally screaming in pain from the extra ""just eight more's."" The funny thing is, it actually yields results, and quickly. Which is good for me because when it comes to exercising, I tend to give up easily, especially if it doesn't seem something is happening. To keep ourselves on track we made a lovely little chart and took a darling little Richard Simmons oath for ourselves. The other stipulation is NO COKE WHATSOEVER. We hear that the you drop weight fast when you stop drinking it. It's not that I'm overweight, I'm just not trim and fit. I need to buy a pair of roller blades when I get some money. Still waiting to hear back from all the places that I applied to -- Barnes & Noble, Michael's, Kohl's... I think I'm going to have to apply at Target again, but I realllly do not want to work there, even though Nate does and it would be fun to work with him.

Yesterday was our two year anniversary and we had so much fun. Nate took me to Bahama Breeze off of 96th and Keystone. It was a long wait but the tropical atmosphere was pretty interesting and the food choices were semi-exotic. I ended up being a plain Jane and ordering pizza. However, the waiter took us to be of drinking age so I took full advantage of that and ordered an Atlantic. It was this frozen drink mixed with Blueberry Scnhapps and Rasberry Schnapps and ice cream and blueberries. It was delicious. After dinner we went back to Nate's and I helped his mommy with some graduation stuff. It made me glad that I hadn't orderd those special invitations from Herff-Jones. Around 10:30 we hopped in the car and drove to Regal 17 in Westfield to get in line to see Star Wars... Meghan and Matt Paddack met us there and the damn line was wrapped clear around the building. It was kind of funny to see all these wookies and Lukes running around with plastic lightsabers and taking things way too seriously. I still hold that the original three movies are way better. The only thing good about the movie was maybe the special effects. The acting was less than mediocre and the lines were incredibly cheesy -- ""The force is strong with you"" -- ""I will not leave without you, Master."" -- And so on... It was fun to be sitting next to my baby and fun to be be retarded with Meghan sitting on the other side.

More later, Nate should be here soon.

"event","I wish I could say I am somewhere else than home! I was so excited to come home and sleep in my own bed and see all my friends and be able to finally have a space of my own. And although I've been out every night this week, it's been with Meghan. I still feel like I need permission from the 'rents, even though they seem to be fine with it. I don't get to see Nate nearly as often as I'd like or thought I would and all those friends I'd thought I'd see...? Well, I don't know where they are. 

Next week should be better as I have several things going on at once. Jeff is coming into town this weekend for Nate's birthday so Saturday will be spent shopping with the boys, and Sunday will be consumed by eating lunch with Jeff and Nate's birthday dinner cooked by Gammaw! Ohhh, chicken and noodles. Don't try to tell me you're not jealous. On Monday I am ""Dani-watching"" as Jean-o so cleverly described it. Tuesday is a birthday party at Cheeseburger in Paradise for Nikides and Meredith. Wednesday is our two year anniversary! I don't think we have any special plans for that but Nate bought two tickets for the midnight premiere of the Star Wars movie. After that, hopefully I'll be getting ready to start at a new summer job! I applied at Barnes & Noble and Michael's over by Clay Terrace and I'll be putting in another app at the new Old Navy on Zionsville Rd. Texas Roadhouse will be a last resort, hopefully not even an option! I'm getting a lot of pressure from my parents, they expect me to contribute double the amount I did last year. We'll see how that works out though... 

Megs and I took a road trip to Plato's Closet in Fishers with a bunch of old clothes. They didn't take anything of hers and only a few items from mine totaling $20. I was kind of ticked because I had a pair of perfectly good Doc Martins that fit me (size 8) but the tag said 5 because they're made in a different country, so they wouldn't take them because they only take size 6 and up!! I'm thinking I could have at least made $20 more. Oh well... Maybe next time. I also donated about 10-15 pairs of shoes to Goodwill and that felt good. It was not as hard as I though it would be. All I have to do is keep going through my clothes and shoes and putting the things that I don't wear aside. I'm in a definite spring cleaning mode. 
I think I might help Megs clean her house tomorrow. She's been on a cleaning rampage today. And I don't want to sound mean, (this is coming from a girl who's mom is a clean FREAK) but it needed it! They have so many animals it must be hard to keep it hair-free. I know that Sadie and Bailey shed so much we have to sweep the kitchen every day. My Tcom profs kept mentioning that Americans are obsessed with cleanliness and I'm beginning to think he's right. But who wouldn't want to be body-odor free? I mean I don't like greasy hair and dirty clothes. What civilized society would? I hope that doesn't sound shallow, and I'm not sure if our culture has trained me to say exactly that. It's just my personal opinion that we should take care of ourselves. 

Anyhow, I know this is long but I just had to add one thing more. Tonight was the Senior Awards Night and Nate was asked to come. Seniors are only extended an invitation if they are to recieve some sort of scholarship, award, or recognition. Nate had applied for about 20 different scholarships so reason has it that he was bound to get at least one. And that's exactly what happened. I was proud of him, but he was so disappointed. In situations like these, there really isn't something you can say to make the situation better, at least, I can never think of anything. I just wanted to say AT LEAST YOU GOT SOMETHING!!! But that's just my mentality. He did put in a ton of hard work and he deserves so much more. But he attends Zionsville High School... the competition is FIERCE. At any other school he would have been valedictorian. But our school system is tough and there are a lot of talented kids. That was more than obvious tonight. 

At any rate, I think it's time for bed. This will be the first night in awhile that I've settled down before 2 or 3! Last night we watched a movie until 5. Geez..

"event","MMMM I looove the tacos from downstairs. It's sad to think that I won't be able to run downstairs and grab one when I'm hungry. Ouchamagoucha! America's Next Top Model is on tonight! That show is my one guilty pleasure, as far as tv goes. Anyhow, I just got back from another workout. Tonight Jackie and Meghan and I met up for yoga. I could definitely still feel yesterday's workout. Tomorrow is kickboxing and I'm excited. Jackie's going home but Meghan will still be here. I'll see if I can recruit Sarah as well, except she didn't want to go tonight, so we'll see. I need to take a shower... I feel dirtydirty. I got a little frustrated today because I thought someone would be able to help me move out on Friday but apparently, Mom and Dad will both be busy and Nate was supposed to work but he's ditching to play Ultimate Frisbee. So I won't get to see Matt at wrestling state or Nate play frisbee and they won't get to see me. Dad was like, well just have your friends help. Helloooo it's not like they're moving out as well!!! Grr, I can do it but I just thought my own family would be able to help me. I guess I am over-reacting because this week has been semi-stressful. One thing that has been stressing me out more than finals is Nate. He hasn't done anything wrong, we've both been so busy this week that we havn't been able to talk to each other much. I just have a feeling that this is how it's going to be next year. Either I have to suck it up and get used to feeling lonely, or don't deal with it, which is not really even an option. I just need a lot of attention and I love hearing his voice. It will be hard enough not seeing him, but not getting to talk him either?? What kind of a relationship is that? I can't believe I'm even saying any of this, it has just been on my mind and I don't want to say anything to Nate. 
SIGH ohh my abs hurt! I love it!

"event","So wow. Today has been busy and amazing. I spent most of the day out of my room, which is a definite plus considering I was sliding into a little slump. However, I was forced out of bed by a 12 o'clock final and when that was over I went back to the dorm and checked my email. What I was looking for was an email from Connections Live but instead I found a tantalizing email from my big sis about a Senior Cookout from 3-6. So I finally had something to do. Juliana picked me up and I sat up all the food buffet style while she tried to start a fire, and that was a challenge considering it was cold and windy and we were without lighter fluid or newspaper. It was fun to see the girls and sad to say goodbye to the seniors. They passed out old t-shirts and I got a few that are really cute! Then Dom, Erica and Meghan were going to leave early for a hip-hop dance class and I thought it sounded fun so they invited me to come along. It was so much fun and even though I'm uncoordinated, I still got quite a work out. I am already sore... can't wait to see how I'll be tomorrow! BSU is also offering a yoga class tomorrow and a kickboxing class on Thursday. I will definitely be there, it was fun to get some stress out. And those damn endorphins never fail to kick in... I was super hyper afterwards. Then I checked my voicemail and found that Kira left me a message asking if I wanted to go to Applebee's and so of course I called her back right away and said hell yea! So she picked me up some to-go and we took it back to her house so we could eat and watch Gilmore Girls. Well the damn Pacer's game took forever and of course they had to have a post-game show, so that pushed it back. It didn't get over until 10:30. But it was fun to hang out with Kira, she cracks me up and it's scary how much we sound alike when we're talking on the phone with our boyfriends! So here I am in my dorm and Megs and I just had a fun lil IM adventure with freaky ass whacko who apparently looked me up on facebook and felt the urge to IM me because he was, and I quote, ""board."" Is that stiff as a board now? Seriously people, learn how to spell! Especially if you're graduating like this guy is supposed to be. UGH THAT PISSES ME OFF WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T SPELL CORRECTLY. Anyhow, now I'm headed off to a midnight breakfast with Jackie. FUN! 
I LOVE YOU MEGS!!

"event","I don't even want to stop and think about how many times that phrase has been used and reused. I just couldn't think of anything else and to be honest, it describes today perfectly. I don't think that I've been out of my room since Friday night. On Saturday, Nate came to visit and we had one of those lazy Saturdays, just laying around watching tv, taking the occasional nap and sleeping. I had to pack most of my room up and Dad sent some boxes up with Nate. It was nice to get that out of the way. It was kind of sad packing up all my things. Human beings are afraid of change and I am a prime example. Last week was busy as hell and overwhelming. I feel like I am constantly PMSing because all of a sudden I'll get all sentimental and start to cry. I'd think about all the times I would lay on my bunk bed and stare at the ceiling and find little pictures. Sounds pathetic, I know. But I know I'm not the only one who's done it! Haha. Then I thought about how this girl stopped by at the beginning of last semester to see her old room. I remember laughing at her because I'd just moved in and hated our ""prison cell."" Now I can't imagine not living here, and to be honest I'll end up being that girl coming back to reminisce. Anyhow, Nate left around 11 and Sarah went home because she had to go to prom and crown the prom queen. So I was alone and I hate it when she's not here. I always have to sleep with the tv on! I had nightmares for the first time in awhile. Every time I have a bad dream it's about tornadoes. I really think I have a tornado phobia. Sar and I were watching the Incredibles last night and there's this one part where a super hero gets sucked into a vortex because of his cape and I swear that computer animated tornado made me get sweaty palms and my heart started to race. Even when BSU tests the tornado sirens every Friday and I know it's coming, I still freak out. Especially if I'm outside at the time.  

So... Sunday was literally a day of rest. I slept until 2:15! And then I lounged around until about 5:30 because Pi Phi provided free Subway for finals food. That took all of 45 minutes and then we came back and watched movies. Then today I didn't wake up until noonish. Popped in Will and Grace and read a little Ayn Rand ( I love her! ) Then Sar and I went to Connections Live! audtions around 6. I didn't do so hot... Which  surprised me... I thought I would do well since I had the Scene experience behind me. Oh well. They have call-backs tomorrow. I'm not getting my hopes up. I haven't even studied for finals and my parents have been  bugging me about it. I called the other day to ask about something totally unrelated and my mom starting babbling about how I need to get sleep so I'm not sick so I don't sleep through finals or something. I saw my dad today and he said something along the same line. I have English tomorrow and that will be a breeze. Sarah already took it and she said it was tres easy. The only ones I'm semi-worried about are Spanish and Math 125. I'm going to get a lot of help on Math though, so hopefully I'll understand it more by Friday. 

At any rate, I'd better get going and actually hit the books. Good luck on all your finals people!! Have a great summer!

And also, I had to take a shower. It sucks, but I'm ok. hahah and IT IS THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!! I can pretend to be all excited about it like everyone else seems to be or I can tell the truth. It scares me that my freshman year of college is already over. Literally scares the livin daylights out of me. Because now I am a sophomore and then a junior and suddenly BAM four years is over and it's time to start my life for real. Who knows what is going to happen between then and now. I can only hope that Nate and I will stick with it and come out of all this together and still willing to get married. haha. Well, more on this later. I have to go dry my hair.

So, who knew that things could get any worse? I mean seriously. Have you ever put a ton of effort into something and then have someone shit on it publicly???? someone like a professor? in front of your entire class? i worked on this project with scott and john and we put so much work into this thing and then for that bastard to tell us that we plagarized?? he can go fuck himself... that class is shit anyhow. grrr i just need to blow off some steam. 

i dont want to be one of those LJers that is constantly bitching but writing is my passion and i have to get it out somewhere... sometimes i look through other people's LJs and see that every entry is negative and their little emoticon is pissed off or something hahah. my little hampsters pretty cute when its pissed though, wouldn't you agree? so sorry for another entry like this.

"event","oh. dear. sweet. lord. it's late... it seems that whenever i finish one project i have to immediately start on another. it has been so hectic these past few days. and i am beat! i had such a crazy weekend, and not the  good kind. thankfully, someone invited me to a party this weekend and i will be able to relieve some stress. it's been awhile since i've been out and truthfully, i deserve it. i've been thinking alot about pi phi and how much i love my sisters, but with the amount of money that we pay, it just does not seem worth it. i have invested so much money for nothing, it could have been going towards something else. the thing is, i dont pay for it because i am not able to. my parents are forking over all this money for something i am not pleased with and Nate is not pleased with and my parents are pleased with, just to name a few. everyone keeps saying it will be different next year. but its not like we are going to be home free. they are still going to watching us like hawks. so if i am still not satisfied after next semester, it's over. i have so many other things i need to be concentrating on. its such a shame because i will lose all the money i put into it, but i will be saving so much money as well. and its not like i wouldnt see all my friends. there wouldnt be any hard feelings, hopefully. they keep saying pi phi is supposed to be a part of our lives, not taking it over. i dont really feel that way at the moment. everything i bitch about is related to pi phi. nate is just about fed up with it. i dont think thats the way it should be. anyhow...

after chapter last night Shoney threw a sex toy party and it was SO MUCH FUN. i wasnt able to go to liz's last friday so i convinced sarah to stay with me and wow. it was such a blast! partly because it was so funny but partly because being with my sisters in a situation like that was like weird bonding time. i ordered a few things! haha can you believe it.. i was the one who was freaking out the most! i went to the library afterwards and worked on my damn english website. i hate it. but its over and thats all that matters. now i can start concentrating on other classes. 

i spent 3 hours at the library working on that website and catching up with people. then dom and i went to taco bell! HELL YEAH i was seriously craving some tacos, dont ask me why. but i watched greiner eat some at exec and i could not control myself!! so that was fun. we sat in the parking lot, pigged out, and bitched about pi phi a lil bit. good times!

well, i better head to bed, although i still have to write that effing jingle for TCOM 207. BUH!

oh yes.. great news, i finally schedules classes! im happy although next semester will be all core classes and a few fillers thrown in. P.E. here i come!!

It's all good, but really, I'm thinking that it was a once in a lifetime experience. Nate and I are watching Pirates of the Carribbean but we all know I would rather be watching the new What Not to Wear!! Tomorrow is going to be a fun day, I'll get to hang out with my Mommy and take Nafan some lunch between his soccer games. I brought so much crap home from school that I'll be spending alot of time cleaning my room and reorganizing. It will be nice to get it ready for the summer... Plus I have some clothes and shoes that I need to toss (to make room for new ones of course!) I hope Meghan can come home this weekend. I haven't seen her forever and I miss my poodle!! I finally got some pictures back from prom. We didn't take a camera to prom or anything so I don't have any ones other than the ones my parents took. Let's see if I can do this... Ok never mind!

Well, didn't have any homework so I spent the whole time doing fun, mindless things like  reading Cosmo and cutting words out of magazines. And BAM I feel much better.

"event","Sometimes I have to wonder if anyone ever feels like I do. When I observe other people, the answer seems to be no. We all have frustrations and little quirks, but no one seems to be able to put them out there. Everyone strives to be ""normal."" I just poured my heart out to one of my friends and they called me a fag. Apparently, they thought I was being too sentimental or emotional. I wish that word did not have such a negative connotation. It just embodies what is wrong with our society. People aren't comfortable enough with each other to let out their true personality. For instance, as a child I loved to read. But it was something I hid because other kids taunted me. Why be ashamed of something like this? Turns out that the kids who taunted me loved to do the same or ended up being practically illerate. There are so many thoughts running through my head and I just can't put them into words. I feel like I am trapped, but the weird part is... do I like it? Loathe it? Or do I feel this way because others told me to?
I can't tell if I am happy or not, and that scares me. I've been pushing people away these past couple of days. I think that's my way of finding out. I even told Nate not to call me tonight because I wanted some time to myself. Now I am restless and bored and wishing that he would call. I think I am just frustrated and stressed and nervous. There are some major changes coming my way. This summer Nate and I will be working our asses off. We won't be able to see each other much. And then he will be going to college... all the way down at Rose-Hulman. And I'm happy for him, I really am. Everything is falling into place for him. I can't help but envy that. He is so goal-oriented and motivated. I wish I could be the same. Motivation is something I lack. So he will have to adjust to college and a tough school like Rose while starting on their football team. Football lasts 10 weeks and he won't have a car until like next January. So you tell me how this is going to work. He keeps saying he would rather not think about it, just take one day at a time. That's ok, but not realistic. Don't get me wrong, I am willing to make this work and put effort into it. I love Nate with all my heart, I can't see myself with anyone else. I just don't want to be a burden or distraction to him. Plus, it IS his first relationship. He hasn't seen all the world has to offer. That scares me the most. Anything is possible... we'll see how it all pans out. At any rate, I just want to listen to some depressing music and have a good cry. It's about time for one of those."

I freaked out a little bit, thinking that the university didn't have me registered as a student for next year. But, I'm ok. They have another sign-up session starting April 25th. WHEW --> I was pretty stressed for a bit. Anyway, I was so tired from prom that I just stayed at home last night and came home early this morning. It was a bit chaotic when I got back to BSU because I had to take the van back to the stadium, lug my duffel bag back to the dorm in nice, but hot, 80 degree weather. When I got back, I saw that my awesome roomies boyfriend has disassembled my loft. YEAH!!! So of course, I kicked into cleaning and organizing mode right away. I had class at 11 and it was nearing 10:30 but I kept on cleaning. So finally at like 10:45 I stop cleaning and grab my books and run outside to catch the shuttle. Of course I missed it by like a minute. So my out of shape ass huffed all the way to Burkhardt and I swear I was going to pass out... I get there and class is CANCELED!! That's right! My face turned even redder and I swear I wanted to throw a fit right there. But I was relieved because it was extra time to finish some TCOM homework that I forgot about over the weekend. Now I'm watching Princess Diaries and contemplating about whether or not I should take a nap on such a lovely day. Hmm, I hardly got any sleep over the weekend. We stayed up until at least 6am Saturday night and Sunday was Nate's mom's birthday cookout. I wasn't too excited about that one, just because I think his mom is getting more and more strict knowing that Nate will be gone in a few months. It hasn't been fun lately and I feel so uncomfortable being around her. It's not that she dislikes me or vice versa, it's just... weird. Other than that, things are good. I feel like I fell in love all over again. It's an amazing feeling!"

"event","So it is a gorgeous day outside and here I am, sitting at the computer. With no good reason, might I add. Arrowgames is this week and although I'm supposed to be all cheerful and pumped up about a long week of activities every night, somehow I can't bring myself to be ecstatic about this. I'm so sick of being in a sorority and bearing all these ridiculous responsibilities. This year it has been more of a burden than anything, especially financially. And then being the only sorority on campus on probation pretty much sucks ass too. I am being punished for something I did not do. It's weird to think about where I might have ended up had I gone through formal recruitment. Don't get me wrong, sometimes there are amazing moments and I'm glad that I am able to share them with my sisters. Most of the time however consists of drama and being fined. Bullshit. It is just something else to deal with. I can do it though. 

I can't wait for tomorrow and Wednesday. I get my math test back tomorrow (hopefully) and I am as confident as I have ever been about any math test. Secondly, we're filming tomorrow night. Lately, I have loved hanging out with people from the Scene. Of course, I don't feel like I ever fit in, but everyone is hilarious and it's fun to be a part of. Saturday was a blast. We had to film an opening to the TCOM Banquet and it was a parody of the scene in Anchorman where all the news stations fight each other. I brought stilettos as my weapon. Good times!

Prom is this weekend and I am actually excited! I finally found a dress... tinkerbell green.. not at all poofy, but everyone says its adorable and compliments my fair (aka PALE) complexion. The trials of being a redhead... The shoes are a tad porn-starish though.. clear and high stiletto heels. but they're adorable and weren't too expensive with Dom's discount *wink*

I should probably go hop in the shower so I'm sparkling clean for tonight. My baby's not here to impress so I'm still debating haha. 

Somehow, I can't believe any of this would be interesting to anyone else. However, it's nice to put something down as some sort of record for myself..."

"event","It's been awhile, huh. I just have been so busy lately that I can barely find time for myself. Ok Ok, really I'm just lazy. I stayed at school this weekend and it dragged on and on until I never thought it would end. Poodle spent the night Friday and we had a blast just chillin... we didn't do anything special, just watched movies all night. I was so sad when she left because I've been so homesick and lonely lately. I don't have any friends like her up here. I mean I know a lot of people that I could call and go out with but no one I could totally let loose and act retarded with. We have our own best friend langauage. It's sad, really. Thursday night was just... uhh I don't even want to think about it. I do know that I won't be drinking for awhile. I just didn't have a good experience and I realized that no matter how drunk I get I NEVER throw up. That can't be very good. I mean who likes to throw up, but I really needed to get all that shit out of my system. Needless to say, I didn't want to do anything else the rest of the weekend. So last night everyone was getting ready to go out and I was bummed cause I didn't want to just sit around but I didn't want to get drunk either. Luckily my awesome friend carrie across the hall invited me to go to late nite and I had a blast. Except for the weird Asian guy practially raping me on the dance floor. It was like that part in Sixteen Candles where the geek dances all around Sam and she starts to cry. Bleh. The rest was good though. I've been missing my bebe ALOT though. This week was especially hard and I don't know why. Hopefully I will be able to spend the weekend at home. I just need to get over this homesick feeling. Perhaps it will all go away when I see Nate. Everything with classes have been going well though. I've only missed 2 classes thus far and have turned it every piece of hw but one. Eeks. I DID get scholar of the week in Pi PHi though! I think that's pretty cool! And I got elected House Manager which means I get to assign people to clean the suite and help Juliana with recruitment AND sit in on Exec. YEAH! Things have been weird with the sorority lately. I don't feel like I'm a part of it. I don't ever see or talk to any of the other members and I'm never really invited anywhere. I just feel left out most of the time. Oh well... this too shall pass, huh. I can't wait for this week to start. Believe it or not, I'm excited for class. And I hope my baby gets his job tomorrow! And if there are some gods or a God out there somewhere...PLEASE GET NATES PSYCHO GRANDMA OFF HIS BACK> AMEN...thanks. ahah"

"event","Initiation Week starts today. Supposedly we are going to be showered with gifts all week, starting today. We were told to come to the suite after 6 to check it out. It's not like it's easy to get into the suite either. First you have to find a way to get all the way over there and then we have to find someone to let us in because our cards are not coded yet. Then the long trek up the 8 flights of stairs. So we get all the way up there and of course theere's nothing there with my name on it. Always...ALWAYS happens to me. Not even joking. For example... in high school they have announcements every day and they announce birthdays. Every year, somehow on MY birthday they didnt have announcements or the bell rang right before they said my name. It is shit like that constantly fucking me over. It just builds up after awhile. So this whole thing is not even about whether or not I got a present. It's the fact that I put time and energy into something and get SHIT for it. So fuck everything I'm going to bed.

It's Monday, again. BUH. 

Paid that reallly late parking ticket. Good news! Thought it was going to be $35 acause it was late, but I only had to pay $25. Bueno.

Got a job...but I had to get a referral which requires filling out a tax thing which requires a birth certificate or some such thing. I really do not carry those things around with me. I think I'm just pissed due to lack of common sense on my part, but I'm not sure yet.

Broke..no money.

"event","GRR i had like a whole paragraph written up and it was wonderful and then BAM somehow it gets deleted. so i guess i'm starting over...

It is approaching 2:00 and I'm just wondering where the day has gone. Of course I slept until 1:00...There are so many things on my to-do list that I can never seem to get done. I have so many things to study for. History poses no threat whatsoever; I've been taking notes and going to classes and review sessions. Sociology, on the other hand, is another story. I haven't really been going to class. I know, I know. BAD. I could pretty much teach that class to myself. The only thing is, the professor's ideas sometimes clash with the book's. So I have to know two different things about one thing. If you're not confused, you should be. LOL. 

Nate came up to see me yesterday which made me SO HAPPY!!! He brought roses.. which is makes him automatically the most incredible, amazing, wonderful forever and forever boyfriend. He also brought some chocolate cake, which I know he was wanting to eat, so of course I shared!! It is my favorite dessert, besides cherry pie MMM. And last but not least, he downloaded The Notebook off the internet and burned it on to a cd for us to watch. That is our movie because I swear Nate and I are just like Ali and Noah. *sigh* We met Sarah and Matt at IHOP for dinner and then well, we somehow ended up in the ER but I'm not getting into specifics. Everything is A-OK though...but not your typical ER visit. 

I can't tell you how much having Nate with me helped. I am always a nervous wreck in the hospital no matter the occasion. I've been to so many for so many different reasons...they just make me uncomfortable. I kept hearing this old lady across the hall coughing and it was the most horrible thing I've ever heard. I didn't know it was possible to cough like that. I wondered what her life had been like...where she's been and what she'd done. If anyone was taking care of her. People always seem to avoid taking care of sick, older relatives. Maybe they are lazy, or maybe it's just too damn sad to see someone's life slowly fade. I remember when my Mama (sounds like Maw Maw lol) was sick and she was moved to the living room of my great aunt's house. She was bedridden for so long and it took such an emotional toll on everyone. She had led such an amazing life, she was the sweetest lady ever. Everytime I saw her she said, ""Give Mama some sugar!"" And she died the day AFTER Christmas... damn. I saw her Christmas Day and could not recognize her. Why am I purposely depressing myself.. god. That's all I could think about though, when I heard that lady coughing. 

I have to shake out of this weird mood/slump..."

Ok, so what. Times are different now. Doesn't mean we love each other any less than you did at that age. or perhaps it means, i made a mistake getting married at such a young age. wait, grow, mature...well fucking DUH. i cant think.. brain is weird. no drinking tonight..."

"event","Just got back from working all the tension out of my body. Last night and today were just incredibly stressful. I used to try and forget about it until it built up and then I'd finally blow up at my family. This was what I grew up around, taking other people's shit because they had a bad day. Now I love my family, don't get me wrong. But I have been analyzing our behavior. My dad's job makes him travel all the time, so he's not home very often. My mom works too and my brother and I are just students. We were never made to really do anything around the house, I didn't grow up doing chores...my mom still makes my bed and cleans my room when I don't. She's constantly coming home from a long, tiring, and physically taxing day at work and having to clean the house, do laundry and make dinner because neither my dad or my brother will do much of anything. So immediately she's in a bad mood. My dad's excuse is, ""I work hard to bring in our income so I shouldn't have to do anything around the house."" And my bro and I are just lazy sometimes. Now that I'm gone ALOT doesnt get done. Then the yelling and arguing starts. It starts with just two people and then it spreads to everyone else until we're all pissy. Sometimes I feel like we have such a dysfunctional family. The rents never go out and do anything fun...having people over for dinner maybe once a month is about the extent of it. We never went to football games or anything as a family when we were growing up...The childhood was normal enough, as normal as anyone's can be. But sometimes I feel like we all missed out on some things. So this is all embedded in who I am right now, until I can figure out who I really am. I see these traits coming through sometimes, especially when I'm talking with Nate. If something doesn't please me or rubs me the wrong way I'll get silent. Sometimes I don't know why and if asked what is wrong, I'll say ""nothing"" and try to avoid any further conversation. This is JUST LIKE MY MOM..and I hate hate hate when she does this. She shuts people out, she always has. I'm constantly encouraging people to talk to me about their feelings, why can't I do the same?? 

Had a blast with my big sis last night. We made a pizza from scratch...you know, rolling the dough and everything. I ate sooo much. I guess I need to stop eating stuff like that if I'm serious about all this working out... We watched some tv and talked. Good times... She gave me this really cute shirt and picture frame that I immediately found the perfect picture for. It's sittin on my desk right now with  my baby's cute lil pic in it. 

So..I'm stinky and need a shower... thats it for tonight..."

"event","I have been sleeping a tremendous amount these past two days. Instead of going back to school on Sunday night, I elected to spend the night at home and leave Monday morning at 7. What in God's name was I thinking?? Have I even been up before 7 am since school started? Luckily, I had my mother, father, AND little brother to wake me up at the butt crack of dawn (6 am). Who needs an alarm when your little brother is a cannonball and foghorn all rolled into one? Hmmm?? Anyone?? *pant pant*

So anyway, I get home around 830, just in time for this mandatory 9 oclock lecture I have. Ten oclock rolls around and *BAM* I am in bed curled up in my blanket. La di da... sleeping...sleeping. Four o'clock rolls around and someone is shaking me awake. I realize that I have missed my other two classes and lunch. DAMN!! Lunch is important!! Suffice it to say, I should have gotten enough sleep. But it is now 1:00 and I have just rolled my moldy ass out of bed. Thankfully, it is still lunch time. And I didn't miss any classes. Yea.. *cough*. 

I have a paper due today, too. I wrote the rough draft but it was one of those BS rough drafts where I wrote some shit to make it look like I had something. The funny thing is, the peer editors liked it. Hehe. I know I have to tweak it here and there but I'm not going to spend too much time on it. Professor Zhang said she gets nicer as the semester wears on. Oh yes, get this! My ENGLISH professor is CHINESE. Not that I have anything against the chinese, but she can barely speak our langauge, let alone teach it. Needless to say, I was pissed my first couple of weeks in that class. I mean she introduced herself for half an hour because she was trying to teach us how to pronounce her name. And then she read roll for another 10 minutes, trying to figure out how to prounounce OUR names. AHH. At least the semester is rapidly approaching its end. 

I'm excited for tonight because my Big Sis, Juliana, and I are going out to dinner!! I haven't seen her for awhile because I'm always going home. I was really happy to find out she was my big because I always have a blast with her. I wish we got to see each other more often.. not just to go out but talk too. LALALALA

Anyways...it is election day. I want it to be over... I haven't been outside yet today but I'm sure once I step out into the open I'll be bombarded with flyers from every direction and party. I did not vote this year and there are a few reasons why. First of all, I don't back either candidate 100%. Of course, I don't really back Kerry at all... I have been bred and raised Republican. But outside of that, I've done my own research. And I still back Bush over Kerry. I""m not going to get into this and  that because it is VERY OLD. Everyone has their own opinion and is trying to get it out there. All I have to say is VOTE BUSH.

And, I think I'll let that be all for today... maybe more later tonight? Not sure yet. Alls I know is that I have to finish this damn paper and actually study for once. BLAH"

"event","So here we go, day number one. Definitely not the first to say this, but who knew I would ever join one of these livejournal things? I mean really, I have been pouring my heart out to my dear diaries since kindergarten. The first diary I ever received was small, purple, and had a lock and key. A 6 year old's secrets are very personal... 

At any rate, I've been reading a few of my friend's journals and they were beginning to piss me off. Instead of ranting and raving at them, I thought I'd let it out here. One of my ""acqauintances"" was talking about true love and how he doesn't believe it exists. For those out there who have never experienced it, I'm sure this is the case. He was talking about those petty and meaningless relationships that are centered around sex and how the couple say things like, ""Baby, even though we've only been fucking for two days now, I know I love you... this is TRUE LOVE!!"" Sure people like that give true love a bad name and make them look super ignorant. But let me tell you that you cannot base your perception of love off of other people's. Everyone thinks of it differently, there is no set definition...it's useless to analyze it. The reason I became so upset at reading this was because it was so cynical. Personally, I feel like I know what true love is. My boyfriend and I have been best friends since sixth grade and we started dating a year and a half ago. Aww...what a fairy tale..lol whatever. I know not everybody has lived down the road from their high school sweetheart, but it doesn't mean they love each other any less or more. I dont know... it just upset me because I know he has never had a sound relationship, let alone one that would let him know what love means. He shouldn't knock what he hasn't experienced. Someday his cynical view of love may make him miss his true love. If he believes in it by then."

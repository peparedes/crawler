"event","last night was so odd
greg (who lives at kings collage he's the drunk guy from the beginning of the 2nd semester for all those uni ppl who were there) is staying at collage over the holidays which means he has the run of the entire collage which is awsome coz free gym and pool and stuff for me but for the next 11 days they lock the doors to everything coz theres no staff there just like 4 students. Anyway abi me rufus and k dawg went there last night for abit of a tool sesh and we were hungry so we mished down to subway in st lucia and patty was working there...score for the cheap sandwiches but anyway he was cutting bread and he cut himself and was bleeding though like 3 bandaids and had to wear 3 sets of gloves so dodgy but anyway then rufus got food poisoning from the sandwiches which is hilarious lol so he and k dawg went home but coz there were no other beds abi and i had to fashion a bed out of these cushions we ripped off couches and chairs in gregs room and they kept sliding around everytime one of us moved so bad anyway when we finally fell asleep we slept for like a couple of hours only to wake up to greg who had to leave at freakin 6 am to go visit is grandma GAH oh well i think he told us not to steal his booze so we stole his bread and coke and bed sheets *shakes fist at greg take that*

merry xmas or whatever you do

"event","oh god.....in the space of 15 mins today i saw three examples of why humanity will forever be stuck on this world.

1. A car driving with its boot open and all this crap falling out. THE BOOT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY OPEN like if you had bothered to glance into ANY of your rear vision mirrors AND I MEAN ANY you could have seen that this thing was open *shakes head* idiot.

2. A person trying to buy a train ticket by shoving a note into the coin return.........ok yeah this one doesn't even need to be commented on.....it speaks for its self...and no this guy wasn't ""differently abled"" to be politically correct

3. 2 chicks who CAN'T sing catawalling some bollocks song on the train at the top of their lungs.......had to turn music up so far it hurt to get rid of them made me wanna cry

and that is the joy which is the foolishness we live within......*tear* at least it gave me a good laugh"

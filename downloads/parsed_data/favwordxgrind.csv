"event","I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah

And you're gonna think of me
Oh someday baby, someday"

"event","Have you ever felt a kiss,
not on your lips, but in your heart?
I have.
Have you ever felt a hug, so warm and strong
that nothing else mattered and you never want to let go?
I have.
When I looked at you, I saw a part of myself.
And when I said goodbye, I never got it back.

I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter any more, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you."

The back of your head keeps getting hit by the toilet seat.

The parking lot seems to have moved while you were in the bar

When you go to donate blood and they ask what proof?

You think the Four Basic Food Groups are Caffeine, Nicotine, Alcohol, and Hotties.

You have a ""happy hour"" at home

When you are sober, people ask you what's wrong?

You spend all night making a board game called Alcohol Land

Although you drove home the other night you can't remember how you got home or where you parked your car

""Hi ocifer. I'm not under the affluence of incohol.""

Your favorite drink is ethanol.

""Why does everybody think I have a prinking droblem?! - I don't have a prinking droblem!""

""I don't have a drinking prob..pleb..prub.. *hic* Pash me another, tarbender.""

You can spend a whole night holding up walls to prevent their (your) collapse.

You instinctively know where the alcohol is in a store you've never been in before

Clubs raise their drink prices because you haven't attended in a while

You think beer and ramen make a good breakfast

You frequently urinate outdoors.

When you first wake up and you're afraid you're gonna die and a half-hour later you're afraid you won't.

You fall asleep taking a dump.

You believe that spilling a beer is alcohol abuse.

You go to the john to hurl, but you take your beer with you.

You find it's easier to study drunk.

You're on a first name basis at the detoxification center.

Beer ads make sense.

You wake up to the sound of your dog drinking out of the toilet and you're so dry that it sounds mighty thirst quenching.

You wake the next morning and start drinking a few of the half empties left sitting around the room.

The space on your driver's license that tells your eye color reads ""bloodshot"".

You fall down a flight of steps and DON'T spill a drop of your beer.

You mix your cocktails by the litre.

You grow a beard because it stops beer that's running down your chin.

You put off urinating in hopes of reaching that near orgasmic Zen-like piss.

When the bottle says 20 standard drinks but you only get 5.

You spell Alcohol with a capital letter out of respect

You lose arguments with inanimate objects.

You have to hold onto the lawn to keep from falling off the earth

Your career won't progress beyond Senator from Massachusettes.

24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case - coincidence?? - I think not!

Two hands and just one mouth... - now THAT'S a drinking problem!

""Norm!"" is what they say when you enter the bar.

You can focus better with one eye closed

The parking lot seems to have moved while you were in the bar

You fall off the floor.

You discover in the morning that liquid cleaning supplies have mysteriously disappeared.

Hey, 5 beers has just as many calories as a burger, screw dinner!

Beer: it's not just for breakfast anymore.

The glass keeps missing your mouth.

Vampires get woozy after bitting you.

At AA meeting you begin: ""Hi, my name is... uh...""

Your idea of cutting back is less seltzer.

You wake up in the bedroom, your underwear is in the bathroom, you fell asleep clothed. - hmm.

Every night you're beginning to find your roomate's cat more and more attractive.

If you're on a diet, you cut back your food calories to allow for alcohol calories.

""Take me drunk, I'm home!""

You wake up naked lying in the corner of a bus depot.

You drink to get over a hangover.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends who drink too much."

"event","If I knew it would be the last time 
That I'd see you fall asleep, 
I would tuck you in more tightly 
and pray the Lord, your soul to keep. 

If I knew it would be the last time 
that I see you walk out the door, 
I would give you a hug and kiss 
and call you back for one more. 

If I knew it would be the last time 
I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise, 
I would video tape each action and word, 
so I could play them back day after day. 

If I knew it would be the last time, 
I could spare an extra minute 
to stop and say ""I love you,"" 
instead of assuming you would KNOW I do. 

If I knew it would be the last time 
I would be there to share your d! ay, 
Well I'm sure you'll have so many more, 
so I can let just this one slip away. 

For surely there's always tomorrow 
to make up for an oversight, 
and we always get a second chance 
to make everything just right. 

There will always be another day 
to say ""I love you,"" 
And certainly there's another chance 
to say our ""Anything I can do?"" 

But just in case I might be wrong, 
and today is all! I get, 
I'd like to say how much I love you 
and I hope we never forget. 

Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, 
young or old alike, 
And today may be the last chance 
you get to hold your loved one tight. 

So if you're waiting for tomorrow, 
why not do it today? 
For if tomorrow never comes, 
you'll surely regret the day, 

That you didn't take that extra time 
for a smile, a hug, or a kiss 
and you were too busy to grant someone, 
what turned out to be their one last wish. 

So hold your loved ones close today, 
and whisper in their ear, 
Tell them how much you love them 
and that you'll always hold them dear 

Take time to say ""I'm sorry,"" 
""Please forgive me,"" ""Thank you,"" or ""It's okay."" 
And if tomorrow never comes, 
you'll have no regrets about today."

I want to remember everything that i do and ever tiny detail that goes through my head so that i can <FONT color=#33ccff>cherish </FONT>everything...</P>
<P>So I last left out and we had just finished our last day of high school so that friday I had my <FONT color=#cc66cc>Graduation/ Birthday Party </FONT>which turned out to be nothing like i had expected but it really brought me back with some friends and that was worth everything else that went on. <FONT color=#ff6600>I hate to admit it, but i need them</FONT>. So that was my party but it was a <FONT color=#33ff33>good night.</FONT></P>
<P>then, the next night was <FONT color=#6666cc>erica's party </FONT>which was a lot of fun too, quiet cause it was mostly family which was nice because i got to spend more time with my <FONT color=#cc0000>good friends </FONT>rather than just hanging out with a bunch of people that <FONT color=#ffcccc>i couldnt care less </FONT>about at some other party or something. Oh yes, and we all found out what a <FONT color=#ffffff>snitch</FONT> mrs lunny is OMG! she tells everything and shit and she told <EM>my mom</EM> about me and tyler and blabbed about <U>brittney</U> and how <FONT color=#6600cc>she went to a hotel after <STRONG>prom</STRONG> </FONT>and she even got all the fucking facts wrong so if your going to get us in trouble, at least get us in trouble for something that we actually did!&nbsp; So now we all have to watch our backs with that cause who knows, i mean i am not going to be on <FONT size=4>girls gone wild</FONT> or anything (well not that i am planning on ;-)) but i mean, still, i dont need my parents or anyone else to know what i do with my spare time, <FONT size=4>that is my business!</FONT> oh yes, and it was baccalaureate mass and it was really pretty.

Uhm and, okay. So then I went to the Gonzalez residence and ended up staying all through <FONT color=#ffcc66>desperate house wives</FONT> and i have no further comments to share on such a visit.</P>
<P>Monday- <FONT color=#cc66cc>Senior Breakfast</FONT><BR>Well, <FONT color=#339999>we had skits we had slide shows we had music... we had food?</FONT> lol. okay we did but it was bad. So the skit was fucking hilarious!! They did a <FONT color=#009900>history of all our homecomings and cailinis </FONT>through the years and everything that had happened and it was just really funny. very well done. Lizzy Klein, Allen Carmody, Chelsea, and Stephanie Moran (i am sure some of those names were butchered- i apologize) and then the slide show <FONT color=#ff99ff>which was just fun because you never realize how much people grow up in 4 years and then you look at the pictures and its like WHAT. WHOA! who is that!! </FONT>ahhhh! those were the highlights of that lovely day.</P>
<P>Tuesday- May 17th.<FONT color=#000099> Graduation Day</FONT><BR>we had rehearsal that morning which was no big deal at all they just basically tell us not to trip and make asses out of ourselves. And then i went home and started getting ready for that night. <FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>So graduation came and went. I took my turn to walk across the big stage, shake father kelly's hand and take my empty diploma holder :-)</FONT> And then i went out to dinner with my family plus bernard and my grandparents and the <FONT color=#ff6600>gonzalez family</FONT> and cough brandon. And then when i got home and <FONT color=#6600cc size=4>Chasen came over and we hung out for a while... it was good to see him again.

"event","These are some of the final days that i will be living in South Florida and each day has a something different... now that i am out of high school there are a lot of new things going on and a lot of things that i will do for the last time and its all pretty overwhelming but i am really excited to be starting something new. I still have 3 weeks before i offically leave and i am already missing everyone and everything about my home and my family and my friends. But i will be coming home every once in a while and i will get the chance to see everyone and that will make it worth waiting for. I couldnt wait to leave because of all the crap that this town holds over me, but its funny cause just as i am about to leave everything has been able to fall into place with the exception of somethings that will never have a final place. And i hope that is because it has a place in my future... (journals suck because no matter what you write everything changes as you write so there can be entries that just never get finished because you would just continue to write forever)

... and once again i must continue at a later date. so long for now."

"event","Who knew this day would actually come.
Today I completed my final day at St. Thomas Aquinas High School.  High School was everything I could have hoped it to be. Sometimes I failed and sometimes I succeeded but all around I see myself to have been blessed with some of the greatest memories and some awesome friends.  The next week is going to be absolutely insane! Just the next 2 days alone is! Ahhh there is so much to do in so little time but i am going to manage and they are going to be some of the best days of my life! Unfortionately some of the people that used to be so close to me are going to miss it but i know that even if i dont see them before I leave in a month, someday somewhere we will meet on the street in 10 years or so and we will remenis about all the good times we had together.  In these few days alone i have felt life become a little more real.  I can actually feel myself making better decisions, i hope. My life is going to change so much and i can't wait to start it.  It hardly seems real that today was our last day.  4 years felt like a day but i am thankful for everyone of the days i had.  And now i get to open a new chapter of my life at UF next year and i cant wait.  

(this one was just a quickie I hope to actually get to update again soon)-- but who knows with the next few days pure madness

3 days till my birthday- finally legal."

"event","<P>Wow, i have not updated in almost a month! definitely some kind of record. Life has just been so overwhelming that I haven't wanted to post an update for the feeling that it would be too whiny and <STRONG>""whoe is me""</STRONG> and sympathy and crap is the last thing i need.</P>
<P>Well, first i want to start with all the somewhat juicy stuff from<FONT color=#cc33cc> spring break...</FONT></P>
<P>Two weeks ago this coming tuesday, Kristen, EMIG, Brandon, Chreeez, and I went to <FONT color=#ff0000>sweet tomatoes </FONT>to eat dinner which was rather enjoyable- it was exactly what i needed.&nbsp; It was just a shame that Brittney and Katie didn't want to join us, but that is their thing. And then we drove all the way out to the <FONT color=#339999>movies</FONT>, just to discover that there were no movies and since we had <FONT color=#ccffff>unofficial school </FONT>the next day, staying out was not the best idea, so we ended up renting <FONT color=#33cc00>Donnie Darko</FONT>, which was uhm... quite weird, but at the same time. rather enjoyable. OMG and Chris let my drive<FONT color=#333399> the stang</FONT>... i stalled pretty dirty quite a few times but i was really trying hard :-D it was <FONT color=#cc9933>a-w-e-s-o-m-e!!!</FONT></P>
<P>So then, Wednesday, <FONT color=#999900><STRONG>RING DAY MASS</STRONG></FONT>... which was mass and then we had our rings blessed which was a little different than i thought they were going to do it but it was all good... and they also announced <FONT color=#ff6600>senior superlatives </FONT>and normally i would list them all and stuff but since this is a week and a half late, obviously i don't remember them all plus there were sooo many and it was just crazy but i am pretty much happy with everyone that got them. for the most part, they deserved them.&nbsp; And then kristen, katie, laura and i went out to <FONT color=#990000>brunch </FONT>and somewhere along the way we picked up mr. lunny? uhm, i'm not sure how that all worked. Anyways, then i came home and just hung out for a few hours. Then when mommy dearest got off work, we went prom shoe shopping, and unfortionately had no luck, but uhm, i did end up getting two pairs of shoes anyways, haha!<FONT color=#ffcccc> i love to shop con mi madre. </FONT>her treat :-D And then we went to <FONT color=#6666cc>Sean's ""little"" party </FONT>haha, that was broken up before 9 o'clock because almost literally EVERY junior and senior showed up, like wtf! haha, but it was cool cause then we went to Durini's and then to Danielle's which all turned out to be busts so Dewey and I ended up going home and watching <FONT color=#ffcc33>Butteryfly Effect</FONT>, but at curfew we were just getting to the part where i had left off the first time, lol... craziness!</P>
<P><U>Thursday-</U> I woke up, hung around the house and did nothing cause it had to be completely dedicated to packing day! <FONT size=4>w00t w00t.</FONT> but then i had to run a few errands to return so <FONT color=#cccccc>prom shoes </FONT>that my mom had tried to buy me but didnt fit and i had to get stuff to bake a little something for SOS. but then, after i get all purdy, i get in my <FONT color=#ffff00>smoldering hot car</FONT> to leave, it decides to be a bitch and not work... go figure! and i had to get the ingredients to bake the brownies so i decided to roller skate to winn dixie. so i do that, an hour later i get home, bake the shit, try to start the car... it starts <FONT color=#ff99ff>(afraid to use my car)</FONT> i delivered the brownies to <FONT color=#ff0000>SOS</FONT> and do my other errands. <FONT color=#3366ff>Praying</FONT> everytime i had to leave somewhere that it would actually start. no problems, so i go back home and actually start to pack, being a thursday and having an early start and most of my friends being out of town, i watched the <FONT color=#ff9900>OC.</FONT> and then went sleepies.</P>
<P>Friday- <FONT color=#cc33cc>5 am wake up call</FONT>. i get up, get dressed, at the airport by 7,<FONT color=#99ff99> ""i'm flyin on a jetplane, don't know when i'll be back again</FONT>"" so then we go through Salt Lake City... and finally arrive in San Francisco at around 12 their time (3 pm) our time --<FONT color=#6600cc> 3 hour time difference.&nbsp;</FONT> So... then we check in and just tour the town. The first day we are there, my parents drag me throught the <EM>ghetto</EM>, where there are <FONT color=#66cccc>bums </FONT>sleeping on the sidewalk, i saw a whore carrying around a bag of hair, and a woman with tears streaming down her face, I had had enough and wanted to come home! <FONT color=#3366ff>It absolutely broke my heart! </FONT>so then we got <FONT color=#ffffcc>noodles</FONT> (notice that nice transition from whores to noodles, subtle, i know) and then we went to the hotel and chilled for the afternoon.</P>
<P><EM>Saturday- </EM>we met cheryl and mo for breakfast on the street, and then the <FONT color=#9999ff>mama and little </FONT>one went and played golf and<FONT color=#33ccff> camille and daddy</FONT> drove around town, <FONT color=#009900>got some good pictures :-) </FONT>and went through <FONT color=#ffcc33>china town </FONT>and we got to see a little show that i got on video cause its really cool to see.&nbsp; So then, we went to pick up bob and mama from the course and we played the last few holes with them with these really cool guys, and clay won like <FONT color=#33ff33>30 smackers</FONT>, not bad, not bad at all. So that was that, and then I about my hand cause i was so hungry... <FONT color=#ff6666>end of story.</FONT></P>
<P>Sunday- <FONT color=#ccccff size=5>Happy Easter!!</FONT> We went to a cute little church which was actually the first meeting place for St. Vincent de Paul. It was a really pretty chruch. It was on the corner of <FONT color=#33cc00>California and Grant</FONT>. tehe <FONT color=#006600>(michelle and i remember weird stuff like that- where did i stay in the keys? mile marker 74 and a half!) w00t.</FONT> hella good times. so then we met cheryl for brunch at a cute little place after driving around for almost an HOUR looking for f**kin parking. wtf! and then we got the grand tour of everyplace cause it was all so <FONT color=#cc66cc>gorgeous.</FONT> but it rained most of the day and we went down the curviest road in the <FONT color=#ff0000>US of A.</FONT>&nbsp; Then we met Mo for some dinner and it was all delicious but by the end of the day i was beat tired!!</P>
<P><STRONG>Monday-</STRONG>We drove up to <FONT color=#330099>Cheryl's house </FONT>which was rather far away and we went to <FONT color=#66ffff>Ocean Avenue </FONT>and went to lunch which was so cute! and then we went to <FONT color=#cc0000>Carmel</FONT> (the shopping center that Ocean Avenue drives through) and <FONT color=#009900>i got a new Coach Hat </FONT>for a reasonable price (dont gimme bull its real cause it was a coach store bitches!) so then we went to <FONT color=#66cccc>Pebble Beach </FONT>to make senior pepe happy and he had a gay ol' time, some hotties there, but you know... wrong place, wrong time. :-\ but i deal, and then we took the 17 mile drive holy fucking eh it was <FONT color=#cc9933><U>GORGEOUS!!</U></FONT> and i got some <FONT color=#ff6600>spectacular pictures!! </FONT>and then we took the LONG ASS DRIVE back to Cheryl's to drove off our tour guide. And went back to the hotel area in San Fran.</P>
<P>Tuesday- we drove through BFE to get to <FONT color=#009900><EM>Nappa Valley </EM></FONT>so see all the vineyards and it was soo very <FONT color=#6633ff>gorgeous but insanely crazy </FONT>how long it took us to get there, but how can you go to <FONT color=#ff6600>good ol' cali </FONT>and not see it, it was definitely a sight.</P>
<P><STRONG>Wednesday-</STRONG> We met Mo at work (btw he works for the <FONT color=#cc0000>San Francisco 49ers)</FONT> which was rather neat getting a whole private tour of the stadium and everything *brushes off shoulder* so then bobo went to play gold with Cheryl and Mo for the day and mama and daddy and i did some shopping- dont mind if I do. We did <FONT color=#cc9933>China town </FONT>and looked at all the cheap crap in all the stores, <FONT color=#cccccc>unbelievable! </FONT>and mommy bought me a <FONT color=#99ff99>really cute dress </FONT>for graduation or the fashion show or SOMETHING! who knows when it will actually get worn! But then we drove to <FONT color=#999900>Half- Moon Bay</FONT> in BFE where Cheryl lives to get Clay from golf at the <FONT color=#6666cc>Ritz- Carlton </FONT>and we had some food there which was really pretty which i picked out what i <FONT color=#ff0000>LOVED</FONT> in the<FONT color=#33ccff> Tiffany's Cateloge </FONT>(hey, dont judge me- you would have too!) and so we went to Cheryl and Mo's for dinner which was <FONT color=#333399>absolutely to DIE FOR </FONT>and we met their friend who seemed like a nice guy but he wasn't married, rather odd.. i dunno i never really figured him out, but I did get to see Cheryl (who used to work for the <FONT color=#cc0000>49ers</FONT>) and Mo's 5 <FONT color=#ff99ff size=4>Superbowl rings</FONT> and all i really have to say is HOLY CRAP and was a lot of <FONT color=#99ffff>bling.</FONT> thats all! </P>
<P>Thursday- <FONT color=#ccccff>the last and Final official day in San Francisco</FONT>... we went down to <FONT color=#ffcc00>Peer 48 </FONT>which was a cute little place sorta like our Las Olas? we had food and went on the Trolly car which was a lot of fun and got to look at all the venders. There are very interesting people in San Francisco... but then we went back to the hotel to chill out for a while and then we went shopping some more. oh twist my arm!... and this time i<FONT color=#cc33cc><U> got a new jacket omg </U></FONT>that i am completely in<FONT color=#ff0000> LOOOVE </FONT>with and i got a sweater which was just a necessity for my other dress for graduation... other wise well, we all know good ol' <FONT color=#333399>STA.</FONT>&nbsp; So then by then we were all exhausted and we retired for the night to the <FONT color=#6600cc>h</FONT><FONT color=#6600cc>otel</FONT> to pack up all our shit that was spread all over the entire two hotel rooms. <FONT color=#ffff99>like omg it was crazy</FONT>. it took me less time packing at home! whoa now.</P>
<P>Friday- <FONT color=#ffcc66>Flew ALL day</FONT>, got home at 9ish... too tired to function. basically went to sleep. </P>
<P>Saturday- unpacked returned to normal people life, went out with <FONT color=#3333ff>Brad</FONT> which was a nice change since i hadnt seen him in almost a year but at the same time was kinda hard because well, when you see someone that often and you just get one of those vibes its kinda awkward. i dunno he is sweet as hell but i'm not so sure about him, and he kinda wanted to hang out some more and hopefully respectable but either way i declined because i just was tired and couldnt deal with that any longer, and we all know what happens when you see two movies in a row- you dont watch the second one, sometimes not even the first! but thats besides the point. We saw <U>Guess who</U> in theatres... not highly recommended. but it ends with a <FONT color=#ff6600><STRONG>HAPPY ENDING </STRONG></FONT>and thats all that matters to me, as long as it does, i am a happy girl. So then i ended up calling another <U>old friend and bonding</U> for a little while which was niice cause i hadnt seen them to bond in a while, but at the same time it was just like old times. I love how you can leave someone and you know that they will be the same person when you see them again, I hope thats how it is if i meet someone i know now in 20 years or so from now. </P>
<P><U>Sunday-</U> Back to School Mode unfortionately, doing all that crappy school work and stuff but successfully avoided it most of the day. <FONT color=#33ccff>Desperate House Wives </FONT>w00t w00t. hell yes -- i am offically addicted. and i'm okay with that. tehe</P>
<P>(This is where i should end cause i am about to pass out but despite what i should be doing, i'm going to continue)</P>
<P>Monday- We had mass for <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Jenny (for those of you who are unaware on Friday, March 23rd-- we lost a member of our Senior STA Family) so please pray for Jenny King and her family.&nbsp;</STRONG></FONT> It hurts to lose someone that was a part of you. But life must go on and as it did. So then we had student council after school. Life continues to go back to normal and then i went to the mall and got my <FONT color=#990000>PROM SHOES,</FONT> yessss.... and then got two more dresses for occassions. :-D i loove it! and that was monday</P>

The sun is shining brightly, the sun is singing it's great
It's the beginning of a good day
Good things are gonna happen I can tell
I'm gonna hang out with my friends
I'm looking at a good day, well...


I take it easy, there's no rush, the day ahead is all mine
Might watch some TV, but whatever, I'll take my time
It's the middle of a good day
Good things are gonna happen I can tell
I'm gonna hang out with my friends
I'm looking at a good day, well...


The day has done me well, it's time to go out now
Gonna go and see my friends, that's all I wanna do and how
Good food and good company, relaxation and a sense of being at peace


The day is over now, I'm still feeling mighty fine
My friends mean a lot to me, I can only look forward to the next time
It's the end of a good day
Good things have happened I can tell
I've hung out with my friends
I'm looking at a good day, well...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I can't and won't make the same mistake again, i can't make it twice.  I lost you once and that was enough for me.  but since i dont know what went wrong the first time, i don't know what to do differently, but all i know is that it wasnt over and this time somehow i will do things differently cause i am fighting for what i want this time!But it did have an AWESOME day... i was on cloud 9 :-) because i was with YOU. 

Its funny how things can change so quickly."

"event","This is going to be a montage of a lot of random shit... so here we go...


... get ready for the ride of your life...

Isn't it funny how you can see yourself in certain characters.  We read this book in class called a streetcar named desire, heard of it? anyways, well i didn't understand it, until tonight.  Its the story of a woman who was a doll at heart and is forced to live with her sister because she had lost everything after losing her parent's place and after losing her job by having an affair with one of her students and after whoring herself to many men at the hour-rate hotels. but in the end her sister sends her away to the funny farm as we like to call it because she didn't want to believe that her husband had raped her- which he had.  But don't judge, because looks can be deceiving. Society can change a person, if they feel violated enough and lost enough to do the extreme.  I can see myself in her. Take that as you choose, but i seem to get everything that I don't want, she didn't want to sleep with all those men but she was searching for herself... ""i always did rely on the kindness of strangers"" she went from man to man searching to find the other part of her. Unlike her, i have a different approach of handling things, but i can completely and totally relate to her.  The one thing she wanted, she couldn't have.  She had been married to a young man but she later found out that he was gay, and she approached him the wrong way about it and he ended up killing himself because of what she said.  She had truly loved him and she was trying to find the missing piece in herself to fill.  I have realized that I once had everything i ever wanted and i just never realized it, and i am a big believer in the old saying that if its meant to be it will be, but in the mean time, shit is fucking hard.  Life basically sucks.  I gave up everything! 

Time heals all.  

""Pretty girl is suffering while he confesses everything... thats what you get for falling again, you can never get HIM out of your head."" -SC

...and no matter what, even if we meet again some day on the street corner as two friends, life will never be as it was on those fine summer days. Summer does some crazy shit to people. life changing shit, not only life changing but it can change who you are.

Every decision you make can change your life.  Even the smallest decision can alter your life forever, which is why i HATE making decisions. 

I think i am having a panic attack and i am scaring myself. SAVE ME AND DONT LET ME SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS. IM NOT STRONG ANYMORE. my KNEES are WEAK. Your shoulder is not where i belong, but instead under the heal of HIS (the big guy's) foot. 

""It's killing me gently, silently...""- SC 
(the only thing that will save me- the music. let the music play on FOREVER)

I cried for you tonight, did you think about me? 
as i wiped away my tears, you wiped away the liquor from you lips and laughed with a little chuckle with the friends you surround yourself with. I slept with the tear filled pillows i surround myself with. 

You have stolen my heart, but i will never let you steal my spirit.

I will forever live in the pictures."

"event","<P>okay, so thursday nothing really interesting happened. I spent the <STRONG>night</STRONG> in cause i hadnt done that in a really long time and i just needed to recover from the past week of pure insanity... but i got a chance to finish my <FONT color=#009900>painting </FONT>which turned out rather well so i am really happy. We'll see what mrs. keane says on tuesday. <FONT color=#cc33cc>professional </FONT>criticizm... <FONT color=#999900>it can be a mother fucking bitch!</FONT>&nbsp; but anyways...</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>Friday </FONT></STRONG>i woke up and had to drive mother to BFE just cause like she didnt have a car and what not so i did all that. and then i came home and watched <FONT color=#6600cc>The Notebook </FONT>which i must say was adorable. And then i just hung around here and did shit that had to be done before friday night. And then i had my hair appt at 2:30 and then nails at 3 which was such a treat cause i never get my <FONT color=#cc33cc>nails done </FONT>but i messed a few of them up and had to have the lady fix them and i felt so bad!! :-( and i saw jenna there getting all beautified and what not and we chatted for a while which is kinda weird for us, which it shouldnt be but thats a whole other topic. and then i went home and finished doing my <FONT color=#ffccff>makeup</FONT> and everything cause bernard was coming at 6:30 and then <FONT color=#6600cc>nicole and amanda </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>bernard </FONT>came over and we took pictures and everything which was quite the change from the girl group pictures and what not. and then we headed down there and we went to the dance and everything, we sat with <FONT color=#66cccc>jenna greg danielle oscar lindsey alex (her date) sean spence and his date</FONT>(have no idea her name but apparently she goes to our school- trippy) and then afterwards we went to danielle's condo but only hung out there for a while cause i was exhausted but that was just fine cause i had to drive <FONT color=#ff0000>mr. bernard </FONT>home to BFE which was okay. so that was my oh so wonderful <FONT color=#ff9900>cotillion </FONT>night...</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Saturday</FONT></STRONG> i didnt wake up till like 1ish which i dont think i have hardly ever done. <U>weeeeird.</U> and i basically just lounged around the house cause well, i didnt really have any energy to do anything else other than that.&nbsp; but i caught up with some people that i hadnt talked to in forever and a day which was really good. i talked to trevor and apparently he had a <FONT color=#66cccc>weird dream </FONT>about me the other day and i was just like oookay... and we were talking about next year and everything which should be a lot of fun cause i will finally get to know <FONT color=#ff0000>trevor </FONT>on a different level other than our family friend level and we can be just friends. cause sometimes its just awkward, we were talking back on thanksgiving break and kinda getting to know each other better but it felt really weird. hopefully it wont feel as weird. and then i called<FONT color=#ff0000> brittney</FONT> later that night and she and i hung out and we went to the girls state <FONT color=#000099>soccer game </FONT>which was a lot of fun. we won 3-0 (<FONT color=#ffffff>just something else for good ol' STA to brag about</FONT>) which they can rightfully do but come on, it totally gets old. but anyways and then there was a huge disgrpency with who was going where with who and everything and i was just like fuck this! and brittney and i picked up some ice cream and chilled here which was so much better. we started to watch <FONT color=#999900>my best friends wedding </FONT>for the 90 kagillionth time because <STRONG>i love it!!</STRONG> but i fell asleep so brittney told me to go sleepies. </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33cc00>Sunday-</FONT></STRONG> brittney and i woke up and went to the beach and were supposed to meet up with a bunch of people but due to lack of fucking parking we couldnt and just ended up chilling further south.&nbsp; And on our way there you are never going to believe what we saw (drum roll please!...) we saw the <FONT color=#33cc00>ROOM RAIDERS VAN</FONT>... i thought i was going to die. so naturally. we followed it. <STRONG>YES, we followed it.</STRONG> so then we realize they are following the <STRONG>black&nbsp;SUV</STRONG> that the other person rides in (i hope you have seen the show- cause i love it) and then the guys realzied that we were following them so we just left but the <U>camerman</U> got out of the car and everything OMG it was sooo funny and so much fun! omg it was unbelievable! so then we just hung out on the beach and ended up going to eat and <FONT color=#ff6600>cheeseburger cheeseburger </FONT>and ran into some friends there which was kinda random. and then we ate (total play by play) and then we walked down to where everyone was supposed to be so that was uhm, odd? and then we left and i came home and got all cleaned up. realized how completely<FONT color=#ff0000> burned </FONT>i am. which i am okay with. and then... i hung out with <FONT color=#3333ff>dewey and greg</FONT> and we went and got stuff and then we went to be b-ball fields to just <FONT color=#ffff33>chill</FONT> and then we went to <FONT color=#009900>kyle</FONT>'s house and started to watch the butterfly effect which was weird and i wish i had gotten to see the rest of it but total whatever i guess. Man, its weird when you can tell that someone likes you when you hug them and then when you go to walk away they give you that extra squeeze cause they dont want to let go. random thought. not completely but whatever. <FONT color=#cc33cc>""I love how when i hug her, even in public i dont have to let go right away, she lets me hold her however long I want..."" -My Best Friends Wedding.</FONT> so then as we were leaving kyle's we drove past a van and good ol' dewey who was the drunkest one in the car thinks that we just passed DDs car, so just to humor him i turn around and floor it to drive past these <FONT color=#6633ff>nice poor people</FONT>, well it turns out that the nice poor people floor it too and drive around so we catch up to them, obviously cause my car rocks (sarcasm) but we did catch them. and what the fuck do you know, it really was DD which andrew T and someone else, cause <FONT color=#009900>dewey </FONT>was the only one who got out of the car to say hi. and dewey tells us that DD thought we were the cops... what had they been doing?! hmmm... so anyways that was basically that.&nbsp; and that has been my weekend thus far. hopefully tomorrow will be entertaining as well. <FONT color=#ff0000>kisses!</FONT></P>"

4. Hey, you must've been doin' about 125 mph to keep up with me. Good job!

11. I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there are no other
cars around.. That's how far ahead of me they are. 

12. When the Officer says ""Gee ..Your eyes look red, have you been drinking?"" You probably shouldn't respond with,""Gee Officer your eyes look glazed, have you been eating doughnuts?"""

After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you.

"event","I have basically come to the conclusion that i am pretty much able to only update once a week cause thats about all i have time for.

This week basically consisted of cheerleading, Cailini, and one night to myself which pretty much picks up the pieces of my life that the other nights fuck over. And as for sundays, baby forget about it. Friday- emig, brandon, andrew, andrew's invislbe date, carly, and larry (new kids on the block) went to see boogeyman. it was good. i was at the edge of my seat... or killing dewey lol good times. then we hit up steak-n-shake... and finally went to markam for some party which was ookay. we got pulled over by the fucking park ranger who of course those people dont get hired unless they have dickhead under special personality disorders on their hiring application. i swear! as for saturday after like a kizillion hours of sleep since i am fighting off bitching colds.  emig and i shopped for my cotillion dress which was a complete no go. emig bought my ring... mofo! but i am cool with it. i mean we are twins! DUH! lol (good times) and we went out to dinner with my parents and then drove around (against her mother's plea since ""its just weird"") LOL and then we tried to find some cool people to hang out with, but they just dont exsist. its a rather sad story. but whatever. we ended up watching armegedon (sp?) and it was good since i hadnt seen it like a 100 years but i jet out on the end. sorry erica :-( but it was fun.

Gainsville this weekend!!! Erica- GET THE TICKETS!! PLEASE!

As for this week, ladies and gentlemen, the LAST game of the basketball season (that i have to cheer at, at least. w00t w00t) so thats an awesome thing. Tuesday- TAKE ACTION TOUR... here i come bitches!! omg its gonna rock. 3rd wheel but im okay with that. Wednesday- Cailini and money makin. Thursday- hopefully one night to just hang and not much shit to do but whatever i have totally learned to deal. and thats my week... and cotillion count down 12 days. 

oh and in other news. starting line concert and apparently jenna's party on the same night? hm. what to do, what to do. so thats all dangling by a string.

And now off to do 3 hours of economics homework because mr. williams is obviously out of his mind. i wonder what he was like as a teenager?! not like that was very long ago. hm, so was he one of those smart nerdy kids that got pushed into lockers? maybe not (cause hes so hot) but he sure as hell didnt have shit to do on the weekends, unlike some of us!

have a good one. peace!"

"event","By the time the Lord made woman, he was into his sixth day of working overtime. An angel appeared and said, ""Why are you spending so much time on this one?"" And the Lord answered, ""Have you seen my spec sheet on her? She has to be completely washable, but not plastic, have over 200 movable parts, all replaceable and able to run on diet coke and leftovers, have a lap that can hold four children at one time, have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken heart -and she will do everything with only two hands.""  The angel was astounded at the requirements. ""Only two hands!? No way! And that's just on the standard model? That's too much work for one day. Wait until tomorrow to finish."" But I won't,"" the Lord protested. ""I am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart. She already heals herself when she is sick AND can work 18 hour days."" The angel moved closer and touched the woman. ""But you have made her so soft, Lord."" ""She is soft,"" the Lord agreed, ""but I have also made her tough. You have no idea what she can endure or accomplish."" ""Will she be able to think?"", asked the angel. 

The Lord replied, ""Not only will she be able to think, she will be able to reason and negotiate."" The angel then noticed something, and reaching out, touched the woman's cheek. ""Oops, it looks like you have a leak in this model. I told you that you were trying to put too much into this one."" ""That's not a leak,"" the Lord corrected, ""that's a tear!"" ""What's the tear for?"" the angel asked. The Lord said, ""The tear is her way of expressing her joy, her sorrow, her pain, her disappointment, her love, her loneliness, her grief and her pride."" The angel was impressed. ""You are a genius, Lord. You thought of everything! Woman is truly amazing."" And she is! 

Women have strengths that amaze men. They bear hardships and they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy. They smile when they want to scream. They sing when they want to cry.They cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. They fight for what they believe in. They stand up to injustice.They don't take ""no"" for an answer when they believe there is a better solution. They go without so their family can have. They go to the doctor with a frightened friend.They love unconditionally. They cry when their children excel and cheer when their friends get awards.They are happy When they hear about a birth or a wedding. Their hearts break when a friend dies.They grieve at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left.They know that a hug and a kiss can heal a broken heart. Women come in all shapes, sizes and colors. They'll drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you. The heart of a woman is what makes the world keep turning. They bring joy, hope and love.They have compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends. Women have vital things to say and everything to give. 

HOWEVER, IF THERE IS ONE FLAW IN WOMEN, IT IS THAT THEY FORGET THEIR WORTH."

<P>I went to erica's house and the studious people that we are we did <EM>economics </EM>for a while cause its stupid and dumb and i hate it so we got part of that out of the way. And then we got bored and went to <FONT color=#009900>Sawgrass</FONT> to shop for <FONT color=#990000>skateboards </FONT>(cause we are cool like that)So we look everywhere and eventually got these really cool looking boards from: you'll never find out for a reasonable price. After we bought then we skated all the way back to my car which was on the other side of the <FONT color=#000099>planet. </FONT>And as we were doing it this freak couple was like walking near us and was taking <FONT color=#999900>pictures.</FONT> <STRONG>LOL it was insaine and crazy</STRONG> and that kinda pissed us off cause we were like falling all over the place and i was dressed like a crazy person! and then we get back to my <FONT color=#000099>car </FONT>and decide that we are hungry and to make it a full skateboarder experience we have to go to wendy's and who do we run into at wendy's but them tru skateboarders (well not really) themselves. <FONT color=#3366ff>chasen and stoney</FONT>. and they are gay so thats as far as they go in my story. So then the people at wendy's are obviously inconpetent and took forever! and then we ate in the <FONT color=#ffff00>parking lot </FONT>and then went to michael's to get <FONT color=#ff99ff>paint pens</FONT> to decorate out hott new boards. and then we went and saw <FONT color=#999999>alex</FONT> cause i had blown him off a few too many times the past few times that he had been down and i was feeling rather guilty and erica went with me cause i lover her so much! and on our way there we saw these kids at a<FONT color=#ff6600> bus stop </FONT>on the <FONT color=#ff6600>other side of the road</FONT> and as i am changing lanes erica goes <STRONG>""wait wait wait""</STRONG> so i <EM>slam</EM> on my breaks thinking who knows what! and then i do a U turn so we can drive past those kids. and then we drive past them and slow down to like <STRONG>10 mph</STRONG> and they just stare at us as we drive right past them. it was hilarious cause even as we drove past them they watched us thinking we are insane! and then we kinda got lost on our way to alex's and called this guy on the gate phone. <EM>whoopsies</EM> and had a full conversation with <FONT color=#cc33cc>our new friend tony.</FONT> and well, then we just left tony hangin and drove away lol. <FONT color=#990000>sorry tony!</FONT> and then we went into the wrong neighborhood again! and drove out and finally we got into the right neighborhood but didnt want to deal with the gate so <FONT color=#009900>we just followed the pizza guy in.</FONT> LOL and then we talked to alex and then went back to erica where we decorated our hott new boards and just basically hung out. <FONT size=4>it was a blast!! </FONT></P>

As for life updates... 3 games this week
Northeast- Away- today at 730
Deerfield (aka BFE)- wednesday- Away- 730
Friday- biggest game of the season- Dillard- Home- 730

Art field trip tomorrow.. woohoo

Friday night- we had a game and then i went and dewey taught me how to skate... and it was sooo much fun but now i just have to break the ""head games"" and do it the right way. i am one messed up mofo, when it comes to skating. tehe and then dewey and i chilled for a little
Saturday night- was actually a lot of fun. we went to stephanie's party and we chilled with a bunch of guys from cypress. no further comments. 

I pity...
people who are starved for attention
and people who lack self esteem.

There are so many things that i wish i could say and that could be said but the oppotunity never prevails and that could lead to anyone's demise.  


In order for someone to completely understand my feeling you must know that i grew up never being able to tell anyone anything that went on in my head and i learned to bottle things up very well but i eventually overcame that and i have gotten much better about talking about things but I have a limit and when i reach my limit tend to just go into conclusion but thats when i need to be around people the most.

So i am on the verge of throwing in the towel and if this is good or bad i am not sure but i want to be pulled in one direction or the other.

She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry; once again, he replied with a no. She had heard enough; as she walked away, tears were streaming down her face. 

The boy grabbed her arm and said, ""You're not pretty, you're beautiful. I don't want to be with you forever, I need to be with you forever. And wouldn't cry if you walked away, I'd die.""

okay, and i love it when certain songs remind you of certain people and you may not even be listening to the song but all your doing is sitting there thinking about that person that it reminds you of and you get lost in thought and the words and you don't even know what else is going on around you...

<P>Another hard day at school. *sighs* it really sucks knowing we are like the only people that are in school and i just sit there and i think that i could be sleeping right then or being a vegetable or something else.&nbsp; but instead i am stuck in a desk with a classroom full of um, yeah.&nbsp; i dunno. but then i get to 6th hour and its all good cause that class is so much fun! hunter is the bestest!!&nbsp; well, then today i had so much shit to do after school. Cailini- Aerobics and Powder Puff. HELL YES!! a bunch of girls playing football, what is better than that? w00t w00t. and then brittney and i went to our 2 second student council meeting and then we had to go pick up my car from the shop (no guys, it was just a routine oil change) a royal pain in my ass. then came home to work on my Silver Knigh Scholarship shit which almost put me to sleep and i gotta finish up tomorrow. This college crap aint no fun, well okay, emig and i did housing yesterday and that was fun but thats about it. Everything from here on out is just ZZZ classes and shit, man thats stress but i am totally excited to do it all. and i saw rachel today for the first time in a long time, i just happened to run into her, literally, haha. and then i pretty much vegged. i have put all my homework off just cause i dont wanna do it. okay, thats not completely true... i did work on my art project which i cant wait to officially start tomorrow... i am just oozing with inspiration. haha. well, and i wont lie... i've been thinking alot about SOS (different one than before, he got the BOOT bitches!) I guess i just came to my senses you could say, but its okay cause i dont think this is going anywhere because he is utterly too perfect.</P>
<P>But perfection can get weary</P>
<P>Thats what i thought... until i met you </P>
<P>and all i want is to fall asleep in your arms. </P>
<P>*sap alert*!!! anyways, the rest is from an e-mail my mommy sent me and i just thought it was cute... enjoy</P>

"event","wow, i am completely speechless and blown away. I am not going to give out any names to refrain from starting anything.  But i am very impressed with the way that some people uphold themselves. It shows that there are some people that are still good in this world and unfortionately there are others that just arent.  I can't say very much without giving away what i am talking about but you know who you are and i really appreciate your jesture, you didn't have to do it, especially if you didn't do anything which i do believe you didn't. Now a days, it takes me quite a bit to trust people because there are just so many nasty people out there that are only looking out for #1. and me being the type of person i am (i guess you would have to know me pretty well to understand this) i always want to help people and i am kinda naive at times, which is my own fault, but i have learned to be a little more careful before trusting anyone and sure this may not always be the best for relationships with people but it keeps me from getting hurt.  and if thats what it takes, i am willing to take the risk.  and also, to this person, i am glad that you now understand the seriousness (is that a word?) of the situation and you can somewhat sympathize with me (not that i am looking for sympathy... but thats reality) and i must say that i am slowly getting over everything because there is no reason to hold a grudge, whats done is done and you nor i nor anyone else can change that.  I cant say that i forgive everyone involved maybe i am just not ready to or maybe I am not that big of a person but either way, you gotta take it one day at a time. and right now thats what i am doing... and when i hit my little bump in the road it made things a little easier. so, thanks again."

<P>well, christmas break has been a good soul searching time. My va-ca to missouri turned out to be really good for me. it was either going to kill me or help and despite the frustration my cousins cause me it was really good. i have spent a lot of time thinking about everything that has gone on lately and i realize that there is nothing to really think about. like, i have nothing to be thinking about and i dont really know. </P>
<P>some of the things i have figured out ... My personality i like to make things very black and white. there is no grey to me. i am not the kind of person that likes to talk about how i feel or liking someone. to me, that shows a sign of weekness. but when i finally want to tell someone,&nbsp;i get it in my mind that if i dont tell them like right then the world is going to crumble or something. maybe i am making no sense at all. but its okay. </P>
<P>...to be continued. sleep deprivation.</P>"

and i dont understand why i do them. 

I wish life was more simple than that.

Maybe i have too much?

... and yet i don't have what i want?

kinda like that stupid britney spear's song called lucky that says, ""and i cry, cry, cry, in my lonely heart thinkin, if theres nothen missin in my life, then why do these tears come at night...""

lots of things throughout the day make me look at who i am and decide whether or not i am proud of that, and in many aspects i am, but in others... you get the idea

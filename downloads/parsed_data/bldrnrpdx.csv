"event","We did a food swap at Portland Homestead Supply Co. We traded my Deep Spice Berry Jam and Ginger Pickled Blueberries for all kinds of things. White grape juice, cranberry jun, barbecue sauce, manchego (with saffron threads in it), persimmon chutney, fermented applesauce, polish cucumber pickles, creole sun-dried tomato sauce, and a Long Island Cheddar squash. Oh, and some awesome fluffy white bread made and traded by a middle-school girl (and her little sister and mom). And we didn't even get everything that was offered - someone brought eggs, big fat leeks, there were a few other giant squashes, several other kinds of pickles, some homemade pasta, and I can't even remember all the rest of it.

I dispatched the pumpkin a few days later. I made pumpkin puree, small chunks of cooked pumpkin, pumpkin pickles, toasted seeds, and saved a small batch of seeds for growing more. Some of the pureed squish will go in next week's oatmeal for sure. It's an amazingly vivid orange. I should try pumpkin smoothies too. I haven't done that in forever. 

I also recently hooked up with the Portland Preservation Society, who does some swaps. It's too bad their meetings are on weeknights, but I'll see what I can do."

"event","Early this morning:  noticing my anxiety levels are almost back to normal. I've had a couple of nights of rough sleep, but it's less to do with stress and anxiety and more to do with just how sleep goes for me anymore. Awesome!
This is highly relevant because I had, best as I can figure it, at least 4 panic attacks in a single week. I had one of my rare days when I got to work and realized I shouldn't be there days in there as well. I haven't had that many panic attacks that close together since I was in the middle of separating/divorcing, still processing the emotionally abusive crap from the other partner, finishing grad school & thesis, and trying to figure out how to dig myself out of debt. 

This morning at work:  I popped my head into one of my classes to see who's there - it lets me do my attendance, my multiple contact logs, and helps me plan my ""attack"" across the three mornings classes at this school. One of my small friends spots me. 
     ""Teacher Wendy! Are you coming back?""
     I assured her I was coming back.
     ""At play time?""
     Yes, I'll come back at play time.
     ""To play with me and (other friend in same class I work with)?""
     Yes, to play with you and (other friend). 
     ""Okay!""  And with a big smile, she seemed satisfied and turned back to her breakfast. I do like my job. 

After work, I took myself out to dinner at a Lebanese place near work. It was early enough that it was just me and one other patron who'd just ordered as I arrived. I was looking through the menu when he asked if he could interrupt me, and asked if I was at all familiar with Mediterranean food or the Mediterranean restaurants in the area. Oh, honey. You don't even know what you're getting into here. We ended up spending our whole dinner time talking about various forms of Mediterranean food, whether it was the same as Middle Eastern food, about the restaurants in the area, which was ""better"" and why, what foods I'd suggest he tries, and so on and so forth. Turns out he's from Saipan by way of Vancouver, WA, and was stunned when I'd said I'd heard of it. Then the server came by with a box for my leftovers and as I told him how much I liked their mjedra, he said ""it's all because of this guy right here"" and introduced me to the owner, who I made promise to tell his wife thank you for cooking it and using her family recipe. Which led to a conversation with him where we discovered we both moved to the US about the same time, and he's from a town just outside Beirut and no I hadn't made it to Lebanon but we'd meant to and it just didn't happen before moving to the US. 

Last stop before going home, New Seasons to acquire treats for the mandatory frivolities at tomorrow's staff meeting/potluck. Managed to get something appropriate for the event: food I know at least I'll eat, food that is easily recognizable without signage or explanation (as opposed to, say, a casserole), food that doesn't require heating or freezing, food that doesn't require fussy preparation tonight or at the staff meeting, food that is easy to serve, and food that I won't mind taking home if there's leftovers. Get all done, go to the bus stop just outside, and what do I hear? 
""Tamales! Hot tamales!""
I'm under strict orders from Michael that if I ever hear that call and I have the wherewithal to do so at that time, to ""BUY ALL THE THINGS!""  
I see the sign on his cart that says ""chicken  beef  cheese  cactus"". I assume these are separate and distinct tamales. I also see on the sign that the tamales are ""$6for5"".  I intended to get two of each kind. I catch ""no, they..."" and missed everything else that followed. I do get that I can get two of something for $10. I figure, what the hell, give him $10, and he gives me two plastic bags with foil inside. They're hot, they smell good, I trust him. Michael will love me even more when I get these home. 

I get home and find a present for me! 
Our wedding anniversary, celebrated a little early, was marked by an official American flag flown over the Oregon state capitol building, just for us. And we get to keep the flag! Thank you, Congressman Earl Blumenauer!"

"event","Last night's dream:

I'm in the second floor of a large building downtown with at least three full-sized glass walls, ceiling to floor. I'm pretty sure it was the student union building at a university, and I have the feeling I was going to school in my dream. 

I need to get to the first floor so I can catch my bus home. Why? Because there are 100+ foot tsunami waves headed straight for my building, moments away from crashing down on it. Mind you, it's all blue skies and sunny on the other side of the building. 

I decide it would take too long to get to the stairs or elevator on the other side of the building, so I take the really steep, really scary polished granite slide that goes from where I'm standing to the door that leads to my bus stop. 

But instead of landing on the first floor by the main entrance, I end up in the third floor instead, and now the waves are even closer. 

Then I woke up."

"event","I had a perfect bowl of soup today. 

Not *the* perfect bowl, *a* perfect bowl. 

A perfect bowl of soup doesn't mean this is the only soup I'm ever going to make from now on, and I think everyone should make this soup too. There's lots of perfectly wonderful soups out there. But to be a perfect bowl of soup, it should (a) taste perfectly wonderful, (b) not just taste good, but be perfectly satisfying, and (c) create a perfect moment. 

I made a beef and bean soup today, with a soup bone from the half-a-cow we bought last year. Over the last several months, I've been making more of an effort to use more and different kinds of beans and grains in more ways in my cooking. A very easy step towards this is more bean soups. I had an open jar of dry beans, and I had the second very meaty soupbone of an open package that needed to be used up, so beef and bean soup it was! 

This is not the perfect bowl. 

I browned the meat on the bone, then tossed in a bunch of fried fresh onion, some rosemary and thyme from the garden, some of the vegetable soup starter I made recently, a swig of soy sauce, a bit of minced garlic, a cup of dried beans, and about 6 cups of water, and let it all sit in the dutch oven on low for about six hours. When I went to check on it, the beans were perfect (still firm but melted in my mouth) and the meat was finally falling off the bone. I added a swig of balsamic vinegar, some black pepper and some salt. It was pretty frickin' amazing. It might make for a perfect bowl of soup tomorrow night. 

But it wasn't a perfect bowl for tonight. 

There was a ton of liquid compared to the solids in the pot. My original plan had been to ladle a bunch of it off and reduce it in a second pot. Then I got the urge to make noodle soup. My plan is to put some pearl couscous in the bean soup later. But I wanted soba noodles for dinner. Soba noodle soup. Now. I've been coming across a lot of ramen variations recently, some of which have soft-boiled egg. That sounded pretty good. 

So I soft-boiled two eggs. While they cooled, I used the water to cook some soba noodles. Then I ladled some of the beef-&-bean broth over the noodles, heated it back up, added a bit of rice wine vinegar, some dried shallots, a bit of sesame oil, and put the two whole soft-cooked eggs back in, and let it all simmer a couple of minutes. I portioned it out into two bowls, one for me and one for Michael. When I gave it to him, I was joking about it being ""second soup"", as I'd made a second soup straight off the first soup. I'm not sure I've done that before. Sure, I've made stocks and bases, but not a whole soup and then an offshoot soup. So that was pretty cool too. 

One smallish bowl of noodles, broth and egg. It's only been in the last couple of years that I've gotten to like eggs cooked any other way than hard through. The egg in the soup was just soft enough that when I cut it in the bowl, just a little oozed into the broth. By the time I was about halfway through the soup, the yolk had managed to make the soup a bit thicker. And because it was soft-cooked, the white wasn't all rubbery either. The whole thing tasted amazing, I learned a new technique, it looked pretty when I cut through the egg, when I was done I felt like this bowl was exactly what I needed tonight, and I didn't feel the need for anything else following it. Not even the chocolate we'd bought earlier. Everything about the experience felt good. *That* is a perfect bowl of soup."

"event","It was a lovely, quiet train ride up. Of course, I hadn't really thought about how I was taking my acoustic bass up there, and just tossed it in its soft bag. The baggage handler at Amtrak told me I couldn't check it, and of course, she's right. I got lucky and was able to put it in the overhead space. Once up there, I spent the day with M&M, who took me to breakfast and to three different guitar shops to find a case that would fit both the bass and my budget. In the process, we stumbled across one of M's past students, who had nothing but good things to say about the class and about M's teaching. Apparently he doesn't run into his past students often, much less to also hear good things like this, so that was awesome. M&M also showed me their new house - their first homeownership. It's a fixer-upper for sure, but the two of them have serious skills, and they both know when they've got the skills and when it's time to outsource, and it's actually got room for all his cars and a shop to work on them, plus plenty of crafting and music and garden space for her, which is pretty amazing for them. 

One of the days up there, I did nothing but walk, with bits of shopping. Snacks for later in the evening, a few things from Lush (which resulted in three different sample gifts!), and finding $80 in twenties on the floor inside the mall. Between that cash and M paying me back for the concert ticket, my new hard-side bass case was totally paid for! Also ran across five - yes FIVE - Asterixes at a bookshop, four in Croatian and one in Polish. 

I made the nearly-annual stop at Diva Dolls, and went through the nearly-annual disappointment. None of their dresses or tops work on me, though a couple of the skirts came close. Their stuff is always so close, but no cigar. They've started carrying some fabulous shoes - of course, the price is *almost* out of my reach. Just close enough to taunt me. And since the Tatyana store has now opened and closed in both Seattle and Portland, I'm kind of stuck for the retro-wear that fits non-model sizes. 

The concert was effing amazing. I've seen Brian Setzer before, as the trio (with Lee Rocker making a guest appearance!). This time I got to see the whole orchestra. Christmas music just annoys the hell out of me anymore, but I put up with it, because the BSO only comes out this way maybe every other year, and usually with the BSO Christmas Tour. It was worth it. The opening act, Low Volts, was also pretty good, though not quite as awesome as Cousin Harley, who opened for BS's trio last time. Still, a fabulous evening. 

I also made the nearly-annual stop at Lola's restaurant. So. Much. Yum. Also had coffee with T. Hopefully he'll make it down to Pdx before too long. Never did hear back from J. It might be time to move on, there. 

I didn't get the always-hoped-for bubble bath, but I did get a lovely afternoon & evening lolling about the hotel room. Played bass for a couple of hours, did some crossword puzzles, read a half-dozen chapters in the China Mieville book I'm working on, had some lovely snacks bought earlier at PP Market, had tea and even splurged on a mini-bar drink, and generally enjoyed the hell out of having the hotel room to myself. 

I do like my winter get-away."

"event","Work has been crazy again - got a bunch of new sites. Then I had to change them around due to a co-worker going on medical leave. I recently got another new site. And one of my team members is leaving my team (for good things on her part), and we don't have a new hire to replace her so I don't know how to organize some of my kids and sites that need her position either serving the kids directly or consulting with the classroom staff or both. I am thrilled to bits, though, that my regional team's offices have moved both closer to my sites and closer to decent transportation for me, so I can actually get out there and back without spending half a day doing so. 

Let's see... it's been since at least Thanksgiving or so. What's happened in that time?

I had the Allergy Rash of Mystery - on my chest, my face, the backs of my hands, and tops of my feet (but only small patches on my hands and feet).  Two trips to the doctor came up with ""we dunno. that's how it goes sometimes. we'll treat it anyway.""  Okay. 

I also had the Muscle Spams from Hell in my neck right before Thanksgiving week. It's not as bad these days, but it hasn't left completely. 

I think this is the best I've done during Thanksgiving week since my mom died. On the other hand, Allergy Rash of Mystery and Muscle Spasms from Hell plus a cold. Potayto, Potahto, I guess.

Thanksgiving itself went okay mostly. M and I were both too sick to go to my Dad's for dinner (several days before the actual holiday date), but were fine for the dinner we threw at our house. Two of our guests were sick, though, so we had an enormous dinner for just 4.5 of us. 

Close to Christmas, I felt weirdly festive and decided to make cookies. And realized our friends K&J were coming over with their 9 y/o, Miss I. Miss I and I can make cookies! We made stained glass cookies. I haven't hardly thought about them since I was a kid. Turned out Michael hadn't really heard of them, K&J hadn't heard of them, so we had to start asking around. I asked through almost everyone I saw at work over a week, M asked everyone he saw at work and poker, and we came up with a total of 3 who'd ever heard of them, and only 2 of those had either made or eaten them. Woo! Style points for me, Way to bring a traditional cookie back!  So I made another batch for our dental office across the street (they hadn't heard of them either), and two more batches to take to my dad's for Christmas for the various households. 
 
There's been more kitten petting lately. We're figuring out better ways to go about it, and they're slowly becoming more tolerant of it.  I've also gotten to be in cat piles a couple of times, anywhere from a few minutes to an hour, with one big cat and one little cat. One of these days...

The kittens and Tucker got to go out in the catio to experience storms and snow.

Managed to get some of the to-do list done: made a pasta sauce for later this week, made oatmeal for breakfasts, made up my lunches for the week, did some housework, will probably not get to using the goat's milk I bought last week to make cheese (feel bad about not making cheese? check! feel guilty I'm wasting the milk? check! feel guilty I'm wasting the *expensive* milk? check!), and am working on what to make with all the leftover mushrooms.

Finally had it up to >here< with the fucked-up assignments & syllabus for class and left a rant on this week's class discussion list. Also finished up a rough draft for the department Dean. Will get Michael to read it when he has a chance, before sending it off.

And because there's never really any separating of panic attacks and depression, I'm also feeling bad about not getting done a dozen or so other projects I'd ""meant to do"" and never quite got around to doing with my week off. And of course I'm doing none of them right now either. Because my hands are shaky, my heart is fluttery, my brain is seizing up, and I'm going to hide on one of my computer games for a bit.

"event","Cooking is finally done for the day.

- toasted almonds, for a variety of applications through the week (especially chopped up for cold or hot cereal)
- toasted chestnuts, because a couple of years ago, I discovered I love plain, cooked chestnuts when the season rolls around
- lentils with carrot & chicken/apple sausage (with 5-spice, fenugreek, celery seed, mushroom powder, and garam masala)
- raspberry oat bars, that came out less bar and more cobbler, and amazing all the same
- mini dutch babies, done in muffin pans
- mini corn dog muffins
- breakfast casserole, with chicken/apple sausage, muenster & parmesan, and sourdough wheat bread

Lessons learned:

- simmering, baking, then letting the chestnuts sit in a bowl, hot, covered up to steam for a while, works for peeling them far better than either just simmering or just baking has for me so far. Still, I'm open to better, easier methods.
- a bit of hibiscus vinegar & ginger liqueur in the raspberry mixture is pretty darned amazing
- dutch babies, mini or not, are probably better when had when warm, and not made ahead to be reheated later (but you know I'm taking them for work lunch along with the berry syrup all the same)
- make sure I grease the muffin pan REALLY WELL when making the dutch babies. They are far more attractive when they fall out of the pan instead of being ripped out, shredding the entire way

and, oh crap, I just realized I forgot to make oatmeal for week-day breakfasts. Guess I'm going back to the kitchen in a bit."

-Putting the oldest cat down.
-Oral surgery.
-The relentless heat, frequently accompanied by humidity. 
-Couldn't ride my bike because of the heat (and got tired of the sunburns), didn't do many bussing or walking adventures because of it either.
-The stress of moving out of my office, not knowing where I was moving to for the longest time, not being able to move in to the new, finally decided-upon, spot till school starts. Having to move everything home in the meantime. Deciding what to keep and what to pass on.
-The usual depression that settles in during my longer breaks, exacerbated by the heat keeping me from getting stuff done.
-The yard work sliding so bad, from aforementioned heat and depression. Watching certain plants die, certain yard foods go to waste, the bird baths go dry. I had several projects, none of them terribly difficult, I'd wanted to get done this summer, but the help I'd counted on from a friend and his truck fell through, so even if it hadn't been for the heat, I still wouldn't have gotten a lot of things done.
-Getting a ton of new work sites. Not sure yet how I'm scheduling or transporting between them all yet. I haven't met many of the teachers or site directors yet either. I'm a little anxious about that. Plus I get new co-worker team members for several of these new-to-me sites.
-Michael's new job - it's awesome, it's just made for a number of changes to our routines. 
-Adopting two kittens - littermates who treat each other like brothers, with all the snuggling and romping and tackling. Watching the two older cats figure out their reaction to the kitten boys (one is not amused at all at the interlopers, the other has been teaching them how to play and hunt, but gets tired out easily and can only take so much at a time)
-Sorting out finances as several things in the household need to be addressed at pretty much the same time. It's all going be fine, they just weren't all on the schedule or had to get moved up on the schedule. Feh. 
-Watching more than a few friends have more than a little crap and chaos in their lives at the moment. 

It'll just take a few weeks to get his work schedule sorted out, it'll take at least that long to get my own sorted out but it will happen, we're slowly acclimating the feline household members to each other, the heat will eventually pass (right?), I don't know what to do about the yard at this point but something will eventually happen, the stuff around the house requiring money be thrown at it will get sorted in due time, and there isn't much I can do for my friends and their crap/chaos except be available as I can.

"event","Over the last month, I've been approaching ""normal"" sleep again. After about three years of completely messed-up cycles and far too little sleep. How do I know?  I've started dreaming again. I don't remember all about every dream, but I remember enough to know I've had at least one dream most nights in the past 3-4 weeks. They haven't all been loss-of-power dreams either (kinda blows the theory now, eh Michael?)

-Coral and Ryan and Michael and I were on a tour somewhere. I vaguely remember being outdoors with them as Ryan was explaining the history of the area

-I was in an outdoor market, looking for stationery. I talked with a couple of vendors and shoppers before Nicolle's mom helped me find what I was looking for

-Christopher Lee was my play partner. I was in my mid/late 20s, he was in his late 40s/early 50s. I don't remember what we were doing - talking, I think, possibly more but in a casual kind of way. It was a good relationship too, based on how I felt at that moment. 

-I was talking on the phone with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. While I don't remember now who it was, I am sure I knew who it was while I was in the dream. We made arrangements to get together. (it might have been Holly or MS)

-I was exploring a 200-300 sqft house about 3/4 built and trying to help solve some storage and aesthetic challenges.  I watch Tiny House Nation occasionally and miss my Little House, so it's not hard to see where I'd come up with this one.


Even weirder, I've been getting up before 10am, even 8am almost every day on my three-week vacation. I typically slide into Night Owl mode in the first three days of my breaks, regardless of season or weather or goings-on. I don't know what's different this time. On top of this, I watch M with his CPAP, and I wonder how much *more* different it would be if I could get my allergies under better control or had a CPAP of my own."

"event","We're down to two cats in the household. Which is already weird, given that we collectively had five when I moved in. One of the cats is at the vet clinic all day, for dental surgery, so there's only one cat in the house. And it's hot today, so he's been napping in my MIL's bedroom all day. It's like there are NO CATS in the house. It's just weird and wrong.

ETA: Black Kitty is home and doing well. They ended up having to take not just one, but two teeth out, including one of his magnificent fangs. Everyone in the house is saddened by this. And worse, his periodontal disease is such that he will likely lose more teeth over the coming years. 

In the meantime, he and I are back to full-contact snuggling."

"event","I had an outstanding compliment recently. When we were at our local Farmers Market not too long ago, one of the vendors we kinda know from our neighborhood food swap stopped us and asked if I had anymore of the ketchup I'd brought to the swap. Over a year ago. She really liked it and wanted to know if I had any left to trade with. We talked for quite a while about the products she and her husband make for their business, along with some of the things they make but don't/can't sell at the Farmers Market. I gave her my card with my home email address on it and she said she'd get hold of me. 

Two weeks went by and I figured either she was just being nice or engaging in conversation to draw us into the booth (not in a completely disingenuous way, but being a good salesperson). Either way was cool with me, and she either didn't really want the ketchup in the first place or had forgotten. No big deal. She makes a ton of jams, shrubs, breads, and she and her husband have a meal prep/meal delivery service in town, so I know she knows how to cook! 

I just got a note from her today saying she really is interested, is happy to take all I've got left, and offered up some of her not-for-sale products she and her husband have been working on. I offered a jar each of additional items, and she jumped on that as well!  Her parting note was ""This seems like the first of many good trades to come!""  She makes a ton of jams, shrubs, breads, and she and her husband have a meal prep/meal delivery service in town, so I know she knows how to cook! I know I know how to cook too, but this is quite a compliment!

"event","Today was full of performance art. 

We went to the Rock & Roll Camp for Girls showcase, as the daughter of friends of ours, E, attended for the first time. She's been waiting pretty much her whole life to go to this camp - a couple of family friends have been to Ladies Rock Camp, and I'm pretty sure some of her older friends have been to the Girls camp as well. This year she was finally old enough to go. We were impressed by a lot of the performers, from the biggest to the smallest. There's a stanza in one of the songs that I think I need to print out and post on my wall as a reminder. The whole show was pretty fabulous. 

Before and after that show, we hit a number of garage sales. There's a bit of performance art in good Garage Sale selling. Very few of the garage sales we went to today demonstrated it. Sigh, alas.

Tonight was our last opera for a while. It's the last of the season, and we've decided not to renew our subscription, so we were really looking forward to it. It was nice to end on a romantic comedy - no one died or even got physically hurt in this one. That may nearly have been a first for us. 

After the opera, we decided to get late-night treats: tea, coffee, and goat-cheese panna cotta at The Heathman. Part way through, a trio of lounge musicians started. Surprise performance art! (well, a surprise to us, anyway)  They were good - though several Saturday Night Live skits came to mind, and I kept waiting for ""Clang! clang! clang! went the trolley!"" All in all, a lovely way to end the evening. 

Tomorrow's scheduled performance art is a group outing to see the movie Ant-Man, with the requisite picnic afterwards. There may even be some music-making at home. I might have to do a dramatic reading to the cats too now, just because.

And all of this with my favorite date, too!

ETA: Day Two of the Performance Art Weekend

We saw Ant-Man with the group, and while there was no picnic afterwards as such, there was a group lunch. Wherein there was much discussion of Cosplay. No actual cosplaying itself, but much much talk about it, as several of the lunch-goers are going to a Con in a couple of weeks and have both group and individual costumes they're doing. And with this group, even having lunch together is a kind of performance art. 

No music-making today either. Unless fiddling with lyrics counts. I stayed up late on the computer last night and played around with a couple of songs in various states of composition. Found myself doing a little more of the same in my head when I woke up today too. 

Perhaps there shall be bedtime stories tonight. And maybe music tomorrow."

"event","I happened to see the sign for this museum as I was doing errands by city bus, and accidentally caught the bus going the wrong direction. I looked them up online and it sounded just interesting enough to check out. Michael and I took the ""Quick Tour"" (there is both a Quick Tour and a Regular Tour, both involving handouts for self-guided tours). The canoes and kayaks are displayed in two ""alleyways"" in the building, and several other, smaller, models of ships and watercraft can be found throughout the room on windowsills, the front desk, and hanging from the ceiling. I am kicking myself, however, for not getting pictures of the ""Kayak and Canoe Museum of Kitsch"" in the bathroom, where several posters and bits of cheesy ship-related artwork festoon the walls. The whole place is pretty awesome. Even more awesome when you consider admission is free. 

It's a rather small museum, but very well done. And admission is free! We also had a lovely chat with the staff. A rather fantastic date night!


From their website, <a href=""http://www.traditionalkayaks.com/museum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">www.traditionalkayaks.com/museum.html</a>:  ""The bulk of the LSKCM's watercraft collection is made of full-sized functional replicas of traditional Arctic hunting kayaks. Harvey Golden built these replicas in order to compliment his museum studies with an element of experimental research. These vessels are the largest and most complete assembly of pan-arctic kayak forms in the world."""

"event","I'm still on soft and liquid foods, which has been seriously frustrating, as a fan of varied textures in my meals. I'm bored of scrambled eggs and canned chicken soup (easy to make while I was still fighting with a lot of pain). Today I did mashed potatoes with some cheddar, yogurt and Penzey's Roasted Garlic, and Cinnamon Rice Pudding in the crockpot (with instead of 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, more like 1 1/2 tablespoons, and with Lactaid instead of ""real"" milk, because that's what we had in the house). I also baked a giant sweet potato. So, still boring textures, but at least the food is a bit more interesting.

In the meantime, I finally figured out I don't actually have a bandage on the roof of my mouth, but I do have two sutures, one of which is nearly ready to fall out. I also have sutures on my grafts, where before they've used a form of superglue. 

I'm starting to brush my teeth again - only parts, though, where there's no sutures or grafts. The little bit of brushing I'm able to do has already helped my mouth feel less gross and has helped reduce the pain a bit. I still won't be doing any real chewing or managing of firm or mixed textures for several more days, and I still have to be supercareful how strenuous of activity I do (including even leaning over) because when my blood pressure goes up, my mouth hurts worse."

"event","I got through cleaning out the cat box supplies okayish. Moving around the tarp on my bed was much harder. It's been off about 48 hours or so, which is the longest the tarp's been off my bed in close to three years. I've heard her voice in the house a couple of times. I'm not sure if the boys have figured out she's really gone. They *have* figured out her special cat box is gone, and they're not amused, as they vastly prefer it to the two other boxes in the house.  We still have to be on poop-&-puddle patrol, as the one cat doesn't get to come and go as he pleases, and expresses his discontent in the most obvious of ways."

"event","Yesterday was oral surgery. They almost had to scratch it because my blood pressure reading was so high. As in, high enough I can't imagine I would still be standing and coherent if it was a true reading. The second attempt gave an even higher reading. Didn't seem to occur to anyone but me that maybe their machine was not working properly. Seriously? 200-and-something? They decided to go ahead anyway. Of course, they had to keep re-administering locals all over my mouth. I don't remember ever having that problem before either. But they managed to get everything done. Some serious meds and a sleeping pill once I got home meant I slept about 24 hours straight. 

Today is managing the pain so it stays at a dull roar. There's also no toothbrushing, no actual facewashing (a light pat with a washcloth is about it), no leaning way over for anything, no eating anything thicker than super-thin smoothies, and talking only carefully. I had said super-thin smoothie with a thinned-down hot cereal (not oatmeal, but similar) and discovered it worked best to rinse with plain water every bit or sip or two, along with a lot of gentle swishing after the food was done. No straws, no chewing, no thick food or food with any texture for a bit, be *super* careful when sneezing, and don't let the cats head-butt me anywhere but the back or top of my head. 

I'm trying very hard to leave the bandage on the roof of my mouth alone because it will suck *hard* when it comes off."

"event","Today was Callie's last trip to the vet. I got her all bundled up in her carrier, then had to set it down so I could get my wallet and keys and a couple of other things sorted out. The whole time the carrier was on the floor, Tucker laid next to it, facing the mesh opening so he could see her. 

It was hard enough a decision to make. It was also her first city bus ride. No seats, so I put her carrier on the floor next to me, towards the back of the bus, and she kinda freaked out about all the smells and sounds and bumping around. Then we got there early, which wasn't too bad, except the nice ladies at the desk asked me all the same questions I'd already answered on the phone, mostly about the cremation and the little memorial plaque they do, only this time I went through a handful of tissue while trying to answer them. Then they put me and Callie in an exam room. I knew it was a busy day for the clinic, but after 15 minutes of waiting, I finally asked the nice ladies if perhaps something had come up, was it going to be a while longer, not that I was trying to rush anyone or be rude. They went to check. A few minutes later one of the nice ladies said the tech would be with me in a few minutes. Then the tech came in and asked me the same questions I'd already answered over the phone and at the front desk about the cremation and little memorial plaque. She said the doctor would come in a few minutes. Then he came in and asked me more questions, questions he's supposed to ask, but I was about ready to tell him to stuff it. Then he gave me the You're Doing The Right Thing, And Yes It Sucks pep talk, which I also almost told him to stuff. He's a good guy and a good doctor. I just didn't need the pep talk. I make a point of saying thank you to him, because over the last few years he's gone out of his way to help us solve the pooping-on-the-bed situation, figure out what was making her lose all the weight, manage her various issues, and all that good stuff. Then he gave Callie the sedative. He said it would take 5-10 minutes to take effect - he'd come back in a bit. As soon as he left the room, she tried to hop off the exam table, as the sedative hit. So I'm trying to keep her from oozing off the table. Then about 1.5-2 minutes into the sedative taking effect, she starts heaving. Giant heaves. And barfs. All over the fleece blanket they've set up for her, and because she's now so sedated, it's all over the side of her face. I manage to rearrange her so she's (1) not oozing off the exam table, (2) not laying with her face full on deep in her own barf, and (3) trying to get her claws unstuck from the blanket, all the while (4) not moving the blanket [which is sliding around on the exam table as I'm rearranging her] such that the barf then ends up on me. 
The doctor came back in shortly after all of this and helped me rearrange Callie and the blanket. He gives me another, shorter, pep talk. He also asks me one of the questions that the nice ladies have already asked me three times now, because apparently they kept forgetting to ask some part of it or I didn't give an adequate response.  Another tech comes in this time, so they can do the final injection. This goes very quickly. He gives me a last You Did The Right Thing pep talk and a hug. I'm feeling very spike and don't want the hug, but it's too hard to explain in a way that doesn't come off as very rude, and I don't want to be rude to him because he's doing All The Right Doctor Things and I know that I have Odd Emotional Responses to a lot of stuff, so I suck it up. He invites me to stay as long as I want. I don't want to stay. Whatever else I need to do, I don't want to do it here.  The whole trip ended up being not quite as dignified as I'd hoped. 

I'm really especially not looking forward to all the ""You must be feeling..."" and ""I'm so sorry, let me insert long sad story here."" OMG I love Michael for letting me have my own emotional responses without making me feel like I'm Doing It Wrong."

"event","I found the jacket I wanted for the David Bowie bike ride later this month!  I still need to make two props and find a pair of full-length jeans, so I can do the three-inch cuff (I only have short-legged jeans that fit perfectly) and I'll be ready.

Today was the Grease Sing-Along bike ride for Pedalpalooza 2015. About 25-30 people were part of the ride at any given point. Tom, the leader, had done a bunch of research ahead of time and all the stops we made had tie-in trivia for the songs or other points in the movie. He not only brought an audio system, but had the DVD playing each song with captioning. How awesome is that? I've been on rides with audio blasting - this is my first with video as well. Rather than make an entire post just for the ride, I'll leave all the photos on the other side of <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/gp/bladerunnerpdx/e7856q"">this link</a>.

I came home from the ride to find Michael watering the garden. The raspberries are still ramping up, but the blueberries are having a total party. The kohlrabi is just about ready for slaughter, the squash and beans are all finally starting to take off, the tomatoes are nearly too big to cage, and the bees were totally swarming the borage. I was so excited to find one of my dahlias come back from last year! The second surviving snapdragon from last year is blooming like mad right now too, as the delphinium are just heading on their way back out.  I'm so happy Ben is going to keep an eye on the garden for us, and even happier that he and his husband will get to use some of the food & herbs for their own cooking in return for minding the garden. 

Then off to dinner at Marrakesh. Dinner was good but the best part was watching the 6 or 7 y/o girl totally entranced with the belly dancer. She held out her dollar from her mom to tip the dancer and had to get coached on putting it in the dancer's waistband. As soon as she did, she stood up to give the dancer a giant hug, drawing ""Aw!""s from all around the room. Later on the dancer gave the girl a few lessons. You could just see any last thoughts of becoming a ballet dancer fading away - belly dancers get to wear super-sparkly costumes all the time and ballet dancers rarely do, belly dancers get to dance barefoot instead of in pointe shoes, belly dancers get to make noise with their mouths and their finger cymbals and ballet dancers are typically silent, belly dancers get to smile a lot, and people hand you money when you belly dance. How much more awesome does it get? 

And because that wasn't enough to fill the day, we went to the Bourbon & Bacon Fest at OMSI. Along with the dozen or so bourbons Michael tasted, we also sampled chocolate peanut butter bacon cupcakes, bacon brittle ice cream, bourbon BBQ pulled pork, ham bits brushed with bitters and dipped in powdered honey, and bacon truffles. I think we ingested about a bazillion calories. The BBQ sauce over the pulled pork was disappointing, but everything else we tried was amazing. And we barely made a dent in the tasting tables.  On top of this, we ran into most of Michael's buddies from poker that I know. So we got to do a bunch of visiting as well as bourbon swilling and bacon stuffing. 

Now it's time to sort out all the cat poop (no surprises there), make notes on what I need to do tomorrow, and get some rest before finishing up the packing, going to Portland Opera, and seeing Krissy and her girls tomorrow. 

Holy crap, it's a busy weekend!"

It won't be the shower I would like to have thrown, but it'll still be good. I made treats:  a lemon pie, coconut-date balls (with some of the date paste I got from a neighbor a while back), and gluten-free/dairy-free cupcakes, which turned out rather well, I think. I'd thought my recipe was dairy-free, but was mistaken, so halfway through making it I had to come up with a substitute for milk awfully fast. A quick trip to the mini-mart next door, and voila: International Delight Non-dairy creamer, in French Vanilla! I'd already planned to use the cherry flavoring I'd made with the pits and vodka. Cherry and vanilla? Awesome! 

I finally know where I'm going to be for work this summer. First we were told we had to be out of our current building. So my supervisor found a way for me to go back to my old building, where I was last year, to share my old room with the current SLP and add some more speech clinics there. The day after I told my families, we found out that school is not only not interested in adding more speech clinics, they're booting out the current SLP, and not having our program there anymore. Insert long annoying rant with internal politics and politics-of-preschool/special education here. Upshot: that school *does* want two new Head Start classrooms, which I'll end up serving one day a week. 
In the meantime, I do know where I'm going to be for the summer, and it doesn't entirely suck. No idea where I'll be for fall yet, though. 

Krissy and her girls will be here in a few days!  If I keep on top of my to-do list, I should be able to spend a couple of hours visiting with them on their whirlwind national tour. 

ZOMG, getting ready for the big trip! 
I sent a box full of presents last week, so the stuff would get there about the time we arrived. That way I wouldn't have to carry it all in my luggage. Except I misaddressed the box. The recipients refused it, and it was nearly sent back. Not sure what happened in the middle, but I got a call at 6am my time from a lovely gentleman from the Irish Postal Service saying he wanted to get it straightened out so my box wouldn't be sent back to the US and I'd have to reship (ack!). It should be on its way and in time for our visit! Woo! Thank you, Irish Postal Service!

I finally got around to some sewing and jewelry repairs/upgrades. Now I can wear them instead of vaguely remember it's in a drawer or pile or bag, wondering when I'll get around to doing it. 
Maybe when I get back I can make the reversible wrap skirt I've got stuck in my head. 

Ack! I might be able to do the ""Bowie vs. Prince"" bike ride this year! What do I do for a costume? Given the upcoming trip, and that the bike ride is the day after we get back, I have little to no time for costume shopping or creating. I wonder how easily I could find a blue suit jacket and a thin gold cross necklace for ""David Bowie: Little Drummer Boy, feat. Bing Crosby"" I think I have 3 hours or so free tomorrow for looking, and that's about it."

I've made a couple of skirts from oversized blouses, cutting the body of the blouse off under the armpits, and folding the top over to make a casing for the elastic. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough length in the blouse bodies to fold over the top for a casing, and keep the hem where I wanted it against my legs. So I had to add the daisy/sunflower fabric. I managed to screw up the waistband not once, not twice, but four times before I got it right. Even then, it's still got some wobbles on it. With the way I wear skirts, it'll never be noticeable unless I show it on a hangar, and even then only if I have it turned exactly the right way. 

I'm rather pleased with it, all things considered. Now I'm musing how to make a 4-way reversible skirt without the front-half/back-half different fabric cheat. I've got it mostly figured out except for the closure. 

Anyway, here's the skirt. One side is Heffalumps

Of course, it's never quite that easy. I just came off a 3-day low-grade depression. It's a lot like having a 3-day cold. It's not completely miserable, but I had no energy to do anything or even really enjoy anything. Everything was just so... effortful. 

But I seem to be back. It happened yesterday, so I was able to get some stuff done. The one thing I'm rather proud of is that during the mental slog, I was able to ride it out without wallowing in it. I wasn't a joy to be around but I wasn't miserable to be around either. And I've got today and tomorrow still to go!

I did manage to get a bit of work done in the yard, so I don't still have all of it to do. I also got 3/4 of the way done with a sewing project I want done for the big trip. I might even get a second one done. 

Today is helping friends with the last of their big move. Finishing the started sewing project. Making jam. Some more yard work. Tomorrow is dyeing a shirt, sorting out work lunches and maybe a couple of dinners for home, whatever yard work I don't get done today. It might also be the second sewing project."

After that, it's installing the toys and climbers. We picked up a handful of giant branches from a neighbor. We'll probably get a handful more but not till everything else is sorted out and we can see what goes where. I also need to pot up the new catnip plant and some wheatgrass.

Today we went to Ya Hala with Dad & J for Michael's birthday. Yum! And fortunately all the blue makeup and nail polish came off of Michael fairly easily.

I'd noticed a couple of FB group posts saying people weren't able to make it today, but I hadn't realized NO ONE was going!  So I stuck around and played pinball for a while (yay!) then Michael and I went out to dinner before going home.

I made it almost the whole way through the school year before realizing I hadn't taken my personal days off yet. They don't roll over, and I'm mostly okay for paperwork time at work, so I don't feel bad at all taking them. I'm kinda surprised my supervisor let me take a four-day weekend, though, rather than asking if I could space them out a bit. I suppose she can't really ask that. 

Friday Michael and I spent at the beach helping a buddy of his reside his family's beach house. Me and eight guys for the weekend. Sounds like a fantasy come true, eh?  Ah, if only. I helped out as long as my knees and arms lasted, then went in and read my book. They pretty much talked sports and gay sex the whole time. Heck, I could've stayed in town and gone to The Eagle for that - and then at least it all would've been true!  But they're a good bunch of guys. It's just not my group. I went for the ride with M, to get to know them a little bit better, and that was enough.
Personal wins - Michael recently started using his CPAP and is having FANTASTIC results with it. This trip to the beach was our first time sleeping together in years. And we did it! Okay, I was up several times, but not because of him. This is a potential game-changer for how we travel. It's pretty exciting. 

Saturday we were supposed to get dressed up and go to the Portland Meadows Derby Party. Except I had such crappy sleep the night before (and a couple of nights the previous week as well), and the ride home was hard on me, so I ended up sleeping most of the afternoon. I woke up and grogged around a while, then went back to bed.

Sunday I worked in the yard for a couple of hours. Then it was off to join friends to see the new Avengers movie. Twenty-two of us all sitting together in the theater. Followed by post-Avenger shwarma. As is only right. It ended up being about a 5-hour outing. Back to the house for laundry and cats and suchlike. I even washed all the birdbaths. 

Today was more yardwork. A couple of friends helped me haul & spread a yard of compost over to help level out part of the backyard. I also dug out the futon couch and headboard that have been buried in the garage pretty much since I moved in. The plan is to stain the futon frame and put it inside a catio we're making for the sideyard, and the headboard will become a bench for the back patio. Hopefully I'll get to borrow the tinsnips in the next week or so, so I can take down some of the yucky fence in the back too. 

More plusses:   Michael's got all sorts of ""free on your birthday"" offers for places to eat this month, so we have even more dates! AND The dishwasher is still fixed for real!  And I've still got a five-day weekend coming up this month!"

I managed to pawn off three pounds on Miwa on my way home. When I got home, I reworked all four pounds I still had into 1-oz balls and tossed them in the chest freezer. Michael is already thrilled to pieces with bits of date paste rolled in unsweetened coconut flakes with an almond pressed on top. 

I have two movie dates coming up, with overlapping groups, and I'm looking forward to them more because they are group events. 

I have a dress-up even coming up too! A neighborhood festival is having a classic car cruise-in. I decided it's as good an excuse as any to pull out the retro gear and see if I can get a picture or two with a good-looking car.

I'm hoping to have some friends over this coming weekend, maybe even a little help in the garden. It wouldn't surprise me overly if they cancelled at the last minute. Either way, I'll get some time in the garden. 

Work is gearing up again. Hopefully I can spread it out over the next six weeks so it won't be so bad. I just need to stay mindful of all the deadlines and formats.  The handful of co-workers I have to do deadlines with have the same idea I do - we've already made plans to get at least some of the things done early. I still don't know where my office and main classroom are moving to, and I still need to pick up some tote boxes for packing everything back up. I definitely don't want to be doing meetings and paperwork while packing."

"event","I finally took some photos of the garden for the season. Just in time, too, as the tulips are on their way out. I did manage to get pictures of some of the camas lilies about halfway open. I also got the second shade garden started. I still need to figure out what <s>we're</s> I'm doing with the backyard. We're talking about a moveable catio, leveling out the roughest spots in the backyard, possibly pulling out some of the worst of the fencing, maybe putting in some berry bushes, and trying to figure out what to do with the oxalis and horseradish that have gotten into the ground (along with the morning glory and ivy).

"event","The weekend closed out with a turn. About 5pm my Facebook page blew up with emergency requests for a notary public. Then I see that a friend with a colorful medical history is at the hospital. But wait, that hospital isn't near where she lives. I found out she was ministering to another friend, who is dying. They need the notary public to help sort out paperwork so her partner be able to keep the house. 

Do you know how hard it is to find a notary public on a Sunday afternoon?  Turns out the ones who work for the hospital had gone home for the day. Many others answered their phone with a similar message. I guess my friends found one late last night or early his morning. 

Anyway, we went out to the hospital for an hour or two to visit with the folks in the waiting area and help take care of some of them a bit. 

Everyone is still holding on and waiting, as of me getting into work this morning.

ETA: It's about 12 hours since the above. They've found the notary public. Hopefully everyone was present and able to carry out the paperwork in question. 

The medical staff quit monitoring her vitals as of some time this morning, and are just giving palliative care right now. 

A co-worker asked why I was at work and not the hospital. Because there's nothing I can do but sit there and annoy everyone else.  I would like to be there to take care of the caretakers but there aren't enough errands for me to do, that I could actually complete, to be of any use right now. I can be of more use to them later on.  In the meantime, I can be useful to my kids and their families and my co-workers right now.


Edit #2:  And she's passed."

"event","Had a lovely date last night, including visiting with friends. I looked amazing, his mood was really good till towards the end of the night when it was his bedtime anyway - he lasted pretty late! All in all, a success.

Walked almost 4 miles doing errands today. Picked up a couple of stumps from Mr. Neighbor for the yard, picked up another bird waterer/teacup & saucer at Goodwill, and decided not to get the copy of Android Karenina. Maybe next time. 

Got a band meeting on the calendar I can actually attend!  They want to do a song I'd never heard of before. I found a couple of versions of the bass tabs, including what looks like at least one simplified version, so maybe I can work something up by the time we get together. 

Got all the household jobs done today. Woo! Got thoroughly snuggled by cats this morning, looking forward to more at bedtime. 

Found radish sprouts in the garden!  I really need to take some photos out there."

"event","The saga of the dishwasher continues. I wish M would just get his buddy to fix it - these idiots who've been working on it clearly can't get it taken care of.

I saw <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764651/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"">The Expendables 2</a> last night. Easily the best, most self-referential comedy I've seen in ages. I'm looking forward to seeing #3. 

Spring break is finally over. This is how I was greeted first thing in the morning in my office/clinic room: 
<lj-embed id=""190""/>

Our best guess is termites. The custodian's total response was ""Yep, we get 'em every year. Never know which room they'll show up in, but they always come back."" So, completely predictable, yet entirely unpreventable?  Oh, and he laid down a two-inch wide swath of borax on the floor along the wall. In my room where the kids play and work. This follows the 6 or more offices that experienced a weekend worth of flooding for no reason anyone can determine. The response to that was industrial fans, antibacterial spray for the carpets (so they're full of clean mold, instead of getting replaced - yay, for the one lady to had to leave work early to buy an emergency inhaler for her typically-no-problem asthma) and a lot of vague hand-waving. And a bunch of other stuff but I'll stop now. I have fantasies sometimes about what it would be like to work for an organization that doesn't depend on leftovers from other organizations, that has not *lots* but somewhere close to *enough* in terms of budget and resources, that actually ranks high enough on the food chain for little things like *safety* to matter, never mind how the organization *presents* to its clients.

OTOH, I got paid for playing with shaving cream at work. Three times in two days. 

M's prednisone still isn't taking care of the MG flare. This is the second round of prednisone, right on the heels of the first. He's being so careful about his blood sugar now, after the issues with the first round, and it's still not helping enough. I don't know when he'll get issued the CPAP, but hopefully it's soon and will make any bit of positive difference. I don't know what else he can do. 

Yay for dates this weekend."

"event","Grr. Dishwasher/sink issue apparently isn't fixed after all. 
Today's visit was postponed - not entirely surprised, given the weather situation. We'll see.
The two weeks have been like swimming in increasingly murky, dense waters, and I didn't realize how much so till it was like molasses. Bailed on the band meeting because of it. Last night got better. I'm sure having the entire house to myself was only coincidence. Today feels better too though.
Tickets for the Big Trip purchased! It's feeling realer and realer!
Made another pile of freezer toaster waffles. I might be able to give the waffle iron back now, at least until summer.
Cats are currently being ridiculously adorable. It helps make up for the crazy they put me through, waking me up 2-5 times a night.
Saw our neighborhood flicker at the feeders the other day. Haven't seen anyone in the bird bath yet, but that's probably more to do with the weather. I can't wait to get my little campers back out under the one bird bath. I need to figure out where to put the railroad workers too.
M seems to be having a good couple of days, except for having too many carbs at breakfast yesterday, which sucked for a few hours. 
I'd forgotten how long the healing up takes for a piercing. Glad I got the repiercing done when I did, so it won't take quite so much care on our trip. 
Today will hopefully be some cooking and dyeing (if I can find the t-shirts - couldn't find them anywhere last night!).

ETA:
Dishwasher/sink issue fixed! For real!
Picked up the last items to make dinner for tomorrow and lunches/dinner for a couple of work days. Michael also found low-carb bread mix at BRM yesterday and made a loaf today. He said it tasted pretty good - now to see what effect his has on his blood sugar. He might get sandwiches & toast back! 
The weather was beautiful all day. I made another trip to Portland Nursery. Saw a hummingbird while I was there. I finished up the shade pallets (not all strawberry this year), pulled a bunch of morning glory, discovered three asparagus sprouts in the driveway strip, and planted kohlrabi & artichoke starts, along with a red huckleberry and a bunchberry start, and weeded Season Alley.  Really wishing J's truck was working so I could get the soil to level out the south side walkway, so I could get the ferns planted over there. Still, I should have enough leftover from doing the pallets that I can get one carrot bin going tomorrow. 

Tomorrow should be:  laundry, cooking for the week, lunch planning and prep, planting the last few starts I bought today, bike ride to drop off more LFL books, and cleaning up my room so it's easier to start my day on Monday. I don't *think* that sounds too ambitious..."

"event","Three days ago:  bike ride along the MUP, a part I haven't ridden since shortly after I got my bike. And rode it the other direction, which meant I got the *great* part of riding the hill! Whoosh!  Followed by getting turned around, doubling back, and making my way over to Cartlandia for lunch. They were packed! But for all the people there, I only spotted five bikes. I realize it was lunchtime on a workday, but still. Had a lovely chat with the gentleman who made my lunch, gave the ""fuck off and leave me to my lunch, already"" look to a couple of little maniac children, and made it home well before it started raining. 

Two days ago:  rode my bike to work to drop some stuff off (so I wouldn't have to carry it when I start back again on Monday). Had a quick chat with a couple of people in the building. Was quite glad to get the stuff out of my house. Managed to not ""just do a couple of things while I'm here"" - go me, sticking with the work/personal boundary! Got just outside the building - the six or so steps to get the bike past the door so I can get my helmet and gloves on - and the CRACK of lightning hit! followed maybe 1.5, 2 seconds by a HUGE BOOM of thunder!  Why yes! Let me get on my all-metal-bike-frame and power myself home now! Was soaking wet when I got home. 
Talked with my dad for a while. Sounds like he and his neurodoc have his meds pretty well sorted out and things are going well in that area. OTOH, he's now got his entire kitchen torn up for a remodel, and he of course isn't scaling back on any of his activities, so that means more physical labor, more stress in trying to keep up with everything, and the stress of not being able to have people over because half the kitchen gear is in the living and family rooms. We made loose plans for getting together after the remodel is a bit more under control.
Also made a date with an old friend to - hopefully - have one of his kids over to help me in the yard on Saturday, and to visit with my friend and his wife a while. We'll see if he bails at the last minute - though to be fair, it's worked out for two of the last three tries to get together that got past the initial planning stages. 

Yesterday:  Took a handful of books to a neighborhood Little Free Library. Did the dishes after Michael fixed the sink, which apparently was part of why the dishwasher was screwed up. Finished <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29"">The Martian</a> late last night. I don't usually read much sci-fi, but at least three people close to me were pushing for me to read it, enough so that one of them bought it for me while we were at Powell's and put it in my hands and made me promise to read it. Okay! Okay!  And yes, I enjoyed it far more than I'd expected to. Was thoroughly, entirely snuggled by cats one way or another all night and into this morning. This alone is argument enough against going back to work next week. 

Today: Took care of some errands, walked the mall with Other M - and threw her to the 'makeup artists' at one of the Beauty shops (they did a nice job, too), and had a lovely dinner with her at my favorite sushi place. Watched a good share of the Justin Bieber roast with Michael - who the hell wrote Martha Stewart's material? She pretty much stole the entire show. Had some lovely snuggle time with Michael. I like that the prednisone doesn't steal him away all the time.

Tomorrow:  If the weather isn't too bad early in the day, I may work on the yard, getting some more things planted and some weeds pulled. If the weather craps out early i in the day, it's making another huge batch of freezer waffles.  Tomorrow evening: Band get-together!  We'll see how the weather holds up - I won't likely bus my bass across town if it pours outside. But I would like to make it at least to the first couple of band meetings as the group starts sorting itself out. 

Two days from today: Fun errands with Michael. I finally get to spend my Portland Homestead Supply winnings! And part of my Bob's Red Mill winnings! I've got the evening to myself, so I may take over the kitchen for one project or another. Or, since the house will be quiet, I may start reading my book for work. 

Three days from today: Hopefully having my friend's kid help me in the yard for a while. Hopefully getting to visit with them, either way. It seems like there's something going on that night, but I can't remember what it is. Maybe I'd been thinking that was going to be the band meeting."

"event","I finally got started working in the yard this week. I spent a couple of hours yesterday weeding boxes. Today Michael and I topped off and fertilized about 3/4 of the beds. I planted most of the handful of annuals for the herb bed, and we're still waiting to see if the curry and the pineapple sage come back. I got the native shade garden replanted as well - two ferns and the stream violet lives, the wild gingers didn't make it, and the bunchberry looks like crap but might pull through. I added a trillium, a starry false-solomon's seal, and two red columbines. 
I pulled out all of the bird baths too. We'll have to see if we can get the solar pump fixed for the one bird bath - it was pretty popular among the birds & bugs last year! I also replanted the three mini-planter boxes that will hang in the ""alley"" in the backyard - miniature thymes & mints, so there are a couple of sensory components back there. I haven't yet found the little glass art bits I had hanging back there. Hopefully they'll turn up soon. I also cleared out a bunch of the dead vines & stalks that didn't decompose over winter, cleared out the stakes we *koff* forgot to bring in over autumn, and pulled some ivy.

Tomorrow (or maybe the next day) will be drawing up this year's garden plan so I remember what went/goes where, planting spinach and bok choi starts, planting all sorts of seeds, and maybe starting on yanking the morning glory. I'm so not looking forward to dealing with that damned morning glory. 

I need to find a new non-electronic weather station for the yard as mine finally died from UV exposure. I knew it wouldn't take terribly long, but I'm sad anyway. Actually, part of it is still good - I should just cobble together good versions of all the parts I want, since I can't find a durable pre-assembled station like I want. 

Maybe tomorrow will be working on the Little Free Library too. I just need to find the paint I bought and make the stencil."

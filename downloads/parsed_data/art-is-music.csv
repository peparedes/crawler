Oh shit!  I'm at max on kissing!  Watch out sluts.  
And yes, I suck at flirting.  You know like when you make eye contact and look away really quick?  yeah that's me.  FAG.


<u>Update:</u>
I saw 3 fireflies.  Shut up Freddie.

Kyle's taking kung fu and he taught me how to crane strike.  Now I'm hitting everyone.

Getting an insane haircut soon.

Megaman Collection comes out today!

Playing shows on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday.

Hopefully tats next month.

I really have to pee right now, but am too lazy to get up.

Make Believe-  Awesome set.  Love the music.  Check them out.  I bought a cd.

Need New Body-  Interesting music.  Electric banjo with two keyboardists, two percussionists, and vocals and bass.  Kinda liked them?  eh?

HELLA-  Best part of the night.  Zach Hill the drummer is so fuckin' amazing.  I think it was better than their last show but both were still super amazing.  Zach busted his finger open and was bleeding everywhere.  That man, is the man.

1.  Had to stand in line for 30mins to get inside just to realize we missed Mars Volta.

2.  Josh Freese, the drummer for APC and many other bands, broke his right knee cap and played everything off his left foot.  Amazing.

3.  APC sound was terrible as uaual.

4.  Realized I hate huge shows because of stupid drunks and sluts.


<u>Highlights</u>
1.  Got to see the show with  my drum buddy John.  :)

2.  Met Billy and Jordy from A Perfect Circle after the show.

<b><u>BOOKS!
Blue Print Sea
Tank Tank
An Albatross

I probably spelt some of those wrong but Blue Print Sea,An Albatross, and Don Cab made this show.


Today:

<b><u>Grabass Charlestons
The Lawrence Arms
Dillinger Four
Against Me!
The (International) Noise Conspiracy</b></u>

Best bands of the night, Dillinger Four and The (International) Noise Conspiracy.  I really don't like punk so that's probably why I didn't enjoy this show too much.  This was the first time for me to TINC and it was good.  Not the best, but good.  All in all, one of the most boring shows I've ever been to.

Holy crap!  What a fun show!  I got to sit upstairs cuz I'm 21 now and had the perfect view.  <b>Kyle</b> gave me a filter mask to protect me from the smoke.  Awesome.  I bought a Locust apron.  I'm totally going to make it into a hoodie jacket.  I can't wait!


<u>Tonight, Friday:</u>

<b>Skin Trade
Bullet Train to Vegas
Tokyo Sex Destruction</b>


again, another awesome show.  John's band ripped it up as usual.  Bullet Train was pretty good.  I talked to them about getting shows with them.  :)  

Tokyo Sex Destruction was simply amazing.  Think the Hives but 10000000000 better.  I almost started dancing.  and Kent doesn't dance.  It was that good.

I bought a Tokyo Sex Destruction shirt and Bullet Train to Vegas cd.  I'm poor again.



<u>In the Mail</u>
<b>Jen Light</b> sent me my Vday package finally!  It was so amazing!  I was seriously giddy.  haha  

Inside:
Bag o' candy
Red Duck Swimming Goggles
Sugar Glider Card
Amazing custom scarf with a pic of her printed on it

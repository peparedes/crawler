"event","You make me want to re-evaluate everything, and all the time. 
It's a very good thing though. You sort of keep me in check, because I think you know me a lot better then a lot of people, or you know the old Amy at least. I have changed and I like the change, but I also want to incorporate both the old Amy and the new Amy. I sort-of miss what you miss too. I don't know if that is even plausable. But it's up to me to figure something out. I don't want to say I am one thing because I am always learning and when I find better ideals, or come up with different solutions, I change. Everyone does; it's only logical. All I know is that I think this whole thing may be over. I don't know if we will ever cross paths again, but I don't see it happening. Just remember that I did offer to spend time sharing our ideas with each other and I was willing to come with an open-mind. This whole thing, this whole chapter in my life, it's done.

Next Chapter..."

Remember: There are no contradictions. Check your premises. 

I never really understood the meaning of this until a couple days ago."

"event","<b>I discovered today that one of my biggest pet peeves is inconsistent behavior.</b>

All the offices ladies know that I am always hungry because I don't have a lot of time to eat, so they are so nice and always bring me little snacks. Flo, the old receptionist that is about to retire, made this strawberry desert. She put some in a container for me and gave it to me when I got to work. They are all so nice to me. 

The young salesmen always call me pretending to be weirdos.

Aaron and I are going to get food, rent a movie, make a fort, and play video games, and stay up all night. We are going to have a sleepover."

"event","1. I love fish sticks. And NOT fish fillets. Cheap fish sticks are so much better then those dumb fish fillets.
2. I love myself. I like who I have become, what I am doing, and how I deal with people.
3. When I hear people complain and whine it makes me sing in my head. It makes me get up and walk away because I can't listen to that shit without it making me go crazy. 
4. When the same people are constantly depressed it makes me mad. I don't like to listen to them, and I don't know how to be nice to them. They are frustrating.
5. Al Dunlop is my hero; he is a ruthless, successful businessman.
6. I wish I were surrounded with brutally honest people. People who had control of their emotions, and people who had a good concept of life and priorities.
7. I love five people: my grandma, my mom, my sister, her fiance, and my boyfriend.
8. My favorite color is green, and my favorite symbol is the dollar sign.
9. I don't want Mr. Schertzer to die ever. I will be really sad if he does. But if he does, he said he is going to give me all his history.
10. I love life. The reason for my beliefs, my actions, and my thoughts are all because happiness is my #1 priority and I have the biggest love of life."

"event","The gaudy boat was lined with frivolous jewels and on board was nothing but the banter of rich aristocrats in their teflon knickers. But amidst the fat yuppies stuffing their smug faces with the smorgasbord of sweet foods, were two sneaky terrorists named Hugo and Vespucci, named after the Italian explorer after whom America was named. They were on their knees praying to their malicious God of Terror. Hugo was pondering their master plan of demise, while Vespucci swiftly ate a hoard of worms; delicacies he considered them. They discarded their clothing as the weather was hot and humid. What other weather would you expect when the boat is afloat on top of hot magma, deep inside the earth? This boat was certainly not ordinary. It was alive, flowing with blood in deep florescent veins. As the boat walked down the center of the earth, the terrorists began to weave their web of joy. You see, on this strange boat, anger was accepted as the social norm, while happiness was discouraged with every emotion possible. Hugo and Vespucci wanted to spread joy throughout the boat like a plague of Egypt."

"event","This weekend was most rewarding. I did something different everyday. 
Aaron and I ate mexican food and fell asleep. Saturday night Nik and I went to Cabaret. Sunday, Lilly, Matt, Scott, and I rented movies and bought pizza, and then Aaron joined us, and we had a sleepover. In the morning we made omelets and I kicked their asses at Fusion Frenzy. 

Today Aaron and I went to the Wave, and then went to his parents house. We jumped into the pool, and then ate delicious shrimp and steak. 

I went swing dancing tonight, which was fun, except I was sitting so deep in thought, I decided to leave, and go home."

I went dancing last night at Neiman's. It was slow at first, and I was a little bored. But then I danced a lot, and I sweated a lot. I have horrible blisters on my feet. Mr. Huynh said I am getting better, which makes me feel accomplished. I got such a work-out though. I really hate P.E., but I finally found a form a great excersize that I really enjoy. Not only do I enjoy doing it, and as often as possible, but I enjoy the way I feel afterwards. I feel tired, and weak, like I just ran for miles and miles. And I feel healthy, like I just did something great for myself. 

I was thinking last night, that despite how much I hate math, it really is interesting, and that maybe I don't hate it as much as I think. I love Spanish, and I like Business Management, but I can't say it is very exciting (in the way it is taught). I think the only thing I need to like the subject is the teacher. The teacher is what determines if it will be something I will enjoy or not. If I had a good teacher in every subject, I would enjoy the class, regardless of whether I liked the subject or not.

He took me out to breakfast. 
He spent the night and we were watching a movie. I started to fall asleep and he was running his fingers through my hair and held me until I fell asleep. This morning we washed each others hair.

He was prying inside my mouth, and hurt me with his pick-like utensil, and I started having a panick attack. After he told me I have 6 cavities, and that each tooth will require a shot, I started bawling. The nurse was comforting and helpful, while the doctor was insincere, and made me feel very uncomfortable. He would ask me questions, and they could only be answered with, ""...YOU ASSHOLE."" He would just stare at me incredulously. He was like, ""It's not that big of a deal."" Obviously showing that a) he didn't understand my discomfort, and b) couldn't see that I was obviously scared of needles, even though I told him that I was several times, and wrote that on the forms I filled out. I answered, ""It is a big deal with a Dr. who is so non-chalant about pain."" 

Needless to say, I requested that they put on my paperwork that I am never to see him again.

"event","I was the only one to get 100% on the grammar test, so I made the final grammar test meaning I don't have to take it. I also don't have to take the final for having 100%, but I if I don't show up tomorrow I fail the class. ...I love the education system. 

Anyhow, I went to the Souplantation orientation and saw Kendra and Ali on my way in and it was nice because Ali gave me a hug and they were both friendly. And now I want to hang out with them some. They paid me for orientation! All we did was sit down and go over paperwork. 

I went over to Aaron's and then home to work, and told him to come over at 7 but he didn't show. 

Today is my last day of summer school and then I am free of silly responsibilities not worth my time. 

My grandma and my mom are still up talking in the living room, and they are funny people. Especially when my grandma comes in my room inquiring about depression and if Aaron and I are in a fight because I have been sleeping since 7:30 pm."

I just heard this on TV:

Jay Leno: I was told you have been mistaken for a famous person. Who?
Random Black Lady: Yeah, Whoopi.
::picture shown comparing the two:: (they don't look anything alike)
Jay Leno: Haha, Oh really?
Random Black Lady: ::sigh:: White people."

I went to the Oceanside fair and bought my mom a gift, and ate a caramel apple.
Lately I have really been wanting to hang out with anyone. Like Michelle M., Sabrina, Alli, Lauren S., Dave P., just anyone. But everyone's lazy and can't pick up a phone or leave a comment.

I am ready for a change of scenery. I want a road trip."

I went to the thrift store and found a shirt and skirt, and a pair of brand new converse in the dumpster. 
Aaron and I took some photobooth pictures, which I should scan and show.
We watched a movie and ate BBQ chicken sandwhiches. 

Dates to remember:
July 23rd - Jimi's
July 10th - Jimi's

I need to set dates to go to the museum in San Francisco, and also see Aaron's brothers. Maybe go up there one day, stay for 2, and then come back the 4th day."

I enjoy when people are selfish. 

I just like it. 

I have this urge to do something, and I really don't know what. I feel like I should be driving somewhere or doing something incredibly productive. 

I couldn't get along with anyone who doesn't like living. 

""So you aren't out living life like your sister is.""
""I live life in my own way.""

I really don't like what Jesus stands for. He is selfless and unconstitutional."

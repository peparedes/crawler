okay so, the weather was not permitting for a beach date, so i got a phone call from andy telling us to stay in our rooms...then we heard a knock and brady escorted us in his minivan to J's room, when we pulled up we werent allowed to open the doors..boys were standing there with roses and they each escorted one of us and handed us a rose, we walked up the stairs and into the dark room where candles lit the doorway and derek and brian were taking our shoes off. the floor was covered in white sheets, pillows and rose petals..then i looked over to the counter and saw the boysss

"event","oh wow...it's definitely been a LONG while...such a long while that LJ has changed formats on me, and i'm trying to figure out what the hell they've changed...

it's winter break...and for the first time in years...there is close to no academic stress during winter break. no looming finals from material i've learned over the past semester. no homework. nothing. besides financial crap. but it's still not all that fulfilling. 

you know, sometimes i wish i went to school further away, so i could really appreciate these times when everyone is getting back together, and remembering, and reconnecting themselves back with their portland home..but i just don't feel it. this break feels like nothing more than an extended weekend home with the parentals again. except for the occasional visits and calls from people who are home, calling to talk, ask how i am, see if i can get out to see them...it feels the same. there are all of these feelings of growth and maturity going around, ""hey, i've just survived my first semester at college. and i'm home!"" but i don't feel like any of that has happened for me. my school's so tremendously small that sometimes i just feel like i'm back in high school with a few minor changes here and there. i'm home so frequently that i don't get a chance to really miss portland, not that i've experienced that much of portland to miss. i talk to my parents so much (not voluntarily <i>because</i> it's so much) that even seeing them, for an extended period of time...i don't know. whatever issues i have with my parents, i sometimes feel that if i were able to get away for a while, i'd be able to appreciate them. but they don't allow it. they don't allow me to actually think about my relationship with them. i try my best to get them, understand where they're coming from...but they're just at me so constantly that whatever..feelings of understanding i might develop over a day are completely dashed away the second they call me at 1130 at night, yelling at me because i haven't called them for the day yet. they just ... expect me to answer to them like i always have. and for me to be ok with it. and i'm too scared shitless to confront it. i really think i just need to get away from them for a while. but that's not really possible, even if it could mean saving our relationship in the long run. even in the crappy state it's in now...

wow, didn't think this would turn into a parental rant...i mean, i really cant complain. winter break hasn't been that bad. i mean...my grades were good (better than i definitely expected), so my parents were pleased. for about a day. before they started ranting on me about my B+ in history. my sister was home for a week, so i got out, and wasn't sitting on my butt all the time like i am right now...i've seen a couple of people...only because they've been sweet, nice, and understanding enough to come to me, knowing that even asking me to meet them halfway is not likely to happen. i've seen ryan a couple of times. i got out on my own for the first two days of break, so that was nice. i mean, overall, this break really wasn't <i>bad</i>. so i guess i'm happy. 

let's just say i'm really looking forward to going back to school on the 2nd though. even if it means i'm missing out on the alumni speak out that i've been looking forward to since it happened last year (i'm a dork, i know...i was just excited to represent whatever school i might have ended up going to. gotta have pride..). 

but hey, i'm not far...anyone who's home for a long extended period of time after the new year's...i'll be just an hour away. 35-45 minutes if you drive fast...i'd welcome visitors! though...it is mcminnville, so i'd totally understand if you want to stay as far away from mactown as you can...

mmm...ok. i'm done. this was stupid. i apologize for all who read through it all. everyone who's home though? i've really missed you guys. it's nice to know that you're all back in town. and if i could, and wasn't still so restricted on the things that i do...i could actually hang out with you, instead of just thinking about you guys, and wondering if you are all doing well in the midwest/east coast...i hope you all are enjoying your winter break!"

"event","lol. i wish it was forever. but...to be honest, i'm kind of excited about the whole college experience. it's going to be a drastic change (hopefully) from the life i'm leading now, and yet at the same time, i'm hoping that it doesn't change too much. because i'm kinda happy right now...

i have to say that senior year has definitely been the best year of high school. yes, i didn't get out much, didn't do the whole coffee time, out until the wee hours, screw homework, going to council crest thing, but..i got out. kinda. =P well, at least i wasn't always at home when i wasn't at school. i had my library thing (oh god, the most wonderful 2 hour break from reality EVER), my hospital thing (something i did for me. and me alone. and it felt GOOD.)...my conniving, sneaky ways of getting out for ""IB""/""studying"" things, when they weren't really. or even, just stupid little group projects where we all got together to get work done. and didn't actually. OR. even better, got stuff done and had fun during the process. haha. dorky, i know. but hell. writing that script was a blast. and sending out the emails afterwards was amazing. granted, the script changed...(for the better), but still. i shall always remember the awkwardness that was never present between daniel and i, until that ONE moment in english class. *sigh*...

i'm kind all over the place tonight. today...is significant. to be totally cliche, if you had told me a year ago today that my life would be the way it is..i wouldn't have believed it. me going to school in-state. me in love. the friends i've grown closer to, or ... worse, grown further from. if i sit and think about it for a while, it becomes overwhelming. how, if this much changed over this past year and all my friends were still around me...just around the corner...what's it gonna be like this time next year? after we've all been to our different parts of the states? or, to include the few going out of the country, to our different parts of the world? 

i wish everyone the adventure that we are all entitled to. it's college! yet another cliche, but totally true. another step that we have to take in our lives. 

i don't know how to eloquently put any of this. i just...after all of the things that each of us have been through and all of the shit and crap that we've all put up with..no regrets guys. if i'm leaving behind high school without regrets...don't let yourselves do so. it's been a great four years, however we spent it. and i choose to remember the many days i could never stop laughing. when people gave me looks as i walked down the hallways because...well, let's face it. i seriously was acting like i was high on something. the days when silent, heartfelt smiles were spread all around (oh man. i'm being SOOO cliche). the hugs. sitting together silently while emotions were high. the silly greetings and (yes, zeb, i actually enjoyed them) the hair rubbing. the appearances of cameras all around, seeing emily just silently pull out her camera as she sneakily caught someone in a quite appealing...position? (that came out so wrong.) motion? (that's worse.)

i don't know where i was going with this...hmm...something along the lines of we did it guys! and... there's still WEEEEEEEKS left of freedom, of friends, of...whatever we want to make of it. let's make it something great, eh? =D"

"event","i haven't posted an lj post in a while. and one of substance in even longer. so i figured i'd do one now, while my sister is laying in her bed, napping and i'm wide awake with nothing to do. well..i COULD read song of solomon before my english group KILLS me when i get back...but...eh. what's another 15 minutes? (that book is TWISTED. and i haven't even gotten past chapter 3. 6 more to go? i think so. crap.)

so, for all of you who don't know, i'm in vegas. with my sister. and not my parents. it's been a <i>great</i> five days. or has it been six? well, whatever. it's been pretty awesome. i dont' think i'll go through a daily account of what happened because i know that's going to bore ALL of you, but essentially, my sister and i have gone shopping, visited san diego, ate, watched movies...and that's about it. it's insane how much stuff i've gotten. spring is officially here people. i've got my new batch of clothes and shoes and flip flops. have i mentioned the fact that i'm going to be wearing flip flops whenever possible now? 'cause i am. and i will. when it's sunny. and not pouring. 

hmm...so...i wonder if maybe i SHOULD go into more details on my trip. seeing as how i'm already running out of things to say. except...this really wouldn't be a post of substance, which was my objective to begin with. dangit. even when i leave for spring break my life is pretty uneventful. haha. well, okay. i visited san diego because i wanted to go see university of san diego to see if i wanted to go there. as i remember saying in one special, specific phone call made later that night, that school is WHITE. seriously. like, you're miles away and you can still look up that hill, and see it. it's white. it's big. it's there. there's really no other way to describe it. it's very obviously a religiously affliated school, which has been my reasoning for not wanting to go to university of portland (why did i apply to that school again? oh. confidence booster, right? yeah...didn't need that. and it's totally biting me in the butt now, isn't it?), but my real reasoning for not wanting to go to UofP? well, i don't have to tell you guys. just look at the name. usd on the other hand. well, look at the name. =) i don't know though. i hate the fact that i've got to make a decision soon. and i hate the fact that the decision i make won't be about where i WANT to go, but where i CAN go. and i hate the fact that every time college comes up as a topic between my parents and me, my dad always manages to slip in, ""i don't know what i'm going to do when you go away."" or...""your mom and i are getting old..don't you want to be able to be here for us when we do..?"" it kills me. it really does. slowly and surely it does. doesn't he realize that every time he makes that comment it makes me want to go away THAT much more? eh. well, he'll find out eventually. when i go off to school. and don't come back every weekend. even if i am only about an hour away. i really wish i had a better relationship with my father. but honestly. with these unspoken restrictions, what exactly does he expect? eh.

wow guys. sorry. that wasn't supposed to turn into a rant. that was just...whoops. yeah, so san diego? good food. BEACH!!!!!! school. it was awesome. the drive back was horrendous. it was POURING for about 2 hours of it. we got TONS of chocolate for the way home. yeah...my sister and i on chocolate? you all should have been there. =P

okay. i need to get ready for dinner and the musical tonight. so, want to get a sample of how much my sister and i have been eating? sushi buffet saturday night. HUGE barbecue dish from lucille's bbq last night. some major leftovers from that this morning. now, pancakes before rent. sushi after rent. can you tell we like sushi? oh. well, we dont' like sushi. we LOVE sushi. so essentially, all people in our lives must like sushi. okay, maybe not. but we love sushi. and anyone who loves sushi too. okay, maybe not that either. i'm done. 

peace out guys. and i'll see you in a few days!! =)"

alright, <lj-cut text=""here goes..."">

<i>So this story could be about how I pierced my ear with a fishing lure. Yeah that was fun. Or it could be about how every time I go fishing with my dad I always fall in the water and get soaked. I think I'll talk about how I pierced my ear with a fishing lure. I went on a fishing trip with my dad awhile back and we get up pretty early around 4 or 5ish to get on the road. And yeah so this time, when we went I hadn't fallen in the water yet so I was happy. But it was about 6:30 or 6:45ish in the morning when we hit a money spot where we've always had a lot of luck. There are a lot of trees there so it's a bit dangerous if you are accident prone like me. : Lol so I cast off a few times, doing pretty well, not getting snagged on anything. Ah but I spoke too soon, fore the very next cast I get snagged on a tree branch on the opposite bank. Uh-oh that's never good. That usually means that you have to cut the line and sacrifice the lure (which is probably what I should have done) or yank really really really hard until it comes loose or the line snaps or the branch breaks. Lol. My decision was to yank. I wrap the line around my arm and tug it a bit to make sure it's really stuck. It is. I pretty much take all I've got and yank as hard as I can back towards me. Stupid move. The good news is that it came free. The bad news is that I now had a lure with a treble hook (a hook with three sharp ends, kind of like an anchor) flying right at me at a billion trillion mph (small bit of exaggeration there but not really). It being so early in the morning there was some light coming from the sunrise but not much, meaning it was really hard to see. Even in broad daylight I still probably would never have seen it coming. I kinda turn my body to the left a bit to shield my, well you know the important things in life. Just as I turn I get blindsided by the lure as it nails my in the side of the head with one the hooks in my earlobe. Im telling you that lure had like 3 G's of force behind it cuz it hurt. I went down flying down the in the direction the lure was traveling. I get up and my dad looks at me. Laughs ""what a dork"" : he says as he walks over. ""Well Ryan, you have successfully pierced your ear with a hook that has a barb on the end of it. Not what I would have done. If you wanted your ears pierced you should have just asked"" So he takes out his pliers and gets it out. And yeah, it was a perfect piercing accompanied with a bruise on the side of my head.</i> 


yeah...so he's pretty awesome, isn't he?</lj-cut>

"event","strange dreams and interesting conversations...

i had that one dream again. where i was out late? and came home, the next morning, at 7? only this time, i'm not sure if it was seven, or just the next morning...but it was definitely not a time that i should be getting in from partying. the horrible thing was i was in college this time. and my father was still there. oh goodness, the creepiness of it all. even worse would have been if i had walked in drunk, stumbling over myself, with a guy groping me. anyway! just a dream. or nightmare. whatever. it's all good. just thought i'd share. might give a laugh to someone. if not, i apologize for making you go through this paragraph...

and second? my interesting conversations? hmm...my weekends have not been lacking in these since..december. it's been...nothing less than entertaining...

 ""Nick H"" [7:26 PM]:  did you know that the bali princes were selected
 ""Nick H"" [7:26 PM]:  and im not one of them
 DeeQT143 [7:28 PM]:  yes, i did know. 
 DeeQT143 [7:28 PM]:  i knew...on wednesday. did you JUST find out? 
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  like friday
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  it made me VERY happy
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  zeb as well
 DeeQT143 [7:29 PM]:  hmm 
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  and so
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  like the grinch
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  i decided to forgive everyone
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  wait no im mixing things up
 ""Nick H"" [7:29 PM]:  what am i thinking of??
 DeeQT143 [7:30 PM]:  that wasn't the grinch, was it? 
 ""Nick H"" [7:30 PM]:  no

hmm..i don't know. i was amused. who would even think of comparing themselves to the grinch? and inaccurately so? anyway...just one example. not a very good one. 

i'm off to do economics. history. spanish art studying. a bit of the bio packets. tok journal...basically ALL of my homework for this entire weekend in a matter of hopefully only 4 hours....well, 3. grey's anatomy is on tonight. =P

night all! have a fantabulous sunday night. and i'll see you all. bright and early. for the first day of our finals week! =)"

"event","why, oh why, can i not sleep?!?! I was laying (lying? whatever) in bed at around...1? In bed. Waiting. Counting sheep. Two hours later, I thought, screw it. And now, here I am. Asking you all. Is this not ironic? I am going to pull an all-nighter. On a night when I don't have anything to do. Seriously. How much more irony do you need??

So, as a result, I am now sitting at my computer. Writing my UW Honors Essay. It's crappy. But a nice interpretation of the first question. Oh well. I'm just going to go with it. Maybe I'll share. Depends on whether or not my confidence in it increases or decreases when I'm done. =P (Likely to decrease, but it's cool...)

thought i'd add this in. might be interesting, especially if you look at the people who read my LJ...;) just kidding, i love you guys. but seriously. july? tiff? stop drinking so much coffee. =P

THANKS to EVERYONE who edited my paper. and to EVERYONE who complimented my paper. you guys are awesome awesome awesome. and total confidence-boosters! i think college stuff is energizing me and leaving me completely drained at the same time. like...i've never been more excited about college stuff (especially since it seems as though i've written a decent essay that could be used for many of my other college apps...), and...so, i've been spending a lot of time on college things. but of course, that's leaving me so tired because i've also been doing homework/school stuff, ee stuff (kind of)...yeah...CUH-RAZY. this is the first year where i actually feel semi-productive! wooooooohoooooooo! 

my parents asked me today what day i got out of school for the year. and not thinking about it, i just said, late may, early june...after walking back up the stairs to my room, it hit me again. when i get out of school this year...well, i'll be out of school. HIGH SCHOOL. gone. bye bye. isn't that crazy?! and in a couple of weeks (about three), we'll be in the same year as the year we graduate! TWO THOUSAND AND SIX! 

and i'm done freakin' out. lol. off to read hamlet. edit my essay...do history review/reading...something...it's only 8:30. the night is young. =) peace."

"event","alright. for the ones who read my LJ regularly, you all know me pretty well. for those of you who read my LJ sporadically, well....you <i>might</i> know me well enough to help me out here! My USC application essay is due the 10th. I was hoping to write this exciting (yes!) essay tomorrow. Get some people to edit it throughout the week and have it ready by this Saturday...my issue right now is that i have <i>no</i> idea which of the three topics i should write about. in all honesty, i'm just not good at writing these sorts of essays.

so, in short, i was hoping that those of you who know me well, and know things of my life, could help me find something about me (or my life) that would satisfy one of these essay topics and allow me to write an outstanding essay (that'll help me get into USC!) So, here they are!

1. the 18th century philosopher Denis Diderot said, ""only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things."" describe one of your passions and discuss its contribution to your personal growth.

2. it is common knowledge that thomas edison invented the light bulb. Less well known is the fact that he failed 6,000 times before succeeding. Reflect on an accomplishment you achieved in an unlikely way.

3. newton's first law of motion states that an object in motion tends to stay in motion in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force. tell us about an external influence (a person, an event, etc.) that affected you and how it caused you to change direction.

alright. so, lookign at these, it seems as though 1 is the most likely option for me...except...maybe not. see? this is why i need your help!!!!!! =) (and when i'm finished writing, i will <i>again</I> need your help.) tons of friendship points (that are really truly worth nothing because you guys already all have a massive amount) for anyone who can help me in the SLIGHTEST way!

"event","so, everyone's turning in college apps! well, a lot of people are starting their submitting portions of applications anyway since the uc deadline is tomorrow. (or technically today, seeing as how it's 12:04.) 

i'll have to agree with pie. applying to college is exhausting. i've only turned in one app (one that doesn't really matter <i>that</i> much to me), and i'm pooped. lol. it's exhilarating at the same time though. because imagine how great it'll be when we get our acceptance letters (because we will ALL get acceptance letters to our schools) and there will be joy. and no more stress (kind of. screw ib exams). and....freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedom.

you guys have <i>noooo</i> idea how much i'm looking forward to college. and no, it's not to party. no matter how much ribbing goes on about how i'm going to go insane in college, i will not be drunk whenever you guys decide to just call me up and say hi. ;) although, the thought is <i>realllly</i> funny. i'm just excited to do the little things....going out on a whim for coffee, taking a random stroll through campus (yes, scoping for guys. haha), finally getting to decide my own things for my own reasons (basically not having to take into account my parents 24/7). 

i'm excited. and happy. too bad this application that i sent in was to a college in portland. oh well. the next two are in seattle and la. i'm good. =) (or...maybe i'll get into northeastern with lots of financial aid, and i'll be in boston. on the east coast. boston massachusetts. BOSTON! and i'm done.)

"event","and i thought i'd share since i don't want to actually write up my economics commentary.

so anyway. at first, when i woke up, i thought this little dream should be categorized as a nightmare. but after some thought, and a little discussion, i've determined that it's definitely a dream. a lovely dream. except the ending wasn't so great (hence, the initial nightmare categorization). 

further explanation is needed i guess. well, although i'm procrastinating on homework, i don't really have much time for a full-on explanation. so here's tidbits of information:

1. i have a thing for older men apparently. 
2. 7 o'clock curfews (nope. not pm. am.)

staying out until 7 o'clock in the morning, at a friend's apartment with an older man. now <i>that's</i> a dream. *sigh* haha. too bad it ended with me waking up as i walked in the door from school (yes, i had school the next morning. damn the fact that i was still in high school in this dream), to find my father sitting at the kitchen table with crossed arms and a cup of coffee. not so good.

(i've gone from never seeing my counselor to seeing her twice a week. that's funny.) breaking down. biology test. finding out that i can't do simple math (that was sad.). anyway! yeah. this week has been sooo intense. 

for those of you who don't know, i am now the first student for the literacy project that's going on at sunset. so now i've got to come up with a book, quote from the book, and a quote about reading. sweeeeet. haha. it's insane. and ask aleks about his funny story about totally calling whose name would get picked out of the jar. what's even funnier is that if kim barela had been there i wouldn't have been it. ooooor....if mr. pillette hadn't been the one handed out the cards to put names on, i wouldn't have even been in the jar. (meaning, i was too scared of him to even say no to putting my name on a card.) but there is an awesome part. i'm the first student ever to have a poster. so that'll be awesome. i'll be known as that girl on that poster you see in the hall. you know, the awesome one? designed by rachel belgard??

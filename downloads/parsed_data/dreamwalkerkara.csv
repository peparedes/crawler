"event","I saw Inception on Thursday with Joel.  I had a dream last night that had Joel in it and had to be based on that movie.

Here's what happened.  So Joel and I were doing some crazy stuff, it's like we were in this techno world, and you know how in lucid dreams there are certain thing you *know* without having seen them in the dream?  Yeah, we had already been in a world before where we jumped off a building and woke up.  That was previously known knowledge.  

Anyway, we're in this technologically advanced place, and the layout is two building roofs, but there are these little platform things that took you from one roof to the other because it was a loooong way down and if we fell, we'd be falling forever.  

So Joel and I are on roof number 1, which is somehow our exit point as well as the place we need to get away from because Kremlings (yes, the lizard people from DK) are coming after us with spacesuits and guns.  I'd think of them more as Judoon from Doctor Who, except lizards rather than rhynos.

So we get on the platforms, go to roof number two and break into that building, and we get something important, but somehow I'm lookout so I spot the Judoon Kremlings coming on platforms toward us, so I scream for Joel to finish whatever he's doing so we can get out of here.  We go to meet them, and try to sidestep them, but one of them knocks me off the platform and I start falling to my doom.  I don't wake up and it's a continuous falling through different sceneries.  Of course, I realize that I'm dreaming at that point and decided to get deathly afraid that I'd never wake up for real so I worked to pull myself out of my dream and it was weird, because suddenly, I was falling toward my tv on the computer desk.  I saw it and I focused on it and it was like trying to pull my body out of molasses before I suffocated or something, but I woke up, nonetheless.  And that's my weird-ass dream."

"event","I'm not over him.  In theory, him hanging out with his 'girlfriend' (in quotes because they're not actually in a relationship though he's wishing too hard for it to happen, and he's acting as though they are, though they're not) shouldn't bother me.  In reality when he brings her up for about half the conversation we had when he invited me over yesterday, it bothers me a lot.  He doesn't love her, and whatever relationship could possibly develop in the month he has left will only last until he goes back to Pullman.  I don't understand what his deal is, and I suppose it's none of my business, but I suppose with the thing with James falling through (or at least seeming hopeless), it's...  really prominent in my head...  

I fucking hate love.

I don't want to love Joel.  Not when he constantly treats me as less than a friend and brings up the other 'girlfriend' in his life.  Of course, the fact that I do love him supersedes all this relationship crap.  The fact is, he's changing aspects of his identity for this girl he doesn't even love, and I can't accept that...because I've made that mistake and had it shoved in my face...by him.  I love him too much to watch him do this...  watch him feel like he has to change who he is just to get a girl in his life when I'm sitting right here, ready to accept him for who he is, good and bad.

But, I came to terms with the fact a while ago that while I love Joel in the only way I know how, and I suppose he loves me in his own small way and we can be best friends until the ends of the earth and have each others' backs, we can never work as a relationship because we have issues.  For me it's trust; for him it's closeness, which I suppose is another type of trust, but I've seen too many times that he's willing to believe that he has no one in his life who cares and he's willing to cast everyone out to save them the burden.  I've done the same, which makes me cling harder to him, because... that time of my life was saddening...depressing.  I don't want him to feel like he has no one, because that simply isn't true.

But I have to move on...and I thought I did.  James was such an attractive possibility.  He's smart, funny, kind, cute, and we have common interests...sorta.  The sad thing is that he's...clueless.  I don't know how many 'You're awesome ;)' messages I have to leave him, how many 'I liked hanging out, we should do it again' lines I need to send his way, how many times I need to laugh hysterically at his jokes which may not be as funny as my reaction implies before he gets the hint that I'm interested.  Every single conversation we have on skype feels like flirting in some regards...but I've given him opportunities to make a move and he acts like he's interested...but doesn't make a move...

This Saturday we were supposed to hang out...  or rather, I proposed the possibility of hanging out because we both expressed interest in getting together before going back to Pullman, but...  he hasn't gotten back to me with a definite answer...  and it's Friday, for crying out loud.  I'd talk to him, but he's not getting online lately...

I'm just feeling...hopeless lately, like no one out there cares.  Joel constantly tells me that I'm one of the most beautiful people he knows, inside and out.  There's a constant reassurance that I'll find the guy.  My stepbrother Cory looked at me in awe when I told him I wasn't in a relationship, asking jokingly if all the guys I met were gay.  How much of this reassurance is exaggerated for my benefit?  How much of this is the obligation to say that everything will be okay?  I've worked so hard in the past year to gain confidence in my outward appearance, but I know it isn't enough.  I'm not that shallow, but the fact remains that we are a society that judges based on what we see.  I can change how I look to other people to match the fact that I'm smart, kind to those who extend the same courtesy, and generally know what I'm doing.  But...  how much is it going to take?  I've lost 50 pounds in the past year.  I'm down to a weight I haven't seen on the scale since junior high.  I've worn a bikini this summer for the first time EVER and felt confident in it.  What makes me so different from the other girls...so unattractive in comparison?  All I can do is work in the last month I have to go back to Pullman and knock everyone out.  Hopefully including the two (or three) guys whose attention I want most..."

In other, exciting news, my charger has officially been ordered, so it should hopefully be here by Thursday.  I'd like it before, butttt...  delivery systems are fail.

I might be seeing Inception on Thursday...  no, I will be seeing Inception on Thursday.  Joel invited me over so I'll be heading over there and hanging out for a while.  And I get to take the twins to the airport on Saturday, so it's looking like a lot of driving this week for me.  Not that I'm complaining...if something I want to happen ends up happening.

I just thought of a new project: taking a sketch I did years ago and fine-tuning it before uploading it to deviantart.  That's what I'm gonna do now.  I'm off."

"event","Last night was fucking horrible.

I don't even know what happened.  I left, I came back, and that's when shit hit the fan.  Things went out of control, and I was up until a shaky 4 am once again.

Luckily today, the kids took a premature exit.  That's both a plus and a minus.  Plus because maybe the stress levels will lower around here.  Minus because there is no buffer between myself and my mother.

I'm just tired.  I sat for three hours in Safeway parking lot with a packed car waiting for the kids' mother to get here so that they could go home and I could go home to a person I really didn't want to speak to or even bee in the same room as.

Plans are set in motion.  I'm heading out."

"event","Give or take a day...at least.  That's the only good thing I've experienced today: that revelation.  That, and finishing Narcissus in Chains.  On to the next one.  :)

My mom came home in one of her moods again, pissed off to the yin yang.  I suppose I can't blame her with all the stressful crap that's been going on as far as finances and family crap goes, but you know what?  Financially speaking, that was their own damn fault.  I have no sympathy for that, just a constant rising pissiness because they once again refused to listen to logic and instead decided to be...morons?  idiots?  the word that describes the true level of their idiocy escapes me at the moment.

At James's urging, I started my story last night...  at the true beginning this time.  I'm experimenting with how exactly I want to write it.  I'm thinking third person at the beginning which morphs into first person as the first part ends and the second part begins, but I started writing it in first person, so I'll see how that goes first, then I might try for third person, just to see what the difference would be.  It sure as hell would leave me freer, but I want that sense of a limited perspective going on.  I dunno.  

More good news.  My laptop, which is on day 5 of being out of commission, is about to be saved!  My parents have finally decided to give me the money to get on Amazon and buy the damned charger tomorrow.  Hopefully that will save my sanity from any more hits from making myself a nice little target in the living room.

I woke up thinking about him again this morning...  Logically, I should be backing off these thoughts, but they make me happy...giddy almost.   I can do with a bit of that at the moment...  Even if the feeling isn't justified, which I hope it is.  God, I hope it is...

I finally had to run into town today to just get away from everything.  It's just pissing me off being here.  Well, I had library business to take care of too, but more than that, I just needed to drive, go fast, leave my thoughts behind me, bring myself to nothing but the car, my focus, and my music.  That always calms me down at least a little.

My mother seems to want to snap at me as the proxy of everything that has been stressing her out and then use me as her shoulder to cry on.  I can't fucking take it anymore.  I'm her daughter, not her bloody therapist.

On that note I do believe I will go."

"event","I woke up to another note on the fridge listing tasks for us...  as if we're some kind of incompetent beings.  It's quite annoying. I finally decided to do the kitchen because no one else can bloody well do it right, and I'm a little territorial, even though no one can clean up their damned mess and I'm sick of dealing with it.

I suppose I'm gathering my mood from the fact that everyone else in this house seems to be stark-raving mad.  Or at least overly stressed to the point where I'm getting a headache from it.  Some family troubles, and my mother is trying to involve people who simply don't need to know and it's pissing me off.

I decided to do a little experiment in favoritism today.  You see, my stepsister Heather has been the bane of my mother's existence for a while because she's constantly waking up after noon and taking showers at 5 in the evening.  I decided today that I would take a shower at that time to see if mom got on my case.  No such anger towards me, just a lot of making sure I understood where the leaks were and whatnot.  I get out of the shower to find people yelling and slamming every which way from nowhere.  But it has nothing to do with me.  Hm.

Two hours later, she accuses my stepdad of playing favorites because he sends the little ones into the next room because a scene from the movie they're watching is inappropriate.  How interesting.  

I've been playing Pokemon intermittently throughout the day.  I've also been playing Legend of Dragoon throughout the day and reading Narcissus in Chains throughout the day.  It's become the three pillars of my summer.  With the exception of the weekly Joel visits (which won't be happening for the rest of the month) and the rare James visits (which I really hope to have happen again very soon), they're all I have, really.

You wanna know what really pisses me off?  More than my parents' stress level, more than idiots, more than the just amount of people in this house?  My parents knew the condition of their finances...and <i>still</i> decided to go on a week-long camping trip with two cars...  with all the boys.  Then they take it out on everyone else because they're suddenly out of money.  <i>Well I freaking wonder why?</i>

I'm talking to James now...  who is basically brightening my day as usual, encouraging me to write the story I haven't even touched in four years, and is making me all happy-giggly, which is so NOT me.  What's wrong with me, the self-called lone wolf?  The person who spent their life growing up beyond her years and could never make friends, let alone a bloody <i>relationship</i> work.  What am I doing thinking that something is possible?

Nonetheless, that hope is there.  Nonetheless, that hope is driving me through this summer, keeping me from completely shutting down.  When I am home, I am alone.  When my friends are around, I cling to them.  I can't wait to visit with my friends again.

PS: Laptop is STILL out of commission.  Can my parents please just give me ten bucks to go and put in my account so I can bloody well buy that charger?"

"event","My laptop is out of commission.  Luckily, James is helping me to not rip myself off.  My parents are in a constant state of stress and are taking it out on me, and treating myself and my stepsister Heater with so little respect, it isn't even funny.  Here I sit, in the ""dining"" room, a perfect target for my mother's rage because my laptop is out of commission and I can't actually go into my room and be online at the same time.  

Rather than be depressed, I'm being smart for the first time in a year or so, getting all of my music off this darned computer and onto my flash drive so I can actually listen to it again.  Whoo!

And once again my mother is involving me in some business of hers which is none of mine, and I constantly have to ask her to not involve me, but that doesn't happen.  She needs a therapist, not a daughter.

But lately, all that's been on my list is Legend of Dragoon, the Anita Blake series (which is awesome), pokemon, and a certain guy...  I feel like a blushing schoolgirl mentioning it, my not-so-little crush.

I met him randomly during one of my afternoon chemistry lectures.  We started by talking about desks, of all things.  A couple days later we traded info to form a study buddy kind of thing.  I thought it was going to be bothersome, but he was essentially, he was the first friend I met that wasn't dropped in front of me by either housing situation or grouped up by some other means.

I wound up helping him a lot more than he helped me, but it was fun nonetheless.  I found out we had a lot in common as far as anime goes, and we hung out.  His computer setup is quite impressive.

Of course, at this time, I was still having drama with Joel, another kid I met and became close friends with, so I didn't really consider anything other than a pure friendship...if not a mere meeting of acquaintances knowing how I usually act toward people I meet, but he turned into a very perceptive friend who gave me a lot of advice and seemed to know just what to say to make me feel better.  Also, the first person I have not considered a close friend I have ever cried in front of, to my embarrassment.

James...  makes me smile whenever I talk to him, makes me laugh with his jokes, and brightens my day.  He's nice, cute, and smart in his own way.  I'm trying to drop hints, but I don't know exactly how to make it any more obvious that I'm interested.  I want to make the first move, but at the same time, I don't know if I should let him do it.  I don't know if he's interested, which makes me nervous.

Well...  all I can do is wait and see, I suppose."

"event","Ummm...  yeah, here's a change.  To those of you who may or may not have frequented this journal at one time or another, I'm back.  I'm now on a summer break, soon to be going into my second year of college, and trying to find my own identity.  In my first year of university, I wound up losing a good 40+ pounds.  I met some good friends, friends I hope to have for a long time.  I've trusted some people for the first time in a long time.  I survived and I'm going back.  Hopefully to only improve on my search to find what I like and what I don't.  Hopefully to meet more people, form more relationships.  I'll keep this as a telling of my life through college...  for people who care to find out my experiences..."

"event","Okay, I'm going to start posting my entries in story form, simply because I have writer's block and I need something to be creative about...why not this?  Okay, let's go...off into the world of Kara...

<lj-cut text=""The World of Kara...pt 1""><u>The World of Kara, Pt 1:</u>

<b>3 AM...(only an estimation)</b>
Kara woke to a strange sound outside her window.  Opening her eyes revealed nothing but a pitch-black room.  Turning to look at her alarm clock, she found it to be blank.  <i>Shoot,</i> She thought, <i>the power's out.</i>

Looking out her window to judge what time it was, she found it to be dusk...obviously early in the morning.  With nothing to judge what time it was, she was able to find the derivation of the noise that had woken her: it was the wind.  There were three specific, and very tall trees that were swaying dangerously in the wind.  She knew that there was practically no danger at all, considering that the trees were nowhere near reach of her flimsy trailer, but she couldn't help but be a bit weary of what else was happening outside.  She spent who knows how long just staring at the three pillars outside her window, wondering when/if they would fall.  Finally, after what seemed like forever, she fell asleep.

<b>4:30 AM</b>

Kara woke to another noise...it was an insistant beeping that brought her out of her otherwise pitch-black dreams.

Realizing that it was her alarm, she turned again to hit snooze to find out that it was still blank.  She was slightly shocked that it was still beeping, but remembered the back-up battery in it that would still shoot off the alarm.  Hitting snooze, she went back to sleep, hoping for at least one dream.

<b>Unknown time...in between 5 AM and 7 AM</b>

Yet another rude awakening.  Kara had no idea what time it was and had no way of finding out, unless of course she wanted to go into her parent's room and jack their radio, but she was way too lazy to even get up.  She simply hit snooze and went back to sleep.

<b>8 AM</b>

Kara woke up to a knock on her room door.  Opening her eyes, she saw as her mother came in to inform her that it was 8:00 according to the radio.  It had originally been a two-hour delay today at school, meaning that she didn't really have to worry about getting ready until 8:30, but since power was out and she really didn't feel like getting up, she told her mom that she wasn't going to school today and closed her eyes again.

<b>10 minutes later</b>

Kara realized that she wasn't getting any more sleep tonight as the sunlight poured through her window so she got up, only to realize that the blister that had been hurting for a while now had popped...damn.  It was also in a very compromizing spot so she was in pain until she decided to get a band-aid on it with some bicatracin about 12 hours later...

But back to the moment, she limped out of bed and went to the living room, to discover that it was cold...very cold...  Grabbing the sleeping bac that was on the couch, she wrapped herself in it until she got out about ten minutes later to grab some cereal...the power was <i>still</i> out.

<b>Some unknown time later...around 10:30 AM</b>
Kara's stepdad wanted to go into town to figure out what had happened since they were essentially cut-off from the world.  Kara's mom agreed, as well as Kara's little brothers who wanted to go to town anyway.  Kara, who really didn't want to be stuck alone in a powerless place, decided to change and go with...  Especially after the revelation came that they had no water...

<b>Hardware Store...appx. 11 AM</b>
Kara walked in, listening to her CD player and following her parents into the camping section to pick up a camp stove and other entertaining items to live through the day.  Kara looked in the paper & supplies section to look for some new binders for school, soon migrating to the puzzles isle where she wanted a new puzzle to put together if they were really to live through the day without power.

She didn't get anything, Kara realized as she followed her mom into the checkout lane, her brothers holding their new handcuff sets, her stepdad a new stove, and her mom...what did her mom get?

<b>Safeway, appx. 11:20 AM</b>
Kara followed her stepdad in, heading to the bakery before taking an imediate turn into the magazine isle to check if the new issue of Anime Insider came in or not...apparently not.

Finding at least five people from her school, she wondered briefly if there had ultimately ended up being no school or if everyone ended up cutting classes.

She got four packages of Top Ramen, and a 6-pack of Mac & Cheese...yum...  

<b>Propane shop...12:02 PM</b>

Kara talked with her mom, wondering if Murphy's law would play out and their power would be back on as soon as they got back from getting all these provisions.  A camp stove, 24-pack of bottled water, and various non-perishable snacks later, soon to be joined by a full propane tank, they drove home, judging by other homes whether or not they had power.

<b>Home 12:20PM Appx.</b>
No power, but they had phone lines.  Keep all phones on chargers and build up the fire, that's all that needed to be done.

Pleading boredom and the inability to get much sleep last night, Kara slumped to her room and collapsed onto her bed with shoes on, falling asleep for about three hours.

<b>Kara's Room  Appx. 2:50PM</b>
Kara woke to her brothers screaming ""We got power!""  Hearing the obvious sounds of the light switch in the hallway being flipped on and off, she grumbled, turning over and hoping that the light wasn't burnt out again.

Only to be awoken to her mother coming into her room and flicking the switch on and off...

""What the hell?  Do you want to burn out my light or something?"" She growled.  ""I know we have power no thanks to brothers yelling it out there!  Get out!""

We all know how grumpy Kara is when she is rudely awakened...

<b>In front of computer 5PM</b>

""So, Hubanuba, did there end up being any school today?""  She asked when her friend answered the phone.

""No.  Trees fell and the school lost power.""

""Darn!  Now we have TWO days at the end of the year we have to make up!""  Kara exclaimed, referring to the snow day they received in late November.

""Yeah, tell me about it...""

And so Kara and Hubanuba talked for about a half hour before the phone lost battery...  And that's all I shall say in the Adventures of Kara, pt 1...

Okay, well, today has been, among other things, stormy, wet, windy, and stupid...  However, the windy and stormy aspects were so bad that the concert originally scheduled for today was postponed for sometime next week!  YAY!!!  I don't have to miss the Seahawks game tonight!

Okay, there are also many other things to consider about today.  For instance, tomorrow is a two-hour delay, meaning I don't have to go to school until 9:00...WOOT!!!

Anyway, I have immaturity chasing me around wherever I go, I guess that I can be happy that this term is almost done.  I have about 5 weeks left until I get to switch classes...

Anyway, I got my major essay for PNW turned in early so I don't have to worry about that and I can just spend 4th period on the computer...

I also got my current grades on Wednesday--all A's as usual... so I decided to make up a list of ""If you know me...""s...  It gets dramatic which I never usually am, so this melodramatic crapola is behind the cut.

<lj-cut text=""If You Know Me..."">This list will get pretty comprehensive, but is pretty short now, so I'll be adding to it later...

If you know me...

...You'd know why I will never willingly show my parents my grades...even though they're all A's

...You'd know that of the five people I've met that I feel I can trust with my life, only two are in this state...and only one of them is a ""guardian"" of me...(I am guardian of myself, damn it!)

...You'd know why I can't stand immaturity

...You'd know why my facade is no longer a facade, as the only time I can take it down is when I sleep

...You'd know why I strive for anonymity

...You'd know why I write fantasy, but can't stand realistic fiction</lj-cut>

Well, power's about to go out, so I'd better cut this short...

Ta ta

PS: Oh, yeah, something that I have to mention; Hugh Laurie got the Golden Globe nomination!!!!!  WOOHOO!!!!!"

I'm also planning to situate a ""Song of the Month"" or ""Poem of the Month"" to gain inspiration by and to get off my excessive writer's block...  I really don't know whether I want to do this before the new term, because starting late January, I'll be in new classes and only two of them are likely to have excessive homework: Chemistry and Sci-Fi.  My other two: Band and A+, are not really homework centered, unless you consider practicing an instrument to be homework...

The other unfortunate fact is that I feel that I should be writing now, but I have a tidbit of that hesitant 'I want to write, but I also don't want to write' mood about me...  I have a chapter of 'Parting' that I should be getting to my online editor, but I need a realistic disease to get my antagonist into the hospital with...  I might have it already, but I've also been reluctant to do any research on the subject...

Another problem relating to the writer's block is that I have too many ideas for stories that are just running through my brain right now...  There's 'Parting', another that I just got the urge to do called 'The Wolfe Effect', and another House story that takes place in Nazi Germany...that one I'm least willing to write, given the considerations that I think I know where it will go...and I'm not telling any of you either...

I also have my original series that I really need to work on, before next year...  A four-part series that I just can't seem to take on the plot line to.  I have the first part planned out, but I have no idea what I should do for details...  First part's going to be mostly angst, and I can't write that well, I <u>know</u> that...

As if that's not enough, I've been spending hours trying to tweak my journal layout to get it the way I want it, and I still want to change it...  I just am not satisfied...  I guess that's the perfectionist in me...  

I <i>still</i> have that lecture that I have to do on Nazi Germany.  Mr. J postponed it until today and today ended up being a snow day so I have extra time to write notes on that...  Since I have some homework I have to do as well, and some practicing, I guess I should go and possibly do that...  I still need to do some research on my multi-parter...

For starters, I have a stinkin' essay due on Monday as well as a lecture on Nazi Germany, and an enrichment extra credit assignment, and that's only one class!  Well, I guess it's okay considering that I don't have nothing else due in any other classes...

Also, I got new music in band for the winter concert that I feel like posting an analysis to, because I can...  I just got back from Coeur 'd Alene for a Thanksgiving trip to grandparent's house...  I also got a bit better at pool along the way...

As for the music, the first piece I have recently from the evil Ditz Dictator/Director is called 'Simple Gifts' and it was composed by Frank Ticheli...the guy that I find to be good because one, he did the arrangement of 'Amazing Grace' that I played last year for the Arts Night Concert(I had a solo, get that!), and two, he composed 'Vesuvius', one of my favorite pieces of music ever...

Considering my past experiences with this guy's music, this piece seems to be pretty easy at first glance.  3 out of 4 movements are mostly in cut time, so that simplicity may be short lived.  Still though, I think my hardest part is this little bit I have in the middle of the fourth movement that looks soli-ish at about 80 BPM Cut time...  Mostly quarter notes, but there are a few dotted quarter-eighth rhythms that look interesting...  My play time is also favorable...there must be over 200 total measures and I only have at the most, 20-30 of them resting...scratch that, 30-40...  I don't mind it...  The Range here is  mid Bb to the D an octave and 2 higher  There's also a combined F Horn part so I don't have to complain about being given second Horn even though I should be first seat... 

Next we go onto the 'Four Winds Overture' by Robert Sheldon...  It looks VERY easy at an overall glance and I think that simplicity will stay considering that the only two time signatures are common time and 3/4...  It is also a combined F Horn part, and my hardest rhythm is probably my repeat eighth-quarter-eighth-eighth-eighth-dotted eighth-sixteenth...  The range is mid C to F above T.Clef Staff so I'm not really complaining...

Music Rant over...

Anyway, in other news, I have a very easy week coming on, which is very fortunate considering that my entire sleep pattern has been thrown off because of my late night stay-up on Monday in order to watch Hugh Laurie on Leno...It was kind of funny and I guess that I'm happy that I recorded it...  of course, the next day was House, so I think I'm happy...

Anyway, I have to thank whatever higher powers that be that I have no school Friday...that will be a welcome relief...  The only problem that remains for tomorrow is, the Veteran's Day assembly...  I can't really stand the band during Pep Assemblies and this is more of a concert setting so I wonder how they will fare, especially since about 80% of the band are Freshmen...

Anyway, I have resolved to keep this short in the sake of time, so I have decided to cut this off here and continue on with my review...  Enjoy, that is, if you're a video game hound, like I am...There are no spoilers...that I know of anyway...

<lj-cut text=""Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus"">All right folks.  Take Final Fantasy VII, turn it into a third-person shooter with Vincent Valentine as the main character, add in a ""Devil May Cry""-ish storyline, and you'll have the much awaited spinoff, ""Dirge of Cerberus"" for the PS2.  This isn't that bad as a game actually...but that's coming from someone deprived of anything new for about a month and a half.

It's been three years since the events of the original FFVII, Midgar is gone, and Vincent is basically on his own.  Everything is overall peaceful in the town of Kalm.  That is, until a new foe shows up.

They are the Deepground, Shinra's secret project hidden for years.  They are experiments gone wrong, humans fed with a continuous stream of mako, and led by the five elite Tsviets: Azul the Cerulean, Shelke the Transparent, Rosso the Crimson, Nero the Sable, and Weiss the Immaculate.  You play (so obviously) as Vincent, trying to stop their plan to drain the planet of its Lifestream by awakening Omega.

Overall, this game is quite entertaining if you have a PS2 lying around and Final Fantasy on the brain.  Having a happy trigger finger and some accurate sharpshooting is advised but not exactly required.  You could just beat your opponents into oblivion.  You're equipped with three classes of guns: a handgun, a rifle, and a machine gun.  You can upgrade your guns for gil as well as buy items and other accessories.  This is a different--and possibly welcome--approach from a Final Fantasy game and I suggest at least checking it out, especially if you remember playing FFVII and wanting to know more about our favorite Valentine...no pun intended...

<b>Graphics: 9/10</b>
If you've played either Final Fantasy X or X-2, these graphics are nothing new, even though they are touched up a bit.  The beginning sequences are beautiful and there are those few FMVs in the game that have exceptional graphics...even the regular play has really good graphics, compared to some other games I've seen recently...which haven't been that much...

<b>Sound: 8/10</b>
I'll have to admit, the voice acting might be a bit monotonous, especially with some characters, but it's Final Fantasy...  The saving graces of this game's sound though, are the theme songs, both by Gackt...  I was listening to the music and loving it toward the end...  Other than that, I don't usually pay that much attention to the sound...

<b>Gameplay: 9/10</b>
This game, though not really long (my finish time was about 10 hours on normal) is very fun in my opinion.  You can use a sniper scope to take out enemies ahead of time and the things you can do are pretty fun...

<b>Controls: 9.5/10</b> 
The controls are easy to get a hold of and aren't really confusing or finger-twisting at all.  The trigger, as well as the aiming button is R1, instead of X or O like I see in a lot of shooters(inexperienced PS2 shooter game girl speaking here, what do I know?) so it's easy to control.  The d-pad is rarely used, except for shortcut items and a shortcut map which isn't really needed.  The opposite button pad isn't really used either, unless you're a melee junkie and feel like pounding on those enemies that are close to you.  The shoulder buttons and analog are your friends here...

<b>Overall: 8.5/10</b> 
This game is fun, but it loses a bit because of the short length.  The chapter setup and the end-of-stage add-ups are a lot like ""Devil May Cry""'s setup and I found that pretty easy to understand.  I easily reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys Final Fantasy but might be getting a bit tired of the standard TBB(Turn-Based Battles) that we're all used to seeing.

<b>NOTE: This is actually my first time really reviewing a game and I'm quite inexperienced at it...  I'm doing this because I enjoyed playing the game and for no other reason.  ""Dirge of Cerberus"" is of course owned by Square Enix...bladi bladi blah...all that usual disclaimer stuff...alright...I'm finished...Thanks for reading!</b></lj-cut>

"event","Ugh...  My morphing sponge of a friend is going to have a field day with that one...  As it turns out, my weekend wasn't the worst of things that could possibly happen, so I guess that it was okay...

On Saturday, I went to the SuperMart Wal-Mart that was about an hour away to check it out and found it to be a very stupid excuse for a Wal-Mart...  Their CD section was even less organized than the other WalMart that I usually go to...  I couldn't find any of the CD's that I wanted.

Well, as soon as we got back into town, we went to Blockbuster and I finally got my hands on Dirge of Cerberus, the FFVII spinoff with Vincent Valentine as the main character...  Expect a proper review as soon as I finish, which shouldn't take too long now...  I'm about 85% finished with it.

Anyway, considering that Sunday is usually football day, I wasn't all that excited...  My team doesn't play until tomorrow...hopefully they'll win too...  But I have to admit, that Miami win against Chicago was probably the game that I should've seen, instead of that idiotic KC game...

Anyway, I have another story in the workings right now... a complete...I dunno what you'd call it...Parody?  Maybe one of those Crackfic drabbles that I see all over the internet nowadays?  All I know is that it came to me suddenly as I was watching House and I laughed at the idea...

Speaking of House, I now have a seriously subtle inside joke between me and my friend that only a very few people would understand...I love inconspiciousness...(Is that even a word?)

Oh, Yeah!  I finally got at least <u>some</u> music for the Winter Concert in the workings!  My Director(I really don't like him that much...) Finally gave me two pieces...  ""Themes from Nutcracker"" by Tchaikovsky and ""A Vaughan Williams Cristmas""...  I was happy for the moment, but when I finally got the ability to take a look at them, I was severly dissapointed.  For one, the Tchaikovsky piece, for all its glory, is an <i>extremely</i> easy arrangement and I find it a complete embarassment to my current skills.  

You see, I'll admit that for my current place(F. Horn), I have to be used to playing minor harmonic parts(because my Director has absolutely <i>no</i> confidence in my skills at all[and because I'm the only Horn, besides the freshman horn])but I took a look at the flute part for ""Nutcracker"" and <i>that</i> looks mildly easy, for a flute part anyway.  My rhythms are elementary(the hardest thing is probably the triplet-onbeat eigth note setup that I have) and the range is practically nonexistent(D above mid-C to High Eb[top space in treble clef]).  I have too many multiple-measure rests for my liking(longest being an 11 measure in 3/4) and way too many held notes...  The funnest part for me is the ""March"" and I hate it...  I'd currently kill for a good part in the ""Russian Dance"" but no...the toughest thing I have is a quarter, eighth eighth, quarter quarter note thing in cut time...

Anyway, on to the Vaughan Williams piece...  I guess this is a <i>bit</i> more difficult, in a micrometer-barely-there sort of way...  I have to give the props of introducing the 9/8 time that I've never been exposed to before...even if I have a measure rest for all but one measure of that time...and in the measure that I do play something, it's a held note...  The range is still nonexistent(mid-C to second-to-top D on treble clef[barely an octave]) and rhythms are only a little more difficult(I think the hardest thing I have is the six sixteenth notes in 6/8, and that is also supposed to be slow...)  I guess I can be happy with the fact that there are only four measures in the 109-measure piece that I don't play...  The only thing that kind of irked me(besides the obvious) was the fact that I got second horn when I'm used to playing first...I can only hope that that freshman is good with her horn...or else I might suggest a trade...well, considering that I'm not in the actual class this term, I can stop being arrogant in my playing ability when I haven't practiced in a while due to the piece of junk horn that my Director gave me to practice with.  The mouthpiece sucks and it is extremely hard to tune that horn...I want my Yamaha back!!!

Anyway, my music rant is over...hope you enjoyed it...

Anyway, I have a bit of homework that I still have to do and I should probably go do it...  I also have a game to beat, House to watch, more movies to watch, and songs to figure out how to sing(Mystery...)  Oh great, now I have a giggle fit coming on...

Well, I shall go and write, watch, and play...farewell..."

It's supposed to rain for about a week if not more so I'm a little POed at that.  I won't be able to go on the State Park field trip that was scheduled for Monday, but that's alright.

I'm probably going to spend about 90% of my weekend in my room, either watching 'A Bit of Fry & Laurie' or watching House...  I finally got my hands on Hugh Laurie's 'Mystery'...I love that song...It is entirely hilarious...

Anyway, as another plus, my workload isn't all that big this weekend, either, which leaves room for watching all the stuff I want, and writing as well...All I have is a persuasive paragraph for World History...I wouldn't say it's all that huge...

I also had to do a bunch of stuff today in PE that my knee didn't agree with at all...First was push-ups, but mostly everything I have to watch out for nowadays.  If I even touch sonething lightly to my knee, it hurts like the firey realms of hell so I gave the warning that anyone who touches it, dies...I'm not kidding...it still hurts...

I feel like writing...  Darn, I have writer's block...this freakin' sucks...

Anyway, since it is long overdue, I have my own little opinion of the recent episode of House...finally we get something after a flickin' month of baseball-loving pigs and their damn World Series...

<lj-cut text=""Here there be spoilers.  You've been warned..."">Well, since I knew a whole lot of spoilers, it didn't surprise me much, but in my opinion, the previews that Fox has been airing revealed way too much in the form of House getting arrested.  It'd be a real kicker if we hadn't known it from the start...

Anyway, I believe that this is one of the first episodes where I didn't really pay attention to the medical side of the show...I was too far in withdrawl from a month without, not to mention that it was kind of boring compared to what was going on otherwise.

This episode was also the debut of the Tritter Arc(according to my sources, about 6 episodes)with David Morse playing the part of the offensive bully.

It all started in the clinic, Tritter has the unfortunate luck of having House as a doctor and of course, House is House with the sarcasm and bitterness...

The part where Tritter trips House is both infuriating and seriously uncalled for...I was almost ready to reach through the screen and strangle him...

Anyway, Cuddy calls on him(meaning House) to apologize for whatever he did and of course, House refuses, so that leaves a tension between the two billy goats for the rest of their time together.

Meanwhile, House is thinking Wilson is out to get Mrs. Wilson numero quatro(number four for those who don't speak Spanish...)and mistakenly assumes that he's dating the new nurse in pediatrics...so of course, there's that bit between them for the entire episode.  Well as it turns out, Foreman is the one dating the ped nurse, so that I found to be utterly crazy...

Speaking of the Duckling Minions, it seems as if Chase is turning into Foreman(the fervent House-supporter), Foreman is turning into Cameron(the ethics hound), and Cameron is turning into a mini-House(seriously, the sarcasm?  ""Yeah, I'm hitting that, and it's <i>so</i> hot""  A bit much?)  

Anyway, the arrest was an infuriating scene to me, and not just because House gets arrested.  I'll be honest and say that if Fox hadn't been airing that for the past month, it would've hit a lot harder.

One, how in seven hells does Tritter manage to be in the  exact same area as House at that specific moment?  I find that chance highly unlikely...

Second, the drugs?  ""Under the influence of narcotics"" is simply diagnosed by dialeted pupils?  Ummm...HELLO!?!?!?!  Darkness causes our pupils to dialate in order to take in more light!  MORONIC FOOLS!!!!!!  I didn't see a woozy House, nor did I see a simple balance test... One episode and this Tritter idiot is already getting on my nerves...  Well, next week's episode should be great, at least I'm hoping...

Best Quote of the episode: I can only think of one that settles in my mind.  ""I'm getting that, and it's <i>so</i> hot...""  Cameron's sarcasm is a bit out of character for her...okay fine, it is WAY out of character, as in the next universe, but I'll deal...

Random piece of trivia: Tritter is an IDIOT!!!!  that arrest shouldn't have happened and House should sue for false imprisonment...I'm completely serious...</lj-cut>

Well, after the cool part of staying up for 24 hours straight and then sleeping for the generous amount of 4 hours, I awoke and decided to watch House some more!  You see, I received seasons 1 and 2 on DVD sometime last week and I decided to invite my friend over for a nonstop House marathon.  We were only able to do a 24-hour thing, but that was okay.  We made it entirely through season 1 and only made it through the 1st disc of S2.

Well, if we decide to fast-foward my life until about 5 that afternoon, my friend had to go home and was picked up by her dad.  You see, it was at the top of the driveway, which was a hill.  After she left, I decided to (stupidly) run down the hill in flimsy sandals which barely fit on my feet.  Needless to say, I tripped over my feet and stumbled for a few seconds.  I seriously thought that I had righted myself and was about ready to stop myself, but as it turns out, I wasn't balanced yet and I ended up stumbling a bit more until I eventually fell and scraped my knee and shin on the pavement.

It hurts and I can't even wrap it in anything...Damn.

Well, as to conclude the drama of the last post, it turns out that mike is alright and came away with a hairline fracture in his neck...nothing too serious considering what it could have been.  I didn't go to Homecoming, but I guess it was pretty fun from what I heard...three people that I know of got kicked out.

Anyway, starting in the first quarter, we were slaughtering them.  At the start of second quarter, I believe it was 21-7.  The halftime show, put on by the band, completely sucked because they were out of tune and I'm glad I didn't bring my stepdad along because he would've been wincing along with the rest of us...  At least the cheerleaders did mildly well.  I was able to see my former friends(now graduated) and I got to catch up a bit...

Anyway, one of my friends, Mike, who was also in running for Homecoming King, went down soon after the third quarter started(score now 35-13), and I was unbelieveably worried that something serious happened.  It took about 15 to 20 minutes to get him onto the stretcher and the announcer told us that he had to go to the hospital for clearance...  It didn't appear to be anything really serious after I finally got a glimpse of him, but I'll have to ask him about it on Monday.

After the game, they announced Homecoming King and Queen, of which my friend didn't win Queen, but Mike won King!!!  It was a rightful end to the night in my opinion...

Anyway, after that, I went home, watched House, and also watched a marathon of CSI:Miami that went on long into the night and caused me not to be able to get to sleep until about 2 in the morning...

Anyway, I guess I am pissed, happy, aggravated, and accomplished at the same time.  I guess I'll also tell you why now...

Okay, let's go with 'pissed' first.  I'm pissed, mostly because my Mom is a pessimist and I get really tired of it.  There are the ignorant morons at school, and there's also the fact that I was using the sash to my yukata(Japanese sort of pajamas...it's like a smaller kimono) as a ribbon for ""Blue and White"" day and I ended up losing it.  Now my yukata is sashless and I'm really mad that I lost it...

'Aggravated' next, hm?  Well, there is the fact that I feel like I can't get through to anyone because I'm just some 15 year-old girl...no one listens to me...  For crying out loud!  I'm more flickin' mature than any 15-year-old that I've ever met and I believe I should have my say in things without everyone interrupting me!  That may have sounded selfish, but I don't care as of now...excuse me.

Let's go with 'Happy' next.  Well, I'm happy about many things.  First of all, I have the first season of House on it's way to the library so I can check it out...  I have some serious ideas for the next two chapters of my House fanfiction work in progress, which I might post here when I finish it, I still haven't decided...

And finally, 'Accomplished'.  I had a McTakeover the other night for Knowledge Bowl and we ended up making $477!!!  I'm happy that it was so successful, even though my job was typically boring because I was only handing out orders at the front counter.  The lobby was half-finished...  The drive-through got the most business and I wanted to do that so bad...but the seniors got to it before I did...

Let's see...the events of last night were varied among other things...McTakeover night...  6-8 pm is how long it lasted, and I had a bunch of fun, and even got some free food out of the deal!  I got to see some people who I hadn't seen since last year(graduated former seniors) and got to make a few shout outs.  There was also a partially memorable event I guess I should write in here...

Alex(name changed for privacy issues), meaning my former crush, walked in suddenly.  I saw him in the doorway and I'm like: ""Oh, God"", turning and running a hand through my hair, trying not to have him notice me.  Why that was my first instinct, I have no idea.

Well, he came up to the counter, made his order, I said hi, he responded, and then my friend Hana(once again changed)walked in, I motioned her over to the counter.

""You could've warned me, you know!!""  I said to her in a hushed whisper, as Alex had been right behind her.  She shrugged to me(she had been outside holding signs)

""I tried, but apparently I didn't get in here in time.  Sorry.""  She responded...  I looked over her shoulder at him, making sure not to maintain eye contact for too long...paranoia.  I thought I was over him, but I guess not...

Well, I also saw some other really good friends(or so I'd like to think) there and I had a fun time...That's what's important.

Well, that I guess was the memorable event this week, so that excitment is over.  Tomorrow is the Homecoming Game, in which I'm sure that our team will kick PT's sorry little butt into next millenium!  Well, I should go and write to my heart's content...farewell..."

Oh, also I just got my little hands on ""The Gun Seller"", the first, and (so far) only novel by Hugh Laurie...  I read the first sentence and I was already hooked...  I finished the first chapter and found myself laughing in hilarity at the last sentence of the chapter as well...As soon as I finish it, I'll probably review it...

There are probably two things you can count on from me...House episode reviews...when I get to them, and the reviews of the books I like...I think...oh, and music that I end up playing, come next term when I'm actually in band...

Speaking of which, my band director (ditz alert!  DITZ ALERT!!!!) comes off as completely unprepared, because of the fact that by this time last year, we were already on the field in preparation for the Homecoming Game(next Friday, the 13th), while now, he doesn't even have the music picked out yet!  If he doesn't give me the music by Friday, I refuse to take part in it!  I refuse!  Besides, the horn he gave me is complete crap!  The mouthpiece doesn't fit me at all, and the valves are completely dry!  Does he not know how to even take care of a damn horn!?  They are delicate instruments, damn it!  I'm furious at this complete ignorance!

Speaking of Homecoming, I'm trying to figure out whether I want to go to the Homecoming dance or not...  It's the day after the Game, and I really don't know if I want to spend the 15$ to buy a stupid ticket or not...

In other news, I was able to change my term two schedule so now I'm in a really cool computer programming class to get my darn technology credit over and done with...I plan on taking Drama next year though...It might be fun...

As of today, I managed to finish Macbeth, which I've been trying to finish for downright ages...it's really interesting and yet, funny(ironic, cliche, whatever) how it ends, even though it's supposed to be a tragedy...  Now I'm starting on another Shakespeare play: Much Ado About Nothing, but only because I also got the movie from the library and it has Robert Sean Leonard in it...(Can you say CUTE!?!?!?!

My friend has let me borrow Stuart Little, and I must say, to anyone who is only used to seeing Hugh Laurie as House, watch that one for a real eye opener...it's just really strange to see an actor play a character that is so sarcastic and gruff, then see him play a character so...caring and...family-like...

Hehehe...I just saw part of the Inside the Actors Studio interview with Hugh Laurie and it is funny, to an extent...  Unfortunately, I couldn't see the whole thing because of idiotic internet not posting the entire thing, but I guess I have no choice but to wait for the rerun of it on Bravo...

"event","You have to admit, with me updating this usually so late, something at 6:30(PST, of course, time change accordingly...), it's awfully strange to be updating this early.  Especially considering that half of my daily life happens late at night.

Well, anyway, I have my House analysis from yesterday's episode, so that's cool.  I love this show...  The cut's at the end, so look for it.

My friend and I were mostly going crazy not about the actual episode, but the previews for the next one...  House's anctics are so silly...it's really funny...  

Ooohhh!  I get to completely skip third period tomorrow!!!!  I had to run the mile today and to tell the truth, my calves are hurting because of it.  I cannot squat for crap; my lower legs will not support my excessive weight...GAH!

All of my classes were easy, uneventful, and essentially boring.  My House Buddy Mrs. LR wasn't there first period so I couldn't rant about the latest episode to her...the next episode looks promising though...Ooohhhh...I can't wait!  Well, without further ado, here's my weekly House analysis.  This episode: 'Informed Consent'

<lj-cut text=""Here there be spoilers, tread carefully..."">This episode looked promising from the beginning.  The rat lab seemed to be a nice touch, bloody, albino rats...  I don't think PETA is going to like this one...of course, 'Humpty Dumpty'(2:3, I think) was bound to get the same reaction, so I'll just shut up and move on.

The guy collapsing was only to be expected.  My mom first thought that he was having a heart attack, but my first opinion(because I have no anatomical knowledge to save my life and I'm no doctor, either) was some kind of shock.  The rat chewing the lip was a nice touch...(cue title scene)

Yay!  Was the first thing I said as soon as House came on to the scene.  Cane's back!  House without his cane is just...not House...

Anyway, down to the clinic, because I can't really think of anything memorable until this scene.  Now, all of us fangirls were looking forward to this whole idea, but now that it came, I really can't say that it's really all that good...  I'll call her the sterotypical blonde: only thing going for her is her looks, completely dense, a mall rat(or seems to be), and her flirting was borderline...I can't think of the word, really.

Back to the Patient of the Week...a guy who actually <u>wants</u> to die...I'd call this interesting...  But the way House describes the events of his death in excrutiating detail is so...excellent!  The voice he did it in gave me goosebumps...really...

Also, is it just me or is Cameron's Sarcasm a lot more profound in season 3 so far?  ""Triple shots and wild sex, what else?""  That really doesn't sound like her...

Yay again!  Wilson has fufilled his weekly quota of 1 scene a week...  I wish he'd be in more than just that...  Have an episode basically centered around him for once...they did it for everyone else...  'Hunting' for Cameron, 'The Mistake' for Chase, 'Euphoria' for Foreman, and the 'Failure to Communicate'/'Need to Know' duology for Stacy(Thank God she's gone!)  'Three Stories', season 1's finalie was House's major episode, and 'Humpty Dumpty' was centered around Cuddy and her problems...  Why hasn't there been one for Wilson yet?  Sure, the divorce arc was well done, but we need more of him, MORE I tell you, MORE!!!!  (All of above episodes were in season 2 by the way, with the exception of 'Three Stories')

Back to the episode at hand.  The whole ethical ""Do we kill him or not?"" problem is okay, but not the best, considering it's tearing Cameron apart...  Speaking of which: she seems very angry lately and I'm not liking it.  Maybe House's ""Cuddy's pregnant"" theory should be turned to Cameron.  'Cause she's ten times more hormonal than Cuddy...

House's manipulation using the medical journal was priceless.  Cameron, though she didn't admit it, completely fell for it...  Her taking charge completely redeemed the episode and my (relatively low) opinion of her as well.

By the way, I'm not usually a medic jounkie, but did the whole ""Unsterile-House-in-OR"" scream out at you or was it just me?

The look on House's face in the second scene with the ""Sterotypical Blonde"" was priceless...absolutely priceless...

Now, to the end.  The anti-House motion of comforting Cameron was completely uncalled for, period.  That was really, not House and I was staring in shock as I realized that it was House's hand on her shoulder...  I hope all you House/Cam shippers were happy with that!  'Cause I wasn't!

Okays, it wasn't the best episode, but it's House so I got my fufillment for the week and beyond.  Time to wrap things up.

Most memorable quote: House--""Don't go toward the light!  You'll fall down and break your hip!""

Random fact: The ""Sterotypical Blonde""'s 18th birthday is Tuesday, March 19th, 2007.

Rating: 8.5 out of 10; The dying dilemma added a new hitch, but it could've been done without Cameron sulking the entire episode.  The guy turning out terminal at the end was also very cliche in my opinion.  Lack of Wilson and Cuddy also seriously took off some points...</lj-cut>

Let's start with school: as it turns out, my friend <i>was</i> serious about the possibility that I focused on last chapter and she re-wrote my story, basically cutting out my expert dialog that I worked so hard on...  ""Oh no!  The Devil has acended to the earth!  Run for your lives!!!""  Seriously...why'd she have to cut that out!  It was perfect!

First period started with a tour of our off-campus campus...meaning the wetlands...and I got to talk to Mrs. LR about my blatant obsession with House, Hugh Laurie, and the like...

Second Period was easy enough, nothing wrong...nothing right...

Lunch had me figure out that lj is banned from the district's database!  Damn it!  I could hack it, but I don't feel like getting expelled, just because I want my friend to read what I wrote.  Damn it all...

Third period completely sucked, and as if that wasn't enough, I have to run the mile tomorrow...happy times!...NOT!!!

Fourth period resulted me in getting a (basically) 99% on my first test...and a movie tomorrow...

House was on tonight, probably the only highlight of the day because of the fact that my Mom's being a complete bitch again and everyone else is too damn ignorant for their own damn good...

As for a super cool evaluation on the excellent episode, you'll have to wait until tomorrow when I have a clear mind and can replay the tape and catch everything...I'll have to have my trusty notepad nearby...

As for now...farewell...today wasn't nearly as shocking, but it's still life...The idea of even <i>possibly</i> meeting Hugh is running through my head, though I'm probably getting ahead of myself...

"event","Well, it was...this day was completely unplanned in every sense of the word.

Let's start all of this at the beginning.  I woke up: that's as beginning as it gets...  Okay fine, my morning wasn't that eventful at all, unless you count my general annoyance of the human race as eventful...  

Fine, let's have beginning mean when I got to school this morning.  That's general enough.  To my friend's pointed disapointment and disapproval, I hadn't finished the story I all but promised that I'd have by today.  She got my House tapes back to me and I was able to read the note that my first period teacher wrote to me on Friday...I hadn't noticed it before and I was just then able to read the ""Thank You"" card that she so gratefully wrote me...House Buddies Unite!

Other than that, first period was completely hellish...  I was grouped with probably the most obnoxious <i>children</i> in the entire <i>high school</i>, no, <i>sophomore</i> class...  As if that's not enough, I was still sick so I had a headache and a stuffy nose...

Second period was uneventful, except for the idea that I'm doing my usual ""Teacher's Pet"" routine that I do every term...I try to make friends with my teachers, don't blame me if I want to be on more friendlier terms with my teachers instead of judging them blatantly because I only see them as a teacher and not a person...

Lunch was uneventful except for maybe the possibility that I had written probably the best lines I had thought possible.  I always tell myself that I work well under pressure and I guess that this proves it.  I barely had gotten my finished parody to my friend before third period started and she even wrote about it in her daily class journal.

Third period was uneventful, boring, and even more hellish than I could imagine.  I sit next to the most obnoxious idiots ever to plague this earth...

Fourth period rocked because I was able to flaunt my knowledge in a ""Jeopardy-like"" game where I answered the huge majority of the questions and was able to get out of class five minutes early because of it.  

My friend took my (House/Staples) parody hostage to show(flaunt) it to her family, who thought it was hilarious (A phone call confirmed it) and I will probably get it back tomorrow with so many marks, I couldn't distinguish my story from the notes...  Tsuki-hana(nickname used for privacy, only she'll understand what I'm talking about when/if she reads this) and her ""Evil Editor's Pen of Doom"" do that.

At which point--when I get it back, that is--I will show it to my ""House Buddy"" First period teacher Mrs. LR...

Now for the unexpected part and the reason why you will not be seeing this post on the internet any time in the next few years...: She--and her dad--suggested that I sell it/send it in for a possible deal...with Staples...

Understand, if you will, the implications of that my friend is saying.  She is suggesting that I sell this idea for a possible (internet) commercial with Staples...I listened in shock at what she was saying.  I asked her if she was joking, to which she replied: ""No.""  I asked her again, harboring the same result, maybe with a few added, yet unimportant words.  I then sat down on my bed, running this idea through my head.

My writing is nothing special, really, it isn't.  Maybe those who read it will disagree with me, but I still say the same.  I am highly, and I mean <i><u>highly</u></i> self-conscious about anything I write and I read it over in my head, thinking it nothing at all, thinking it average; common; not unique...

My friend will more than likely tell you differently.  She says that I have a talent for it.  My teachers in the past have called me a dialogue expert.  This strokes my ego for the moment, but is never long term.

I think over the implications of what she says, probably not even reaching beneath the surface of possibilities.  My parents agree with her that it might be possible, they just tell me to be careful how I do it.  I tell Tsuki that I have to do some research before even considering the possibility of doing this...images run through my mind at the possibilities...

Here's where I will admit something.  I am one arrogant person, but even I know my boundaries.  I'm usually arrogant when it comes to my knowledge, something I know I'm right about...  One of my major phobias is the fear of the unknown.  This is an unknown to me, a variable that could mean anything.  This could turn out the way I'm thinking it could possibly could, or it could turn out completely wrong.

But the thought that recently ran through my head: ""What's the worst that can happen?""  The logical portion of my sub-conscious tells me ""Nothing.  The worst that can happen is that they reject it.  Nothing lost at all.""  The more creative side of my mind tells me that anything could go wrong.  I guess another fear of mine is fear of rejection...  I just really don't know what to do right now.  I have to sleep on this possibility and percolate it throughout my brain.  

I know I probably won't be getting any sleep tonight...

I'm going to go sit in silence and shock while I continue thinking this over.  Farewell...

Edit: Also, I thought I'd point this out.  dirtyfilthy, I have no idea who you are or what circumstances brought you to accepting me as your friend, but I have no idea who you are and therefore demand that you take me off your friends list immediately.  I will not lower myself as to admit that I have any acquaintance with you whatsoever; so, unless you can possibly prove to me that you know me--an idea that I find preposterous, considering you're across the world from me--take me off your friends list as of now.  Thank you in advance."

My younger twin brothers are being a pain in my butt, especially when they are so darn <i>loud!</i>  They were running around all day and screaming off the top of their heads...darn it all...I feel a headache coming on just from the thought of it...

As if that isn't enough, I have what seems to be an ingrown toenail and it's also driving me absolutely insane!  It hurts every time I press on it and I'm sick of it...no pun intended, please...

I got to study my precious poisons so I might be able to move along a couple stories by that fact alone...one of the characters is about to become the victim...hehehe...

As for everything else, I'm in 12th position to get season 1 of House from the library and 11th position to get the second season...I can't wait...I'll be holing myself in my room all day to watch and write up stories because of my easily stimulated creativity...

I have to go and do something that will erase my boredom for the moment...maybe write my House parody fic...I don't know, something...

Until next we meet, farewell..."

"event","Yes, folks, I have a damn cold....  I just figured that one out last night as i woke up at all hours and was downing throat lausages like candy...okay, fine, they might have been actual candy, but you get the point, don't you?

At the current moment, I'm trying desperately to find any means necessary to clearing out my nose, since the stupid decongestants don't seem to be working and ibuprofen aren't exactly for sinus infections...I'm coughing and I'm a general state of fatigue...what else is new?

The good news is, I actually got to do some writing today.  It was enough to finish chapter ten on my current fanfiction project: Parting is Such Sweet Sorrow, as well as make up plot points for further in the story to keep it moving.  I plan on making this a long one and I don't want to go back on that word...

I'm thinking of doing a prompt for the hwfest, but I'm not sure and as far as I know, I only have about two hours left to decide before the claims close.  I usually don't like my creativity forced, but some serious plot bunnies are forming and I just can't get rid of them...it drives me insane...

I spent most of the day talking to a friend of mine, who also happens to be my RL editor, and plotting to have a serious House-watching marathon as soon as I get both seasons on DVD out of the library...I'm obsessive about it, I know, but I'll never stop...as long as that show keeps airing, I will watch it.

Anyway, I'm feeling quite tired, as well as infuriatingly sick, so I'll leave you with a parting note, farewell..."

"event","Today started as hell and only got worse...

From the moment I woke up, I knew that it was going to be a bad day.  It started when I just couldn't wake up.  It was way too cold and I couldn't go any farther than my bed until about five thirty.  As soon as I could, I figured out that I had a bad sore throat and my nose was stuffed to oblivion.  I took some decongestants right before I left for the bus, and thankfully, they lasted all day.

My first period, Aquatic World, wasn't all that bad actually.  The fact that I get to leave campus for the class is probably an added bonus.  I had finally finished my homework the previous night and was marvelling over the dragon I drew all day...  Not to mention that my teacher had gotten my tape back to me, only for me to give it to my friend.

Second period was straight up hell because for one, I just couldn't stay awake, and I had to take notes on a movie.  As if that wasn't enough, I had to go to the bathroom extremely for the last 20 minutes of class and my teacher is the type not to let you leave class if there's only a half-hour left in the period.  At least I had managed to write more of my story through the period while everyone else wallowed in their own ignorance.

I know I'm going to be aching this weekend from third period.  It was weekly fitness test and I had to push myself really hard, doing more push-ups than I had actually thought possible.  I don't really mind the running, but everything else(especially the step-ups) can go to hell.  I think I did okay for going without two years of PE.  

Fourth period was probably most embarassing and only enhanced the reason why I hate working in groups.  No one can do a damn thing and I ended up having to organize everything!  As if that wasn't enough, I think we had gotten a bad grade for presentation because we completely forgot a subject that wasn't even covered in the book!  It was more infuriating than anything...

As for my personal life, I'm still working on a story and I'm about 2/3rds done with it.  It's kind of a parodic little fic crossing House with that Staples commercial and the Easy Button...  Only evil ideas can result from this chain of thought.

Anyway, House is on tonight, I'm excited, and I'm kinda watching Kill Bill out of the corner of my eye...  I have plots that I have to form in my head so until tomorrow, farewell..."

"event","Well, this is the first time I've really done this kind of thing, but I guess it'll come with time...  I don't usually express feelings, emotions, or the drabblings of my day, but I guess with the anonymity of the internet, no one will know anyway.

I will tell you all that my name isn't exactly Kara, but remember that anonymity I was talking about?  I'd like to keep that if you don't mind.  Of course, odds are, none of you would know who I am even if I did go out and introduce my physical self to you all...

Well, off to the goings on of my day...I guess I'll have to fill you all in on history as I go along then.

School had started sometime last week so I've been swamped knee-deep in homework since I started waking up at five in the morning...  Seriously, I don't know if they took some kind of class or anything, but the teachers must have grown heartless over the summer.  I'm not the type to complain about a little extra homework, but come on!  On the first day?

Well, the day after school started, I had figured out that my first period teacher was nearly as obsessed with the TV show: ""House"" as I was...  It's a record for me, I guess...  It usually takes me almost a week to figure that kind of thing out from one of my teachers.  I just had to lend her my recorded tape for the latest episode because she happened to miss it.  Hopefully she'll have it back to me by tomorrow...my friend still needs to borrow it because she missed the first 20 or so minutes of it.  I just seem to be the community recorder, don't I?

Speaking of House, has anyone actually heard the full version of the title song, ""Teardrop""?  It's really interesting...  I just borrowed the CD from the library and popped it into my CD player...ladi, dadi, da...

History, my second period was also the bearer of good news, I guess.  We ended up playing a game that earned me and the entire team I was on extra credit for the course just because we won by about three points...  It was half review and half quick-write...Yay for XC!

Really, the most important part of my day was the fact that I had actually gotten my horn back!!!  Now I'm happy!

Before you plot to throw me somewhere(coughpsychwardcough), let me explain a key point here.  I, am a musician.  I play a very complex, difficult and sophisticated instrument called the French horn(Horn in F to all those orchestra players out there).  This year, unfortunately, I had to drop band for the first term in order to organize my schedule correctly and I finally convinced my band director(a total ditz, mind you) to give me my horn back, since the freshman horn had her own.  It's kind of an inner war between me and him.  He wants me to play at all football games, but I can't do it...the only promises are the Homecoming game and the Winter Concert...he doesn't seem to realize that fact.

At the moment, I'm watching Rush Hour 2 out of the corner of my eye while wishing it were Friday so I could watch another episode of House, rerun or not.  Yes, I'm obsessed, get over that fact now or face the consequences.  I'll elaborate some other time...for now, farewell."

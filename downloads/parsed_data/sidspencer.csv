"event","so as many of you know, i've been working on a command-line itunes controller for mac and pc for a long time. basically, i used to ssh into my music machine, fire it up, and control itunes from the command-line instead of having to use vlc or something. the mac os x version hasn't changed in a while, but it's <a href=""http://greentextonblack.net/tools/macosx/tunage"">here</a>. it's a mashup of perl and applescript. 

more recently, i realized that my powershell version had vanished! so i've been writing a new one. so far i'm on version 0.15, and you can get it <a href=""http://greentextonblack.net/tools/powershell/tunage.ps1"">here</a>. play with it if you feel like it. really there are very few cases when you'd want to control itunes from the command-line, but hey, it's an option. :)

"event","when i first got an email from my mom with the title ""steve jobs"", my heart sank. i was sure that he'd finally died from his cancers. but no! long live the steve!! he's just stepped down as ceo from apple. now that's scary in and of itself, but not so scary as him dying on the job. i'm very happy that he'll stay on as chairman of the board, because you know that steve can't keep his hands off of projects. he'll still lend his reality distortion field to apple as much as he can. think of all the man's accomplished! and from the 1998 imac forward, it's been nothing less than revolutionary. 

tim cook's a good guy, and also came from next, so i'm happy to see him take the reigns. but it's still scary because, well, it's not steve. apple's been ""just"" a company before with pretty good products, like in the 90s. but has apple ever been as hot as it has been the past 13 years? the imac, the ipod, the itunes music and tv and movie store, the iphone, the ipad... and their stock has gone through the roof. they're actually the most profitable company right now. and that was all steve. can tim cook it up? 

apple also seems to be in a positioning war over the cloud. they have their new ""icloud"" (which seems useless), and so many different devices all converging on the traditional island of the pc. the next front is unclear to me. (though i disagree with taking the optical drive from the macmini.)

"event","so i've gotten back on the comics train, buying graphic novels by the bushel. i'm still a big fan of hero books, and of specific artists as well. For instance, the art for x-force vol 1 (the new x-force, not the cable one) just viscerally gets to me. when jimmy sticks a knife through a purifier's head, you feel it. i've also been reading x-factor (i love peter david), and new avengers (michael bendis can spin a nice yarn). it's weird, because i'm about 4 years behind on everything and trying to catch up. and stupid marvel -- they number their graphic novels for order, but then just leave it to the reader to discover when the continuity requires you to get one of their ""storyline"" graphic novels. oh well.

i've also been baffled by levi's. they drastically changed the fit of their 510s right when my old ones are getting holes in the crotch. what's up with that? do i need to change brands? (i'm a brand whore, as many appleites are). i got some 34x34s (what i wear usually), and couldn't even button the damn things. so i got some 36x34s, and could button them, but have elephant legs in them. it just seems so silly.

yet again i'm not going to the burn, but this year i don't think i really mind. i'll be in the hearts and minds of enough people who are going. and the depression probably has something to do with it. when i hit my upswing again (probably around the time of the burn) i'll probably be sad. so many friends, so much playtime.

the dog is doing alright. we've been trying to train him to go the whole day without going to the bathroom, but he just keeps pooping on the rug instead. our doggie daycare guy (he takes the dogs to dog parks and just lets them play for hours) is still gone, and we haven't been able to secure a dog walker. sometimes i can go home in the middle of the day, but the bus wait/ride is obnoxiously long. wanna come walk my dog? ;)

"event","and best-laid plans tend to fall apart sometimes. i'd studied hard all weekend for an interview today, took a shower (shocking!), got all dressed up, was on the phone with a recruiter, and then found out that it was cancelled because both the interviewers were out of the office. no word on when it'll be rescheduled, either. so i'm still trying everything in my box of magic to calm down from my pre-interview jitters. so far klonapin and smoking have just made me feel weird in a different way.

so, like, have you guys ever noticed that almost everyone on <a href=""http://okcupid.com"">okcupid</a> says that they're looking for ""new friends"" or ""activity partners""? well, i've been taking full advantage of that, just benignly instant messaging people and having conversations with them. it's been great! some people seem to get a little confused that i'm not actually trying to get in their pants, but most have been pretty receptive. i mean, what would you do if a nice guy imed you out of the blue about something you wrote in your profile, and never even tried to cyb4r you? would you get the point that he was nice? would you ignore him as boring? well, let me tell you folks, most of the cool kids do the former. just today i had coffee with my new friend s, and we talked about everything under the sun! it was great. i must admit, though, it's still a little weird to just make <b>friends</b> with hot girls. it sort of goes against a lot of my knee-jerk programming.

"event","i finally got paid yesterday! this is my first paycheck in about 5 months, so i'm pretty excited. most of it will go to my health insurance and the new apartment, but that still leaves me with a chunk o' change that i already have spent in my mind about 12 times over. there are all the things on my amazon wishlist (it's easy to find), a plethora of shirts at <a href=""http://store.startrek.com/categories/37-clothing"">startrek.com</a> (including the wonderful <a href=""http://store.startrek.com/products/83491-shut-up-wesley-t-shirt"">""shut up, wesley!""</a> one), a gaggle of shirts at <a href=""http://threadless.com"">threadless.com</a>, and then various other sundries like my height in boxes of clove cigarettes. i've been smoking more these days (see the all that), but oddly my couple of days of smoking marlboro reds has me getting cross with my djarum blacks for taking so damn much effort to smoke. but i ""love"" them. (again, thanks to a's mom for starting me smoking, and thanks to k for switching me to cloves and perpetuating it.)

but i got paid!!! and i get paid again on the 4th!! so happy -- so, so happy. the days of having only $5 in my wallet and pestering j for more money are over. now i just have to get a dorca card so i can keep riding that bus like a pro instead of just a n00b. 

also, i never posted to here about my <a href=""http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.aspx?prod=172705100&amp;ctlg=010_Guys&amp;cid=1013&amp;source=2"">AWESOME green day hoodie</a>! the first cool thing about it is that it only says ""green day"" in a little patch on the left sleeve -- my style. the second cool thing is that it's inside liner has screenprints of all of the green day cds (even the first two) on it! and the third cool thing? it has built-in wiring for an mp3 player, and a special little pocket, and earbuds on the end of the hoodie cords. how cool is that? you look kind of like an idiot putting your hoodie cords in your ears, but it's so functional that it outweighs the slight dork factor. i *love* it. it's a little short for me, too, but i'll stretch it once i finally wash it. (yes, i broke my ""wash before wearing rule"" for this one.)

what else is up? moving (yay! 2/5! be there or be not there!), the disagreement, making friends off okcupid, going to work every day at aw, being in love with my wonderful girlfriend -- yeah, that's about it. oh, i might be able to start paying off my credit cards again, which would be nice. no bankruptcy for me if i can help it.

in other news, i was introduced to this australian band called airbourne which sounds *exactly* like fellow australians ac/dc. they're awesome! and the best part is that e likes them possibly even more than i do -- yet another reason why my gf is totally a win. she likes sweet water, too, which is something i haven't experienced with a girlfriend for years.
and do you have an iphone and want to get your smses off? impossible, i know, except not anymore! <a href=""http://www.digidna.net/"">digidna</a> has this product called ""diskaid"" which can take a lot of things off of an iphone or ipod, including smses! i used it when i sold my old iphone so i can keep them all for posterity. their other products are pretty useful, too. it's nice -- you used to have to jailbreak to do all these sorts of things, but their products just work. 
i've had four phone interviews in the past two business days, and they went ok. none of them matched the job descriptions that my recruiter sent me which was a total fail, especially the job at amazon whose description was for a client-side job (yay!) but actually was for a back-end c++ job (fail). so i had to pull all this c++ knowledge out of thin air without any studying of the language for months. it was obnoxious. two of the companies have really useful products, though, and we know how much i appreciate usefulness. we'll see. we'll see...
how much more can i ramble?!?!? i guess i'll stop. time to drive e to work. (yes, boys, i'm such a good boyfriend that i drive my gf to work, pick her up after work, go get her coffee and croissants, and take out her garbage and recycling.)

""this gun's for hire, even if we're just dancing in the dark"" could be taken as ""hey, i'm up for anything!"" or ""i'm settling for dancing in the dark, even though my secret fires burn for more"". so i'm melancholy. and i have a writer's block.

everybody goes to burningman tomorrow, so i won't know what to do with myself for a week. maybe i won't shower in solidarity, and melt a little gi joe. in the meantime, it's been crazy because g has been in town and e has been scrambling for her brc preparations. the karaoke last night was *fun*. it was pretty empty, but felt more full because we took over a whole corner with our group of 9+2 people. (the plus two were a sweet girl named courtney and her ups scrawny-yet-muscled boyfriend, who had me and e go up there and sing lady gaga with her because she was scared to do it alone. she approached erin apparently, and erin offered up me, and her boyfriend was all, ""bruce springsteen?!?!"" because apparently people really liked my version of ""dancing in the dark"" last night, even though i did lose my glasses partway through. this parenthetical has become most of the paragraph!) but i smoked too much. i made friends with this guy who was a poker player named mike. he was telling me about different gambling houses, and talking about sid vicious, and... who was incredibly excited when i gave him a clove. i like clove cigarettes -- they make me new friends.

now i'm listening to 2000-vintage mxpx. yes, ""the ever passing moment"". and i gotta say, it sounds better now than it used to. but i think that's because i can groove more on slower moments than i used to. see? i have a writer's block! look at the drivel i'm spouting.

No No No. they totally gave me this cup with wings that sat on the edge of the toilet seat, so it caught all of it. then, i had to use this little popsicle stick to spoon my poo into these vials pre-filled with chemicals, and then put the rest into this margarine container. even though i didn't get any anywhere, my whole bathroom smelled exactly like shit. it was ridiculous! anyway, then i got to take the cipro. i felt good for about two hours, and then the cipro bathroom attacks started.

"event","it was about time for me to pay my apple tax, as you careful readers will know. the time to pay the apple tax is a personal thing, a bit like the pon far but much less predictable. so, i bought an ipad 3g!!! this way i can pay at&amp;t even more money!!.... but for serious, then it feels more like star trek when you can access the internet from anywhere civilized, and even faster in most places. anyway, but now comes the wait! they freaked me out by debiting my account way before they shipped it (they still haven't shipped it), but i didn't know that, and was at an atm and about had a heart attack, because i thought they hadn't charged me and i'd just gone on some spending binge i didn't remember! so i sold stock, i prayed for my tax return to come early, and now everything's just magically ok, plus i have the tax return money again.

did i say that i'm going to puerta vallarta with e? it's for a wedding, should be neat. i think i'm going to try to just take my ipad, and see if i can do it."

"event","last night i dreamt that i had an alternate birthday party. my mom was totally there, again, mingling like a little social butterfly. the 520 bridge had turned into a ferry (the ends of the bridge folded upwards, and then it made like a boat), and there were people on both sides of the water, as well as on the ""boat"". reg and i went to the ""bcc dorms"" and accidentally fell down an embankment in his old car, so we opened up an open door on one of the dorms and waited inside for the tow truck. inside there was a bunch of trash, and... a blue and yellow snake!!!! the snake attacked reg, but he had a knife and cut the thing to death, all while i watched in horror unable to do anything. he was fine, but that was the high drama of the dream. that's all! still feels weird to be 30."

"event","steve jobs somehow got ahold of my soul many, many years back and i've been an amateur apple evangelist/apologist ever since. one of the things i often talked away was the concept of the apple premium. in years past, i was quite successful because apple hardware was usually pretty superior to what you might get from, say, dell if decked out exactly the same way. but now, it doesn't seem like it. take for instance the <a href=""http://www.jr.com/asus/pe/ASU_G51JXA1/"">asus g51jx-a1</a>. it's a pretty bitchin' machine, with tons of ports (esata, expresscard, hdmi...) and its only weakness being its middlin resolution. it's about $1450 depending on where you look. but for a comparable <a href=""http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs.html"">macbook pro</a> you have a lot less in the form of ports (only 2 usb, no esata, no expresscard, adapter needed for dvi or hdmi...), half the video ram, and it costs at least $700 more ($1200 more if i customize it how i want it). so if i could make myself use windows, i could get two superior laptops for the same price as the macbook pro that i want. what the fuck is up with that?!? i know apple sometimes loses its mind, but have they been so focused on the ipad that they forgot about mobile users' needs? it's just boggling my mind, and pissing me off, because my laptop's starting to show its age and i'm in the market for another one. but having to use linux or windows? ick. ick ick ick."

also: whistler was awesome! the drive there was very harrowing (pouring rain, twisty highways with no streetlights), and i forgot half my pills, but i only had one spell of total bastardliness, and made a good impression on the folks we were up with. i also discovered that snowboarding totally makes me hurt and cranky, and yet manages to capture my imagination even still. anyone want to go up to snoqualmie or something sometime? i fall so much, i'll be done in 4 hours max.

also! last night i saw a version of trenchmouth play at the blarney stone, and despite not being my thing, it was pretty fun. i saw some good ol' peeps, and met some very nice smokers. also, my cold seems to be on the mend, so i'm crossing my fingers."

what i'm not stoked about are switching bosses. because all the understandings and spec signoffs that the old boss did suddenly means nothing. so i did a little demo today of some cmdlets (if you're not using powershell yet, you should) and got a bunch of comments that, i shit you not, all boiled down to, ""you followed the spec, didn't you?"". but since the spec was signed off by the old boss, i ended up looking like a retard because it's not what the new boss wants. way to make me want to quit even more.

in other, other news, i've had two requests to go to the movies and no idea what to see! (other than the new almodovar flick, and maybe ""the book of eli"") what movies are you guys stoked on?

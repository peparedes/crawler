Dishwalla 
Every little thing 

Let me in
to see you in the morning light
to get me on and all along the tears they come
see all come
I want you to believe in life
but I get the strangest feeling that you've gone away
will you find out who you are too late to change?
I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time
I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time 
some times

lift me up 
just lift me up don't make a sound
and let me hold you up before you hit the Ground
see all come
you say your all right
but I get the strangest feeling
that you've gone away- you've gone away
and will you find out who you are too late to change?

I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time
I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted
all the time 
some times

Don't give me up
don't give me up tonight
or soon nothing will be right at all
salvation 
will you find out who you are too late to change?

I wish I could be 
every little thing you wanted


Dishwalla 
Until I wake up

I rest my head 
Between the bed and sky 
Download my dread 
Disarm my mind, make it dry 

Nothing in motion, and I'm satisfied 
No disappointment, until I wake up 
Don't want to wake up 

Into clear space 
Vivid vision, see her shape 
At my bedside, beam up my mind please 

Foo Fighters
Learn to Fly


Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying (trying)
Make my way back home when I learn to fly
I think I'm done nursing the patience
It can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell all the angels that everything is alright. . .
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try and make this life my own


Jimmy Eat World
Work

If you only once would let me
Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's gonna happen tonight
Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

All I can say 
I shouldn't say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place
While we still have time

oh oh, oh oh oh
oh oh, oh oh oh

All the best DJs are saving
Their slowest song for last
When the dance is through
Its me and you
Come on would it really be so bad
The things we think might be the same
But I won't fight for more
Its just not me to wear it on my sleeve
Count on that for sure

All I can say
I shouldn't say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place 
While we still have time
You want to take a ride?
Get out of this place
While we still have time
Yeah - We still have time

oh oh (ahhhhhhhh)
oh oh (ahhhhhhhh)
oh oh (ahhhhhhhh)
oh oh (ahhhhhhhh)

Can't say I was never wrong
But some blame rests on you
Work and play they're never okay
To mix the way we do

All I can say 
I shouldn't say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place
While we still have time
You want to take a ride?
Get out of this place
While we still have time
We still have time

oh oh, oh oh oh
oh oh, oh

My sundown

I see it around me, I see it in everything.
I could be so much more than this.
I said my goodbye's this is my sundown.
I'm gonna be so much more than this.
With one hand high, you'll show them your progress.
You'll take your time, but no one cares.
No one cares.
I need you to show me the way from crazy.
I wanna be so much more than this.
With one hand high, you'll show them your progress.
You'll take your time, but no one cares.
With one hand high, you'll show them your progress.
You'll take your time, but no one cares.

Good Goodbye, lovely time
Good Goodbye, tinsel shine
Good Goodbye, I'll be fine
Good Goodbye, good goodnight."

"event","And you lay there,
waiting for the knife to fall
waiting for a time
hoping you can see it through again.

Just Breathe...
Just Live....
When will it end...
When is it going to get easy again....


By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon'.
where me and my true love were ever wont to gae
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.
Chorus:
O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak the low road,
An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye;
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.
'Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomon',
Where in purple hue the Hieland hills we view,
An' the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.
(chorus)
The wee birdies sing and the wild flow'rs spring,
And in sunshine the waters are sleepin';
But the broken heart it kens nae second spring,
Tho' the waefu' may cease frae their greetin'
(chorus)



Lomon' is short for Lomond, it is probably spelled this way to allow

.
The song was apparantly written by a young soldier to his sweetheart. Two
of Bonnie Prince Charlies soldiers were captured in Carlisle after the
abortive rising of 1745. One wrote the song, the other was released and
took it back to Scotland to give to his colleagues sweetheart. The low
road refers to the soldiers impending death and the path of his spirit,
whilst the high road is either the sign of hope for which he sacrificed
his life, or the actual road back to Scotland over the high rugged hills.
Hence, his spirit would return via the low road and be back in Scotland
first."

For 4 years i've been running away from mainstream stuff like dances...and parties...i never imagined i would have fun because i found those things to be utterly embarrassing and pointless...Why would someone have fun at a dance when the danceing isn't even that good and half the time neither is the music. I was wrong...it was so much fun and i regret not going to them before this...now i won't have the chance ever again...I danced...those that know me know that I DON'T DANCE...But I did...thanks Vicki...lol...if she hadn't gone with me I probably wouldn't have danced and I probably would have been extremely miserable...but she made it fun...It WAS a night to remember and I am very happy I did go...I saw a lot of people there and realised how many people I actually knew...theres a lot of them...it's crazy....hmmmm....With all this going through my head I am going to give some advice...To any of you that read this...any of you younger kids....Have fun...don't be like me...don't think that it's immature to goto dances that it will be boring and don't be scared of dancing...you'll miss out... I swear it's fun just find someone your comfortable with and dance...who cares if you can't ...nobody else can and while you might feel awkward at first you'll stop caring cause you'll realise nobody cares if you can dance...what matters is that you have fun...enjoy your youth and live for the day...Theres no day but today...."

lingering on the edge,
a dream like state,
half awake,
or half asleep,
are they real
is it my imagination
those monsters
leave me scared
hunched over
cowering
kicking
hiding in a corner
screaming to get away
razor sharp,
fine cuts,
blood flowing 
my life drains away
i watch on
feeling every slice
every searing pain
the wounds heal instantly
only to be cut even deeper
the pool of blood 
flowing across the floor
my vision clouding
my senses numb
my body dying
as my heart beats

Time To Waste Lyrics



There's someone down below blowing you a kiss.
They watch from their windows
as all arms fall to their sides,
and all eyes fix on the death of tomorrow.
And you found everything you need
to make a life complete,
completely revolting and they have safety and relief
For sale down the street.
I see you in line every day

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry,
such a basket case, hide the cutlery.
I had time to kill, it's dead and buried.
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy.

These creatures are waking up in these dark trees.
Awaiting like vultures.
Eyes roll back turn white in time to feed
They salivate in hunger.
for you, and everything they need
to make a death complete,
completely unnatural and salvation lies
behind those dead eyes that watch you while you sleep every night, and

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry,
such a basket case, hide the cutlery.
I had time to kill, it's dead and buried.
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy.

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry,
such a basket case, hide the cutlery.
I had time to kill, it's dead and buried.
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy."

The Protector

You live your life with integrity, originality, vision, and creativity.
Independent and stubborn, you rarely stray from your vision - no matter what it is.
You are an excellent listener, with almost infinite patience.
You have complex, deep feelings, and you take great care to express them.

You would make a great photographer, alternative medicine guru, or teacher.</td></tr>

The Idealist

You are creative with a great imagination, living in your own inner world.
Open minded and accepting, you strive for harmony in your important relationships.
It takes a long time for people to get to know you. You are hesitant to let people get close.
But once you care for someone, you do everything you can to help them grow and develop.

You would make an excellent writer, psychologist, or artist.</td></tr>

The Scientist

You have a head for ideas - and you are good at improving systems.
Logical and strategic, you prefer for everything in your life to be organized.
You tend to be a bit skeptical. You're both critical of yourself and of others.
Independent and stubborn, you tend to only befriend those who are a lot like you.

You would make an excellent scientist, engineer, or programmer.</td></tr>

"event","- Once and for All Lyrics



Music by Alan Menken.
Lyrics by Jack Feldman.


DENTON:
This is the story you wanted to write
Well, tonight is the night that you can 

JACK:
Just get this done and by dawn's early light
You can finish the fight you began 

DAVID:
This time we're in it to stay 

SARAH:
Think about seizing the day 

JACK:
Think of that train
As she rolls into old Santa Fe
Tell 'em I'm on my way 

MORE NEWSIES:
See old man Pulitzer snug in his bed
He don't care if we're dead or alive
Three satin pillows are under his head
While we're beggin' for bread to survive
Joe, if you're still countin' sheep
Wake up and read 'em and weep
You got your thugs
With their sticks and their slugs
Yeah, but we got a promise to keep 

Once and for all
Something tells me the tide'll be turnin'
Once and for all
There's a fire inside me
That won't stop burnin'
Now that the choices are clear
Now that tomorrow is here
Watch how the mighty will fall
For once and for all 

MORE NEWSIES:
This is for kids shinin' shoes in the street
With no shoes on their feet every day
This is for guys sweatin' blood in the shops
While the bosses and cops look away
This is to even the score
This ain't just newsies no more
This ain't just kids with some pie in the sky
This is do it or die
This is war! 

Once and for all
We'll be there to defend one another
Once and for all
Every kid is our friend
Every friend a brother 

Five thousand fists in the sky
Five thousand reasons to try
We're goin' over the wall
Better to die than to crawl
Either we stand or we fall
For once
Once and for all





Hey everyone. I guess i am gonna post in here and make everything pretty simple and straight if anyone actually cares...I'm single i believe everyone knew that....I'm kinda/ kinda not looking for another relationship right now it all depends on the person....Anyways that's the one thing i'm not gonna write about cause i'm not ready to yet...Still sorting things out i guess. The show is over... I miss it, i miss having a reason for being there all day long, i miss talking to people certain persons in particular... I made some knew friends this show and strengthened one friendship which i'm very glad about and yeah i'll post more on that later maybe...This show was difficult...it was. There are only two things i can really think about one is well yeah again, i'm not ready to talk about it yet...The other is the ghost light ceremony...This time was so different from the other shows i've done. At every other ghost lighting i have stayed for a really long time....i tried to force myself to cry in the past...i never could and i felt so....so wrong that i couldn't...But this time i stayed for maybe 5 minutes until i left because i was crying....i was and it was so ....different. When i handed Dixon that script i just could barely stand....And when she hugged me and said thank you i almost burst into tears there.......It was ...i don't know....i just don't know it was such a different experience and it scared me....it scared me to think that i have one show left....only one...I'm afraid....a few of you know what i want to do with my life....for those who don't i want to work at Disneyland as a lighting technician....It's a wierd goal but when you think about it...they are the best....you have to be the best to work there....so thats where i want to end up working for disney....kinda strange i know but it's true....and that's why i'm afraid... I'm realising how hard it's gonna be to get there all the work it will be but....it's my dream....I'm glad i did this show....i am. I'm glad i got to work with all of you .... I'm just getting really freaked out at the prospect that i won't be at liberty for much longer... This is my last year as a student and i might be there for next year too i'm not sure. Life is strange ya know...one minute your a lowly freshmen and the next thing you know your up on stage in the dark praying for a little more time....Praying for a way to keep it all and not have to say goodbye to the friends i know i won't ever see again after June....For all you underclassmen don't start thinking about it yet...it'll only make you sad and you need to have fun still. you need to push those feelings away until your senior year so you don't feel the pain....it's funny you know...you think you aren't that attached to anyone or anyplace and then you realise your trapped and you like it...I want everyone to have fun this year....For some of us it isn't as fun anymore... some let it die....to some of you it may just be a hobby, others might think of it as a job....but to those few myself included....it's a calling.... What i'm trying to say is Theatre can make or break you...don't let it break you....love it and you'll be fine. Goodnight my friends."

<i>And she finally posts...</i>

Anyways, this last week of school has been really hectic. I just hope I get good grades again.

Friday I went to the movies with Miriam. I finally got to see the Butterfly Effect. Miriam hated it but I thought it was really cute (or whatever word works best) When I got home at midnight everyone was asleep. The frickin' door was locked and I had no key. Someone finally woke up about 20 minutes later to let me inside. lol.

Saturday and Sunday I was in Aiken. Nothing really happened those 2 days."

Last Friday I really, really wanted to go up to SHS, but that was shot to hell because of all this other crap that happened. Anyways, I ended up going to Atlanta with Miriam that night. (She had to go to this audition for a dance camp in Boston this summer) We had a lot of fun. We goofed off the whole time we were there...but hey, what's new? We got back Sunday afternoon. Needless to say I slept the rest of the day from lack of sleep.

...Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday were horrible. There was absolutely nothing to do, I couldn't go to SHS and I was terrfifyed to see what I made on my report card. (which I actually got really good grades. whoo hoo.) So for those 3 days nothing interesting happened.

Today was the first day back to school. (I get to take Italian) It was really fun because we didn't really do anything. I found out that Toni is in all but one of my classes. That should be really fun and distracting. I don't care. I'm gonna work my ass off this semester.

Happy late birthday Lois.



Much Nirvana love,

Last year when Toni and I became best friends we both went crazy. We got into A LOT of trouble (Rosa can vouch for me). It was really fun while it lasted, but I need to grow up. I need to stop all this crap that I am doing and get my life right. I realized this New Year's Eve.
I need to hang out with people like Miriam and Rosa. People who seem to know what they want from life. That shoulde be my resolution.

<b>New Year's Eve Party-</b> Kelli and Lois came over and we went over to Miriam's house. My family and her family went out to their lake house where we shot off fireworks and played with fire. Heehee... :D Miriam, Kelli, Lois and I talked outside in the freezing cold for about an hour. We got cold so we decided to sit in Miriam's car and listen to CD's. (Her car has seat warmers) Little did I know that there was a bottle of vanilla vodka underneath my chair. (It was Miriam's, not mine) So we all decided to bring in the new year with a little bit of alchohol. How could I refuse? Yes, I had fun. Kelli was the only one who threw-up. Miriam forgot most of what she did and Lois and I just chilled. the end."

Ok, today was a very dysfunctional day. Rosa and I went to Savannah so that we might scope out guys...I mean shop. When we got there we just wondered around aimlessly while getting run over by crazy shoppers. We went into this nature-all-over-the-place kind of store and there were some interesting things in there. They had this water fountain with a little bucket attached to it and when it would fill up with water it would spill. <b>I</b> thought that it was interesting but <b>ROSA</b> thought that she should pick at my because of my little blonde moment and harass me in front of everyone in the mall. Tsk Tsk Tsk. Anyways, we ate at a Chinese restaurant, even though there were Hispanic people working there who kept screaming ""Que pasa?"" at the people working in the back. On the way back home my mom was really tired and started to doze off. She started to go off into the ditch, but luckily she woke up in time. Haha. It was a really...interesting day.


Last night Holton and I went over to Miriam's. Ben and Dale came over...that made the night very weird. We rode Miriam's go-cart around and Ben almost flipped it. We met some of Miriams' friends from New York. They were really cool. The night was very interesting."

I've got to go to that stupid conference at the school today or maybe tomorrow. I don't know when.


I'm gonna go to Mill Creek later to visit some friends. Wow. The excitement is overwelming. .::sarcasm::."

"event","I went to the movies last night with Holton, Kelli, and Lois. Right before I left Toni called. She wanted to talk when I got there. We both apologized for everything. She also told me some things that I NEVER want to hear again.

Kristin and Felicia and Ben were there, also. They made the night really fun. The place was so crowded that we had to sit on the damn floor. We kept leaving and coming back and everyone there got really pissed. They started throwing food and me and Kelli.

Toni and I saw Harrison. We said hello. When we went up to him he didn't even ask about Lois. There's a first for everything.

<b>Highlights of the night</b>
1. Toni and I met tons more of potheads (not really a highlight, just an interesting fact)
2. We got to see Rosa march around in a dorky outfit.
3. Sonic food it great.
4. Tims was there.
5. All the preps looked at us like we were crazy for being there.

"event","Today was.....weird. Toni hugged me right when I saw her this morning and she told me that she didn't hate me. That made my day great.

Then I come home to find out that my mom got her money. We (our family and Dwyane's parents) went out to eat...that was great, also.

After that, we went to the mall because mom and Dwayne wanted to buy her engaegment ring. They bought it and yadda yadda yadda.


<b>MEANWHILE</B>, down at Hot Topic, Laura is getting kicked out. Yeah...that's right. I was thrown out of Hot Topic. I was a smartass to the manager *coughfatassbitchwithcheaplipringcough*. Dwayne was ready to bust a cap and Holton wanted to get ahold of some form of weapon so that they too could defend me. I got a kick out of it and the great thing is...I'M NOT BANNED! 

So you better watch out you fake-ass, wannabe punk, $7 bucks and hour manager who has a cheap ass lip ring because I didnt do shit to you.

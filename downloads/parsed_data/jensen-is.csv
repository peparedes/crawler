"event","Jensen is an Island boy, born and bred. He and his little brother Jared were born on the Lower Main, he went to school on the Upper Main... at least while there was a school. He saw The Island being built and being corrupted, and the day came when he was strong enough and angry enough to have a say about it.

He is a delivery boy by day and your local neighborhood super hero by night. He robs the rich and gives to the poor. He metes questionable justice with an even hand and he has no apparent qualms. He does not want yours and he does not let you take thy neighbor's. Unless you are rich, then you gotta share your apple pie. He has no superpowers but he is fit, quick on his feet, can hold his own in a street fight and knows the ins and outs of The Island.

He is capable of the deepest feelings and of the most shallow one-night stands. He rubs shoulders with luxury every day but he is piss poor. He thinks love is a myth but he dreams to be proven wrong. He has a guilty precious secret. He is both faces of the Island and essentially is an Island's child.

"event","I like it when dad visits us. 
Because it's fun.
And alcoholic.
And we shopshopshop. 
I swear he drains out every bit of energy that I have in me. 
Like today.

It was 4AM when I went to bed last night. 
Dad slept later than I did. 
This morning, he barged into my room excitedly,ready and set for the day, 
at 930freakingAM! 
I couldn't even open my eyes. 
Five hours of sleep - definitely NOT ENOUGH. 
I woke up at 1030AM later.
Only because class starts at 11. 
He tagged along to Uni. 
He explored the place while I was in class. 
After class, we went to FedSquare - Umbria Jazz and beer. 
And lunch at Chocolate Buddha. 
Assorted sashimi, nabeyaki udon.
After a couple of hours of music, we went shopping. 
Ian's graduation ceremony is tomorrow.
He needs a nice shirt that goes with his expensiveworthless tie. 
Ian being Ian, choosy and fussy. Not to mention his girlfriend. 
So we went to Melbourne Central.
Then Myer.
Then David Jones.
Then... urgh, 2 hours later, no shirt yet.
Dad bought one for himself instead. 
Then, we stopped by at KokoBlack for tea before heading to Crown.
Mmm. Belgium chocolate.
Crown - after a couple of shops, Ian found a decent shirt that he liked.
FINALLY.
Harrolds, off white, diagonal lines, single cuffed.
Expensiveworthless shirt and expensiveworthless tie. :\
Then, I got myself a pair of boots from Nine West. :)

We went to the casino since dad hasn't been in there before.
Even though he has been to Melbourne for godknows how many times.
He's not too much of a casino person I reckon.
He gave me $20 to play pokies though.
But they went down the drain as fast as waterfalls. :(
Me am no lucky.
Then we went to Southgate.
Irish pub - PJ O'Reileys.
Kilkenny and fries.
Then dinner at Blue Train.
Eat eat eat. Drink drink drink.

Shopping, alcohol and food.
See what I mean?
That's daddy's style.
And I like that style. >D
Superb combination.

It did not end there though.
After that he wanted to go to Docklands for drinks.
I was too tired so I went home.
But he went there anyways.
Now, I'm home, resting my poor legs and achy body.
And dad, he's still out.
Damn. He has too much energy.
And I thought he was an old man."

<P align=justify>Iqbal accused Parveen of having an affair. Parveen insisted that she had never been unfaithful to him, but Iqbal didn't listen. Instead, he gagged her, bound her feet and hands and hung her upside down from the ceiling. As he beat her with a wooden ax handle, blood began to drip from her arms and legs. Then Iqbal, a barber by profession, traded his ax for a razor. He cut off the lower lobes of her ears, then sliced her nose at the base. ""He next used a metal rod to poke out my eyes,"" she continues, ""and then put his finger inside each socket to make sure nothing was left."" When Iqbal finished mutilating her, he cut the rope, causing Parveen to fall to the floor like a limp rag doll ""He left me for dead,"" Parveen says, "" and then he took our daughter and left."" Parveen crawled across the floor, found a blanket, wrapped it around herself and passed out.</i></P>

"event","It's almost 3AM. I've been trying to sleep since 12. Fucking insomnia. It's killing me. I've tried sleeping sideways, mummy-style, lying on my chest (this would usually do it but it didn't this time), adjusting pillows/quilt/number of clothings, tried sleeping upside down.. but nothing helped. It's freaking annoying.

At times at such streams of thoughts would never stop flowing. One of them tonight was about my first watch. The first watch I ever had was a free gift from Pizza Hut. Couldn't remember how many large pizzas we had to eat before getting them, but Ian and I each had one. It was a Dick Tracy watch. Prolly when the movie came out. Yes, it was THAT long ago. 

It was a black watch. The straps were made out of cheap, thin PVC, and the watch buckle was coated in cheap glossy gold-coloured paint. Back then my tiny wrists were too tiny for the watch even if it was hooked to the last hole. So mom pierced another hole and it fitted perfectly after. Even though time was just another number then, it was SO cool to have a wrist band that has funny looking digits that ticks and changes. I don't know how long the excitement lasted, but it sure was fun. :)

I miss being 4 years old. I miss my childhood. I miss having funny thoughts about common sense which I could never comprehend. I used to think a lot about one particular matter. I'd always try to go in deep, but later to realise I'd easily loose my chain of thoughts. I abandoned this thought when I started growing up, when I started learning new things, (more IMPORTANT things, at least!) and thus it was left at the back of my head. 

UNTIL. The Matrix was out.

Whether the trilogy was true or not (umm, most likely not) it certainly answered A LOT of questions about my little thought. And that little thought was.

If our body (movements and such) is controlled by our brains (ie mind), what/who controls our mind?

Nope. I'm not complicated at all."

When people scream out out of their lungs ""get me outta here!""
When people seek for changes.
For better or for worse.
A month to reflect and realise.
It's time to shift.
It's time to move on.
It's time to improve.

This applies to everyone.
It will overwhelm you.

"event","ohh goodness, how everything in my life in the past year has just been turned upsidedown and if not for anything else, it has been a great test of paitents and strength. 
in the end of it all, my knee is fine, life does go on when your heart is broken and then i learned how strong i really am and how many amazing friends i really do have in spite of how often or how little i get to see them or whathave you.
im growing up faster than i realize and lord is it scary some days.

thank goodness for the good days and those to come in the next year."

"event","OKAY, so i highly doubt that anyone ever reads this, but i dont blame you.

anyway, ive changed my major for and im home for the summer from college and looking for a job. hopefully i'll hear from a couple of places monday or tuesday.

in addition, umm, ive got myspace account under rock the arts yo (seriously, thats what it is lol). my arieschaos05 xanga site has been long gone. i trashed it cause i was tired of people reading what was going on in my life without even talking to me and just asking me about it first. so with that, i started brassbabe05 on xanga which is up and running.

um sooo thats about it i guess? i'll keep up on LJ for the sake of people who might actually read it."

"event","well lets see, havent actually written anything worth writing about in a while in a few days. so last week i hung out with ben who goes to BG (woot!) which was random and nifty cause all we really did was wander around town talking.

saturday: i worked 2 parties. the first i got tiped $10.00 which was bitch'n, and then the second party,  a kid puked on the floor....that was just a bitch. oh well.

sunday: so yeah, i called off work to go see DCI which was unessesary because i could have worked cause it didnt start til 3pm. so goooo me!! i screwed myself out of 3.5 hrs of work. oh well, it happens. i'll make up for it next weekend.

today: i wake up to the sound of the phone and i figure its henry but cause it woke me up, i wasnt in a hurry to pick it up. well when i roll outta bed, i was right so i call him back. he says luke is gonna be over in like, an hour and im tired and confused and dont know whats going on except that im confused and that i should take a shower and get dressed. agh! well anyway, luke came with his gf, erica which was nifty cause we ended up getting along really well. so we went swimming, then to skyline, and of course, greaters after that. 

by then, henry had to get home to get ready for work, and i needed to practice anyway....i kind of stoped playing in the middle for no reason so i should get back to that hahaha oops..... 

so besides that my summer has been work, henry, chess, sleep, music (in no particular order)...thats a kick'n good time of 2 and a half months.

man, nick has been down and out of energy and just everything i think and it really pisses me off that someone could turn their back on someone who had so many feelings and someone who put so much energy into the relationship and end up...unjustified to say the least. damn... that makes me mad to see someone so close to me be so torn apart. i hate it. i hate it everytime a girl does that to him, but this time its different because hes got another part of his heart involved: Little D. i mean, God!! who in their right mind denys their child...CHILD!! the right to a healthy relationship with his father and mother?? i dont get it. maybe i feel a strongly about it cause of being been through divorce (even though its not quite the same)? but man... i could go on and on but i'll stop here for now. 

its 2am and im supposed to be up around 7am for lessons at 8am. 
...its amazing to see the kind of strength that people find from within to carry on in times of doubt..."

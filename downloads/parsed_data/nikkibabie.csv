"event","I wanna update but im not really sure where to start.My last semi personal entry was about a month and a half ago and even that one didn't really say much. What that poem meant was the break up between Tim and I...details not needed.....we gave it another try a few weeks lata but the feelings just weren't there anymore. No regrets, i loved the kid. He just went down hill real fast and is into some trouble right now which makes me kinda happy that we aren't together anymore. But that was like a month ago so enough of that. I still talk to his cousin Ronnie on a daily basis and we chill alot. Neither Tim or Ron work at wawa any more and im quiting as of saturday so anyone know any good job oppurtunities? I got my prom dress and a date,Waine,and prom is all planned out. My B-day is in less then two months and even though nothing will change I still can't wait to be legal. Beth and Serge are over wit and Allison and Frank never eally began so that whole cupid comment I made back on V-day was probably as wrong as it gets. Other then that everyone just seems to be doin their own thing. We all go our seperate was in 5 months which is really hard to believe. We're all gettin together to go to Abyss tomorrow night so that should be fun. So thats about all, if u wanna know anything else talk to me one on one...catcha next time."

The feel of the tears rolling down my cheek
The lack of emotion shown in ur eyes
The unwillingness to look into mine
The final good-byez of what i didn't want to end
The sorry excuses that were meaningless to me
The hrs of crying wasted on you 
The weeks of happiness I'd live all over again
The pain that sits deep inside
The scared feeling of what is to come
I was the only concrete thing in your life
Now I sit shattered never to be whole again."

Friday night nuttin really went down, I babysat for the bro so i was in all night. Sat was of course v-day. I worked 7-3, met Tim at 3 and came home to change and go out wit him for the day. Some how Allison winded up being wit us for the day. Didn't really make me thrilled but I guess it was okay. We went to see 50 first dates went to dinner at Nick the Greeks, hung out at Tony's for awhile and then pretty much partied the rest of the night. We exchanged allison for ronnie on the way there. We started off at this one party ova at Vinny's house but once the keg's were gone the party got pretty beat. Plus Hurley and Tim were getting a lil aggrevated @ the guyz hittin on me and Michelle so we all took off. We then went to Pams house cuz her brother Ron and his friend Rider were home from the army...MAD ALCOHOL! Everyone there was kewl as hell so the whole night was pretty chill. Tim drank way to much and winded up kissng the toilet for the last twenty minutes there until Ron and I decided we had to get him home since Tim and I were both suppose to be tucked away tightly in our beds, and it was now 5:30a.m.  Next morning I talked to him around 12 and drove him to work wit me at 3. I worked 3-6 and he worked 3-8. Mommy got a lil p.o'd that I was out all night the night b4, and thanx to tim, I have a gigantic hickey on my neck, so she didn't want me goin out. So i made up some story bout goin to a movie wit beth @ 8 and then crashing at her place. So i picked Tim up at 8 and we went and chilled at pams. Then made like a million trips everywhere waiting for a party to pick up. Tim and I both crashed at Pams last night so that was kewl. And i woke up ten this morning and was outa there @11 and home in time for mommmy not to suspect a thing. So basically my four day w/e consisted of alcohol, sex, and parties. Sounds like a good w/e to me."

Came back to ""the friends"" and chilled until Tim called my cell around 12 when he was finaly able to break outa jail. We went to one of his friends parties til like 2, drove some peeps home and chilled at the one girl, Pam's, house and drank some. Then we went wherever for some alone time and I dropped him abck off around 5. Then I went back to ""the friends"" house and crashed there till 10 this morning. Came home, showered and changed, and headed back out wit beth to the mall and lunch until around 3ish. Came home and now im babysitting the brat while the parentals are in A.C. Tim wants me to go to Vinny's again wit him tonight but wit my luck sneaking out would be impossible plus I have work tomorrow at 7a.m plus we were there last night and were gonna be there tomorrow night and Tim and i will be together for atleast 8hrs tomorrow so i think we can afford the night seperated.

We went on a couple of dates, u know pool, the movies, dinner, etc and i met the family. We've talked literally everyday for more then 3 weeks. We went out again last night and we decided to give it a try so we're together now. I didn't mention anything to anyone about him except for beth allison and Ry (those who i talked to daily) cuz i didn't wanna jinx it. Besides if i didn't tell them they would of picked up on it anyway cuz of how happy I've been latey.

"event","When i saw you New Years Eve i wanted to kiss you so bad but at that time i knew id see you later and i wanted to follow my plan. The plan to kiss YOU when the ball dropped and to have you be my new years resolution. I wanted you as my wish, someone to treat me good, someone to show me how to do right, and someone to be there for me. I wanted to kiss you that night and many nights after that. You were my promise to be honest and true and happy. You were my step foward, my decision to break down the walls I have wasted so much time building up. But when i went to the door u were suppose to be behind and opened it up u weren't there.  All I found was a black hole of loneliness that I am getting way to used to seeing. I have choices and I have possibilities, but I know by choosing u I'd be closing the door on the rest of my possibilities. I felt I was ready to do that, that i was ready to be with just you. Get me back to feeling that way, I need to feel that way, I need to feel that way towards you. Basically i just need YOU!.

This is my fairwell for awhile. I've found that this journal has been nothing but a cop out for way too long. All of you get to read about the most personal things that go on in my life- my tears, my laughter, my heartache, and happiness-but none of you have to deal with me. You never have to be there to support me, or comfort me, or congratulate me. You get to be a long distance friend without the actual distance. You get to look up my journal whenever ur bored and get an update on whats goin on in my life without any of the trouble of actually talking to me. And yet u still call urselves my friends. So this is my way of finding out who my true friends are. Maybe if i don't update for a while people will start to remember my phone # or where I live and make an actual effert to be in my life. Show me that im important to you in some way. Show me im just not another website u go to in ur free time. Show me our friendships still exist and stand strong. I'll be waiting for ur call. Until then fairwell livejournal, and i hope to be back soon.

Then after that stupidity do u use her own cousin as an alibi as to where u were when u weren't answering ur phone. I think not. Then do u not even try to talk ur way out of it when ur busted...DO u simply reply to her questions wiht a ""u didn't ask thats y i didn't say anything"" or a ""i didn't hear the phone"" even though she called both lines like 3 times. No cuz obviously all this would only lead to u loosing out on both the girl ur seeing and the ex on the side, since they both go to school together and word travels fas.t Especially when the girl ur seeing is Nikki and I don't take ur shit. I dumped ur ass last night before I even talked to Kathleen today which is prolly gonna kick u to the curb to if shes smart. You wasted how much time trying to keep this a secret and it all came unravelled right b4 ur eyes in less then 24hrs. U tried to play us both and as far as i go the game is OVA! bye bye

So we could end up stringing
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror
How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
And try to turn the tables?
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Lets rewrite and ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

A matter of fact you feel anything but. Should you then feel guilty for not feeling guilty?"

"event","A lot has happened since the last time I chatted with you readers, but then again not a lot has happened. I got my licence and I'm getting ready for homecoming a week from wednesday, not sure how itz gonna go with tony as my date but at this point I don't care. A quarter of the school year has gone by already and I sent my Rider application in last week. I'm still single but I've been pondering the whole question ""does age really matter"". Now I'm goin to homecoming with tony who's 21 but I've been chillin with this guy Clay who's 16. Now granted clay is literally less then a year younger then me he is two grades lower then me (when he moved here from A.C they made him repeat his frosh year). Anywho nobody cares that tony is 21 but i guarentee if I were to wind up with Clay I'd be the center of everyones convo. Also I was a soph dating a Senior and nobody cared cuz it was the guy dating a younger girl....hypocrits much? anyway enough with that. I still talk to Ry on a day to day basis and Kenny has since moved away. I work 30hrs a week which doesn't allow me a lot of time to chit chat online. Beths 18th b-day was last friday and we all went out for dinner which was nice. I have the SAT's on the 6th. Thats pretty much all thats goin on...I told u it might seem like a lot but itz really not. Just the same ol same not complainin and not bragging. As for the whole Tony buttacavoli thing, his lil bro has a thing for me so I just elimintaed them both and cut my losses. Thats all for now folks...till next time."

"event","I have a tendency of wearing my heart on my sleeve and getting very easily attached to someone and buliding my hopes up basically setting myself up for failure. Thats one of my characteristics i would change if possible. It hurts soooo much when you make a "" physical connection"" with someone (hook up) knowing that it meant atleast something if not everything to you only to find out afterwards that it meant nothing to them. U just want to crawl up in a ball and slowly seperate urself from the rest of the world until the pain just stops. Not only has that happened to me more then once i realized I've even done that to otheres a few times and that hurts me just as much. I can't even describe how im feeling rite now...confused, unsure of myself, dissapointed in myself and others....that doesn't even begin to describe it. I just feel empty inside."

September 05, 2003 

There are different levels of friendship. This time you learn that maybe you weren't as far up the rungs as you thought, because somebody is pulling rank on you. All you wanted was a fair chance, but you may not get one if you have to bow down to this petty dictator. You can see the effects of different people's hidden agendas clashing in the middle distance. Unless you're ready to bail out now, this is your immediate future. Try to educate yourself about a situation before committing your time to it and entering the fray.

September 06, 2003 What are you getting into? People around here are playing mind games. Normally you'd be up for the adventure, but this time no one bothered to explain the rules of engagement. Take notes about everything that happens, whether you're studying the strategic options or covering your backside against future accusations. You'll encourage rational behavior if anybody is willing to listen, but don't hold your breath. They're just as committed to their course of action as you are to yours, and that means lots of head-butting until the heads are finally sore and ready to think again. 

September 07, 2003 

Staying focused is a lost cause. The world interrupts you whenever you get started. Anyone paying close attention will notice your frequent changes of opinion. You're entitled to think whatever you want. 	

For future reference ryan and shawn...next time u think the only times i do anything rite is when i do it ur way...refer to the last line of the last horoscope ""Im entitled to think w/e I want!""
Turns out you two are a lot more alike then u thought....u both think u can walk on water...well im just gonna sit back and watch u drown"

I have only one class with any of my friends and still their only my semi friends. There are a total of 10 seniors in my lunch so that kinda bites. The second day my locker was fixed and i figured out that the reason my schedule was messed up is because i couldn't get into journalism...which bites...but i have a study hall 8th period instead...or atleast until october when i get my license and can leave early. I have a class whith seth, steves twin, and also with seans two cousins. I've met some pretty kewl new people so i should be fine. Today was pretty good not a lot of work cuz itz still early but itz friday and i don't have work so plans definetly need to be made. Me and Kenny are still not on speaking terms and me an ry chilled last nite. Other then that nothing much is new."

"event","There just weren't enough hours in the day
To give me time to say what I needed to say
To keep ur heart intertwined with mine 
To rewind to a time before we crossed the line
The line that exist, so invisible yet inevitable
In a coed friendship tragedy is probable
Problems are forseen but we hope our friendship is enough
Being in the company of a guy thats in love with u should be anything but tough
But when those feeling are a one way street 
and the ackwardness builds more and more every time we meet
And when the uncomfortable questions arise from boy to girl
""was there a good nite kiss when he walked u to ur door ""
I cringe because this is a time when honesty could make things worse
So i lie, put on my shoes and reach for my purse
You ask why im leaving and again i lie
And as i hug you fairwell u look into my eyes
I need to let u go u need to be free
Were the ""Joey and Dawson"" of 2003
Maybe someday but this isn't the right time 
I can't return ur feelings no matter how hard i try
And if being just friends with me is to hard i understand
It will hurt for awhile but on our feet we will land 
Ur life will go on u will find someone new
Someone very special and who's in love with you to"

"event","Holy shit OZZFEST was great went with my friend keith, sarah, yours truly, my gf meaghan, keiths bro, his dad, and his dads friend It was fucking great all the bands kicked ass got autographs from Slipknot (sorry to those, they only allowed 1 sig of the 3 members that were there for the signing) and i also got sigs from the 3 members of Dimmu Borgir that were at the signing. The main stage was great but the great OZZY had bronchitus and couldnt sing so the singer from Judas Priest sang so we left. Dimmu's performance was awsome but i thought there would be more of a show. (Cradles performance of last years was best iv ever seen so far) wen the pics get in ill be sure to show you all got sum great pics of the bands. As usual had a fuckign great time. laters."

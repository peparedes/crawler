i live in los angeles 
and
right after my being in high school there was a live show at the roxy
on sunset
called the rocky horror show

the buzz about it was that it was about rock and roll fags from mars

i'm not gay
or anything
but
the idea of rock and roll fags from mars
really kicked my ass
i figured there wouldn't a dick in my face
or anything
and
seeing rock and roll fags from mars
seemed like a pretty cool way to spend an evening

i was heavy into bowie 
and
alice cooper
i was very up for that kind of thing

i never got to see it live
because
nobody that i knew wanted to go see
rock and roll fags from mars

the movie came out in 1975
it was at the egyptian theatre in westwood
i went alone
again
because nobody that i knew wanted to see a movie about rock and roll fags from mars

as it turned out
it wasn't about
rock and roll fags from mars at all

it was one of the coolest movies i had ever seen in my life
i sat through it twice
(back then you could do that)
and 
i all but shit a brick

my point?

IT'S MY FUCKING MOVIE!

i love paying attention to it

you dorks are so late to it that it burns my ass

but

if you think that's it's wonderful to dress in your mother's underwear and throw toast at the screen
if you think that it's cool to yell the same thing that everybody else yells at the same time
(which really goes against what that movie is actually about)
is cool with me

(to me)
is a drop kick to the nuts
it's a thing that leaves you curled up
in a corner
gasping for air
it's a thing that CHANGES you

it's a mind and/or soul fuck

it's a thing that makes you

WONDER

it is NOT top 40!

it's a fucking train wreck

that you cannot ignore

it's a fucking explosion

in your skull

that fucks you so hard that you need a smoke and a drink and a heavy nap after it happens

that might just be me though..."

having a computer and knowing how to work it used to be about sharing information. not any more. now it's about pictures of your kids, pictures of your food, and sharing dumb ass fucking memes. and every new os just clogs the gene pool with more dumbfucks. more people who have no fucking idea about what being on line should/could be about. fuck windows 10 and fuck most of you. you have totally ruined the fucking net with your schoolyard bullshit.

really.

remember when you didn't know fuck all about computers?

that's how it should still be now.

fuck fucking you.

"event","i have been told, more than once, that i'm pretty much a buddhist. i have no idea what that means. i follow no dogma. i have no religion (other than art, whatever that means to you). all i know is that most of 'life' is a crock of shit. you do not really need to own the new wonderful thing. you do not have to follow things so that you get to feel that you 'belong' to anything. you do not need other people to give you worth. all i know is that nobody knows shit and it would really be cool if we all could just calm the fuck down.

"event","guys do this thing called 'bullshitting'
it kinda goes like this:

'yeah. i'd do your mother. in the ass!'
or
'mother teresa? i bet she could suck a dick really hard!'
or
'fuck mary ann! i wanna pump the living shit outta ginger!'

they are only lame ass jokes.
we are not all misogynists
we just laugh really hard at lame ass jokes

it's sort of like when women get together
and
make fun of how dicks are shaped
or
how we can't remember your shoe size
or
how much fun it is to have a fight about nothing at all because you haven't got a bunch of flowers lately

we are all just people

who have been programmed by pop music, bad tv, and disney movies

really?

we should all just let things slide now and then..."

"event","i dunno about you, but i like to put the plastic mustard bottle in the fridge door upside down. that way the water in it rises and i don't have to shake it up before i use it. i mean, really? doesn't it suck like an electrolux when you squirt mustard water on a sandwich? yeah. my memory is fading so i don't always remember to shake the mustard up before i use it. and to be honest? i really don't think that i should have to. it's only fucking mustard, right? who gives a shit?

anyway...

i had just gotten up, kinda blurry, not fully awake yet and 'mister in charge of all things kitchen' tells me a story. it's a FULL FUCK CONDESCENDING (like i'm 4 years old and i NEED to get my shit straight) story about how somebody didn't cap the mayonnaise the right way so he had to clean up the shelf in the fridge door. 

now...

i do not use the mayonnaise. i'm fat enough without it so i try to stay away from it. which means only one thing:

somebody else fucked up with the mayonnaise. maybe even him.

at any rate:

being just up and not all that together i let it slide.

once i got awake it dawned on me.

he just doesn't ""LIKE"" the mustard being upside down (IT LOOKS WRONG!) and i should really just let him have his way. somehow, in his bent fucking head, he IS IN CHARGE OF THE KITCHEN SO I AM WRONG!

so...

i keep putting the mustard upside down (only when i use it) and it keeps being put right side up. 

yeah, fucking whatever, right?

welp

now there are arrows drawn on the mustard and the word ""UP!"" on it written in black sharpee.

dunno about you but at this point?

i am positive that he is fucking insane.

maybe that's just me though..."

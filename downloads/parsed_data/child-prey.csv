"event","An article on Harry Potter slash. Well, <i>I</i> enjoyed reading it, anyway.


Harry Potter, the boy-wizard from J K Rowling's hugely popular children's stories, has become a homosexual fantasy on the Internet. 

Harry is now the hero of gay romances too, written and read mostly by adolescent girls. 

This fan fiction or 'fanfic' is a Web phenomenon and can be heterosexual. But 'het' fanfic is not as popular as homosexual or 'slash' fanfic is. 

In these slash fanfics, Harry is mostly paired with Draco Malfoy, his archrival, and sometimes with Ron Weasly, his best friend. Another favourite pairing is Harry and teacher Severus Snape. 
	
Consider this sampling from a Harry/Draco slash: 
<i>""I have to,"" Harry answered softly, reaching forward and drawing Draco closer to him. ""I can't not go."" Draco let Harry pull him near, and he subconsciously arched forward against the comforting warmth of Harry's body, the only comfort he trusted in these dark days, and the one thing that was being taken away from him now, and he didn't want to let Harry go, not now, not ever.</i>
	
A Harry Potter slash page for 'slightly' older folk offers titles like Dementor's Kiss, described as 'a rather twisted little fic'. Other stories promise 'romance, cunning plans, a love triangle and songs galore'.

 Rhysenn, a popular slash writer, says that these are stories ""where everything and anything goes, for a little fun."" 

Debbie, another slash writer who corresponded with Net Guide, says she does it because she perceives ""chemistry between certain characters"". She doesn't mind them belonging to the same sex because, ""love is love, no matter who is involved. I look at the subtext and enjoy these non-standard pairings"". 
	
What enjoyment does she get by writing and reading stories about relationships between men? ""I find a beauty in same-sex relationships because the couple has to really want it in order to overcome a pervasive societal bias against such pairings. They can understand each other, emotionally and physically in ways that heterosexual pairings cannot,"" explains Debbie. 
	
The excitement over slash fanfic spills on to message boards with readers and writers eagerly debating issues. 'What's your favourite pairing and why?' inquires Tatterhood. Rhysenn declares, ""My favourite pairing is Harry/Draco, followed by Lucius/James."" Slash writers also use these message boards to understand readership tastes. 
	
'Remus/Severus is the fan mail topic of the week' reads a notice at one site, urging readers to tell the writer how much they love her characters: 'The more fan mail she gets, the more inclined she'll be to write them into the next chapter.' 
	
But like all things that buck convention, slash too has attracted controversy. 
	
College student Pravin Shah is indignant: ""The fact that writers who are supposed to be fans can give such twists to popular stories sickens me."" 
	
To such familiar reactions, fanfic writers say, don't read them. 
	
One, who goes by the name Firebolt says, ""Most stories are marked with warnings all over. If you pay attention to the summary and the author's notes at the top, you have perfect control over what you read. And if the author has enough respect for your dislike of slash to write the warnings, shouldn't you have enough respect for their ideas to leave the story alone?"" 
	
Despite tantalising titles like Love Between Rivals, Irresistible Poison and Stealing Sweaters, there aren't always takers. Mumbai housewife Caroline Rodrigues maintains that such fiction is inappropriate for its use of characters from a children's book. 

But a writer from New Zealand claims that fanfic ""Has no age barriers and while the book itself may be for children it doesn't mean fan fiction is supposed to reflect that."" 
	
Writers argue that most stories are set in the future with the characters having grown up. ""I have yet to read a story where the characters are younger than 14,"" says one reader. But who said 14 was mature? 
	
Many also decry the classification of all slash fiction as pornography simply because the characters belong to the same sex. 
	
Debbie has a point to make: ""A kiss is a kiss, no matter who's doing it"", explaining that while most slash stories ""have no more nor less sexual content than comparative heterosexual fics"", the latter are not considered porn. ""Pornography connotes something dirty. Pure graphic sex without emotion or plot. To lump all slash fics together and say their authors are involved with porn is an insult to the emotional and plot-based stories we try to create,"" Debbie argues. 
	
An echo comes from slash writer Amy Fortuna: ""Less than a third of my stories contain sex. It's about the relationship."" 
	
Not everybody buys these arguments though. ""Sure it's porn. What did you think it was, wholesome entertainment?"" a Mumbai Potter fan asks. 

There is also the legal angle. While Warner Brothers has reportedly taken a grim view of such sites, saying it is a violation of intellectual property rights, writers and fans of slash have been quick to defend themselves. 
	
Slash writer Elysian insists that it does not violate copyrights because it isn't done for money: ""The only payment I'm receiving for this venture is my own twisted satisfaction. Please don't sue me. I'm fragile."" While Author Jules threatens, ""If they're looking for a fight, they will get one!"" 

Debbie points to the fact that writers are careful to put up disclaimers acknowledging that they aren't the owners of anything related to Harry Potter. She does not subscribe to the view that Potter slash results in negative publicity for the movie or books: ""Any negative view will be a mere drop in the bucket. There will not be any significant impact on the genre as a whole."" 
	
To prove her point, she talks of people who denounce Harry Potter as promoting witchcraft: ""Those people have a much larger voice than slash activists but even they have not been able to curb the flood of admiration for Rowling's creation.""

"event","By a friend of my Father's. 




I am of the lost tribe,
The forgotten people,
And I drive the bad black road 
Across Turtle Island.
But the turtle is broken
And bleeding on the dotted yellow line
Where it was hit by an eighteen wheeler.
I am a gen-u-wine native
As you can tell by the dreamcatcher
That hangs from my rearview mirror
And my Leonard Peltier bumpersticker.

My skin is red  
On the back of my neck
And on my left arm 
Where it hangs out the window, 
Because my truck has no air conditioning.
I paint my face
When I go to ball games 
Where I yell and wave 
My foam rubber tomahawk.
I like fry bread, fried potatoes,
Fried pies and fried tomatoes,
And in fact nearly anything 
Cooked in grease. 

My rez is right here
In these size ten and a half,
Made in China, 
Walmart hiking boots.
My head dress is a Mossy Oak 
Camoflage cap with NAPA on the front.
But I've got a plaque
With a prayer by Chief Seattle
And a statue of a howling wolf
That I bought in an outlet store
On the Florida state line.

It is a long time 
Since my grandmother passed on.
She was a little woman 
Who dipped Bruton snuff
And chewed plug tobacco,
And when she could stand
There was always flour
On her hands and apron.
I can still smell the smell
Of tobacco and old fashioned perfume
And bacon grease and age.
I can still feel the frail bent body
And the gnarled hands
Something between an ancient tree
And a fragile bird.

My people did not put their dead
On platforms for the winds 
To carry their spirits home.
We put them in a hole in the ground
And marked them with a board
Or a white stone.
And the briars grew up
And the boards rotted
And the stone was smothered
In honeysuckle,
And the bulldozers came
And put up a subdivision.

I cannot find my people
In the white man's records.
We did not baptize our babies
In the white man's church.
Man and wife took each others hands
In the presence of their families
Without the white man's papers.
We dodged the census man
Because he might find the liquor still.
And my great grandmother powdered her face 
White for the photographer
When she posed with her white husband
And her almost white kids.

I am the last of my people 
There will not be any more.
I made sure on the night
That my son was conceived
That no part of my native blood 
Passed into him.
He will never feel the things
That tear me apart.
He is a white boy,
All white.

My son will never slow down
When he passes a fairground
Where a pow wow is going on.
He will never turn his car around
And sheepishly fork over the price of admission.
He will never sway to the sound of drums
And feel the urge to shuffle and stomp
When he does not know how.
He will never stand outside the circle
And wish he could go inside
And share in the feeling and belong.
My son will never hang his head
And go back to the midway
Where he will buy some cheap piece
Of fake Indian kitsch made in Hong Kong
And fight with his wife about 
What he did with twenty dollars.
My son will never feel the hostile stare
Of the dancers in feathered finery
Who mutter under their breath
""Jeep Cherokee"".

My son will not weep
When he visits New Echota,
And Wounded Knee will be 
A nameless dot in a far away state.
When my son stands on Gahuti,
Our mother mountain,
He will never reach up to the sky
Or out to the trees
And then worry that he has offended
The One True God who owns his heart
And bought him with His blood.
My son will sit in a square white church
In a square white pew
And sing square white hymns
And listen to the square white words
And he will never need anything more.

This pain will die with me."

If Die drinks an average of 10 six-packs of beer a day at approximately 5 cans per hour while Toshiya pulls on Shinya's hair with about 70 lbs of torque (with Shinya screaming at a decible of about 32974 Hz), how long would it take for Kaoru to demand that Kyo wake up at exactly 7:30 a.m.?"

"event","Well, today I set out to go look at fabrics and sewing whatnot[I really like that word]. I was dismayed to find they had no books for beginners or something in that area, but they did have the Afghans for All Seasons magazine, which coincidentally struck me as hilarious. So all in all, I learned nothing today. But I figure that just standing there in the sewing area boosted my overall knowledge of how to sew. Maybe if I go and stand around there all the time, I'll become a pro really fast. In other news, my fingers hurt really bad from excess guitar playing. Man, am I a newbie."

"event","Alrighty. This would be my second livejournal, actually. The name, if you do not know, is the title of a very kick-ass Dir en Grey song. My previous livejournal got too old and un-updated to continue any further. I shall try to update this as much as my Ujournal. I'll probably just copy and paste what I post there in here. Make sense? Of course it does. Here's the link to my Ujournal, anyway.

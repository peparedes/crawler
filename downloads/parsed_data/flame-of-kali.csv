"event","So I went with Esther, Ariel, and Ha, a girl that lives acroos the hall from me. She's nice, she's another math major. We all got dressed up. Yay for feeling pretty. The party was from 10pm - 2am. We went at 10, gambled with the complimentry ""funny money"" the was handed out at the door. I found out that unlike my father, most parents don't teach their children to gamble from an early age; I was really amazed that most of my friends had never played blackjack or poker. Lost $10,000 of my $40,000 and then got bored because there wasn't a large vareity of games. About that time, approx. 11:00, Esther and Ariel were getting pretty restless too so we went to the other building where the dancing was. We lost Esther to her ""date"" for the rest of the night about half an hour in. Then we lost Ha to several of her friends. 6 guys asked me to dance. I danced with 4 of them. The first one was pretty nice but he lost interest after I told him I wouldn't go outside with him. The second one wished he was a player and came about 10 seconds away from me kneeing him as a comment about personal space, by personal space I mean if I can feel the hard-on you're way too close. He left me alone after only a couple minutes when he realized that, no, I wasn't going to sleep with him. The third guy, who was also the fifth guy, I asked to dance. He was standing on the edge of the room with his friend looking kind of lonely. He was cute, mostly sober, a good dancer, polite, and the only guy who didn't try to get in my pants. His name is Alex, he has my phone number. <shrug> We'll see what happens. I was dancing with Ariela nd Ali when the forth guy randomly started dancing with me. He left after I gave obviously the wrong answer when he asked me what I was doing that night. Ariel and I had a good giggled at that. Later another wannabe player tried to ask me to dance:

Him: ""You have a really nice body."" (really not a good pick-up line)
Me: ""Thanks.""
Him: ""Do you have a boyfriend?""
Me: ""No.""
Him: ""That's horrible. I don't have a girlfriend.""
Me: ""Yeah, but my girlfriend will be pissed when she sees me talking to you."" *wave* ""Bye""

The look of frozen terror on his face was priceless. The next guy that asked me I just told that I wasn't interested. I wasn't, my feet hurt too much; a lot of people stepped on my toes last night. Then Alex found me again and we danced for a while. I came back to my room, alone thank you, around 2am. Ariel, Esther and I had a little post-party. We ate some chips and cookies and drank the sparkling cider we had bought for the occasion. Ariel got tired and went to bed. I beat Esther at a game of chess. She ended up sleeping here because of a minor ""incident"" with her roommate earlier that night. 

All in all I had fun. Now I'm off to switch my laundry and finish some reading for class."

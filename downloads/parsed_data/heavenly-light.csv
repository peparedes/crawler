Well... first NaNo ate my brain, and then it was Christmas. And then I was all ""wtf I have a job, you mean I have to LEAVE THE HOUSE?"" and got distracted. So... yes.

But actually I'm all out of order now, because one of my Christmas presents was a paper copy of <i>Othello</i>, and I sort of read it all in one go instead of going through it one scene at a time. But I'm <i>still</i> going to do the scene by scene overanalysis, because, y'know. And because I was just up to that scene where Cassio gets drunk, and I love that scene.

But <i>anyway</i>. Even though this is skipping ahead massively (omg spoilers ahead: EVERYONE DIES. Except Cassio. And Bianca, actually), so, I got up to Emilia's death scene, and what is possibly my favourite line in all Shakespeare ever: <i>Thou hast not half the power to do me harm as I have to be hurt.</i>

And... I love this line on so many levels. I mean, I know that the translation is essentially ""... I can take anything you can give out, BITCH"", and I love <i>that</i>, but I also love that whether by design or just because of the changes in modern speech (I'm honestly not sure), it seems to have a double meaning, like she's saying ""ha, my feelings run deeper than anything you could understand"". I love that she says ""thou"" (does she do this all the way through, or is it an actual change to show non-respectful-ness? *needs to check*). And, uhm, I am generally so in love with that entire scene that I would quite possibly attempt to marry it if it was legal to propose to intangible concepts.

... but for now I need sleep. And not to be rambling about stuff all out of order. (I am seriously more asleep than awake at this point, so please excuse any nonsensical stuff in here. I just wanted to post because if I didn't do it now while I was thinking of it, I would have ended up neglecting this project for another month, which would be BAD.)"

"event","... okay, it lives! I had intended to keep up with this journal rather more often, but got sightly distracted from it this past week by sickness and NaNo planning.

Anyway. Onward. Act 2, Scene 1.

Awww. Cassio is waxing lyrical about Desdemona again.

<i>... he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame;
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener.</i>

Sniffle. I hate the fact that this sort of <i>total and utter fluff</i> got used against him. 

<lj-cut text=""okay, this one got long"">
... I always sort of imagined Cassio and Desdemona as childhood friends, or at least very long-running ones. I realise this is unlikely since he's <i>not from Venice</i>, and I think it's generally assumed that he's primarily Othello's friend/colleague and thus probably knows Desdemona through him rather than vice versa, but for some reason in my own little version of the Othello universe I always imagined them as having known each other for <i>years</i>; that if anyone <i>had</i> suggested they ought to get it on, the reaction would have been something along the lines of ""... ewww, that'd practically be incest"". I think it's perhaps just that they seem to have so much innocent affection for each other, that it kind of suggests that sort of pre-adolescent friendship somehow... 

(Of course, Desdemona is quite often played as young as sixteen or seventeen, so I suppose at least on her part it would only have to go five or six years back to qualify as ""pre-adolescent""...)

And yes, indeed: this scene is Emilia's first entrance. Emilia is my favourite character in this play by some distance, and I do, as mentioned in the first entry, feel a particular connection with her, so, um, huzzah. 

... ah, Emilia. I suppose it may seem weird that I latched on so much to a comparatively minor character; I have semi-described why in my <a href=""http://www.sunlesslands.net/emilia/why.html"">small and rather sucky shrine for her</a>, but really the only answer I can give is ""I don't know, I just did"". Perhaps it's simply that, at fourteen, I didn't tend to identify very much with male characters as a rule, and I also didn't feel that there was much I could identify with in Desdemona or Bianca - Desdemona was far too saintly and beautiful for me to feel much understanding of her, and Bianca too loud and forthright and woman-of-the-world-ish and busy having complicated love affairs, for my awkward, ugly fourteen-year-old self to connect with much. Leaving Emilia, who was snarky and cynical and wordly and flawed but good at heart; I wanted to be her when I grew up. Except, you know, ideally without getting-my-best-friend-killed bit.

... anyway. Here she is, <i>and</i> she gets to make out with Cassio. (... ok, ok, he kisses her. Chastely. And politely. With her husband standing right there. But a girl can dream...)

<i>IAGO: Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
You'll have enough.</i>

Snarky git. 

... ah, that little scene with Iago being entertaining for the girls and Cassio by, er, bitching about women. But doing it amusingly in verse. And Desdemona being all ""oh, you're so funny and crude and OMG I AM HANGING OUT WITH SOLDIERS THIS IS SO MUCH FUN"". Too cute.

... okay, Othello is back, with more shininess and True Love, and...

<i>IAGO: O, you are well tuned now!
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
As honest as I am.</i>

I love those lines. They are so perfectly sinister and nasty, all the more so for coming from someone who less than five minutes ago was being charming and amusing at her. 


Hm...

<i>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit: </i>

This... always, I don't know, puzzled me a little bit. I never know quite how to take it. It's so <i>weird</i>; I mean, it makes sense, but it's so... I don't know. Creepy, I guess. The way he just stands there and basically says ""Sure, I'll believe this. Why not. It works."" It makes me think of that whole idea about how, if you wish to tell a lie, it's best if you believe it yourself...

<i> For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife</i>

<i> For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too-- </i>

... Emilia, I believe, wishes to know where exactly her husband thinks she found the <i>time</i> to sleep with most of the Venetian army. *pets her*



And a final, slightly silly note: this online text that I'm currently reading has just cleared up something that's been vaguely puzzling me for years. The lines:

<i>The ship is here put in,
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
Is come on shore</i>

were rendered, in the printed version I first read, as:

<i>The ship is here put in.
A Veronesa, Michael Cassio,
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
Is come on shore</i>

and I was all like ""... wtf? A Veronesa? He was a Florentine ten minutes ago! OMG, this man is from EVERYWHERE IN ITALY"". But, er, yeah, it makes a lot more sense if ""Veronesa"" refers to the ship...
</lj-cut>

Ahem. Yes. My apologies for this one sounding a little disjointed; am still rather hazy and headachey today. Next up: Cassio getting drunk and angsting and Roderigo getting beaten up. Let us hope I can manage a little more coherence for that scene, as it's one I'm rather fond of."

"event","Act 1, Scene 3.

Starts with the Duke of Venice and a couple of senators discussing the political situation in Cyprus and why Othello ought to be sent out there; having established this, they're free to be interrupted by the whole Othello/Brabantio/Iago mess that's currently going on, with Brabantio making wild claims about his daughter having been stolen or hypnotised or placed under a spell; Othello once again sweeps all this away with his eloquent speech and general loveliness, and is backed up by Desdemona; Brabantio has to back down, and everyone starts making plans for setting off to Cyprus.

Again, random observations:

This scene has some really startlingly lovely poetry, and some really beautiful individual lines and images (""a moth of peace"", ""the bloody book of law"", ""but an hour of love, of worldly matters and direction""); the speeches made by Othello, Desdemona and Brabantio while they're discussing whether or not she's been bewitched are all beautiful. ""That I did love the Moor, to live with him..."" always sticks in my head, and:

<i>""She loved me for the dangers I had passed,
And I loved her that she did pity them.""</i>


<i>""My life upon her faith.""</i> Mmmmm, foreshadowing.

After this is all more or less resolved, everyone departs leaving Iago and Roderigo alone onstage; we get to see Iago switch (apparent) allegiances again, and drop out of verse, presumably to mark the change in mood. Roderigo is stomping around the place being an emo kid again, and threatening to drown himself; Iago responds to this with his rather lengthy, and rather famous, ""Put money in thy purse"" speech; all the beautiful speeches about love and valour that we've just heard have presumably not affected him much. Having cheered Roderigo up and sent him off smiling, he then immediately turns to the audience and tells us ""Thus do I ever make my fool my purse"" - clarifying fully for the first time that he's not, actually, on Roderigo's side, or any side but his own; he also comes up, for the first time, with his plan for revenge on Othello and Cassio (he doesn't appear to have anything specific against Desdemona, but doesn't mind screwing her over in the process). Having worked this out, he leaves us with:

<i>""I have it. It is engendered. Hell, and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.""</i>

... and then we all go off to Cyprus, where the actual plot begins."

"event","Act 1, Scene 2. (No, I'm not always going to post in here three times a day. Honest. Well, probably.)

This is the first scene in which we actually meet the title character... Vague thought that I don't know how to express: the contrast of the language used by Iago and Othello. I'd noticed this before, but... it's like all Othello's speeches here are designed to fill our minds with all this fine, bright, noble imagery and establish him as Good and Shiny. They're full of words like ""honour"" and ""love"" and ""gentle"" and ""light"", and written in very elegant verse which sort of stands out against the way Iago speaks...

And he's so <i>confident</i>. Heh. "" My parts, my title and my perfect soul/Shall manifest me rightly."" And so sure he'll be able to explain everything and nobody's going to harm him... I really like him, here.

Couple of notes:

<i>IAGO:      By Janus, I think no.</i>

Janus? Interesting. Did sixteenth-century Venetians make a habit of swearing by the old Roman gods? (And of course, a nice touch that Iago's invoking the two-faced one.)

<i>IAGO:       'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
CASSIO: 	I do not understand.
IAGO: 	He's married.
CASSIO: 	To who?</i>

... oh, Cassio is just adorable here. This ""... land carrack? I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN"" bit would be cute enough as is, but later on of course we find out that he knows exactly who Othello's married to because he's been in on it all along - he's presumably being extra cautious and covering up for them."

"event","Okay, starting. Act 1 Scene 1.

For some reason, as much as I adore this play,I have to admit that I'm always a little tempted to skim over these first scenes, which seems to me to draw out the ""Desdemona's father finds out she's eloped but it turns out ok in the end"" plotline for a strangely long time; much of it, I suppose, is setting up the plot, introducing the characters, making sure the audience knows who the good guys and bad guys are. Iago explains his motivation, re: Cassio being promoted (which, as numerous literary scholar types have noted, you know, <i>worst motivation ever</i>. Or at least a little disproportionate), and demonstrates his ability to switch apparent allegiances without so much as pausing for breath.

... okay, one of the things I <i>have</i> picked up on re-reading, and am not sure I'd fully noticed before, is how much Iago pretty much announces straight out ""Hey, I'm a lying fuck; don't trust me,"" and yet everyone still does.  I mean, he demonstrates to Roderigo right off that he isn't the most trustworthy person ever, by showing how easily and convincingly he lies to Othello and Cassio, and yet Roderigo persists in thinking, well, <i>I</i> know the full story, he won't lie to <i>me</i>, I'm in on it... Human nature, I suppose? And then there's all that ""Whip me such honest knaves"" and ""I am not what I am"" and...

""Others there are
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
And such a one do I profess myself""

I mean, yeah. It's not like poor Roderigo could say he wasn't <i>warned</i>.

I always quite liked Roderigo, actually. I mean, yeah, he's kind of a git, but I mean... as a character, I liked him, and it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the little idiot. I saw him played once as... this skinny kid in his late teens with one of those long indie-kid duffel-coat things, and thought it worked wonderfully. Roderigo as a Smiths fan... *grins* It just I don't know, suited him. All that zomg why don't I have a girlfriend angst, and the way he was uncertain enough of himself to be talked into doing such dreadful stupid things...

(I like the Smiths, incidentally. I have nothing against Smiths fans or indie angstbunnies, though I do feel they should try to avoid becoming sidekicks to sociopathic murderers whenever possible.)"

"event","A bit more than a year ago, I was in Australia, having been flown out there for a family wedding; I was pretty physically ill from a combination of CFS and jetlag, and I was, let's say, having a difficult time of things emotionally too, just at that particular time. I had, however, met up with my dear LJ-friend <lj user=""rakarr"">, which was very much cheering me up.

Anyway, there I am, staggering along a street in Sydney, not having slept in about 48 hours and just generally wishing I was dead, and I hear: 

<i>Excuse me, would you like to see </i>Othello<i> tonight?</i>

This pretty much stopped me in my tracks.

The guy who'd been saying that wasn't actually talking to me - he was talking to two girls a little way behind me on the street. Still, my supersonic Cocktail Party Effect (google it) hearing picked up the word ""Othello"" and went ZOMG WHAT WAS THAT, and I grabbed Rak and hissed ""Did that guy just say OTHELLO IS PLAYING HERE?"" and we went back and interrogated him. Yes, it turned out, there was a production of it on that night. Yes, there were tickets left; enough left that this poor guy had been sent out to harass passers-by into coming and watching it.

Unfortunately, I was so excited that I forgot to ask him where it was and left entirely without doing so. 

Fortunately, there was an internet cafe nearby(ish) where I managed to Google details of ""othello sydney theatre aug 2004"".

Anyway, to cut a long story short, eventually we found it, and we turned up that evening, me wildly excited because ZOMG OTHELLO and Rak slightly bemused but perfectly willing to give it a try.

It was very, very good. Particularly helped, as far as I was concerned, by the fact that Emilia was played as well as I've ever seen her done; young, still rather pretty, protective of Desdemona, chain-smoking, bitchy and bitter without being horrible, generally fantastic. Even the fact that I was still so sick I had to leave the theatre at least twice to throw up didn't detract from it.

I am not sure what the point is of telling this story, except possibly that when I was at an incredibly low point this thing FELL OUT OF THE SKY and gave me something fantastic to remember the trip by.

(A few weeks later, sitting in a hired cottage in Queensland and with it still buzzing round in my head, I wrote - longhand, because I had no computer - a very long and rather pretentious essay about Emilia and her general moral/character development during the play and how she can in a sense be seen as Othello's opposite number. I may post it here, or at least extracts from it, if I can find it.)"

"event","So, ah... hello, and welcome to my Re-Reading Othello And Also Probably Some Other Stuff Later journal. The title, as more or less explained in the userinfo, comes from a line spoken by Emilia, always my favourite character (she took up residence in my head when I first read it in 1994 and shows no signs of leaving yet). The concept was slightly shamelessly stolen from <lj user=""9ringingbells"">, a journal created to record thoughts and reactions from re-playing through the video game Secret of Mana. Sprite (of the aforementioned <i>Nine Ringing Bells</i> has often discussed how she feels that the game inspired her spirituality and had an deep and permanent effect on her; well, for me, it was reading Shakespeare that did that. Incredibly dorky and pretentious, I agree, but nonetheless the first time I became acquainted with <i>Othello</i>, aged fourteen, it was like a lightswitch going on in my head. I adored it, and proceeded to obsess over it for <i>years</i>. I don't think it's any exaggeration to say that I have lived my life a certain way because of that play, that if I had never read it I would have grown into a different person, however subtly or dramatically. To borrow a phrase from another LJ-friend, it has ""grafted itself onto the language of my subconscious""; as a teenager I knew almost the whole thing by heart, I'd recognise the phrases from it which have worked their way into the English language (<i>green-eyed monster, to wear one's heart on one's sleeve, it's neither here nor there...</i>) and smile to myself whenever I heard them spoken. The characters became as familiar to me as my family and friends; I understand all the delicate relationships between them all and felt as if I <i>knew</i> them; Emilia - my particular favourite - has stayed around and lived with me, as it were, for years. It was the first time I'd ever fallen so deeply in love with a story and it set up a love of Shakespeare and literature in general that's stayed with me ever since.

So here: I shall be re-reading it scene by scene and blethering on about my thoughts, reactions, literary analysis, etc. Feel free to read, or to just skip over it.

... Em might throw in a comment or two, too. ;)"

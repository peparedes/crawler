Ice shouldn't burn or a bumblebee fly 
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry? 
Oh nothin' bout love makes sense. 

Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea 
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas 
Someone so perfect can't be falling for me. 
Oh nothin' bout love makes sense. 

Nothin' bout love is less than confusing 
You can win when you're losing, stand when you're falling 
I can't figure it out. 
Nothin' bout love can make an equation nothin' short of amazing 
Wish I could explain it 
But I don't know how. 

The way that we dance, the reason we dream 
That big Italian tower, well how does it lean? 
Something so strong shouldn't make me this weak 
Oh nothin' bout love makes sense.

Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no

I can't wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that
Look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same thing
Over and over again

Oh but I think she's leaving on
And she's leaving here
And I don't know what else to do
(Can't go on not loving you)

Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath
You took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you
Or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps
Playing in my head
Over and over again
It play in my head
Over and over again

Oh but I think she's leaving on
And she's leaving here
And I don't know what else to do
(Can't go on not loving you)

Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no

Now that I realize
That I'm going down
From all this pain you
Put me through
Everytime I close my eyes
I like it down
Oh, I can't go on not loving you

Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no

Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep

Good Song:

Locked Up 


[AKON] 
Im steady tryna find a motive, 
Why do what i do?, 
Freedom aint gettin no closer, 
No matter how far i go, 
My car is stolen, no registration, 
Cops patrolin, and now they done stop me, 
And i get locked up, 

[Chorus] 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 

[Akon] 
Headin up town to ria, 
Back with a couple peeps, 
Caught a blocks on fire, 
Under covers dressed as fiends, 
Makin so much money, 
Ride up smooth and fast, 
Put away the stash, 
And as i sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up 

[CHORUS] 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (my nigga im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (i got locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (baby girl im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Cuz visitation no longer comes by, 
Seems like they forgot about me, 
Commissary is getting empty, 
My cell mates getting food without me, 
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life, 
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right 
But instead Im here locked up

[CHORUS] 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, 
(ohhh im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, 
(my nigga im locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 

Maybe a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Maybe a visit baby (they won't let me out)
Cuz im locked up, they won't let me out.
Wheres my lawyer? (they won't let me out)
Im locked up, they won't let me out, no.
Get me outta here (they won't let me out)
Im locked up, they won't let me out, they won't let me out.
Baby Im locked up they won't let me out, no
Where's my niggaz? 
On the lock-down. 
Damn, im locked up, they won't let me out. 
Im locked up, they won't let me out. 
Ohhh... they won't let me out. 
Can you please accept my phone calls? 
Cuz Im locked up, locked up, locked up."

With Christina...it was her first time riding a roller coastershe was so scared it was so funny the very first one that we went on was one that went upside down 8 times!!! all she kept saying was ""OMG, Amanda I am gonna kill you"" ....but all in all we had a really fun time :)


Did you ever feel like you wanna be 
Someone else for just one day,
Did you ever feel like you wanna 
See through another pair of lies,
Did you ever think I'm a wannabe with 
Anyone else just one day,
Did you ever you really think of me when i walked away?

You look, you don't sound apologetic,
You smoke your subjects at my eyes, like you think,
You know where you think you'll find, you think you'll figure me out tonight,
But you'll never know what i won't share,
Cause I don't care and I don't care,
You think you'll figure me out tonight, 
But I don't care,

And I wonder, if I'm just built this way,
Cause every man that I know, makes me feel like'I'm too plain'
When it's over and my selfish ways,
Go back to start again, go back to start again.

Did you ever feel like you should have said
Something smarter at that time,
Did you ever feel like you should have kept 
In all to yourself,
Did you ever think it might be your fault 
And never promise anymore,
Did you ever think it might not be me 
Now it was always me? 

You look, you don't sound apologetic,
You smoke your subjects at my eyes, like you think,
You know where you think you'll find, you think you'll figure me out tonight,

So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh , oh oh, oh oh

Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something You said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought that we could be

[Chorus:]
You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

Oh oh, oh oh,oh oh, oh oh, oh , oh 


You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they
But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it

All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done


He was everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I just stared out my window
Dreaming of a could-be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

Trying not to reach out
But when I'd try to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray (I would pray)
I could breakaway

[Chorus:]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
I'll make a wish 
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I'll take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

[Chorus:]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
I'll make a wish 
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I'll take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around wild indoors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk
Take chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway

 ***Sooner or later we begin to realize that love is more that just verses on valentine's day and romance in the movies. We begin to know that love is here and now, real and true the most important thing in our lives. For love is the creator of our favourite memories and the foundation of our fondest dreams. Love is a promise that is always kept, a fortune that can never be spent, a seed that can flourish in even the most unlikely of places. This radience that never fades, this mystirious and magical joy, is the greatest treasure of all-
one known only by those who love

"event","AHHH its been forever since i posted again--- ive been really bad about this.  im tryin though.  Lets see what have i done.  Another crazy weekend.  This time it was in the city though with Kelly, Melina, and her boyfriend Sonu.  Hes sooo sweet.  Anyway it was lots of fun.  It was kinda crazy though, i think that im gonna go back out with them the weekend after next cuz this weekend is closed cuz of the fucking play its majorly stupid...
Ummmmm... TJ got suspended again. *Big Surprise!*  He has to go and see a therapist and they have to decide whether or not he should come back to knox.  I feel kinda bad because everyone thinks hes an alchy but he really doesnt drink anymore then the rest of us he just gets caught alot more... lol.
People have been pissing me off for lots of little shit today- i dont really know why its kinda stupid.  Like melina was pissing me of because she didnt give me back my cell phone that she borrowed last night but i didn't even miss it and i had no right to be angry about it. and then i was mad at emily because i was looking for a belt in courtney's room and i found a whole bunch of my clothes taht i thought i lost in the dresser that emily uses.  And then  movitsa had play practice so she ate early dinner and i had to waiter the table which was a pain in the ass because ive waitered teh last two rotations and ill prolly have to waiter the rest of this week because there are play practices cuz the plays on friday.  
HMMMMM... what else. Ive been really horny again lately.  Seriously though, the koreans are looking better and better everyday.  Ted is always all over me and Im always over Jason.  I just dont want a reputation.  thats what i dont want to fuck anyone at knox.  Word gets around too fast.  Anyway... the elections today **YAAAAYYY** I really really hope that kerry wins but i know that bush will, its inevitable. Also, the internet been really gay in houghton and so has the hot water and i really sucks when you have to go down to fuckin dinner smellin like horse. Speaking of... I got to ride Doc again today and he was an asshole.  People prolly me included have been holding on to him too much over jumps and now he throws his head over jumps.  its a major pain in the ass.  
Anyway--- i still have some homework to do.  i have to copy my notes into my new readers notebook. *yay* one thats not ghetto and ripped.  I dont think im gonna go to tuck tonight but i wanna go to bed early tonight.  No more all nighters for me.  So ill try to update again tomorrow.  
Hugs and Kisses---

"event","AHHH idk what to do!! I really really like Imbrogno and i think he might like me (or at least give me a chance) if he just knew everything.  But now all of a sudden natalia wants so ass from him too.  And i cant really blame her or get mad at her because shes known him for a lot longer then me but its like she never said anything about it before i told her.  And i really like him.  Hes so sweet but i think he has feelings for dani and natalia and if he does i dont want to screw anything up... Anyway... Im talking to him now and ill write more after tuck..."

"event","Im only gonna write for another couple of minutes because natalia and i are getting ready to go to bed.  She has to finish annotating a story and im just messin around on my computer.  Anyway... The drama at knox continues... Louisas mad at me i think and maggies mad at me i think.  I dont really know what i did but i never said anything, i dont think, upset either of them and now their being all weird around me.  And don't even get me started on the whole Frankie/Candice thing... And i mean no disrespect of either of them by that its just that its getting so confusing i dont think that either of them know where they stand anymore... In my opinion (although GOD knows what thats worth these days) i dont see how you can have a relationship if you dont even know why you are angry at each other.  But thats enough on that subject because who knows might be offended by that... JPJP. im just a little tired cant ya tell? 
My room is a mess its gonna take me forever to clean tomorrow- i have to get up at 630 to shower ughness.  But life is good... *fake cheesy smile*... RIGHT. At least natalia will stand in the bathroom while i shower and flush the toilet so i have some semi-warm/not freezing my ass off water.

Im gonna say peace before i manage to piss anyone else off...
PEACE

"event","Wow... Time goes by really fast at this school.  I have havent had an entry since September.  But my computer has been broken which is also why i havent been on AIM, and why all my teachers like hate me because i havent been able to get anything printed in like 2 weeks.  Anyway its been crazy here.  There is so much drama at this school its ridiculous.  Its such a small school and news travels so fast.  There are only 15 kids in the entire freshmen class which makes it even worse because you cant just get in an argument with one person you get angry at all their friends too.  This school is full of clicks.  Its just like mean girls with the plastics, the cool asians, and the nerdy asians.  
Actually the asians are one of the best parts of this school. they're always around you because there are so many of them. And i love how they all give themselves american names. Like Jason Lee whose real name is Ming Eu Lee.  I mean seriously how to you get from Ming Eu to Jason.  Do something that sounds at least remotely similar like Michael.  But anyway they are all really sweet.  OR maybe i'm just horny.  I seriously havent had any ass in 3 weeks and i need some... BAD.  I have the hugest crush on Imbrogno.  And anyone who actually knows him is gonna laugh.  But hes sweet and i think hes cute.  But i have a hard time getting his reputation at this school out of my head.  Im afraid that if he and i were to hook up that i would be classified as some kind of slut.  Not that I really care about what people think about me its just like i said before this school is soo small that if one person hates you half the school hates you and the other half is on your side. Anyway-- im kinda distracted by the yankees game their in the 11th and its 4,4.  Ill write again after lights out because i have wireless in my room now... YAY."

"event","I love ms. Ghazey sooo much!!! She's like the best advisor in the world!  She took Natalia, Danielle, Courtney and I out to dinner tonight because Natalia's birthday is tomorrow.  And so we went to this steak house (clearly i didnt pick the restaurant) and it was funny because we all had to like pile into the school suburban.  But ANYWAY... We went out to this place and we ate sooo much food. I feel soo sick.  We took a bunch of stuff home too.  So on the way home we stopped at the supermarket to get soda and stuff and danielle wanted to get Natalia balloons for her birthday so we picked out the balloons, bought them and the guy was going to go blow them up for us.  Meanwhile, we were only supposed to be spending 5 minutes tops in the store because we had to be back on campus no later then 7:00.  We gave them the balloons at 6:45.  Fifteen minutes later the idiots came out and were like we popped one.  Do you want this one instead.  We said yeah and they left for another 5 minutes.  We didnt end up getting back out to the car until 7:05 and didn't get back to school until 7:20.  I felt really bad because i really didn't want ms. ghazey to get in trouble because shes the coolest in the whole school.  But i think its okay because no one has said anything to her yet. 

Anyway--- the beginning of today was funny too.  Stupid Emily.  As we were walking out of vocal ensamble today.  She runs up behind me and pulls up my skirt.  And of course i was wearing a thong.  So i turn around to see who it was and i saw emily but Ted Parks was standing right behind me to.  I was mortified.  I walked around the rest of the day holding my skirt down.  NEVER AGAIN will I wear a skirt without shorts underneath.  Lesson learned...

Then today at riding, Courtney had like an anxiety attack and i scared the shit out of me.  I was really worried about her but she seemed fine after we went out to dinner.  Anyway ive gotta go its lights out.  Ill try to come back on later if i can get internet in my room.  LOL..

"event","Wow... Crazyness.  Liz, courtney, candice and i all went to court's house for the weekend.  The first night (friday) we just walked around RVC and almost no one was there.  But then- liz spotted the two really hot guys sitting in their car, so i went up and asked if they had a lighter.  So we got to talking and we all lied our ages I said that i was 19 and courtney and liz were 17 and candice was 15 and my little sister.(in reality im the youngest of the 4 :-)) So we were talking and we asked if they could get us weed and they said they could so they left and courtney's dad picked us up.  Then we walked around courtneys neighborhood waiting for the guys to call us.  But they never did.  So finally we called them and they said that they couldn't pick us up because ""something came up.""  But it seemed like they felt really bad about it and they invited us to a keg party for the next night(saturday)  So anyway... we forgave them.  So saturday we basically sat around the house and did nothing until the night then we walked around courtneys block and at 830 we called the guys and they told us to give them a call back in like a half an hour.  So at 9 oclock we called them back and we heard freddy(on of the guys) say to someone ""hold on a second baby"" (and fyi they up until this point had said nothing about girlfriends and had promised liz and us all some ass, from which we assumed they were single.  Well--- we all know what mr. esposito says about assuming.... ANYWAY) They said that they were already at the party and drinking so they couldn't come and pick us up.  But they said we were more then welcome at the party if we could get a ride or walk.  Well we couldn't ask mr. molloy to drop us off at a keg party and we weren't about to walk 2 miles in the woods with liz on crutches.  So needless to say we ended up in downtown RVC again...  But after walking around for like half an hour we saw some people behind starbucks and started talking to them.  Turns out, courtney went middle school with most of them.  And we were all standing outside starbucks talking and more and more people kept coming. We seriously looked like a mob.  So eventually a pig rolled by and told us that we had to ""Go somewhere""  So some of us walked down toward this bodega because i wanted to get another pack of cigarettes.  So i went in and got cigs for me and a bunch of other people because apparently i can pass for 18.  Then we told everyone that we were going to sit down on a bench near the train because liz needed to sit down for a little bit.  So a bunch of guys came with us and we started talking.  One of them-- tom i think --said that we could go back and chill at his house.  He said that it was just two blocks past Seven Eleven, which we could nearly see from where we were.  So we decided that it wasnt too far and we'd all just walk.  Well- a mile and a half later.  We are all drenched in sweat, and we were taking our turns carrying liz.  And at one point liz actually got a tree stuck in her hair because the guy whose back she was on was too tall.  So we finally get their and liz and i go to the bathroom to freshen up.  So I'm peeing and liz has her head in the sink trying to cool off because crutching along is hard work.  And all of a sudden this kids dad walks in and is like ""I need to use the bathroom.""  So then he leaves and we go upstairs.  So we are all sitting around and smoking pot while some of the guys play tony hawk.  But they all wanted to play a game.  First it was strip poker, then 7 minutes in heaven, and finally they decided on spin the bottle im seriously how old are we??? Anyway--- I ended up hooking up with this kid, probally the cutest of all of them. But he was the most awful kisser ever!  He was like biting my lip.  It was rather painful.  But i got felt up so its all good.  So we called a taxi when it got their all the guys came down to say bye to us.  and courtney was like all over this kid that had the worst acne ive ever seen.  It looked like he had fungus growing on his face it was disgusting.  But on the car ride home we were all talking about the night and half way through the ride i realized that the driver was listening to everything we were saying.  I was like ""I swear were not hookers!!!""  He got a pretty good laugh about it and was making fun of courtney with the rest of us about making out with fungus face... ANYWAY... Its almost lights out at knox and i really have to clean my room if i ever want to pass room check in the morning.  So until next time... PEACE OUT."

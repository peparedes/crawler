"event","It's the annual <lj user=""wip_amnesty""> this weekend and I thought I'd take the opportunity to get these fics off my hard drive and onto my LJ. Technically, they're not WIPs, because they're actually finished. However, I never managed to convince myself before that they were ready to be posted and so they've languished. They include the first two fics I ever wrote for SGA plus one season two effort. I like to think I've improved at writing the SGA characters since then. Anyway, for better or worse here they are. 

Title - Holding On To When
Rating - NC-17
Fandom - Stargate Atlantis
Pairing - McKay/Sheppard established relationship
Disclaimer - Stargate Atlantis and its characters belong to a lot of people who aren't me.
Summary - A stolen moment.
Author's notes - Just a little ficlet written as a reaction to watching The Siege Part 1 for the first time. Can you have angsty schmoop? If so, I guess that's what this is.

<lj-cut text=""HOLDING ON TO WHEN"">
There's an almost desperate hunger driving them both. It's a stolen moment, one neither of them can really spare, but they need it more than either of them would care to admit. There's no time to return to either of their quarters so that they can do this in a bed. Nor can they indulge in slow undressing or the kind of drawn out foreplay they'd enjoy under normal circumstances. Instead, they simply find a darkened, empty room and stumble inside.

Scant lighting responds to their presence - a reminder neither of them needs about the city's power situation - and one of them remembers to keep thinking long enough to lock the door behind them. Then it's all about hands and mouths, hard and needy. They kiss as if the world's about to end and, in less than two weeks, maybe it is. For now, they keep that thought at bay as they tug at each other's clothes, needing to expose enough skin to touch and grasp and suck.

John's hands slide over the soft skin of Rodney's belly, feeling the muscles moving underneath with each sharply indrawn breath. They're so much more defined than they were just a few short months ago; one of the more visible signs of the way the Pegasus galaxy has changed Rodney. Not wanting to dwell on the less obvious marks it's left on him, John moves his hands round to clasp the smooth curve of Rodney's ass, pulling him in closer so that he can rub and thrust against John's hip.

All the while, Rodney's been exploring John's lean, rangy body. Now his capable fingers skim through the crisp trail of dark hair leading down to John's groin. He wraps his hand around John's cock, which feels hot and slick in his palm, jacking him off with single-minded concentration.

They find a rhythm, rocking together until everything explodes in a single, startling instant of release, fiery in its intensity. There have been no words spoken, barely any sounds made at all, but they don't need them, don't want them. At a time like this, words can be dangerous, articulating things it's just not possible to say when the days until the Wraith reach Atlantis keep ticking away inexorably. They both know the truth anyway. It's in their eyes, quiet, unspoken, but ever present.

As they carefully put themselves back together, reassembling their public facades, they avoid looking at one another. Neither of them wants to make this any more complicated than it already is. Rodney and his fellow scientists will be departing in a matter of hours and so much hangs on what they're going to try and do. He leaves the room first, not looking back or offering any words of farewell.

John slips out into the hallway five minutes later, resolutely heading back to his office. He has an ever-increasing list of things he needs to do to prepare for the evacuation of the city in the event that Rodney's plan fails. John doesn't want to consider that eventuality, or the possible consequences for Rodney, but he has responsibilities he won't shirk. He'll do his job and be ready, just in case. 

He knows he can't let himself be distracted, wondering when he'll see Rodney again; when they'll next have the chance to kiss and touch. But no matter what his position requires of him, John refuses to think in terms of if, rather than when.

Title - Tired

Fandom - Stargate Atlantis
Characters - McKay, Sheppard
Disclaimer - Stargate Atlantis and its characters belong to a lot of people who aren't me.
Summary - John gets the impression Rodney didn't really want to be found.
Author's notes - Written in response to watching The Defiant One for the first time.

<lj-cut text=""TIRED"">
After he's released from the infirmary, John goes in search of Rodney. Contrary to his normal list of post-mission complaints, Rodney had endured Carson's examination in near-silence and then escaped at the earliest opportunity. It's enough of an anomaly to cause John some concern.

It takes John a while to find Rodney and he gets the impression that Rodney didn't really want to be found. From his appearance it's clear that Rodney hasn't been back to his quarters since their return from the planet. John knows that he's looking a bit ragged around the edges himself after their game of cat and mouse with the lone, ancient Wraith, but Rodney looks worse. His clothes and skin still bear a fine coating of sand, but it's his face that shows the marks of their misadventures most starkly.

It's not that Rodney was injured; he'd escaped unharmed. Nevertheless, his expression when he turns at John's intrusion is filled with an aching hurt, his blue eyes shadowed, and he's hunched in on himself, arms wrapped around his stomach as if Rodney is trying to protect against a blow. When John walks across to the balcony rail to join him, everything about Rodney's posture screams, 'go away, leave me alone', but he seems too tired to actually articulate the feeling. Taking that as a tacit agreement to his 
presence, John stays where he is, leaning back against the railing so that he can observe Rodney.

John doesn't need to ask what's affecting Rodney. He's now well aware exactly how Brendan Gaul died. John's not naive enough to think that there was ever a real chance of Gaul surviving, but he certainly wouldn't have anticipated him blowing his own brains out rather than waiting for the slow death caused by the Wraith's feeding. He doesn't know if Rodney honestly believed they'd be bringing Gaul back alive, but John's quite sure he wouldn't have expected this outcome either. 

The fact that Rodney put the gun in Gaul's hand in the first place can only have made things worse. God alone knows what Rodney must have felt when he turned around to see the results of Gaul's actions. John wouldn't wish that on his worst enemy and certainly not on the man who's unexpectedly become his best friend in the time that they've been here in Atlantis. 

There's no question that Rodney's changed, become stronger, since their arrival in the Pegasus galaxy, but what happened today would be enough to shock even a hardened military man, and Rodney's a long way from being one of those. Despite a few, desultory efforts at their usual banter, Rodney had been uncharacteristically quiet during the fifteen hour return flight to Atlantis and had followed it up with his rapid exit from the infirmary. John's not going to let him keep running, though.

He's sure that Rodney is already well on the way to working out how Gaul's death is his fault, when it's nothing of the kind. Gaul made his own choice, no matter what Rodney is currently telling himself. John's no stranger to guilt; he has plenty of ghosts of his own and not all of them followed him from his own galaxy. John knows what carrying them around in your head can do to you and he's not prepared to see Rodney wear that haunted look for any longer than necessary.

Today has been hell on both of them, but neither of them deserves to burn for what happened. Now John just needs to find the right words to convince Rodney of that. John can go back to figuring out how to deal with his own demons later.

Summary - Rodney decides that losing his mind might not be such a bad thing.
Author's notes - Just a little post Duet ficlet.

<lj-cut text=""CRAZY"">
Sheppard was sitting in a chair near his bed when Rodney opened his eyes again, taking in the all too familiar surroundings of the infirmary. Rodney blinked in surprise; he hadn't expected anyone to stay while he slept, not now that everything was back to normal. That made him think of Cadman and Rodney glanced over at the bed to his right. It was empty.

""Carson discharged her a couple of hours ago,"" Sheppard said in answer to the unspoken question. ""So, how are you feeling?""

Taking a quick mental inventory, Rodney nodded in approval. 

""I'm fine, feeling like myself again. Though I'm sure I'll feel even better when I can get out of here and back to my own quarters. These beds are hell on my back."" Rodney's voice hitched just a little as he recalled where he'd ended up the last time he'd fallen asleep in his own bed. At least he could be certain there wouldn't be any further embarrassing sleepwalking incidents.

Apparently, Sheppard had noticed his momentary discomfiture, because he was leaning forward, a worried frown creasing his forehead. ""Are you sure you're okay, Rodney? I can get Carson, if you like.""

Rodney shook his head, a sudden flush heating his cheeks. ""Trust me, Carson is the last person I want to see right now.""

Sheppard quirked a smile at him. ""Right, I guess things would be a bit weird between the two of you since, well, you know...""

""Believe me, I know only too well,"" Rodney said snappishly. ""And weird would be something of an understatement, Colonel.""

""But that was Cadman, right?"" Sheppard asked, his frown suddenly making an appearance again.

Rodney wished Sheppard would leave that particular subject alone. It wasn't something he cared to dwell on; especially since he'd discovered that Cadman had used his body to pay Carson a visit that Rodney had absolutely no memory of. Sheppard, however, was nothing if not persistent.

""I mean, you weren't the one who wanted to lay one on Carson, were you?"" he pressed.

""I don't know why you're so interested in what happened,"" Rodney said unhappily. ""But let me assure you, I personally had, and continue to have, no desire to kiss Carson. Is that what you wanted to hear?""

Apparently, it was. Rodney's answer seemed to make Sheppard relax and he nodded and smiled. ""Yeah, that's good, Rodney. It's all good.""

An unpleasant possibility crossed Rodney's mind and he fixed Sheppard with a sharp stare. ""I hope this isn't a case of military inspired homophobia coming to the fore, Colonel. I'd always thought better of you.""

Sheppard's eyes widened, a startled look crossing his face. The expression smoothed out into something that looked a lot like hurt.

""God, no! I thought you knew me better than that,"" he said finally.

""So did I,"" Rodney said with a shrug of his shoulders. ""But what else am I supposed to think when you just won't let this go?""

Sheppard didn't seem to have an answer and his eyes wouldn't meet Rodney's. He appeared to have developed a sudden fascination with the floor.

With a frown, Rodney reached out, impatiently tapping Sheppard's arm to bring his attention back to him. ""All right, this is ridiculous! Why exactly <i>are</i> you so concerned about whether it was me or Cadman who wanted to kiss Carson, then?""

Sheppard looked uncomfortable and, for a second, Rodney was sure he'd laugh it off and finally change the subject. Instead, to Rodney's surprise, Sheppard slid his chair closer to the bed, leaning in so that there was no chance of his words being overheard.

""Rodney, for a genius you can be damned unobservant sometimes,"" he said, scowling.

""Huh? What do you mean?"" Rodney stared at Sheppard, honestly puzzled.

""Jeez, I have no idea how you ever get a date,"" Sheppard muttered.

Rodney tried to protest that he'd managed to get a date with Katie Brown - although she'd actually asked him, but that was beside the point; as was the fact that the entire evening had been a disaster, which Rodney could only partially blame Cadman for - but Sheppard waved aside his attempt to speak.

""I can't believe you're making me say this, Rodney,"" Sheppard continued, with a sigh.

""What? Colonel, I may be a genius, but I really don't have the ability to read your mind... thank God!"" Rodney's voice came out sharp and too loud and Sheppard shushed him frantically.

""Okay,"" Sheppard said, taking a deep breath.

Rodney looked at him expectantly.

""It's just that..."" Sheppard hesitated again. ""If it was you who was in charge of the whole near-death, totally inappropriate PDAs situation, I kinda hoped it would, well, be me that you chose to kiss, not Carson.""

Rodney had never seen John Sheppard blush and it was... oddly endearing. And, God, he was obviously as insane as Sheppard clearly was, because if he were in his right mind he certainly wouldn't be using words like endearing to describe Sheppard. Rodney opened his mouth to tell Sheppard exactly how crazy he was, but nothing came out and there weren't many things that could leave Rodney McKay at a total loss for words, but apparently Sheppard had found one of them.

""Say something!"" Sheppard hissed as Rodney continued to sit and gape at him, doing his best impression of a fish out of water.

Eventually, Rodney shut his mouth with an audible snap. ""Are you completely out of your mind?""

The half-expectant, half-hopeful look faded from Sheppard's eyes in an instant and he hurriedly began to rise from the chair. ""I'm sorry, Rodney. I shouldn't have... I can't believe I actually...""

""What? Where are you going?"" Rodney grabbed Sheppard's wrist and tugged until he sat down again. ""You do <i>not</i> say something like that and then just walk away! Some of us need a little time to process a bombshell like that.""

""But you said I had to be out of my mind,"" Sheppard said, his brows drawing together as he looked across at Rodney. ""I know how to take a hint.""

Rodney sighed. ""I didn't mean it that way! I think you're crazy to say something like this <i>now</i>; when we have Caldwell and his cronies looking over our shoulders to remind us about 'don't ask, don't tell'.""

""Then you <i>didn't</i> mean..."" The hopeful look was back on Sheppard's face again as he waited for Rodney to elaborate.

""As much as it pains me to boost your ego, Colonel, I am not averse to the idea of kissing you,"" Rodney said with a hint of amusement in his voice. And maybe losing his mind wouldn't be so bad if he was in such good company. ""Though I must admit I'd always thought that my ass would make the acquaintance of the floor very quickly if I tried laying one on you, as you so quaintly put it.""

Sheppard's expression visibly brightened. ""So, it's something you've thought about?""

""Do you really want to have this conversation here?"" Rodney asked with a smirk.

""Maybe not,"" Sheppard conceded, shifting in his seat.

""Well then, if I can contain my embarrassment long enough for Carson to let me out of here, I'm sure we have a lot to talk about, Colonel,"" Rodney said with a smile.

""Stay right there!"" Sheppard pointed an imperious finger at him then hurriedly disappeared, presumably in search of Carson.

Settling back against his pillow, Rodney allowed his smile to grow. Cadman might not have done much for his love life where women were concerned, but for this Rodney definitely owed her a word of thanks.

Title - Quiet
Fandom - Stargate Atlantis
Characters/Pairing - Sheppard/McKay, Ronon
Rating - NC-17
Spoilers - Lost Boys

<lj-cut text=""QUIET"">
There's not much privacy here in Ford's little domain, not that it bothers Ronon. Years spent running from the Wraith notwithstanding, Ronon's a soldier and he's used to being in close quarters with his comrades. With the Wraith enzyme running through his veins like fire privacy means even less to him.

Ronon's sure Sheppard thinks he's keeping McKay quiet, but silence and the scientist just don't go together. Even at the best of times McKay is constantly talking; now he's under the enzyme's influence he babbles and whines more than ever. Not that there are many actual words in the sounds McKay is making at the moment, despite Sheppard's hand being clamped over his mouth to hold them in. The gasps and breathy moans coming from low in McKay's throat would give away what the two men are doing even if Ronon couldn't see around the inadequate curtain screening their room. But he can and he has no qualms about standing in the shadows just outside and watching them fuck.

McKay's been a mess of restless energy all day. The enzyme seems to exaggerate all his worst tendencies, in Ronon's opinion, making him a threat to their safety. Ronon saw Sheppard watching McKay as he worked on the dart, staying close and trying to keep him calm and focused. Now he's helping McKay to shed some of that pent up intensity in another way, understanding his team mate's needs in the way a good commander always does.

From the very beginning Ronon's felt the pull Sheppard exerts on him, but he's known without having to ask that Sheppard is already claimed. He's just never seen the overt proof of it before. Sheppard's people put such incomprehensible limitations on the enjoyment of sex, but here the rules no longer seem to matter.

Both men are naked and sweating, their clothing discarded haphazardly on the floor. McKay is sprawled across the disordered bedding with his arms stretched over his head. His hands are clenching and unclenching fitfully on empty air. Sheppard is straddling McKay, his thighs spread wide for balance as he rides him, and the long muscles in Sheppard's back tense and relax as he moves. Sheppard's leaning forward so that he can keep a hand over McKay's mouth, stopping him from waking the whole base with his cries.

From where he's standing Ronon has a perfect view of McKay's thick cock sliding in and out of Sheppard's body every time Sheppard rises up and then sinks back down. The sight makes Ronon's own cock swell and he reaches down to unfasten his pants. Then he shoves his hand inside and takes hold of himself, pumping in the same rhythm as Sheppard uses, moving on top of McKay.

McKay's muffled noises are getting steadily louder and more desperate, in spite of Sheppard's efforts. He's rocking up into Sheppard, fast and hard, and their bodies collide with bruising force. Sheppard's free hand is between them and Ronon knows he's jerking himself off, even though he can't see it. Sheppard is as silent in his pleasure as McKay is noisy, but Ronon can tell the moment Sheppard comes from the sudden tension in his back and the way his head drops forward as if it's become too heavy to hold up. 

Ronon can also imagine the way Sheppard's body is tightening around McKay's cock; he knows how that feels and he craves the sensation now. Ronon grips his cock harder, trying to capture that feeling for himself, but it's McKay's strangled moans as he comes that finally push Ronon over the edge. He spills over his hand, the semen hot and wet on his skin.

When Ronon's head clears he hurriedly tucks his cock back into his pants. Then he directs his attention to Sheppard and McKay again. Sheppard has pulled off of McKay's spent cock, but he's still slumped across the other man's stocky body. McKay has drawn his arms and legs around him, keeping Sheppard close. They're both asleep and they seem to have found peace in each other. For all that his body is sated for now, Ronon envies them that. Turning away, he strides along the corridor towards his own room and Teyla.

Summary - John likes to run. Ronon catches him.

<lj-cut text=""FRIENDLY COMPETITION"">
Atlantis had miles and miles of empty hallways, explored and declared safe, but not yet in regular use. As a result of his daily runs, John Sheppard felt as if he were getting to know most of them. He rather enjoyed the solitude they offered. It gave him a chance to think and clear his head and, in an odd way, it reminded him of his time in Antarctica.

Today, as he jogged back towards the inhabited areas of the city after his workout, John discovered that he wasn't the only one taking advantage of the maze of long corridors. The tall figure of Ronon Dex was unmistakable, approaching from the opposite direction. He stopped when he saw John.

""Sheppard,"" Ronon acknowledged when their paths crossed. ""You want some company?""

""I'm kinda used to running by myself,"" John replied. He wasn't sure he was ready to give up the brief period of alone time his run afforded him.

Ronon shrugged. ""Okay.""

Thinking that was the end of their conversation, John turned to continue on his way back to his quarters. However, he stopped in his tracks when Ronon spoke again, his tone deceptively bland.

""I guess you can't take the competition,"" Ronon said.

John narrowed his eyes as he spun round and looked up at Ronon. ""Are you saying I can't keep up with you?""

""You'll never know if you don't try,"" Ronon said, the barest hint of a smile on his face. ""But it makes me wonder, the way you send your men to train with me, but never spar with me yourself...""

""Fine, you're on,"" John retorted, pulling himself up to his full height. ""Let's see who makes it back to the transporter at the far end of this corridor first.""

""That's it?"" Ronon looked unimpressed. ""I thought you'd want more of a challenge.""

Privately, John thought that was more than enough of a challenge, given that he'd already run several miles this morning, but he decided against saying that to Ronon. After all, this was the guy who'd spent seven years running from the Wraith.

""I just thought I'd get a feel for the opposition first,"" John said finally.

Ronon cast a vaguely amused look in his direction. ""It's okay; I'll go easy on you this time.""

""Hey, don't do me any favours,"" John shot back.

""All right,"" Ronon agreed, far too easily for John's liking.

Then, without further warning, Ronon set off at a run in the direction of their goal.

""Damn it!"" John muttered and chased after Ronon as fast as he could.

It quickly became apparent that John had no chance of catching Ronon. He was fast and lighter on his feet than his size would have suggested. By the time John reached the transporter, Ronon was leaning casually against the wall, waiting for him. He'd barely broken a sweat. John, on the other hand, was out of breath and his T-shirt was damp where it stuck to his skin.

""Nice work,"" John panted as he bent over, hands braced on his thighs. It was hard work just trying to breathe normally. ""Next time... Next time I'll be ready for you.""

""You need more practice,"" Ronon said as he pushed away from the wall.

""You think so?"" John said wryly as he straightened up and scrubbed a hand across his face. He was hot and sticky and he really needed a shower. ""I guess I'm more used to flying places, not running there.""

""I could tell."" The thread of amusement was still evident in Ronon's voice. ""Though you run better than McKay.""

John raised his eyebrows. ""I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not.""

""Probably not,"" Ronon deadpanned. He gave a deep, throaty laugh when John glared at him.

""I think I'll quit now and go hit the showers,"" John said. ""Before I completely lose my credibility as your team leader.""

He turned to open the transporter and was startled when a hand landed on his shoulder. Ronon spun him back around and then John found himself pushed up against the wall with Ronon in his face, totally ignoring the concept of personal space.

""Hey!"" John protested.

""You lead the team just fine,"" Ronon said with conviction. ""I'm quite willing to follow you.""

""Well, that's good to know,"" John drawled, still eyeing Ronon a little warily. ""And now I really should be..."" He stopped abruptly when Ronon leaned in and nuzzled at his throat, then rasped his tongue across the sweaty skin. ""Ronon?""

""You smell good,"" Ronon growled, as if that explained everything. ""Taste good too.""

""Ah - okay."" John went very still, definitely not sure that it was any kind of explanation. 

Regardless, he found himself trying to ignore the way his cock was stiffening in response, pushing at the front of his sweatpants. This was - unexpected to say the least. John had thought that Ronon had his eye on Teyla, not on him.

""You have a problem with this?"" Ronon asked as he drew a hand slowly down John's chest. Broad fingertips circled John's nipples through the damp, clinging fabric of his T-shirt.

John opened his mouth to say that, yes, he did have a problem with it and that they couldn't do this. So, he was somewhat surprised when what came out was, ""No. No I don't.""

Ronon gave a rumble of approval, deep in his throat. ""Good.""

Apparently, that was all Ronon intended to say on the subject, because then he simply pressed John more firmly against the wall. He slid a leg between both of John's, his thigh rubbing John's cock through his pants. At the same time, Ronon's hand burrowed underneath John's shirt, clearly intent on finding bare skin to touch.

John choked off a groan of pleasure as Ronon's fingers traced patterns on his stomach and then moved up to tease his nipples some more. A small, dutiful voice in the back of his head told John that he really needed to put a stop to this. Right. Now. But then Ronon's mouth resumed its exploration of his neck, the rough tickle of his beard making John moan, and John decided that sometimes duty was seriously overrated.

He would freak out about how it might affect team dynamics, the implications of 'don't ask, don't tell' and any other reason why they shouldn't be doing this some other time. At this very second, John wanted heat, pressure, friction... God! Yes, he wanted Ronon to keep biting and sucking at his throat. He needed Ronon to carry on rocking into him, the hard muscle of his thigh pushing against John's swollen cock in just the right way.

With an effort, John managed to work one hand down the back of Ronon's pants, sliding his fingers between the cheeks of his ass to tease Ronon in return. Ronon seemed to approve of the gesture if the low grunt he gave was any sign. He continued rubbing against John and John could feel Ronon's cock, hard where it pressed into his hip as they moved together. Reaching up, John curved his other hand around the back of Ronon's neck, his fingers tangling in the coarse hair.

There was no finesse to what they were doing, but it felt like it was exactly what John needed, and Ronon too, it appeared. The simple, visceral pleasure of it, just trying to get each other off, quickly pushed both of them to the brink.

Ronon's hands suddenly tightened their grip and John knew he'd have marks to remember this by. He grabbed Ronon's ass harder and pulled him in close, grinding against the thick cock he could feel riding his hip. Then Ronon tore his mouth away from John's neck and threw his head back with a groan. John thrust faster and was rewarded when Ronon began to shudder, cursing loudly as he came hard.

The sharp scent of sex rising from Ronon's skin and the added pressure as he bucked against John was enough to trigger John's orgasm too. Pinned between Ronon and the wall he couldn't move much, but he shivered as the sensations rolled over him, bright and intense. Gasping for breath, John clutched at Ronon's body as he came in his pants. It felt like it was the best thing in the Pegasus galaxy.

By the time John was starting to come down from the endorphin high, Ronon was slumped heavily against him. Ronon was panting in a way he hadn't from the earlier physical exertion. John carefully eased his hand out of Ronon's pants and pushed at him until he took his own weight.

Ronon stretched slowly, the movement doing interesting things to his muscles that John couldn't quite stop himself from watching. John wondered when he was going to reach the freaking out stage of the whole experience, apparently, not just yet.

A lazy grin spread across Ronon's face, as he seemed to realise just how focused on him John was. ""Guess we both need a shower now.""

Looking up, John met Ronon's gaze.

""I guess we do,"" he agreed.

Ronon's grin turned sly. ""Race you...""

<lj-cut text=""EVEN ON THE WORST DAYS"">
Rodney is close to comatose by the time he feels a warm hand land heavily on his shoulder, spinning his chair away from the open laptop on the bench. If he had the energy left he'd complain, but it's officially been the day from hell and he's got nothing. He was dragged out of his bed at some ungodly hour of the morning when the city's power grid went haywire and he's barely stopped to draw breath since.

A steady supply of coffee and sandwiches have been appearing as if by magic during the day to keep him going, but Rodney hasn't taken the time to wonder where they came from. He's just grabbed a bite or a drink in passing before diving back into the intricacies of the necessary repairs. At this stage, the caffeine doesn't seem to be doing the trick any more, though.

Looking blearily around the lab, Rodney realises it's empty apart from himself and the man whose hand is still gripping his shoulder.

""Colonel?"" he queries vaguely.

""Jesus, Rodney!"" John gives him a little shake and Rodney's head lolls forward tiredly. ""What are you still doing here at this hour?""

""Making sure the city continues to have power,"" Rodney snaps, slanting a sideways glance at John. His heart really isn't in it, though, and the words fade out into a yawn.

""The power grid is running just fine now."" John frowns at him. ""That's why everyone else is in bed.""

""Except you,"" Rodney points out. He waves his hand vaguely in the direction of his laptop. ""Anyway, I'm monitoring it for fluctuations.""

""Bed, Rodney!"" John insists. ""If there's another problem someone will call you.""

For a second Rodney's torn, but he knows John's right and, as much as he hates to concede, he's too damned tired to argue with him.

""Fine!"" he says finally, reaching to power down the computer. ""Fine.""

John pats Rodney's shoulder in approval and then prods him until he drags himself out of his chair. Rodney groans as his back muscles spasm in protest at the number of hours he's spent hunched over his desk. He stretches, hearing his joints crack, and then slowly heads for the door. John sticks as close as his shadow as they make their way to the nearest transporter, presumably to ensure Rodney doesn't try to sneak back into the lab when he's not looking.

The corridors are empty this late at night and when Rodney thinks open the door to his quarters, John follows him inside without hesitation. 

The lights come up just a little and Rodney considers falling into bed fully clothed. He's tired enough not to care about getting undressed, but he's also aware of just how knotted up his muscles are. If he goes to sleep like this, Rodney knows he'll pay for it in the morning. He won't be able to move.

John is leaning against the wall, watching him thoughtfully, as if he's aware of Rodney's dilemma. Suddenly, he pushes himself upright and moves across to Rodney, catching hold of his arm and steering him towards the bathroom.

""I think a nice hot shower is in order,"" John says firmly.

Grateful that any decision-making has been taken out of his hands, Rodney nods his agreement. He begins to strip out of his clothes while John turns on the shower. By the time Rodney's naked, steam is curling through the bathroom and he groans in anticipation. He steps into the shower stall and lifts his face into the perfectly heated spray of water. The shock of it hitting his skin is enough to disperse the fog of tiredness just a little and he smiles as John slips into the space behind him.

With warm, bare skin pressing against his back and hot water beating down on his chest, Rodney feels the stress of the day begin to sluice off of him along with the sweat and dust accumulated while he spent his time crawling under more than one Ancient console, working without a break. He sighs as he leans back into John, soaking up the wiry strength that supports him. The slight change in position leaves John's cock resting in the crack of his ass and Rodney can't quite resist rubbing against it.

There's a soft huff of laughter close by his ear. ""Is this your way of telling me that you want something?""

""I've had a long day; I think the least you could do is help me wash,"" Rodney says airily.

He knows John enjoys touching him and Rodney likes the way John touches him. It's a win win situation and Rodney's absolutely certain he'll be a lot more relaxed and ready for sleep by the time John's done.

""What did your last body slave die of,"" John grumbles good-naturedly, but he's already reaching for the soap and carefully turning them both so that the spray gets them thoroughly wet.

John's hands are strong and quite assiduous in their task of lathering up every inch of Rodney's body. Rodney's already on the verge of melting into a boneless heap by the time John slides down onto his knees, his fingers beginning to massage Rodney's buttocks and thighs. When John manoeuvres him so that he's leaning back against the cool tile wall Rodney really needs the support, because his legs feel like jelly. 

Unlike his cock, which is enjoying the proceedings far too much considering just how exhausted Rodney is. John tilts his head up, flashing him a quick grin as he wraps his hand around it and starts to stroke just the way Rodney likes it.

Rodney manages an appreciative moan, but he's beyond anything more coherent at the moment. John's other hand is wandering further afield, trailing soapy fingers up to pinch Rodney's nipples. They're predictably sensitive, quickly tightening into hard buds and Rodney arches into the touch. John's hand skates away again, this time skimming down across the soft flesh of Rodney's belly, which just makes him shiver.

Leaning back, John lets the full force of the shower spray hit Rodney for a few seconds; long enough to wash away the remaining lather. When Rodney's skin is slick and clean he moves in close again and now his mouth joins his hands in tracing out the contours of Rodney's body.

As tired as he is, Rodney's hips still jerk in response. His cock slides against John's stubbled cheek and the rough rasp sends a jolt through him. He tips his head back, banging it on the wall behind him.

""Fuck!"" he hisses as John rubs his face against him, deliberately this time.

""You have a dirty mouth, Rodney,"" John says with a snort of laughter.

""I haven't heard you complaining,"" Rodney gasps as John nuzzles his hip and stomach lazily, licking up the drops of water beading on his skin. ""And speaking of mouths, are you sure you wouldn't care to do something more constructive with yours?""

""Pushy bastard,"" John says affectionately before leaning in to slide his mouth over the head of Rodney's cock, sucking hard.

Rodney makes an odd, strangled sound and grabs for John's water flattened hair, digging his fingers into it and urging John's head down further. 

John seems to take the suggestion with good grace and sucks more of Rodney's cock in, his lips tight on the slick flesh. While his mouth is occupied with Rodney's cock, John's hands slip behind Rodney's balls, fingers pressing in until Rodney thrusts forward with a notable lack of control. John apparently takes that as a signal to slide them further back, up between Rodney's ass cheeks. He circles Rodney's hole with the blunt tip of one finger, not trying to get inside, but still teasing enough to make Rodney pant and curse inventively.

Torn between trying to thrust his cock deeper into John's throat or getting that thick finger into his ass, Rodney ends up managing neither. Instead, the combined sensations spiral out of control and Rodney finds himself coming in a heated rush that leaves his head spinning and his knees buckling under him. John just keeps sucking his cock until Rodney's got nothing left to give, only then letting him slip out of his mouth.

While Rodney's still in the non-verbal stage of post-coital, John scrambles up off the floor of the shower, plastering his long, rangy body against Rodney's. When his brain comes back on line, Rodney's intimately aware of John's lips covering his while John's tongue insinuates itself into Rodney's mouth. Rodney's not at all averse to being kissed by John, even with the taste of his own come sharp on John's tongue.

He's even more on board with the way that John's rubbing himself off against him, the hard, slick length of his cock trapped between their stomachs. Rodney has enough presence of mind to grab a handful of John's ass and pull him in closer and that's all it takes to make John come as well, spurting hot and sticky between them. John throws his head back, his teeth raking across Rodney's bottom lip as he breaks their kiss. His hips jerk a few more times and then he slumps against Rodney, breathing hard.

For a long moment they remain wrapped around one another, holding each other up, while the hot water continues to pound down on them. Eventually, John takes his own weight and Rodney pushes away from the wall so that they can both clean the residual stickiness off their skin.

John shoots Rodney a crooked grin as he thinks the shower off and reaches up to push his fingers through his wet hair. ""Someone looks much more relaxed now.""

""Don't sound so smug,"" Rodney says as he grabs a towel and tosses a second one at John. ""You already know how good you are at that so you don't need your ego stroked any more.""

""I can think of a few other things you could stroke instead,"" John says with a leer.

Rodney gives a snort of disgust. ""Think again, some of us need to sleep so that we can, you know, keep the city running. Besides, not all of us entertain delusions of having the refractory period of a teenager."" 

As if to illustrate his point Rodney yawns, scrubbing a hand across his face.

John nudges him with his shoulder, smirking. ""It's okay, Rodney. I'll still love you even if you are old and decrepit.""

""Oh, thank you, I feel so lucky."" Rodney levels a narrow-eyed glare at John that loses something of its effectiveness when he yawns again.

John's lips twitch, threatening another smirk, but he buries his face in the towel before Rodney can complain about it.

Turning his back on John, Rodney swipes his own towel across his body a few more times and then throws it carelessly into the corner. Tiredness is rapidly catching up with him again and Rodney really does feel relaxed enough to sleep now.

""If you can refrain from any more ageist comments you can stay,"" Rodney says as he heads for his bed.

He hears the sound of another wet towel hitting tile and then there are warm, slightly damp arms sliding around his waist from behind.

""I can do that,"" John says, his breath hot on the back of Rodney's neck.

And when John's lips graze the soft skin at his nape, Rodney discovers that both of them have more stamina than he's given them credit for.

Fandom - Stargate Atlantis
Characters - John, Rodney and brief appearances by Teyla and Ronon
Disclaimer - Stargate Atlantis and its characters belong to a lot of people who aren't me.
Summary - A deserted planet, energy readings, Ancient ruins... of course it's not as simple as it seems.
Author's notes - Written for <lj user=""slodwick"">'s Worst-Case Scenario Challenge, my scenario was <a href=""http://yavanna.slashcity.net/worstcse.jpg"">How to untangle Christmas tree lights</a>. With huge thanks to <lj user=""astrea9562""> for the last minute beta.

<lj-cut text=""KNOT A PROBLEM"">
The problem with exploring a deserted planet with enticing energy readings and what looked like the ruins of an Ancient outpost was that nothing was ever as simple as it appeared to be at first glance.

Naturally, whatever was giving off the energy readings also created some kind of interference, which meant that their headsets only worked at close range. That might not have mattered, if Teyla and Ronon hadn't been checking out the far side of the abandoned native village when Rodney ventured into a promising looking building, Sheppard following close behind him, and promptly triggered the locals' equivalent of an intruder alarm.

He thought it was some kind of web when his hand first brushed against it, so Rodney simply tried to push it out of his way, suppressing a shudder of distaste. His efforts resulted in an ominous snapping sound and he hesitated for a moment, looking around for the source of the noise.

Abruptly, Sheppard's hand was splayed across the small of his back, shoving him forwards. Rodney stumbled, opening his mouth to voice a complaint, but the words died in his throat as he suddenly found himself entangled in what appeared to be some kind of net. As he lost his balance and fell heavily onto the floor, Rodney managed to twist round far enough to see that Sheppard was similarly caught.

""Crap!"" Sheppard hissed as he lost his fight with gravity and landed on his ass next to Rodney. ""Ow!""

""Well, isn't this nice,"" Rodney said caustically, once he'd dragged some air back into his lungs.

""Why the hell did you just stand there?"" Sheppard complained as he gingerly pushed himself up into a sitting position.

Rodney glared at him. ""I didn't know we'd just stepped into the real life version of one of your bondage fantasies.""

Perhaps wisely, Sheppard chose to ignore that comment. Instead, he turned his attention to the mess of ropes he was trapped in. Rodney let it go, opting to begin his own investigation. The net looked fairly primitive. In fact, it seemed more like a loose jumble of intertwined strands than anything as sophisticated as an actual net.

""I'm guessing this wasn't the Ancients' defence system,"" Rodney said snidely as he carefully levered himself upright.

Sheppard merely snorted and when Rodney glanced across at him he saw that Sheppard had managed to work one of his hands free. With a little more judicious wriggling, Sheppard was able to reach around, also freeing his knife.

""Come on, come on!"" Rodney barely restrained his impatience as he watched Sheppard press the blade against the nearest piece of rope. ""Hurry up, I think I'm starting to lose all feeling in my arms.""

""Shut up, McKay, just wait your turn,"" Sheppard retorted good-naturedly. But suddenly his expression changed, his mouth turning down in a frown. ""What the hell?""

""What? What's the problem?"" Rodney asked, leaning forward to try and see what Sheppard was doing.

""My knife doesn't seem to be able to cut though this stuff,"" Sheppard informed him. ""<i>That's</i> the problem.""

""That's ridiculous,"" Rodney insisted. ""Are you sure you've kept your knife properly sharpened? These ropes don't look very strong.""

""The knife's plenty sharp,"" Sheppard snapped, patience finally worn thin. ""And apparently appearances are deceptive, because they have some kind of core that I can't cut through. Also, if you hadn't noticed, the more you struggle the tighter they get.""

Rodney, who had been tugging ineffectually at his own bonds, stopped abruptly when he realised Sheppard was right. The ropes had now pulled appreciably tighter round his body, taking up most of the slack he'd had to start with. ""Oh God, it's going to cut off my circulation completely; or else I won't be able to breathe... Wait! Can you get at your P90? Maybe you could shoot this stuff off of us.""

Turning his head, Sheppard gave him a disbelieving look. ""Rodney, do you really want to lose a few body parts in the attempt? Because I have to say I'm not real keen on the idea.""

""What? Oh."" 

As he considered the situation a little more, Rodney was forced to concede that Sheppard was probably right, given the way that the ropes were tangled around them. Rodney liked all his body parts right where they were, so shooting was out. 

He slumped down fatalistically. ""You're right. How could I have had such a stupid idea? Oh no, my brain is probably already being deprived of oxygen...""

""Rodney!"" Sheppard interrupted him with obvious irritation. ""There's nothing wrong with your brain, well, nothing more than usual anyway."" He ploughed on, ignoring the indignant look Rodney gave him at that. ""So, I need you to stop panicking and just sit still so that these ropes don't get any tighter.""

""That's easy for you to say,"" Rodney muttered. ""It's not your brain that's losing IQ points by the second.""

Sheppard shot him a quelling stare and Rodney reluctantly subsided.

""That's better,"" Sheppard said with satisfaction. ""Now, I'm just going to try and get my other hand free and then I'll see what I can do about untangling this mess.""

""You make it sound so simple,"" Rodney sniped.

""Sure it is,"" Sheppard said easily. ""It'll be just like sorting out a string of Christmas tree lights. You know how they always seem to get tangled up in the box, no matter how carefully you put them away.""

Rodney blinked, nonplussed. ""Christmas tree lights? You're comparing a life or death situation to unravelling Christmas tree lights?"" His voice began to rise in both pitch and volume. ""Okay, maybe it's <i>your</i> brain that's been starved of oxygen. I never heard anything so stupid. God, we really are screwed!""

""Say what you like,"" Sheppard said. ""But there's a technique to it and I'm pretty sure it'll work on these ropes too.""

""And you, of course, are well versed in this <i>technique</i>,"" Rodney said, managing to make it sound like a dirty word. ""I can see how that would be an invaluable skill for an Air Force pilot.""

Sheppard's dark brows rose as his gaze calmly encompassed their current predicament.

""Be nice, Rodney,"" he said with just an edge of sharpness in his voice. ""That particular skill is what's going to get us out of here.""

""I don't do nice,"" Rodney informed Sheppard with a disdainful sniff. He tilted his head, setting his chin pugnaciously. ""But fine, you play at untangling your Christmas tree lights while I actually try to, you know, think of a way of getting us free.""

""You do that,"" Sheppard agreed placidly as his fingers slowly and carefully began to work at the knots and strands that bound him.

""I will,"" Rodney snapped back ungraciously. Though he had to admit that he was coming up a little short on ideas.

His eyes slid back to Sheppard's fingers, following their movements as they cautiously pulled at the ropes, loosening and unthreading the tangles bit by bit. It was unexpectedly distracting to watch and oddly soothing. 

Rodney sighed, wondering why these things always seemed to happen to him. And why hadn't Teyla and Ronon figured out that they were in trouble yet and come to rescue them? Although, the chances were that they'd just stumble into the same trap that he and Sheppard had. Then they could all indulge their bondage fantasies together, as if being tied up and collared hadn't been enough.

Another sigh and Sheppard glanced across at him. ""No grand escape plan yet, Rodney?""

Rodney ground his teeth together at the smug tone of Sheppard's voice. ""Just shut up and keep untangling, Colonel, and it'll be a very merry Christmas, I'm sure.""

Chuckling softly, Sheppard turned his attention back to the task at hand.

""Though I'd just as soon not be trussed up like the Christmas turkey,"" Rodney added, under his breath.

Despite Rodney's scepticism, a mere twenty minutes later, Sheppard finally succeeded in getting himself free. What had once appeared to be a net had now been reduced to a heap of individual strands of rope lying around him on the floor.

In the same time, Rodney had failed to make any real progress on escaping from his own bonds, a fact which caused Sheppard to grin smugly as he moved across to help him. Sheppard had barely made a start when his headset began to spit static, which quickly resolved into Teyla's anxious voice. Evidently, Teyla and Ronon were now close enough to their position to overcome the effects of the interference.

Sheppard quickly gave their teammates directions to the building they were located in, together with warnings about the problem they'd encountered. However, it seemed that only one trap had been set, which he and Rodney had already sprung.

Teyla's expression was amused as she took in the sight of Rodney, still tightly wrapped in a cocoon of ropes.

""It would appear, Colonel, that you and Dr. McKay have had a more interesting time than Ronon and I,"" she said, her lips twitching in an obvious effort not to laugh.

""Yeah, we got a little tied up,"" Sheppard agreed with a grin.

""Yes, yes, this is all very funny I'm sure and no doubt we'll all have a good laugh about it once we're back in Atlantis, but right now some of us are <i>still tied up</i>,"" Rodney snapped in annoyance.

Sheppard turned to look at him, pursing his lips thoughtfully. ""You know, Rodney, we have no idea if there are other booby traps just waiting for us to set them off. I think it would be much safer if we headed back to the jumper first and then worked on getting you untied.""

Rodney's eyes widened in disbelief. ""I hate to point out the flaw in this worthy scheme, Colonel.""

""Oh, yeah, but I think we can work around that,"" Sheppard said easily. ""Ronon?""

Ronon glanced from Sheppard to Rodney and back again, then nodded. The same hint of amusement that had coloured Teyla's expression passed across his face. ""No problem.""

""What? No!"" Rodney's voice rose in pitch as Ronon bent down and unceremoniously lifted him, settling him face down over his shoulder.

""Perfect,"" Sheppard said with a smirk. ""Now, let's get out of here.""

""Perfect?"" Rodney squawked, glaring at Sheppard as best he could from his current vantage point. ""This doesn't even come close to perfect!"" He struggled, but Ronon just gripped him more firmly. ""Put me down, you oaf!""

""That's not very friendly,"" Sheppard said as he led the way out of the deserted village. ""Maybe you should consider being a little nicer.""

""Why?"" Rodney complained somewhat breathlessly. ""I already told you I don't do nice and I can see no reason to start now. I'm upside down and being carried like a sack of potatoes for God's sake!""

""Remember those Christmas tree lights, Rodney,"" Sheppard said, sounding far too pleased with himself. ""I have the technique...""

""Of course you do,"" Rodney sighed.

""On the other hand,"" Sheppard continued. ""I could always leave you trussed up like that until we get back through the gate. I'm sure Zelenka would figure out how to get you untied... eventually.""

Rodney muttered a muffled curse and then fell silent. He knew Sheppard would do it, if provoked, and there was no way Rodney would ever live it down if Zelenka or any of the other scientists saw him like this.

""What was that, Rodney?"" Sheppard asked, far too innocently.

""Fine,"" Rodney said shortly. ""I said that's just fine."" He twisted, trying to peer round Ronon to see if they were anywhere near the jumper. ""Are we there yet?""

Teyla laughed and Sheppard stopped to glare at him in exasperation. ""Rodney...""

<lj-cut text=""SILENCE IS GOLDEN"">
As the door slid shut behind Beckett, Rodney reached round and fluffed his pillow before settling back against it. Once he was comfortable, Rodney glared at John who continued to hover at the end of his bed. The look Rodney gave him plainly said, 'I warned you about my allergies, but did you ever listen? No.'

When it became apparent that Rodney expected him to say <i>something</i>, John sighed in resignation. ""How was I supposed to know a field of grass was going to give you some kind of weird alien hay fever?""

""I started sneezing as soon as we went through the gate,"" Rodney retorted snappishly. ""Didn't that seem the least bit odd to you, or set any alarm bells ringing? Also, it's hardly hay fever, Colonel. My sinuses may never be the same again. And did I mention the residual dizziness and nausea?""

Before John had the chance to point out that Beckett had shot him full of enough antihistamines to quell the most virulent allergic reaction, Rodney began to sniff noisily. Then he reached to grab a distinctly unsavoury looking wad of tissues and proceeded to blow his nose, even more loudly.

John pulled a face as he watched Rodney deposit the soggy tissues in the trash with a final snuffle.

""You're lacking a certain charm here, Rodney,"" he said with another grimace.

""I'm sick; I shouldn't have to be charming as well,"" Rodney said dismissively. ""Besides, charm is your strong suit, not mine.""

""Well, if that's how you feel, maybe I should go and be charming somewhere else,"" John sniped. ""Somewhere my efforts will be appreciated.""

""You do that,"" Rodney agreed, reaching for fresh tissues. ""I'll just lie here and suffer in silence.""

John raised his eyebrows and gave a snort of disbelief.

""What?"" Rodney narrowed his eyes. ""Are you doubting the fact that I'm suffering here?""

""Of course not, Rodney,"" John said, biting his lip to keep from saying anything more.

""I'm sensing a definite lack of sympathy for my plight,"" Rodney complained, jabbing a finger towards John in emphasis.

""Actually,"" John said, before he could think better of it. ""It's more that I was doubting your ability to do anything in silence.""

As he glared up at John, Rodney's mouth automatically opened to refute the claim and John didn't bother trying to control his 'I told you so' smirk. It was, therefore, something of a surprise when Rodney closed his mouth again with an audible snap, not a word coming from him. Then, folding his arms across his chest, Rodney gave John a resolute stare.

Taking the few steps required to bring him to the side of Rodney's bed, John seated himself on the edge. He eyed the other man curiously. ""Is that a challenge, Rodney?""

Instead of answering, Rodney simply tilted his head, his chin coming up in a familiar gesture of determination.

John gave Rodney a calculating look. This could be entertaining. ""All right, let's make this more interesting. If you can keep totally silent for the next hour I'll let you have one of the packs of coffee the Daedalus brought on its last supply run. And I'm talking the good stuff here, Rodney, none of that instant crap.""

His eyes lighting up avariciously, Rodney nodded eagerly.

""Okay,"" John continued. ""If you fail, you share that stash of chocolate bars I know you've been hoarding with me. Deal?""

Rodney looked torn for a moment, but another nod signalled his agreement.

""So, not a word from you for the next hour,"" John repeated, checking his watch. Then he leaned forward, grinning, and added, ""Not a moan or a whimper either, no sound at all.""

Setting his lips in a tight line, Rodney nodded again.

""Great!"" John said brightly. Then, without warning, he stood up and quickly began shucking his clothes.

Rodney's mouth dropped open as he stared at John's impromptu striptease and it was obvious that he was dying to say something. John merely waggled a finger at him in disapproval and Rodney subsided, shooting a murderous look at John.

Once he was naked, John slid back onto the bed, nudging Rodney with his hip until he moved over to make room for him.

""By the way,"" John said, deciding he could afford to be magnanimous. He stretched and wiggled until he was comfortable. ""I won't count sniffing or sneezing against you, on account of the whole alien hay fever thing, but, that's it. Anything else and you lose.""

With that clarification out of the way, John reached down and wrapped a hand round his cock. Totally ignoring the man beside him, John began to jerk himself off, fully aware of the effect that always had on Rodney. At first he was quiet about it, but as his cock stiffened in his hand, John began to breathe harder and moan softly in the back of his throat.

Feeling Rodney tense up, John glanced across at him. Rodney was watching the movement of his hand avidly. He was also biting his lip hard. John twisted his wrist so that he could see his watch. It was barely five minutes into the challenge. There was no way that Rodney would last a whole hour. Grinning to himself, John turned his attention back to the glide of his fingers along his cock.

Suddenly, John felt a touch on his arm. Rodney's hand was a warm weight on his skin, sliding down until it covered his and pulling it away from his cock. John gave Rodney a quizzical look as he pushed John's hand firmly down onto the mattress at his side. Then Rodney moved, quickly straddling John's thighs.

John drew in a sharp breath as Rodney scooted backwards, making it quite clear what he intended to do. Well, he hadn't said that Rodney couldn't touch, had he? And John certainly wasn't inclined to turn down a blow job from him. Though he couldn't help feeling that it was, somehow, cheating if Rodney found other ways to occupy his mouth than talking.

Before John could voice the thought, Rodney leaned forward and went down on him. John's hips bucked up off the bed at the sudden sensation of heat and warmth around his cock and his head fell back, banging against the wall.

""Jesus, Rodney!"" John gasped as Rodney did positively obscene things with his tongue.

As soon as John spoke, Rodney pulled off and levelled a disapproving stare at him.

""Hey, that wasn't in the rules!"" John protested as he realised what Rodney wanted.

Rodney simply kept on glaring at him, making no effort to resume the blow job. Eventually, John sighed and nodded his agreement to the revised terms of the challenge. If Rodney wanted him to keep silent as well, that would be no problem at all.

Looking pleased with himself, Rodney reached up and ran his thumb smoothly across John's lips. John nipped at the fleshy pad with his teeth in retaliation and felt the abrupt tension as Rodney had to swallow his instinctive complaint. It was John's turn to smirk as Rodney hurriedly pulled his hand away.

He wasn't feeling quite so smug when Rodney took the scenic route back down to his groin. John clenched his hands into fists, digging his nails into his palms, as Rodney slowly licked his way down John's throat, pausing to suck marks into the skin here and there. When Rodney then detoured to first one nipple, then the other, sucking and biting until they were both standing to attention, John had to squeeze his eyes shut to block out the sight.

Rodney finally resumed his downward path, his tongue swirling through the trail of dark curls on John's stomach. John felt the head of his cock bump against the underside of Rodney's chin, the rasp of stubble on too sensitive flesh leaving him biting back a groan.

Then John's cock was being drawn back into wet heat as Rodney started to suck him hard. Strong fingers wrapped around the base, stroking firmly and, abruptly, it struck John as being entirely unfair that he was the only one who was naked. It had to give Rodney an advantage over him.

Opening his eyes again, John reached down and dug his fingers into Rodney's short hair, tugging until he raised his head.

Rodney looked annoyed by the interruption until John pulled at the hem of his shirt, indicating that he wanted it off. Rodney considered for a moment and then gave a quick nod. A stabbing motion with his hand clearly conveyed that he expected John to stay exactly where he was. Then Rodney climbed off the bed and stripped with brisk efficiency.

As far as John was concerned it never got old, seeing Rodney naked. He made a point of looking his fill as Rodney bent and stretched, getting out of his clothes. John particularly appreciated the sight of Rodney's bare ass as well as the thick cock that was every bit as hard as his own. Rodney might have complained about being sick, but that wasn't stopping him from enjoying their game.

When Rodney clambered back over him, John had to remind himself not to make a sound. Especially when Rodney resumed his self-appointed task of sucking John's brains out through his cock.

Now that he had bare skin to play with, John concentrated on touching as much of Rodney as he could reach. His hands stroked the soft spot at the nape of Rodney's neck that always made him shudder and moan. Then John smoothed his fingers across the broad shoulders and down Rodney's arms in a steady caress. John also moved his legs as much as he was able to with Rodney straddling them. He wanted to cause as much friction as he could against the inside of Rodney's thighs and the tender skin behind his balls.

Rodney clearly knew what John was trying to do and he skimmed his hands lightly down John's sides, easily finding all his ticklish spots. John squirmed and dug his teeth into his bottom lip. 

When Rodney pulled off of his cock and looked up at him with a smirk, John narrowed his eyes in an indignant glare. He wanted to protest about Rodney's dirty tricks and about the fact that he wasn't sucking him any more, but John couldn't do either without forfeiting the challenge. Then Rodney's hand took over where his mouth had left off and John was so close that he could feel the heat building low in his belly.

Rodney didn't look away for a second, watching John's face intently and John stared right back, not giving an inch.

Then Rodney slid his free hand between John's thighs, fingers pressing in just the right place behind his balls, and it was all over. John came hard, semen spilling onto his stomach as Rodney kept stroking him, wringing every shivering spasm out of him that he could.

When Rodney's touch became too much for his over-sensitised skin, John grabbed him by the shoulders and hauled him up against his body. Rodney flailed for balance for a second before falling against John's chest. John stroked his hands down Rodney's back before curving them around his ass, urging Rodney to thrust against him. Rodney didn't need much encouragement and his cock slid through the sticky mess on John's stomach with each jerky thrust.

Burying his face in John's neck, Rodney absently mouthed the sweaty skin. John took advantage of his distraction, quickly sucking a finger into his mouth, getting it good and slick. Then his hand was back on Rodney's ass, the wet finger pushing between his cheeks and circling his hole.

Rodney jumped like a scalded cat at the unexpected touch, but to John's amazement he managed to bite down on any sound. A second later Rodney was also biting down on John's shoulder, firmly enough to bruise, as the finger sliding into his ass finally pushed him over the edge. If Rodney did make any sound as he came, it was drowned out by John's indignant yelp of pain as Rodney's teeth clamped down harder.

Instantly, Rodney's head shot up and he managed the tricky feat of looking insufferably smug as he shuddered through his orgasm, still in stubborn silence.

Slumping heavily back against John as post-coital lassitude took hold of him, Rodney still managed to crow in delight, ""You owe me coffee!""

""Ow, Rodney, did you have to bite me quite so hard?"" John protested, reaching up to rub his abused shoulder.

""Don't complain, you're the one who started the dirty tricks when you stripped off and began indulging your fetish for exhibitionism. Did you really think I'd just sit there in silence and let you get away with that? Oh, that's right, I wasn't allowed to talk at the time so pardon me for not warning you that I intended to play dirty too."" Rodney still looked inordinately pleased with himself as he added, ""Admit it, you didn't think I could do it, did you?""

John gave him the evil eye. ""I still think you cheated. You'd have been yelling your head off if you hadn't bitten me.""

""You're just a sore loser,"" Rodney said as he pushed himself upright. ""Besides, I hardly think you can claim the moral high ground when you were prepared to take advantage of a sick man.""

John shook his head. ""I was never going to win this, was I?""

""Never bet against the genius,"" Rodney said, patting John's arm condescendingly. Then he reached for the tissues on his nightstand and sneezed loudly.

Title - Persuasion
Pairing - SGA: John/Rodney
Rating - R

<lj-cut>John's running out of ideas, wondering exactly what it will take to get Rodney out of his lab tonight. He's tried the promise of food or coffee, but neither made Rodney raise his head for more than a moment or two before the lure of the information on the screen in front of him recaptured Rodney's attention again. When he gets this caught up in something, Rodney's focus is startlingly intent.

A sudden thought crosses his mind and John concentrates for the second it takes to lock the door.

When Rodney looks up again, he doesn't turn away.

John has sprawled across the chair opposite, pants and boxers shoved down to mid thigh. His cock is in his hand, already hard.

The lid of the laptop snaps shut and Rodney's on his feet and across the room in an instant. He grabs for John's hand, stilling its movement.

""Bed, now!"" Rodney demands, voice low and rough. There's no arguing with that particular tone.

Hiding a smile, John hurriedly tucks himself away and follows his lover to the door.

<lj-cut text=""Rodney/Ronon"">
<i>Rodney/Ronon</i>
Ronon appears to have sex like he eats; his mouth devours Rodney, hot and wet, and his big hands move to touch all the places that his lips don't. Sprawled across the bed on his back, Rodney can't fault his enthusiasm and arches into the determined suction as Ronon tastes each of his nipples in turn; it seems that their appetites complement one another perfectly.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""John/Ronon"">
<i>John/Ronon</i>
Ronon finds it interesting that, even though he's in a position of leadership, John Sheppard doesn't seem especially keen on giving orders. Then again, he's not terribly good at following them either, but the collar still looks just right around John's throat and when he's on his knees in front of Ronon neither of them minds too much if John is sometimes just a little disobedient.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Radek/Elizabeth"">
<i>Radek/Elizabeth</i>
Radek pauses outside the door to Dr. Weir's office, clutching the reports that he's brought for her to his chest; suddenly, he's reluctant to disturb her. He's heard the rumours that not everything about Dr. Weir's trip home went according to plan and the shadows Radek's noticed in her eyes since she returned seem to corroborate them; as he pushes his glasses back up onto the bridge of his nose, Radek feels a little guilty for the surge of hope that knowledge brings him.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""John/Rodney x2"">
<i>John/Rodney</i>
I. Rodney's never really been one for playing games in bed; truthfully, he's had a hard enough time convincing his partners that the sex is worth putting up with his more antisocial tendencies, without adding anyone's kinks to the mix. Somehow, John seems to have changed all the rules, though, and Rodney finds himself being deliberately obnoxious, until he catches that gleam in John's eyes, the one that promises it won't be long before Rodney's wrists and ankles are tied to the bed and his mouth is silenced by the hard length of John's cock.

II. When he thought that he wouldn't be coming back, it had seemed easier for John to slip away with nothing but a simple, ""So long, Rodney""; if he'd sought anything more, John's not sure he'd have been able to let go and he really hadn't wanted to second guess Rodney's reaction to the choice he'd made. It's only now that he's here and safe, and faced with the wounded look in Rodney's eyes, that John realises there was nothing easy about what he put his lover through and, as he pulls Rodney against him in a wordless apology, John wonders how long it will take him to banish that expression from Rodney's face.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Rodney/Radek"">
<i>Rodney/Radek</i>
There are moments when, despite all the stimulants they've taken, Rodney wonders how the hell they can keep going, keep on trying to find the answers that will ensure the city stays safe. When the doubts are strongest, Radek simply turns towards him and silently pulls Rodney into his arms, kissing him carefully without fanfare or fuss, and when Radek lets go, still without words, Rodney knows that they'll never let each other contemplate failure.

<lj-cut text=""ME, MYSELF AND I"">
""Rodney! Rodney!!""

McKay blinked, his train of thought completely derailed. Damn it, why did someone always have to interrupt him at a crucial moment! He opened his eyes fully, looking up to see John Sheppard bending over him. Sheppard looked distinctly pissed off.

""Hm, what is it?"" Frowning, McKay pushed himself up on his elbows, but Sheppard didn't retreat.

""Am I boring you?"" Sheppard enquired, his voice heavy with sarcasm.

Another blink and a quick look round reminded McKay, somewhat belatedly, that he and John were in his quarters, in his bed and both very much naked. All of which went a long way towards accounting for Sheppard's annoyance with his lack of focus.

""Ah..."" As snappy comebacks went it was far from his best, but McKay was still half distracted by the fact that he'd been <i>this</i> close to figuring out how to make use of the latest piece of Ancient technology that they'd discovered.

""Is that all you have to say?"" Sheppard sounded less than pleased. He sat back on his heels, still straddling McKay's thighs, and folded his arms across his bare chest.

""I'm sorry,"" McKay offered. Sheppard looked slightly mollified so he continued, ""It's just that I had a thought about that device we found..."" 

McKay let his words trail off as he noticed that Sheppard's eyes had narrowed and, yes, that was definitely a glare. Okay, so maybe now wasn't the best time to bring that up, McKay decided, but he couldn't help it if his brain was constantly working on the various problems he needed to solve.

Sheppard seemed to agree about the bad timing as he leaned forward again, jabbing McKay sharply in the ribs with a single finger. ""You know, Rodney, when I offer to give you a blow job I generally expect a little more enthusiasm. Instead, you're so self-absorbed you don't even notice!""

In an effort to regain the moral high ground, McKay shot Sheppard his best look of haughty disdain. ""Would you rather I ignored something that might possibly help to boost our power reserves? I'm sorry if your ego is put out by the fact that I was thinking about a way to ensure our survival."" He really should have let it go at that point, but McKay couldn't resist adding, ""Besides, in my case, self-absorption is completely justified. I have never discovered any other subject so worthy of my attention.""

Giving a snort of disgust, Sheppard climbed off the bed, turning his back on McKay and, coincidentally, presenting him with a very nice view as he did so. ""Jesus, Rodney, sometimes you are so far up your own ass...""

Despite the sharp words, McKay continued to enjoy the visuals as Sheppard bent over and grabbed his clothes off the floor. At least, he did until Sheppard began to pull them on, clearly intent on leaving.

""Hey, where are you going?"" McKay complained.

Already halfway to the door, Sheppard looked back for a moment. ""Well, as I'm obviously not worthy of your attention I thought I'd leave you and <i>your</i> ego to get better acquainted."" He made a brief, illustrative gesture with his right hand before continuing his journey towards the exit. ""Trust me, Rodney, it's the only way you're getting laid tonight.""

Before McKay had time to open his mouth again to protest the judgment, the door whooshed shut in Sheppard's wake. McKay flopped back against his pillow, frustrated in more ways than one. Why did Sheppard have to overreact like that? It had just been one little moment of distraction. McKay sighed. Sometimes, being a genius sucked.

Summary - There's a short list of things that are capable of rendering Rodney McKay speechless.
Author's notes - Written for the <lj user=""contrelamontre""> Toes challenge in 27 minutes. This is my first attempt at writing SGA fic.

<lj-cut text=""LIFE AND SOLE"">
John Sheppard had spent the best part of an afternoon cooped up with Rodney McKay, listening to him moan about the state of his boots. The specific complaints had been many and varied, but the bottom line was that they were, apparently, chafing his feet. McKay hadn't just mentioned this fact once during the course of the mission. Instead, he'd warmed to the topic, returning to it whenever he could.

Even now, when they were safely back on Atlantis, McKay was still complaining and Sheppard decided that the time had come for drastic action.

Jogging down the corridor, Sheppard caught up with McKay outside his quarters. ""Hey, Rodney, have you got a minute? There's something I need to talk to you about.""

McKay heaved a put upon sigh. ""Can't it wait, Major? I'm tired, hungry and my feet...""

""Ache. Yes, I know,"" Sheppard said mildly. ""I'm sorry, but it can't.""

With a sound of annoyance, McKay turned and opened the door. He stepped inside, leaving Sheppard waiting on the threshold.

""I suppose you'd better come in then,"" McKay said, his tone less than gracious.

It was invitation enough and Sheppard followed him in. As soon as the door closed behind them, he grabbed hold of McKay's arm and frogmarched him across to the bed. Sheppard pointedly ignored McKay's loud squawks of indignation as he pushed him down so that he was sitting on the edge of it. Then, Sheppard dropped to his knees in front of McKay and the protests abruptly ceased.

""Major?"" McKay sounded startled as Sheppard efficiently began to pull off the offending boots. ""Major!"" he repeated, louder, as Sheppard also disposed of his socks.

When Sheppard drew both of McKay's feet into his lap and began to massage them, there was nothing but a series of deep, relieved groans. The sounds were accompanied by the contented wriggling of Rodney's slightly sweaty toes.

Grinning, Sheppard let his fingers continue to work their magic. Clearly he hadn't lost his touch. Mentally, he added foot massages to the short list of things that were capable of rendering Rodney McKay speechless. On a whim, Sheppard decided to try out another option. Cupping his hand around the heel of McKay's right foot, he carefully lifted it. Then he bent his head and sucked the big toe into his mouth.

Sheppard felt the sudden tension in McKay before the blessed silence was broken.

""Major!!""

Sheppard ignored the startled outburst.

""John!"" McKay said more insistently. ""Stop it, that's just disgus-""

The word ended abruptly in a sharp intake of breath as Sheppard began to bob his head over McKay's foot. He curled his tongue around McKay's toes, fellating them in earnest.

The moment of speechlessness didn't last.

""Oh my..."" McKay gasped weakly.

Sheppard reached up with his free hand, squeezing McKay's hard cock through his pants. All the while, his mouth kept up its steady rhythm, slowly sucking McKay's genius brain out through his toes.

""God!"" McKay shouted finally, before collapsing backwards onto the bed in a quivering heap.

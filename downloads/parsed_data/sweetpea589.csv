"event","Wow. I almost forgot I had an account on this thing. It of course has been a while since I have even looked at this but it still is a way for me to vent and drop all the thoughts that seem to cluter my head. A theraputic method if you may. I am in the emphasis of Psychology. 
Where to start or not to start. Today is a Friday. It was the say of our Induction. I was inducted last year but this year I was an officer. That means for the last year I have been putting together events and other such things as a high officer to national honor society called Psi Chi. It has taken a bit of my life away but all in a good way. This event today was a big deal. I had to make all the center pieces, and buy all the food. Ya that took alot out of my account about $300. But what can I do I have the Costco card.... Anyways it took a lot out of me. I had helped plan this for weeks and it all came together today. So I am happy that it is all over now and I don't really have to do anything else but help get the new officers situated. Still I wish Chris was there. He didn't come to the induction I was inducted at and he did'nt  come to this one were I had to give a little speech and represent my position. My mother did end up coming so did my brother and little sister Alexis. I was super busy but super happy that they came as well. Afterwards we all went to Chili's for some much needed alcoholic treatment and celebration. Dr. Moss and her Husband even came. I was happy to talk with them. But that is all said and done. I must get to my other demands now. Such as my 20 page paper and other major tests. 
Although right now I am in a bit of a pickle. Why do they even call it that. Its a bit odd. But Chris is getting Ryan into the new GTA game. That means my spending time with him tonight is sitting around watching GTA for a 3rd time. Not really what I was hoping for. I don't find as much excitment in the game as he does. For some obvious reasons. I want to drink my wine and chill with him. I wasn't in the mood to socialize tonight. I already had my fill of that. But we got in an arguement over how diffcult I was beinf over this. Hell I could be a lot worse. I mean Tiffany would not deal with this the way I did. She went to bed. I am staying up. But for what to sit and pretend I am super interested in the game I have seen 3 times over. I can only take some much before I'd rather just be cuddled next to my boy- just me and him- watching a movie or hell even fucking. Oh well we must go through these spells every so often right. I really need this sesmester to be over. I need a full day off from everthing. I need sun and sleep and booze oh yea and some money again. What can I do but not try to go insane in the mean time......"

"event","It almost seems that every title should be ""It's been awhile"". I always seem to pick this back up after a long pause. Thus each title seems to drive toward such thoughts. So then whats new- whats my current life attending to? Well most of the same old of course. I still work- yep still manager status. I really love so many of the people I work with- Lauren, Stephanie, Nick, Krista etc. I love to hang out with them outside of work, have a few big beers. Thats all normal.
I am out of school for the summer. Decide to continue making my life easy with time for myself. I still seemed to be doing work for school though. I joined two clubs for Psychology and now this year I am going to be an officer. I was elected to Psi Chi secretary- the national honor society, and PSO treasurer- the school pscyhology club. I also have been accepted to the International Honor Society- Golden Key. This summer I have already meet with my clubs and have plans for more meetings this summer. The stress of that is pilling up. But its all for good.
Lets see what else. I'm having fun being 21. Don't got out to bars too often but enjoy the power. I personally, like what this journal isn't personal enough, like to drink a beer or champagne at home with Chris or my Dad. Just a nice relaxer. On the topic of Chris. Chris the Boy Toy. Hmm yes... well it has been now about 8 months. I remember trying to describe him to my friend and wondering what direction I was going. Hoping not to let my hope fall and leaving a mist of wonder instead. Well we are good- what do I mean we are great right now! I see him almost everyday. I don't even see my own- newly designed room that often- I sleep at his house almost every night. I don't even think my bed is broken into yet! Though it is a very nice bed for naps- the very few I get. I do have my little bag at his place- toothbrush and facewash. I helped redecorate his bathroom- bought towels and such. We go for groceries and supplies quite often. Just yesterday I got keys to his house. It seems I've turned out to be the cook. Not a good thing. I can't cook much at all :( oh well we will deal with our mac n chesse then. I like him and this summer looks to be even better for us. 
Man on Man that's right summer is pretty much here! Ah I love the sun. I wanna surf so bad- but I gotta get it worked out. The right weather, day, time, people, energy, board etc. I really hope to get going soon. I need the work out. I'm feeling so sluggish. I plan on working out alot this summer. Maybe I can go for a run tomorrow. After I get off work. Oh or Bowflex. Or maybe the bike. I hate running when other people are out. It's a unwanted pressure. I'm not a good enough running for pressure. I wish my neighborhood was a nice place to run at. Like a park like area. 
Guess that day June 24th? One year since my room burned. Wow things have taken an interesting turn since then. But I am thankful for everything so much more now- where I am now- my life- all of it. I couldnt ask for more
-My health, my family, my lover, my friends, my job, my education, my tranquility, my spark of life and energy. I Love it all, even with the bumps I run into."

"event","Ya thats right its a night snack of cookie dough-   I can't help it! It's just so good.
Today was okay. Got up a bit early but to late to take a morning shower. Got to school early and sat in my car while everything was getting really warm with the morning sun. Walked to my first class to daze through it. We were out early due to a speaker presentation at UH. Tuesday, Chuck, and I then continued to the dome for lunch- a club sandwich, sun chips and water. Relaxing in the warm breaze outside in the shaded table area- it was perfect. We then attended the lecture from the possible new cognitive psych teacher- who I must say looks like a nerdy Justin Timberlake. I then departed to my car to scurry home. I then finally persuaded my father to go to the beach with me so I would not be alone surfing (he would watch from the beach). There were no waves and it was a bit crowded. I then decided to lay out and get some sun while he read on the wall. We did witness Seaworld save a stranded seal. Then my dad  went and picked up my brother. Once they got back there was actually some okay waves. We paddled out and it was Great! I caught several good waves- hehe fun since I thought it might be hard to get it again after not doing it for months. I got this one wave so well- I made the drop and just glided down and at an angel, like I was good or something. It was perfect! It was such a thrill. A good start. I caught several other waves but found that myself in front of the wave to many times- going to fast. We went in after a bit, showered up. I ran off to Karen's 21st birthday dinner. Got a call from Steven randomly. It was quite nice. We might meet up for lunch or something tomorrow. Now I am back home from the fun filled day off.
The only dispointing part may have been that I tried to get several people to go out with me to the beach. Tuesday and Chuck, Lauren, and Chris- But nope. No one was willing. Tuesday and Chuck were going to go t La Jolla, Lauren work, Chris had no swim trunks down here. Very disappoiting- It seemed like Chris didnt care to much to go anyways. I kinda miss him right now. I need the space once in a while so I'm not so needed or dependent but I miss that constant. Oh wells
I'm off to study or sleep- which ever..."

"event","I just do not know. I'm in one of those moods right now. Just a mood. Not where I want to be but waiting for something. Don't know what. 
Well then thus is life.
Of life I am happy. 
School is going decent. I am not getting to far behind yet. But then again I havn't really gotten to far. 
Work is going as normal. Money for later.
Saturday I might be going up to SC to Chris's parents house. Stay the night. Then head out for 6Flags. Early, Early in the morning Sunday. It should give us plenty of time for taking the rides for several spins before its time to retire. I will also get a chance to meet up with his friends again. Small steps. I can't ask for to much, he needs easing. I feel like a animal traniner trying to coax an animal to the comfort of others.
I don't think I give him enough credit. I should be better about it all. But then again he has lost alot of points. I do treat him very well. 
My computer is working out great for me. I love it to be straight- well as straight as I can be with loving a machine. The calendar keeps me so together- Everything is just so polished together. I've noticed it has really helped with my schooling, even if its for the smallest reason.
Love my dad. He becomes such a chatterbox when 1- he drinks 2- gets back from a trip 3- or when in a talkative mood. Crazy dad.
Feel bad about my mother. I'm realizing that I see alot less of her. I also slowly notice how things are still tough for her and that makes me sad to know she is hurt. I wish that something almost magical would happen to solve all her problems. I just know that there are to many things that can't be fixed and that things are never to good. If she continues to mask it, if she continues to hide it all, if I continue to shove it to the back of my mind... it won't get better... It won't go away. 
Next.
I need my man."

"event","Yesterday was a short day. I opened the store after a long Saturday night. Got off early at 3pm. Went home. Helped my dad finally setup the internet. Thus meaning that I can do alot of work now here at the house again without having to run to other sources to work with it.  A little step was also made. My father, brother, Chris and I watched ""24"". I actually got everyone together. It was a small but a step. 
Now today I had the day off. So after driving back home from Chris's place this morning I had to run over to help out my brother buy his Guitar. After this silly errand, I went back home to start stripping and sanding my desk. I need to get this done before school starts so that I can actually have a desk and workplace to handle all of my work.  It took almost all day to do this. It started to get late and very very cold so we stopped. With saw dust all over. It was interesting but my desk looks very clean right now and I am starting to feel more perpared for school.  
I got my dream computer finally. I'm so happy-its so pretty. Its the black Macbook. Oh its so nice!
Its got so many features that I love and more. It came with a free printer/scanner/copier. I can only hope that all this will make this next semester alot easier."

"event","<p>For starters I didn't do so bad on that one Physio test- actually got an A on it- surprising considering one I knew I got wrong for sure I got a 9/10. Silly- Silly teachers.<br />Then being 21 is nice and all but I am to mature for the normal crazy first year celebration. Why is it I feel a variety of ages from 15-29. All depending on the mood and the setting- not to mention who I am with.&nbsp;<br />Halloween was fun- Danielle and I had a mellowed night. I say I had more fun hanging out with her while getting ready as compared to actually going out. I just miss some of my friends so much when I don't see them as much as I use to in HS. They say that is life- people move on anf grow. I always feel I can never keep in touch with most of my friends and I hope it does not occur to some of my dear friends I enjoy to know now.&nbsp;<br />School continues<br />Work continues<br />My room is coming back together after this whole Fire thing and all. I think I am going furniture shopping on thursday after I pamper myself and get my nails done. A girl needs a nice massage once and a while. It's one of the most relaxing things I can do other then sleep. Ah how good sleep really is.&nbsp;<br />For a bit of time I had a rental bed- yes they rent bed- frankly they rent anything one can find in your house. Point being I slept on this one until I went out and bought a REALLY nice bed to myself. Then the span of about one weekend I had 2 queen sized beds in my room. It was really fun. I got to roll out of bed in the morning to just another soft bed. The only bad part was the ceiling fan that stopped me from doing leaps from one to the other.&nbsp; As my dad remarked though- "" its like a whore house in here, two queen sized beds for what reason"" What a Whore!<br />So once I get my head board, my dresser, my new bookcase I will just need- a TV, DVD player, a surfboard, bedding, rugs, and tons and tons of clothes and shoes. Oh Ya! You know it. SHOPPING SPREE. What else is a girl to do when she has been given a $10,000 check to spend on buying all new stuff.... hehe its just so exciting. I love it! The only thing that is holding me back right now is the fact that the bank has not gotten me my card yet- so it's been all in cash. Not very much fun. Soon enough though I will be charging it like crazy.&nbsp;<br />Well I better get off this computer. Someone I know is playing his video game and has been hooked on it for the last hour. Maybe I can distract him long enough to get him to stop. It's to much fun being a girl- with power that she knows how to use. </p>"

"event","<p>Damn it. I hate this feeling so much. It's the feeling of being a faliure. I seem to be in this rut. I can't get out. I study hard for this test I had this morning. Almost hit a car while running late to get to the class. Once in class all was well until it got to the questions I did not study for. I thought I had covered all of them, but it looked like I had missed one quiz and all the information that was in it I did not study. If it makes sense I had to work one day and skip class, when I skipped that class I missed getting one of my quizes back. Well when I studied for my test I studied all my past quizing and blanked out on the last one that I had taken. When the test came with the same questions that were on the quiz I didnt get back, I could not remember them anymore. Funny thing is I knew all the answer One week ago. But as of this morning I forgot all of it. Damn it!!<br />I feel like shit now. I have to go to my stats class. Another class I had missed the other day. So that puts me behind in that class as well. I really don't like this feeling.&nbsp;<br />I don't want to be doing this right now- School- I know its just a phase but I don't want to work, I don't want to do school- Fuck I need a Fucking vacation- I never get a fucking vaction. Never- Instead my work has me use my vacation hours now when I don't a chance to get away. Just stuck where I have always been... stuck like glue...<br />Im not the one to tell you what you want me to.</p>"

Wait 3 hours for the tow truck to charge you $50 and take it to a tire company to charge you $108 for a new tire. 
I was not in any mood or condition from that point to make my photo shoot in Plam Springs at 2pm. Later after sleeping for several hours and driving back from my moms, I hit another car. Nothing major just screw dents. Nothing compared to the large dent on my trunk from the Lexis that hit me two weeks ago. Which I cant seem to get a hold of anyone for. 
OTher then all that I am tired.
Tomorrow is 91X's X-fest with Dano's good friend Eddie. SHould be fun.

Well That was last Thursday... and It didnt get posted.
Today is Wednesday of the following week.
I currently have re-touchd up hair-Darker each time I go...
I have newly painted nails- black tips- even more dark 
Nothing to do on my night off from work. It seems to happen that way.
Damn why cant the sun be out at night so I can go chill at the beach...
Kind of odd request but oh well.

On a side note--- I'm over Canada...
Producers are kinder
Drama may occur...
Hell I like to get in trouble once in a while.
It keeps things interesting. ::Mauh hhahah::"

Well Not only does it have great breakfast bagels it has great drinks and get this wireless internet for free! Ah I love that the most that means that I am going to be here a lot more now.<br />Today seems also be the day for a strike. It looks like a a couple shops are closed like Rubio's and such. Well that make it a bit interesting<br />Yesterday was an amazing day for me. Other then being super busy it was great. I got up early. Snoozed in for a bit. Then I called my girly Megan. We were suppose to go to a photoshoot. She had to see if she could get the car from her mom, so I waited for her to confirm that she could go. In the mean time I got my shower and my breakfast bagel. Took a little nap and then off we went to the mansion which was past Merrieta. Got there signed in and got dressed and bam went to work. A couple photographers at a time different locations... ah it was great. The mansion was the house of a member of the group ""The Cars"". There was a guitar shaped pool, a great veiw and canyon. The weather was perfect. It was a great ego boost. I loved. But I had to jet out early so I got $40 for my drive and I would get money from the photgraphers and cards later since i had to leave. My friend Megan would grab it for me later. Overall I had so much fun. I can't wait to do more. For my first time it wasnt bad at all. <br />Welp I wish I was in La. But people are busy. I guess...<br />I have the day off and I gotta see what I want to do with it. In the mean time I must take a warm shower and wake up some more. <br />Oh ya this weekend was great on top of the photo shoot I saw my girly Danielle!! And Megan! Double Woot! We went to the spa and chilled in it after we jumped the fence. Ha we found a bunch of rose petals all around the spa... Wonder what happend...hmmm... Shifty eyes..<br />Then went and watch a movie with everyone. It was relaxing. It was just the mellow night I needed. ah... I love vacation like days...<br /></font></strong>"

The crowd at the show really sucked though. Since it was an all ages show it was populated by 13yr olds. It was retarded not even a cute guy in site. Just lurkers who needed to wash their hair. Then some 15 yr old TRIED to hit on me. I dont understand where he thought it was okay with me for him to put his hands on my hips. But I sure didnt give that clue out. I hate bubble invaders when there is plenty of room for space.&nbsp;
Then I was in Pb this morning. Its always so relaxing. I went and saw Nick. I like hanging out with him. I feel comfortable. I take my time. I go to my bagel shop and get some food and take my merry time back up to V-town. I listen to good music and take in the smooth sky.... Ahhh sigh...

I need to run more. I jumped rope yesterday, I ran the night before that. Tonight I really cant because I should be studying and working on french work. But of course last minute even with all of the week off from that class. This is always how it is though. I should know myself by now."

"event","This is really stupid. I've got to say that itunes is gay. I just loaded it so I could DL music the legal way on my new compy and they dont like canadians it looks like. Okay so the guy Gray told me that he sang a song on this one album which I grabed before off a ""illegal"" system. So when I tried to get the album off Itunes it didnt like that I was American and the album is canadian and wont let me download it. How gay is that. I love the Cd and want to have it but cant!!! Soo check them out and tell me what you <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/neverendingwhitelights"">think...</a><br />So of course the reason for why I would be trying to burn music is to avoid my studying. I have a test tomorrow that I am not looking forward to. Once that is over then work and the other part of the test comes on thursday. So its not over yet. I dont know what to really expect but hell what can I do. I should be studying is that I should be doing. But nah....<br />I was in this one class room working on some work for the test and only a few students were in there. No class. So after being there over an over I guess a class was going to start. But I didnt notice, no one stated that class would be starting. So when the teacher handed me a worksheet I tried so hard not to laugh. She didnt know I wasnt in here class. And she started to lecture. Well I had to finish my work and then I left half way through her lecture. Oh well, it was a relaxed class anyways. No one cared. HAHA<br />I have unitl April 7th. That is now the set date. I have some time to prepare and create of finish whatever I wish with who ever I want. Then everything is going to stop. I just hope everything goes well. Cross my fingers.&nbsp;<br />So much going on...<br />I have meetings,<br />research fair,<br />NAMI walk,<br />A visitor,<br />Orals,<br />tests,<br />my mom is moving, and so much more of course.&nbsp;<br />"

"event","<p><font size=""2"">I have had a okay day... then a terrible day.... then a great day all before noon. I feel on the verge of crying over the situation I have be drawn upon.<br /><br />It started when I first stepped into class, my friend Lauren asks "" Did you finish your Proposal paper?"" "" Nope havnt started it"" was my response.... BAM!!!&nbsp;<br />It was due today. Yep that's right I miss read the due dates and thought it was due on Thursday. I had planned out today, my day off, to compelte the whole thing considering my busy weekend with a French test on monday... Yes that one that I had failed.&nbsp;<br />So of course this 30 second dicussion left me FUCked... It was due in 10mins and I hadnt even started. I decided to face the fact. I wasnt going to run out of class because he still wasnt in class yet. I had no emergency to excuse&nbsp;a late assignment. He only accepts it if there is&nbsp; a written statement with an emergency on it. I had no reason other then my honest mistake. I would receive no credit and would have to ace everything from now on to even get an A-. I was about to cry. I work so hard and one small mistake on misreading has knocked me so hard.&nbsp;<br />I then decided I would still compelte it today after class. I would still out my whole effort into. I would then confront him tomorrow during his office hours. I would explian to him my mistake, and my honest concern. I would not lie, I would not excuse myself, I would straight forward admit my flaut. See if he would still read it for any feed back, if he gave me ANY credit which I doubt, I would cry. I dont know what else I could do. But lay it out as it was no squirming.&nbsp;<br />So after facing the fact that I was fucked, I faced the lession and took my notes. I tried not to show my disappointment in myself on my face. But the feelings were so strong, that I try so hard, put myself forward in an honest way, and fall short because of a misunderstanding of my days. I was so depressed.... Still am....<br />At the end of class he explained that he would be giving back the test that we took last week or so. He would not go over it considering one person had yet to take it. He started to pass them out. He first explained the results on the test. A mean score of 70. A deviation of 5. a max of 78. With the test out of 80. 14 A's, 11 B's 4 C's and no D's or F's. Well at least I got some points on the test and didnt fail it. He was across the room when he called out my name for the test. As he walked over he had a smile/ grin somewhat on his face. Lauren pointed this out. I got my test and kinda flipped through it. I looked at the final grade and BAM!!!&nbsp; My score was 78points. That means I was the highest in the class. That I had beat out everyone else. That I had aced my test. Sigh. I was at that moment feeling the sensation that my eyes were watering. I was sooo wanting to cry. A roller coaster of emotions today.&nbsp;<br />I guess I still have a chance at getting a A- in the class. </font></p>"

"event","<p><em>Well Bonjour! Ah yes it is another day. And I have plenty to do. Mais with that fact plenty was done as well. How about this weekend . Ya I'd say that was fun. I went to a party in Mira Mesa. It was very entertaining. It was a langerie party. I went home after work and then struggled to figure out what was it was that I would wear. I mean I didnt have anything perfect in mind. I was going to have to throw something together to make it work. Well Yep I got that done. I ended up deciding on layering and to work with black, always a complementing color for blondes. Ran down to Mira Mesa with a bit of sprinkles and bad windsheild wipers. Figured out that Roger would be there and felt alot better. It was cold outside so I came in dressed in my comfy pjs, I mean it was a pj party as well. But when I found people I knew and felt better about wearing my outfit, I changed in the bathroom.&nbsp;Good idea. I was surprised at the turn out. I suspected that the girls there would be very negative toward me, because one I didnt know any of them I only knew the guys at the party and two because of the nature of the party. I was thrown for a loop very fast when I got a complement from a girl "" Your a nice peice of Ass"" Oh my I was shocked and blushing. She wanted me to know that I had a nice ass. HA imagine that. Then further down the night another girl there said that "" You are the prettiest girl here""&nbsp; Oh my! Golly gee. For the rest of the night I was complemented on my outfit, how smart it was to throw a belt on it, how my freckles were cute, etc. I was feeling very sesure in a somewhat revealing outfit. Not to mention the guys. All of the guys must be mentioned. Well Roger was there and he is always so kind to me. He definitly liked the outfit was well. Tyler and Eric both gave me plenty of attention, calling my name, trying to get me to talk with them in a room alone, Troy was very kind as well. Brad is just funny, others made comments, looks, and complaments as well. I had a fun night playing with them all. What else am I to do. I went to a party where all of these guys are cute and giving me attention that I just suck up, but its all for no purpose. I have my thoughts and feelings on my canadian who said would be my slave once he come out here. So it's all just fun and mind games.&nbsp;<br />As for now of course I need to be working on my homework. I have a test on friday with three papers due, a french test on monday with a whole workbook due, research proposals and data to be collected, thats not to mention going to work for most of the week. I am fully swamped but I am just going to have to bite my lip and go on. No stopping now. Its only the beginning of it all.&nbsp;<br />Who do you know me as.... Christina or Evey? One person two names, variations with both.&nbsp;<br /><img alt=""Time for Some Fun."" src=""http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a247/Evey85/a.jpg"" /></em></p>"

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"" align=""center"">I have figured out some great news. It could have been better but I am pleased still with the outcome.&nbsp;<br />My spring break for this semester is split between the two schools. Which means that I will still be in school for the whole time. I start off with Palomar followed by CSUSM. The good news would be that the day they overlap is the day that is expected for Gray's arrival. That further concludes that I will then have one week prior to prepare and prep. And then one week of good time first his first days stay. I&nbsp; will still have class and work but this gives me more room to arrange proper timing for all three. A little bit of a relief. I know that I will&nbsp; be hating the ride up and down. But I wont be able to stop smiling while im doing it. Just thinking about it now has got me warm.&nbsp;<br />Once again Happy St. Valentine's Day to all my beloved friends!!!<br /><br /><br />P.S. slightly nervous, I have my first Midterm at CSUSM today.&nbsp; Though it wont be the hardest one, a test on MS Word, I still dont know what to expect. That is what scares me the most. The unexpected curve ball that I was not prepared for that seems to jump out of new experiences.</p>"

<P><EM>On a more personal- nonSchool related term- Im still really stoked about my surf board. I want to go and use it now, with my thin little bathing suit in the cold cold water just to get a feel for it. But I know Ill be way to cold for me to realistically do that. I must wait for&nbsp;a suit. Bum!!! M.C.D all the way!</EM></P>
<P><EM>One other note- I can't wait now for Thursday. Im soooo going to the taste of chaos tour. Yep Yep- that means Thrice, Story of the Year, The deftones, Atreyu, and so much more! Ah and I didnt even have to buy the ticket. Roger bought it for me, so I owe him a huge favor. It's going to be good and I hope that alot of my friends end up going. I know Roger and his friend, but maybe Gus, Scott, Megan, or some other people. I am also waiting to see if I can get any speacil clearance on the concert but that is all hush hush.... so I didnt tell you... on the DL you know. Either way it's going to be a sick as concert and I can't wait.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Oh tomorrow is V-day. After reading the Vagina Monologue I know that many places will be celebrating the day. I wish I could go see a preformance. But still I know the thought and effort toward the cause is going down this important day. GO Women!!! Yes it can also be a day for lovers or S.A.D singles awareness day.

<P><FONT size=2>What am I doing: Using the computer to do homework</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>What time is it: 8:26pm</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Why : Because of the lack of a good quality computer at home that lacks interuptions and distractions- which would include smoke, alexis, and anything else not of my interest</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I went on this date, makeup up dinner thing that he owed me today. It wasn't terrible. Got some food, had fun. It was an overall busy day today. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>- woke up, class, quiz, lab, meet Kuntal, went home and grabbed stuff, went to AAA the DMV, then to the mall, shopped, returned a skirt, ran to the food store, made lunch and cookies, ran to my mothers, ran to my dads, ran to San Marcos Blvd for dinner, came here, finish the cog lab and now have just printed up the lecture notes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The library closes in about 25mins. I really dont want to leave just yet. I was think though that I would go to Starbucks and study there. Its always a nice hub to go to. Other then that I may run home and grab some of those walnut cookies I made... yummy. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Got a text message today. Saying he was thinking of me. Always a nice perk to the day. He keeps my mind busy on him and away from others. This helps to lessen distraction. I'm at the point now were I'm not as happy as I use to be about him coming. I actually would prefer another few months. I dont feel ready, if that makes sense. I also dont want this feeling and excitment to die. Its so mysterious considering our first meeting. I have so much to look forward to that its almost like Christmas. The present you know youll get to unwrap but you know that after that morning has come and passed that same excitment wont come until another new Christmas arrives. Or another boy in my case. If I can just hold on to what I have now that would be great. I can picture time from now. And one thought that keeps me smiling. The fact that once he comes, once we meet again, a trist, I will have at least one picture of me and him. I dont care how good, I dont care what we are doing, I just care that it is me and him. A picture to last of a connection we have. Evidence to mark my life. The simiplist and pleasent thing I want. Okay i lied maybe a picture more then something you seen of him with his fans. The stupid snap shoots, No I want a little more, more intamate, playful, him and me. Something not anyone can get but me.</FONT></P>"

fact that I just dont care to stress at this moment in time. I always
felt so rushed last semester on always having something to do. Right
now with it being so early in the semester I dont have much on my mind
to worry. <br>
I saw Underworld the second one. Not bad. Blood of course.&nbsp; Lots
of it. Oh yes and one very hot sex scene. Short but still skin was
shown.... of course my mind floats off with this image. To images I
make in my own mind. Yum....<br>
Anyways. Allfie is in my Cogn. Psych class on fridays. That makes me
very happy to know that I have a buddy that I know outside of school in
my class. Party time!!<br>
I really love the color black. Its such a flattering color. I love it.
It works so well with everything. I love the feeling I have when I wear
it. Like I can be who I want to be with this color. What can you judge
me with, Nothing. I am what I am. <br>
I was pondering this the other day. What are my goals now. What do I
want. I of course want alot. But what can I strive for. I see myself
getting my BS in Psych. I see myself&nbsp; traveling. I want to
continue my studying of Psych. Sooo... How about I study abroad in
Canada. Get away. Try out my French.&nbsp; Visit a rocker. Study in a
new area with new thoughts. It seems like it catches all the needs I
want to fill in almost one shot. Well hell It just poped in my head
today I'm sure I gotta look more into it. But just a thought. Hmm any
good gradute schools there???<br>
I think I will make some nice breakfast tomorrow. Oh and some coffee.
Maybe its time to curl up in my bed. In my blankets. With my curls in
my hair. ""Goldy Locks""<br>

The text messages are good but always so short. Not the same as our hour long dicussions. OOh. So wait. Oh yes this is suppose to make up for the last entry that I was writing. That one was going so well. It was very disappionting when it was gone and I had put so much work into it. At least it wasnt a paper for school.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>So hmm I dont even remember what was on it. I think I was refering to my break and school coming. A recap on the vacation or something.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Well Ya vacation is over. Ugh It wasnt much of a vacation. I worked most of it. Ya that was what was meant by the 51 hours title last time. I had worked 51 hours in that last week. One of those days was an open to close day. Which brings in over time money that I have still yet to see. The money from the overtime that I pulled last paycheck went to cover my education. WOot! Yep I am now currently a offical California State University San Marcos Student. YA! I complelted one goal. To get there. But the down fall is the money. Once again I'm paying for it all. That means the books, parking, and tuition. While I still go to Palomar as well. Costing me more money. Oh my. All money earned and saved has been sucked dry. OuCh! But ya know what I did get an Id card. teehehe. The picture isnt bad either. Oh and with thanks to Misha- I have a Facebook account. I totally spaced out and forgot that I could get one now that I am a student. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Hmm what else. I look forward to March, keeps getting pushed back. Can't blame him. I kinda want the time. I like time to myself. Time to think. Maybe to over analysis but time is a virtue. ""not overally inspired.""Pish!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I have the day off today. I went to French class. Half of my old class was there. Just a great group of people you could say. Then after that I walked down to the cashiers office with Matt to get our parking passes. On the way I saw Jim- Alfie's and Gus's boss. Dylan was also there. So I said Hi to Dylan and then Jim had to poke over and say hi. haha if he even recalls who I am, nor do I care what he thinks. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>After that I called work, alfie, and kuntal. All eh calls. Drove over to get some food which I ate at my dads cold house. Then over to my mothers to check on what books I needed to buy over at Cal State. Then dropped off the movie I rented. Ran over to Cal State and bought my books. I was kinda of happy 1. I didnt need a new book for french. 2. For Cal State I have one of the books I needed again. One was optional and the rest just came to 200. I was pleased at the sucess on that one.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&lt; Song noted so I won't forget&gt;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Now I am talking somewhat to my canadian. And getting kicked off by my little brother. So I must finish up and again another time. So for now Au revoir.</FONT></P>"

was a kid. Things are quite different now. Year have unfolded my life
story. That only I know completly. <br>
Good Old Apple Sauce. <br>
I did quite of bit of work today. It felt good to get things cleared
and cleaned at work. Which reminds me that I need to REALLY clean my
room. Its starting to get hard to step around in. That also reminds me
of all the new clothes I want. Ooh and new shoes. Hmm What a girly
impluse. Gotta love it.<br>
I have school orientation tomorrow. Im kind of excited to go and figure
out the last bit of information to start the semester but avoiding
actually starting and paying. Damn money problems. I bet this whole new
pay check with its over time is going to be gone in one blow from
school charges. I dont even want to imagine it anymore. <br>
Its only 9 pm oh my. So early yet it feels so late. Poor little eyes.<br>
So in the past week I have seriously been inches from being in major
accidents both not my fluat. The first I was driving down Lake going
45mph in&nbsp; the 35mph zone. Around 2:30pm, Just back from the pool
on a Hot Winter day. haha Suckers!! Sorry and then this stupid lady
almost pulls out and almost hits me because she was looking right and
started to pull out to make a left turn across onto lake. I had to
swerve. But I was okay. Got to Costco bought 3 large pizza's and headed
to work. It was Inventory that day. I was scheduled at 4pm till
whenever it ended. But got there early to get the pizza there. Eat and
then clocked in at 3:45pm. Started to prep some more for the Inventory
service to come in. Then it all started. Didnt really get out till
5:30am. Home at 6 am. It was a long night/morning. Then went back to
work at 2pm that day. Well its overtime.<br>
Now the other accident almost happened tonight on my way to get gas for
my car. I was stopped on the off ramp from the 5. And it turned green.
I went across the intersections and the guy who speed through and ran
the red light way after almost hit me and then drove across all the
lanes to make a right turn. Anyways he was an idoit. Grr. I am just
lucky I havnt gotten hit yet. I really dont need that to weigh down on
my mind. <br>
I really need someone to rub my shoulders right now. They are so sore. ""Personal Service Person come rub my back it hurts""<br>
This week also looks pretty hecktick. I have orientation for school
from 8 am to noon. Work at 1pm to 9pm. Then I work the rest of the
week, were on thursday I will work a 9:30am to 8:30pm shift. And
complete that week on saturday. Then start the new week and the new
school semster. The loop goes round. I think this gives me the right
for a vacation or two. Hmm Canada seems nice. Doesnt it. <br>

As of today I am and still doing nothing. Nothing at all. Okay maybe I
lied a bit. I did sleep in and make French Toast for my Dad and
Brother. It was quite good. I made it in my Aero Pj's and with a cup of
coffee in my hand. I just took me time. Then we watched Ocean's11.
Where then I continued my day and went for a tan. I got home to clean
off in a oh so warm shower. I got to use my new conditioner, new razors
and new tooth brush I just bought yesterday. Its nice to feel pampered
by my own doing. I then continued to listen to some music and primp
myself slowly. Made some easy make from the large box full my father
bought me. Finished watching the end of Ocean's 12 with my brother and
mon pere. Decided to procrastinate on going to CSUSM for another day. I
need to figure out how I am going to pay for this all. I dont have the
money to pay for it all. And havnt really started looking into it. I
feel really bad but I dont like thinking about it. <br>
-Side note I hate this with a passion. Paul is on the phone and I cant
stand hearing him. I cant stand much of him at all. Why? ugh... He's so
god damn annoying. I think once I finally get my computer I wont have
to come over here to see him ever. If I want to. Its just so stupid
coming over here and getting so frustrated at this household. I hate
it. I cant stand it. I cant stand him. GO away!!! FUck!!! Grr and I
found out that my Canadian is Older then Paul. Great! I now see how
mature I am and how silly my mother is. Ah I hope they never talk to
each other Ever! I dont want to associate them together at all. <br>
Ah golly gee Im so wrapped up about this guy in Canada. Its silly. He's
just so cute. I am fascinated by him in a good way. I just dont know
what it all means. At the moment I will take it as it comes. The joy,
the giggles I get from hearing from him, from thinking of him, from
having something remind me of him. Sigh... Silly little girl....<br>
I went to the movies last night. It was nice. I saw Pride and Prejudice
at 10:45pm. Haha funny thing is is that no one was there. So I had the
whole movie to myself. It was soooo nice. Kind of lonly but very
spacious. I was very warm and sprawled out. <br>
For the rest of the day I dont know what I am going to do but not in the mood to care.<br>"

I rode a little motor cycle too. It was fast. Alfie drove me around the

Gas filled.<br>
Phone Charged.<br>
Head slighlty pounding.<br>
Stomach slightly hungry.<br>
Though it is winter my checks are flushed and warm.<br>
All is dark and many sleeping.<br>
Im at my moms apartment typing loudly because there is not way to type softly.<br>
My thoughts never cease. <br>
The desire never gone.<br>
The look reads late. <br>
Im stuck.<br>
No where to go, no where to get out, lost in my thoughts of hope.<br>
What am I thinking? Why do this? Why bother?<br>
I want to take a vacation, to Canada. But can't. I dont have the time,
I have the money but not worth it for that short of a time. I have the
money now but I'm not sure if it will last. I have no clue how I'm
going to go to cal state or afford it. I havent motivated myself to get
all that I need done. I just want to get lost in my blakets, my
thoughts, lose track of time and do nothing. I want to stop and just do
nothing. I want to get lost. Get away from it all. But I know that it
cant happen like that, time continues no matter how much I want it to
stop or to go faster. <br>
Why? Is it worth something? What does it all mean? I try and keep my
mind my strength my good judgement. I'm a smart girl. That what makes
my life seems so tied down. So much responsibilty. With so much more
that I want. I Would torture myself to have a glimpse of pleasure. I
push myself harder then I should. What Am I? Am I something to him?
Does it matter? He called me yesterday. I had just sent him a text to
say happy holidays. He called me. I missed it. He left a message. I
called back. I left a message. He called back. &lt; Phone Tag&gt; I
answered. We talked. The phone cut out after my money had ran out. 1am
his time- 10pm mine. Why? So far away. So distant. In so many ways. Is
it silly to think of him being close to me. He'll be in LA in a few
months to record his entire album. Time that I can come to see him. I
hope, thats all that can be done. <br>
School starts soon. Work continues. Friends are always there. And Boys will always come...<br>

Should I list through them or dot on a few... so many choices to life...<br>
First off my current position: Slightly hungry concluding from the
point that the last thing I ate was a Peanut butter cup this
morning/afternoon.<br>
My eyes are slightly red from crying. And my nose is congested from being sick. <br>
I'm pretty much done with my shopping or Im just gotten to the point where I just dont care. <br>
School is over and I still have work. Not to bad, but not complelty free.<br>
My family pisses me off to no extent.<br>
I did pass my classes this last semester. I got 3 A's and 1 B. I can
accept it. I would have prefered all A's but you cant have it all when
you slacked off like I did.<br>
I love my girls. Thanks once again for all the gifts they were extra nice. <br>
Last night was a blast. Watching all the chick flicks we could. And
they were all good... gotta love naked ass shots. Anyways. It was a
nice relaxed time with my girls. The night before was a Christmas party
at Will's, that was fun.<br>
I need to stop being lazy and just do things. I could be doing so much
but I really dont want to anymore. I just wish that I was in Canada
right now. Snuggled up warm with someone. I cant help but think of him
so much. I only hope he does the same. Now that he is back home.<br>
When and where can I get away. This is not my ideal situation. What can
I do? Deal with what I have and smirk. Hope for a moment that is better
then the rest. To escape to thought that I want to be true. To pretend
that Im not where I am. To dream.<br>

tired of all the work. I'm beat. Another long day at the Leather store.
Another day that included corporate stopping in to see how everything
was going on the busy ""black friday"" weekend. It just so exhuasting. I
guess thats how things are going to be. I think its just because of the
time change at work. We were open till 10 tonight and I didnt get out
till 10:45 or so. But tonight was the last night for that, now we will
go back to a 9-9 time frame. Which isnt great but not bad. <br>
I just want class to be over with already. Im losing interest in it
all. Which is a bad thing considering this is when it is crunch time. I
really need to start to focus on my studies. I have a 6 page paper due
in like 3 days and I only have an outline. Im thinking that I will do
it last minute like normal. And probably not do to bad on it. At least
I hope so. <br>
It's kinda odd. No one is home right now. Its just dark and quite. A
little cold. Very errie. Kinda of lonly and yet all I feel is a little
bit of anger or frustration. A dark mood to fit my dark atmosphere. <br>
I just keep thinking that I am going to be sitting here and someone
from my family is going push open the front door and walk in. Ruin my
space of darkness that I have grown attached to. I want it all to
myself. No invasion, no hassel, no noise. Just me, just freedom, just
the noise of my fingers tapping against the keys. For some reason it
feels very satisfying to see how fast they can go. They make a sentence
and correct it so quickly that I feel so determined. <br>
The only thing that seems to stop my train of thought that so smoothy
seems to flow is the short tone and a flashing lite at the bottom of my
screen that signals a AIM message. A converstation that I dont mind
having but dont want to make the hassel to go back and forth with.
Everytime I get one letter down I see it pop up again and I am
distracted. <br>
My fingers are cold. I hoped they would have warmed up with all the typing. Not so much so. <br>
So what should I really be doing. Lots more then I am right now. I love when Im lazy but hate it all the same.<br>
I do have to cash the check I just got for demonstarting pilates. It
finally came in. Months later! Then I should start on that paper. But
damn I thought this was suppose to be my easy, doesnt really count,
laid back semseter. I really should clean. Dan called. Should&nbsp;
call him back. Also should go for a run with Justin soon. I have to
make up a ton of french hw that I slacked on. I want to take some
pictures. So many, so little. so..... blah.....<br>
Train of thought.... follow through what runs in ones head. Just from
point to point to point. From the feelings to images. To document what
is ....<br>
My silence has been interupted. It's Over.<br>

this in a sentence today in french so it made more sense then the
common phrase. I also learned that window shopping isnt called window
shopping when literally translated. Its really Window Licking in
french. Just some interesting things the teacher told us today.<br>

"event","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I feel so tired right now. I had a
long day today. Not that long but it was exhuasting. I slept in till
about 10... thats so not a complaint but still felt really tired for
some reason. Then took a long shower and got ready for work. <br>
I was at work by 1pm. Got caught up on what had changed and started on
the glove fixture. Krista had a interveiw of this guy Chris who I had
meet through mutual friends. He is kinda cute. So that whent well I
assume except that he is looking for full time hours and we dont know
if we can give it to him. <br>
I continued all day with the glove fixture and many other little
projects. I kept finding myself destracted and running around the
store. Had some nice conversations with Krista about several things.
Its always nice to talk to her. I see her more then I see my mother and
she is very supportive of me. I love that my boss is as kind as she is.
Then while Krista was about to go in the interview with Chris, Vince
called our DSM. Krista had a breif chat with him were I over heard bits
and pieces. Something about well she is going to be going to Cal State
next semester.... and that meant it was about me... so I decided I
should walk away and continue my work. I dont like to be to nosey she
would tell me about it later Im sure. <br>
And well she did. She said that Vince was looking at my hours and
noticed that I was putting in the minimium for a Full time position and
since there is a lack of an asst. manager that he was considering me to
move up. Krista told me this and I told her I felt flattered. I am
giving the weekend to think about it. But Krista see that it would be
good for me to have the extra money and such. And she see's that I am
already doing the hours and the task of such a position. I told her
that still felt I needed to learn more and that if she thought I could
do it or not meant alot to me. But I am at this point in my life that
is a turning point. <br>
One- I have my AA degree and GE Req. complelted.<br>
Two- I have been accepted to Cal State San Marcos<br>
Three- That means I have to look up taking a loan to support my
schooling and jumping into a non-stop way to debt and never stopping
school<br>
Four- I see myself stuck once I start my semester there on Jan. 17th. I
wont be able to take time off to save or relax or travel. I have been
recently considering taking sometime off to go to Canada... I mean why
not.<br>
Five- Now I am offered a ASM postion at a million dollar store at the age of 20.<br>
Six- I dont know what I want, What I want to do, where I am going to
go... Should I continue with my goal of school... go to cal state and
find some way to study abroad for a semester. Jump into debt and take
the ASM job at Wilsons. <br>
Or do I accept the ASM position as a temporary thing and take some time
off from school. Save and take sometime to travel and live a little on
a whim. It seems that I have so long pursued my goal of cal state and
now that I am about to leap into It I doubt taking that leap due to the
stress of fianaces and lack of life. I want to live. I am 20. I am
young. But so much burden. So many choices. If anyone has a thought let
me know. I could use some support right now. Not to many people that I
can turn to right now....<br>
I feel so lonly.... <br>

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 102);"">I cant help it. It's just to
easy to update when I have something to say. When what I feel so
engulfed about is intoxicating. It's almost a problem that I have. That
this can happen so easily and so fast. To happen so strongly and
swifty. Its such a great feeling. A feeling I cant seem to get away
from when I feel it.&nbsp; Pictures of kisses are now showered in my
mail. How can I resist that affection. This strong temptation to fall
so deep. I cant help but feel guilty at the same time that I am
complicating his life. That he is taking on this extra confusion
because of ""a 20 year old California girl.""&nbsp; The twist that has
seemed to toture him and his life. A wanted touture at that. I try and
convince myself that its superficial that this is only skin deep. That
this seems so romantic yet will it ever progress to something more. The
distance, the age, the relations.... so many things that hold it back
but make it what is. That is what makes this so strong like it is. Its
this quirk to the setup that makes me desire and lust for it more and
more. The craving from within, from his voice, from his words, his
pictures... his face.... to melt in it all. The longing for it all. Can
I feel anymore then I do. Can he? What is it all to come to?<br>
<br>
<br>
So mushy sorry. Hahah on a lighter note he kidded with me about
marrying him.&nbsp; To take me back to Canada to be his wife.... haha
if only!<br>
If anyone is sick of me talking about him say Yah all opposed to the
this discontinuation and would not mind me saying more say Neh. Thanks
for your time. Please come again...<br>

"event","<P><EM>I am glowing all day now. It's great yet terrible. All the thoughts, all the comments and complaments, all the pictures, the phrases, the laughs. I can help but start to feel something for him. The thing is it seems different then before. I am usaully afraid to say to much about how I feel. I dont want to be to forward. But This time its different. He is forward and frank. He is very open to tell me how he feels. He shows it pretty well. An addiction. I cant help it. I think of him so much and I dont feel so guilty about it knowing he does to. Im sure everyone that knows me is sick of hearing about it. He whole band know about me I guesss as I found out tonight. </EM></P>
<P><EM>Oh so last night after I talked to him on the phone, with that sexy voice of his, I came home to find a dozen violet roses in my room. They were from my dad for taking Danny to school for him. He even got me donuts for the morning. If I could have felt any better that night I would have died a happy woman. Showered with so much....</EM></P>
<P><EM>Todays run was good. Im trying to get as healthy as I can. Went the doctors another trying to be as fit as I can. I hopefully will be able to get my work done so I dont stress. I was thinking I might just miss class tomorrow I really dont want to go to much. I mean nothing really important. I just feel little desire to attend. I guess I will see how I feel in the morning. eh&gt;</EM></P>

----- And the latest news..... well he gave me is phone number but I
didnt want to call. Its so much different to talk to a person online
then go to the phone. So I wasnt planning on calling. But he then kept
saying how its weird that he doesnt even know what my voice sounds
like... still wasnt going to call. Instead I ended up giving him my
phone number. But we just kept on talking then when it was about
midnight or so he asked if it would be wierd to call me and say
goodnight. I said no. Then the phone rang..... SHIT is all I can
say.... <br>
So ya.... it was him... and we then talked for about an hour on the
phone.... His voice is so HOT! Oh my god and it was a sracthy because
he insisted on talking to me till 4 am his time. Oh boy..... He said I
sounded like Gwen from No Doubt and I had a California accent.... oh so
many details I cant even explain fully. awh just melt to the sound of
his voice... more later Im sure... <br>
Au Revoir!<br>"

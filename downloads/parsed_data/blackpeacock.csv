<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Role models? Models to play the role of. Standard-bearers to ape and mimic in every&nbsp; way,&nbsp; lest you actually find your way, lest you actually become who you are.&nbsp; The need and even demand for role models in society betrays a weakness, an inability to cope with the&nbsp; unbounded freedom that potentially exists in an individual. Hasn't it ever struck you as suspicious that&nbsp; the authoritarian triumvirate of parents-teachers-government place so much emphasis on following the&nbsp; ""moral example"" of another, completely different person, one with different needs, a&nbsp; different life and&nbsp; different strengths and weaknesses rather than addressing your problems with you in&nbsp; mind,&nbsp; with a&nbsp; remedy catered to your needs? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Would Jesus Do? What Would Michael Jordan do? What would the cast of Friends,&nbsp; Pipi&nbsp; Longstocking or Lakita Garth do? And hey, Where's Waldo? Maybe he's hiding because he&nbsp; doesn't&nbsp; want to be a role model. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's understandable that a lot of entertainers, people whose talent is in making us&nbsp; laugh, cry, or just&nbsp; rock, are reluctant to be role models. Indeed, who wants the high scrutiny of fame&nbsp; (already an&nbsp; aggravating thing) coupled with the burden of being an entire country's appointed leader&nbsp; just because&nbsp; you're face is known everywhere? Mass exposure? That is our sole requirement for ""moral&nbsp; leadership?""&nbsp; Insane.&nbsp; Don't role models make mistakes, go astray and have moments where they are&nbsp; utterly,&nbsp; hopelessly lost in their own personal labyrinth as well? Do they not also struggle with the&nbsp; Minotaurs of fear, addiction, loss,&nbsp; and self-worth as well? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My philosophy is one of self-reliance. Not to think ""what would _______ do in this&nbsp; situation,"" but to&nbsp; think ""what works best for me, here, now?"" That's not to say you can't be inspired by or&nbsp; build on&nbsp; something someone before you did and choose the same options they did. But one does oneself and&nbsp; one's hero a great disservice blindly aping his moral code in place of examining life and phenomena&nbsp; with one's one eyes. Being true to one's Will. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't be a follower; the follower has no will of his own. He subjects himself constantly to&nbsp; the will of&nbsp; society (the rabble) and also to some great, irreproachable Authority, who like the angry&nbsp; God that this mentality gave birth to, must always be pleased by way of human sacrifice. Usually it is&nbsp; oneself that is sacrificed in the name of this angry God: morality, Thou Shalt, WWJD, and my personal&nbsp; favorite,&nbsp; ""because I said so."" The follower belongs to everyone - but himself. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just the same, don't be a leader, at least not in any direct way; only lead people back to&nbsp; themselves.&nbsp; The leader, too, is just a follower of sorts. If he leads his flock astray he is subject to&nbsp; the harshest&nbsp; criticisms and stoned heavily. But perhaps his way was not meant to be yours also? The&nbsp; best way to honor those you are inspired into action by is to break off from them at some point, to&nbsp; concentrate not&nbsp; on how similar you are to them,&nbsp; or putting yourself in their mindset&nbsp; all the time; the best way is to focus on what qualities about yourself are uniquely you.&nbsp; We are all like snowflakes and fingerprints: no 2 of us are exactly alike. Even when we try and be someone else or paint&nbsp; the exact same painting or behave in the same manner, exact duplication remains&nbsp; impossible. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends, the only path worthy of you rare, free spirited ones is the path of solitude,&nbsp; self-examination&nbsp; and self-determination. To spend so much time alone that the pollution of popular opinion&nbsp; and some&nbsp; overhead Authority no longer reaches you. Be your own palm tree, give to yourself that shade away from the hot sun of the herd. Your self and your life are gifts. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role model is a dead end, a hollow idol, an ashen relic from before Now, the one holy moment&nbsp; given to you to change everything about yourselves. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Become who you are! <BR><B></B>&nbsp; </P>

"event","THE WARLOCK AND THE VAMPIRE


One day while walking in the woods
A warlock did verily find
A little she-vamp slumbering
By the river's side
The handsom magiker did stop
And caution did he take
For though she looked ever so small
A meal of him she could make

Then quietly he did creep closer
And thought up a wicked plan
Perhaps he could tame this beast
And prove he was the strongest man
But before he could conjure up a spell
The vampiress did wake
And the warlock wished by gods
For a cross or even a stake

But the she-vamp merely stared
For charmed of him was she
She had hardly seen a handsomer man
And asked him who he might be
Surprise overtook him
For she had a siren's sweet voice
Her eyes a saphire blue did shine
Her face of a child still playing with toys

He told the she-vamp who he was
And she smiled shyly at him
She introduced herself as well
First stretching one, than the other, limb
Her back arching like an animal's
Her mouth opening in a yawn
The warlock likened her to a kitten
And wondered if she'd play with some yarn

""You are so sweet a creature,"" said he
""How could I have thought you'd make me your feast?""
Said she, ""You? My feast?""
""You're no more of a turkey than I am a beast""

Too bad you couldn't take the fun
That life gives away for free

I know you gotta blame someone
So it might as well be me

I learned a long time ago
That you gotta shake hands with pain

Too bad the only thing that you learned
Was a million ways to complain

Oh well, we've gone the mile
You forgot how to smile
Too bad I gotta say
Don't go away mad, just go away

Last night I had a crazy dream that I
Was playing on a real cool team
The sound was just alright and I was scratching
On a leaning tree

Drinkin' alone and pissin' and moanin'
That just ain't my style
Too bad your such a pain in the ass
That you never had a chance at all

"event","This page is in honor of American Warriors, both at home and abroad. 


    We salute the candidates for their amazingly spirited contest and we salute, in the true spirit of America, a Love for the underdog; Senator John Kerry for his incredible efforts to change the course of America in the world. He fought a most valiant and exhausting battle. America will come to regret its mistake. We regret to say we do not share Mr. Bush's views whatsoever, on practically every issue, and we genuinely fear for the safety and the sanity of our divided countrymen now. Europe, Canada and Japan have never loked more enticing. And the band who this site is named for, Warrior Soul (go to www.koryclarke.com), themselves the underdogs; that's why you never heard of them. Now you have.


     Something surprising.
    The fight is not over. In fact it may have only just gotten more interesting. For think about this: Never has a single world superpower had such a globally, universally hated and feared leader as Mr. Bush, at least, not since, perhaps, Roman days. I think Chaos has been ""officially"" and ""cosmically"" sanctioned, and we're only going to see more of it.

    And it is in that spirit that I fiddle as we burn. I hope you don't mind, and even play your pan pipe in tune. 


    This website, In Love and Victory: Warrior Soul, is, and ever shall be, in addition to the band above mentioned, sincerely dedicated to this great country's long history of so called ""losers."" Or those who lost or never had any popular suppport and go unheard:



    + The Native American peoples, for their indomitable bravery, whose just-opened National Museum serves as a reminder that these brave spirits still live here, in and among our rocks and trees and canyons and deserts, and who daily see their land's sorrowful fate. We must begin to listen. wwww.gatheringofnations.com


    + The youth of America, who if they are under 18 will,in four more years of Bush and Cheney, likely have very, very few rights left. I'm reminded of Hitler Youth. Go rent THX 1138 if you want an idea were we are headed. Be very afraid. Then do something. 


    + To the NeoPagans, whose reminder of spirituality in these hollow, materialistic, jingoistic and frantic days shows us how the world's religions and the power of Magick (define it as you wish) still and always will shape the world around and within us. Without them the New Age would be called amongs us mages ""the Golden Age."" I believe we are now in that Golden Age. The tipping point of 2012 is coming, just maybe. www.2012.org
 

    + The Gothic and Freak/Freek ""community"" (Goths will know what I mean by the quotes!)....Keeping radical sel-expressionism and individualism of mind, body and soul alive. We salute the makers of www.GothicPersonals.com and FetischMusic.com, for their fine services in bringing the dark and disenchanted, however colorful or black-clad, a little closer together. I would lonely and be watching the spider webs accumalate were it not for them....


    + The (so to call it) Counterculture, still alive and kicking, bigger and more subtle and powerful than most outsiders in mainstream America think, but, as someone who has never known any culture besides it, I can assure you the dreams of the 1960s 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the New Age, or Aeon of Horus, or Kali-Yuga (whatever!) are not only not going anywhere, they are going to pioneer the next levels of metamorphosis. And first. It's always this way. The Brave always run fearlessly ahead into the unknown; somehow the ""conservative"" thinks his choosing to lay back makes him smarter. It may make him regretful instead.   



    + To the disheartened: I know, I know. My heart is also broken. We have lost the battle. But the tides are changing. The word ""liberal"" has lost all sting. Common, Kerryan sense at least came very close to winning, which means about half of voting Americans will resist the President in his voracious need for more power under his law. Martial Law, many will tell you now. Conspiracy theorists are crapping themselves all over the world as we speak. I'm not so sure; I'll wait and see, and then say it here. 

Thanks for checking out the site. I promise there won't be much politics. I know, we're all pretty fucking sick of it by now. 



in Love and Victory,



~Meph





    P.S. - Yes, this site will be silly-ass laid-back at times, too. :)"

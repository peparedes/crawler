"event","so umm yesterday it would be now... Jack came at 8am and took me to breakfast. we had a long ass talk about everything. he looked at me dead in the eyes and said ""'sorry"". i told him about Jesse. wow he felt so out of place then because there he was and i am dating someone. but i said not too feel like he does, its not like i love jesse. i don't. not so sure if i could ethier, because of reasons. Jack told me that he wanted to be with me and he really learned from his mistakes. He said that he won't give up and that I can take the time I need all the time in the world to decide. I told him I do need to think. So, then I came back home, hugged him and told him goodbye. Then, my mom sat down with me to talk to me about him. She asked me ?'s and just asked how i felt. i told her. after that then she said, amber...you just told me your answer. I left and went to my room, then layed out in the sun, went to work. now what to do. i dont want to hurt anyone at all. this fuckin sucks."

"event","My life has totally changed...not sure for the better or not yet though...
I went on a few dates with Jesse. On April 21st he asked me to be his g/f.
I giggled lol...and was like yeahhh...
The other day Jack called me. He apologized for being an asshole and said that if I still hated him that he would understand. I said nothing to that.
I realized tho that it was so much easier to be mad, upset, and angry with him when he was sooo many miles away. I mean I still am, but it was much easier to do that and so much easier to ignore him too. Now, it's hard to. I liked hearing his voice and him calling himself all those names I thought and said about him lol. He's been calling me now everyday. I can't help but crack a little smile when he calls me. I try not to, but it just happens. Then, the other night I just bawled myself to sleep. Damn it, I was being so strong too haha. I cried last night too. Geez...
He might be coming home this weekend. Not sure if he will actually come here to my house and see me or not. If he does, I don't know what to do. It's going to be so weird, but good to see him at the same time too. Is that so wrong???...I still have feelings for him so much. 
Why does this all have to happen when I get a boyfriend. So typical that it does to me. I swear. Now I am just scared I guess. About it all. 
I just have to take one day at a time I guess. I really don't know what else to do to tell you the truth."

"event","OMG...so I had such a good weekend...well actually a great Saturday night.
I got drunk off my ass. I haven't drank since freakin like July or August. 
I drank 7 beers and I couldn't really walk lol. 
I thought it would be funny to run behind trees and see if Janet, Jesse, Brian, Jeremy, or Matt could find me. They had the flashlight so freakin everytime I ran to another tree they caught me. DAMN IT!!!
I went to go pee at the outhouse. I got lost. I went up the wrong lil hill then just kept going lol...dumbass!
Then, the damn fuckin bottles wouldn't stay up on the thing. I kept picking them up over and over and over and OVER again... UGGGHHHH damn things. 
I had a blast though. It was fun.
At the end of the night even though I thought I was gonna throw up, Jesse told me that he liked me. I hugged and kissed him on the cheek.. THEN OMG he kissed me on the lips. haha. Then, Janet had to drive my moms car back to my house cause I could barely keep my damn eyes open. haah. 
CRAZY ASS FUCKIN NIGHT!!!

I LOVE YOU HUMPEE.....NO WONDER YOUR MY NICOLE..... AND MYY BIIITTCCHHHHH!!!

Nothing really has been goin on in my life at the moment.
I went on a date with this Mike kid, he is 20. But he turned out to be a complete player and it was one of the worst dates ever I've been on lol. I'm not even going there.
This past Sunday I was in a Fashion Show. It was Ashley's Aunt's bridal shop and she was showing some dresses and I was one of the girls that did. I showed a bridal gown and a prom gown. It was a lot of fun and now I can actually say, ""hey, I've walked the *CatWalk*"" lol. 
Monday was a fun day spent with my humpee. We went to J-town for the day. We bought awesome coats but different colors, mine is black, she got the white one. We are like pimpin it out lol. I also bought 2 tanks for summer and a new wallet and we both bought 2 matchin purses but different colors. We went to Lonestar, so she took my virginity for there. haha! But yeah, we are so awesome. It was fun and it was just me and her which made it a lot cooler too. 
Tuesday a resident passed away that morning. Then, later that night by bro called my mom and I and my mom had to call 911 cause he wouldn't for my dad. He has been sick for a few days and he was  dizzy and his hands were numb and he couldn't really move. So, ambulance came and got him. We got to go though at about midnight to get him and bring him home. Seems to be doing better. He was dehydrated and has Broncitis I guess. So glad he's okay. 
Today went back into work, another resident passed away. geez. I hope no more.
Well, all I have to say is I can't wait until this damn weekend. I am off. I hope it will be a great one. Better be. So people make it one for me lol.

I was like WTF just freakin wave or stop and say hello instead of just staring at me. I don't even know why they don't like me anymore, it makes no sense, because me and her were best friends, and me and him were pretty good friends, then just sometime between not this past summer but the one before last, after it, they chatted a little, then somewhere in between or something they decided not to like me.

Good for him. BUT, why he is still sending me signals and saying certain things to me...that he wants to like be with me. I think the other day he wanted to kiss me, I could tell just by the way he was looking at me and talking to me and acting. But, he didn't. Too shy probably. We talk so long anymore and so personal to each other. It's so weird, we went from talking maybe 2 words to each other and smiling at each other to talking about whatever is on our minds and flirting so much without even realizing it and hugging one another and wanting to kiss. I know it sounds bad on both our parts because we are each with someone. But, this is one of the things that we just can't help ourselves. We are so infatuated with one another. I want to tell Jack all about this just not right now, cause he is over in Korea and he's paranoid enough about Reggie deal so...yeah, but when he comes home, I'll let him know every thing about Josh."

Laura needed to go to bank, one in Clymer Out of Service so we were on our way to the other one. We were going down Tahoma Rd. There was this car coming the other way with it's HIGH DAMN BEAMS on...I could't see shit, ethier could Devin or Laura. I started to slow down so I can go past him cause it looked like he was slowing down or soemthing and before I know it BAM!!! BLACK OUT! BRAKES! OUT OF CAR!... What happened 4 mins before we got there. A bronco had got hit and flipped onto it's side, everyone got out not injured. No lights on there they shut them off, so I only seen the high beams, nothing else...then BAM we hit into the Bronco. I blacked out as soos as we hit it for a brief second then I woke up hearing someone yelling, gas is leaking! Laura saying, get out of the car. SO we all get out of the car. We spun around when I blacked out for that second and then put on the brakes and luckily I did because we were a foot away from going off the bank with a pond below. I was shakin so badly and crying. I called my mom and my sister and dad. My sister was bawling with me. I couldn't believe what had happened. I was in SHOCK! No one injured really. My left thumb hurts a little, it was really swelled now it's goin down, it's black and blue though. My left knee hurts a little too, it's a lil black and blue, and my right thumb got scrapped. Laura's neck and chest hurts. Devin's head hurts and his right knee that is a little swelled and scraped up. He hit his head off the window and it shattered the window. We were all veyr lucky and very lucky we didnt make it over th bank too. I am glad we are all okay. !!! I don't know what I would have done if both or ethier one would have died or got badly injured. Well, that was my night and then my feet got froze from standing outside in the cold for like an hour or so waiting for the cop to do all the paper work shit so yeah...I am going to bed now, it's 2:17am and I am tired and glad to be here and okay and still a little shookin up.

We got to go through the whole entire way through Security and everything and sit with him for a little bit waiting for his plane. Then.....said a REALL SAD BYE!!!...I cried and he had a few tears too. He walked away. I didn't look back, couldn't. His mom held me as I bawled! Then, came back home. Arrived home at 7:00am. Missing him so much!!!
At 11:00am got a call from Jack. He was in New York at JFK Airport about to board the plane and just wanted to tell me he missed n loved me!
Now...Work tonight 3-11 oh freakin joy!"

              Jack and I went to the movies tonight. Before that we went to eat at Wendy's in mall. Then, he took me Christmas shopping. He got me a new winter coat, a DVD, and a shirt. Total Cost:$103 about...lol. but yeah he wanted to soooo...then, we went to the movies. We seen ""Yours, Mine, & Ours"" It was a pretty good, funny movie. The best part was, we had the movie theater to ourselves. There was NO ONE there at all. It was cool. We sat in the back. I took off my shoes and just made myself comfortable as well did he. It was a nice, comforting night. Sucks tomorrow back to work...3-11 tomorrow night, 3-8:30 Friday then hanging with Jack afterwards. Sat & Sun though I get off! YES!!!

"event","I went to Maryland...ended up going. Mostly because I wanted to see Jack and even though he did hurt me I just had to go and see him and be with him. I ended up having a really good time actually. I met a lot of his family. Aunts and Uncles and a few cousins too. They are all pretty nice and his uncles are hilarious. Wednesday night Jack and I did talk about everything and he told me all what happened and it was very sad and upsetting. I cried. He cried. I think he realized that I really do care for him and really do want to be with him. I hope he knows that I know I told him over and over again for the past couple days so lol and he has to me too. We aren't great, but we are doing good, and thats fine with me. He talked to a couple of his Uncle's about it too and his sister. They all gave him hell for it too haha!!! I adore his sister we went Friday to her house. Went out with her and her boyfriend. Ate food and his sister slipt me some Roman Coke lol. It was fun! I am glad I went. I am happy that we talked about everything and are trying to work everything out too for us. This week we are going to go to the movies and out to eat and he is taking me shopping!!!!!!! YES!!! I deserve it! Don't ya think? lol. I just hope everything works out is all. I almost fell asleep last night at work cause I was so tired from traveling and only getting 3 hours of sleep the night before lol. But, whatever. Jack called me up this smorning to see how I was doing and told me his missed me already. He is going hunting tomorrow morning. so RUN DEER RUN!!! Well, I think this is all for now I'm out I am going to get something to eat and get ready for another day of working 8 hours oh joy!!! later"

"event","Went to the Humane Society today...I want a little puppy so bad. I REALLY want a minature Doberman. 2nd choice is either Chiuaha or Pomerian, 3rd choice is a Schnazu. Can't find none of them :( sucks ass!

Tonight I started to work on my scrap book, got some of his done tonight. Which was really hard to do considering...
Some days I just feel like I can go on but some days like today I just can't. I don't really know why that is either, doesn't really make sense. I guess I just don't want to let go maybe?. I don't know. I really try to at times. Then, I can't or just don't want to. I miss him so much. I can't explain it. I just wish I could turn back time and do things over again knowning that it would turn out like it is, because then I wouldn't of done what I did or even thought of it. BUt you can't, you got to deal with the mistakes and learn from them. I have learned enough from that but still paying for it and will for the rest of my life. I mean who else is like this? I wish I knew someone else like this maybe they could help me in some way. who knows.

Well, Jack called me tonight. I really need to talk to him about all this even though I have once before and it hurt him but the conversation about it that I thought was over is not and I just think he should know more and how I really feel about the whole thing. I feel so bad cause he cares about me so much and I care about him too it's just...well I don't know... anyways he is goin to be home in 8 days. wow. hopefully it will take my mind off of things and I can just spend time with him and maybe try and give into him more than I ever have to get away from my constant pain of the past."

"event","Well, my weekend wasn't so bad. Friday I had work till 8:30 and didn't do anything afterwards, just hung out with my brother and Kel-Kel and went to Clymer but that's it. Saturday my brother, Kel-Kel, and I went into town. I had to get more mintues on my cell, pick up a few things. Didn't see anyone there...got home, sat around waiting for Laura to call me. She did and told me about a little party up at George's but the thing was my bro couldn't go there cause George's dad doesn't like him or something. So, I just quickly went up there to see Laura for a few mins and then left planning to go back for her in an hour cause she wanted me to. So, we were going to go down the road and drink cause I really needed one. lol. But, no one was there, and they ended up goin to George's house. I heard yelling down by the woods and it sounded like ethier Jasper or Jesse. Then, seen someone pill off onto highway then about 10 mins later the fire whistle went off and they went the same way. So, I was frightened that it might of been Laura or something so my bro, Kel-Kel, and I went to go see, but then when we were on our way I seen 2 people walking on the side of the road and it was Douglas and some Tyler kid. I took them back to George's and ended up staying there for a couple hours and bro came too. It was kind of boring. But, when I got there, I got really happy welcomings from Terra, Jasper, and my old buddy Tyler. So that was comforting. That brought a smile to my face...anyways, then Jasper got out of hand and wanted to beat up Big Fat Dave for getting him dirty it was so stupid. Doug and I were yelling at him and trying to hold him back. Then, he calmed down and I was going to take Jasper and Doug home and then Jasper started up again, and then as I was trying to push him up the way, he whamped me on the left side of my jaw. Luckily, it left no mark lol. But yeah. That was my crazy night lol. Got home and went to bed. I had a weird but somewhat interesting dream about someone but not going to say who and I just don't understand why I did but yeah. lol. Anyways, Laura ended up goin to the party after a lil while at George's to the one down the road and did not bother to call me up but whatever. Sunday I watched the football game. STEELERS WON!!!! HELL YEAH! that made my day. 
Tonight at work it fuckin sucked ass (Monday) just was boring and I had to do pills ontop of my other work so yeah...and then I was just all stressed out about shit...my life! I just am in this place and I can't move out of it I am really stuck. It seems like more things keep coming into my life now too, I don't know, I can't make any sense of anything at all anymore and it sucks so bad because it just scares me it really does. I got no one to talk to about it ethier well my friends but I don't know I just don't want to talk to them about it I guess cause I really don't know where to begin and I am not even sure that they can even help me in any way ethier. UGh I just...I don't know.

"event","From time to time I stop and think about how my life is going. How is it going now that I actually stopped and thought about everything that is going on in my life or has in the past one or two years. Well, not so good. It is not at all what I planned my life to be like no where near it. Sometimes I don't really see everything in front of me or I just mis interpet it all in different kinds of ways. I always think about what has happened in the past and what I would of done different if given the chance. But you don't get that chance, you just have to take it as it happened. I have regrets in my life and that is something that I didn't ever want. But, one top of that all it has made me the person that I am today. I like it sometimes, but other times I don't but I am the only one that can change that nobody else. I've really just always punished myself and never forgave myself for something I did a couple years ago. I bet my life would be so different and diffinetly less confusing if it would have been different but it wasn't. Lately, I have been thinking a lot about *love* you know it is so powerful and such a great feeling. Have I ever loved someone? Yes! More than anyone knows. At the time I really didn't know that I did love this person but when I finally realized it, well, it was too late. So many people out in the world get second chances but I surely didn't. I look at people I have been with since then and now. He is just not like them at all. He is a totally different person all together. He is the only person that never made me confused about life and second guess myself. He is the only person that made me feel something that no other guy has ever made me feel. I just wish I could prove to him that I would never hurt him, that he can in deed trust me a hundred percent, and I would give him anything that he could ever ask for. I know deep down in my heart that my life today would be different and better if he would have given me another chance or if I didn't fuck it up. My life would not be so confusing and I know I wouldn't be so damn stuck like I have been for such a damn long time. I just know it in my heart. But, guess what? I'm stuck and I always will be. Yeah, I might get by, find someone or maybe I have already, but I truely know that he will always be a part of me, always be in my heart and in my mind, and I know that he is the only one who doesn't make anything in life look or seem so confusing. I'll always be stuck in my heart. I can't change that, but what I can change is to try harder to make myself a better person that I know I can be without him, just not a great person, but a good person is better than nothing right? I hope so. I really do."

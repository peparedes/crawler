"event","<center>For some reason I don't feel like the same guy anymore.  I feel new and if feels so good.  I finally left some things in the past and decided to move on and I feel like ive changed.  I stayed at the beach all last week except tuesday night and wends morning.  It was really awesome cause I met alot of people.  Plus I met a bunch of chicks.  I met a chick named Vanessa who was really hot, and she played Violin which adds to the hotness.  But she was 24 and im 18 so that would never work.  Older girls are always attracted to me and they always say that Im too young.  I can never get a chick that is my age.  I went to a house party one of those days and met alot of people there too.  I went and played guitar and was the life of the party for about 30 minutes.  Then I stayed around and drank a bit and left.  Some chick wanted my number so of couse I gave it to her.  The only problem is that she was 20...see what I mean?!  If only I was a few years older.  I can't wait to freakin get famous.  I want to meet all the hot rock stars like Avril Lavigne and such.  I wanna be able to get on the damn stage, play our own music, and reach out to the fans.  I like day dream about it everyday.  I think we can pull it off, but I wanna make it fast cause once I go to college its gonna mess my schedule up!  
Well I go to busch gardens in 2 more days (Counting today).  Im going with Randy and his sister Jessie.  Jessie is so damn cool.  Shes not bringing her boyfriend, but hes a kick ass guy too.  They are great to party with.  Randy is just cool.  Im outta here for now.  Im like 80% done with me cold so Im gonna go juice up on some medication.  Later!<center>"

"event","<center>I just recently found out that im in the hole <b>$94!</b>  Somehow, I spent all my money on my debit card and now owe money.  School is so close to ending...and I can't wait.  Me and my friend Michael are going to go check out some apartments tomorrow.  Hes responsible and can pay his rent so there is no problem rooming with him.  Today has been such a boring ass day.  Ive sat around and played Warcraft 3 all fricken day.  Its a really awesome game, but damn, it does get boring really fast!  Well there really isn't much more I can say, so I guess im getting off right now.  Ill write again sometime soon!<p><a href=""http://boygasm.net/quizzes/famguy/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://boygasm.net/quizzes/famguy/quagmire1.gif""></a><br>Which Family Guy Character are you?

"event","<center>I so hate school...but there is just a few more days left!  =D!  I was planning on getting a few good hours of sleep in school but we had the ""Awards Ceremony"" (the thing where the same people every freaking year get the same awards).  I do nothing in school all day.  I go to school, sit in first period, bell rings, sit in English and nap, bell rings, homeroom I eat, bell rings, break time, bell rings, study hall, bell rings, study hall, bell rings, lunch, bell rings, yearbook, bell rings, math...what a day...what a day...most people would die for my schedule but ITS NOT COOL AT ALL PEOPLE!  My band might have a new bassist.  A guy named Chase came down from Alaska to live with his grandparents and he plays bass well.  We play this friday at the ""Relay 4 Life"".  Lately I just havent really felt right for some reason.  I need to get back in the groove of things.  Its the end of the year and I finally graduate and I gotta leave alot of people behind.  Some people I want to see left behind, some I don't.  So we will see how that all works out.  I've started watching Scarface...what a awesome movie.  ""Whats ya name?""...""Tony Montana"".  Spelling probably isn't right but um...<b>I DONT CARE CAUSE I LIKE THAT QUOTE!</b>  Well there is so much to say, but look, I don't really feel like typing much more, so ill just have to save that for tomorrow...if I write tomorrow which I most likely won't!  So take care, and don't sniff coke!</center>"

"event","<center>Another day, another dollar.  I worked today (<b>for those who don't know, I work at Resort Quest Outerbanks cleaning summer cottages</b>!) and made $207 dollars.  Thats not bad at all!  Plus its added to another $202 I made last sunday.  I can finally get a little cash flow going again.  Going 2 <b>f*(&#$^</b> weeks with no money really sucks.  I had to take my bro to the airport yesterday.  I woke up at 2:00am, drove to Raleigh (2 and a half hour ride), dropped him off and went to sleep in the mall parking lot.  My friends Randy and Gavin went with me.  Of course, it took us about an hour and a half to find a place to sleep and didnt manage to sleep until about 6:00am.  I woke up and me and my friends went inside the mall to eat breakfast at mcdonalds.  Then we decided to go check out the guitar shop (<b>one of my favorite places in THE WORLD)</b>.  I think that was a bad idea.  1. It took us a whole our to get there, when it was only 10 minutes away from where we orginally were.  2.  I turned down a one way street in downtown and almost hit 4 cars.  3.  Ran a red light and almost got plowed into  4.  We circled all of raleigh, just because I made one wrong turn...<br>
After the guitar shop, I met up with one of my best-est friends and who I like to call -----====My Sister====-----.  She looks out for me and all and has always been there for me.  We went and ate lunch and went shopping for a few, then came back home.  Btw, I forgot to say that her name is Jennifer.<br>
This is basically the last week of school and it starts monday...now its time to start looking for college.  Maybe I will, maybe I won't.  Most likely the 2nd one because Im kinda lazy right now.  Lol.  </center>"

"event","<b>Life In General</b> right now...it pretty much sucks.  For some reason I can't go a period in time without feeling depressed or down.  My brother has been down from Montana for a week and a few days, and its almost as if I want him to go home.  He could honestly care less about some of the things he does.  Its the same old deal with me as usual...alone and bored.  I try to write music but can't.  The stuff on paper I write I regret and plus you really can't play that kind of much around here.  My band played at the ""May Day"" festival...we bombed...I got on stage and just really didn't feel like playing.  Thats a whole other story tho.  Im going to my friends right now...I'll write again someday, sometime..."

"event","<center>Oh Joe dirt, how you are so wrong!  Lol.  Well nothin is really goin on much in my life.  Pretty damn boring.  Military Ball is this friday and I have no date (just like my prom was).  Oh well, I should be able to find someone by then.  I give my senior project presentation tomorrow.  How fun that will be!  Everyone is stressin over it I guess you could say, but i could honestly care less.  It's no big deal.  Hopefully I will have some more to write tonight.  Right now I just decided I would write because I made my account a few days ago but never wrote!  Anyways, peace out!"

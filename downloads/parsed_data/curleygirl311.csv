Thank God I don't have to deal with her drama anymore.  Yes she made accusations about me but do I care...ummm...nope not really.  I realized that she has pretentions about me already set in her head whether they are true or not.  She has her so called ""friends"" and she can keep the drama and delusions to herself.
She thinks I stopped talking to her because of a boy...hahaha...like I am that shallow!  I stopped talking to her because of her drama and her attitude.  I decided to rid my life of negative energy and that is what she was...negative energy.
I tried to make an effort but oh well.  
YAY FOR REAL FRIENDS THAT AREN'T DELUSIONAL!!!!!!"

School is kicking my butt and Old Navy owns my soul.  
Helio was adorable on Channel 13.  Unfortunately I have switched completely out of race mode and into football mode.  It's sad I know but on the bright side MY COLTS ARE STILL UNDEFEATED!!!!!
I went to Purdue last weekend to watch them get slaughtered by Iowa fans and I came to a couple conclusions.
#1-Iowa fans are annoying.
#2-Brother and his friends are extremely entertaining.
#3-I miss FSU.  I miss the football and the friends.
Jessie turns 21 next Tuesday.  I don't know if the world is ready for that...haha.  I wish I could help her celebrate but there is sooo much going on right now (ie school).  Hopefully I can make an appearance.
26 days until 311 @ Purdue!!!!"

Things have been pretty boring.  School is in full swing and it is kicking my butt.  I have no time for anything.....aaagh.  I do nothing but go to school and work.  Like I said things have been boring.
I still am after the same guy I have been affter all summer.  I can't help it...there is just something about him.
The Colts are undefeated.  This makes me extremely happy.  :)
It is a beautiful day out today and I have to waste it by going to work.  Yucky!

"event","Last night Court, my cous Danelle, and Ben took a fabulous roadtrip.  We ended up in Fairdale, KY.  Take my advice...don't ever go there!  We went down to see my friends band Presence.  They are from Tally and I haven't seen them in 3 years.  It was great.  They had no idea that I was coming and I got to surprise the crap out of them.  The looks on their faces were priceless.  It was so great to see them.   It was like a little piece of Tally in the midwest.  Since I have seen them, Dan and DJ have both gotten married and DJ had a little boy.  I wasn't shocked by the news about Dan but DJ's did shock me a bit.  DJ gave me a backstage pass just in case I want to come to any of the other shows for the rest of the year.  Which knowing me I will try to get to a couple.  He also told me that they might be touring with my favorite band in the spring.  I would be sooooo excited if that works out.  I will definitely travel to a lot of those.

Speaking of which....311 announced yesterday that they will play at Purdue on November 8th.  That so happens to be my girl Daphne's 21st bday so I am going to try to talk her into coming to Indy for it.  I am a good birthday coordinator...hehe.

Les and I then went and picked up Creighton and met Kassie and the new Cheeseburger on the north side for a little Five Apples.  It was great to see them cause I haven't seen them since the beginning of the summer.

Movie in the Courtyard was a huge success.  Thank you to everyone that helped out.  Let's hope that the Concert in the Courtyard next Thursday does just as well.

Tonight I am heading to Louisville for a little road trip.  My favorite band from Tallahassee (Presence) is playing there tonight.  I haven't seen them in 2 and a half years so I am going through major withdrawal.

"event","I thought I should say a little something about the devastation our country and more importantly New Orleans is facing.  I have found myself glued to CNN since Sunday night.  Yeah at first I started watching because CNN sent Anderson Cooper into the hurricane but then I realized the devastation that this hurricane could and was going to bring.  I have been in an utter state of shock all week, watching the news every chance I can get.  I can't even imagine what those people are going through.  It is basically Lord of the Flies down there.  I wish that there was something more that I could do.  All I can do is donate money, not that I have any but I have more than they do right now.  

I am one of the lucky ones who got to enjoy New Orleans before its destruction.  I have gone to New Orleans for Spring Break every year pretty much since 2002.  I was planning on going down again this year but that is obviously not happening.  I just hope that 311 has 3-11 day somewhere else this year with all the proceeds going to the rebuilding of one of America's neatest cities.  New Orleans is my favorite city in the US that I have been to.  Sure it was dirty and poor but it was spiritual and magical at the same time.

I beg of you to keep all the victims in your prayers and do what you can to help."

Friday night I met up with Greg and ended up going out with him and Blake Shelton.  It was so much fun and Blake absolutely cracks stuff up.  I ended up getting home at about 4:30 am which sucked because I turned around and left at 4:45 am for the airport so I could catch my 6am fligt to San Fransisco.

San Fransisco was so pretty.  The scenery as we were driving over the Golden Gate Bridge absolutely took my breath away.

I went out with Nick on Saturday night.  I had a lot of fun.  I ate sushi...which if you know me at all you know is a huge deal.  There is nothing better than watching 3 grown men doing sake bombs all night...hehehehe.

The race on Sunday was a pretty good race.  I have never been to a road course before and I loved the course at Sonoma.  That area of Cali is just great.  It wasn't a good day for Tomas or Briscoe though.  I also think that it was very unprofessional of Miss Patrick to make the comments she did during her interview.  Congrats to TK on his win.

Today I spent my day in class, work, and teeter tottering.  Yes that's right.  I said teeter tottering.  My sorority sponsored a teeter totterathon for Riley Hospital.  We teeter tottered for 36 hours straight taking donations for Riley.  It was pretty fun."

Let me start with last weekend.  Last weekend was the Kentucky race.  I went down on Saturday night and stayed at the Belterra.  I hung out with a couple of old ""friends"" and things got pretty interesting.  Sunday was the race and it was an awesome one.  My driver (Scott Sharp) kicked some booty and drove away with the checkered flag.  My grams and I were pretty happy.  

Sunday night a recieved a very random drunk dial from Nick.  It was nice to talk to him even though it took him being smashed to talk to me.  Boo on boys!

Monday I decided to take off and drive to Cincinatti to see 311 again.  It was an amazing show of course.  I have now seen them 10 times...woohoo!  We had great seats and the best part is that they played a completely different set list than they did in Chicago.  Here is the Cincy set list so you all can be jealous hahaha.

Tuesday I bought the new 311 album ""Don't Tread on Me"" which you all must do.  Trust me it is awesome.  I also got a limited edition 311 vinyl.  I got the last one in Indianapolis...hahahaha!  That night I hit up the best time of the summer in Indiana...the State Fair.  I went with Kassie, Waggle, and Court to see Dierks Bentley.

Wednesday night I went back to the fair with Arie.  The whole purpose of this trip was to eat and to see the World's Largest Swine.  The World's Largest Swine happens to have the World's Largest Swine's testicles.  Here I took a pic for you.
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y105/curleygirl311/P1010042.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

8. Lemon Shake Up (both nights)

I better watch out or I will become the World's Largest Swine hahaha.

Thursday night I went to the movies with Brad.  We went and saw Four Brothers.  It was a pretty good movie.  I mean come on...how can you go wrong with Marky Mark, Andre 3000, and the cute guy from Sports Night.  It was a lot of fun to hang out with Brad.  That is twice in one week...whoa...haha.

Last night I went to the movies with Court and Nicole.  We went and saw The 40 Year Old Virgin.  OMG!  This is the funniest movie.  I swear I almost peed my pants because I laughed so hard.  It has the best ending to a movie EVER!  You must go see it!

Tonight I went to the COLTS game.  We lost but it's cool cause it just tells us that our third string sucks worst than Chicago's 3rd sring...hahaha.  Sorgi did a pretty darn good job though and so did our defense.  There is even a new Colt I like.  I will tell you who it is later because I am not sure what his name right now...haha.

It has been a busy week...so if I have neglected you I am sorry."

She took me to a bar called The Buzz where we hung with all her Ruby Tuesday buddies.  OMG there is this guy she works with that is absolutely gorgeous.  He is blond too which is weird cause I don't usually like blond guys (unless their last name is Hexum or Briscoe).  
I got my work schedule today and found out that I have Monday off.  This is great because now I can go to the 311 show in Cincy Monday night.  I can't wait!  
Well I am off to Kentucky now for the race.

I can't wait until 8/16 when the new album comes out.  That's right 8/16...like the song!
You should all be sad that you weren't there!  :)"

The special effects and stuff were cool but overall I did not like it.  Really the only super thing about it was the fact that both Vince Vaughn and Adam Brody were in it.  It just made me hate Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie even more.  I hope that Jennifer Aniston has had sex with Vince Vaughn cause that would be awesome!

Diana took Creighton and I back to Pizza Express to get our cars and the awesome Pizza Express guy gave us free breadsticks!  FREE BREADSTICKS ROCK!

I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow to prepare myself for Chicago.

1 1/2 days and counting until I get to see my 311!"

I went to see Batman Begins with Creighton and Ben.  I loved it!  It made me realize that I have a thing for EVIL men!  I mean think about it.  Joaquin Pheonix in Gladiator.  Hayden Christensen in Episode III.  And now Cillian Murphy in Batman.  Ok maybe they aren't evil all the time but it is their evil roles that make me fall in love with them.  Cillian eyes are amazing.

After Batman, Ben and I ventured to the Unicorn club with our friend Paul to see Tim spin.  It was so much fun.  It was $5 all you can drink, a drag show, and male strippers.  In other words it was awesome.  There was this one stripper who was absolutely gorgeous!  
After that we went to another club to dance.  Ben was trashed by that point and we ran into Thane.  
Words just can't describe the fun!"

I got 2 new CD's this week.  Both of which I absolutely love.  I got GIVE UP by The Postal Service and the new Better than Ezra.

I found out the glorious news that the Kaiser Chiefs will be on tour in October with the Foo Fighters and Weezer.  Of course they are not coming to Indy but they will be in Chicago, Champaign, Columbus, and Cleveland.  Hey maybe they decided to only hit cities whose names began with a ""C.""

I am so excited.  I just saw a commercial for Arizona jeans and they used a Kaiser Chiefs song in it.  Yay!  I heart the Kaiser Chiefs.

I am going tonight to the movies with Aaron.  I am happy about this cause I have missed my Aaron time.  I am not sure if his gf is coming with us or not.  I would like her to because I haven't really gotten to know her yet.

The countdown has begun for the best part of my summer.  One week from tomorrow some friends and I are venturing to Chicago to see 311.  I can't wait.  It will be good times."

Being Twenty-something - they call it the ""Quarter-life Crisis. It is
when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that
there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not
like.



You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or
two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.



You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those
friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the
greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch
with are some of the most important ones.



What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and
aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as
confused as you.



You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought
you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job! and realizing
that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.



Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and
find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize
that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly
adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't.



One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and
cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared
and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on
to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting
further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where
you are or move forward.



You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do
such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet
anyone decent enough that you want to get to know ! better. Or maybe you
love someone but love someone else too and can not figure out why you
are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person. One
night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted
and acting like an idiot don't seem as fun.



You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk
with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to
make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a
life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right
now you'd just like to be a contender!



What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. 
We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as
we can to figure this whole thing out."

Diana picked me up from work and we headed to the Murat.  We had time to kill so we sat in her car and drank,,,ummm juice...haha.  
The concert was amazing.  I heart the KILLERS!  The band that opened for them (Conner) wasn't bad either.  The KILLERS totally tore it up though.  I am sooo glad that I got to go.  I am also glad that I went with Diana too.  She hadn't been to a concert with just the girls in a while.  Lets just say that I don't have much of a voice today from all the yelling I did.
After the concert we walked to Arie's and then went to Nicky Blaines.  We all got a little trashed so if I drunk dialed you I am sorry...hahaha.  I think I drunk dialed almost everyone in my cell.  Ooops.
As far as the bad portion of the night goes....I am over it.  I am completely and udderly over it!

I am still sad that I am not in Milwaukee.  Ryan got in a wreck this morning.  Jess said he hit the wall pretty hard but he is ok.  Thank goodness.

"event","Ok I was flippin through the channels on my tv, as I often do, when I came across the Home Shopping Network.  Normally this channel does not catch my eye but on this night in July they are selling Christmas crap.  What the heck?!  I for one do not want to think about Christmas when it is 90 degrees outside.

I went and saw the new puppy.  He is the cutest thing EVER!  There will be pictures soon.

I added 370 new songs to my iTunes library tonight.  Yay!  I now have 4460 songs.  That is 11 days, 20 hours, 42 minutes, and 53 seconds of wonderful music.

Here is some good news....I got KILLERS tickets.  I am so excited.  The show sold out so I turned to my lovely friend ebay.  Diana and I are going and we are going to ROCK OUT!  I can't wait to see his beautiful sparkliness!"

"event","I just wanted to say Congrats to Nick!  This weekend he headed up to Chicago to race in the world famous MAC race.  I just got word that they made it safely to Mac Island today.  They also did it in the smallest boat ever to attempt the race.  Good job guys!

This is the email I recieved courtesy of the IUPUI sailing club listserv....
I wanted to let everyone know that Chris, Joe, Christian, and Nick from our 
sailing team have all made is safely to Mac Island. They completed the longest 
fresh water race in the world in a boat that is only 24feet long (Melges 24). 
Congrats to the guys, who recieved a standing ovation when they entered the 
harbor just minutes ago... 

This is one of the few, if not the first time, that a 24foot boat has completed 
the Mac Race. (It is illegal to enter the race in a boat under 30feet, for 
safety reasons) Such an awesome accomplishment....I look forward to hearing 
more about their journey which began 12:00pm Saturday and ended around 4:30pm 
today. I guess they had horrible weather last night, as a storm thrashed the 
sails, which destroyed a spinnaker in their ""unofficial"" success to complete 
the the Mac."

"event","WTF.. is with people all of a sudden needing sleep I mean really. I work with kids all day and I still can go through a whole night without sleep and I cant understand why for some reason I feel so damn empty and so damn alone. I went to go see mike kev and britt tonight hoping that they at least would be awake. But they were all tucked in readdy to go to sleep and Im the only one that is still kicking. Maybe this is why I dont feel like I cant deal with some of the crazy shit in my life. Like for example today I froze at work while breaking up a fight that was happening. I think that I an loosing my ability to stick up for what I believe in. I feel like for some reason I seem to let people walk all ove me and around them Im really passive and just like ok. Thats mot me... I dont think. Like Im not a pushover and I resent people that think they scare me and yet I play into it. Whats going on with me. I seem to be filled with so much fear and terror of so many things. People Mikey may be loosing it. What to do about this? I ask myself... I think I need to go off and find myself, or some shit."

I felt like Someone was on top of me and like there was someone pressing down on me and I had this feeling like I was going to be killed. I was hearing things and seeing things the thnng that bothered me the most was the fact that I was seeing my roommate kill me and beat the life outa me. Ok So I know that I was probably just seeing things but I have never had that happen. God I hope that this doesnt happen to me."

Well two reasons: One is because I am the head grounds Keeper and so I have to keep everything looking nice and two because I have bills to pay. So any way when I got to work I ended up rideing the tractor and then in the middle of the lawn big lawn it shut off because there is no gas. So I had to push the big ass tracter all the was to the barn across a bigg hill. Fun.... NOT then I started walking home 5-8 miles and then got flicked off by a truck driver and several people tried to hit me with there cars. So then I called Aroura and Kev and they picked me up and I finally got home and I dont know what Im feeling so yeah that was my day."

Also im happy to tell you that my roommate did not have to get the cattleprod out to get her to roll over in the bed. Ho well I just hope the phrase once you go fat youll never go back isnt true.

Last night I was not doing so well I was actually in a really bad state of mind and the events of lats night did not help it. I guess that Im letting my envy get the best of me and I may or may not be falling into the same state of mind. I wrote my real mom A letter last night and got out how I felt about being gay and how I was sorry the I was a fuck up because of it. But Oh well I guess the I should just move on with things. 

I went to work today and served about 110 people during lunch. Kev stoped but and had lunch with my boss so that was cool... I think idk it sucks that I wasnt able to hang with him. But since Aquaduct is a cristian run place and this was new lifes a company good bye thing kev got prayed for. He lucky god sure as hell never listened to my prayers but then agean who would Im just the gay guy. But Im looking on the bright side I got plenty of hours in today and my pay check this friday will be big."

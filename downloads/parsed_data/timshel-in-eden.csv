"event","She told me that sometimes all she wanted to do was scream while seconds later all she could think of doing was falling into a puddle of tears and collapse sobbing.  I asked her why she was so emotional and she looked at me with questioning, empty eyes and said, ""what do you mean?""  Then she smiled and walked away with a certain bounce to her step.

He had a look about him, a little too sure of himself so that you weren't sure whether he was honestly cocky or really just a little too unself-assured.  It let him act a little crazy sometimes and a little wild at other times.  But then came the crash into god knows what that left us all a little scared when he went into one of his ""states.""  Nobody knew whether to just leave him alone or to let him go crazy on them, so eventually we learned to just give him space.  We never knew what he did with that space and we honestly never wanted to know.  We just know a few days later he would be back to being his wild, crazy self with a cocky smile tucked under his reckless eyes.

She looked up and said, ""i'm hungry for more than food"" as she bit her lip meticulously.  instead of getting up to supplement her tiny salad with no dressing she simply downed a bottle of water and played with her long, thin fingers.  I asked her, ""do u want some of my chicken?  its boiled, so its not bad for you"" and she looked at it really longingly before she replied, ""no, i had a big breakfast and am going out to dinner.""  When we had cake in the office I saw her take secret peaks at it when she was alone in the staff room and one time I swear I saw her smell it, look around quickly, and then walk hurridly away smacking on her bottom lip.  She wasn't too thin, so I never really worried.  In fact, she was pretty average.  Once I saw her stand up and fall back down one day.  I gave her some of my lunch and she chewed it methodically moving a white paper napkin to her lips and coughing lightly every once in a while.  I never even bothered to check the napkin.  I shuddered, and the next day she brought me a rediculously overthough out lunch to make up for my kindness.  It was obvious she had spend a lot of time making it and thinking what I liked, and I wondered, ""why doesn't she do the same for herself?""

""Daddy didn't give affection and the boy was something mommy wouldn't wear""
""And all of those I love you's were accompanied by tears""
""I know the awful things you say and who you say them to""
""one mark for each day since you've been away""
""tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon""

His hands were shaking, terribly bad.  ""I won't do this, not this time.  I won't do this, I don't need this.""  He kept telling himself he was strong, but inside he felt weak.  What did the world want from him?  He had kept strong for so long...too long.  He felt all alone.  He didn't deserve anybody around, he didn't need anybody.  He was strong, he was his own strenght.  But he was lonely, even when people where all around him smiling and laughing with him.  It wasn't enough.  He read through all the words and escaped into his mind too frequently.  His mind couldn't hold him right now, nothing could.  He didn't want to go back, he didn't want to repeat the cycle.  The screaming in his head was getting louder.  ""No!"" he shouted, but as he looked down at his hand he knew what he had already done.  He had killed something without thinking.  No, he had killed something because he had thought too much...way too much.  He couldn't stop thinking, and that thinking was killing himself.  ""shit"" he said, but then he got up and walked into his room, closed the door, turned off the lights, and felt relief.  the cycle had begun.

and she sat and looked out at all the people of the world and wondered where the fairness was and why she was blessed.  she smiled for herself and managed a weak smile for those around her, because even though she couldn't always see them smile, she hoped that her smile could hold them up for a while.  she didn't understand the world, but she tried to live within its boundaries and always see the positive side inside her heart.  but she saw them all suffering and felt bad, but realized, sometimes, all she could do was smile and offer a helping hand."

"event","a lonely boy looked down a dark street, wondering when the feeling would subside. after walking a few blocks, he sighed and realized it was to no avail. he climbed the stairs up to his room and lay with his back on the bed staring up at the ceiling. nothing. he got up, restless, and walked downstairs and outside still searching for something in the moonlight. it was too quiet. only his heavy breaths could be heard in the still night where even a cricket was not chirping. the water called to him, invited him in. he took the bait leaving behind the dark still night for the dark blue waves of eternity. i forget his name.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

my physical appearance this summer: tan, brown longish hair that is usually straight in a ponytail and sometimes worn wavy with a natural sun streaks in it, tshirt and shorts with teva flip flops, sports watch, greenish eyes that stare out, a real necklace and an elastic one that makes ppl ask me if i am a beach girl, athletic build with muscular legs, light pink nails, diamond studded earrings, spurs bracelet

what doing:  usually my nose is in a book or i am staring off, daydreaming, taking long walks alone or with my dog, watering the flowers, running 30 minutes a day, swimming for fun, sometimes if i am lucky waterskiing, biking through small neighborhoods that all look the same and remind me that there is more to life than work, studying for my mcat, eating pie/icecream in bed, eating oatmeal on the patio under a huge umbrella for breakfast while watching children in the pool, driving the boat and feeling as if i could steer it into the sky

often times, i am all alone, living in practically total solitude aside from my little runt dog.  my mom or my dad are also with me a lot, but not the three of us because we recognize 3 is a bad number.  i worry that i do not know how to communicate with ppl and will freak out when forced to next school year.

i worry that i will never make the mile time our new coach has outlined of us.  i am not a runner, and especially not a sprinter.  i am trying though to follow her workout plan and that makes me feel good.

i long for that feeling in a book where you know that it is just perfect, that even though the character is upset or whatnot, the author got that sense of emotion that you sometimes feel and put it into words exactly.  or when you are finished reading and just close the book and continue thinking about it.

i listen to music.  i listen now to country music sometimes when i am driving through the hill country and on back country roads wearing my bright pink sunglasses and driving my SUV.  i feel special and laugh at myself.  nobody else can see me as i belt out the words windows down.  i am all alone and that is promising and fulfilling.  the trees are shrubs to notherners and the hills are lumps to westerners, but to me they are beautiful.  they are all i ever want and all i will ever need.  and then when i switch my music to a different station and hear u2 playing i get that feeling down my spine or when the announcer says that all he is asking is for a little respect, i chuckle.

i am living in a dream world and all dreamers must one day awake.  sometimes the scenary changes and sometimes evil thoughts pervade the unconcious.  sometimes it is lonely when u sleep alone every night, but it is calm and sleep is relaxing and revitalizing.  waking up is going to be hard.

i have dialogue with some people via the computer or the phone.  in my head i tell some of my old friends what i am thinking and have little conversations with them.  i wonder if we will ever be friends again.  i have people sometimes come visit me and i show them around and it makes me happy.  i root for the spurs and bite my lip too hard when they are not doing well and then remember, no matter how much my stomach hurts when they play, my nervousness will not help them.  i long for the after championship party at academy, but realize it will not be the same because my best friend is out of town and we are separated by so much more than milage.  but then, i am separated from everybody by so much more than milage.

sometimes i think i am special.  then i feel guilty for thinking that thought.  when i feel as if maybe i am smart i do something really dumb.  when i feel as if i am trusting a book is published that makes me not want to be trusting.  when i feel as if i am religious i remember everything i do not believe in.  but mostly, when i think that maybe i am able to see things differently for whatever reason, i begin to feel egocentric and then think that maybe i am overly flawed.  then i think to myself, i am not special and have no reason to feel that way.  then i take a walk or jump in a pool and smile.

my eyes often look distant and glazed.  i wonder if people notice.  my smile reflects a different understanding.  i know nobody notices.

""we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl""

i long for deeper meaning and quest to find it either inside or out.  we all do.  that's our purpose, we all have our paths."

"event","I am having uncertain feelings; uncertain of what my mood is and what it should be.  Hurt, betrayed, comfounded, apathetic, awed, contented?  Very different emotions, all very feasible reactions.  There are several possibilities, several options that I see as viable.  One, talking to the person who spurred them.  Two, never talking to that person again.  Three, never acting to that person as if anything happened.  Four, combine one of 1-3 with talking to a friend.  Five, combine number 3 with acting to everybody else as if nothing happened.  Six, and extreme, stop talking to people altogether.  Now talking could encompass a lot.  It could be a rant, it could be a rational conversation, it could be me being sarcastically biting.

What does a memory do?  Sometimes it reopens old wounds.  Sometimes it seals the past for good.  Sometimes, irrational things happen and can't be explained.  Sometimes, things need to be relived, other times they don't.  I hope good judgement was made.  That crazy person who runs around wild in the middle of the night does not need to be reinstated into craziness.  Especially, when solitary.  Especially when lied to.  Especially when deceived.

I am staring at the TV blankly, as if waiting for Sienfeld to describle my emotions and fill in my empty thoughts.  I am hoping that a joke will pop out of the screen and encompass my mind.
My two sides seem to be arguing with themselves, telling themselves that each is right and the other wrong, respectively.  There are no deal brakers, no peace makers, no best buddies standing around.  Two sides, the irony.
I guess I am angry a little bit, I can admit to that.  I was flattered a little bit too.  Amused other times.  Fearful still at others.  I guess it makes it good, I guess it makes it real.
Lying awake unable to sleep.  Thanks.  I'm sure EVERY scenario was fully thought through.  Except, what are YOU doing when 4 a.m. rolls around?  What about sleeping?  A sardonic smile lingers on my face.  Oh, the irony.

You made me cry.  I said I trusted you.  You made me cry.

I guess all I want is a reach out, from the ""perpetrator.""  I am not asking for an apology, I do not merit that nor does it seem appropriate for perhaps there is nothing to apologize for.  I am just asking for that friendship that supposedly was/is so strong.  I guess I am asking for some hope.  I guess I am seeing that girl sitting alone in the corner and I am asking how she got there, asking what's being done for her now.  Silence.  Yeah, that's what I fucking though.  How it reverberates through the room.  Silence, speaking louder than any word that could escape a mouth, a finger, or a page.  Irony.  Silence.  Ironically silent."

"event","<P>I have been thinking a lot lately...i've been keeping a running dialogue/journal in my head.&nbsp; I guess I have had a lot of time to think and a lot of time to write it down, but I haven't recorded it, b/c honestly, my best thoughts are my private ones.&nbsp; That sounds pompous.&nbsp; This is gonna be in a LJ cut b/c its going to be a long diatribe and probably will just be a ramble with no conclusion.&nbsp; In my mind there are many of these on a variety of topics and they will probably pop up here and there.&nbsp; So again, yes, I am probably pompous, but here lays my opinion very very much shortened b/c i don't want to type even more useless babble than i already am going to.&nbsp; So yeah, that's my preface.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Diatribe on weight""><BR>today i heard something which made me rediculously sad for america and angry at ourselves for letting this happen.&nbsp; a little girl, no older than 12, was playing with her younger brother in a pool.&nbsp; i was upstairs reading, paying slight attention to the kids and their mom playing when i perked my ears at the girl saying, ""mom, if i weighed less would you get me"" so and so.&nbsp; I didn't hear the mother's response, but the fact that this girl who was simply a little pudgy would think that she could attain anything for being skinnier is just disgusting.&nbsp; she then went on to say in her texas accent, ""i'm gonna lose 30 pounds this summer...i'm really gonna do it...i can do it, i'm gonna, just watch me.""&nbsp; this just about broke me.&nbsp; i wanted to go down there and be like, ""hey, tell ur child that she's beautiful and doesn't need to change anything.&nbsp; tell ur little girl that she's ur little girl and u love her and her weight does not matter.""&nbsp; but then, in my head, i remembered thinking the exact same thing and going through with it.&nbsp; perhaps that is why i was so fired up about the comments, b/c i too had/have felt that way.&nbsp; the lingering thought that ""well, if i weigh less i can do more.""&nbsp; so why did this 10 year old and i who have such different insights and outlooks on life get this crazy idea?&nbsp; one answer, society.&nbsp; and as i am a member of society, i am just as at fault as everybody else and so while i am directing my rampage at society, realize, i am including the direction at myself.</P>
<P><BR>so, what is society doing?&nbsp; they throw out horrible crappy food and make it commonplace while expecting middle america to maintain the standards of a body that people had when they did physical labor and had a significantly lower caloric intake.&nbsp; in the past, a size 10 was considered the most desirable waist size, even further back than that being overweight was a sign that you had money to eat so was looked upon highly.&nbsp; now, i am not saying being overweight is good as it lends to numerous health problems, but come on guys, a size 10 people say is overweight.&nbsp; let's be real.&nbsp; i know more people who wear a size 10+ than people who wear 4-.&nbsp; And yet, today, the ideal body is a size 2, maybe 4, maybe 1.&nbsp; The hollywood actresses can pull it off, but if you examine what they looked like at their opening roles they were all pudgier, all a little heavier.&nbsp; Yes, you can lose weight when u have a personal trainer on call at all times and the money to buy expensive food and a chef to make it for you.&nbsp; But what about the average joe?</P>
<P>and that's where money also plays a role.&nbsp; the athletes who can afford training probably won't be overweight.&nbsp; the moms who wear their spandex and have streaky blonde highlites and belong to social clubs can go to their aerobics classes as their kids are turning to drugs and cutting classes, but it's okay, b/c they look good for society.&nbsp; the college/high school kids whose mommy and daddy pay for a gym membership and they go and wipe their gleaming bodies with crisp white towels who appear before them like magic, never asking how they were cleaned or where the money came from.&nbsp; oh, and lets not forget the dads who go out for some raquetball while their wives play tennis and their kids are ""swimming"" in the pool talking about how much they hate their parents.&nbsp; yeah, money, society's own god b/c its something 99% of the population can agree upon which is much less controversial that the gods of religion.</P>
<P>some people have a good metabolism, some people don't.&nbsp; that's part of life.&nbsp; indulgance is not the problem that we think it is.&nbsp; we blame people who are overweight for being overweight.&nbsp; we blame them like it is a weakness.&nbsp; psychologists tell us that people who are obsese face almost as much discrimination as people who black/hispanic/whatever minority is being mistreated while they face more discrimination than the handicapped.&nbsp; society sets them into a trap, makes them fat and then blames them for it.</P>
<P>in the end, it's not fair.&nbsp; some people can buy their way in, some people are naturally there, some have given up, and some people spend their lives trying to get ""in.""&nbsp; those that are in the latter category i feel sorry for.&nbsp; over 70% of americans have dieted, failed, and tried again.&nbsp; now continue that cycle for ur entire life or for at least 25 years (age 20 - 45) and u have a lot of irritation at oneself and at dieting.&nbsp; there are fad crash diets out there that might make u drop 5 pounds fast, but then, leave u without much.&nbsp; and what's worse is that most diets work for a while but as soon as u venture out even just a little, blam, ur back weighing more than u did before u started.&nbsp; and then there's the group that is ""diseased:"" the eating distorder crowd.&nbsp; people actually starve themselves or throw up what they have eaten so as to try to fit the mold.&nbsp; often times, this is noticed by friends and family but not stopped.&nbsp; thus, the friends and family are just as equally to blame as society.&nbsp; maybe people do it because they haven't heard enough ""i love you's"" or gotten enough hugs in their lives, but something clicks which makes people endorse these diseases which allow their bodies to degenerate.&nbsp; and then, these people are seen as even more of a hoax and a problem.&nbsp; it becomes another horribly vicious cycle.</P>
<P>so where does this leave us?&nbsp; what do we do about it?&nbsp; i honestly do not know.&nbsp; trapped in a society where people are judged by their waistlines and people gain their own self image based on horribly high (or low, ironically) standards we have little room to move.&nbsp; there is no obvious solution and i give u none.</P>
<P>so where does this leave me?&nbsp; where does this leave that 10 year old girl.&nbsp; she will probably go through middle school and high school being teased and feel depressed at some point, maybe multiple points, because she isn't popular or isn't the prettiest girl in her grade.&nbsp; in such a small town as marble falls, the fat and chubby kids are ostracized and rebuked.&nbsp; she will probably fall into dieting and she will probably fail.&nbsp; the statistics are against her.&nbsp; in fact, she will probably gain more weight as she gets older.&nbsp; the statitics will one day kill her.&nbsp; and me?&nbsp; i don't know.&nbsp; it leaves me sad and angry.&nbsp; it leaves me mad that i have fallen victim to a society i have helped to create.&nbsp; it leaves me a little hungry and a little irritated that damn blue bell icecream is full of empty calories, but then i remember, i need dairy so maybe i can have some.&nbsp; but it leaves me with the idea of moderation and an attidue of ""fuck you bitch"" for making me feel inferior.&nbsp; because i remember times when i was underweight based on doctor charts and feeling fat because i was not a size zero.&nbsp; so here's a big fuck you b/c that's the only thing that i can do/say.&nbsp; is it immature?&nbsp; hell yes, but as i sit here eating a small bowl of blue bell icecream and feeling sore from an aerobics work out at a gym that my dad paid for, that attitude lets me smile.</P>
<P><BR></lj-cut></P>
<P>i apologize for being cynical, for being terse, for being derogatory.&nbsp; cynism and apathy/over concern (i love opposites as i often sway b/w the two) and extremes are in my nature.&nbsp; for this, i too am sorry.&nbsp; it's just, it's so awesome of a world and we really mess it up for ourselves so often that its sad.&nbsp; we're all learning, we're all swimming our own little paths.<BR></P>"

"event","Its not that I don't like talking about who I am, it's that I feel as if it doesn't matter to people.  It's not that I want to be secretive so much as I don't want to burden people with what I am thinking.  I don't want to whine about things that are trivial because I get upset that other people use things as a cop out or an excuse.  I am my only excuse, just me.  But, regardless, I have been talking lately a lot more than normal, mostly because people have been asking.  And its nice and its not nice all at once.

Last night I had a dream that I was at my grandmothers funeral and I didn't cry there.  I didn't cry because nobody knew she was my grandmother.  And when people looked at me and asked why I was there I didn't talk, I just sat there, biting my lip.  If I had opened my mouth all of my emotions would have poured over and then it would have just been one big mess.  My cousin had them play a happy song, she would have liked that.  Maybe I was at her funeral because I missed her real funeral.  Maybe I was there because I was thinking of her yesterday.  Regardless, she was there, looking up at me, with her blazing eyes glazed over.  And it was tragically sad.  I awoke very groggy and out of it uncertain of where the line was between reality and the dream world.  I don't like nights like that because it's hard to recover from my own imagination.

Death scares me, it scares me a lot.  I don't like thinking of it because I don't understand it and I don't like things that I can't understand.  I can't just accept it, but inevitable because it is something I don't want to think about I think about it a lot.  I remember sitting at Yale outside of the bookstore and talking about death for an hour and feeling totally overwhelmed.  What caused that memory to just reenter my mind?  I don't know.  I miss those real conversations a lot and I realize that perhaps I have outgrown that time in my life where I am supposed to be searching for the answers.  I am not a teenager really anymore, but an adult.  I am supposed to be trecking ahead into the future, not living in a dream world in my mind.  My idealism is my crutch and my nemisis at different times.

My friend told me she is only happy when she is thinking about who she used to be.  I did not respond because there really was no response necessary.  It's dismal to be afraid of the future but even more dismal to just not care about it either way.  I feel as if apathy is more hampering than almost any other emotion because to totally deprive oneself of feeling is very oddly emotionally draining.  Its like your body/soul/mind (i dunno which) totally giving up or giving in.  And it sucks because there is no quick bounce back.  It sinks into you and totally transforms everything you do, engulfing your entire being in a pool of quick sand and pulls you under.  And apathy is when you stop fighting and just give in and lose your breath.  It's the moment that the water fills your lungs when you are drowning and you flutter between conciousness and unconcious oblivion.  It's not scary because the apathetic have no fear and it's not really sad because honestly, when ur apathetic, being sad is too much of an emotion to feel.  It just is, and just being is hard.

What's really bad though is watching a friend slip through the cracks and being unable to do anything about it.  While depression is a very harmful disease, depression is not an excuse.  I want to have sympathy and empathy, but it's hard to say you care to somebody who constantly rejects your compassion and your help.  I want to say I care more about the fact that you feel like shit more than the fact that you are unable to function as a normal human being, but I ask myself, what's the point.  The apathetic hear no words but only run from feelings of emotional disturbances.  The depressed just let the words jar them further into depression and further away from the ones who care.  But I ask, would a good boyfriend or a good friend continue or encourage one to keep not seeking help?  Perhaps it is my idealism, but I feel as if the answer is a strong and definate no.  A good friend does not wait for one to fail, does not sit back and watch one screw up the rest of their lives, but a good friend is the one who takes the blame for being a bitch and says something.  A good friend has to seem like a bad friend for a while and face the repurcussions of hatred or disgust.  So now I ask, who is going to step up and be a good friend?  Who will risk the friendship to help the friend in need?  So far, there have been no takers.  Tomorrow could be a different day.  Hopefully."

Jack took me to a Pirates game where we sat less than 10 rows up straight behind homebase.  It was the homeplate rotunda area where they wait on you and there is a buffet and all that jazz.  After the game there were fireworks that were gorgeous b/c, heck, I just love fireworks and the stadium is at the perfect location for them because they are shot from the river and light up the Pittsburgh skyline.  The night was amazing.

I am not the person I was even last year.  That being said, I don't want to know all of my faults from last year.  It's not that I feel judged, its that I feel as if looking back isn't always the best thing in the world.  Why can't we leave the past behind us?  I don't want to get angry for choices I made because there is enough now to fill my focus.  Be cool, maintain."

"event","I've noticed today that there are tear stains all over my bed.  The dark purple sheets don't lie.  They are all over where my head would roll.  Not concentrated in one place, but on the left and right and even a few in the center where the back of my head usually lies as I go to sleep.  This makes me think that it's from several nights.  I change my sheets like once a month.  I guess it means my nights have been more tumultuous than I thought.  I don't like that, I don't like that at all.

I wish sometimes that I could be as honest as a certain person.  I wish that I felt comfortable sharing my thoughts and my life stories.  Yes, stories because there is not one continuum.  When I was talking to somebody yesterday at a party I wanted to cry out, ""yes, i understand.  yes, you saw me there, i just never said anything.""  But similarly to the time in my head, I didn't say anything.

I've started weighing myself every day again.  I have lost almost 5 pounds this past week.  I have been exercising a lot and constantly doing something due to Carnival and it being amazing outside.  I haven't really been hungry.  I say I'm hungry cause I know I should be and I make an effort to eat one meal a day, but only because I know I have to.  My calves have started cramping again when I am sitting in my bed.  The same pain that woke me up every morning at 6 am this summer has begun, but in a very mild manner.  It's not like the sharp knives shooting signals up my legs, but rather a dull constant reminder.  When I feel that pain, I know I need to eat something, so I do.

As she said that she was uncertain about love and everything, that she didn't see a purpose to living, that she felt as if it was all a lie and didn't know why she was alive, my heart jumped a little.  I wanted to hug her and look her straight in the eyes and say ""there is none.""  I wanted to tell her that it's all a bunch of crap and the only way I think that we really can be happy is to lie to ourselves.  That's what I think most people have to do on so many levels- social, religious, everything.  And those people probably don't realize how much of a delusional world they are living in.  Because honestly, as soon as you realize it, you are crazy and depressed.  Jaded.  I see the world and I have to smile a little because I know that I'm living a lie.  We delve down deep into the trenches.  I am not okay with it, and I know that.  It's what causes me the problems perhaps.  It's what makes me wierd and moody and hard to get along with and a little empty.  I don't know why or where this is going.  I guess that's the problem, there are too many unanswered questions.  But getting back to why I didn't say there is none and hug her is because I felt as if that was wrong.  I want there to be a point.  I want to believe there is something more and it not to be a lie.  Maybe everybody who is ""delusional"" is actually right and I am just crazy because I am lost and have not found that happy place.  It is all very confusing.  I shouldn't speculate because nothing I say is true for certain, and I shouldn't tell somebody ""there is none"" when I feel as if I could be mistaken.

I am overall at a very good place.  I am playing soccer on a regular basis, I am doing my schoolwork, and I am involved in my sorority.  I have a boyfriend who is very good to me and friends and roommates that I don't ever want to lose touch.  I am immersed in the CMU community and am making good bonds with my teachers.  I know how to have fun and how to be serious.

And yet, as she pointed out, it will all disappear.  In five years I will be in medical school frusterated with the process of becoming a doctor.  In ten years I will be a doctor, probably unmarried and alone, full of all the burdens.  In 100 years I will be dead.  Everybody and everything that I touched will be gone.  I won't even be a memory.  So what's the point?  I invite any answers, because as per usual, I have none.  I just have a lot of questions which I can't answer."

"event","So lately with everybody I have been wondering...Are we whatever we are b/c we like each other, or is it that we have found no reason not to like each other?

i expect very little.  i am a blank face.  i am bitingly sarcastic.  i am giddy with laughter when i feel uncomfortable or when i feel very self assured.  i am my own wall.  i retreat and hope that somebody beckons me out of my hole yet i lash out at them for trying.  i am a bitch, but only when i actually care.  i am not a good girlfriend or a good friend.  i don't try to be.  i don't want to be.  i just want to be honest.  i expect very little.  i am constantly reconstructing.  i am rearranging my living space inside my head.  i mean nothing when i say everything and mean everything when i say nothing.  i tell the truth through my eyes.  i smile when i am hurt.  i expect nothing because i know that nothing cannot be hurt.  i value friendship more than anything else in the world.  i want to be a friend as much as i want to have a friend.  i want somebody to know what makes me tick.  i don't let anybody know that i even turn.  i am everybody and nobody all at once.  this means nothing.

My mood depends on the weather.  I love being outside.  I love being active.  I think it's classical conditioning.  I think it's how I was raised.  I am positive I wasn't born like this.  I want to have control over my own destiny, or at least to think that my genes don't decide everything.  Fate verse free will.  Both in extremes are very scary.

Human rights...what the hell are those anymore?  Why do we otherize?  Why is it an us/them?  Why do I feel as if the only people that share or at least understand my beliefs are from home?  I don't let people finish when they explain their political views because I get so excited.  My head fills will a million things to say and I want to spout them all out so that I don't forget any of them.  I want them to spout out a million gazillion rebuttals back at me and me to respond to the big picture and the individual points.  I miss the debates...not like the formal ones in rounds with suits, but the banter.  The devil's advocate, the talking, and the shaping.  No, my opinions are not totally made and they change.  I always forget that here, nobody will change or concede a point because they see it as a loss.  In FA101, it was alright to say, ""ur right"" or ""i agree, but here's where I go differently.""  People here were not taught to think like that.  I miss debaters and their logic.  I miss people understanding the crazy things I come up with.  I guess, the thing is, I know I don't know anything yet.  I know what it is like to totally change one's dogma.  Most people who did not have the 4 year debate experience I did growing up in a very conservative environment, have not been taught to challenge and question their own beliefs.  I am not saying they don't think, because god knows most of my friends here think too much, I am just saying they have never believed the other side.  OMG, i just did it.  SIDES!  haha, there are no sides.  This is what I am coming to believe.  There are not two lines, one black, one white. but rather different shades of gray (Live song, awesome).  But regardless, I am sorry if I interrupt you or seem to be blowing you off, it's just, I want to go a million miles at a time...i respect your opinion even if it is different than my own and hope that you can at least listen when other ppl have different opinions, b/c that's what everything is, an opinion.

I guess I don't believe anything is fact.  Everything is an opinion to me.  There is no right or wrong on ANYTHING.  It's a very wierd way to look at the world, but it's how I see it.  I am very abstract.  I honestly believe that this bed that I am lying in is an opinion.  I accept it as fact to simplify my life, but in all honesty, I call it a bed while it could be considered 5 beds.  Thus, it is not absolute or concrete, but something which can change.  Something which is subject to point of view.  And to me, that's an opinion.  I don't think anybody will see that as valid, cause its the worse example ever, but the one that I like most is really long and just as dumb.  Whatever, it's just crazy talk that I probably don't really believe anyways.

Where did my beliefs come from?  Religious views.  Morals.  Parents.  Friends.  Actions.  Media.  Debate Coaches.  Hours of phone conversations.  Books.  Fear.  Love.  Hate.  Self.

And I layed there I realized, he wasn't over her.  Just as I wasn't over him.  And that's okay, b/c maybe you never really get over them.  Maybe you're not supposed to.  Maybe it's better that we're all a little jaded, a little experienced.  Hold onto your heart because you've only got one, they told me.  I'm holding on for dear life, my friend.  Well, my buddy, don't lose what you got because you were afraid to lose yourself.  I shall never be her.  He shall never be him.  And thank goodness.  It's fresh.

So when we ask if its safe he says nothing and walks away.&nbsp; EXCELLENT.&nbsp; So we have three girls carrying three bottles of alcohol walking around a sketchy area of Toronto by the railroad tracks in search of a meat packing plant.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; The tracks curve and we see a policeman and ask for directions.&nbsp; So, turns out this guy is a real jerk and says (cause we are all, including him, standing on the tracks) ""watch out for the train.""&nbsp; Hey buddy, don't tell me to watch out for the freakin train...you better watch out for my freakin hand which is going to punch you!&nbsp; Okay, so find the real policeman and he gives us directions, waits for us to walk off for about 3 minutes then drives up next to us and goes, ""wanna ride?""&nbsp; Screw that its sketchy, we're cold and all pile into the back of the policecar alcohol and all.&nbsp; He gets us there and we are angry, tired, and cold.&nbsp; To make a long story shorter, I finally get my car out of Cananda's towtrucks of doom for a mere sum of 200 dollars...the price of the hotel rooms.&nbsp; Excellent.<BR>Go home, drink everything we bought by the jacuzzi, talk girl talk on the beds, Lauren passes out asleep.&nbsp; Tiffany and I are sober.&nbsp; Aimee and her sister arrive.&nbsp; Drama ensues.&nbsp; I got caught in the middle.&nbsp; Lauren's still asleep through the entire 4 hours of the fighting and crying and screaming and throwing of crap.&nbsp; Aimee leaves and I feel bad.&nbsp; Tiffany stays and I am glad at that.&nbsp; Neither are mad at me, just at each other.&nbsp; I feel responsible because they are both my friends.&nbsp; I hate having to pick sides between friends.&nbsp; Lauren wakes up confused.&nbsp; I sleep four hours, get up, get ready, check out.&nbsp; Get the HECK out of Canada!&nbsp; Went to Rochester.&nbsp; Saw Andy in his environment which made me feel happy.&nbsp; It was neat and rural.&nbsp; Drove home.&nbsp; Lots of driving of the Pathfinder, but it was alright.&nbsp; Got home at midnightish and went over to Jacks.</P>

<P><BR>I have noticed how different I am.&nbsp; I am lethargic.&nbsp; I am not fully into anything.&nbsp; I don't toss my whole self or soul in.&nbsp; I am reserved.&nbsp; We talked in the car about being jaded at the age of 20, having already given up.&nbsp; Why is this the way all of my friends here feel?&nbsp; Why do we all feel lost already (at least a little).&nbsp; (I like sitcoms.&nbsp; 30 minutes of laughter, an end hug, and that's it with a happy go lucky end feeling.&nbsp; El fin.&nbsp; And its all good.)</P>
<P>I was 15 when I told my best friend that missing somebody was silly.&nbsp; That I would not ever miss anybody again.&nbsp; I do miss people, but I have never told somebody that I miss that I missed them.&nbsp; I can't do that.&nbsp; I hope he understood when he said that he missed me that I was silent not because I didn't miss him, but because I can't say that.&nbsp; I will never say that, and I am not sorry for that.&nbsp; He asked why I felt uncomfortable around him so often when he said certain things...""its not your fault I say...it's not your fault, its my own.""&nbsp; He says he knows and that's what he needs to do, is cater to me.&nbsp; I say ""don't you wonder why"" and he says ""yes, but I am waiting for you to tell me"" so i blurp out some nonsence and then fall silent and dig my head into a pillow.&nbsp; I want to be closer because I feel so comfortable, but I can't.&nbsp; This is my fault and I can't shake it.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.</P>
<P>Midsemester grades SUCK.&nbsp; SUCK.&nbsp; SUCK.&nbsp; I want to not think about it but I need to.&nbsp; If I could do it all over again, I'd still be at CMU, I'd still be in Catman, and I'd still be making most of the same decisions.&nbsp; The little things might change, but the overall would remain stationary.&nbsp; I like it here at Carnegie Mellon and I think it's because I chose to come here instead of just being dropped here by mistake.&nbsp; I can do better, I have just messed up on three tests total.&nbsp; Three tests in three classes.&nbsp; Dropped my A to a B plus and gave me a B in a class I need an A in.&nbsp; I can do better, even though I did work for those three tests, I can work wiser.&nbsp; I still have the weekend and I am looking forward to it.&nbsp; I think I am trying to be optimistic instead of just idealistic.&nbsp; Oh well, if all else, I will enjoy the cleanliness of the apartment.&nbsp; Umm umm ummm...</P>"

Tomorrow, Canada or bust.  I might bust due to inappropriate identification.  Wish me luck...

But honestly, really excited to go with Lauren, Aimee, and Tiffany.  Fun group of girls and I need outta here.

"event","I talked a lot, especially when I had nothing to say so that they would not see me.  I was afraid for them to look at me and have any reason to question who I was and where I was going.  My words filled the empty spaces so as to avoid the questioning glances.  Their gazes were meant to be as absent as mine.  My voice lifted off into the air, taking on a meaning all its own.  And, I could tell they were spellbound, clinging to every word that left my lips and hopefully awaiting the next sentence that would drift out quickly.  All the while, I was laughing and leaning in so as to attract their attention.

Secretly, however, my mind was not on the story, not on the punchline, not on the conversation at all.  Though, it was on them, it was on all of them.  My mind was racing one thousand and twenty circles across the room eyeing what might be seen as off and coming up with one thousand and twenty one quick fix solutions to the problem.  While my melodic voice was carrying the tempo, my scrupulous mind was playing its own tricks.  But as my eyes gazed into each one of their faces, I started to realize, they too were only on the brink of the conversation.  Though we were all totally enthralled with each other and the easy breezes of the room, there was something a little deeper that seemed to be absent.  What was missing?  Where did it go and why had I only just noticed?  Perhaps it was because I was too afraid for them to take note of me that I had failed to really take note of them.

But the secret was out, not for everybody, but for me.  And as I looked questioningly into their eyes I realized something even more horrifying- it wasn't that they were missing what I was covering up, it was simple that they never had it to begin with.  To be absent something which I held so dear was unbelievable and unthinkable to me, drawing be aback for a momentary hesitation in my own speech that they looked at me in disbelief as I did them.  But there shock was on a stutter in conversation while mine was on a stutter in their person.  Something so great a difference, but we sat there for those few seconds with the same spellbound looks, eyes squinted, heads cocked, and a small smile growing on our faces.  And then, very quickly, we all erupted in a fit of laughter.  I don't think anybody who was there could say why or what for, but laughter resounded about the table.  We laughed till we had no laugh to give and then sat, looking merrily exhausted, our bodies heaving up and down trying to catch our breaths.

Looking back I can recall not a word said across the table of friends and aquaintances, but I can remember the tempo.  The high upbeat, fast moving pace that we were going at.  I can remember their gazes resting upon me as I guided the conversation in and out, picking up steam in certain areas only to go even faster and take a sharp bend.  My voice picked up and went down in rhythm, trying to disguise the ultra high pitch murmer I have a tendancy to produce.  And all their eyes, resting upon my lips and me saying everything a little too quickly and a little too much.  But that everything, all those thousands of everythings, well, it was nothing, and I knew it.  And, somehow, I think they knew it too."

i'm dreaming of things i never knew, but ur not in it like u were supposed to be.  (i believe in angels, something good in everything i see.)  i wonder where u are and what ur doing.  i see you sometimes.  i wonder if u see me.  we don't actually ever see each other.

the snow today was gorgeous...the trees holding onto it as though afraid to be bare and exposed...the bikes were covered all in their neat little rows, but totally unusable.

i'm smiling.  there's no reason.  i have a lot of work.  but i'm smiling.  and that's okay.

i'm not good at talking about you...i overexaggerate the little stuff and underexaggerate the big stuff...maybe that's to protect me...maybe its to protect you.

and i whisper it will all be okay my friend.  maybe not today, but eventually.  it won't be perfect, but we'll get through it.  we have to, right?  if not, we'll just die and that's no fun.

i wonder if u know that ur always with me.  u never have left me for one day, not even for one second.  i have no need for u in my life.  i thank god ur away from me, but i thank him u were beside me.  i am strong because of u.  i am a better person because ur not here.  my speech, my nervous habits, and my subtlties all reflect u.  all reflect us.  u scarred me, both good and bad.  they'll never know, they'll never understand.  and that's okay, that's okay.

i wonder if i'm ready for this.  i wonder if i'll ever be ready for this.  the real world is diffucult and i'm not even part of it yet.  i think i would prefer to remain in academia forever surrounded by a purple haze of knowledge.  i wish i was a philosophy major.  i miss that stuff.  i feel so uneducated at the things that really matter as a chem major.  a girls gotta make a living though.  teleology.  the ends justifies the means.  i hate debate (but not really).  i am glad i am free.

i've stopped pondering the important things b/c they drive me crazy as i will never find the answer.  i guess that's lazy, but it keeps me sane.

""sing with me, sing for the year,
sing for the laughter, sing for the tear;
sing with me, just for today,
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take u away..."""

(none of us can)</P>
<P>To be a 15 year old girl again full of hope and promise...still believing that I can be and do anything.&nbsp; Still feeling loved and wanted.&nbsp; (""don't look back in anger, i heard you say"")&nbsp; It's hard not to look back at all the memories that have made you who you are.&nbsp; And yeah, I am glad for every little thing that has happened in my life and I wouldn't trade a moment of it for anything because, well, nothing dramatic has ever really happened to me.&nbsp; But slowly I feel as if this world is getting to me, pulling the life out of me and leaving me drowning in a sea of helplessness.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what you do sometimes, you're going to fail.&nbsp; It doesn't matter how hard you work, sometimes you will just get passed up because somebody has a connection.</P>
<P>I am not sure what anything has to do with that.&nbsp; I am thinking in flashback memories.&nbsp; I remember standing outside against the stones in the early part of summer.&nbsp; I remember falling down onto the ground into the grass gasping and hitting hard.&nbsp; I remember eyes meeting mine and saying ""i promise this will be okay"" and me saying ""never promise, you always break them.""</P>
<P>I remember my chest burning.&nbsp; (And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings) I remember screaming loudly.&nbsp; I remember nobody believing me.&nbsp; I remember giving up.</P>
<P>I remember the first day I got to Pittsburgh.&nbsp; I remember crying a lot that night in my sleep or stealing moments here and there when my parents were out of the room to have a few tears fall down.&nbsp; I remember them walking away and leaving me in my room and me trying to cry, because it felt like I should be.&nbsp; And I remember actually starting to cry and not being able to stop because I didn't want to be here and felt so alone.</P>
<P>Do you remember the first time you knew that you were all by yourself...like, totally, completely alone?&nbsp; It's a hard realization.&nbsp; I learned that before coming to college, but there is something startling about the realization that nobody cares.&nbsp; That isn't to say that people don't care, but, I guess having the feeling that nobody cares.</P>
<P>And God, I want to be something special.</P>
<P>I know it's totally selfish, but I am not content just being blah.&nbsp; We used to talk about people having lists.&nbsp; I used to say that I didn't believe in them because it was a pool system of friendship.&nbsp; It's easy to not believe when you are on the top of your world.&nbsp; It's easy to be a skeptic when you aren't standing on firm ground.</P>
<P>She said ""tell me all your problems"" and I said ""i don't have any.""&nbsp; Maybe that's problem number one.&nbsp; Her voice...it was so calm, so, absent.&nbsp; Or...maybe that was me.</P>

<P>I remember sitting there...i'm always just freaking sitting there.&nbsp; I WANT TO SCREAM!&nbsp; i sit here in silence.</P>
<P>I have just one question for you: does the dust still dance in the light?&nbsp; mine doesn't.&nbsp; i hope yours still is magically doing the tango or something else exciting.</P>
<P>And tomorrow I will wake up, and this will be gone...but it's never really gone I guess...it's just hidden...buried.&nbsp; I feel like I have two lives...one real and one fake.&nbsp; This is fake.&nbsp; This is fake.&nbsp; This has to be fake.</P>"

"event","I feel as if now is the best time to write, as I am in a wierd state.  I didn't sleep last night but worked on a lab report.  I made it to all my classes today in a great mood.  Went to g-eagle at 3 am with Kristen and then we went to find the house on Beeler that she knew about.  Found it at, oh, about 4 am when it was definately snowing outside.  Had to call and ask Lauren the address and she started listing a www. address...very funny.  Okay, so somewhere in the middle of the night I shimmied a few times correctly which is something we all thought was an impossibility, we ate a lot of crap, and I downed about 5 servings of diet Mountain Dew.  I was a little jittery and, uh, very out of it.  I saw the sun rise out the dining room windows and watched the snow pick up and let down again only to pick itself back up.  We could have prevented this whole fiasco if we had worked ahead of time, if we had scheduled our lives to even a slight degree, or just worked effiently, but you know what, i am glad that we didn't.  It's wierd that sitting around the kitchen table with us each listening to music or talking on AIM while struggling that I feel super close to these girls and to everybody else that is going through the same thing.  I talked to one girl today in class cause she was needing help and afterwards we had a lot of laughs.  I never thought I would like her, but it turns out, she was funny.  A lot of us in a wierd sence came together either through needing help or whining about sleep deprivation, and for that, I am thankful.  Sometimes, its not about the work or getting it done, but how you get it done and the people that are there for you.  And I guess I can say that everytime I have a big test, I learn not only the material on the exam (hopefully), but something about myself and the people that I am studying with.  That sounds super corny, but I dunno, it seems true if only for the moment.

Walking home I saw this raven up in the tree.  Being winter, there were no leaves so his view was very clear.  It was singing, or beckoning, very loudly and there was something which drew my attention to it so that I was walking forward with my head facing behind me.  In a sence, this bird which I spent my entire freshmen year proclaiming ugly to crazy Coach Butler, was beautiful.  It had me totally mesmorized and enchanted.  It took off at one point in flight only to soar to another tree.  I think the reason it was so awe-inspiring to me was that I have never really seen a bird in a tree without leaves.  There is something very different here, something in the air.  It's stagnate as in winter, but things are starting to move.  Spring is coming, not yet, but moving in a little each day.

Loopy...I'll show you loopy. :)  I like the TAs and some of my teachers a lot.  I am writing this here so that when I get angry at them about a grade or something, I will remember to keep it in perspective.

So looking back at something I wrote once, I found something which stood out to me: ""She loved him not because she loved who he was, loved the things that he represented, or how he looked.  No, she loved him simply because he adored her.  He loved her with his whole heart, and for that, she was grateful enough to bestow her love upon him.  She did not really love him, but loved that he loved her, and that was enough for her to call whatever they had true love.""

Adios dear reader."

My work, my work, my work.  I shall not let you fall away from me.  I shall not let us fall apart cause that's what I am here for...not friendships, not guys, not soccer, but for schoolwork.

But I am paying for lectures, for labs, for instruction on schoolwork and on life which happens to come at me pretty fast too.

"event","Alright, I am feeling depressed so I guess it's the perfect time to write an entry.  I have made the last like 5 or so private, so hopefully I will feel comfortable publicizing this one.  Who knows now?  They always start as public, but then I get a little scared, a little worried of what somebody would say or think and change it.  Or I get a little self-concious or paranoid and immediately a public post becomes privatized.  I guess I should have more faith in other people or in myself, but I don't and I can't and I'm not going to pretend that things are different.

How do you explain to somebody that you didn't used to be like this?  How do you explain that if they peel away all the layers, all the neurotic habits, all the scared tendancies that they will find something very different?  The real question I suppose is will that something ever actually be shown and why isn't it shown already.  I don't think that the outside layer is very attractive, but the inner layer is equally repulsive.  It's the middle layers, the ones that are also for show, but that take a little bit to nudge into that are created perfectly for others.  They won't repel but they aren't totally fake, so they offer a curiosity which is more attractive than the raw truth or the raw falsities.  A mixture.  People like well roundedness.  Cut to the middle.

I am in love with words, with phrases, with strings.  How words are put together, how sentences are formed and how the letters trickle down off of somebody's tongue.  I love just talking.  I get to not just explore another person, but myself.  Sometimes I am amazed at what pops out of my own mouth, totally unprotected and not what I was expecting.  Sometimes a small little lie comes out, or the truth when I want to be lying and it takes me a second to recover and question my subconcious.  (in my head Garden State is repeating where she says 'I haven't even lied in 4 days' and he says 'really?' and she says 'no').  I don't like to lie, it makes me feel dirty.

El Mua Tez (10:46:40 PM): besides your smart, i'm sure you'll do well
I feel dumb right now.  Once, I was smart.  Once, I was real smart.  And now, now I'm not.  Where did I go?  Can somebody bring me back to me?  I doubt it.  I am just dumb now and that's okay.  Be happy with what ya got.

Don't get too close I say.  I jump out.  I have a high startle reflex.  Don't ask the questions you don't want to know the answers to.  It's all fun and games now.  I don't want it to go past being fun but I'm no fun so what does that mean?

STOP ASKING QUESTIONS.  start just accepting things or observing and formulating answers.  i can't help but ask everything, i always want to know.  i have an insaturable curiosity that can't be filled.

Stress is killing me.  I have a stress fracture.  I am going to do horrible this semester.  I am going to get out of shape since I can't run.  I am not going to ever talk to anybody or see anybody.  I am going to be a fatalist right now.  I am going to gain weight.  I am going to get over this and feel better, just not right this second, cause I need this out currently.  I am feeling extra ugly, extra dumb, and extra whiny.

"event","This is honestly not meant to be chewing out.  It is taken from a conversation I has this morning, but it only is spurred my thinking on a much more general level.

We at CMU are in such a mindset that we don't have time.  We are so push forward do work that when the weekend comes we are so push forward go party or go sit for a few hours and watch a movie only so that when Sunday morning rolls around (or before) we can push forward and do work nonstop for 5 more days.  We cut ourselves off emotionally from the people that we care about because something happens that takes up our time and our creativity.  We cut ourselves off from the people that we need and that need us, causing a small part of us to ache for something that we don't even know what it is.  And then, after a fuse busts and the whole machine is in parts, we are too busy to fix it.  Too busy working, too busy studying, too busy eating and sleeping.  But yet, we go to our respective houses/friends dorms/parties, we sit and watch mindless movies and tv, we sit and stare at the wall.  But it's to let the stress out of being so busy, so packed in, so short on time.  And all the while, we are thinking what work we should be doing, what we still have to do, and why we aren't doing it.  It creates a panic in us.  And still, no breakthroughs with our friend cause we are 'too busy'.  So we start saying to ourselves, ""he'll come to me"", or ""she's the one who needs to reach out"", but in all honesty, we just are waiting cause we are too busy to solve the problem.  And we justify our steadfast stillness with ""i still see almost everybody else"" and ""i still have lots of friends that i am semi-close to,"" but that one other close friend is wilting away and we don't do anything about it.  And honestly, this is sad.  This is pathetic that we prioritize every little bit of schoolwork above our personal lives sometimes, above the things that REALLY matter.  In the end, that one math problem set could have waited a few hours for a lunch with a pal, and that science quiz could have been dropped if it meant having a good conversation with a buddy...no, not the ones that you see everyday of your life.  Not the ones that u have decided ur not too busy to see because they when you see them, you don't really see them, because it's just part of the routine and so seeing them doesn't even make you lose your focus from your work.  Not those, but the real buddies that when you see, you get wrapped up in, a little lost, and afterwards, you have to sit for a while thinking of all that was said.  Yes, those friendships are often sacrificed if something small goes awry because we are so darn busy here at CMU planning for the rest of our lives that our current lives just float by us.  It is sad.

I hope that when I see my life floating past me, it at least waves hi and smiles, so that I know that what I am missing is worthwhile and good.  Then, maybe I won't feel so bad."

"event","So i'm sitting in bed currently as I have been for much of this past week.  I had what started out as a stomach ache on Saturday and progressed to a full blown flu.  I was ahead in all my classes, so I had all my problem sets and programs done over the weekend thank goodness.  I got my lab report done by working in shifts and got my ochem exam postponed thanks to my awesome prof.  I am feeling about 95% right now, but there were definately times when I just laid in bed forever (ie: i slept 20 hours out of a 26 hour period).  Enough of that though.  I am actually hungry again which is good considering I lost like 7 pounds this past week (oh no!) and hopefully I will start working out again next week.

There's a three day weekend which starts, ummm...now.  I actually don't get Monday off cause I have to make up my ochem exam then and I need to go into lab to make up for the days I missed this week.  But that's okay.  The Superbowl is this weekend and I have four different places that I could go to watch it, but I have no clue which I will go to.  I am going to go to Mike's house party tomorrow night and I am going to dinner and a movie tonight which will probably end in disaster, but these things happen.

So I just had this huge cleaning spree, cleaning everything in my apartment.  Everything.  In some way, I hope it is noticed because I didn't just do it because I am neurotic, but as a means of saying something.  Saying ""I know this has been a tough week for you"" and ""I hope everything is okay, and this is my small way of trying to help u out since I can't say anything to u about it.""  It's odd sometimes how people communicate without words and yet, it's amazing that we have the capacity to do that- a small gesture, a look, a token of appreciation, doing something for somebody else...yeah.  Sometimes words just are all wrong.

Last night, Mike made us turkey burgers.  My first solid food to eat in a week and it was amazing.  Just sitting around the table, the four of us, was a lot of fun.  We just sat there laughing.  It felt kind of family like and non-stressful.  It seriously, made me so happy.  Leave it to organic chemistry to bring people together.  :)"

"event","The fakeness permeates when she is speaking
It seeps out of her mouth
And fills the air
Stagnates for a while
And then dies in the heads of all she speaks to

It makes me want to scream
To rip out her tonsils
And throw them across the room

Five seconds ago she was glarring at me
Through clenched squinted eyes
So that every ounce of her anger
Could drain from her to me

15 seconds ago she proclaimed
""I hate you"" in a voice so nasty
That her voice was left resounding in my ears
But now, she's smiling happily
With a song and a melody in her talk
And it makes me question
The reality of the scene
She can't be both-
Why can't she choose?
Why can't any of us choose?"

"event","The split second of that scene in Tiffs room made me feel ill.  I thought I could throw up.  I even had to excuse myself and take a short walk around the hall and get water.  How will I ever be a doctor if I get so disturbed when somebody tries to kill themselves on a tv show?  Is it good that I am still so distressed about somebody taking a razor to their bodies while to many people it does not even make them flinch?  What does this say about desensitization of the American public?  What does it say about where we are going and does it honestly mean anything?  What does it say about me?  Just something for me to think about I suppose.

A lot of our past experiences make us who we are today.  A lot of memories are what make me smile, laugh, cry, hide, and pout.  Where would we be without them?  It seems as if I would be just a lost soul wandering around without a purpose if I didn't have my memories to hold me down.  I am being very questioning tonight.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY BESTEST!  Even though you won't read this, it's still nice to write it here."

"event","An excerpt from a short story I was playing around with:
But in reality I had no clue what strength my subconcious possessed.  I had no clue what was driving me....It was all a foggy haze...it was futile. Something had to be done. I couldn't just walk into my room...I couldn't just crawl back into bed and pretend that everything felt right...the reflection of the sink light going into my eyes blurred my emotions...My inner demons screamed at me as my logic tried to intervene on my behalf...I closed my eyes, I opened them, and still, I was standing alone barefoot on the cold tile with my scarred knees exposed in my shorts and my overweight stomach pertruding out. I felt ugly and defeated by something I didn't even know I was in battle with...""I have been here before, I will be here again, I will always be a little lonely and a little wierd."" But this was my ugliness, nobody elses. And a few seconds later, unmoved, I crawled into my sheets and somehow pulled the covers up high, set my alarm, and said my prayers."

"event","You know there is such a difference between being around somebody and actually being around somebody.  I went to eat today with a decent size group of people, hung out at SAE this weekend twice, and sat in NH with some folk yesterday.  If I had forseen these events from last year I would have predicted something very different.  I actually stayed and watched the football game with the soccer girls because they're so much fun and ""stood up"" the people I thought I had planned on watching with.  I saw Catie twice which like never happens, Ali twice, and Kori.  I never see them like ever.  Its wierd that I felt so comfortable sitting in the basement of SAE with Max, Rick, Eli, Bryce, Marci, and some other folk and felt so detached while sitting in NH and sitting in at Lulus.  It's amazing what a year will do.  No complaints, just an observation at my own patterns.

Class week 2 starts tomorrow.  Marci and I are going to the keynote speaker for MLK day and I am actually pretty excited.  I had ice cream today which is totally yummy and got a Resees pillow from Lisa for Christmas.  Want to get more involved in Best Buddies after the conference and danced and sung during Greek Sing Practice.  It was so much fun...I can't believe I danced for 2 hours today with the PhiKaps.  I was so bad, but it's okay...it's all about the fun.  :)

So, some issues in a lil corner...hoping to just brush them under the rug and have them go away.  Nothing with my life, just with somebody elses which is wierd.  Alright, I am being so vague that even I don't know what I am talking about.

When one boards a plane it is always something of excitment...going hundreds of miles to a new place full of unknowns which can be either magnificent or horrible...there is a feeling of something special and something that makes a stomach ache with a new sense of freshness.  That's not what Sunday is.  Sunday is the opposite.  It is going home to something stifling and cold emotionally.  I cannot bask in my return.  I fret it which saddens me.  A plane ride stands in the way.  At least I have one more day to enjoy.

I looked through old year books today.  I went to Barnes and Nobles and saw an old friend.  I sat there and read for hours.  I played basketball and ran 4.5 miles.  I helped with dinner.  I played a board game.  It's nice relaxing and being home.  I love it here.
On a wierd note, I was wearing his old sweater.  Its kind of wierd to wear it.  It was my favorite article of clothing and it's so comfortable though that I can't not wear it.  Creepy.
My old debate coach is getting married.  She wants me to serve the cake and be in charge of gifts and programs at her wedding.  I am not sure whether to be flattered or offended.  Hrm...  Oh well, don't overanalyze.

I felt at home with friends...I felt comfortable with them...I love them for who they are and they accept me for who I am...thanks guys, you are awesome, no matter how little I see y'all.  Y'all make me smile.  :)"

"event","I was told yesterday by a friend ""keep it to yourself""...I was upset by that.  I feel as if I keep a lot in.  I keep more in than I wish I had to at times.  Please, don't make me keep all of myself in and still ask to be my friend, b/c then seriously, it's not me.  I was told to be the bigger person.  I feel as if my whole life I was supposed to be the bigger person and sometimes, when somebody is explictly lying, I can't take it and feel a need to call them out.  Okay, so I look like the bitch, but I hate when people lie to my friends.  Nough said!

Everybody is pairing off...it's wierd.  I don't want to pair off.  Or maybe I am just not used to being one without a partner in crime, lol.  There are too many conflicts and too much drama for that to never happen again.  I am fine with that b/c I have to be.  I am adapting.

I hate the silence.  Just sitting there, in silence.  It's akward...it's uncomfortable.
But yet, at the same time I know I need to be more silent.  I like pulling myself out and just watching, just observing.  People are so interesting to watch.

Summary of the day: Read two poetry books, sat in my quilt looking out the kitchen window at the snow while drinking green tea, ran 6 miles, went to target, talked with my roomies, and studied...pretty nice overall  :)

I have concluded that the times I feel the most alone are the times I am with the people that I consider my friends.  I rarely feel alone by myself.  It's kind of wierd.  I can't explain.

So apparently I would be the worst g/f ever according to my roommates because I do a ""bait and switch going from cute to siberian wilderness.""  Thanks guys!  That's better than Lauren who Marci said would ""date any dog that was nice to you.""  Ah, aren't we feelin the love in 722?"

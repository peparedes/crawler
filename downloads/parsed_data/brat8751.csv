"event","i realized this past week that no matter how much i care for ppl, i will always get slaped in the face for it. other than becca,karen,jarad,kelly,my other friends dont care about me. i could call here and there once in a blue moon and when i dont call for a while they dont seem to notice that they havent talked to me, i didnt call one friend for over 2 months, not be/c i didnt want to i was just too busy to call, sorry to them. but after those two month i finally call on geri's behalf be/c she wanted to have more friends to go out with at 11:30 at night, but noooo not after soo much time of not talking or hanging, nope they werent even glad to see me, but worst, it was as if i had killed the day....night.... does anyone out there really care if i call them or not???"

"event","i have been reading everybodies journals just to kinda get an idea what everyone is writing and what i should write about. and i find that basicly everyone talks.....i take that back, writes.......what ever is on their mind. i dont think i could go that far into telling the world what im thinking so ill get a little personal, but not too much. ill more than likely keep it basic but ill try to let u know what im thinking otherwise, i just dont want someone to get hurt by what i say and then use it against me....... karen i did have a really fun weekend and same to u becca but i found something different. after five or six long months of feeling odd and alone, nothing against u becca.....i know who myreal friends r be;.c with them i do feel wanted and cared about......Mike u can relate to what im talking about. No one has ever been told.....ok i take that back two ppl have been told.....how i felt but i found that after karen left and becca started to get involved with other things, i felt like i could just drop off the face of the earth and no one would notice.......but then i met Jenn when i started to work and shes like me basicly. and through each other we found that we r wanted and needed and cared for. shut up i know what ur thinking but its not. i just found that i can be happy when no one calls me and when i dont get invited out and when im home on a friday and or saturday night when others r out i know what somewhere someone is thinking of me and soon the clock with ring and the phone will be for me and someone wants to spend the lost time with me..........wow how good does that feel to say...write....that all out and let it be said. it sounds odd but if karen doesnt come down for the next five months i know its not be.c of me but be.c of transportation and if becca goes and does her own thing i know its not be.c of me but be.c she has other friends and the same for jarad and kelly and my new friend mike and if jenn goes same with her. i can handle it when friends dont call and stuff....ill get over it and ill call once in a while but im not going to let my self feel like its my fault that they dont invite me out......who knows this could be all B.S. and it is my fault they dont call.........is it or isnt it?"

yes...so that is from the activist group, ""NOT IN OUR NAME"". They're primarily an anti-ROTC group that originate from Atlanta but now have chapters in California, D.C. and Canada. They're very great. And the people that are in them are amazing people as well.
<lj-cut>

so anyways, post time. I'm bored as shiat. Last nite Juan and i went out for thai food and the waiter kept hitting on us and then said i looked 13. it was strange. i guess because he likes hairy cuban men and 13 year olds.

also, i met a cool online person named Gerald. he's a sports physcologist for the atlanta falcons. and he analyzed my weird fanatasies about teachers. so that was my friday night. 

im really sick now. and i have to wash 3 fucking cars. BLAH!!!!! oh well. <lj-cut>

"event","alright, have not written in awhile. woopsy. 

ok, so this weekend has been fucking fantastic. saturday night was homecoming. the best moments? 

in no particular order except for number 1...

34. corey bubb calling me 7 times, kelly 5 and juan's mom 2 asking if i had the ""Regis"" tie.

3,007. Maddi's boobs flapping in the wind

45. Maddi giving the anonymous men $10, and returning with a drink. she then says, ""What drug do you do with quaters? I think there's acid in this.""

21. The sparkly gold pants and Roney tapdancing.

67 1/2. the homeless man sticking his arm in our car.

3. upon ali barfing into a crystal glass ""EVERYBODY MOVE TO ONE SIDE OF THE BUS!""

5. disovering my love for guava...eating 10 pastelitos at 4 am.

2. Ana flashing everyone...even when we were in park.

6. ""This is a medical emergency!""...refering to my diabetes? or is that anemia? 
And then Juan...""This has quickly escalated into an episode of survivor.""...""and we've already voted someone off!""...""I don't want to eat rats!""

89. The hot dog. gross gina.

1 1/2. Juan's slut of a date twirling around the limo from man to woman to man to man!

and the number one moment of the night...


1. ""Hey guys...um, where's Corey?""

to explain that quote i must explain corey. corey is at least 6 foot 7. easily 250 lbs. AND WE FORGOT HIM! he's twice the size of everyone in the limo combined! so it was quite funny that we left him on soutbeach. woops.

so that was homecoming!

and then we had horror nights! yay sunday night!

the best moments there would have to be..

-""why won't he let us off the ferris wheel?!""...then we found out the people we were with asked to be there longer.

-""oookay, there go's my firstborn son""...benji was a little squished with me and mike in the hanglider ride

-""shit! i made eye contact with the carnie!""...ali and i are always getting hit on

-""SHIT! you's a kicker!""...when ali kicked the black monster in the haunted house

which by the way, the whole haunted house, we all looped our arms and legs and it looked like a huge prison rape chain.

-Ana calling us to say she broke 100 mph on US1

-beji and juan's US! hijinks

and the best of all...

with the black person two feet in front us ...
""PUUUHLEASE NIGGA!""...ali's famous line of the night

it was really really awesome."

all i do is sleep all the time because i feel so depressed. at least my mom says its depression...i know its anemia. so my birthday, on the day of PSAT's will surely suck. but thats ok...i'm only 17. 

im glad not to have the old people in my life anymore, because they were such bad friends in retrospect, but it was nice to do something other than draw on the weekends."

3) tapioca pudding is so yummy. the boogery things are what make or break it.

4) my back hurts to much that i feel like transporting myself into soul calibur II and having my spinal cord ripped out through my anus.

5) i need to apologize to mike for saying the word masturbate. i meant no harm.

6) my mom called me bizarre at dinner. i told her she was an acountant so shut up...pass the fajitas.

i went to a little fiesta at the casa de chelsea, which was very lovely. jill and i watched 3 minutes of My Best Friend's Wedding. 

sorry, i need to ramble more about Tarantino. i realized i wasnt done. The best part of the movie was the characters feet.

so that was friday, i also went to my first viewing. it took 30 minutes to find parking on calle ocho, but we made it. it was so weird, in the room where the casket was, it felt like the air was so heavy. and not to make light of the situation, but it was funny how sandwiched i was between and 7 foot black man and an old abuelito. 

i have to go, but im tired and i dont feel like doing much right now. i'm going to read. make a paper mache grendel and probably watch backed up episodes of crossfire and real time all day long."

The Farewell Transmission
The whole place is dark
Every light on this side of the town
Suddenly it all went down
Now we'll all be brothers of the fossil fire of the sun
Now we will all be sisters of the fossil blood of the moon
Someone must have set us up
Now they'll be working in the cold grey rock, in the hot mill steam... in the concrete
In the sirens and the silences now all the great set up hearts - all at once start to beat
After tonight if you don't want us to be a secret out of the past
I will resurrect it, I'll have a good go at it
I'll streak his blood across my beak and dust my feathers with his ashes
I can feel his ghost breathing down my back
I will try and know whatever I try, I will be gone but not forever
The real truth about it is no one gets it right
The real truth about it is we're all supposed to try
There ain't no end to the sands I've been trying to cross
The real truth about it is my kind of life's no better off
If I've got the maps or if I'm lost
The real truth about it is there ain't no end to the desert I'll cross
I've really known that all along
Mama here comes midnight with the dead moon in its jaws
Must be the big star about to fall
Long dark blues
Will o the wisp
The big star is falling
Through the static and distance
A farewell transmission
Listen


ok it's a cliche sorta crazyness, but whatever, i think those lyrics will mean something to someone else too. comment anyone....testing testing?"

"event","it's so weird when you're in a room with a few people and you're so uncomfortable and there's that nervous energy in the air. i hate that feeling. even more so, i hate it that people have to be so fake. it's one thing to be civilized but it's another to go out of your way to tell people to tell you happy birthday. how fucking strange is everything sometimes? 

it's nice to sit down and talk to people sometimes. i think that (this is for you chelsea) that if people cut through the monotonous BS and said, look, sometimes it's better when everything isn't so fakey peachy keen. sometimes you're better friends. its really true. but you know, sometimes people don't see with their eyes open...i think i understood what i just said, it was a little to Confucious Say for me, but oh well, i havent had a good night of sleep in weeks. 

i feel like recently people are clammering to grab onto someone, anything for support. i know i feel that way, and i tell myself to stop because it will be like it used to be. but my mom and i are good friends now. =).

i just think its better sometimes to do what you want than to do what is expected of you. some people think you have to be this way or that, and like a lot of people i used to be friends with are just completely losing touch with reality. they try so hard to be someone they're not. im not saying names because no one reads this, but it's an easy and callous free way to write. whatever. i used to feel one way, and now, while i get depressed about wanting to be in 7th grade, i feel somewhat elated because i feel better and happier without them. but i wish they'd come clean and tell me it's not worth the BS, because ive said it..and no response.

anyways, radiohead was amazing, more on that later. for now, bed.

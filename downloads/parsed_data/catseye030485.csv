"event","<em>Daddy</em><br /><br />behind bars <br />masking all your pretty scars. <br />you were always all <br />smiles and tears, <br />washing down your pain <br />with junk food and beer. <br /><br />Ashamed to face your fears, <br />-they sat on a shelf, <br />bottled up in a jar. <br />You had nothing to be <br />afraid of then, nope, <br />nothing at all- <br /><br />Just as long <br />as they remained far <br />-far from your heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />--Or&nbsp;else, they would have&nbsp;<br />ripped your body to shreds.--<br /><br />Alcohol solved all your problems <br />-your mistakes, your regrets. <br />Your insatiable hunger for <br />love and security constantly <br />needed to be met--so you fed <br />your body drugs and alcohol <br />to drink. <br />Good nourishment for your body. <br />You were always conscientious like that. <br /><br />Somehow you have always <br />been impervious to death's grasp, <br />holding on to dear life <br />by a single piece of thread-&nbsp;<br />Careful now,&nbsp;<br />Warning: the thread is <br />slowly unraveling. <br /><br />It will not be much longer <br />now before your time is up. <br />Prepare a nice speech for <br />your introduction. <br />-Hell has a seat saved <br />for you right up front, <br />where Satan will deliver <br />your Convocation. <br />Rest in Peace."

"event","We blanket ourselves in our cells
   -shielding ourselves from freedom.
Our minds and bodies have imprisoned
             themselves not by force
    -but by choice.
We are enslaved to mediocrity, and familiarity-

In return we are fed empowerment and strength.

Frightening is the thought of being released
                   from this cell
                  -from this security
                  -this home.
This place is reserved for fools like us-
This secret world is a sanctuary for lost souls
            -for you and me.
It is our comfort, our safety, 
the food we hunt for survival. 

We thrive on simplicity-and we fear complexity.

We are afraid of the unknown and what it has to offer,
   For fear that we must parent ourselves and
   exercise our own knowledge and will.

We dare not tread on uncharted ground,

Nor do we inhabit foreign lands,
   for fear that we may never be able to find
   our way back to what we know
   -and have known all along.

Paralyzed are the mind and body-
when incapable of escaping the hubbub and constancy
     of life outside of ourselves.

Our bodies are engulfed by the flood of life's commotion
    -And our souls are pierced by the lively race
     that surrounds us;
For they are a race of lives truly lived-and us,
    we encompass a race that is dead
    -Dead to Life.
So then what is the purpose for desiring
to find the direct path back to what is
                        familiar?
-after we have experienced and 
               have been exposed to a new world,
 separate from our imprisoned frame.

We would only be returning to our native land,                                    
the land that conceived and birthed our fears,
    our inadequacies, our self-hatred and self-loathing,
    our mirage of happiness and contentment,
    our dependence on isolation and incapacitation-

The Native Land being our own worst enemy-

Thyself."

Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom see the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

"event","Throughout my life, I have always been stricken with very low immunities, but as I grow older, I'm continuing to grow more ill and drowsy-all of the time. I have been suffering from migraines, at least once a week, also, I have always had stomach issues my entire life, which only seem to be getting worse. I am constantly exhausted-whether I receive an exceedingly large amount of sleep, or if I receive an average amount, or if I don't receive enough sleep. Regardless, I wake up feeling unrested. Not to mention, I am never full of enough energy to engage in a typical days' activities. I either sleep in too late, miss half the day, feel sick, either because I need something to eat, or I feel like I am going to vomit for some unknown reason, or my head is killing me; I really do not know what's the matter with my body. Ugh. I've become extremely frustrated about the entire thing though, I just want to feel better. There is a plethora of reasons why I probably feel the way I've been feeling though. Incidentally, I barely eat any meat at all, therefore I do not receive enough protein as necessary to give me energy and strength. But I can't help that fact because, I simply do not fancy the taste of meat, well beef and pork for that matter. I like chicken and turkey, but evidently, these two animals have not been enough to sustain me completely. Not to mention, I don't like vegetables all too much either. I'm not a vegetable eater, never have been. Nor have I been exercising, which therefore contributes to my lack of energy, and overall lack of positive thinking and feeling about myself. Hmm, let's see what else...? Well incidentally, as I mentioned before, I've always had low immunities, for as long as I can remember, as I become older, however, my ailments become worse. As I write this, I feel like something is caught in my throat, my stomach feels unsettled, and my head is hurting, surprise surprise. My body sucks. Sometimes I really hate it. 
Also, lately I've been feeling really uncoordinated; Very accident-prone. Running into something at least once a day, just frequently hurting myself. I don't know what's wrong with me, I really don't. I've just been so clumsy lately, not myself at all. 
Anyway, new business...
 I've been listening to Jewel's album Spirit a lot lately. You are all probably thinking, ""yeah, so what else is new?"" But the truth is, I have been really intimately listening to the lyrics and taking in every word, and this album of her's is so deep, moreso than any of her other albums. I LOVE this album, I can relate to it so much, it's so powerful. I totally recommend it to everybody, there is a song for everyone. I cherish the words so much, I'm going to leave you all with a really awesome song, something for all of you to ponder, and I'm going to go get something to eat with my friend Alex. Till next time, by everyone.

"event","Update, update! It's about time right? It has been ages since I've actually composed an updated journal entry for my lj-ah well. How was everyone's Halloween? Mine wasn't too bad, although, I really wanted to go to a Halloween\Costume Party, but no one I knew was having a party and so, I of course was unable to attend one. However I ended up having fun passing out candy to the trick or treaters while I was working-I had to work on Halloween night at Waldenbooks. The mall was full of trick or treaters, I was passing out candy for almost three hours. The children were soo cute though, in their little costumes, I was like ""Aww..."" hehe Anyway, then my co-worker\friend Carol and I went to the movies that evening, she and I saw the 10:30 showing of Saw 2, and it was good. It was very apropos for Halloween. It was really good though. Awesome flick.
Oh, and here's something interesting and pretty neat, about a week ago I met a couple of the band members of Norma Jean. For all of you who have heard\like the metal band, this should be interesting. I was working at Walden the other night, and a customer of mine, who was also with another person, asked me if I liked the band Norma Jean, or had ever heard of them for that matter. And I responded with, ""Well I've heard of them, and I know a few people who like them, but I don't really know their music or anything."" Well the two customers informed me that the guys standing over by the ""Performing Arts"" section were the band members of Norma Jean. So I was thinking, ""How cool is that!"" So then I decide to walk over to the one guy-crap, I can't remember his name... oops-and ask him if he belonged to the band Norma Jean, and he replied with ""Yes,"" and he pointed to a few of the other members who were looking at other sections in the store. This guy was so nice too, and very down to earth, and he told me he was the drummer of the band. The drummer told me that they were scheduled to perform in Jacksonville and a few other places in FL, but due to the hurricane last week or so, the shows were cancelled, and so they were basically just stuck in Orlando until they returned home to Atlanta, where they are from. So that was a bummer. It was a neat experience. And then his band member Scotty came up to the counter and purchased a few books, so I was able to ring up their items too, even cooler. haha Here's the crazy part though, two nights later when I was working again, I took my half hour break, and during the time I went to the food court to eat, and I saw the members of the band at the mall, again! They were eating in the food court as well. Well I didn't want to bother them again, and so I just kept to myself, and sat down and ate. Then the drummer, whom I previously spoke to, caught my eye and I didn't know what to do but wave. At first he couldn't make out who I was, so that made me feel like an idiot, but then he recognized me and waved back. Then about 5-10 minutes later, he came up to where I was eating and gave me a flyer telling me that his band got a gig that night, at the Social downtown, and he personally invited me, so that was pretty cool. I was happy for him because I know they didn't have really much to do for the past couple of days, considering their shows had been cancelled. Unfortunately though, I could not attend the concert because I was working obviously, but still the thought of inviting me was nice. Overall, it was a really cool experience. 
Well anyway, that's enough for now, I don't feel like writing anymore at the moment.
Peace,
-Rachel

"event","Sadness prevades me. Consumes me. It Haunts me. I just woke up in the middle of the night because I've been having trouble sleeping since the first moment I laid my head to rest and attempted to fall asleep; tossing and turning, head pounding against my skull, because I have had a headache that is quite resistant in that it refuses to go away-caused primarily from my incessant crying and screaming the night before during my lovely, lashing out argument with Katt. I thought that perhaps sleeping would have helped the pain subside, or at least cease a little bit, but little did that do me. 

Anyway, so about the argument with Katt which transpired yesterday evening, I am a complete and total wreck right now-and I probably will be for a while until she and I arrive at some kind of resolve concerning our friendship, which might well have come to an end as a result of last night's conflict: But I honestly do not know yet. Although I don't wish to delve into the specifics of the verbal fight, let's just say that our temperments and our language were quite derogatory, and stinging towards one another-very hurtful-and the whole thing was just very... UGLY, to put bluntly. And I do not mean to sound cliche; Alluding to the word ""ugly"" to describe the unfortunate turn of events that took place between Katt and I last night, was basically the only word that really fit to simply describe the fight. She and I both lost control, and we were making complete fools of ourselves when she, Kristas and I arrived at the restaurant-we both ended up yelling and screaming at one another, and swearing uncontrollably in the restaurant! it was a horrible site, we didn't mean to be make such a scene, but we did. Kristas was so embarrassed, I feel really bad. Not to mention she was forced to witness the entire fight between Katt and I, all the way home from the restaurant, while we were in the car. We had to leave Chevy's, there was no way we could have remained calm and rational, and kept our voices down in that place, we had to get out of there. Katt and I were just way too furious and consumed by so much anger and resentment towards one another at that moment, that we could not simply bottle up our emotions and feelings at that point-they had to be released and exposed, or else the bottle would have burst or completely cracked open, and therefore we had to leave and spill our guts out, inevitably attacking one another during the carride home, and ultimately leaving the leftover debris at the restaurant to rot and grow moldy residue (the remnants left from the argument), but be cleaned up by somebody else-because Katt and I already have much necessary cleaning up to do within ourselves, and each other. So, the fight in a nutshell is, that I may have possibly contributed to the demise of my friendship with Katt-I might have lost my best friend. Hence why I am experiencing complete, and utter sadness right now, that which will be for a while too.

My feelings and emotions are trapped in this gigantic whirlwind, just spinning and spinning, accelerating faster and faster, with no particular place to stop-and so, inevitably my complex feelings just continue to spin, becoming discombobulated, disconcerted, and causing so much confusion and disorder within my mind and myself that I just want to take my chances and jump out of the ever-spinning disaster and pray to land on a safe and stable plane, opposed to remaining in this jumbled and turbulent tumult. God rescue me please from this unwanted state which feels like Hell.

The whole event is just so bizarre. Kind of like acting out an episode of the ""Twilight Zone"" or something. I realize that I am sounding awfully ambiguous at the moment, the reader is probably thinking to himself, ""What the hell is she talking about? How is she equating the fight with being bizarre? or similar to an episode of the 'Twilight Zone?'"" But seriously, I cannot explain myself, all I know is what I'm feeling at this moment, that moment which is frozen in a photograph within the photo album chronicling my life. All I can do is feel right now, and reference what I feel, but I cannot explain myself, because I don't have any answers regarding much of anything at this point in my life. All I know is that which can be felt by my emotions, and my heart. 

I miss her. I miss Katt so much-I've missed her since I dropped her off at her house last night. Many tears have been shed by the both of us. Especially after I dropped her off, then I really just let go of the anger, and the contempt that I held for her, and instead I just simply felt the pain, and I cried. Cried. I just cried. I cried, and cried, and cried. Kristas was right there with me, in the passenger's seat, she knows how upset I was. And still am. I learned that through crying, I feel released, and I am able to forget about my anger, and instead I am able to just feel. And in that moment of simply feeling, with nothing else boggling my mind-not the argument, not the resentment, not the embarrassment-I am able to just be, not concerned with the repercussions of my wrongdoings or anything else, because my mind is completely free of every remaining part of the event-I am released from guilt or thought, and I am seated on the throne of contentment, simply by my tears of mourning.

From my Heart,
~Rachel"

P.S. I really need to take a shower! Hence why I'm feeling really ""dirty"" at the moment. Maybe I should go do that, but unfortunately I can't as of right now, because I have to leave for work, very, very soon. So it looks like I'll be taking one as soon as I arrive home from work this evening. Ugh."

"event","So I feel just out of sorts today. Not earlier today, but more so since the late afternoon\early evening. No specific reason in particular, well let me take that back, there are actually a few things that have kind of sent me tumbling down a big, black hole, but not anything too painstaking to the point at which I shutter with fear at the thought that there may be no escape from out of the darkness. Therefore, I wish not to speak of certain semi-bothersome occurrences, and minor spats that unfortunately took precedence earlier on today-whereas of now, they serve little, to no value, and\or worth.
Anywho, I just feel blah. I desire so much to have a boyfriend. But a good one, a kind, and gentle guy. One who is understanding, and patient, and calm, and considerate of my feelings. I want a gentleman, a romantic, an intellectual, a Godly man, a strong man, a MAN! in general! No more boys! Period. They have all been boys! in a lot of ways. And I am no longer going to settle for these little boys pretending to be men, nu huh, no more, I have decided. I am on the hunt, or even better, on the prowl, (hehe) for the perfect guy. Not the ""perfect"" man of all, but the right, and perfect one best suited for me. The man who God has destined for me. No more of this immature, and juvenile dating crap. Nor anymore of this curious, sexual conduct crap! No more experimenting, no more drinking, no more childplay, or cheesy poetic lines which are supposed to mean something say more profound, or substantial, when in reality the sensual, smooth-talking language is just the mumbling of some avid reader's, romanticized, ""sweep the girl off her feet"" cheap talk, just so the guy can get her, and when he gets her, he can finally play the role of ""I'm the guy, and what I say goes,"" chauvinistic, creep domination bull shit. Their true colors begin to show through these ordinary, no imagination guys, and they can be made out very clearly, and very unflattering to say the least.
Yeah so, that was my lovely, little rant about how despicable the opposite sex can be, in my opinion anyway.
But yeah, moving on...
Sometimes my mind will occasionally breeze over the mystery, that is Life. I mean, as much suffering that exists in the world unfortunately, including all of the evil that permeates throughout the world as well, along with all of the heartache, the innocent lives lost in battle, or those whom never had a voice at all, and had to undeservingly suffer and die from being aborted, and also all of the lies, threats, affairs, brutal murders, etc., that too, are presently transpiring and taking place within the profane world, there is also just as much goodness, and sacredness thriving, blossoming, and alas, it is and it shall continue, always prevailing; Even in the most bleakest, darkest hour-the good and the pure will always supersede the ill-wills, and ill-ways, and wrongdoings, and impurities and injustices, and frailties, which have evolved throughout all of time. And for that, life is fascinating. And suffice it to say, life is good. I believe that the main problem with humanity is that we spend so much of our time focusing our eyes on the bad things, and misfortunes in our individual lives, that we choose to make ourselves blind to everything else. Disabling us to recognize and appreciate the pleasant, and the good aspects of life. Instead we are simply depreciating the value and specialness of those things which we find good, advantageous, and worthwhile. And 'tis one of the huge mysteries of life-aside from life itself. 

I believe I have spoken my peace,
~Rachel Marie Baker"

1. 1% Reduced Fat Milk
2. Bottled Water of course!
3. Honeydew, Watermelon, and 
Fat Free Canned Peaches

Canned Peaches)

"event","**These will be the last three poems from Jewel's book, A Night Without Armor, that I will post on my livejournal, I promise! LOL (At least for a little while anyway. heehee)



""We Talk"" (pgs. 90-91)


We talk
       slowly
about nothing
about movies
       we stick to 
surface streets
       and find no
meaning in cafe windows
no substance in
       hotel rooms
I used to unwrap you!
tender layers unfolding
like eager gold
       but now
we are cool
and recount 
our daily bores
       as though
the sum of our 
       uses
equaled
       something
       (more)
substantial
       while softer
things shrivel
       and dry roots
go unfed
       strangled
by the phone line
and all
       that is
       not said

[This poem reminds me of my present relations with two of my previous lovers (if you will, or boyfriends works also), Daniel and Mike.] 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

""We Have Been Called"" (pgs. 62-63)


We have been called
 naive
as if it were
a dirty word
We have been called
 innocent
as though with shame
our cheeks should burn
So
We visited with
the careful idols
of cynicism
to learn to sneer
and pant and walk
 so as not to feel the scales
 of judgement rub wrongly
But we say
 some things must
 remain simple
 some things must remain
 untouched
 and pure
lest we all forget
the legacy which begot us
the health of our origins
the poetry of our fundamental selves


And so
it is to
the longing hearts we sing
rise! spread
your wings!
Let no hand
nor ill will keep you.

[Isn't this poem incredibly powerful? It's about helping people, giving, opposed to slaving to oneself, changing the world-amazing.]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

""All the Words"" (pg. 69)


All the words I wish your fingers could feel


all the times I've wished
you could know
the silent sorrow
  lying stiff in my throat
like cold
and broken teeth


I wish you could hear
the child that cries
in my flesh and makes
my bones ache


I wish you could speak to my fear


I wish you could hold me
in your arms like oceans
and soothe what my muscles remember
  all the bruises, all the sour hope
  all the screams and scraped knees
the cloudy days so dark
I wondered if my eyes
were even open


The days that I felt
like August, and that I, too
would soon turn
to Fall
 
[I can relate to this poem so much-this poem best desribes my past states of depression, and the desperate need to be rescued from drowning in my own pitt of despair.]"

"event","**Sara, I stole this survey from your livejournal, I hope you don't mind. :) Also, I was curious, where did you get this survey from? or did you just create it yourself?

1)Name the Last Four Things You Have Bought: Ugh, let's see... 1. a cup of water, 2. I had to pay for parking at the music venue, ""The Masquerade,"" in Ybor City where King Diamond performed last night,
3. dinner at Cracker Barrel, and 4. gas for the car

2)Name Four Drinks You Regularly Drink: **(Just to Note: My answer will be in order from my most frequently consumed beverage, to my least consumed drink.) 1. Lemonade, 2. Arizona Lemon Flavored Iced Tea, 3. Fruit Punch, and 4. Orange Juice 

3)When Was The Last Time You Cried?: I honestly cannot recall the last, specific time wherein I shed tears... Which is actually a good thing for me, because generally I cry ALL of the time, about EVERY little thing-regardless of how insignificant. So this is a positive change in my life, because I've been so much happier lately! No recent crying for this little lady! hehe :)

4)What's In Your CD Player?: Jewel's last two albums, ""This Way"" and ""0304,"" Shania Twain's Greatest Hits CD, Switchfoot's album ""The Beautiful Letdown,"" and the WOW 2005 CD-1st Disc. (**I have a five Disc CD Changer.)

5)What's Under Your Bed?: One of those egg crate, semi-mattress type things, in which one places on top of the actual bed mattress, so that sleeping will be much more relaxing, because the mattress is now so comfortable. (I make use of it when I am staying in the dorms, because the mattresses are rather hard and stiff.)

6)What Time Did You Wake Up Today?: Around 9am I think.  

7)Current Hair?: Dirty Blonde (natural hair color, because I've never dyed my golden tresses), leans more on the straight side, and a little below my shoulders. 

8)Current Clothes?: Dr. Phillips P.E. shirt and mascot shorts (gym shorts)-pajamas basically-and underwear.

9)Current Desktop Picture?: On my mom's part of the computer, there is a bright, beautiful Island Scene, that includes the clearest, bluest water, it's so lusciously gorgeous. Then on my part of the computer there is a picture of Drew Barrymore and the actor Dougray Scott lip-locking (this is a wonderful scene from the movie, Ever After. Oh I love this movie, and I love Drew Barrymore! hehe And the shot of them kissing is just so sweet and romantic... Ah... hehe). 

10)Current Worry?: Finding a new job, making and saving money, and college. 

11)Current Hate?: Hate is a strong word, which should not be used or taken lightly, but let me think... Ugh... 1. Forgetfulness (i.e. poor memory), 2. Cold Weather, 3. Superficiality, 4. The Act of Being Money Hungry, 5. Heartless, Egotistical, Jerky Guys who break women's hearts, and 6. Pornography. (In any form or fashion.) **For the record, I didn't take any of the six items listed above lightly-all are very accurate, and extremely abhorred.** 

12)Favorite Place To Be?: Spending Time with the Lord either alone, or in church, and The Beach of course! 

13)Least Favorite Place?: Home alone when I'm incredibly bored.

14)How Tall Are You?: approximately 5'3""

15)Favorite random quote?: ""You need a certain dose of inspiration, a ray from on high, that is not in ourselves, in order to do beautiful things...""-Vincent van Gogh

17)Favorite Day?: Friday and Saturday during the School Year, and any day during the SUMMER! hehe

18)Where Would You Like To Go?: Back to Alaska and New York City, Hawaii (for my honeymoon), India (I desire so much to go on a Missions Trip there, also to see the ""Taj Mahal""), Egypt (The Syphinx and pyramids!) and on a safari somewhere else in Africa, China (to see the ""Great Wall""), Niagra Falls, London, Rome and Venice Italy, Athens in Greece, Spain, Paris, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland (The Swiss Alps!), Austria, (Basically anywhere in Europe!), Israel, I also wish to visit all of the SEVEN Wonders of the World, and SOOO many more places! I would love to simply travel the world... :)

19)Where do you want to live when you get married?: Depends where I am at, at that point in my life. 

20)Favorite food?: Oh boy, too many... Wawa Turkey Hoagie (Wawa Peach Iced Tea, to go with.), Gino's Cheese Pizza and garlic rolls, Whistle Junction's Mashed Potatoes, greenbean casserole, Penne or Bowtie Pasta with Alfredo Sauce, banana bread, ""Chick-fil-A"" Chicken Sandwiches, warm and soft and chewy Chocolate-Chip Cookies, and more... hehe 

21)Color of most clothes you own?: Like Sara, I do not have one specific, dominant color of clothing.

22)Number of pillows you sleep w/?: Two

23)What do you wear when u go to bed?: Pajama pants and a T-Shirt, or just some boxer shorts and a T-Shirt, usually bra-less.  

24)If you could have anything you wanted for a pet, what would it be?: A White Tiger and a Manatee

25)What do you think you'll be doing in 10 years?: I believe that this particular question would be better, more realistically stated if it posed ""What do you hope to be doing in 10 years?"" And so, I hope to be married, with one or two kids by then, and I hope to have already opened my practice, therefore I hope to be a doctor in Psychology at that point in my life.   

26)Are you paranoid?: Everyone is at some point.

27)Do you burn or tan?: Both, I would say.

28)What is the brand of your wallet?: Fossil

29)First piercing or tattoo?: My mom first took me to get my ears pierced when I was three years old, but then they closed up. So then she took me to get them re-pierced when I was five years old, but then they closed up. So finally, she took me when I was ten years old, to get them pierced again, for the third time!, and they have remained open ever since. :) *No tattoos.  

30)First enemy?: This jerky kid who used to harass all of the girls when I was in pre-school.

31)Last person you yelled at?: Mike 

32)Last crush?: egh

33)Last thing you ate?: One cold, chicken leg from KFC in the early morning, as soon as I arrived home from the King Diamond concert-I was starving. 

34)Last traumatizing event?: My recent break-up, but aren't they always traumatizing? They are for me anyway. 

35)Favorite animal?: ALL CATS (Wild or Domesticated), white seals, white tigers, Golden Retrievers, manatees, and dolphins.

36)Who's the best kisser?: No Comment"

"event","""I've learned that not all poetry lends itself to music-some thoughts need to be sung only against the silence.""-Jewel, on ""poetry"" (from preface of A Night Without Armor)

Things have been going pretty well lately, to say the least. Dave and I went to the Orlando Art Museum, so that was nice. The cool thing was that he and I arrived there about an hour before closing time, so admission was free of charge, how awesome is that? I also thought that I had never visited the museum before in my life, until Dave and I were walking through the halls perusing some of the magnificent artwork, and then a memory was triggered in my mind, and at that moment I recalled that I had visited the art museum during one of my field trips when I was in elementary school, so that was a neat recollection. After going to the art museum, Dave and I also watched a movie together, we watched White Noise. I was somewhat curious about the film, but not entirely intrigued by the previews or anything, and suffice to say, after he and I watched it, I was very much NOT impressed-not a movie that I would see again. But, oh well!
Oh, and when I was at Dave's watching the movie, I was able to meet his kitty cat! He's a cat lover! Yayness! He has a black, girl cat, and he named her Midnight, cute huh? Although, I always thought that Destiny would be an awesome name for a girl, black cat-but that's just my opinion. :) Dave also met Pumpkin, my cat, too. He thought Pumpkin was a beautiful cat, but Pumpkin was terrified of Dave! lol My cat doesn't like men, at all! Only girls, heehee. And I made him look at ALL of my pictures while he was here! lol He didn't mind though, actually, he really enjoyed looking through them, come to think of it. So that was cool.

Hmm, let's see, what else? what else? Oh, I'm going to this metal concert with Sheila tonight, we're going to see King Diamond in Tampa. I've never even heard of King Diamond until Sheila told me about the band. There are a few opening acts as well though, as there usually always are at a concert. So hopefully the concert should be fun, I'm not really into metal music, but Sheila loves it, and I enjoy going to any type of concert anyway. The whole concert scene is fun in and of itself. I love the atmosphere of concerts, everyone in the audience is always so passionate about who they are watching perform live, on stage-I think their passion and enthusiasm is so awesome, it's almost as if watching a live piece of artwork, in action. It's so incredible.

I also got my car back... Yay! I'm so happy, and so grateful to have my motor vehicle back, and actually be able to have transportation when I need to drive from point A to point B; i.e. WORK! I need money, and I always feel more productive and responsible when I work, don't you? I'm sure most of you, if not all of you reading this entry can relate. And the best part of all is that, I am now able to drive to church again! WOOHOO! Because before, during the time that my car was waiting patiently for me to come and retrieve it while parked in the parking lot of the shop! (in DeLand! no less), I could not attend church because my mother works on Sunday mornings, she has been for a while now. :( So that was such a bummer, I really missed going to church, but I am now privileged to go tomorrow! and from now on! *smiles* I am really excited about that. Not to mention, I am going to meet up with one of my church friends who I have not seen in ages, she attends FSU, and is now vacationing at home for the summer. Her name is Shannon, and she's very, very petite, she has naturally red hair, and fair skin. She's so adorable, and such a sweet girl, I'm really excited about seeing her tomorrow. Shannon and I are planning on meeting up prior to the service, that way she and I can sit together tomorrow during the sermon. She and I both are members of First Baptist Church of Orlando-it's our home church which we belong. :)

Here's something: I need to clean my room!!! AHHH! It's like a jungle in there, behind my ""closed"" bedroom door. (Just to note: the bedroom door is closed for a reason... hehe) 

Well, now for a Jewel poem (I know, I know, I'm obsessed! haha):

""Sara Said"" (pgs. 48-49)
(Hey Sara, Jewel spells ""Sara"" exactly the way you do! No H! hehe So you should be proud. lol)

i used to screw without condoms
and let the man
come inside me because
i was too shy
to stop him


then i'd go home
and pray on my pillow
please
please
please
don't let me get pregnant


i couldn't sleep
or eat
just think

of my 15-year-old life
with a child
PLEASE GOD
DON'T LET ME
GET PREGNANT


then i would bleed
and find relief
until i was at last
at another man's mercy


an open vessel
whose function it was
to be filled
until my consciousness
could return and
spit out
the bad seeds

[Need I comment on this poem?]

Well, I'm going to end here, take care all!

Happy,
~Rachel"

"event","I'm kind of in one those, ""I don't really feel like writing"" moods. (Yes, I'm aware that I am actually typing, opposed to manually writing something down on paper. But the context in which I am referring to writing, in this case, is the idea of composing something mentally, within my mind.) You might be able to relate to this particular feeling: You know, feeling overwhelmed with having too much to say, and yet feeling worried that you do not possess enough time, energy, and patience to do so? Well that is the predicament that I am presently in, my conumdrum if you will.

So yeah... I'm tired, and I don't particularly feel like thinking at the moment. All I want to do right now is read, and sleep. I don't feel compelled to do anything else; i.e. write. :( But, I suppose I will update my journal a little bit, but not at all in detail. So don't expect to read anything too coherent or concise, because I'm not thinking very clearly at the moment. But anyway, here goes. (Just to note: That was a deliberate, grammatical error.)

I. I saw my counselor yesterday, and that was really, really good. (I see her every Tuesday.) I love Libby, she's so awesome, and kind, I always feel so much better, and so much more alive and eager about life when I leave her office after one of our weekly sessions. *smiles*

II. My mom and I are FINALLY driving to DeLand early, tomorrow morning to pick up my car from the shop. And then I am going to drive my little bugger home. (I call it a bugger because it has cost me, my mother I should say, a whole lot of money, and time, and energy to foster and parent this car!) I will finally be able to drive at my own will again! Woohoo! I will be able to come and go as I please, and not have to worry about whether my mom needs to drive her car or not-because during the time that my car was still in the shop, I would borrow my mom's car sometimes-and I can just turn the ignition of my black Honda, and go! Anytime, anywhere. With no restrictions, and/or curfews. Yay!

III. Tomorrow afternoon, not too soon after obtaining my car, I am going to the Orlando Art Museum, near Winter Park area I should say, with Dave. The outing should be fun, and cultural because I absolutely love and adore art, I admire the beauty and enriching life which is delivered through one's own, unique artwork. Dave enjoys and admires art as well, although he is not nearly as informed, nor knowledgeable about the various famous pieces of art, and/or the artists themselves. But that's alright, I'll educate him. hehe The important thing is that he appreciates the gift and talent of fine art, and that's what is important to me, someone who appreciates, and connects with art, I respect that characteristic in an individual; And that is, including myself. :) I feel grateful, and special to have been exposed to the wondrous, infinite, and imaginative creativity which is elucidated through paintings, and sculptures, and architecture, and drawings, and the like. Oh how I long sometimes to be a part of a magical, enchanting piece of art. Ah... Such infinite Bliss. Complete Serenity.

IV. I'm really cold right now. But then every time I turn the air conditioner off, my blood turns warm, basically hot again. I can't win. I hate my body temperature, I'm screaming at my insides, with abscence of tongue, saying, ""Pick a freakin' balanced temperament for my body! (*body sulking in discontent*) Choose a happy medium darn it!"" Argh! Oh whatever. I'm sure that I'll never be satisfied when it comes to the temperature within a room, or the climate outside, so oh well. ""Sometimes It Be That Way""-Jewel

Ugh, ok, no more babble for the night, or early morning I should say. I shall go read now before I lay my head to rest. Sweet Dreams All! I wish there was someone to sing me to sleep...

                           Dreams, Oh So Sweet,

Think about this:

""Shush"" (pg. 74)


Can you imagine
how silent
a plane crash would be
if you were deaf?


How unbearably loud a rape?"

"event","**Below you will find a few poems that can be found in Jewel's Poem Book, titled-A Night Without Armor. (I love the title of this book. It speaks of such honesty, such naked truth; a still life of one's delicate, bare body frame, in the nude, displayed for all to admire and critique-a work of art, completely uncensored, and unashamed. Utterly exposed, and somewhat exploited, with no means of defense.)

 ""I'm Writing to Tell You"" (pgs. 108-109)


 I'm writing
 this letter to tell you


 I don't love you anymore.


 I don't miss you.


 I never have.


 The truth is, I
 tried, but never found
 your adoration
 anything other than arduous,


 your niceties cliched,


 your praise thoughtless,


 and it has become
 unbearably obvious
 that you love me with
 all the originality
 of romance novels;


 the manly man weakening
 the luscious flower.


 But do not be sad,
 nothing is lost,
 neither of us even loved
 the other truly-
 you only thought you did
 and I only wanted to.

 [This poem says a lot for me.]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 ""Insecurity"" (pg. 103)


 you don't call
 I check again
 I become uneasy-
   is this a frame?
 Suddenly I'm not so sure
 I check my sources
 each conversation becomes a crumb
 how easily I'm led
 how stupid I've been
 to believe
 you could be 
 loving me
 you who can not be seduced
 by anything other than
 the temperance
 of need
   each one facilitating the next
 and suddenly I see my place
 the phone rings
 you say hello
 but I don't believe you
 
 [Oh how this sounds so familiar...]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 ""Blanketed by a Citrus Smile"" (pgs. 99-100)


 blanketed by a citrus smile
 your splash of sincerity evades me
 your aim is not at fault
 I just have no faith left
 for it to stick to


 it is strange how in just
 a few short months
 I can look back on myself
 like a stranger
      and you
 (whom I loved?!)
      are like cumulous clouds
 dull day after day
 with your threats of thunder
 and promises of passion


 I await the blue flame!
 doused in nutmeg!
 wrapped in white linen!


 but as you pass over me
 there is no torrid sea
 no humid embrace


 just pools cooling
 in the small of my back


 I stare at my hands
 and wonder
 how they got
 so far away

by Daniel Bedingfield

If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all

I never know what the future brings
But I know you are here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand 
today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
And know my heart is by your side

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I



I love this song so much, it melts my heart. And the music that goes along with it, is perfect too-incredible, instrumental music to compliment the beautiful lyrics. Ah, blissfulness suddenly overtakes me."

"event","di love musicals. especially really good ones. like say phantom of the opera. i mean i bought the soundtrack and some of the lyrics are soo amazing.im really happy right now. idk i just feel like everything i thought i lost i still have and stronger than i thought. idk its just feels good.somtimes i wish i lived in a musical. i mean think about it. everything gets fixed by singing. and they always no the right thing to say at the exact right time. i want to write a musical but mine would suck. sometime this year im going to sit down and watch all of andrew llyod webbers musicals.

"event","isnt it crazy how well someone knows you even though they have only known you for like five months. i really don't know if i could have handled my life lately without a couple of certain people that i sometimes take for granted. sometimes i find myself wondering if they really understand how much i care for them and how much they influence my life. i mean i love these people so much at times it hurts to think about loosing them cuz in a way it would be loosing part of myself. and now when im talking to someone about when of these people i realize i am so close to loosing one of them i can't believe it. i can't believe i didn't see this sooner and didnt stop it. but maybe youre supposed to realize this before it all happens. to make sure that you really do value them and you understand how important they are and how much they need to be in your life even at times you dont want them too."

"event","i havent updated in such a long time. my one act is well going. its soo sad to talk to someone youve known forever and realize you don't know them anymore. i guess thats the part of growing up no one wants to do. no one wants to admit that sometimes a person isnt ment to be with you for the rest of your life. i was thinking about college and how when i go im not going to keep in touch with pretty much any one from mchenry except a few. does that mean all the friendships and the well be friends forever were in vain if you really hoped you would be? i dont know im really concearned sometimes about what happens if im not friends with this person? would i really be that different? and vice versa, if i wasnt friends with this person would their life be different? i think right now im trying to figure out what everyone else on the planet is trying to figure out, the universal question: Why am i here? so thats it ttyl muah

"event","I'm soo happy i found out the band that sings the song ""cold"" because ive been looking for it forever!! and a day. its crossfade

Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in
Things I cannnot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
Like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold to you

And I'm sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
Cause now i can see
You were the antidote that got me by
Something strong like a drug that got me high
I never meant to be so cold

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me theres just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

I had such a long weekend. An awesome weekend but long.I have made quite a few conclusions. here they are:

1.I have some of the coolest friends around. I love my guy friends they are just so easy going and relaxed. It never fails when i start to have doubt in man kind they come around and make me realize theres hope yet.

2. I'm fricken awesome. like seriously not to be conceited but i think im a good person. i am just reflecting on some of my situations with my friends and im a good friend and i make good choices. so therefor i most definately kick butt

3. Im letting go of everything! i dont care if people dont like me. i have a good head on my shoulders. i dont hate someone for a stupid reason. im tired of being worried that im going to offend people. its over and done with. i dont care. i need to pay attention to things that matter. to my good friends, not the people that hate me. this is due in part to who i might say is an amazing person who made me realize i focus to much on the negative.

thats all folks

"event","this is just going to be a ""what did amanda do today"" entry. so what did amanda do? Well first hour i sat there, took part of my spanish test. Did ok I HOPE and yea that was first hour. man spanish doesn't sound too exiciting but it really is. second hour as soon as i walked into that stupid class i smelled the gross smell of weed. it was nausiating. it made me want to hurl. it was gross. i cant express how much i hate that smell. and of course kris and all of them thought it was mine. (not really but they all said it was to make fun of the fact that im a good kid and im above all that) I realized i didn't find it funny. which is a shocker for me because usually i just laugh at it. But i have lost some friends or other things just because i dont do anything like that. so needless to say i was in a horrible mood. not only because the smell gave me the worst stomache ever, but Phil, my dear Phil, wasn't there. i was soo upset. i love that kid. Gym was gym. i got three guys out. Thats right little old me.  and it was even better cuz i got out the really competitive ones that HATE it when they get out. hehe i loved it. studies was studies. nothing really exciting really. i didn't pay attention at all. but hey i never do. tenth hour we didn't do anything because of some sort of meeting. i hung out with bobby and zach and did our class work and then he let me leave early and go hang out in Mrs. Dunns room. i love being a good kid. See, if you say no to drugs teachers trust me. my one act went well. i got some of my blocking done and i had some good ideas. it was just so much easier once i got the hang of it. i love the people i casted. i really do. so yea.. thats my day. wasn't it great? i thought so. so i have to pick out costume ideas for my one act sometime soon. so yea thats all i got going. ill update later. hugs and kisses. so im offically addicted to my lj now.

"event","Let's talk some more religion shall we? we shall. i can't get it off my brain these last couple of days.i'm starting to think more about all the different religions i know and all the ones i believe and then a weird thought popped into my head. what happens if there isn't a religion i truly believe in. like all the way, heart and soul can put THAT much faith into? i want to find a religion, more than anything in this world, i wish you could box up religion and give it to me for christmas. it would go like' hey i went to the store, and this is the perfect religion for you. see it says so on the box!' that would make it so much easier.  but maybe, just maybe i have to keep looking and asking all these questions i ask and having my doubts in order to get all the satifaction out of it. like the lost sheep does in the Bible. But for some reason i doubt that theres going to be a religion that will say "" hey theres no purgatory."" but i dont know. i kno right now thats what i want to focus on. ive always focused on it, but i mean i really need to stop reading other things and focus. 

but i have my doubts. like if i find one im head over heels commited to, does that mean i have to be close minded to others? im scared to find a religion i can put that much faith into, because that might make it that i can't believe any other form is correct? And its such a intimate thing, religion, well in my opinion it is. it's only you and God/ Buddha/ none. i mean its completely what you believe it. Yea there are some facts about some religious based things but there are facts for every religion. its personal. I mean who could i share that intimate of a connection with? Would i be able to go to church? Would some church people get offended if i went? Being like hey i had to doubt your religion before i thought it was the best choice. and that sentence made it sound like a car.  ok thats it for now

love always,
yours truly"

"event","have you ever just looked back on the past and said "" holy hell! how the hell did i survive that alive and with all the most important things still intact?"" that's how i feel right now. i know some of the things ive gone through arent the most traumatic things but its the avaluanche effect. it was horrible. i dont know how im soo lucky to get out of this past month with all the good things still here. like some of my friends for example. i put so many of them through hell this month. i would just be mad and take it out on them or yadda yadda. you all have an idea of what i could do. and why do they keep coming back? what makes them want more? and ive been so selfish. all i wanted this past couple of months all i cared about is my own happiness, and it was stupid. But then again, i have lost some friends who i cant believe i let go, or friends that i just didn't even realize werent there. its horrible. and those are the moments when i think i let myself down.

You know what its like to sit by when you watch one of your friends get hurt? you know they are going to be completely crushed but can't say anything because you know they won't see it the same. i have that feeling right now and i hate it. i hate the fact that i know someone who i care about is going to get hurt so bad its not even funny but if i tell him he wont believe me or see it the same way as i do. i know i have to agree with him and keep my mouth shut but still, why? 

I was talking to someone today and i realized ' why am i talking to this person? we have absolutely nothing in common. why are friends? If i didn't enjoy him i would hate his guts. i mean he says some of the most gross, discrimative things i have ever heard. but no i still enjoy being around him' i hate it. he can be such a prick and he is. like today, all he did was kick me. the whole period. its soo weird cuz it hurts, but because hes my friend i see it differently. like o thats the way of showing hey this is me caring.sorry, i was just thinking about it today. like, when did this happen? when was it ok to treat me this way and why am i ok with them treating me this way?

And why do teachers feel the need to give so much homework? i understand a teacher is allowed to give homework but why does one give soo much? and then of course complain about grading it? it makes no sense to me . at all. period"

"event","have you ever seen someone you used to be soo close with do something that was totally unexpected and very not their charactic and then it opens your eyes and says ""well hello, you dont know this person as well as you did."" or ""this is me in a whole new light."" ? Its amazing how something so minumual can rock your world in not a very gentle earthquake. Idk, i don't like change,and when someone who i feel like is already changing themselves soo much and then they do something they used to be very much against, idk it threatens my peaceful undisturbed world. I dont know, i was thinking alot about change lately. and how much i hate it. i love knowing that im going to the same class everyday and how everything happens routinely. Yes, sometimes i do mock it, but the truth is, i don't know what I would do if i didn't have my life played out for the next year or so. college is going to be soo scary for me. I'll have to do things on my own, without guidance.I think that's why i need to find a religion. i need to have some guidance, some reassurance that no matter what i do, i can always have alittle help, when my friends all bail and when i focus on all the negative things therell be one thing that will always stay constinant. Well that is, if hell doesn't freeze over and all that junk just as i completely engolf myself  with religion. because hey thats my luck.

i dont know what else to write about. I mean...idk. schools school. Its interesting to see people watch other people. and the funniest part is they think no one can see them. idk thats my observation. drama was drama. people get soo stressed.

"event","Who invented religiong? Do you think that when some guy said, 'hey, im going to put all my faith in a higher power? A power that sure i don't know at all and one that hey could not even exsist for that matter. But I have faith.' Do you think that guys buddy agreed or thought he was alittle of his coocoos nest? Don't get me wrong, I believe in as a trandscendalist says the 'oversoul' but since when and why has it become one of the most controverisal and important parts of life? I believe in a God, but if I didn't that person still makes the same amount of money or at least still can. They can get the same education. I understand why back in the day it was so important, but why is it still important? Maybe because people are afraid to accept the fact that they are alone in life, that maybe just maybe if their life is really screwed up, its all on them. That they don't have the spirit to guide them through it all. But then why do people not want to believe in it? Do they not want to put faith in something other than themselves? Do they not believe we are all part of something larger than we think?

Today was an intresting day. I wrote like one trillion notes because i was just that bored. The people i wrote to though were some people who i miss in my life. Like when i think back to my memories with that person, only good times come to mind. It's funny though cuz looking back on one friend, we've had our share of really bad times, im not lying. But its funny that the brain tends to push the good and push away the bad. Its like that question "" Why do we tend to romantasize the good and belittle the bad?"" or something like that? Sometimes the bad is the best part bc even though its tough to get through, it shows that your friendship can survive it. Or maybe bc thats what makes a friendship strong, and if you loose that person, that will hurt the most. Theres alot of people in the world who will go and have fun, but there are few who really care about you. That you know will hold you in high regard no matter what the situation is. I never knew how lucky i was till right now, writing this entry, thinking back to all the horrible fights i've had with some of my best friends. and thats why they are my best friends i think. 

sorry that was a really long entry about really nothing...

"event","I started this thinking i'd keep it completely private but i changed that. i want it to more open. I was talking to a friend last night and i realized lately that's one of the only people who are really in the loop with how im feeling these days.My grandfather stayed with us this weekend. And it broke my heart to seem him there all alone. This is a man that made me peanut butter and jelly and cheese. ( that combo was actually pretty good). I miss that. You can tell he has no idea with whats going on. I dont know. Just all these memories and thoughts came back to me last night. About old friends i haven't talked to in god knows when. And how much i miss them. But my weekend was really good. I hung out with Laura. I saw Bridget Jones yet again. I love Laura. I'm going to miss her when she leaves next year for college. I'm going to miss all my older friends. Some more than others for obvious reasons. I hung out with Cal to. We went to Borders and I figured out what books I want for christmas. Cal is one amazing guy let me tell ya. Then i talked to Dale on the phone. Sometimes i feel bad for him. I mean the poor guy has to sit there and listen to me complain about how i feel this and that. When one he shouldn't have to do that and two i'm sure he has better things to do at say 12 30 like sleep.But I'm not complaining.So I redid all my terms for stupid American Studies. YAHOO for that!! Just Kidding.I swear that class is going to kill me. But im being a good girl and i read above and beyond what we were supposed to and im thinking about doing my chapter 16 terms just so i stay ahead of the game.

You know what's really weird? not weird but idk.. i was thinking about this past year. All the people i became friends with who i didn't see myself becoming friends with or someone who i didn't even know existed. And all these other things happened. Like the Crucible and my whole experience there. I mean its true that life moves pretty fast. good old ferris bueller. but who would have thought that this time this year i would be on the Thespian Board and nominated to be on the State Thespian Board. And who would have thought i would be in studies, and doing ok in it. And be the type of person i am today? i definately wouldn't have agreed with you.

Well that's all i got."

So i havent written in here in a while so i am now.

I can't quite describe it but I have not been very friendly, to say the least!  No, that'snot quite right.  I've been very stand-offish with alot of people.  Not just Chino but alotof people.  It's almost like I'm trying to distance myself from them because I don't want to get hurt any more.  And it's ridiculous because I know that these people won't hurt me but why risk it, right?  Coming to terms with this whole relationship ending is getting easier.  Not any more plesant, but easier.  It's like i truely just don't give a fuck anymore.  Why should I?  I haven't been given a reason to so I don't see why ishould put in any more effort than I have and, in fact, take away some of it in other areas when it comes to him.  Like, those games we use to play back and forth that I use to find amusing are no longer amusing, just annoying.  And, he takes is as if I'm beefing with him.  It like he has no idea that there is anything wrong.  Like everything is suppose to stay the same because that's the way he expects it.  Fuck that.  I need a reason to do the things I do and I have yet to get a new one so why do it?  <a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f192/ngnoriega/jealousy/NOHARDFEELINGS.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a> I hate ending but some are necessary.  Like tis one.  Because even if he were goign to stay for an extra year, that meant nothing in the long run.  Just an add year of being a piece of ass.  And, no,I'm not being brutal with the description because that what it basically boiled down to.  Being a peice of ass for him and me having a boyfriend.  Sucks, doesn't it? <a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f192/ngnoriega/jealousy/HOTASS.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>  They all do, you know.  Just some of them realize what a great piece of and irreplacible ass they have! lol <a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f192/ngnoriega/jealousy/LEARNINGEXP.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>  I'm tired of thinking that each one has a learning potential.  when do I get to stop learning and actually do?  This is definately going to be an eye-opener for me.  I know the way I use to handle break ups and I don't have any desire to do it that way again.  Who knows? I might start running 2 miles every night out of pure fustration!"

"event","So, he has been made fully aware of how I feel about that damn ticker thing.  I equate it to that death clock.  Has anyone else seen these things?  You apparently punch in your birthday, your habits, such as smoking, drinking, etc, and it's suppose to tell you how long you have to live and it ticks every second away for you.  What the fuck?!?!  Doesn't that take some kind of joy out of living knowing how long you're suppose to have?  And it doesn't take into consideration that fact that you could get hit by a bus, get shot by a psycho ex, overdose unknowingly, get depressed and commit suicide, anything!  But why would you want to know when your last moment be?  Is it that difficult to try to live your life as full as possible without knowing when it ends?  I don't get it.  And, I'd like to know how I'm suppose to have any conversation with him when he refuses to talk to me when he says I'm getting hostile.  Of course I'm fucking hostile!  You're basically telling me that the last almost 3 years of my life has been a waste of time and everything I was led to believe was suppose to happen isn't going to happen!  And now I get that even if he leaves, he'll come back.  So, am I suppose to wait to see if he might come back and if we might be together?  I'm suppose to hold my breath for the possibility that it might happen?  Fuck that.  I said it before to him and he thinks I'm joking.  If he leaves, he leaves.  What's the point in waiting to see what happens?  What changes if he goes?  Why do some people need to loose what they have in order to see what they had?  I'm not like that.  If he goes, I move on.  I can't say I'll go back to being the crazy single chick that went through guys faster than underwear.  Who am I kidding?  That's exactly what'll happen until I don't feel like doing it anymore.  I just didn't want to have to go back there again.  I got tired of it.  Who knows.  All I have been able to do is wait and see and this hasn't changed that."

"event","I feel like mt head is under water and ebery sense my body has decided to acknowledge today has the reaction speed of a 15 second delay.  People have walked by my desk this morning, spoke to me and I have stared at them with a blank stare until what they said registered in my brain and then I answered them.  But, not before they have looked back at me with a look of utter confusion.  Yes, my Monday has begun.....My dear boyfriend took the opportunity to show me what it's like to have a lush boyfrfiend who passes out the moment his head comes within 5 inches of his head.  So, sexual fustration has hit an all-time high after this weekend.  Not to mention that it has become clear as to why everyoine in his family leavse shim alone.  NOt only does he pay for eveythign in that house, he cleans up everyone else's shit, does everyone else's shit and basically plays Superman.  No wonder his mother will get up at 3 in the morning if he drunkenly calls and says he's hungry.  He tried to do this to me once.  I tld him Taco Bell is open late for drunken assholes like himself and hung up.  And, thus, my Monday has begun.....I was informed at 10:30 last night that there was no school for Aria today.  Normally, this wouldn't have been a big deal but my grandmother decided to go to Orlando for the whole week and I had no one to stay home with her.  So, last minute, she ended up having a sleep over at her new best friend's house and will be hanging out with her today.  And since I didn't know about this sleep over until 11 last night, I spent the night laone because the boyfriend had to help his sister clean up the garage she destroyed before their mom got home from California.  Hence, my Monday has begun............Someone please put me out of my misery before I kill someone.  Have ahppy Monday! ;o)"

This excuse I keep getting of ""I fell asleep"" isn't working the way it use to.  Especially when I know you had a 4 hour nap in the afternoon after we go back and I know you can't sleep after doing that.  AND, supposedly you were suppose to have a dinner thing with a new kid joining.  Since I spoke with at 6:30-ish and you still hadn't done the dinner thing and I texted you at 8 something, and you said this morning ""Sorry I didn't call you back.  I feel asleep"".  Now, I know I play naive well but do I honestly have you that convinced that I never have a clue as to what's going on.  I know more than I ever let on.  You're too easy to figure out sometimes.  Now, the question on my mind isn't what you might have been doing because for all I know, you could have been sleeping.  What I want to now is why I still do this.  Why I stay around.  Why I have not been able to walk away from you.  Why I insist on driving myself crazy.  Why I let myself believe you.  Why I lost my mind and have yet to retreive it. How can I possibly trust you with my life and everything else but I have such a hard time believing anything that comes out of your mouth?  I know I nod and smile like it's okay, but I don't think I've believed a single word for the longest time that I can't even remember when I started!  So why do I stay?  Why do I let you do it?  This ""on-off"" switch you think you are going to be able to turn on a permanent off is complete bullshit and I've told you this but you have this insane faith in it! I don't get it.  Knowing full well on how you are and you still believe your own bullshit.  Simple amazing.  That's it.  I just needed to get it out as to keeping my anger in control and not choking the next fucking idiot who comes near me today!"

I now have a grown up looking bedroom.  Or, so my younger sister has stated to me while sitting on my bed last night watching Grey's Anatomy as I moved in my new antique furniture.  Of course, she wasn't helping other than telling me where I should put things but the comment came out none the less.  I am in LOVE with the furniture!  I moved my bed by the windows (which the dear boyfriend hates for some unknown phobia-ridden reason!), placed the new night stand next to my bed, which I placed the Tiffany lamp on and moved my new bureau against the wall with a beautiful circular mirror above it and, for the my most favorite piece, a writing desk and chair.  I have always wanted a writing desk since I can remember and now I have one.  I'm still organizing everything in the room but it's shaping up to be me.  And after having the second day from hell due to my work place and running on about 3 hours of sleep, I moved it all by myself, got Aria to bed, threw myself on my bed to have the boyfriend ask me for a hug.  I proceeded to vent in a rage as to why I should be getting a hug and had to laugh because I was too tired to punch him in the head.  Then, of course, that's when I get the sweet smile and he says, ""You see, I got you to laugh.  Doesn't that feel better?""  How can I argue with someone who makes complete sense?"

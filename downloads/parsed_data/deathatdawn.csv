"event","My grades suck ass, HELP! Its only been 3 weeks of school and 90% of my grades are 60 and below.... i dunno wtf is wrong... but i guess ill try a lil harder :-\, Today... hmmm.... it was ok, was depressed to the extent that meh medicine didnt work for a long while.... Jessica ( the person i also look dearly too) broke up with the goat roper... the gay fag should be hung and beat with his ont testicles.. but wait he dun have ne, the goat ate them.... eh... cough*  Hmmm Brit is still dating the 18yr old :-\, ima get over it sooner or later, forgot to add this in my previous entries but me and lauren are well kickin it again we had a huge fight or something a while back and now were friends.... Matt proposed to Lauren ^^ Matt asked what i thought of it and well all I could come up with is i dunno, but truly i feel that if you love someone that much to propose to them, i think its true love, i wish i could tell brit everything that i feel and like about her but i would get the same old thing... "" My parents wont let meh date you "" soo o well... i guess theres others out there.... and then again i think brits right for meh but she never gave me a chance :-(. ok off the love subject, Me and matt are making this band right, well we are ify on our bass player, he likes ta play the bass but he just isnt the black metal type.... but i think he'll do for a couple of shows, Collin, our 2nd guitar'ist is egar to meet everyone and show us his skill, i cant wait till one of our breaks, cause matt will have his truck up and running and collin already drives, all i gotta do is pick up our bassist and we have an official session, i hope to have at least 3 songs done befor this year comes to an end, then, well, we'll write more, well, nature calls and im getting tired, lata"

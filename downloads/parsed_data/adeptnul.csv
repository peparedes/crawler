I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hold
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus:]
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus:]
What have I become
My ssweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

When a country obtains great power,
it becomes like the sea:
all streams run downward into it.
The more powerful it grows,
the greater the need for humility.
Humility means trusting the Tao,
thus never needing to be defensive.

A great nation is like a great man:
When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.
Having realized it, he admits it.
Having admitted it, he corrects it.
He considers those who point out his faults
as his most benevolent teachers.
He thinks of his enemy
as the shadow that he himself casts.

If a nation is centered in the Tao,
if it nourishes its own people
and doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,
it will be a light to all nations in the world.

"event","Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead by armed British police officers at Stockwell tube station because, they claim, he was mistaken for a suicide bomber.

I hope that those responsible for his death are brought to justice and given the longest possible prison term for his murder. The 'shoot to kill to protect' policy is, in my opinion, a totally outrageous step. It has already directly caused the death of an innocent man, how many more must die just so the politicians and police can give us the illusion of safety.

On the information available at the moment it appears the police operation was botched. They were in plain clothes and armed, keeping watch on a block of flats in which they suspected people linked to the recent failed bomb attacked may have lived. It is a block of flats, so it should have been obvious that most of the people coming and going would NOT have any links what so ever with terrorists. 

Apparently Jean Charles was picked out by police because of his 'bulky' clothes. Well if that is all it takes to arouse the suspicion of armed police these days then we are all in big trouble. He was allowed to leave the flats and get on a bus. Why, if he was considered such a potential threat, was he allowed to get on a bus without being stopped? My conclusion is that the police felt it more important not to 'show out' at the observation on the flats than it was to protect the public. So lets get this straight folks, a police obs is more important that public safety. 

He then gets off the bus and is, apparently, challenged by plain clothes armed police. Given that Jean Charles is reported to speak perfectly good english and has been stopped recently by police with no problems, do you think it is more likely that they failed to identify themselves properly as police officers. Jean Charles then ran into Stockwell tube station, chased by these plain clothes gun wielding 'cops'. 

What happened next is a bit hazy and hopefully the full truth will come out in time. The eye witness reports indicate that the police officers had Jean Charles on the ground and then shot him 8 times, causing his death. If this killing had been carried out by the mob then the police would probably have called it 'an execution style killing'. 

My questions are...

Why did police let Jean Charles get on a bus?
Why did they not pull over the bus before it got near Stockwell tube station?
Did they really identify themselves clearly as police officers?
Why, when they had him on the ground, decide to shoot him 8 times?

This 'shoot to kill to protect' policy is madness. It only works if you shoot first and ask questions later, which means a lot of innocent people are going to get killed. If the police are willing to let suspects wander onto buses and tube stations and only then shoot them, how exactly is this policy protecting the public?

I see that politicians are falling over themselves to support the police. Now that we have armed police on the streets with shot to kill orders how is this different from martial law? And how is this effective coup possible in what is meant to be a democracy. When was this policy voted for, or even discussed, in parliament. If we are now living under martial law then I, as a freeman, retain the right to protect my liberty and person from the government and the forces of martial occupation. I will carry out passive resistance as and when necessary until martial law is lifted. I will not co-operate with the government, armed forces, police and judiciary. 

What has happened to the presumption of innocence? Jean Charles was not presumed innocent, and the policy mandated the death penalty for his offence of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If we truly are in a 'war against terror' then the execution of Jean Charles de Menezes is a war crime!"

If you want to be a great leader,
you must learn to follow the Tao.
Stop trying to control.
Let go of fixed plans and concepts,
and the world will govern itself.

The more prohibitions you have,
the less virtuous people will be.
<b>The more weapons you have,
the less secure people will be.</b>
The more subsidies you have,
the less self-reliant people will be.

Therefore the Master says:
I let go of the law,
and people become honest.
I let go of economics,
and people become prosperous.
I let go of religion,
and people become serene.
I let go of all desire for the common good,
and the good becomes common as grass.

Those who know don't talk.
Those who talk don't know.

Close your mouth,
block off your senses,
blunt your sharpness,
untie your knots,
soften your glare,
settle your dust.
This is the primal identity.

Be like the Tao.
It can't be approached or withdrawn from,
benefited or harmed,
honored or brought into disgrace.
It gives itself up continually.
That is why it endures.

"event","Wrestling with the concepts of Zen teaching is quite tricky. It seems to be one of those things where you read about it and just don't get it but the mind files it away, and then suddenly at some later date it makes complete sense. Take for example the concept that we are already enlightened, that we need not sit Zazen or resolve Koans. I was just sitting Zazen with the patio door open, and looking out in to my garden as the light faded. The crescent moon up above set againt the inky blue of the cloudless sky. And then it clicked in to place.

I am enlightened already, but enlightenment is like the stars. We can only see the stars at night when the sun has gone down and the clouds have parted. The sun is the ego-self which is so bright it hides the stars. By sitting Zazen it is possible to dim the sun and experience the cloudless night sky full of stars."

I was baptised a christian.
I have lived mostly as an atheist.
I have studied and practiced the Occult and Magickal arts.

And now? My path has come to Buddhism. I have read books and joined in discussions in online forums. I have sat Zazen. And I have glimpsed a bigger world, I have experienced something that is beyond my ability with words to explain. Not an enlightenment, but a change in myself, an understanding that that which I have been before has been leading me here.

How should I proceed? I consider myself a Zen Buddhist. Should I shave my head? Run off to a temple? The Buddha taught that a lay person can achieve enlightenment. So really is there a need for grand gestures? I think it is enough to say 'I am this' and live my life in this way. And so I pledge to follow the precepts to abstain from...

Someone I know posted this link on their blog as an example of an amusing site we might all like to visit. Apparently it is 'ironic'. What exactly is 'ironic' or funny about this hate site? Sure the guys who put this together are obviously just bored middle class idiots who are trying to get a rise from animal lovers and horse owners...but why is this amusing?

Lets see some of those oh so funny quotes from the site...

<i><b>""Yeah? Fags gallop and frolick too. Why don't you gallop to the glue factory you fucking galloping fag!!""

""Which cops are more faggy? The cops on the scooters or the cops on the horses?""

""I am Hitler. Horses are Jews.
Fire up the fucking gas chambers.
fucking horses.""</i></b>

Sheesh, my side are splitting, stop with the fun already. 

So we live in a fucked up world and wonder why. This site is as good an example as I have seen recently. It is considered funny by intelligent people that compassionate animal lovers get angry about sites like this. I know, lets start a site called 'I hate Jews' and have a good laugh when people get angry. Oh, thats not funny? Why? You said the 'I hate horses' site was funny, so how come you don't like the idea of 'I hate Jews' or 'I hate cripples'? 

The comedy of cruelty is NOT funny. Trigger Happy TV had some amusing sketches like the guy in the snail costume using the pedestrian crossing, but what exactly was funny about the genuine concern of the celeb who was accosted in the street for the fake interview and Dom Jolly then staggers away pretending to be in extreme pain. Compassion is funny? Since when? If you see someone laughing at a rape victim don't be surprised, this is the kind of world we are helping to create with the comedy of cruelty. 

Cruelty to animals is not funny. Cruelty to people is not funny. Hate is Hate, however to try and dress it up. As you sow, so  you reap.  

http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Karma/id/22805

<b><center><i>Whatever you sow by your actions come back to you. If you make others happy through service, charity and kind acts, you sow happiness like a seed; and it will give you the fruit of happiness. If you make others unhappy through harsh words, insult, ill-treatment, cruel acts, oppression, etc., you sow unhappiness like a seed; and it will give you the fruit of pain, suffering, misery and unhappiness. This is the immutable Law of Karma.</i></center></b>

I used to find these kinds of sites amusing, but now I see them for what they are. Hatred begets Hatred. How can people that object to racist comedians and shock-jocks find 'I hate Horses' to be funny?

The Eightfold Path <i> ""is a practical guideline to ethical and mental development with the goal of freeing the individual from attachments and delusions; and it finally leads to understanding the truth about all things.""</i> The teaching shows us clearly that 'I Hate Horses' and sites like it are at odds with 'ethical and mental development'...

Right View - Since our view of the world forms our thoughts and our actions, right view yields right thoughts and right actions.

Right Intention - The intention of harmlessness, meaning not to think or act cruelly, violently, or aggressively, and to develop compassion.

Right Speech - 1. to abstain from false speech, especially not to tell deliberate lies and not to speak deceitfully, 2. to abstain from slanderous speech and not to use words maliciously against others, 3. to abstain from harsh words that offend or hurt others.

To quote Alan Bennett...<i><b>""I saw somebody peeing in Jermyn Street the other day. I thought, is this the end of civilization as we know it? Or it it simply somebody peeing in Jermyn Street?"".</i></b> I am aware that my reaction to 'I hate horses' might be seen as an over-reaction, that I am reading too much in to what is simply a rather sick joke site on the internet. That may well be the case. I am certainly not advocating censorship and the imposition of an ethical and moral code upon others.

"event","I have been experiencing a lot of mixed up emotions recently, which in part seem to be a by-product of my Zazen. Someone pointed me towards this article...

<b>I Think of Demons

by Brad Warner</b>


I woke up at one a.m. from a nightmare of broken shapes and unfamiliar sensations into a waking nightmare of inescapable panic, in a cold sweat, my heart racing. The only thing in my mind was sheer black terror. 

I sat up, looked around. Indistinct shapes in the dark. Where was I? Not at home. I was on the floor. A big room. A temple. I was in a temple. It was Tokei-in temple. I recited it to myself. Tokei-in temple in Shizuoka. The strange shapes were other people sleeping in the room, all of them friends. It was the first night of the Summer Zazen retreat. There was nothing anywhere near me that could do me the least harm.

Then why was I so afraid? Wake-up call was at 4:30 when the next day's Zazen was set to begin. No one wants to be gotten up at one o'clock when they have to get up again just four hours later. So I tiptoed out of the sleeping room, slid open the ancient wooden door as quietly as possible and went to the main hall of the temple. At least there were lights on out there.

Here I was in surroundings of complete serenity devoting my days to the pursuit of inner peace through the silent practice of Zazen. What could possibly be less frightening? Still my breath came in panting gasps and my pajamas were soaked with sweat. I was shivering as hard as a naked man sitting on a block of ice, although the night was pleasantly cool. I had never felt such panic in my life. If I'd been being pursued across an open field by a tribe of hungry allosauruses I couldn't have felt more intense fear. All the fear I'd ever felt in my life had descended upon me that night.

I sat on a bench facing the Buddha statue in the center of the main hall, a few feet from the spot where Nishijima Sensei had lectured to us a few hours earlier. I worked hard to try and resume my normal breathing patterns, to hold my body still against the shivering. I tried to think of anything real that was even potentially dangerous around here. Earthquakes? I was awake now so even if there was one, I could get to a safe place. I tried hard, but couldn't think of anything else. 

Gradually, I forced myself to return to normal. The dream I'd had was some kind of subconscious message. Something I'd been doing was causing me some kind of distress and I wasn't even aware of it. I thought about the dream and I realized what it was and what I would have to do. As surreal as the images had been, there was a message in them which I could interpret consciously. I was going to have to give up something I really enjoyed in order to save my mental health. It wouldn't be easy, but I resolved to do what had to be done. When my heart rate had settled and I could breathe normally again, I slid back into the sleeping room and crawled into my futon. Eventually I settled my mind enough that I fell into a troubled half-sleep.

Zazen practice is like taking the lid off of a boiling pot. All the stuff inside your mind wells up and spills over the edges. It can be messy. 

All day long, every single day, you repress various thoughts and urges that appear in your mind. You have to. All of us have nasty antisocial tendencies. Every last one of us. It ain't just the Nazis, Al Quaeda, the Baby Badger Rapists In Your Very Neighborhood or whatever enemy-of-the-week the media is pushing who want to sodomize helpless farm animals, pull the wings off butterflies and spit on the American flag. It's you. Yes you, sitting there with your finger up your nose reading this on your computer screen. Maybe you don't have any of those specific urges (you believe), but you have others and they're just as nasty and disgusting.

It's all tied in with our self-image, our ego. Everyone has a self image. You have one, I have one, Dogen, Nagarjuna and Gautama Buddha had one too. The difference is the way a Buddhist views his or her self image.When a person who understands Buddhism uses the word ""I,"" the word is just a convenient way of locating something. ""I"" is used in the same way most people would use ""the chair,"" as in, ""Put the book on the chair."" You don't have any really strong attachment to the chair. You know it's really just a bunch of boards held together with nails and screws, that the boards had their origins as parts of trees and the nails and screws were once parts of rocks in the ground. The chair will come apart eventually. But none of its components will ever really disappear. They just change form. And though they don't disappear, there comes a time when they can no longer be called a chair anymore. After this point you can never reassemble that chair again no matter how hard you try.

It's very difficult to reach this kind of understanding when it comes to your sense of self. We've been taught since birth that our ""self"" is something fundamental and real. But our ""self"" isn't really anything but the sum total of those particular things about the universal human nature we've chosen to emphasize in our own lives. Some teachings like to differentiate between ""self"" and ""Self,"" but this just obscures the problem with unnecessary complications. No matter how you spell it, self is an illusion. Anyone who tells you otherwise is fooling you and himself as well.

Society conditions us to ignore certain aspects of universal human nature because these aspects go against the preservation of society. You can't have a functioning society if people are running around raping, killing and stealing all the time. Raping, killing and stealing are just the tip of the iceberg. There are billions of more subtle urges we all have which are anti-social and these need to be repressed too. Different societies pick different things out of the stew of universal human nature and label these ""anti-social."" True right and wrong are entirely different from society's definition of right and wrong.

So you go through your whole life repressing this stuff so quickly and efficiently that most of it doesn't even have time to enter into your conscious mind as a thought or idea. But when you do Zazen, you are sitting in a state where these mechanisms of psychological repression begin to become a little more fluid. That's when the demons pop out.

Some people may find these repressed thoughts so alien that they take on abstract shapes or appear in the form of hallucinations. The demons represented in ancient paintings and sculptures or spoken of in old legends are nothing more than this. Those beautiful drawings in Tibetan Buddhist art are representations of all the things that distract a person from finding the truth. It's too bad so many folks get confused and think these depictions are of the truth itself. One time I heard the entire song Kashmir by Led Zeppelin just as if there were a radio next to me. I even looked around to see if someone had brought one into the room.

In traditional Buddhism they call this phenomenon ""Makyo"" or ""the world of demons."" Gudo Nishijima, my teacher, will tell you, if you ask about it, that there's no such thing as ""makyo."" I would not dispute this. There is no such thing as Makyo. There is no World of Demons. But I do think it's important for people who practice Zazen to be aware of this kind of thing from the outset of their practice.

If your Zazen practice is reasonable, if you're not doing too much, or striving too hard to reach some goal of ""Enlightenment,"" you may never experience anything quite like this. Or if you do, you'll only meet up with it at a time when you can handle it. To experience such phenomena is a sign that your practice is maturing. The key is not to get sucked into it. Don't get frightened by the scary ones and don't get seduced by the seductive ones. Above all, preserve your ego. Meditation teachers who tell their students to destroy their egos are the most irresponsible people on Earth. Dogen said that realization doesn't destroy the individual, just like the reflection of the moon in a dewdrop doesn't destroy a dewdrop. A dewdrop is big enough to reflect the whole Universe. It's not that your ego needs to be destroyed. You only need to understand it for what it really is, a mechanism for allowing you to function as part of society. 

When these anti social urges come up, you can feel, as I did, that it's evidence you're not a good person. You think you're just pretending to be good when really you have all these terrible urges. Since the terrible urges are part of your mind, you think they must be part of ""you,"" that they are in fact ""the real you"" and that the nice, normal ""you"" society knows is just a farce. That's not the way it is at all. That kind of thinking leads a lot of people down very dark paths. They turn to weird religions or drugs in an effort to destroy these thoughts. Or worse, they begin believing they must express their ""true self."" But everyone everywhere has urges like you do. You can only do good when you understand clearly what bad really is.

When urges to behave badly appear in your mind, you don't give in to them. That's what morality is. The biggest, ugliest, most damaging lie that religions spread is that truly moral people never have immoral thoughts. Bullshit. It's not that you only have moral thoughts. It's that you only act upon the moral thoughts you have. Lust that appears in your heart is not a form of adultery. Adultery is adultery. Lust in your heart is something no one can ever avoid. There are people in this world who set themselves up as being above having ""impure thoughts."" In America they give folks like this weekly TV shows (thank God, the rest of the world has yet to adopt this custom!). Those people are liars who seek only to manipulate others, getting fat on their guilt. A person can get very wealthy doing this kind of thing.

The shrill clanging of the brass wake-up bell shattered my uneasy rest a scant few hours after my encounter with demons. I got dressed, washed may face and staggered through the cool morning air into the Zazen hall to start another day of staring at a bare brown wooden wall. That morning at the lecture someone asked a question. I can't remember who asked or even what the question was. But in his answer, Nishijima Sensei said, ""Just stop drinking alcohol."" I caught his eye at that moment. He was looking straight at me. I smiled, he smiled back. I didn't have a drinking problem. In fact I really hate alcohol, never drank much and hadn't had any at all for a few years by then. But what he said penetrated right to the heart of the problem. The words themselves didn't matter. It was direct communication. Did he know it? Did he realize what he'd said? At the moment of direct communication, such things really don't matter."

I keep coming back to the big question...<b><i>What is the meaning of Life?</b></i>, and coming up with nothing for an answer.

I <i>know</i> that there is more to life that I currently experience or understand, but what is it? I sit Zazen and clear my mind, still the turbulent waters of the pond and little by little the waters are calming and I do seem to be making slow progress. I have been feeling a lot of mental anguish recently which is not helped by the fact that I may lose my home, but it seems that I have to experience this anguish as part of the process. I am not very good with words and it is hard for me to get across my experiences and feelings, I don't think a career as a writer is around the corner :p"

"event","I wonder what life is all about. Rich get richer, poor get poorer. Obesity on the rise whilst people starve to death. 

There is the option to just ignore all this and thank my lucky stars I was born middle class, white and healthy in a first world country which allows me the indulgence of being melancholy. Or I could throw myself in to aid work and politics to try and make the world a better place. There is a third way, do nothing. Yes, do nothing. Let the world revolve around me whilst I stay still at the centre, unmoved and unmoving. I am not part of the problem, I am not part of the solution, I just am. If enough people chose this path then the world would settle, the machine would stop, pause for a moment and in that moment the greatest potential for reprogramming.

"event","I have for some time been experiencing a cyclic depression and a crushing feeling of the futility of human existance. At times it feels that life is just grinding me away, that I have lost all control over the course of my life. I get relief from scoring my arm with a compass needle, marking myself with patterns and shapes. 

It occured to me that this can be seen as a magickal act. I am asserting my will, controlling my pain, remapping my experience of the flesh. Often in sigil work I attain gnosis through pain, self harm is just an extension of that work but acting in the immediacy of the pain I can inflict upon myself. 

So the next step is to cut or scar sigils into my flesh, much like getting a magickal symbol tattooed onto my body. 

I was talking to a young lady in a club once (she must have been about 18 or 19 years old) and she had her arm bandaged and covered with some cloth (it was a goth club). She self harmed but in a negative way, she was (I assume) ashamed of her self harming and so chose to cover up the cuts on her arm. It seemed sad to me that she chose to hide these wounds instead of taking control of this act and making it a part of her life. 

Obviously the subject of self harm is complicated and I do not claim to have enough knowledge of psychology to offer advice, but maybe if people were able to be open about their self harm it would become a less negative aspect of their lives. 

If all acts of Will are magickal acts then the act of taking a compass needle and scoring marks and cutting my flesh is, to me, very magickal indeed. Pain is how we know we are alive, and taking control of pain is a way of stopping being a victim, a way of taking back control."

<b>LBRP - Lesser Black-Squirrel Ritual of the Pentagram.</b>

1. Touching the forehead, say <b>Nuts</b>. 
2. Touching the breast, say <b>Acorns</b>. 
3. Touching the right shoulder, say <b>Walnuts</b>. 
4. Touching the left shoulder, say <b>Almonds</b>. 
5. Clasping the paws upon the breast, say Lerriuqs. Facing East, use the index claw of the right paw, trace a large (Flaming Blue or Brilliant White) banishing pentagram of Earth. Charge it with Light by piercing the index claw through the center of the pentagram and vibrate ""<b>SYCAMORE</b>"". Keep the arm extended while tracing a line of white Light as you turn or move to the SOUTH. (Keep the right arm extended throughout; never let it drop.) 

Facing South, trace another large bannishing Earth pentagram . Charge the pentagram as before by thrusting the claw, through the center of the pentagram and vibrate, ""<b>FIR</b>"". Keeping the arm extended, trace a line of white Light as you turn or move to the WEST. Facing West, trace again a large bannishing pentagram of Earth. Charge the pentagram as before by thrusting the claw, through the center of the pentagram and vibrate, ""<b>WILLOW</b>"". Keeping the arm extended, trace a line of white Light as you turn or move to the NORTH. Facing North, trace a large bannishing Earth pentagram. Charge the pentagram as before by thrusting the claw, through the center of the pentagram and vibrate, ""<b>OAK</b>"". Keeping the arm extended, trace a line of white Light as you turn or move back to the EAST. Facing to the East extend your tail and say, <i>""Before me RAPHAEL</i>"" (Rah-fahy-el). Visualize before you the great Ninja Turtle rising out of the sewer. Behind you visualize another figure and say ""<i>Behind me BULWINKLE</i>"" (Buhl-win-Kel). See the Moose stepping out of the forest. See to your right another figure in fish net stockings and basque, Say ""O<i>n my right hand Frank N Furter</i>"" (Fran-ken-fuh'ter). See a yellow mouse at your left, who rises up from the vegetation of the Earth. Say, ""<i>On my left hand PIKACHU</i>"" (Pee-car-chew). (Say) ""<b>For about me flames the pentagram, and in the column shines the sacred Acorn.</b>"" 
Banish thrice with Laughter.   

Then preform the Black Squirrel Ritual."

"event","<b>The nature of Chaos</b>. I see Chaos as being that from which everything comes. It is an energy in constant flux, ever changing, cycling through all probable permutations. So from chaos will arise order, and from order the reality in which we reside. Underneath our ordered reality the process of chaos still takes place, but the cycle of probable outcomes for any event has been reduced.

<b>How chaos magick works</b>. Because of the underlying chaotic nature of reality (or concensus reality if you will) we can manipulate the probable outcomes to make reality conform to our will. Of course it is going to be much easier to get a probable outcome than an improbable one, so no fireballs from fingertips i'm afraid. Actually it might be possible to do that, just not very probable 

<b>Non-dogmatism</b>. The non-dogmatic, more freeform, nature of chaos magick is very attractive to many of us here. No need to learn that long boring ritual, just cut to the chase and do-for-effect! The danger here is that we become lazy. It is important to have an somewhat devil-may-care attitude whilst being serious about our work. So feel free to mine comics, movies, porn, anime etc for ideas but be true to the source material. Just as a ceremonialist might research Mars before in invocation so we must get into the role of 'Vampire Hunter D' or the 'Judderman'.

It is NOT my intention that DSP become a 'chaote only' organisation. I want to have people involved from all areas of Occult practice, be they Wiccan or Pagan or Enochian or Freestyle Shamans...the point is to work together towards a common goal. The goal is dispensing <b>Karmic Justice</b>. But what does this actually mean? Who are we to dispense Justice on others? 

My idea is that we hold to account those that wrong others. This might be a noisy neighbour who ruins the life of the people in the flat below. It might be the person that lets his dog foul the kiddies playground. It might be a corporation that polutes the air and exploits its workers. DSP is a socio-political magickal group of like minded individuals working to alter concensus reality to our collective Will. That might be a simple Sigil working or a month long ritual. It might draw upon the power of the gods or just alter perceptions with an act of art-terrorism."

"event","Chaos magick is known as a 'results based' system. I just wonder if we sometimes are more concerned about results and don't want to discuss our failures. Often we learn more from failures than success and even the Uber-Magus is going to fuck up sometimes, unless they have restricted themselves to doing magick they know and don't ever try anything new. 

Does my sigil failure make me a crap chaote? No, it just means I tried something new and didn't pull it off. The failed sigil is recorede in my magickal diary/workbook and is something I can refer back to in the future and tinker with to try and get it to work. 

Fear of failure is a cage of our own making. Fear of anything is a cage. You have empowered the 'thing' and weakened yourself. I just think to myself these days ""what is the worst that can happen""...it doesn't seem so bad after that. I do not fear failure because it is a necessary part of progress and 'doing'. Sure you might think of me as being less of a chaote/magus/adept blah blah blah, but then to crave adulation is just the ego taking over. If I only talk about my success does it help me, or anyone else, improve and grow and move along the path? No! 

So my fellow chaotes, let us revel in failure, because at least we fail trying rather than sitting on our backsides reciting some old ritual the exact same way Uncle Al wrote it down in a book that has been gathering dust on the shelf for years. Chaos is about DOING, it is about CHANGE, it is about WHAT MIGHT BE, tapping into the chaos stream and playing with potentiality  (or at least it is for me, who am I to define chaos magick to anyone else!)"

It's nothing like that myspace... or that facebook...or anything else we all pull out of our asses. =o<br /><br />Well,as you all know, I'm not very good at computer things... or getting up to date. because i dont like computers all too much but i will tell you what I really do like to do. I like to sit in samis basement... and listen to sami rap... or hear her talk to me in robot....<br /><br />or i like going to taco bell (a.k.a- place of employment) and hearing sami yell out very.... vile naughty things out the window when it really isnt appropriate. You know. And..... I like to go on long drives leading no where while Sami Nate and James are in the car.&nbsp; And run away from cops for no reason... just because james says to dip. <br /><br />its all fun. because they all make me smile.<br />and make my life a little different from yours. <br /><br /><br />and i love laughing at sami when she makes this gasping for breath sound while shes laughing...<br />which makes me laugh harder because i make her laugh harder...<br /><br />and i like it when she yells at people who dont make any sence.<br />and being with her all the time because she is the only best person for me...<br />always has been.<br />always will be.<br />&lt;3.</div>"

I guess it's fine. I'm doing everything that I know I need to do this year to meet my satifaction, but who knows how long I'll keep that one up. I guess the fact that I hardly have friends around anymore, it helps me focus on the things that really need to get done.&nbsp;<br /><br />I never sleep anymore, which is great. The baby sleeps right under me in the basement and whenever he's up, you can expect that I'm up, just waiting for someone to get up and change, hold, or comfort him. So, basically, I'm just real fuckin tired. I have 8 hours of school this year. My zero hour, my normal 6 hours, and then I took up a seventh hour. My seventh hour isn't anything big but writing everything in my planner seems like soo much.&nbsp;<br /><br />Every single friend that I had over this summer isn't around. The only person I've actually been talking to is Ashlie. I should count my blessings that I have someone around. My parents suck, the only thing I want to do is get out of this house but really I'm not sure where I would go after I left.<br />So.. does anyone want to be my friend... like actually my friend.<br /><br />Sorry I'm so god damn negative this entry around but it's kinda hard when you feel like you've got no one around.<br />Divorces suck.

"event","I don't know if anyone could ever know how one person or the other could possibly feel in a certain moment in time... but I have to ask, has anyone ever felt what it's like to feel like everything you've ever know was just kinda... crumbeling. 
     It's funni because the moment I typed that out, I wasn't thinking about my situation, but in the past week, what about 4 to 5 of my other friends must be feeling about how things are going on in there lives. It seems like this is just a bad last 10 days for a lot of people. I guess in my case, the whole summer has gone on and off a bit sour. 
     I don't expect anyone to read this but I really just feel like typing...
     Well, I guess you never really know how greatful you are to have parents that are together until they decide one fateful day that they can't stand to stay together; they're ""co-exhisting"", if you've ever heard a term so well put. I guess since i've heard the news i've kinda of felt like... what's the use? You know. It's like, how many people do you see happily together anymore. How many people do you know that had what it took to stay in love. Deal with the person you loved so much before, for the rest of their un-natural lives. No one. There is hardly anyone anymore. They all just don't want to deal with it. Their careers, their social life, EVERYTHING ELSE is more important than working on that relationship that you vowed to never leave eachothers sides. It kinda makes you want to lose hope. The little hope that I did have. I mean, I have always thought that I would be the only one out of all of us that would never get married. Never have any kids. You know, until just recently I thought maybe I'd want something like that one day. I realized how quickly I would be whilling to give up some of my dreams to be with someone I could quite possibly love for the rest of my life. I'm not having any epiphanies here, what I'm asking is, is it worth it? Is it worth it to vow yourself to one person for the rest of your life? Is it worth it to fall in love and than after 24 some odd years of marriage one of you decides that you just can't handel it and wants you and your kids to move out by the end of the year?
      To be honest, I really just don't know. If, let's say, within the next five years someone I truly cared about bent down on one knee and asked for my hand in marriage would I say yes? Well it sure as hell would be something to think about wouldn't it! Can you say, well let me sleep on it, I'll get back to you in a few days? I think that might ruin the whole ""moment"" effect he would have been looking for. 
     I don't know. I mean, why should I even worry about that now? I mean, I'm not getting married any time soon. I'm going through a terrible break-up between the only two people I have ever relied on to be constant in my life. Friends have never been a constant thing...school, grades, jobs; all VERY irregular, all whilling to change. I mean, think about it, the one thing you never expect to change is the way you plan on comming home everyday. They've always been there, it was always a together thing and now I feel as if they're kinda...dickin with my whole schedule...my routine. It almost feels babyish to feel terrible over but like I said, it doesn't just bring up one thing, which is divorce, but what will happen to me, what will happen  to both of them, where will all of us go? 
      Who cares right? It's no ones concern really, it's just that I feel like typing and  I guess this is just what's on my mind.

     On a lighter note I suppose. Within the next week I will be an Aunt. Yes me. To a Rylan Paul ZaGara. How exciting right? I think so. I can put my spare energy into him and take my mind off of distant relationships from all three big catergories on my mind. I'll be SUCH a good aunt.
     I guess the boyfriends comming home again too. I mean this is the first time he's gone by the ""10 away four at home"" theory but at least he's comming home. Everytime I mention that I have a long-distance relationship everyone always asks me how I do it and how they could never do it, it'd be ""too hard"". It's almost nice. It keeps me in check you know. It helps me remind myself that I can't let him be all I'm left with because I know I need my friends. With him gone a lot and my friends being around a lot let's me know that they will always be there for me and I need to keep them around as much as possible. Keep the people that are always there, forever there. I know that I am absolutly nothing without my friends. They have all helped shape me in one way or another, and I appriciate that greatly.
     Well I guess this is the best time to just stop, maybe I'll write another netry in another 6 months er so when I actually do get on my computer.

I'm harsh. I will NOT, I REFUSE, to regaurd to YOUR feelings when you don't give a shit about mine. 

Say all you want but I was ALWAYS grateful when I was given things but let it be known that I never expected it. And just because someone GIVES ME something, doesn't mean that I won't gaurd myself when someone says something hurtful to me. 

I have my own life and I will do what I please with it. I will fall for who I fall for, I won't hide it because someone else likes me. That would just be stupid. I'm a GOOD friend. I know I am. Don't hurt me over nothing. Because that is all it is or was; NOTHING. Maybe we all learned a lesson from this, talking to the person before accusing or saying what you think. It should be a face - to - face thing because any other way, someone could take something wrong... or possibly hurt them more.

Who saved me but him, the one that began the cycle of hurt. The only person that can make you stop hurting, is the person that hurt you in the first place. When I look at him is when I fall the hardest. He doesn't have to say anything at all and I know he cares. He makes me forget about the one person that made it hard for me to trust. I still don't trust, I have issues I know, but maybe someday I'll be able to get over that. 

Maybe someday I'll be as happy as I know I can be. Get over this whole thing and just trust him. I feel like I can't do it but I know I can. He goes out of his way for me and I try and help him with what I can. I try to be there. 

I must remember; staying happy is key. As long as he makes me happy, I think everything will be okay.

It's insane how the MOMENT that you stop looking for everything you ever wanted, it all falls right in your lap. It's the truth too, I was so done with everything and I was like ""It's okay, I know I can be okay alone"" and the moment I thought it, and actually believed it, I was just over- whelmed with what was put right there in front of me:finally:happiness

I haven't been THIS happy in such a long time. I still get little butterflies in my stomache and I jump around when I know he's coming to see me. No one else... just me <3. He makes me feel like I'm the most important person in the world. He's becoming really important to me all over again.

But ANYWAYS.... 

Boi Oh Boi, I wouldn't call him a heart-breaker, but something else...hmm, the word escapes me. You'd think that someone who dis-likes themselves so much would hate life as well. Like those two aspects would go hand in hand. I would just like everyone to know that (minus one thing or another) life is going really well for me. I see my friends daily; no matter the hour or the day, I have talked to old enemies and new friends, and I feel great about having almost no enemies. Life looks up at the oddest times. Call it irony but I feel like I've been sent an opportunity underneath all of this madness. I like the thought but if I think about it too deeply I might skwuander(SP?) it all. I'll just look at it from a distance for now. 

There are three girls in my life that I could never ever let go of. I cherish them with every peice of me. Girls: Everything I hold dear belongs to you. (You three know who your are) Thank you for ALWAYS being there no matter how stupid I've been or the situation in hand alone. I love you.

And my story ends like this:
I love everyone that's in my life right now. I like the person I've become because the people that helped form what I am today. You all may not know it, but you make me soo happy, everyday. I'm so thankful.

Can You tell I'm in a lovey mood? 
Huff, off to work from 9 until.... whenever they want to let me go..er.

Oh yes, didn't I tell you; yes I have court. The stupid cunt pulled me over for a rolling stop, who doesn't roll when they stop? All in all, I want a ciggerette, do you have a cigerette, I would love my cigerette. When you turn 18, I turn into a mooch, the older you are the more I'll bug you. Oh yah did I tell you I have stalkers, theyre quite consistent. I'll leave and they'll call and I arrive and they kiss my hand and they bring their babies to me while I work. They don't leave me alone when all the while I just want you to leave me alone. I realize I don't like to be touched unless I want to touch you, so don't touch me unless I touch you. Who knows how or why I've gotten into this rambel mumbo jumbo but I'm lonely right now and the whole world is against me; machine and man. She knows I hate her but she tries to hard. So in reality she should know that she should just leave me be. But she won't stop so the more she talks the more annoyed I get and who likes to get annoyed; not I captain, not I. I want to leave but have no where to go, how can I go? everyones gone? I guess I just don't know. And I'm calling the love of my life to see if she'll come and pick me up; oh look katies coming yay Im not going to be bored any more and ill be able to releave everything yaya.

they dont like her anymore either you can hear it in their tone, and it kinda makes me giggle, and i miss a boy thats impossible for me to hug which is stupid because hes my hubby and blah blah blah.

<P>I think I myself have become a bad omen. I'm outside trying to fix my brakes but the calaper seems to me, is shot..... so I get pissed go inside tell pops what happened and run to my room in dismay. He calls out an hour later and tell me that the thing just came undone... thats why it wont work so i wait out there to see if he can get it....he doesnt, so I go inside...and he gets it! He's got the left side of my car totally ready to go, so I come out saying I got the right side and what happens? The bolt break in my calaper bracket.... so what does nikki think? ""hey lets use an easy out, itll be okay after that"".....nope, that broke in there to. Call me crazy but then i look at both of my right side tires and see that theyre both flat. Some how within the time I haven't driven my car, I ran over a screw??? Or two? so now i need new tires to. I don't think I wana talk about what else happened... hopefully my car will be running tomorrow. </P>

<P>Lets Kill All Signs Of Ageing </P>
<P>- + - + - + - + - + - + -</P>
<P>As the days go by; the older I get, I just wish life would go at some sort of stand still. I wish I could embrace every second, every moment that I ever took for granted. I record all my memories so at any time; when memories are all I seem to hold, all I have to do is press rewind and everything that I experienced, loved and held so dear to me would be there and life suddenly would have its meaning again. Every image in my head comes in all a little bit clearer than when I first layed eyes on it. No matter what I've ever said out of spite, there hasn't been a moment that I've hated life; not a moment that I ever really wanted to die. Have you ever just road down a new road or path you've never taken before and just stopped to marvel at its beauty? It's almost like you're breathing in a whole new type of air; refreshing. How I see it, it's insane to sit and creep inside your own head and make new life realizations and to mature just from looking at things from all ends. I guess I do that a lot. For example, I think that no one can say they really regret doing or saying or hearing or anything; they just regret the timeing. If I wouldn't have heard that right then than I wouldn't have said anything or if she would have just said that any other time than now, it wouldn't have been so bad, or if I would have done that a few months down the road, it wouldn't have hurt so bad. We do or say things because at that particular time, we really wanted to and our impulse took over and we did it or said it anyways even if it ment hurting the ones you love. I think I would forgive almost anyone for making a mistake if they really did hurt over it or was sincerly sorry for whatever they have done or said. Its just the matter of time it would take for me to forgive them. I know I still am immature, but I think I like not knowing everything about anything. To be able to slide off subject or have no clue what you were talking about but acting as though you do any way. Or just taking the simple pleasure of not thinking about the actual consiquence of doing something you thought was fun, because in the end it was worth it anyways. I love this stage of life, where I don't have to do anything and be able to get by in life and have fun while doing so. I like knowing that I can do great things without trying to be the best. Knowing what I need to do and doing it. Not really caring what other people might think about it because it's my standards that I'm living up to, not the standards that someone else is pushing me to live up to; because when you start living by other peoples standards, thats when your fun gets sucked out of anything that you once enjoyed...Wow, life has so many bends and turns that you could sit and try to figure out life for years and not even come close to figuring everything out. I don't really plan on waisting life away to do that either... </P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I've been sooo down lately and I hate it, I'm hateing me!! I'm hearing things I don't want to hear and I'm doing things that I don't want to do. I want to see the things that I see in my head. Life would be perfect for the person who dreamt it up in their head. Even if I rant about these terrible weeks that my bipolar takes over, I don't think I would dream up my perfect world. If everything was perfect, everything would be expected to work out the way you thought, and what excitment would that be? I really don't think much of anything.</P>
<P>I've been restricted from everything now a days. Ever since the night I was picked up (to my own embaressment) by my dad from Sars place that one night (those who were there know exactly what night I'm talking about) my parents have been trying to keep me from going to Sars house. I think they just know if I go there I'll never want to go home; like last summer. I mean it makes perfect sence to me; they've been saying ever since last summer ended that this summer wouldn't be anything like the last, that I had to be home half the summer and not hybernate at Sarahs house. I think they're just pulling some bullshit. How could they possibley try and keep me from going to see one of my best friends?!? What type of parent DOES that sort of thing?? ... A Nikki kind of parent. I think they are stupid fucks. </P>
<P>Tomorrow I'm finally getting my paycheck. That makes me happy because I NEED the money!! I've been driving EVERYWHERE lately and spending sooo much doe on my car. Oh yah , I didn't tell you all,&nbsp; the other day, while putting gas in my tank, i forgot to put my gas cap back on so when i turned the corner it flew in the middle of the road and when i finaly was acknowledged about it, someone brutally drove over it...so now my gas cap just sets on my gas tank instead of screw on.</P>
<P>I've realized that I'm not one of those ""crushing"" sort of people... or ""liking"" sort of person. I mean never-the-less I have crushes and what not, but I just don't enjoy haveing them. Life is soo much better without the complications of what crushes bring.</P>
<P>i need to spend 120$$ on my car... all together... within the 4 1/2 months ive had that car... i have spent about $500 on it. I mean I honestly don't feel like the damned car is worth it but in the long run I guess it is. I mean I had to fix my brake lights and &nbsp;fix ALL of my roders and brake pades. I duno, getting a good car, the car is spose to be good.&nbsp;<FONT size=4>&nbsp; </FONT><FONT size=6>- + - Stupid - + -</FONT></P>
<P>There is SOO much on my mind that I have to think through right now. This sucks soo bad thinking about useless things that get me down. And that's just it; it's USELESS!! I can't do a damn thing about any of them...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I guess I realized that I let my flirting take new hieghts. I mean I feel like shit when a guy that liked me finally moved on. I guess I just liked that security of them liking me and always having someone to flirt with and someone always making me feel so great. I'm a shit head for doing shit like that and thinking that I'm the victim but that's the way I end up feeling. I really do support you if you ever left. If you found that special someone, really I am happy for you. . .</P>
<P><FONT size=4>I think I should just shut my mouth now. . .</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

HAPPY BIRTHDAY REBEKA BOLEMA, I LOVE YOU!!!!!

<P><lj-cut text=""A thought to clear the mind""> </P>
<P>So I guess I'm really pissed off. By around Febuary of next year I'm going to be an Aunt. The ""planned date"" is February 8. I guess I'm happy but to those who know all the shit I've been through with Crystal, you would know why I would be pissed off that I'm never going to see me neice or nephew like...ever. Just a thought on my mind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I missed the show last night... just like I've had to miss a lot of things that I've wanted to go to because of my parents restrictions. Instead of being able to go to my beka's sweet 16&nbsp;I got to drink myself stupid with my cousins. . . . YAY! I duno I didn't have the best time fighting with my parents almost the entire&nbsp;time; If&nbsp;I had&nbsp;to stay there at least allow me to have a&nbsp;decent time; right?? Nope.</P>
<P>PROPS to those who did allow me to have a decent time.</P>
<P>So Beka I'll bring you your present to you soon.. taytay?Maybe at the next girls night that I really hope I'll be able to go to. </P>
<P>Yah, the last girls night there was (with lily) I wasnt aloud to go to. Could you have guessed that one?</P>
<P>I guess nothing really has gotten me in a good mood lately. I've been down and mopeing around like there's nothing to be happy about. I haven't seen any of the girls in about a week now and its kinda bothering me. Some strange misconceptions have been coming out of all our distance and I hate feeling terrible for nothing.</P>
<P>Who knows, I guess I'll see you all on wednesday, right. I really want to see sarah and Janelle right now. Those are the 2 people I just really want to see because they always make me happy no matter how bad I think everything is going to be.&nbsp; mmmm . So I might stop by if you 2 read this before.. yah 5 or something like that. </P>
<P>I&nbsp;hate how ""just one of thsoe days""&nbsp;has turned into ""just one of those weeks"" I feel like Im going to feel like&nbsp;shit for ever and thats just makeing me&nbsp;feel even worse. &nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Honestly you just dont understand how everything is going on. It's not even close to what you think... </P>

but I feel as though I've realized that I really just don't give a fuck
anymore. I only need a few people' and those few people can make me soo
incredabley happy. I love all my friends so god damn much I don't know
if any of them even have a clue as to how much their friendship our
lives our secrets mean to me and when I feel like I have lost that, I
normally feel like shit. Oh Well, really, Isn't that all I can say. <br>
When I've been down and out there's these 3 (just frequently 4) girls
that I have been hangin out with the most that have just brightened my
day from a storm to a real sunny day...PROPS: Sami, Janelley, Sarah,
and Lily<br>
This summer has been just crazy so far. I feel like I haven't lived it
up to its fullest. I've run into many of ass hole within this time...
who would've known just how many dick heads are in one area code.<br>
<br>
- + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + -<br>
<br>
I haven't been to summer Cel once so far. I guess I just feel like I've
come out of that scene, or maybe its because my parents dont think I'm
quite old enough to go downtown with just me and my little girlfriends
(which the majority of the time; there are almost always boys there)
either way, by now I know that I can take care of myself in a big crowd
of people with about 10 of my friends around me protection-wise. Oh
Dear; everytime I leave the house I just shudder in my boots. <br>
<br>
<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Soooo ... </span></span>I really can not wait until next week, If all plans go well, our <span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 204);"">secret - mission</span>; labeled: <span style=""color: rgb(204, 51, 204);"">""</span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 255);"">None of Your Fucking Business</span><span style=""color: rgb(204, 51, 204);"">""</span> is going to be the best week of my life.<br>
But of course, that is if plans go as planned.<br>
I&nbsp; personally can't wait till Beka's <span style=""color: rgb(0, 204, 204);""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">&lt;3</span> Sweet Sixteenth</span> <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">&lt;3</span>;
not only because shes sweet and sixteen but because Ill get to see her.
I miss you mucho and I havent really gotten to talk to her in a long
while and hopefully I'll have that chance at a point in time at her
pizzarty. <br>

I think I want to get away for a while mearly because of the things that I let float around in my head.

Guess what, I think I'm going up shit-creek at work; yay me for speaking my mind. See what it does to you!

Anyways, yes, about getting out of Muskegon... Any one want to go on a road trip with me... or even just as far as GR for all I care. 
Okay I think I'm calling Sami right about now... 
Or in a few hours...when I think she might be up... yah okay.



*Edit*

Oh and I thought I would add how at 6:41 in the fucking A.m. my moms looking for ""my alcohol"" that I really didnt have in the shelves of the garage because she found a bacardi RAZ CAP! in my jeans and I just went out into the garage...; when really i was going to see how many gallons came in those little damn gas cans because i dont have enough gas to get to the gas station and i have no money; fucking cool.
Actually at the moment, Im being questioned.

<P>Even though I feel like I grow and mature from my experiences everyday, the little things let me know that I'm still young. I realize I really don't let anything bother me anymore. It'll bother me for about an hour or so and by morning (or whenever) I'm over it. I realize I'm one of those people that can be figured out but not as easily as others. </P>
<P>It turns out instead of learning more and more about life; like I expect I'm going to do; But I'm learning more and more about myself. </P>
<P>I found that the people around me are simply amazing. I love all of my friends even if some of them don't perticularly love eachother. I love my girls sooo fucking much, I'd be in shambles without them! And Im happy that Im starting to make new friends too; like all the boys that run my sARs house. </P>
<P>So Im really excited about the days to come. I feel like something out of the ordinary is going to happen but hell, I'm all up for ""out-of-the-ordinary"". </P>
<P>My parents are making me get my hair cut again. Im getting it done tomorrow morning, and its just my luck that my hair stylist is staying the night tonite. YAY meeeee!</P>

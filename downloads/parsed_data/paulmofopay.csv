"event","hahahaha life its goin and its comin and for some reason the comuter thinks that its 10:21 when it aint its 1:21 I'll fix that. There we go thats alot better. So what to put in here... my house just got jammed packed with children and more older people. Sitting on my couch with a unlit ciggerette makes you look at life a little diffrent. Its not a bad thing life... shit most of the time i think thats its just crazy... one sec got a text. Ok back... for some reason my ex's mom really wants me to go to lunch with her and I don't know why. Its kinda weird but ok at the same time. I think that she just really wants me to go back out with Kaylee... when I don't know if I really want to. I made out with cat the other day... Were not goin out and I don't think I want to its all weird... everythings weird in its own way. But everything makes sense if you look at it the right way. Little android man... never ever ever trust a little android man... he'll cut cut cut. if you know that song say hey hoe... lol. But yeah no one reads this so it doesn't matter. 

I think some times... about what Katie thinks about she usually tells me alot of things but I don't know if its everything. I would hope that she would tell me everything. I love that girl with all my heart I really do. But some subjects she keeps locked... and my lock picking techniqes have not been mastered yet... and I need to find out what that girl's really thinkin about so I can find out if my intetions have been pure or not. Now that prolly doesn't make alot of sense... but it doesn't really matter. What ever happens happens.

I have a very blan look on the world... in my head everyone is good and gets turned bad... just like that one guy said. And alot of people blame the media for the evil changing... I don't agree with that the media has nothing to do with it. I live in a very conservitive house now and everything is evil if they don't understand it. And thats how it goes... under educated people make a very fucked up world and its the world I live in. But if you take under educated conservitives and add technology it makes a broken peace of crap. And if you add anything really it doesn't work out. Cause there not used to it they don't know enough about it. I could teach my family so much if i could just open there minds a little and let them see the world for what it really is. 

nothing to say on anything, my book is closed."

"event","I'm at kelsey's right now and I'm getting a really weird vibe from two main people here Hillary and Kelsey not like lovey dovey but weird. Really weird. But W/e it comes and goes in all of us as it seems. Maybe it the weather... maybe I should stop blaming it on things and relize that its just life its self.

Well in pp news nowadays I'm now a single man... I don't know if I'm looking I don't really know what I want... I really don't. Well accually I do know what I want and thats a special girl... that I don't think I'll ever have. Her name will be kept secret because the government is after her and wants her dead and if they find out she's in t his town I won't have anyone to long after. 

Me and katie are hanging out thats gonna be cool I guess we'll prolly just talk about her boy and I'll feel like there is nothing I can really do but make her smile... witch I seem to be good at... not like there is anything else that I'm rally good at. With my freinds out side of school I'm the idiot who just does stupid shit and every once in a while I'll say somthing that makes complete sense. But to the people inside of school it seems that i'm that one guy that no matter who you are you can get along with. I'm not as stupid but i still am. IDk whats goin on in my head but alot of shit.

Its the next day and I'm sittin over in my place of residence watchin not another teen movie... this movie is good... I guess. My Aunt lois is on her death bed... and I do feel for the family and how they are reacting but It doesn't seem like I have any feelings. I'm not on the verge of crying or anything... some times I think that I just have no feelings or maybe its just that I have no problem with death... within my family. When Katie B almost died... I cried my eyes out I couldn't take the thought of me not being able to see her again. But when It comes to family members I  have no remorse. I don't know whats wrong with me...

So life goes and comes has its ups and downs I don't really have anything that major to complain about but I am american so I have to find somthin to complain about. School is on the verge of ending and to tell the truth I don't want it to. I don't know if I'll be able to function in the real world... be able to live the life that I've dreamed of. It just seems the older i get the more life doesn't make sense... shouldn't be the other way around. I wish I was 10 again and everything was simple... Peter Pan you are god. No i have to worry about College and jobs... driving situations and other things of the sort. But I don't wanna think I wanna live. maybe thats the reason why I indulge in other peoples lives so I won't have to think about mine at all.

I worry about love before anything else... I worry about myfreinds befor myself.
I don't mind the way live... But for once I want to give.
Give the right peace of mind... and leave this shit all behind.
No matter what I'll be the same... in the end I won't alow my self to change.

How did I just make a poem??? That confuses me so... but w/e I'm headin out."

"event","Wow...it has really been forever since I've written on here!! Last year I was updating this thing a few times a week...I guess I had a lot more to say :oP

I miss Bobby now. That's pretty much what I do. He's in Illinois for his Navy schooling and I'm here...in Green Bay...with nothing to do but wait for him. All of my friends (or the ones that I DID have) are so incredibly SICK of me talking about him and complaining about how much I miss him I'm sure they could just shoot me. But I do. I miss him more than I ever thought I could miss a person. Whenever he isn't here, I feel so incomplete...I know it sounds horribly cheesy and lame, but it's the truth. He is my other half and I'm so blessed to have him in my life...

He and I have made some serious plans lately. We have talked about getting married and moving to his permanent duty station together as husband and wife...wow...it's so awesome to think of myself as his WIFE!! I love the way it sounds...Allison Laughlin...God I'm so immature :oP But I love the man so much!! No matter what happens, I will always love him. Always. I'll always be here waiting for him and I'll be there for him through whatever comes. I'm committed!! He's stuck with me now ;o) Poor guy!! LoL! 

I can't wait to be married and have a house with the man I love so much...but he hasn't proposed yet, so nothing is even close to final!! I'm waiting for that magical proposal ;o) I'm so excited!! I know it's going to be so special...I can't wait to see what he comes up with! But he's a very smart and extremely romantic guy, so I know I won't be disappointed :o) 

I'm almost done with my fourth semester of college...it's been an okay experience I guess. I don't like UWGB at all. I don't know if I'd go back to Oshkosh either though. My plan for the fall is to work until Bobby and I get married and then move to wherever with him and then get my Associate's degree online and then (once I know how long we'll be in one place) I'll go to a technical school for photography. I'm excited!!!! It should be an interesting experience...

Well, that's all for now...hopefully I'll be able to update with some exciting news soon!! :oD"

"event","How often we've stood on dark flight lines and piers...
""I love you,"" ""I'll miss you"" whispered through tears.
During long seperations, in peacetime, at war...
my nights filled with dreams of this man I adore.
With only my memories to hold close at night...
I live for the day God returns my sunlight.
Yes, life goes on when your loved one's at sea...
but the ache never leaves, the fear stays with me.
Dear Lord, I need your guidance, your love...
help me be brave, keep your watch from above.
Hold my dear one so safe in your heart and your hand...
bring him home to his family...this hero...my man.
Of us, Lord, I pray he'll be filled with such pride...
of how we carried on without him by our side.
Please, help time fly quickly and soon I will hold...
the hand of the man whose eyes chase the cold.
Whose voice brings delight, whose touch eases pain.
How will I ever say ""Farewell"" again?
With your help, dear God, I'll try to stay strong...
and pray that his time here at home will be long.
Still, ""I know that the Navy will need him,"" I sigh...
but we'll face it together, Dear Lord, you and I."

"event","I haven't written in a while. Sorry. The urge just hasn't struck me lately. Bobby keeps telling me how stupid and pointless LJ and all that MySpace stuff is. I still kind of like it though. It helps me keep up with everyone :o)

Anyway...stuff has happened since I last wrote...Bobby and I went to the Dells and then to Indiana. LONG story. Don't know if I have time to tell it :o) Some highlights: 

*Hotel was crappy as all hell (but only $70 per night plus a free pair of Noah's Ark tickets for every night you stayed)
*
The Dells is HELLA expensive (spent WAY TOO MUCH THERE!)

*Seeing comedians live is so much better than watching them on TV

*Didn't go to Noah's Ark because it was raining and/or cloudy pretty much the entire time we were there (but we did sell our free tickets and made $60 :o)

*Bobby is the most stubborn person on the face of this earth (besides me!)

*We got lost in Gary, Indiana and it was scary...then we got lost in the ghetto of Chicago...and that was even scarier. 

*Bobby's mom is pretty much the coolest mom ever, besides mine

*Long car trips are...well....long...but they are totally worth it

*Wizard Quest is the coolest

*Uncle Fun's is closed on Mondays. Just so you know.

So yeah. That was the trip and my comments on it in a nutshell. We went to the Dells, came back to GB, picked up Bobby's little brother, drove to Kenosha, stayed with Bobby's aunt and uncle, then drove to Terre Haute, IN the next day and stayed for four days. Then Bobby and I left and went to Chicago, stopped in Gurnee and shopped, and then went home. It was a good time for all, a few bumps in the road, but it's all okay now. Whew. 

I miss my friends from Oshkosh. I am really apprehensive about starting at UWGB this fall. I'm scared that I'm not going to like it as much as I like Oshkosh. Now that I have friends in Oshkosh, I miss it a lot and kind of want to go back. Maybe once Bobby is in the navy I will transfer back to Oshkosh. My friends are getting a house junior year and have promised to put me on the lease :o) LoL But we'll see what happens. 

Gimme a call. I'm lonely."

Lacrosse is so cool!! I can't believe I waited this long to watch my brother play...HE'S AMAZING!! Along with the rest of the Southwest team of course :o) I watched my brother break a school record by getting 6 freaking goals in one game...crazy machine :o) I also saw Issac Sloat make 3 goals...CONGRATULATIONS ISSAC!! The game was amazing to watch and the skills I saw were incredible. All the assists, all the goals, all the violence :o) LoL But really, it was awesome and whoever doesn't go to those games really should cuz they're missing out!! 

The only thing I was disappointed about was the damn defense. They didn't get into the game with their sticks and they didn't hit anyone to jar the ball loose...ARGH!! It was so frustrating to watch them let the red team dance around with the ball...but the offense made up for it well enough. The final score was 12-9, Southwest. YAY! :o)

Anyway...my school year is finally over and I've been home for the summer for three days.

I'M SO BORED.

I no longer have my best friends living down the hall from me, so when I'm bored I can't just run down there and visit them. Summer is expensive too!! All the gas I'm going to have to buy...it makes me want to cry just thinking about it. Argh. 

I have to go and feed the dog because my sister is too lazy. I'll be back."

"event","Bobby and I have been dating for more than a year now. It seems like it hasn't even been that long, but around this time last year we were swept up in a love that no one would have ever expected...and I still love him dearly and wouldn't trade him for the world!! He came to visit me this last weekend and it was so nice to be able to have him hold me again :o) We partied a little and I got a lot drunk on Friday night...it was a good time to be had by all however :o) My friends were glad to finally meet him and have him party with us. I think they were just stoked to see ME go out!! I never did just because Bobby didn't want me to, but a couple weeks ago he gave me the go-ahead to drink with my friends. It was a lot of fun, and I'm glad we got to experience that together :o) I LOVE HIM SO!!!

Speaking of Bobby, we are planning an awesome vacation for just the two of us to the Dells in June. We are staying in a hotel that gives out free pairs of tickets for Noah's Ark, so we'll be doing that, plus going to all those silly ""tourist trap"" type thingys. There are haunted houses and fun houses and museums and places to feed deer and interactive places...IT WILL BE SO FUN!! I'm totally pumped!!

On a little bit more of a mellow note, I was just reading through all the entries that I wrote last year, and it seems like it was just yesterday that I was graduating fom high school, waiting behind the curtain for my name to be called, walking across the stage and shaking the principal's hand, recieving my diploma. It's so crazy to think that in three days, my first year of college will be over. 

I have decided to come to UWGB next year. I'm still a little torn about it just because I will miss my friends here so damn much. I never knew how easy it would be to make friends here!! I love them all to death...and I promise that I will bring my car up for weekends to come and visit and PARTY!!! LoL!!

I really should be writing my TBIS final paper right now (its supposed to be 6 pages...I have about one!! LoL) and I didn't turn in a rough draft yesterday like I was supposed to. Ooops. That means that the best grade that I can get on the paper is a B, which wouldn't be all that disappointing although I am currently getting an A in the class. The final paper is worth 20% of our grade, and that may mean that I'll either get a B or possibly an AB in the class. Oh well. I seriously just lack the motivation right about now. I should also be studying for the Geology final I have tomorrow and the History final I have on Friday. Hmm...maybe later :o)

Yesterday my roomie and I were talking about procrastination and how we have become pros at it...I mean, why get it done early when you can do it the night before and get a pretty decent grade on it?? That's a bad thing to think, but I do it anway :oP

This weekend I get to babysit the demon Chilcote children and make a couple hundred dollars. That will be nice because then I can just use that money for the trip and use my paychecks from work to save for school and whatever else. Yay :o)

I miss everyone in Geebs...I'm excited for summer so I can see everyone again!! WHOOHOO!!"

"event","So...Bobby might be going into the Navy. He has a meeting with a recruiter for the Marines tomorrow, but the Marines are CRAZY and he would rather be in the Navy. I'm so scared. I don't really know what I'm scared of exactly, but I am nonetheless. I guess it's because I'll be away from him, but that's a dumb reason. Or so I'm told. This changes everything that we had planned if he does it (which he probably will). I guess it's silly to start planning your life with someone when you are as young as I am. I dunno.

I thought about it, and it really would be very good for him...all the discipline and stuff. All the money is nice too, and it's pretty much the only reason that he wants to join the military at all. He said he wants to have a stable future and be able to provide for me. Aww :o) I love the boy to death, and from what my friends who have boyfriends/fiancees in the military have told me, it doesn't sound like a picnic. I want whatever is best for him, and what is best for us I guess. I will have to be without him a lot, but it will only last a few years. 

Oh wow. A few years.

"event","Spring break was - how shall I say - not nearly as awesome as I thought it would be. The first few days were good!! In fact, I think they were wonderful. I got to see good friends in a play that was hilarious!! I loved every minute of it! Even Mike, although he wouldn't talk to me to save his life. I'm sad that I didn't get to see Cassie and Liz and the other cast. I'm SO SORRY guys!! I'm sure you were beyond fabulous! 

After I watched the play, I started to get sick. Really sick. As in sleep all day and not do a damn thing sick. It was the worst. I had a fever and a wicked cough and a headache and goodness knows what else. I had to go to work all four days that I was feeling the more horrible, and I was moving really slow and just not feeling good at all. That meant that I left early a few of those days, so I'm not getting as much money as I thought I would be. I guess that's okay cuz I'm doing my taxes tomorrow with my mom (FINALLY)so I should get that money back in a few weeks and that will be another hundred or so. 

I talked to an advisor from GB today about classes and scheduling and everything. She showed me the classes that I need to take to become a photographer and I couldn't be more excited!!! I'm so pumped to come back. I don't know how long that feeling will last, but I like the school and hopefully I'll get a good education, which of course is the entire point. 

Bobby and I started talking about moving in together. We talked about doing it as early as next spring. I almost feel like I'm still too young. I can't even believe that some of my friends are engaged!! I feel way too young to be tied down in marriage...I'm not sure why I say ""tied down"" because I kind of already am, but marriage is a whole different kind of rope!!!! I dunno. I like being committed, don't get me wrong, but marriage...that's for life. I don't want to make any mistakes! So, hopefully moving in together will determine the path Bobby and I take in the future :o)

I'm thinking about going bowling tonight...any takers???

I just hope Bobby likes it :oP It's a lot shorter than it was previously, only because I think the hairdresser forgot to take into account the fact that as hair curls, it gets shorter. So technically she did cut it to my shoulders and a little below, which is what I wanted, but when it's curly it gets about an inch shorter. Oh well. It's cute anyway :o)

I'm going home tomorrow! I'm so excited! I'm going to try to get my homework done today so I can relax this weekend. Last weekend I was scrambling the whole weekend to find time to get it all done before Monday. It was frantic and not fun. So I decided that I wouldn't do that anymore. I like the library a lot though. I might have to start going to the one here at school a little more often to do my work. It helps me concentrate.

Not going anywhere warm, not getting a tan of any kind, not drinking til I drop in Mexico, not anything at all...except getting my haircut. And maybe the dentist. Yippee. 

I finally have five minutes to sit here and think about something other than school work. It's all so tedious and awful...I hope real life (as in life after college) isn't all like this. Everyone always tells you how hard life is going to be and how much it sucks and everything...makes you wonder what there is to really look forward to. I mean, why even bother? If life is going to be THAT difficult, then what is the point? My dad and grandpa are always telling me how hard ""real"" life is...have I been living ""fake"" life up until now? They tell you that you are going to have to work really hard and that ""life isn't all fun and games""...I hope there is at least a little bit of fun and maybe some games after this, or I may just go completely insane.

Anyway, I'm done being a pessimist now :o) I am working on a paper for Genocide that is pretty interesting. It is about the Holocaust and the mass muderings of the European Jews. It has always been a facinating topic to me, the Holocaust. I always wondered why people would ever do such horrible things to each other. We are learning about the background of genocide and why people do it. It is very interesting.
How utterly random, eh? ;o)

This past weekend I came home to babysit and I made a pretty penny. I babysat for all of Friday night, left on Saturday to see Bobby for a few hours, brought him with me to watch the two little girls in a concert, then left again for a few hours, then we both came back and sat for the kids from about 4pm to the next morning. We slept in the living room, I on the sofa and he on the floor. I felt so bad for him!! I love that boy so...he was so good with the kids, even though they are little demons and he really despises them. He just has a way with kids. They love him! It's so cute to watch him :o) He helped me out so much...I LOVE THAT BOY! 

Anyway, I should get back to writing my paper. I'm coming home again this weekend, so other than writing my paper I should be free. If anyone wants to hang out, give me a call! I'll be home from Friday about 4pm til Sunday around 8pm. YAY!

I have spent almost $50 today on eBay of all things. I really need to stop! I can't go to that site anymore. It's bad for my wallet. 

I missed my journalism class this morning. I slept through it. Oops. Good thing there are over a hundred people in the class. Even if I missed a quiz (which is doubtful since it was only the third class) she drops the lowest score, so I'm golden. I shouldn't skip it anymore though. 

I also dropped a class yesterday. Bad, I know, but it was a 300 level class!! It was hard hard hard. Usually people don't take 300 level until the second semester of their sophomore year or the beginning of their junior year. I would have had to write a 10 PAGE research paper! Plus it wasn't about what I thought it was going to be about. Very misleading title. It was about Native American women, but it wasn't historical like I thought it was going to be. It was less about culture and more about stereotypes we place on Native Americans in the present. I was disappointed. So I dropped it. Now I only have a total of 26 credits for my entire freshman year. It will keep me in freshman status for another semester, but even if I hadn't dropped this class that would have happened (I would only have 29...you need 30 to be considered in sophomore standing). Oh well. I can always take summer classes.

Then he said that he would call me after the SuperBowl was over. It was over two hours and forty-five minutes ago. I just want him to call when he says he will. Is that so much to ask? He has gotten into that horrid habit lately of not calling when he says he will. I dunno. Am I being too bossy here? Am I in the wrong to expect a call from him? Argh.

Today was poopy. I was supposed to come back to school AFTER the SuperBowl. That's what Chad said on Friday when Bobby asked him about giving me a ride. THEN today all of a sudden, he didn't even call me, he called BOBBY. Chad told BOBBY that he was going to take me home at NOON instead of after the SuperBowl. I was SO INCREDIBLY PISSED OFF. I mean, I'm grateful that he's giving me a ride, don't get me wrong, but he had a committment to me, and he broke it. I asked him why he was taking me back early and he said it was because he and Mollie (his girlfriend) had plans that night. 

YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE THEM BEFORE YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD GIVE ME A RIDE POOPYHEAD.

I had plans too. I was going to help my little sister practice her song for her musical audition and I was going to take her to the Wildlife Sanctuary. I was going to watch the SuperBowl with Bobby and get to spend some time with him before I had to come back. Thanks so much for considering how rude it would be to yank the rug out from under me. I appreciate that. 

I'm done now. 

I had to read a book for TBIS (English) and it is so boring that I want to cry. I had to read the entire 200 page novel in one week, which would be completely do-able if the book was good. LoL! I guess it's interesting in a historical point of view, but I never really enjoyed reading non-fiction and I really don't like reading about space and astronauts. The Mercury 13. Don't ever read it if you don't have to. 

I am tired. I don't know why...I got over 15 hours of sleep yesterday!! LoL I still can't believe that I did that...I feel so silly.

I want school to be over. I need money. I miss Bobby. I want Bobby to call me. 

I'm such a whiner lately :oP I can't stand it...I need to stop!!

"event","I feel so weird. I fell asleep at 5:30 while I was doing my homework and I woke up and it was 12:30 in the morning. My sleep schedule is going to be all fucked up. That's what I get for doing my homework on my bed...

I am home for the weekend. I feel awful for being here, which is strange because I practically begged. I think the fact that I had to beg is what makes me feel the worst. My mom and dad wanted me to stay at school for a while, focus on homework and then come home. I told my mom that I simply HAD to have my snow boots for school because it was snowing in Oshkosh like a mo-fo, but I know that isn't the real reason because I'll never wear them. I wanted to come home because I miss him already. They knew it too. They knew that he was the real reason. I want to be with him all the time. Is that healthy? Is it a good thing that I can barely go to school for a week without missing him so much that I cry myself to sleep at night? 

We almost spend too much time together. Every minute that I was home for break we were together. I was at my house for two, maybe three nights. I feel horrible because my parents and my brother and sister love me too, and they deserve some of my time. Don't get me wrong, I love being with him and I could have said no. Maybe I just suck at saying no and I have no way to stand up to him and tell him what I want. I hate that I have to say it like that - ""stand up to him"" - but in a way I almost feel like I have to do just that. He has powers of persuasion that are almost superhuman. I don't even know how he does it to me every time. I feel so lame. Argh.

I love him so much. I really do. I really do believe that we will be together forever. He is always reminding me of how much he loves me. And he really does things to prove it. If he had more money he would probably never stop reminding me. My parents are bitter because they think he MAKES me pay for everything. I almost always volunteer to pay because I know that it won't be like this forever, at least it better not be. He won't always be a struggling college student. I know that, and I'm willing to support him all the way. Not necessarily financially, but certainly emotionally. 

You know...I'm not even really sure what I'm ranting about anymore. Bobby, or my parents. Maybe I'm just the one stuck in a rut without any resolve. I don't know what's really wrong with me.

Argh."

As weird as it sounds, I'm actually starting to look forward to going back to school in a week and a half. 6 weeks is a long time to sit around doing nothing half the time. I miss my friends and my room and the freedom. *Sigh* I love being here with Bob-a-licious, but I need to put the structure back in my day! I'm becoming my mother...all the organization and scheduling and everything...I just wish I had her patience. That's one thing I'd like to work on for this new year.

Bobby and I are going to Indiana tomorrow to visit his mom and grandma. I have never met his grandma, but from what I hear she's quite the firecracker. I'm interested to meet her and to see his mom again. His mom got me a gift for graduation AND a Christmas gift, and I never called her to say thank you, so I decided that I would give her the greatest hits of Prince, one of her favorite artists. I also got her a nice card. I hope she likes it...I feel bad for not saying thank you, so I hope this makes up for it a little bit!!

I have to be at work at 4pm. I only have to work two days next week, unfortunately. I could really really use the money. My impulse spending has become somewhat ridiculous. Its like I can't even help myself. Every time I go to Wal-Mart I spend money on something I don't need in the slightest...I wish I had more money!!  But then again, who doesn't? 

Must go get ready :o)"

"event","My break has been placidly uneventful. 

My grandma from Michigan is here and has been since about a week and a half ago. She and I hang out while my parents are at work :o) She's such a cool lady...best cook EVER. This is her first Christmas without my grandpa (he died in January of this year) so we invited her to spend it with us so that she wouldn't be lonely, plus it's been a while since we've had her here. It's been great spending time with her...I love holidays with relatives !!

My Christmas was wonderful, probably the best one I've had in a while. I got a Palm Pilot from my parents, about $200 in assorted money from relatives, $30 in iTunes giftcards from my aunt, scrapbooking stuff from my mom (I'm now addicted to scrapbooking!!!) and I also got a nail kit from my brother and a $25 giftcard to Barnes and Noble from my sister. I also got to go to the PACKER GAME!! My mom and dad surprised everyone, INCLUDING Bobby (!!), with tickets. You should have seen Bobby's face when he opened his tickets...it was priceless :o) 

Speak of the devil, I think my favorite present had to be the one from Bobby. It was one of a few, including Aladdin on DVD (he knows me so well :o) and a white Brett Favre jersey. He gave me a diamond promise ring. But that wasn't the best part. Before he gave it to me, he insisted that we go somewhere. I asked where, and he asked me if the Botanical Gardens was open. We checked, and it wasn't. Pamprin Park was though. So, we went there. He walked me over to this little enclosed area on the playground and made me close my eyes. By this point I was laughing and I was actually really nervous. I had no idea what he was doing!! LoL It was a bit weird, but it was SO romantic!! Then, he read me a this beautiful poem he had written for me...it was so beautiful!! It made me cry of course, and then he told me to open my eyes. It was a ring, and right away he said that it was just a promise ring. LoL Apparently he thought that it might appear that he was proposing ;o) It was so awesome...we stood in this little enclosure and hugged and kissed and it was just the most romantic thing ever!! Unfortuntely the ring was a little bit too big, so it's being resized right now and I can't get it back until the 7th... :o( 

Which brings me to another point of interest...originally I was going to go back to school on the second for interim, which is a three week class worth three credits that you do during break. Well, I decided that $110 was too much to pay for books for one class, so I dropped it. That means that I am on break until the 30th of January. I'm so excited!! I get to work for another whole month, which means that I can work less at that detestable Oshkosh Family Video. I called them the other day to tell them that I wouldn't be back for interim, and they haven't called back. I hope they aren't too mad! Oh well I guess...

Well, I am currently in the process of dying my hair and it should be almost done marinating now, so i should go :o)"

"event","Not meant to offend, but I am SO FUCKING PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW!

So here's the scoop: I was supposed to work this weekend because I forgot to take off for the weekend (my bad) but I called people THE DAY the schedule came out and got people to cover all of my weekend shifts. Yay, right? Wrong. 

Last week, apparently Aubrey (the girl that was taking my Friday shift) left me a message and said that she could no longer work for me because she had her uncle's surprise birthday party that day. SURPRISE!!! 

And, in case I forgot to mention, my cell phone is indeed broken and I didn't know about her little birthday party. I called work today (Aubrey and I switched and I was supposed to work for her tonight) to see if I could get a ride and they said that I wasn't even working. HUH?? So I was like, who is working then? They said Aubrey. I said FUCK!!! So I call Aubrey and she's like...""well I left you a message...blah blah blah...and I can't work for you anymore"" TWO FUCKING DAYS BEFORE I HAVE TO WORK!! So that was really cool. So, for the last hour and a half I have been scrambling around trying to find someone to work for me on Friday.

Oh, AND as if that weren't enough, Aubrey switched the schedule back to the original one (with her working today and me working Friday) without telling me. HELLO???? You cannot just up and switch my schedule like that WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST~!!!!! Damn. How very rude. So I'm thinking of telling her to suck it up and that it's her shift now and SHE can find someone to work for HER. Geeze. 

I'm supposed to go home this weekend for two very important reasons. Number one, I have a drama project due next tuesday that I have to edit on my dad's computer over the weekend so we actually have something to present, and number two, my honey is turning the big 1-9 on Saturday, and I have to be there for that. I'm so afraid that I'll have to work on Friday and he will be so mad at me and disappointed in me and that he will hate me. Argh. I hate Family Video. 

I'll tell you why.

When I was first trying to get a job there (and this should have been a HUGE hint to what was to come) Greg, the district manager in Green Bay, was supposed to interview me. I had laryngitis. I felt like absolute shit. I went anyway. They told me that he wasn't going to show up because he was sick. Okay. Fine. I came back a second time and he was there, but he said that he still felt sick, so he wasn't going to interview me that day either. Now I'm a little ticked off. Finally I get interviewed and obviously I got the job. 

Everything was good for a while, and then I had my 30 day review. I was supposed to get a 25 cent raise. Greg told me TO MY FACE that I would get the raise. Paycheck came. No raise. Not one penny. I waited, figuring he just hadn't put it in yet. Next paycheck. Still no raise. I was a little pissed. So I told my store manager Holly about it and she said that she would talk to Greg about it. About two weeks (and yet another raiseless-paycheck) later, Holly took me aside after a meeting and told me that she talked to Greg and he had pulled my raise. Well duh. Thanks for telling ME ABOUT IT!!! THAT WAS SO VERY KIND OF YOU YOU COCK SUCKER! And do you know why he took it from me???? DO YOU KNOW WHY???? BECAUSE I FORGOT TO COVER UP MY NOSE RING, WHICH IS THE SIZE OF A FRICKING PIN HEAD AND YOU COULDN'T SEE IT UNLESS YOU WERE LOOKING FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I cannot even describe to you how angry I was. Pulling the raise? Fine, if you have a damn good reason AND if you TELL ME when you actually DO IT! Pulling my raise because of a tiny nose piercing and then not telling me for a good two months? That, ladies and gentlemen is the work of a real bastard. 

So then things were good, and then they got worse again. I was working at Fam Vid one day, and Holly told me she wanted to talk. Okay. So we go into the back and we talk. She says that if I ever wear my nose ring to work again, they are going to fire me. That's right. They are going to FIRE me if I wear that devil-worshiper's piercing in my nose ever again. 

Wow. Talk about anal.

And now this. Poopy heads. 

GOD.

I just need to go somewhere and scream really loud now."

"event","This weekend was a barrel of laughs. 

I went home, which was freakin awesome. Then I got to babysit the three brattiest kids on the face of planet earth on Saturday, although they weren't as bad as normal because they had an array of health problems (broken ankles, epilepsy, etc.) and I got $70 out of it, so it was okay. I also got to go to Toys R Us and Dairy Queen. I took the kids there just for something to do (because they weren't allowed to go outside and play...AHHHHH!!!). It was good...they are actually really good in public places. While I was making dinner for the kids that night, I started feeling like crap. Absolute crap. So I was a little cranky and really tired. We ate, got Bobby from work, and then watched Homeward Bound on their HUGE TV. Then the grandparents came home around 9pm and I got to leave SUPER early. YAY!

When I got up on Sunday, I felt like SHIIIIT. I was so tired and when I stood up, I wanted to sit back down because I got really light headed and I had one helluva headache and I just was not a happy camper. I took some medicine, and then my dad asked to look at my throat (because my throat was really really swollen, and so I sounded like a cartoon character) and then he told my mom to take me to the doctor right away. So I went to Aurora Urgent Care (it was Sunday) and found out I had strep. So I opted to get the shot of penicillin instead of the oral meds. IT HURT SO MUCH!! They give it to you in your BUTT and the medicine is super thick, kind of like GLUE. It's an intramuscular shot, so all the medicine made a pocket in my muscles and gave me a huge bruise on the inside of my hip.

It gets better.

After they give you any kind of injection, they hold you in the room for 20 minutes to make sure you don't have any negitive repercussions. I started to feel very strange after about ten minutes, like I was going to throw up. I got on the floor next to the garbage can, told my mom that I needed a hair tie, and proceeded to fall down on the floor, out cold. 

My mom ran into the hallway screaming for help, and about 6 people came running in. The next thing I remember, those six people were lifting me onto a hospital bed and wheeling me into the emergency room. They stuck me with an IV and heart monitors and blood pressure monitors and all that stuff. I was pretty much unconscious through all of it. I remember the IV really hurting though. Then they pumped me with a liter of fluid. Whew. It was a long day. 

All in all, the weekend was fun though. I got to hang out with Bobby, which is awesome because apparently he will not be coming with my family to my grandma's from Thanksgiving due to having to WORK. Damn that stupid mall and that stupid manager and that stupid store. I hate it. I think I already ranted about that however, so I'll leave it at that. The point I was making was that I won't get to see Bobby until his birthday (December 3rd). Blah.

I have to give a speech about smoking on Thursday. I hope it's good :o) 

I love you...

Allison"

"event","I just had my entire Thanksgiving weekend brutally crushed. 

Bobby was supposed to come with my family and I to my grandma's house to celebrate Thanksgiving together. He was supposed to keep me company on the car on the 8 hour car ride and be my pillow and keep me from going insane. He was supposed to watch football with me on Thanksgiving and he was supposed to be there for five whole days...it was supposed to be the weekend that I've been looking forward to for two months.

But not anymore. 

Bobby has to work. At Lids. In the mall. I'm so angry and sad and upset right now that I could just call up that manager and bitch her out and tell her to go to hell...but that wouldn't be very nice. Plus it would probably get Bobby into trouble. I called my mom after I found out that he wasn't coming (and after I cried to him on the phone...but he wasn't very understanding) and I cried to her about it. She told me that the first year that she and my dad were out of high school, he wasn't home for Christmas because he was in the Navy. She did what she is so very good at and comforted me and told me that everything would be all right. I don't believe her right now. 

I know it seems like I' blowing this out of proportion, but I have been looking forward to this trip for months, and all of a sudden I've been so terribly disappointed...it hurts more than words can say. I know I'll get over it eventually, but for right now, I'm going to go and wallow in my misery."

"event","Ahh. Sliding back into routine. How I dislike routine. 

I had a wonderful weekend. Bobby and I went to Milwaukee on Saturday, went to a haunted house, and spent the night with Ashley Winters and Matt Olson in Matt's dorm. I tell you what, his entire floor smelled like someone had vomited pizza. It was absolutely disgusting. I felt sick everytime I walked out of the room or off the elevator. Eww. On the other hand, the haunted house was fun and I saw Ben Klenke, AJ Lewis, and got a tour of the school. It was fun. 

My mom and my sister and I also went to see ""Elizabethtown"" on Sunday. It was a weird movie...very random. It had Orlando Bloom in it however, so all was right with the world. Kirsten Dunst is also one of my favorite actresses, and I liked her and Orlando together. Very cute. The music was incredible, and I think I need to go out and invest in the soundtrack rather soon. Good stuff. 

My mother went shopping with me after the movie and I'm lucky I could fit all the groceries that we bought in this room, because we went CRAZY!!! I won't be hungry for weeks :o) She made me broccoli salad (!!!), packed me HOMEMADE barbeque chicken, HOMEMADE chicken soup, and this amazing HOMEMADE (surprise surprise!!) caramel apple salad. INCREDIBLE. My mother is THE most amazing cook on the face of this planet, I swear to God. I love going home because the food is actual food. MMM...REAL FOOD!! LoL 

On a different note, I miss my Bobby already. We had a great weekend together...then again, any weekend that I get to see his handsome face is a good one :o) This long distance thing is killing me...but it could always be worse. I'm actually quite lucky, because I get to see him quite often compared to the amount of time that goes by before some of my friends get to see their boyfriends (Emily and Katie for example). I feel so blessed everyday because he loves me. He calls, even when I don't ask him to, he brings me roses, cuddles with me, talks about forever with me...I love him so much, and I just hope he knows that no matter what happens or how I act, deep down I always always love him. 

I hope everyone else had a decent weekend as well :o) On to gym class. Whoopee.

I tried to finish my speech paper today, I really did. I just couldn't find the motivation. I know that I'm going home in less than two days and I can't concentrate on anything else!! I had my Drama midterm today and all I kept seeing was Bobby's face. AAHHHH! I need to see that boy...soon!! I miss him like crazy...I can't wait to spend most of my weekend with him :o) YAY!

I just turned in my online application to GB...I was stuck on the conclusion of my essay for the longest time, but I just got a sudden burst of inspiration (at 12:30 at night of course...) and I somehow finished it. I also found out that as a transferring student from another UW college, I don't have to pay the ridiculous $35 admissions fee!! YIPPEE!!! That's exciting :o)

I got paid today...and it was FINALLY automatic!! I was supposed to get direct deposit about 5 months ago when I started working at Family Video, and this is the first paycheck that it has actually worked for. Yay for technology :oP 

I've been sick for the last few days...nothing serious, but consistant and noticable enough to be a pain in the ass. I hope it goes away before this weekend!! 

I love my Bobby :o) I can't wait to see you baby!!!

Love, Allison

Plus, I'm always hungry, but when I eat, it makes me sicker!! LoL I just don't understand it :oP  My body is weird!!

Anyway, I found out that I am getting a 4.o for the first time EVER in my LIFE. I've only kept a 4.o for about the first week or two of school. But folks, we're two months in now and I still have all A's!! It makes me so happy and proud. I told my daddy about it yesterday and I don't think I've ever heard him so proud of me. YAY!! :o) Hopefully I can keep it up...maybe I could even graduate with honors!! Wonder of wonders...its a long way off, but still an attainable goal!! 

I have speech in 25 minutes. I think I might throw up. Wish me luck.

In other news, I am feeling very productive today. This is strange because for the last few days, I haven't had any speech homework except to actually practice my speech (ie. no chapters to read) and so I feel like I haven't been doing anything. <LoL> SOO...I took all my syllabi and wrote all the important stuff (like due dates and quizzes and exams...) from now until the end of the semester. YAY!! I even color-coded it :o) It makes me happy. 

I also got visited by my mom, my grandma, my dad, and my sister over the weekend. We went shopping and ate out at Outback Steakhouse for suppa (yucky...). We talked about me going to GB next year and living in the apartment-style dorms instead of the regular dorm rooms. The apartment-style rooms have a full private kitchen, a living room, private bedrooms, and a private BATHROOM!! YESSS!! No more sharing with 40 other girls...and my own shower!! WOOOOOT! So that's very exciting as well. :o) 

My dad was being a butthead though...I wanted to come home this next weekend and Halloween weekend, and he said that he isn't giving me a ride. Boo. So now I'm looking for rides to GB. If anyone can help, I would be willing to pay TOP DOLLA for gas!!! :o) Thanks!!

I have to go and see MacBeth on Friday. Bobby's coming, which will make it easier to understand (he's so smart :o) but I think I should still read through the summary on SparkNotes so I'm not TOTALLY lost...I hope you guys and gals have a fun night!!

Anyway...I haven't updated in a while and figured I should. I have fallen in love with my iTunes. I download new songs all the time. I feel like it's all I spend my money on :oP Everytime I go on it's like I find another song that I just LOVE and MUST HAVE. I found this song the other day: ""Turkish Delight"" by the David Chowder*Band. It's a really interesting song...it has a lot of sensual sounding guitar and drums in it. It's like a samba or a salsa or something...it's really cool :o) You should listen to it sometime.

I have been having THE strangest dreams lately...I don't know what it is about college, but since I've been here I've had some awfully odd dreams. Such as last night, when I dreamt I was driving around in the desert at night looking for some place that you could pay to look at the stars (?!?!) and then I had one that I was on this ride that was Batman themed, only it was like a moving walkway and it had tons of WEIRD stuff in it...I dunno. LoL Maybe I should lay off the drugs ;o) Just kidding.

Nothing of interest has happened lately. I watched ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" yesterday (thank you Family Video :o) I worked yesterday and I will again at 6pm today. My mom and grandma are coming to visit me tomorrow. We are going shopping in Appleton and then out to dinner, although I'm not sure where yet. My sister got a new email address and I wrote her a nice email. I've suprisingly been super nice to my sister since I left for college, and the last time I saw her, I almost cried (??). If you know my sister and I, you know how weird that is, sadly enough. I love my sister, but she is a little annoying sometimes. I told her that we would have to hang out when I get home. I miss her :o( I feel like I'm missing her growing up. That makes me a little sad, but I will do my best to be there for her all that I can. 

Anyway, I better stop being all sappy :o) I have to do some reading for drama and start on my speech (EEEEKK) before I go to work, so I'm sure I'll update again. Someday :oP 

Much Love to All."

"event","I've been sooo busy. It's ridiculous. The amount of reading for speech has gotten smaller, but it's still pretty bad. I have to read three chapters for Tuesday and write a paper (although I finished the actual paper yesterday, I still have to write a reference page and write ANOTHER paper for Drama...). I think the chapters are about 15 to 20 pages each, so it should only take a few hours. 

In other news, I came home last night for the first time in THREE WEEKS and it was so nice :o) I never realized that I would miss home so much. I think it was mostly that I missed Bobby. We left for home around 7pm and we got there around 8. Almost immediately I got the keys for my car and drove it for the first time in three weeks. It felt so AWESOME to not have to walk!! I went to Fam Vid, where I saw Holly, Amanda and Ashley. They weren't as excited to see me as I was to see them I don't think, but it was nice to see them :o)

After Fam Vid, I went to Bobby's work, only because I couldn't go another minute without seeing him. I parked in the back of the gas station and I went in while he was cleaning the bathrooms. I went to the front counter and waited. When I saw him come around the corner, I just lost it. I ran to him and I hugged him for about 10 minutes. I was crying and telling him how much I missed him and I just wanted to stay in his arms forever. I felt like a fool for crying, but I was so happy and excited to see him that I couldn't control myself. I never imagined that I would miss one person SOOOO badly. I just wanted him to hold me for the rest of the night.

For the rest of his shift I sat at a little side counter and did TONS of scratchcards. I think I bought like, $10 worth and I didn't win a single penny. Oh well :o) Bobby put on some music and we decided to change ""our song"". It WAS ""The Luckiest"" by Ben Folds, but we determined that the song ""I'll Be"" by Edwin McCain fit us a lot better. I LOVE that song. The saxophone is gorgeous!!!

I feel like last night was a dream in a way. My visit was a little less than 12 hours, and almost all of it was spent with Bobby. I can't wait until next weekend when I get to stay for the ENTIRE weekend. That will be really nice :o) I also get to see Kelli's baby, Michael, while I'm home and give her all the gifts I bought for him. I'm so interested to see what he looks like...I'll bet that he's freakin adorable :o) So I'm excited for that. 

My family came to see me today. We had breakfast and then we toured Taylor, which was FRIGGIN awesome...I would totally want to live there if I was going to Oshkosh next year :o) We then proceeded to Titan Sports Stadium where there was a bunch pf fun stuff going on. We left there and checked out a PIRATE exibit at the local museum. It was SO AWESOME!!! I got to dress up like a pirate and load a pirate cannon. It was the shiznit :o) 

I am now sitting in my room trying to motivate myself to do my remaining homework and I'm also talking to Bobby on the phone. My mom brought me some Jelly Bellies (my FAVORITE junk food in the ENTIRE world :o) so I ate some of those and read my Teen Vogue magazine. I've been watching bad daytime TV for about 2 hours, I tried to take a nap, and I resorted to LiveJournal :o) I'm really sad. But it's okay. 

I love my Bobby, and I CAN'T WAIT TO BE HOME AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sooner or Later,
Allison"

This is today's ""To Do"" List:

1. Read chapters 6-9 in my speech book AND take nots (Chapter 7 was 28 pages in the book and 7 pages of my notes...EEK!)
2. Write a response to a gym test stating what I learned from taking the test. Yay.
3. Write an outline for a paper due next week - I know, but I want to get at least part of it out of the way...
4. I have to read Chapter 5 for speech (I read and took notes on the WRONG CHAPTER...lol)
5. Review some Geography questions
6. Get my lab manual and actually do the lab assignment so I'll have some idea about what we're doing :oP 

Then I have to go to work at 6pm. 

Wake me when it's over.

I miss everything in Green Bay a lot. A lot more than I thought I would. I have called Bobby crying a few times now, and I've only been gone for a week and a half. I'm so pathetic. I was always excited to leave and start my own life and everything...and now that I'm living that dream, it sucks more and more. I miss my mom and Bobby so bad...I miss my own bed and all my friends. I miss my job and the people that I work with...I MISS MY CAR. I miss everything about GB...so much that I'm thinking about transferring to UWGB next year. That way I can live at home (no housing or meal plan costs) and I can keep my job. The only downsides that I can see are that I would again be paying out the asshole for gas every week (because I would be commuting all the way to GB everyday) and I still wouldn't get to see Bobby as much (because he will also be going to school PLUS working full time). Besides that, my parents rules would still apply to me and I would be living the restricted life once again. I dunno. I have to weigh my options I guess. 

College is okay. A lot more reading has been done than I ever thought was possible. I have never in my life read 150 pages of textbook in one week...until now. I did that last week. Plus took notes on most of it. Argh.

Besides the classes, the college life is good. I love my new friends (Katie, Julie, Krissy, and Allison, to name a few) and everyone in the dorms is super nice. The doors are always open, and there is a lot of camaraderie between all the girls on my floor. Everyone is nice to everyone else and we hang out a lot. Every Thursday we have The OC in the basement, and every Monday is Laguna Beach. There is tons of stuff to do on campus - movies to see, activities to participate in, shows to go and watch...amazing really. Morgan Spurlock (the ""Super-Size Me"" guy) is coming to speak in November and I'm excited for that. So it isn't all bad.

I miss you guys. I hope GB is good and school is bearable. 

I love Bobby :o*

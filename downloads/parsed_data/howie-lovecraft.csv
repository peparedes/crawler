"event","I haven't noted this anywhere -- and there is, in fact, very little in the way of documentation in the real world -- but 12 weeks of work and sweat and fun ended last night.  I played one of the lead roles in a community theater production, and had more fun than I've had in [literally] years.  Drinking in the local bar after rehearsals... flirting with the women in the cast & crew... and having fun with my performance.  The more professional of the cast [and there were a couple] are ready to move on to the next project, and I just want this one to keep going.  Ten weeks of preparation, two weekends of performances, and it's over.  And I'm pretty damn sad about it.  Maybe I'm just getting old... but as I get on in years [what an ""old""-sounding pharse that is], I'm more and more certain that serious fun times are few and far between... and if you luck onto something, you try and hang onto it.  Maybe *this* is the motivation for a lot of mid-life crises.  ""I can't be old!  I haven't had enough fun yet!  Wait!  I'll abandon my current life and get a new <insert over-priced material object or high-maintenance woman here> and that'll be fun, and I'll be happy!""  I don't know if that's me... I'll have to think about it.  Maybe I'm even worse than that.  I'm so greedy that I want fun *and* my current life.  What a fun concept."

"event","More of an acknowledgment of a recent failing.  There's a big issue at work, and I've been very gun-shy about getting it underway... to the point that all I've been doing at work for days is avoidance.  I've chatted online, played computer games, and tried my best to keep from doing anything but the bare minimum.  Now I have several deadlines staring me in the face.  Oh, joy.:-P  I think it'll all work out, if I can maintain my sanity and regain my focus.  Here's hoping.:-D"

"event","Just finished re-reading ""Spencer's Mountain"" by Earl Hamner, Jr.  Good book... a classic -- well worth reading, even if it *was* the inspiration for ""The Waltons"" TV show.:-P  I have an old paperback edition, with little review-blurbs on the cover and on the front page.  Two of the reviewers used the word ""earthy"" in their comments.  I was a little puzzled about that for a long time, but I think I've lived long enough to distinguish the word's significance.  ""Romantic"" and ""passionate"" are the words that a reviewer uses when a country boy and his city girlfriend go up on a wild, untamed mountain and make love and declare their undying affection for one another [this happens in ""Spencer's Mountain""].  ""Earthy"" is the word the reviewer uses when the author mentions that the boy got a serious sunburn on his ass from the day's amorous activities.:-P"

"event","[Originally a little venting I did on a Yahoo site as some friends
bemoaned the closing of a long-time gaming store in Atlanta.]

As I make a serious attempt to avoid work this morning, here are a
couple of thoughts...

There are still some independent game places thriving. There's a
very cool store in Anderson, SC called ""Planet Comics"" that has
comics, a huge array of game stuff, and a large gaming area that
apparently sees a lot of use. My moment of feeling old in there was
when I wandering around and overheard a group conversation about some
RPG or other and this *seriously* gutter-mouthed girl started talking
about a grievance she had with the GM. Instead of thinking, ""Yeah,
that GM she's talking about sounds like a real prick,"" I was, in
fact, thinking, ""Man, I'm glad I didn't have one of my kids with
me... someone needs to tell this girl about 'scaring the straights.""

And then there's the comic/game store on the main drag in Warner
Robins. I've stopped in there several times -- the name of it
escapes me, but it's kind of like the old Historical Hobbies, sort of
long and narrow and dim, but also with gaming stuff and active gaming
groups. My senior moment there came when I overheard a conversation
about a ""Call of Cthulhu"" campaign that sounded interesting, and I
casually asked one of the staff guys, ""So what was going on in that
game you were talking about? Sounded kind of cool."" His response
was, ""Well, sir, it's called a role-playing game, and it's about
these gods from outer space that..."" and I had to interrupt him to
say, ""No, man... I *know* about CoC... what's happening in *your*
campaign?"" And I tried not to think about the fact that I've known
about Cthulhu [at least the stories, if not the RPG] for longer than
this guy has been alive.

Not that I'm bitter.:-D"

"event","I've been meaning to document this someplace before I forget it, and I'm pretty sure I'll lose the slip of paper soon, so here's a brief rant.  What the HELL makes business types feel like they have to make the English language as incomprehensible as possible?  Huh?  What prompted this rhetorical question is a memo I received a couple of weeks ago from the agency that administers our employment benefits.  It was all the usual doubletalk, but one phrase just shattered me.  Here's the phrase -- ""internal interface discussions.""  How's that for the most convoluted way in the world to say ""MEETINGS""???  We're havin' a frickin' meeting!  Short, two syllables... reasonably clear and one can even conjure a mental picture of a room, tables, chairs, and bureaucrats.  ""Internal interface discussions""???  NINE goddamn syllables that are strung together ONLY to cause confusion/irritation.  Okay... I'm done now.

Until they raise the bar again.;-)"

"event","Just past midnight and I just finished reading ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.""  Tough book.  Not, in my opinion, as good as ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" [that book was much more of a roller coaster, and also had more memorable scenes], but still a good read.  And a fast read, as well... 652 pages in an evening.:-)  And now I need to hit the bed... I goofed off mightily at work today.  Can't do the same tomorrow -- the paper's piling up again."

"event","Living in a small town in rural Georgia [where, I hasten to add, I did NOT grow up], you have the opportunity to get to know the geography of a place, as well as the people, and there are multiple facets to both of these types of knowing.  Geography-wise, you get to know the pretty views of the landscape -- where to go to see a really nice lake vista, for instance -- but you also find out where the *really* nasty part of town is -- the neighborhood where the sad, sagging old dogs lie under the sad, sagging old porches and everyone you see looks angry or brain-dead, or both.  Where's this going, you might ask?  Well, I worked the gate for a couple of hours the other night at a street dance in town, and saw another kind of landscape.  This being a community-minded area, the event was thronged, and I saw a lot of people I knew, a lot of people I didn't know, and a really frightening array of toothless, shapeless [and apparently, mindless] people I don't EVER want to know.  I tried to keep the word ""inbred"" from coming out of my mouth, but it was definitely in the front part of my mind.  Maybe some of them are really good folks at heart, but on others, you could just smell the meanness and the stupidity as they lurched and waddled past with their moist, moiling gaggles of spawn... that all looked just as stupid and mean as their parents.  God help us all."

"event","It's hot and steamy here, and not in a good way.:-P  Did some yardwork and finally got the annual pool-cleaning underway.  We've had so many full weekends lately that we've been seriously delayed.  By the time we get the thing cleaned up completely, it'll be time to cover it up again.  Will be very glad when this month is over -- all the budget issues at work come to a head as our fiscal year [or ""physical year"" as nearly every government-associated rube in this town calls it] and it means a lot of idiotic number-juggling.  If I had wanted to be a goddamn accountant, I'd have been a goddamn accountant.:-P  Okay... enough ranting... I'm breaking out my ancient Hawaiian shirt and going to a beach-themed party tonight... there'll be liquor and entertaining people.  And Monday's not 'til tomorrow.:-D"

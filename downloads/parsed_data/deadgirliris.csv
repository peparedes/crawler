"event","the last year has been interesting.

2005 marks the end of me being a musician. i have no interest in performing live. 

i have been doing alot of work lately. writing constantly. going through journals, both online and on paper. i am compiling and putting together a zine finally. what about you ask?? i am writing a zine largely for myself. to document the last 5 years before i started the serious transitioning. 

it's happening kids... 

i am growing up...

hormone therapy is helping me alot... more in a mental way than i had ever though it would... gone are alot of negative patterns that i would fall into... my thoughts can be dealt with rationally. i no longer need to take drugs to take the edge off of life.

some of the stuff i am reading came out of me when i knew people on this site. people that i would consider friends, although i don't speak to alot of them.. increasingly, it seems that they have better things to do than be on the computer all the time like so many of us were 3 or four years ago... that makes me somewhat happy, like maybe we're all getting through our damage...our neurosies etc.... but i can't say that id on't miss certain personalities... alot of writing occured. there are a few out there that i truly adore and would love to hear from... it's been a long time...

it's been almost a year since that fateful day. i can't say that it didn't have to happen, although the aftershock is something that will probably never go away. nor the months afterword... i am truly glad that i have been away from it all, and will continue to be that way for a while... i am actually enjoying my moderate aloofness. still, when i run into (l) it's hard and akward. this was to be my life. (note to you: you are still my prince and always will be. i promise.). 

so i am having all these arguements with my mother... it's hard cause she really wants to supervise my transition... moms... she sometimes comes off as condecending when she refers to me by my name... she still wishes in some ways that i was her five year old son instead of her twenty six year old lesbian daughter. momma, i can't help it. she wants to be in control of my hormone therapy. my dad doesn't really want to deal with it... i understand and don't fault him.  i mean, he has parkinsons to deal with... he wants me to be happy. i am nowhere close to happy or satisfied, but at least i don't feel that i am gonna end it any time soon... mom needs to give me space and quit embarassing me in front of my friends. mom, i am 26 years old. i don't need you going through and critiquing my underwear. i'm a thong kind of girl. deal. but she really just wants to help and she constantly worries about me.

i have to talk to some doctors about going about surgery sometime soon... i gotta figure all this stuff out and blah blah blah... 

right now i wish my brain would turn off...

"event","again i find myself in the portland public library, squinting at a glowing box. across from me is a person wearing a grey shirt that says ""love jesus. love people."". guaranteed, after i told him i liked his shirt and he glared at me, there is one less person in this world he feels comfortable loving.

so what is real for iris exit?

i am questioning everything. for the first time i don't feel comfortable. i don't feel safe anymore. i don't relate to much of anyone. i don't feel like i am even a person. i feel like i am a thick, dried out husk. my relations are turning into nightmares. 

""come on iris"" ""you'll get over it"" ""just look at the bright side"" THERE IS NO FUCKING BRIGHT SIDE! 

i read a book that actually was one of the best trans related books ever written. it's called ""invisible lives"". it's about the erasure of trans people. and trans culture. it mirrors how i feel. 

i need to change my life. i need to get a job.

in order to get a job i have to:

apply as a male.

get a job.

be there for a while.

and then consider the risk of trying to be who i am.

i could lose my job for that.

and i could then spend alot of time, money, and effort fighting it.

and have my life picked apart.

i have that burning acrid taste in my mouth again. 

it's my dead rotting heart.

""yeah iris, that last line was so goth of you""

one of the things i always admired about myself when i was nineteen (and i guess i identified as angry back then) was that i didn't care about anyone's opinion of me. it didn't matter back then. so what is a solution for now? i guess the best solution is to just say fuck it. there is no place for me in this world. none. there is no place in the world (except that one island) that will totally accept me for who i am. i am not going to find a place that everyone will accept me, a place where i can wear dresses and skirts every day, a place that i won't feel uncomfortable with my body hair (hormones have helped though), a place where i could be at peace with myself. there is no public place like that. so fuck em. fuck em all. i have a girlfriend who loves me, and treats me like a lady. dresses and skirts, while beautiful, are not conductive to the lifestyle i lead, and i can't afford to get my genitals mutilated into a vagina. i don't have a pretty face. i don't know how to do my makeup in a way that looks flattering. i only know how to make myself look deathly ill. i am not lucky enough, but i am good enough. really i am. i am sick and tired of only feeling ok when i am stoned.  i am tired of the fucking stupid boys who want to play music with me to impress their friends by having a band with a bitter angry shut in transwoman who is afraid of going outside cause she has been attacked, abused, made fun of, slandered, raped, beaten and left for dead. (this is NOT directed at the other member of oshidori... he is a good one.)

i guess i need to get lessons on how to do make up. and i need to get lessons in not caring. tonight, i am going to go see metalux. i am trying to get the courage to wear a dress."

i had a discussion about the best things that happen in bars with my friend bryan (not my long lost dead brother that i killed by throwing off of an over pass, but eerrily similar in alot of ways), and we both agreed that it's when people drop their wallets in a drunken stupor. hehehe. 

i'd also like to give a shout out to mr. lonestar harrington. congrats on winning in both the job and chair lottery. i'll take you up on a joyride sometime, but only if we can drive down to the dirty duck on bear night...

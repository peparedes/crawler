"event","I've been meaning to take and post some photos of my apartment for ages, but actually making it look not empty and shit has taken forever. I still don't have a bed frame yet, but at least I'm not sleeping on an air mattress anymore. Also I've got a good chunk of the art on the walls instead of just leaning against it now. So
<lj-cut text=""click here and take a peek at stage one of creating a nice little nest."">

I'm probably going to move the bird print once I have something to swap it with, I don't think it goes anymore. 

<img src=""http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/9069/office1jq7.jpg"">
Yeah, we're lazy and moved the tv into the bedroom. one day I'll probably move it back.

<img src=""http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/7882/office5ml1.jpg"">
So the walk in closet was so huge I decided to turn it into an office. Still haven't bought a desk chair, go me. My place has 8 jillion closets it seems like.

<img src=""http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/4433/diningroom1jr8.jpg"">
here's the dining room. Still no real furniture, just a borrowed card table and the patio chairs, but the table cloth disguises that ok I guess.

view of the kitchen from the living room

<img src=""http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/1326/kitchen2kt9.jpg"">
here's the kitchen. Unlike my place in Connecticut, this kitchen actually has counters!

<img src=""http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/9765/livingroomnight1qt0.jpg"">
here's the patio doors and part of the living room. This was taken a month or so ago, so the art is still piled up against the wall looking sad.

<img src=""http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/563/livingroom4gy0.jpg"">
here's my 'accent wall' that they painted the wrong colour, but that ended up ok because I actually really like the brown. It was supposed to be a deep red though. I really need some more art. My wall is looking lonely.

<img src=""http://img78.imageshack.us/img78/7197/livingroom7tb3.jpg"">
see I told you beaucoup closets! That's where I'm storing all my clothes, and some of John's. If you look closely you'll see one of the most retarded non-attention to detail by the apartment people, One of the doors has the pull on the wrong door, so using it to open the bifold doesn't work. I have the same problem on the 'office' door.

<img src=""http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/649/livingroomsofald9.jpg"">
And lastly there's my cheap temporary couch. And my mod $30 target lamp that was supposed to have a gentle arc, but was so cheap it wouldn't go together right and I almost snapped the cord trying to get it to fee back down the base so the pieces would fit together, so now it's got more of a tree branch meandering arc to it. (I call that 'organic' if anyone notices') Also I made the floral pillows out of some fabric napkins I bought a year or so ago at the gadgeteer. (I have to not let myself go in that store because it's full of too many awesome things)

So that's the apartment. I think I'll consider phase one done. Phase two consists of getting a bed frame and an actual dining room table and chairs."

Anyway so my apartment is pretty badass, except for a couple incidents involving hte kitchen sink backing up and then the pipes under it deciding the leak and then a couple days later when the power company came and changed me over to a new flashy type of metre the I didn't have power in my bathroom or bedroom for 3 days and had to shower by the light of a flashlight .(I did have a candle but for some reason it set off the smoke detector.  Other than that it's been pretty swell. I'll have photos one day I'm just sort of waiting to have some furniture, or at least to hang hte art on the wall instead of it sitting in a stack against it.

My relationship is going rather well still, 

but probably nicest of all is I applied for the Dialogue Designer job and got it, so now I'm actually doing something related to my degree in  a way and I make almost twice my old salary. I'm all kind of middle class and shit now, well once it starts showing up on my pay cheques. This means I'll be able to afford furniture and shit, I actually make enough to cover my rent in one week, how bad ass is that?

I'm going to be in Omaha for a chuck of time now, but hey I'm still young and all that, I can move away later."

"event","I'm finally getting around to teaching myself some programming languages. I was rather entertained by the fact that I found a really, sort of detrimental typo in the very first chapter and it was in the code so if you try to program the example the program won't run because there's a syntax error. It's the first chapter Thompson publishing, don't you think you should be able to do a decent job proofing the simple stuff?

Also my windows machine managed to pick up a trojan inexplicably since I haven't even used it in a month so I had to waste time cleansing it of viruses. I swear one of these days I'm just going to convert it to Linux and be done with it. I've already gotten quite stripped of my lazy comfort zone with the microsoft set up the more I use me mac (though I will never ever like the lack of right click with macs, that is the single most irritating difference for me) of course it will be figuring out which version of Linux to go with that may prove too much work for my lazy self.

It's only another month until (hopefully) I'll move to my own place, I'd be out this month if it weren't for the matter of having no furniture and the expense that buying the bare essentials of furniture is going to be. Fortunately I'm so busy at work that time moves by pretty quickly. 

Speaking of work, I had my first one on one meeting with my boss over how everything's been going etc etc (we're supposed to have them once a month, but it doesn't always happen) and his only real 'thing I should change' not e was that I need to stop working so much. I should record that for posterity eh? I do work a ridiculous amount, but there have been some very logical changes that have occurred lately that once I get caught up from the backlog that the migration to the new method created for me, then it should save me a ton of paperwork and time since now i won't have to request other people do do those steps anymore I can just do them myself, plus doing them takes less time than actually filling out the request to have them done, let alone the time waiting for someone else to get around to it. I've shaved at least 3 days off the expected turnaround. (actually it's way more than 3 days, but I'm not making any promises that will end up giving me ulcers in the future :) ) and I get to farm off my most time eating, irritating task off to some people farther down the totem pole shortly, which unless they fuck it up purposefully so as not to have to do it again will take away another giant stress and mean I'll only have to deal with that shit for special research occaisions. yay! I think everyone is really worried that I'm going to burn out and quit or something. There have been a few pretty crap weeks for workload and cluster this past month, but really it hasn't been that bad. (OK so Thursday I left only a half hour after the end of regular business hours and was freaked out by the fact that it was still light out, which kind of gives you an idea of how long it's been since I actually left on time ;) ) I'm pretty happy that at least 3 people from the client whose account I work on have commended me to my bosses. I'm also quite happy that I've been spending a large number of not in work hours drinking beer and talking with the object of my affection. (thoughit's been a month now,  which is pretty much the limit of anyone I've been invovled with in person retaining interest in me, so he'll probably wake up and wonder what he saw in me any day now)"

"event","g-d I can't wait for this week to be over. This has been the fucking worst work week ever. I didn't leave the office until 11 pm last night and I still didn't get to leave until 6.30 today, plus I only got a half hour lunch because another crisis came up right as I was putting up my away message to leave for lunch. And these fucking bastards think it's all fine and dandy to request a next day expedite after we've told them no less than 4 times this week that upstairs has issued a proclamation that they won't authorise any expedites until further notice.

I had exactly 1.5 hours during regular office time where I was not in a meeting today and the system we use for appdev requests is making a change effective tomorrow that's going to make the whole process slow and painful, essentially every time I need to ask for a compile even for one that will take like 15 minutes to complete, I have to go through a process that includes 3 different estimate/ management approvals before the programmer can do the simple request. I understand well the need for auditable practises shit I used to be an auditor (sure different type of company but we error detecting bean counters are essentially the same at heart) but the process implemented to facilitate ease of oversight shouldn't work to slow down a process that the clients already find too slow, especially on requests that aren't billable in the first place and barely impact time accounting in a noticable way.

Don't you love when I bitch about work since I never actually go in to what I do or any detail? I have a deep irritation, but you'll never know who for if you don't know me in person.  Vagueness keeps anyone from my company somehow managing to find me complaining about it. 

Oh, on the tooth buddy icon: I have found out definitively that prior to the day I posted on it, he did not have a tooth, so for whatever reason he changed to it because of my tooth icon. I love the way I refuse to pump anyone at work for what they know about him because then people would inevitably start gossiping about how I'm smitten, so I have to run across these things that I would have otherwise known when they were relevant weeks later. That's why I've been working there for almost 5 months and I know exactly 3 things about him, 1. he's originally from Wayne, 2. his father teaches University level Chemistry and 3 He didn't have a tooth buddy icon until a couple weeks ago. Okay 4. His birthday is in March, because it's on the birthday list on the wall (our office is into the whole passing around cards and having cake in the break room thing, it makes me think of that Seinfeld episode every time there's a birthday) okay 5,  I think he's got a strong sense of good character as evidenced by the thing with the bar tab at the going away party. sigh..."

Also I'm fairly worried about the client asking for expedites this week because basically we can't do them right now because someone in the department that takes care of step one of the process I have to go through to compile a number for the client was terminated last week and that department has put their foot down about refusing expedites until they've hired a replacement, and the emails from them started to get a little nasty (I'm too smart to take part in that email back and forth, that's the one department I don't want to garner any ill will in, since so much of my time is spent wheedling expedites out of them.) I really want to know what happened that led to the firing, damn we need some interdepartmental gossip mongers!  Also one person keeping spotty records and being really slow to respond to email is driving me nuts right now. Definitely don't have time to get sick.

Does anyone else think there's about to be a major craft/diy/handmadey stuff backlash right soon? I'd really say we're due for one. I know I'm starting to get worn thin of it. Not so much the handmade as in a person who's gone into business for themselves and makes well designed and high quality goods, I'm always excited for that stuff because unique good quality things are where too much of my disposable income goes, but I mean the 824,675,331 people who think that just because they enjoy making a craft they need to open a fucking etsy store to sell it, even when it's kind of half-assed. And seem to be under the impression that half-assed equals authentic hand-srafted charm. Guess what... It doesn't. And in fact the fact that everyone basically does the same stuff and uses the same nice Alexander Henry fabrics means that the whole uniqueness of all of it is diluted to the point that you might as well not spend the money to buy from a person rather than a company because it's practically like you're buying mass market and it defeats the whole purpose. It seems the only difference anymore is that some people's stuff is good quality and often they do it first and then the rest is like the cheap knockoffs you buy in Chinatown, only being all indie there's no name recognition when you insist you've got the nice one.  

People like craft and diy because it's a way to feel useful in our increasingly mechanised world, that's cool, I do crafty things myself, I'm not railing against it (though maybe I am a bit depending on what it is that's being done/made, I really really despise a lot of the fake it projects you see especially on home improvement/ home and garden shows, because the fact is that shit just looks cheap, and even if it looks sort of okay now in a few months or a year it will look like the fast cheap fake shit it is. Just spend the damn money and do it right, so maybe it means you can't buy as many knicknacks to finish off the 'look' or eat 3 times a day for a month, quality always comes through. And I've watched enough HGTV and related channels to now know that the first question out of my mouth if I ever, ever think of buying a house or any other property is going to be 'Is this property being flipped?' because if it is I will be out the door and down the street so fast the half-assed drywall job they've likely done will fall down in breeze my departure leaves behind.) I guess the fact that everyone knits, sews, etc, etc now is kind of boring, and I've got a big case of indiesnob elitism going on the same way that that favourite band that no one knows about loses some of its luster the first time you hear their single in a tv commercial hawking automobiles or hair colour. You know you should be happy for them, but they just aren't your secret anymore."

"event","I'm getting kind of fixated on this notion of having my own apartment.  I think I've pretty much decided that it's what I'm going to do, the part of me that still just wants to depart for London as soon as humanly possible is feeling sick over this decision. We all know how much I love impermanence, but I think given my life long dedication to being rubbish with financial matters this is probably the only way I'm going to manage to learn what it's going to take to succeed in my master plan. It's only a delay, what are the odds that I'd honestly run into a reason to stay more than a couple of years? (answer pretty fucking bad) 

I've noticed that I have this propensity to like to think I'm indecisive, but in reality I make up my mind on things which I can be bothered to need to make a decision on very quickly and then the rest of hte time is just spent trying to talk myself into being alright with the decision I've already made. I'm not certain if I find this to be one of my more inexcusably annoying habits or not yet.

But anyway, the part of me that's not whining about minor inconveniences is really into the whole idea of a place that's all to myself. Especially the idea of decorating that space. It's going to be a big financial expenditure seeing as the only piece of furniture I own is my desk. Just the desk, not even a desk chair, I'm sitting on an old rust orange 70s era reclining wingback chair. (I moved into my parents' library when I came back which is much more literary sounding than the actual space is as I'm the only one in the family who reads intellectual or classic books. The only thing of culture down here that's not mine are the bulk of my mother's classical and opera records) I've been out this weekend trying to price furniture so i've an idea how much the basic necessities like a bed and a sofa and a dining room table are going to set me back. It actually sort of turned into christ furniture is ugly. There isn't even prohibitively expensive modern furniture to look at Nebraska Furniture Mart (which is rather surprising considering that they are the biggest furniture store in the midwest) The area with anything remotely in my tastes is one tiny little corner of the basement, with some modernish futons that might make for a decent sofa and are only about $300 which is in the lesser end of the  range I was expecting to fork out for a sofa. I really wish there was an Ikea here. Then I could get something more my taste that was cheap so I wouldn't feel crap about the fact that in 2 years thereabouts I'll be getting rid of it to go overseas.   Actually I did see one pseudo danish modern sofa but it was huge, way too big for any apartment I'd have. Also probably way too expensive. Why the hell is everyone into fucking poofy slouchy furniture? It's hideous."

"event","2006 Top 10 Albums: (no order, fuck it's hard enough to actually narrow this shit down to 10, there was a lot of good stuff this year)<lj-cut text=""I thought I'd not take up your entire friends page, so you'll have to click here to read my music opinions"">

<b>Psapp- The only thing I ever wanted</b> I think this is my favourite album this year (favourite doesn't mean best though, I actually agree with the pitchfork reviewer about the slight flatness of the background especially when listening to the vinyl. )
<b>Final Fantasy- He Poos Clouds</b> If you've heard this album, and you know my tastes, you'll know why I like it, It's  like an indie pop album filtered through the soundtrack from a silent film and shot back into the world. I fucking love this guy. I'm a sucker for chamber pop I admit.
<b>Daedelus- Denies the Days Demise</b>Thom Yorke's been getting the props on other critics lists for experimental electronica due to his being, well, Thom fucking Yorke, but if you ask me between the Eraser and this album, I think Daedelus has put forth the more compelling and interesting album and that's exactly why Denies the Days Demise is here and Thom Yorke is in the honourable mention section this time.
<b>Gnarls Barkley- St Elsewhere</b> It was a given that this would be here I suppose, it's a fucking good album, I don't think I can think of one song on there that's not strong. Plus they covered my all time favourite Violent Femmes song. The album actually occaisionally reminds me of Mike Patton's interesting but inconsistent 2006 release, Peeping Tom, only here everything succeeds.
<b>Arctic Monkeys- Whatever people say I am that's what I'm not</b> (I swear that this came out in 2005 but I guess it's just that I heard demos and all that last December as it wasn't actually released until Januarry) As loathe as I am to say anything nice about any band that Liam Gallagher extolls in print, goddamnit this was the catchiest album of the year. I know, it's popular, mainstream radio loves it and they're the band whom everyone was in the knobshine line over, but it is a really solid and welldone album and one should never poopoo a good assshaking.
<b>The Knife- Silent Shout</b> infectious danceable electro, I could get music elitest about why it's good, but I'll refrain.
<b>Ed Harcourt- the beautiful lie</b> very solid pop album from British singer-songwriter, I went on about this album earlier in the year in a post and it's managed to stand up nicely (though he'd be in honourable mentions I suspect if I'd actually gotten around to listening to the Tom Waits album I somehow missed noticing had been released. oops)
<b>Kasabian-- Empire</b> you occaisionally need some swaggering electro rock and roll in your life. I've been amused that most of the negative reviews for the album grouse that they're ripping off the wrong decade, but if everyone was on that 80s bandwagon... well the world can only have so many Neo-wave bands now can't it  and it's already getting impossible to tell them all apart.
<b>Jarvis Cocker-- Jarvis</b> I pretty much love everything about Jarvis Cocker in general, except for the fact that his new 'look' can only be described as 70s era paedo chic to the point that I seriously find myself wondering if he's gone out and bought himself a nice retro brown full size conversion van with the little bubble windows on the sides and red shag carpeting in the back to drive about town in. I mean I loved back in the day when he mooned Michael Jackson at an awards show before it was totally the in thing to dis the 'king of pop' and I loved even more that he let out that back in the heyday of Pulp he used to pay impersonators to go out at gigs and do all the requisite Jarvis Cocker posturing that the fans all wanted because he was sick of it all and just wanted to do the singing.  And I love how he started a really good band pretty much for the soul purpose of taking the piss of Fischerspooner. But anyway, about the album: When all is said and done with our generation and we start really taking a look at who the really important musicians of it were, who's really going to stand the test of time; Cocker is going to be among them. He's flat out one of the best songwriters in the last 20 years and if there was any doubt of that claim, you merely need to listen to this record. 
<b>Decemberists- The Crane Wife</b> You can debate me on it all you like, but I don't think this album is as good as Picaresque or Castaways and Cutouts. There's something different and more tired about this record, but it's hard to pinpoint what it is because it's still a great album so it's hard to put my finger on what exactly I feel somewhat disapointed in with it. It continues to grow on me, though. The more interesting stuff are the tracks with the more 70s psychedelic tones to them like <i>the perfect crime</i> and <i> the island:...</i>. The more, I guess you'd call it traditional Decemberists fare is sort of missing that special Edwardian edge that really opened up the world that exists in Colin Meloy's songs in private cinema before your eyelids. Here it just seems like oridnary indiepop. Don't get me wrong, it's still better than most ordinary indie pop and the album was still one of the best of the year, it's just lacking that really special ambiance that elevates it over its contemporaries that I've come to expect from the Decemberists. I think they've outgrown the shanty-core, but are afraid to completely abandon the sound that got them the notoriety they deserve, or maybe they want to avoid being associated with it and are trying a little to hard to avoid going there for another album.. I'll be quite interested to see where the next album takes them.

the sad thing is I can't even remember another really good show this year, but then 2006 was not a year that I actually went to very many shows, more often I planned to go to shows and then sort of decided I couldn't be bothered at the last minute, if buying advanced tickets for 1% shows didn't result in paying a 'convienience charge' of 1/3 to 1/2 of the face value of the fucking tickets maybe I'd have gone to more shows, but when you're not forking your money over for the tickets until you get to the door, if you're me you're just as apt to just not feel like getting up off the couch and going out again once you're home. Seriously if buying online in advance cost me no more than the 2% that the credit merchants charge 1% to process my card or hell even 5% of the ticket value, I'd be all over it but 50% no fucking way, not unless it's a band I desparately want to see and think will actually sell out. And so far there's not a single 1% show through March that they've got up on their site that I've any interest in seeing. There are 2 I might go to for the hell of it, but mostly it's just blah. I hope that improves.


oh and 2006 featured not one but two Oingo Boingo tribute albums and holy shit neither of them sucked ass. Dead Band's Party had the bigger names with trendier pop punk ska bands, which really makes a bit of sense given the pioneering Boingo had in that SoCal ska-punk influenced sound. and Clear static did a cover of Dead Man's Party that I actully may like better than the original. Drink to Bones that Turn to Dust was actually the better album though, as it played less like a bunch of bands who play styles similar to what Oingo Boingo did basically making versions that sound quite similar to the originals but just not as good and more like what a real tribute album ought to be a diverse group of bands with wildly different sounds taking on one artist's work and showing how really great it is by it's malleability. On that album you've got alt-country people, hip hop people, indie rock people really reforming songs  in a way that showcases them. 

That's all I'm closing the books on 2006"

"event","Hmm, time for those obligatory year end posts. I guess I'll start with the much easier review of my life one (the music ones are always so fucking hard to do because keeping track of what stuff I discovered actually came out this year and wasn't just a new discovery is always a pain in the butt)

2006 was rather a roller coaster of a year and it sort of got all derailed at the end here and now I'm just facing making a lot of really important decisions that are rather tough for me to want to think about. 

this year's big minuses:
  - Ben starting to see a girl ending our quasi dating long distnace relationship (which might have been for the best or something, but still sucks monumentally)
  - Missing 8 jillion deadlines to move because of a lack of funds.
  - Spending another year living in my parents' basement 
  - Continued lack of anything that resembles a social life, especially as everyone I've been friends with since moving back are pretty much all graduated now and moving out of town,
  - Wasted 8 months of this year working at the fucking carpark.
  - Still haven't learned how to not be socially awkward or speak to guys I find attractive.

this year's pluses:
  +Ended up with a good job with a good company with really good co-workers. And it was all pretty much just a fell into it thing, Also I won't lie it was really really nice for once to have people in upper management who saw that I was good at what I did and want to hire me into a more advanced position rather than my having to fight tooth and nail for any tiny advancement because I'm not an ass-kisser, especially since it's for a definitely CVable position and not some crap job in retail. 
   +despite shit moments of life have not had a major bout of depression or severe panic attack or any major mental shit at all 
   + managed to make some objective decisions even when they go against my base desire to get the fuck out of this city because I really need to make the decisions that will benefit me most in the long run, the big picture.
   +Paid off all my non-student loan related debt.
   +Lost a lot of the weight I'd gained in Connecticut, I now only have 20lbs to go to be back to my hockey playing weight, and only about 7 til I'm back to a healthy BMI. 

Hmm I guess it was a bit of a shit year over all, my pluses aren't very exciting. I don't feel like it was aloss of a year though despite the fact that I was mainly thwarted and disappointed, because it's been the kind of adversity that you can really focus on decideing what you want and what's important. I also find that finally I'm not bothered by my own company. I don't know if that's how I want to say it, but you know I'm not bothered going to a restuarant on my own and eating by myself and going to films myself. and I used to be so self concsious about that,Granted I'd liketo be more socially savvy or have someone to go out with, but I don't feel that my own company is burdensome, and maybe that's a step towards being able to be more social, afterall if you can't convince yourself that you're interesting enough to spend time with how will you ever convince anyone else of that right? I've been really forcing myself to make appearances at post-work work related social things, like the holdiay party and the going away party at the pub last night, I may spend them mostly mute and just listening to other people (or when a certain programmer is present wishing that I did not have the social skills of a retarded porcupine and sneaking glances at him all night) but eventually maybe I'll just forget to be afraid I'll make an berk of myself or that I might say the wrong thing and that I'm always working on my skill of being as invisible as possible. Hell maybe I'll accidentally have a conversation with the programmer. 

2007 should be a very interesting year I think. It's goingto be a scary year actually because there are so many decisions to be made that impact my future and I'm petrified that any of them will in one way or another be my ruin. They all revolve around my moving. or really more of when I move. Right now the plan has been to go in either December 2007 or January 2008, but recently I made a financial fuckup that was of the sort I thought I'd put behidn me that reminded me of how really difficult what I'm planning is going to be and how much I risk really failing at life and I really refuse to fail, not this time, when I do move to London it's going to be for good, No more failing to live on my own terms and crawling back with my tail between my legs because shit didn't really go the way I'd planned. I'm too old not to be takingm y own destiny in hand. And I am slightly worried because I've never been able to keep it together financially, maybe I've not been a total failure, but I've always managed to have some period of time where I needed to have freind/roommate float a month or two for me or ask my family for help, and I won't have that option when I go. So I've been thinking with some seriousness about delaying my move til the end of 2009 and getting my own apartment, to convince myself that I can cut being a financially respsonsible adult for a period of time before I go. I don't really want to be in Omaha 3 years, but if I got an apartment it will push the timeline that far out because obviously I'll have the rent and bills part of adult living sucking up my wages, (no way in hell I'm I living in the basement for 3 years! fuck that shit) On my salary I should be able to comfortably afford a studio or one bedroom in Dundee or close to work on my own  with cable and internet and pay bills and put away a couple hundred a month and still have enough for food and entertainment and all that.  (also the idea of having a whole place to myself with no roommates or anything is quite appealing and this is like to be the only time in my life I'll ever have that, certainly won't be able to afford that in London) It's all pretty scary. I guess I have a few months til I'd even be able to get an apartment to try to figure out what is the best decision for what I want my life to be like in the long run."

"event","Why do they let total idiots appear on Bargain Hunters? Is the secret purpose of the show not to see who can actually pick antiques from a car boot sale/fleamarket and make a profit, but instead to make people and experts look stupid, whilst watching a prestenter who is a frightening tribute to middle age male crises who clearly is under the impression that he might be Tom Jones if he only tries hard enough and has a penchant for dressing like some sort of cartoon Corleone?

What always kills me about the show is that you will, without fail, almost always get a moment in which someone will hoist up some kind of bottle usually without a lid and then both the contestants and the expert will ooh over how it's a nice little decorative ink-well, when it's 200 year old white porcelian or ceramic and doesn't have a bit on staining from the ink on it. You arse it's a scent bottle that someone lost the lid to. 

Speaking of tv, I've officially read the best critic simile ever now. It would, of course, come from Charlie Brooker, my personal review writing god. Referring to the incessant dourness of the new Prime Suspect, he quipped...

'It was like being trapped in a coffin watching a depressed mouse slowly build a tiny gallows for itself out of lolly sticks, and being unable to stop it because you couldn't lift your arms. Well, vaguely.'

oh how I love that man's mind."

"event","So the AM I woek with gave us boxes of cherry cordials for the holiday today. It was actually a sit around on my ass sort of day for once, I actually spent it staring at the monitor trying to clean up my number grids, which were a combination of utter mess or nonexistant when I took over this account's pool. That gives me way too much time for my nerdy ponderings. Anyway so these cherry cordials say on the box, 'made with real chocolate' Now pardon me if I sound crazy, but why would you want to say something like 'made with real chocolate' on a box of chocolates? I mean if one is buying a box of chocolates in the first place isn't the consumer's assumption going to be that they are made with chocolate? Telling me that something that is intrinsically chocolate contains chocolate just makes me suspect that it might not in fact be what it claims. 

In fact any food 'made with real' whatever is inherently suspect anyway, what does that mean the have 3 microns of the real substance in it? How about 'made of real' whatever. And what the hell is fake chocolate? is it like that carnellian red food dye that's actually made of crushed up beetle exoskeletons and you're just better off not know what's really in it?"

"event","I've been especially shite this year about updating this journal, perhaps next year I'll be better. Anyway there are actually things to update with too, how silly.

So the last couple weeks have been pretty roller coaster , but a bit shit. Ben and I are officially just friends from now on instead of quasi anything, he's started seeing someone, which as you may guess from the kind of gushy tones of my prior posts about him really sucks for me. I've actually been far more stoical about it than even I thought I'd be. I've been working the whole time to make sure I didn't cross over a line between liking him but being realistic about shit based on the fact that I'm still in the US and he's there and developing fantasies based on on online attraction, so I'd say I did a pretty good job of it when I look at this news as something that's a bit lousy but not crushing and I'm really cool with just being friends with him and also this way I feel less guilty about every missed target date for moving. Who knows maybe when I do finally move and we hang out maybe some guy he knows will be the guy for me or some shit and that's why I was supposed to meet him. (ok I don't really buy into that scripted destiny stuff, but I do recognise the fact that whatever does ending being your story in life only ends up being that way because you made all the specific choices that you did and lived the life you had up until that moment.)

I should also mention that I've become brilliant at dealing with crappy emotional things and I haven't had anything near a relapse of depression, which is kind of amazing. Now if I could only totally kick my social anxiety and general shyness, and knowledge that I'd only make a complete prat of myself if I talked to my secret crush who I know wouldn't be interested in me anyway because I always make sure to have secret crushes on people I absolutely have no shot with. I'd be on my way to being legendary :)

So as you may guess from posting about feeling guilty about constantly missing target dates for moving, I'm still in Omaha and actually will be for the foreseeable future. Basically I have nowhere near the sum I need to move, I'm actually sort of where I was a year ago this time, making no progress is quite frustrating (well I've made some progress I mean I have my British Passport and all, plus I have my Mac laptop so it's not a total waste of a year) but I'm trying to learn from the mistakes of planning I made and thus I have gotten  a proper job, even if that means I may have to stay on  a few months beyond when I've managed to save up the sum I need, it's better in retrospect to have to stay a couple months longer and just have some extra money than it is to have the freedom to leave the second I've saved it up only to be here longer than I'd have been in the other circumstance because I never seem to manage to save up the sum.

So officially on Monday (unless I somehow manage to fail the background check that hadn't come back yet as of Friday, but as I haven't been convicted of any crimes that I know of I think i'll be okay, though if you know me, you know I'm always paranoid about such things, like that that parking ticket I never paid in Willimantic will come back to haunt me (not worried enough to send them a checque of course :) but that ticket was total bullshit) ) I'm an Associate Account Manager for a place to be known only as X corporation which is where I've been temping the last 3 months, Plus work keeps me completely busy during hte workday so time goes really fast which is good when hanging around a city one doesn't want to be in at bloody all. 

Since I'm looking at being stuck here another 8 months at least I think I'm going to try to really concentrate on my art, I'm thinking of getting membership in the printmakers guild so that I can use the studio space and equipment there and also I want to try to buy a bolex and start making some films and I've got some pretty good (I think) ideas on some installation video stuff that I'd like to do, including building some kinetoscopes. Make use of my time trapped for good and not moping. 

So I'd say that all in all I was doing pretty good despite setbacks  And that in a nutshell is my story right now."

"event","My department at my job has been expanding like crazy, and people there keep trying to get me to apply for a permanent position. One of the latest pressurings seems to be that they're trying to get another QA posistion created, which would make sense seeing as the QA department is 2 people and the account manager who does their scheduling but not the actual testing because he has too much other shit to do, and thy're crazy overworlked and they've picked up at least 4 new account managers inc the last 2 months so the workload can only be getting bigger. Anyway, she wants me to apply for it if they do manage to get it opened, and to be honest I'm a bit tempted, but definitely torn about that. I mean I have no desire to remain in Omaha, and don't really wish to do anything that might further mire me here, which is why I've rebuffed even considering applying for any of the opened positions, because even if my ever imminent departure were not an issue in hiring (and I can't really see how it wouldn't be) I wouldn't take a position without being ready to commit at least 6 months to it (and the thought of 6 more months in omaha feels me with misery) however I fell tempted by it for several reasons, not the least of which is that the way I dodder along on this path to the finances to actually move I'll be here that long anyway, I'd probably be making more as a full time regular employee for one and if it's going to take me half a year to actually raise the capital anyway, I mean it's already been 6 months or more since I was supposed to first have been relocated, it just keeps moving back and moving back as finances don't move as swiftly and other necessary expenses come up basically if I'd gone for a regular job and stooped thinking I knew my timelines or how long it would actually take to raise 6 grand back when I first graduated then I'd probably have the money now and have spent long enough in whatever job that I wouldn't have felt guilty about it. Also it makes sense from the standpoint of the future jobhunt, position with title, actual position looks much better on CV and to be honest I actually like doing QA stuff, I don't know whether that might lead to a QA position in another industry (I don't think London is a big hub of inbound telemarketing applications :) ) but it might be and it might also be an inroad to other such detail orriented copy-editing of some sort. a regular position always lloks better than a temporary one after all.  and also if I get stuck here a few months more than when my target sum has been reached well extra money is always good it makes for less job finding desparation.

However it would be more time here maybe, I know I genearlly just want to get out of this fucking city and out of the country as soon as I can, I don't want to feel shackled or obligated to it and that makes the idea of gritting myteeth and being logical really hard to take, andno matter how level headed I am about my friendship/corresondence/whatever the hell you want to call it with Ben and how everything about this relocation and move is in fact about me and me wanting to go and doing it right and just not expecting a damn thing other than friendship out of our friendship even though I would be very very happy if something more did come about, I can not pretend that a good chunk of me being very torn up pondering this idea and wanting to resist the very impressively logical logic of the voice of reason does not come from the feeling that the longer I continue to be stuck here the less and less likely it is that anything more than friendship will happen not as much because it's hard to keep interest in someone half a world away because I think if we were compatible and all in that way it would likely reignite itself if it were faded somewhat upon the actual intorduction of each others actual pressence in the same spot though the length of time could i suppose sort of whittle away at a sense of mystery and all, but no the real trouble is I fear in some other girl who actually lives there currently snatching him up some things are all about timing I've learned the hard way throughout my life. I mean I'm unlikely to get involved with anyone else (even if a couple of our programmers are really cute) because doing so would create strings that might make it tough to get out of here (and there is nothing that would make it a good idea for me to remain in Omaha, this city is like gangrene for me anyway) but he's another story.

It's all probably a moot point anyway  it's not like said position is open and accepting applications or anything it's all just what if thoughts, I think I'm just doomed to be frustrated by something no matter what."

"event","I've just been through my bookcasesdoing I guess what you'd call the first culling. I wish I could call it the final culling, but really there are far too many books left even though I pulled out ove3r a hundred books, some whichI've had since high school, some of the books I so far can't bear to put in the boxes I've had since grammar school. I know I'm going to have to scrap my complete set of Fletch novels, and they're ones I've had for literally over 20 years now, all vintage 70s mass market paperbacks (except Fletch which is the movie tie in mass market with Chevy Cahse on the cover) I mean I know they've all been re-issued by black lizard/ vintage with snazzy new covers which for some reason the disgn of which took the weird desicison to just quote big passages of text from inside on the front cover from the original covers and I could just rebuy them in London and I'd have nicer trade paperbacks, but still you don't just have a book on your shelves for 20 years without it feeling like a replacement wouldn't be the same. 

Pulling the books has really made me feel like shit emotionally and I don't really know why.  I think I'd probably like it to be some kind of first twinge of the enormousness of this upcoming move because that would make sense, I honestly have not had one single twinge of well fear about it, I've been mostly *shrug* well it's going to be a big step and obviously it's going to be quite  an adventure, but everything in life worthwhile is a risk and going to tst your mettle isn't it. The fact that I haven't felt nagging doubts or fears  is why I know that going is the right decision. It's not over-confidence or because i have some delusion that it's going to be easy, I do know the risks especially since I'm going to London instead of the North where at least I've family  within easy reach and know no one except Ben, who at least I've spoken to for long enough that I feel more than reasonably certain is not secretly a psycho.  The thing is I never know what I want of life, am rarely really taken enough by anything or anyone or any interest to really expend focus on it for long; usually I'm nagged by doubts or fears or enormity or I just burn out on the idea and move on, but those things which  I've really cared about or really wanted and really squared up and fought and in the end succeeded at may not have been easy, but they shared one common thing in me and that was a total lack of fear or doubt about the decision. So that's how I know that this what I need to do and it's the right decision for me and that it will work out because I will make it work out by sheer force of will. 

Nope this is just about fucking coccooning. Coccooning and materialism and possessions and everything I've come to be really horrified about in myself which is one of the reasons I honestly feel I need to get out of the US. Which is a thing I don't think so many people will understand and I guess it's not exactly an isolated to the United States thing, but it's such a fabric of everything, everywhere I've ever lived in the US. I'm probably just hoping that the drasticness of the culture change and of the relocation will help to let me just stop my magpie ways and make more meaningful decisions in terms of acquiring.  Anyway... (one day I'll post a little treatise on what I'm talking about in terms of the aspects of American culture that I really find truly worrisome so that it's not just some general america bad crap. Politicians change my worries are culture driven not just my issues with the current political climate, though there are quite a few aspects of that they really fuck me off. I'm more concerned with disposability of modern life and how nothing means anything anymore amongst other things) Now I just have to figure out how I'm going to disseminate these books.  Unfortunately if I donate them to the public library they won't be put into their collection even the ones which are good quality hardbacks or trade paperbacks and which the system does not currently have any copies of, they'll just sell them at their used book sale which isn't really in the spirit of what I want done with them. it might be nice to be able to get a tax deduction for them , but not entirely necessary. Selling them via ebay or amazon seems way too much of a hassle to really be worth it. I think it's not like any of them are some kind of brilliant first edition classic or anything. I'm thinking of posting a list and if anyone happens to be in Omaha and wanted any of them I could see them off to a good home. but other than that I'm going to have to ponder."

See it, I'm serious see it.  Just like Eternal Sunshine it's very moving and original and not entirely happy and amazing. It's relly real which is kind of an odd thing to say about a film which a significant portion of it is  in the fantastically surreal dreams of the main character. I really really love it. I love it more than I loved Little Miss Sunshine, which had been the only film this summer/fall that didn't disapoint expectations.

Yeah so I went to the doctor today about getting new prescriptions for my asthma, it turns out that the inhaler I'd switched to, which works better because it's not really just for rescue but if you take it like you're suppoesd to it helps manage asthma so you don't get as many attacks, is $104 per inhaler, so as you might guess I'm not going to be filling htat script anytime soon. I just got a new Albuterol rescue inhaler which becasue it's available in generic was only $25. But I'm supposed to call the lady in charge of medication assistance program paoerwork and see about applying for the program for Advair so I can start on that again (which I can't afford otherwise because it's $125 for one of those discs) so hopefully $9 and hour is poor enough to qualify for that. G-d I'm so fucking sick of not being able to afford to manage my asthma and allergies and instead having to go around miserable and treat attacks. She gave me a nebuliser treatment in the office becuase my breathing test numbers were crap though I didn't feel as bad as usual this morning, I did feel a lot better though after."

"event","I've been looking up and inputting routing numbers all day for the last 3 days (okay so today I sat around twiddling my thumbs for a fucking hour and a half because the keepers of hte technology can't seem to get around to getting me a passcode for the program I need access to or to install it on the computer I'm supposed to be on despite the office manager emailing them 11 times so I've been packed around to various other people's computers who weren't in the office so that I can use their program. what a waste of time) but anyway inputting routing numbers is farly repetitve and mindless and I can let my mind wander. So what I've been wondering about the last day is this:

You know how people always say they wish they could go back and live some part of their life again knowing then what they know now, well what if you woke up as yourself in your past, would you really feel obligated to change your past. What I maen is I was thinking it would be pretty entertaining to wake up as myself in grade 7, but my current self, just because junior high was really really miserable for me and I think I would have a laugh as my smart0mouthed adult self pulling people down a peg. I mean I was smart-mouthed back then, but I'd have the bonus of really knowing that I don't give a shit what those people think of me because trying to play nice never did work, and I also have the knowledge as an adult that 80% of the crap I put up with from boys was because they probably had wet dreams about me (as about the only girl with an impressive rack in the 7th grade) which horrified them because I wasn't eh kind of girl they wanted to wank over.  Yeah, so I think if I had a chance to be me again I'd be more interested in taking hte piss rathre than trying to change things because to behonest, yeah big chunks of my past sucked amazingly hard and I survived a lot of things that I should probably want to change, but then I wouldn't be who I am and there are a lot of good things I woulnd't have gotten to experience if I had (that's probably step one to being mentally and emotionally healthy r, realising that) 

but anyway while I was daydreaming about how certain terrible att he time lunch room events would have gone if my 29 year old up on sexual euphemisms not so laughably innocent self were cracking comebacks on my 12 year old nemeses instead of my naive 12 year old self,  I suddenly wondered what I would have done about Norman. Could I really just sit there idly and let time go on as it had (Norman committed suicide quite suddenly and unexpectedly in January of our 7th grade year. It really fucked a lot of people up myself included, though sadly it wasn't the first death of a friend I'd dealt with.) knowing that doing something and preventing it would have changed the course of time and therefore most likely alter the rest of my future entirely, Would I feel obligated to try to save someone because just once there would be that oppurtunity. That's kind of a headythought to have the power perhaps to save someone, but then again even if I said, okay the obligation of doing something to save someone is more important than trying to live almost he same life to become the same person in the end so screw it, how yould one really even go about doing htat. I mean how could you possibly go about communicating that if something isn't done a person will be dead on a certain day without appearing totally batshit crazy or maybe implicated. Or worse with a bunch of people thinking you're some kind of weirdo psychic.All of which would probably fuck up your life. Could you really go through that part of life again knowing that someone was going to blow their brains out and not do a damn thing and try to act like it was a surprise and know that you could have tried to do something to prevent it but didn't? 

I don't know why people want to time travel at all. Way too fucking complicated if you ask me. Also all those people who want to live in different times, especially women, man fuck that it was intolerable to be a woman in pretty much any time prior to the 1920s, jesus. seriously."

I'm going to make it a point not to spread any more of my frustrationa around, not allow myself to be frustrated until I've talked to the temp agency on Tuesday and the worst case scenario happens and they don't tender me a 100% offer. After all they gave me a conditional offer before today's crap went down that was just dependant on the references/background check and as I don't lie on my applications/resumes it should be fine. The only thing I'm really worried about really is my credit, but should that even be an issue for clerical temping? I'm probably just being paranoid it's probably be just fine. I hope.

"event","<p>a little bit of happyness, i don't know why though. =)<br /><br />and then... mum got a Wii for valentines. eh? i'm confused too. but whatever. doubt she'll end up playing it much after the initial new-ness of it. this is exactly like the nintendo that dad bought her, i ended up having it... or i persuaded her into buying games that she'd want to play, and then i played with them. hahaha =)<br /><br />sleeeeeeppppp.<br /><br />s2</p>"

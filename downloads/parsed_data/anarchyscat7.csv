"event","So i'm trying to learn Latin while i can't sleep, lol and i fell in love with this phrase b/c it is so true, especially for me, my conscience is very important to me and plauges me whenever i do anything so i guess its a good thing b/c it keeps me honest lol. But then again i don't really have a reason to be dishonest just now. hahaha 
The phrase means ""My conscience means more to me than all speech."" 
Also saw the new HBO miniseries on Elizabeth the First and loved the line about what women hate, which is of course liars. Ahhh such a great woman. lol and now with some sources from Sussex provided by the wonderful as always jack i now have 38 pages of just info to use for a possible future masters or phd thesis! Yay all i have to do is write around it so i can flesh out all the info i drone one about for 38 pages lol. ahhhh i get to see Jack in approx 21 days!!!! muahahahhaa 

I decided not to see that other guy Lee, its not like it would be cheating (though it would feel like it to me) but seriously i'm still in Ky for the moment, he's in Miami and even though i'll be doing a photo shoot in Miami this weekend i just don't have the energy to deal with a man that's not jack, a man who doesn't sound, act, or anything like jack. uh oh i've fallen for the british man, but then again i already knew that! And what did i think was going to happen in miami? That i would feel like i had options in case jack doesn't work out, that i would remove the pressure of jack by going out with another guy, am i so in need of attention? This all goes back to that quote and my conscience using my own feelings of guilt b/c i was brought up never to do something to someone that you wouldn't want done to you, i mean i would feel guilty, and like such a bitch. Also i have to keep focus on the fact that i want to continue to be the person i see myself as, ie not a bitch, not a cheater, not fickle and etc. Though sometimes being ""good"" does have its drawbacks...like this guy is hot and i shouldn't have guilt or regret over a fling when jack and i still aren't together and he can't voice the words in an actual sentence lol. Can you feel guilt over doing something that isn't bad? What the hell is wrong with me? I've got way too many loyalty issues, loyalty is very important to me especially since i've had psychotic abusive cheating bfs in the past. Perhaps that's the reason?

Oh and get this Coast Guard Lee is a Pysch major...who's getting his PHD lol i do not need him in my head, or as a reference case study ever! Plus Jack is older and i do have a thing for older men.... :) But then again 27 isn't that old hahahaha. 

ok back to my paper and my latin studies!"

"event","Sad that Keeneland is now closed, it was a fun season lots of horse races (thankfully i wasn't there the day they had to put down that one horse...it was so sad. :( but other than that incident the party was the shit)
Man i haven't drank that much since the fashion show and the last 4th of July lol, and before that i haven't drank that much since i was out at sandbar with D and that asshole put something in my drink (tox report! gahhh) and i ended up in the hospital not only with a severe hangover but groggy drug haze and a minor concussion from when i fell down (when i passed out in hecht lobby and had to go for a ride in the ambulance) booooo my third least fav college memory...the other two i think are obvious to anyone who knows me.
But seriously who puts shit in drinks like that? Also i didn't know initially that there was a Rohyptnol and thought that i was just drunk out of my mind from having 4 category fives at Sandbar, but thanks to the hospital they've cleared that up lol...but i've had 3 Cat Fives since then in sucession and didn't have the same prob so i guess it really was the drug...but now i'm paranoid and was really worried about that when i was bartending b/c they kept buying me drinks too and you gotta keep the customer happy. I was concerned until i remembered that it wasn't the alcohol last time. And i did drink way more than that at last year's 4th of July celebration muahahahaha. So i relaxed and drank the day away basically i think i had an impressive
3 amaretto sours
2 lemon drops
1 apple martini
1 margarita
2 cranberry and vodka (my fav drink) lol i think that was quite enough alcohol for one day and then i cut myself off at 2pm b/c seriously i needed to be able to mix the drinks and not have a dazed and buzzed expression on my face lol. 
Maybe Pedro was right i don't have a prob with alcohol i just like to be drunk...therefore i'm a drunk not an alcoholic....lol. Weird terminology i know but oh well.  But then again i only get ""off my ass drunk"" every four months or longer hmmmm so i guess i'm not good at being a regular drunk perhaps i need to drink more often?  i like social drinking but sometimes you just need to be drunk! Like after a breakup, during a bad relationship, during a really bad movie (lol) or during a class you wish would just end! 

I do have one friend who is an alcoholic i mean this person who will remain nameless but i think we can all guess who it is lol has a set of 3 shot glasses in his glove compartment and a bottle of tequila! The same person who convinced me to drink 30 shots of tequila to win a shot contest....(note i am never going to do that again...talk about thinking you're going to die!!).  

Also i got a phone number....from a guy named Lee in miami who is only going off my myspace profile pic....and thinks i'm pretty and we've been talking back and forth rather innocently the last couple of days but he wants to go out for drinks...hmmm should i? should i go out for drinks with a cute guy who works with the coast guard or is that wrong b/c of jack? i mean jack and i aren't together yet, i want us to be but the man is so damn shy he can't muster up the courage to say ""hey i like you let's go out"" but he's pining for my ass and his friend declares he's in love with me and even forwarded me an email jack sent him discussing how much he is in love with me. I just don't know why he can't say it himself...i think i'm making it clear that he won't be rejected i'm not one for ""hard to get"" games, i hate games! 
bleh maybe i will go out, i haven't been out on a real date in a long time. It would be nice and he seems funny and sweet....and cute he is my type tall and blonde! lol i need to go to bed i ramble on and on at 4am.....so hopefully this post isn't just a string of random nothings that make no sense. 

Also saw the movies Red Eye, Walk the Line, Intermission (hilarious), and finally Lord of the Rings 3 (longest and often the most unintentionally funny movie ever!) good times i especially liked in Walk the Line when June Carter helped him get off drugs and the way she did it. Red Eye good thriller with impressive eye candy, Intermission was as hell...who puts brown sauce in tea? i mean that shit is nasty! And i think LOTR3 was eh...except for Viggo getting with Liv Tyler's character in the end that made the movie for me....i almost cried! 

Oh yea today is the 7th month anniversary of Ernie's divorce!!! and in two weeks the seventh month of my sis's marriage to my fabulous brother in law who is currently scheduling time to work on THE Hubble!!!! that's right baby THE one and only Hubble!!!! woot!"

"event","Ok so now i've been asked to submit some photos i've done for this art exhibition in Paris due in 2007....when i say i'm a lucky bitch i mean it!!!! But there is also the strong possibility that none of my photographs will be chosen for the show but that's ok b/c even if i don't get chosen i still sent them in and often the best things in life are the most risky. But if i do get chosen then party in Paris with a bunch of photographers and being part of a real art show!!!! giggles! But i won't know til september....if you want to know what i'm submitting im me or email me and i will show my three shots. :)

Thanks and a shout out to J's friend aka pentagon boy lol for helping me recover some information/emails off my email. you are the shit! and i think its cool that you read this blog too! But these things needed to be recovered just in case. :) 

Thank god that Homeland security guy that liked me isn't (so far) implicated in some crazy pedophile sex scandal!!!! 

I have such a dirty mind! lol but that's another story for when i stop blushing about it...ernie and i were discussing our fav sex moments and surprisingly Matt had most of them and ernie teased me without mercy saying i haven't had good sex for over 3 years now lol. However that guy i fooled around with last Dec wasn't bad but i didn't want to start anything serious with him b/c of jack (whom i am still not official with but hopefully will be when i get over there!) and i bet jack is fantastic. or at least i hope so. But anyways Ernesto (this was yesterday by the way) starts saying very loudly in our bar that i need to get laid properly and british style (which means uncircumsized lol) devilish little man. But then again i wonder if he is uncut? Like i said i have a dirty mind. I bet he's gonna blush when he visits that new freelance job i'm working on hahahhahahahahaha my poor shy british who is def not as innocent as he may look, its just part of his british charm. lol

Ok so Canada and new york for Box five productions! woot next week i won't be updating i will be out for a spell, i've never been to Quebec before and nor have i been to new york so i'm gonna have to call D's mommy!!! yay hehehehe just to say hey. But in Canada my cell prob won't work but its ok b/c i think my boy roomie is pretty cool and we got along great last time. :) Jack didn't like that i slept in the same room with some random guy named blake but he'll get over it lol, we had separate beds! 

alright methinks i will chill awhile and go to bed. I also found the perfect design for the tattoo i want....one is the pic you see on this page and the other is a sign to ward off evil people. Something i need desperately! I've run into some really shitty people...well only two people were really shitty and one of those guys was just a douche bag with a loud mouth and not violent, some were weird but not evil only two so far. lol but hopefully that will stop....cause next time i will be going forward with charges.

PS This weekend is not weepfest 2006 it is SniperFest! 2006 kicking off tomorrow at 3pm (me, hueb, ernie and possibly high school friends if they could stop being such idiots towards each other!) with the professional aka Leon (the most badass movie ever and i must say i have quite the crush on gary oldman in that movie) then the playlist will have
Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells (ok so not about snipers but guns are involved, its really an action movie weekend with the name SniperFest)
The Long Kiss Goodnight
Saving Private Ryan
SWAT
Dirty Harry
La Femme Nikita
Femme Fatale
Kill Bill Vol. 1
Kill Bill Vol. 2
Collateral
Agents Secrets
and possibly more but my brain is leaking....night!"

This is a freelance gig too, but if it takes off hey i'll always have a fall back in case Vogue doesn't hire my ass permanently...lol.
lol, i'll be in the Britain station for this mag.
I'm very excited! It's like a classier playboy almost hehehehe and there are other benefits as well like toys i get to have b/c i'm on set damnit! muahahhahaa i'm one lucky bitch! Also this mag is starting up, so its kinda new but it does have support from a business group the CEO for IT or whatever the hell that is called. lol oh well i can't wait to start both my new jobs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone want to come to London and work with me too? I get to recruit personal staff...and don't worry its not like i'd actually make any of you work. Ernesto says he wants to do it just to be around semi-nude women posing in VS-esque lingerie hahaha. Silly, horny, newly single Ernie wants to play the field (well not newly single but less than a year since his divorce kicked in!)

"event","Detroit was a blast! got really good at taking pics of people flipping and jumping through the air, i feel confident now that i could work for espn and gymnastics! lol but seriously i'll put up some of the pics on myspace as soon as i'm given the hard copies to scan. in one weekend i took 25,000 photos! woo hoo and made them a lot of money (so they said) and the next gig is in Canada! yay i'm excited haven't been to Canada before but if it is as fun as Detroit i'll be very happy. lol Jack was a little scared about me being in Detroit but after emailing him and telling him we'd be in a posh section he said ok, but i think its adorable how he worries! :) he's very cute. 
I saw V for Vendetta and it was awesome, couldn't see it before has had planned but i am so hyped about this movie i could sing its praises for years, not only politically, but artistically as well. It was a revolutionary movie that is so true on so many levels that i can hardly contain myself. As my brother in law said ""kickass"" lol. awesome!
Ok i'm going to go back to watching one of my fav romanctic movies Romancing the Stone b/c its a good time for those of us that enjoy the occasional sappy hopeless romantic fantasy movie. I'm such a romance whore! MMMMmmmmmmmmm Michael Douglas...young!
But i did watch Closer again tonight and i must say i do love that movie!
And Elizabeth 1st comes on HBO on April 19th woo hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Also i put together my conversations i had been having with this guy, and Jack and Matt about Elizabeth the 1st my eternal obsession and my answer to them on whom i would go gay for lol, turn out i have 38 pages double spaced in a 10pt font of only information and sources and not a word of my opinions so i could make this my thesis! Woo Hoo i could get a phd!!! that would fuckin rock! Hmmm i've already been accepted to NYU and have deferred my enrollment so after Vogue (and hopefully with the option of a full time position if i returned/when i returned please god let them offer me a permanent position) maybe i'll go get my PHD in History, then if i ever needed a break from being an artist i could join Jack a Uni and teach! muahahhahahaha but only if it works out between him and me otherwise no. but i hope it does!
ok tomorrow's sched:
watch P&P, Eliabeth, and must stop watching the Professional obsessively i've seen this movie a hundred times at least since 1994 but i can't stop its addictive!

other than that i'm too tired to give details. laters"

"event","New Passport Pics!!! yes they look good this time! lol my last ones did much to destroy my vanity. muahahahahha the weight loss continues i've lost five more lbs! yay i'm getting skinny again....and thank god my breasts continue to shrink as do my thighs lol. 
Jack is in good spirits despite papers he has to write but i actually helped him find sources and looked over for info in some of the books we both have. :) yay i'm helpful. Also am seeing the Libertine with the incomparable Johnny Depp and fellow Kentuckian tomorrow with my sister as her 28th b-day will be upon us shortly (Sunday) as she gasps at beauty of Depp and i drool over him and his historically lecherous character....Lord Wilmot an Earl of Rochester in the Restoration period....or for non history buffs post Cromwell when Charles 2nd regained the throne and Wilmot (before disfavor) was one of his favorites and friends though a debaucher at heart....oh to be alive and fornicating in the 1600s...and yes i did just write that! lol i would totally do it just to get at the dresses but one day i will happily buy one...i mean after all my sis did buy a true southern belle gown and all the trappings that go with it and wears it occasionally! I want an Elizabethan and Restoration style dresses. 
Then after that we intend to go see V for Vendetta!! yay i am so excited i'm been wanting to see this movie for a long time, and i've even been debating with people who call him a terrorist that the founding fathers of this country could very well be called terrorists too...plus the govt in this movie/graphic novel isn't exactly the most democratic govt or socialist govt i've ever heard of especially since Britain is socialist under its constitutional monarchy. 

The time is near at hand to go to NYC to present R and i am so nervous, but have run through the presentation, and i feel kind of sick and wonder if my images and story boards are enough to go with the script...boo i hate being nervous and i love the fact that i own this piece of work through copyright and etc but i am not loving the idea of giving her up and possibly having her bastardized....but hey i'm hoping they'll keep me for the filming! muahahahhaha i want so badly to go to Africa! Not sure if they'll take R but the ""buzz"" has been good so maybe *crosses fingers* Though the filming might not take place for a year b/c of scheduling i've been warned, so maybe what they've heard and read so far (you have to mail the script to an agent so they can read it after they've agreed to represent you, and they pitch around the possibility of a script for it w/ the idea) is good enough to warrant ""buzz"" who knows? i'm nauseated, nervous, and in general panic i'll throw up on someone! This time i hope that the meeting isn't post-poned again even though i called for the last postponement (how is this spelled? gahhh i need spellcheck). lol oh well must think happy thoughts...while being realistic and non expectant...hell they could buy it for a dollar and i'd be pleased just to be out there! hmmm maybe not for a dollar though. lol But then again it is like i always say and is from one of my fav novels ""i expect nothing, only hope."" The Joy Luck Club god i love that movie.


I was just laughing at the idea that someone got a restraining order against Paris Hilton....and how easily it was done..either she showed up to court like she was summoned to do or the guy filed ex parte and had witnesses to the fact that she had been harassing him. Suddenly i realized as my last letter to the court explained that had i known about ex parte before hand i would have filed that way....as i, the police, the Dean of student's office, Fletch (i should call him too i haven't seen him since he took that new job lol but he's so sweet and nice and Layla is a great gf for him!!! She's the less abrasive counterpoint that he def needed) and the hospital agree that i have enough evidence to lock his sorry ass up and at the very least get a restraining order (some of this info is in the private journal entry i previously wrote...but needs saying here b/c there's no other personal info here :) ) ex parte.  
So in short i would have a full year long order if i had filed that way. Too bad i didn't but at least all the temp ones allowed me to have peace of mind and sleep at night.

Also if you ignore a judges summons...even if in a letter (as i've stated before)you explain you cannot get there it doesn't look good on you. If you're innocent you go and defend yourself but in this case he cannot say he is innocent as everyone could tell and be a witness to court if necessary.  It doesn't matter if you can't really afford to get some place you have to show up, and all those other lies he told also don't make him look very good, the bailiff even said as much. Dean Sandler said that his past manipulative behavior coupled with the email and instant messenger threats of death and his suicide were enough to get him convicted of at least aggravated assault and battery if not the abuse which the hospital could back up for a full on assualt charge.

So ends that downer......just had to say it again b/c i thought the Paris Hilton thing was funny, but then again she actually showed up for court (i believe) b/c otherwise you acn't get a restraining order unless its filed so that the other person doesn't have to be in the court with you...which i should have done. :)
ok til next time...when i only tell tales of Ernie and me going hither and dither and movie opinions!
cheers ya'll (an expression of country bumkinness while being slightly assimilative towards British culture!) lol"

"event","I am Jane Austen's slave....well not really but as a fellow Sagitarius i feel that she and i can identify a lot with one another, and her works are so funny and romantic that i have loved her sense laying my hands on my first copy of Pride and Prejudice when i was 12, the brillaince of it can hardly be described in a way that will do it justice! I have since then read all her works, except Sanditon b/c it was not finished by her and i cannot accept another writer in her place.  :)
Obsessive...yes i'm well aware of that. My sister and i were talking about her works and she likened me to Elizabeth Bennet and Marianne Dashwood (yay) and said that i have had my Wickam/Willoughby and now must find my Darcy/Brandon to be with forever and to find romance, rapture and delight in a man worthy of love and loving. We're such romantics. But who could not be with such lives as we have led? Surely we would not have had so many trials if there wasn't something better down the road for us! I'm a little Pollyanna these days, b/c i feel that the magic of love and being swept off my feet will happen b/c now i'm not going to settle for just anyone like i did with the last two bfs including pyscho and Matt, but the only way i'm going to be with someone forever is if i get the fairytale i deserve and have longed for my whole life. My story so far has fairytale like qualities....girl goes through trials of sadness, meets a horrible man who hurts her but she prevails in the end to meet the hero and be rescued by him not only physically but mentally as well b/c he helps her realize so much through his love. Alright i've realized my cynical ass just went pollyanna but i can't help it, i'm in a good mood and i have been in a good mood since i got the first restraining order! :)

Well kiddies in an attempt to get over to england for vogue, my new start date *after all paper work is done* is May 1st :) I cannot wait, i love the idea of an internship, but i have decided to take a full time insurance job/media job or any job that this company places me with! woot woot. i'm  excited about that as well, cause any setup help i can get is appreciated! And also i can make the internship part time as well....i mean seriously how many photographs can one person be taking/proofing/grabbing coffee(?)/editing/setting up equipment shots and etc?  Well decided is a strong word, but we'll see!  But i am so grateful to them for changing the date of my internship and being patient with me, i knew they liked my portfolio but i was unaware of how much they do like me! I mean to be so patient just makes me feel overwhelmed by happiness....and yes i cried like a little girl when i found it all out. oh happy day.

My UK journalism friend Allie will be helping me set up in my apartment, though she will have to drive in from Glouchestershire *hope am spelling that right....* Also my three natives *formerly known as my imports (including the now famous among my friends Jack, who was my valentine hehehehehe) and i am now their ""yankee import"" or ""the symbol of colonial agression's realization of the wrong they have committed against the former empire of Britain"" lol Dude this is so awesome, i again say i cannot wait, but they're taking me out to dinner after we've dropped off my stuff *must remember to book flight for a weekend or something of the like* and have a jolly good time!
hurrah i am not a love pariah! Nor am i any longer a magnet for emotional and psychological abusive fuckwits!!!!!!

Also good news on the weight front! I have lost 15lbs and now weigh in at (though not as good before whole pyscho ex-bf situation) 147lbs no joke either certified by doctors visit, my goal is to get back to the weight that i was during the time i was dating Matt (i should call him, it has been two weeks since i've talked to him!) 120! My clothes don't fit in that wonderful damnit they're so big on me now great way! My breasts are shrinking too, thank god i was so tired of them being so big! 
But i am happy that i can say i am not being anorexic again, i'm just going swimming and jogging again one or the other every day, so its not that hard to see how its come off.  I'm five feet nine inches and i want my old weight back again...i've gained way way too much weight even though it did give me larger breasts and the appearence of hips...but seriously i hate being fat. And let's face it i was and sort of still am fat.
I've realized that i've only stepped out of my dating pattern the one time(by dating pattern i mean someone who looks like a guy i would find handsome like Daniel Lepaine, Val Kilmer, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Jude Law...i mean i have dated a male model before people, though he was a douche bag lol and not as funny as the Homeland Security guy), and i paid dearly for it, it turns out that i downgraded to V when i dated him, which is sad really and my sister is right once you look at him (outside of the abuse/psychotic tendencies) he's not handsome....anyways enough of that just have to remind myself never to go out with someone whom is not handsome, not funny, and certainly not nice ever again! In short no more downgrading....and obviously Jack is not a downgrade but in so many more ways than just looks too, he's almost too perfect and i can't wait to enjoy his flaws, let's just hope he'll like mine as well...but we seem to be getting on rather well. It's so nice to know for certain that someone likes you and wants to be with you and won't treat you like shit. i'm almost afraid to believe in it for fear that my hopes will be dashed and that i've raised him on some sort of pedestal...hmmm need to make a con list for him (ernie's idea) so i make sure he's not lifted too high in my eyes).


I must look my absolute best for new job, new man, and new country! 
Plus as Ernesto said this past V-day when we went out together for a ""thank God i'm sort of single/divorcee-boy screw valentine's day drink fest"" he said ""you look hotter than a naked jalepeno."" lol he's too funny, i know he's kind of lying cause he's so much like my brother that the realization of that statement is sort of putrifying...but we'll wait til i get to my goal weight before i think that....it's nice though to be reassured by your platonic soulmate.  His now ex wife called him while we were at the bar and grill that is actually called the Red Saddle Saloon hahhahaha and he looked miserable so i answered it (i took it outside) and said ""ohhh honey come back to bed someone's on the phone for you."" to which i think she started cursing at me, but i can't speak German so it doesn't matter and then i said ""oh he can't come to the phone right now, but you know how you always ""worried"" about us? well a cheater would know another one by sight right? and then i hung up on the lying cheating bitch! muahahahaa 
Lying cheating abusive bitches are the worst! 

What else is happening...not too much, just paperwork, job, freelance stuff (yay Aussie t-shirt Co is coming about)
Also trying to organize a nationwide gay rally with my gay husband is hard, b/c he lacks concentration and conviction, so apparantly i'm doing all the work in his name...damnit! But anyways i'm so happy Dr. G said he would help out any way he could, he's so fantastic! 

Reminds self to email Walt and Tom (just to say hey b/c they are the two coolest art profs i've ever had!)
Got a cool email from Dr. L in Italy!!! he's having fun perusing docs from the 17th century, lucky devil i would love to look at docs while sipping wine, emailing my students to make them jealous of everything i'm doing especially the view. Note to self: get Jack to take a mini-break to Italy with me! lol

Also i'm trying to hook my sister up with this publishing company and their children's book division that i know and have contacts with b/c she is writing her own children's book!!! And i'm illustrating it! yay Huebie! 

Dreamworks is still a go, now that not only have i copyrighted R(its been C'd for over a year now!) drawn everything, researched to the nines (despite a psychos obvious attempt to make me believe that i know nothing, obviously he didn't understand that i am a history major, as well as an art major mainly Colonial, Elizabethan and Middle Ages as my areas of specialization...but i've now read 8 books on Africa and know the history rather well for the limited info there is on African history for the period of study i am interested in! However i am a historian and know a helluva lot more than he ever will about any time in history b/c of my dad, a history teacher, and my own studies....plus i am way more intelligent than him too......3.52 GPA bitches!! hehehe despite having a grand total of 8 surgeries while at UMiami, the five on my arm, appendicitis, two laperscopies and dealing with one psycho). *grins*  Certified by my transcript finally getting here! woo hoo Yes Yes i only now wish i didn't turn down the opportunity to type up a paper and graduate with honors, damnit! oh hindsight how you taunt me!

Ahhh i'm proud but also kind of sad at the thought that now that R is finished once i give her away she'll have to be taken care of by some other person. But it doesn't matter, all will be well! But as Hemingway said ""what is moral is what makes you feel good."" Or very near that quote is what he said. lol
Next i have to copyright all my other stories too, but what i truly want is to be a photographer and capture beauty, be an illustrator an tell stories with the way i draw. i want to be an artist, art is why i get up in the morning, its why i wake up in the middle of the night to paint until dawn, i feel very passionate about art, there is a fire inside of me that feels like its going to burst sometimes when i can't immediately go to a canvas when i have an idea....the reckless restless realization that my soul is at the very least tormented.....perhaps one of the girls from my floor is right...i'm very nearly Van Gogh lol. I think being a good artist means you may not always be creating something but your brain is always keen to find something to create, like it bristles with anticipation for that spark of imagination/inspiration that will burn quickly through the synapses, but until then it is dormant...like a fire barely crawling on my brain, ignited but not too loud. i am in love with art, and i hope that good luck will find me, that love and art will find me and allow me to express it *at a hopefully decent price so that i am not starving and depressed anymore like i was when i was 16 and then again when i dated that pyscho* hopefully having been through so much something good will happen now. 98 four leaf clovers cannot be for naught right? I may need therapy after all.  Only three friends know the extent of what has happened, and i'm sure they wish they didn't remember the details (which is why i made a few entries for friends only or private) b/c i don't want everyone to know all about that, its too much information and i have pride issues....i mean i won't even let people help me when my heart prob acts up...lol i'm stubborn and prideful. A red haired mule.

But anyways that was depressing so i've come up with Britt and Ernie's guide to being drunk at a bar with 50 year old men:
1) Do not wear a short skirt to show off legs when the population of the bar consists only of senior citizens....note i do not want any of them for a sugar daddy.

2)Don't answer your cheating ex-wife's call...let your female friend do it....outside, talking about sex.

3)Chicken Run is even better while drunk...and the movie commentary by catcalling old men is pretty damn funny as well, although not entirely sure why the Saloon would be showing this movie. Seriously what the hell?

4)Always sing....b/c nothing says VDay like drunken ""catterwalling"" by a country singing senior caught on Video for future replays of pleasure *i am being serious this dude could sing! old style country too*

5)Watching Cold Mountain with platonic soulmate day after VDay and realizing that the scary albino guy is actually charlie hunnam and do not feel freaked out anymore by being attracted to creepy albino guy lol. Though Ernie still states that this reflects my taste in men or my ""bad boy"" fetish....i do not have it...i think it was b/c he's a very cute crazy albino, just a malicious combination of rage and cruelty that i find attractive in a man...as long as it doesn't stem towards women but only those ""bad guys"" like the albino guy is alan rickman to a bruce willis...i love alan rickman, maybe i am sick.....hmmmm must work on that....but perhaps i'm thinking that that type of guy wouldn't do that to me, or i could change him? hmmmmmmmmm probably could provided he wasn't clinically diagnosed with some pathological lying schitzo-psycho manic-depressive disease like the ex.....so all in all does not reflect my taste in men.....wheeeew was worred about that for a full minute lol. Luckily Jack doesn't have a mean bone in his ovelry shy british body...and that body is gorgeous too! mmmmmmm...and also previous bfs i'm still friends with, and i can't wait to see Jack (i know i keep saying it but we've not seen each other in such a long time that the closer it gets to launching the more anxious i am getting)
think will have fabulous dreams tonight....albino confederate soldier....jude law is obviously required in dreams such as this as well....and of course my dashing British/Union soldier come to rescue me from the south....is it sad that i know so much about history now that any dream i have is infiltrated by a time period? I didn't think so either *wink and a grin*  And Ernesto says this is better than my ""old man fetish"" or the creepy way i find christopher walken, val kilmer, and willem dafoe sexy as hell.

6)Ernesto is fun to party with, went out last night to that guy's place where the Derby party was held, the guy that jeff knows and hung out there and danced most of the night....still tired from it but i'll live. 

7) i'm never drinking six tequila shots in a row without a lime every again, i almost got sick. Guess i'm not as young as i used to be. lol So i recommend to always use a lime.

8) When you're drunk you're no longer able to say the full names of drinks example: apple martini becomes...apnatimi and etc. It's rare that i drink this much (owing to the lack of civilization out here in the boone docks but hey the boone docks are entertaining) 

9) Ernesto would like to say that licking him is always acceptable. lol....true he'll take it from anyone.

10) Partying in a small town or a big town is basically the same...though Louisville is much more exciting than Mt. Sterling. 

11) Taking a call from Larry is not a good idea! lol especially not when Ernesto take it from my hands and asks if he wants to talk to my british boyfriend. lol Though Jack and i aren't official yet i have to move there first...but still we are almost official...does that make sense? i've left the initial point of this list...in manner of Melville tangent.  



Oh yea side note on where my historical love comes from....found out that in 1282 on my birth date two of my family members one tipton for england, williams for wales fought to protect the last welsh king ever, killed the tipton knight in front of the king and was knighted on my b-day and then the tipton knight's brother Sir G Tipton beheaded my relative (but he already had kids obviously, oh and the tipton knights are my mom's side of the family) and killed the welsh king for england! Ahhh i love history and apparantly my Sir Edward Williams was an illegitmate great (great? confused on how many greats) grandchild of William the Conqueror (he favored his bastards by giving them titles and lands in many places) let's see logically 1066-1080s, children.....so prob great to some power grandchild. I'll have to look that up if i have spare time, we have the family tree chart from the Ky historical society who traced and authenticated everything...isn't it interesting the things you find out, that happened in 1995 and i've been in love with history ever since.




Well this was excessively long.....b/c that is what happens when you don't do a journal entry for a long while.
later,
Britt"

"event","and all i could think was the ""husband"" was hot and kind of looks like jack! lol......
Also wanted to say that i feel bad for not talking to all of my friends as much recently...b/c i haven't been online and etc but i'm gonna try to call soon...though some of your emails i don't have! lol just screen names.
hmmmmmm  also hey to some old friends who became new friends recently...or not really recently and to some of the friends i barely talk to but still can't control myself and end up being nice to them...they don't read this blog nor do they have the address. I feel kind of bad keeping up a facade just so i don't hurt their feelings, even writing on their blogs that i miss them....when i really don't, but i still feel like i'm being mean if i don't talk to them, and sometimes i do miss them but not all the time.  
It's like we were friends last year but then it went south and now its just weird, and the only contact we have is on myspace......but whatever (plus this friend doesn't like a couple of my other friends and i don't know why, well one i do know why but that reason is retarded!).
its all very highschool.

On to other things.....it is snowing here and we're now trapped inside together as a family while my mom helps me fill out visa forms and other crap and over looking apartment pictures for the london move it seems so strange that its going to happen, it may take a couple of months but it will happen! i'm so excited as soon as the visa forms are filled out and sent off i'm telling jack and i hope he'll be as happy as me, heehehheehe i hinted at it the other day and he seemed enthused about it. i'm happy that he wants me to be there too! then we can be serious, and i'll have a real boyfriend who is nice and sweet and not abusive and psychotic. Then my friends can visit me and jack! hehehehehe IN LONDON!!! then on weekends (as he is still at cambridge and can't afford to take a train or car down to london every day and etc and i can't either b/c of my job) he and i can go to parks, watch him play rugby ( i think he does...but i'm not sure he mentioned a team and i don't know rugby at all...but am willing to learn) go to museums, parties, meet his parents, and i can see what cambridge looks like! I tried looking him up on their website but he's not listed, he laughed when i said that and said he didn't like prank calls since he is a TA as well as student. :) he's so beautiful and shy and sweet. i really think i could fall for this one, and that if he and i get together then i can have what heather and jeremy have! That would be perfect.

oh well hugs to all my friends...and i will call soon! It seems weird not being at the library too i kind of miss it.  *grins* but not the students!"

"event","Yes yes kiddies i may be crossing the atlantic ocean (and no not just as a visit to jack...though that obvious bonus is amazing) but i've been offered photog jobs at two magazines one in London...and one even further out in Sydney Australia!!!!!! i'm so excited, but must first make money so i can actually go there, i have a little savings enough maybe to get me there and rent an apartment for two months and then i would be payed weekly at 25 per hour at a full time job with benefits! gahhh i want to go sooooo bad, but i haven't told jack yet b/c i'm afraid it will fall through and then he'll be like why'd you get my hopes up? But more on that later, as soon as i figure it all out.

Funny news: Ernesto decides to go to church, a cathredral (we'll just say europe lol b/c there are few enough Catholic churches in that country so people would figure out which one he was in) drunk! Thus he got kicked out for it, lol and he said ""what better time to go to confession than when you have no inhibitions as to what your sins are and to make sure you spill all the beans!"" lol he's hilarious, i love you! 


Other news:Jack is being adorable (though stil shy) spicy chicken good, snow storm very fun, sledding is awesome! snowfights are even better, riding a horse is even more fun in the snow, my hair is finally shoulder length again! yay!! red as ever, even more so now that i'm out of the sun that bleaches it blonde.  
Pushed back my meeting with dreamworks until Feb 11th (hehehehe i can't wait but with the rewrite for copyright going through its legal phase lol i had to push it back luckily they seem interested and now have an agent with the Writer's guild!!! yay!!! ahhhh the fun!

Oh yea Ernesto and i had a theory on bees: that they are masturabating on the flowers and taking their jizz back to the hive where it becomes honey....and then i said hands down best tasting jizz ever (yes we're very immature and slightly disgusting but what else do you really say when you're ""slightly"" drunk and on the phone that late at night?
Then we talked about my fav tasting cum from ex's and it turned out to be once again Pedro, which was my favorite last year when i talked that random chick in the elevator lol. Ahhh pedro you were good for something....well besides the revenge fuck when i found out that douche of an ex was cheating on me, and then i subsequently ditched his cheating ass the next day....and then all that other shit happened and we won't go into it again. :) 

Sorry for the over exposure kids.....but some times Ernesto and i talk about our sex lives which i might add is going well for him, kudos to the threesome with the two french chicks the other night, one helluva party you hound! *wink*

Oh yea to my previous disturbing rant on my past, i've made that private now thinking it works better as a diary entry than as something i want everyone to know, cause most of that stuff was pretty hurtful, but in talking with the doctor recently he explained to me what was in there and it turns out that it really was a false + and there was nothing in the ""sac"" nothing at all, so all that trauma was about something that never truly existed (well the sac was there but there's a 2% chance that that will ever happen to a woman and i'm thankful to God that that was what happened to me, if it had a been a real + i would have been devastated).  Yay turns out that a lot of angst i had was for nought! whatever i'm 200% happier now that i was a couple of months ago! 
And i'm glad i have now told jack everything, and you know what i've never met a man more supportive! He called me to make sure i was ok, i mean its not everyday that a guy whose liked you for three + years calls you from england to make sure you're ok! i don't think i've ever been in love like this before, and the only other person i've ever truly loved was jason! a favorite quote i have from the movie Closer is "" i would have loved you, forever"" delivered by Natalie Portman to Jude Law was what i could have felt for vince, but he ruined it, and any loving feelings i had for him are dead and i realize i never really loved him, but i would have, though he would have never made me happy. But yes Jack's voice is every bit as deliscious as i remember it! hehehehe so sexy, accent is gorgeous!  I hope i don't jinx him, but so far he's fantastic! He has the same voice almost as jack davenport from pirates of the carribean!

Poor thing though, he doesn't know that i know what matt said, so hopefully my friend Allie in the UK won't tell him that i know, and totally screw up his snail paced activity though i think recent events are working out very well for me! But shhhhhh no telling him that i know what he said!! hehehehe it really is all very 5th grade, but hey if he doesn't want me to know at the moment....then i'll pretend to be surprised!

You're Beautiful-James Blunt

anyways i'm excited about the move! so much to do, and i must have my passport renewed but that's also another story involved with certain people *winks again* muahahahahaha :)
Note to self renew license as well! :P  ooops

i still have to make that list of things to do in Miami before graduating....ya know the mad dash stuff that's so cunning it is fascinating while semi humiliating too. hahahahhaa
ok i'll update that later.

I was watching the movie Sliding Doors last night/this morning and i love that movie, her wanker bf cheats on her and eventually she meets a nicer guy who happens to be British...see where i'm going with this! :)

Oh yea i think i forgot to mention the other day that i ran in to a few law students that were down at family court who remember me and pretty hot looking in a suit...bad Britt think only thoughts of Jack lol. :p I'm so smitten with that boy, but he's shy as hell so things are moving at the pace of a slug crossing the atlantic ocean (well he is in England).
Again i love my best friends down here, they've been through everything i've been through and sometimes worse.
I'm going to miss being in Miami for a few reasons all people and beach related....also that one drunken night that the girls and i ran into Colin Farrell and he said i had pretty hair! I have absolutely no memory of this! man i if i did though i would never feel self conscience again...b/c hello Validation! lol ahhhhh last summer...so many good times.
Beach trips, 4th of July and the drunk fireworks...., beginning of school, bloody hurricanes and the sweet ass parties that went with them. :) The fashion show that i did the shoot for (as ghetto as it was!) all the headshots/portraits, finding out i had a journalism award for graphics and photography (thanks matt we're not getting back together but giving it to me made me all fluttery about you again...handsome devil) and plus a medal for actually working on the paper! helping promoters for their clubs, and taking pics at clubs to put on websites (only did that twice, but oh well i can't party all the time) Freelancing for the Herald! woo hoo shout out to that paper. The ""missing"" fridge that unicco lost (my suitemates over the summer) and finally the most important one! The budding romance between me and the british import history major! I'm not very trusting anymore but this man does not have a violent bone in his body and sometimes i feel bad for questioning him or overreacting but hell i've been through a lot of shit so i have to take it slow. *cue usher song* lol

I'm giddy as hell right now!
Also a big surprise to be revealed later on in the next couple of weeks, and it is the best surprise ever! 
I may move to Cali, New York, or dare i say it....London! lol i can't wait!


 Fact of the day: Most domestic abuse assualts are never reported by the victim until much later when there is a breaking point.

Fun fact of the day: Ants don't like Cinnamon! yay i have a new respect for ants...although i'm allergic and they're not it's all the same to me. muhahahhaaha"

Apparantly i don't make sense, b/c a british lit prof can't think outside the box. I understand with my other profs that they can't think outside their preconceived notions of anything, however i use simple language and no real analysis for those papers, they're research papers i don't have to do that! Gahhhh i got a frickin B on that paper and now i'm pissed, i sent it to my sis who has a bachelors in english and asked her if my grammer, and language was confusing and she said no....but then again maybe she thinks too much like me and i should be more careful in my writing.
Now i'm second guessing everything...i hate this. Dr G would never give me that kind of grade! So i think i'm a good writer, but hell do i even truly care at this point i have a B all i have to do is maintain that and pass the class and i graduate, i've proven myself to be a good writer before now and i'm tired. i give up.
ok back to my bazillion other essays which i will get A's on, and A's with very little effort might i add.

The title quote is from one of my fav books The Awakening by Kate Chopin, :)

So far it looks like Cali, i might stay in miami a few months post grad just for fun, but maybe not!  Kinda tired, and have been helping kids online with research (where to look and historical stuff) its fun. Jacob says i should be a teacher (little kids or college) but i don't think so...Jack though he's going to be a prof, maybe if things get serious then my sis and i can both marry profs lol!  And Tiffany's is fantastic but lately i've been upgrading as far as men go, so no need to go back down a few notches, next to Matt i would say.  Cause we all know who the lowest position refers to. 

Oh yea Ernesto spent Halloween as a Devil, lol you know you're trying to be me! Oh and his party was apparantly kickass too, but sadly i couldn't fly over to Germany to party, will have to do that though! (since you decided to stay there and continue teaching for the rest of the year. Though who am i to refuse going to Germany? Plus hot euro men, who think i'm hot! lol, Stop showing my pic to horny Euro men, until i'm about to go over there!!!! 

Oh and i'm not really drunk but the little mood icon is too cute for words.
Beach, parties, boat, shoe shopping, and drinking looks like a fun weekend and this time i'm bringing my passport!

Oh yea i feel kinda bad that i didn't mention jack in my last entry.....but he's so pretty he's hard to forget so i was thinking about him, but then didn't talk about him.

So life is good right now, i have an Australian clothing line interested in my designs and etc. Dreamworks guy is gonna get me an interview to present my script.

Funny thing is that as long as i can remember (my first movie when i was two years old was Snow White) i always wanted to be a disney animator. I have wanted nothing more since i was 10 too. But times and jobs change and i want now to be able to be creative and hopefully one day gain access to the side of me that wants to extend that creativeness into a career beyond just a few scripts. I want to create and be apart of the process involved in making a feature film, i like designing, i like photography, i love taking photos of a person at a fashion show, photoshoot, or even just  pics for the the news, but i love more than that creating something new, a new plot (though shakespeare took all the plots lol) a new way of seeing the world and its trappings. i enjoy other things but i need to be within the process to create, if i'm harnessed i'm no good to anyone. 

I'm scared to be leaving school at the same time i'm glad its over. I miss having a boyfriend but then again i haven't had a real bf since Matt *we'll exclude vince since he's a douche* and he at least treated me right. But then this Larry thing is interesting, but then again the possibility of Kev is kinda fun and funny at the same time. Good thing professionally i'll be going by my middle name of Raine, cause not only is this a bad ass name, it is so much better than Brittany, and all the pop culture connotations that go with that name.

Lastly its nice to know that i only need to pass 1 of my four classes this semester to graduate, and i will graduate with a double bachelors of history and art, and a double minor of art history and poly sci with a total of over 150 credits!! wow i have a lot of credits! lol
i decided to stop counting after they told me this semester i had 146 credits already.

Oh well, i think the uber bitch is finally going to pay me for the photos of the fashion shoot, and now i've on all sorts of vip lists in south beach and the grove and i feel bad that i never use them, sure i'm freelance for newspapers and etc but still i don't have the energy of a freshman anymore. I'm tired, and i have no bf to speak of to take me out. I need to find a new one and fast. Cause not only do i just need to be treated like a lady i need to be pampered. lol, sounds bad but then again i'm also lonely and would settle for a snuggle buddy, lol, i've been told i'm rather unapproachable lately. Though Ernesto says that's b/c i've been hurt and am now no longer Thelma, but have emerged as Louise. I told him, that he is the only male i've ever met that has had that view on the movie and my life around, i love you Ernie!

I would also like to say that again i love my best friends Deanna, Heather, Vivi, Ernesto,Al, and Chris, you guys make every day so much easier to deal with, whether we all have drama or not, its just easier to know you guys are around and have the same stuff going on or tell me what to do. *kisses*
And when i don't see you guys often i miss you. Especially Ernesto since his ass is in Germany!! Get out, get out now man! lol remember to continue to sing ""ding dong the lying cheating ho is gone, and her broke ass is on the street."" *wink*

"event","Bah i don't know lately i've been feeling left out, and somewhat ignored. My friends are rarely around, and some of them don't invite me out anymore! i wonder why, but then i don't care half of the time, b/c if they don't want to chill then fine fuck it! i don't have time for bull like that, its not just one or two people but a lot more, i just don't understand.
One of my best friends would hang out all the time, but she's in texas with some company right now, as is my gay husband! Ernesto can't help it either he's in Germany.
But whatever....
Maybe it'll get better when i actually leave miami and go to New York or LA and get a job, i have meetings, and clients and i'm always busy, but i do make time for people whenver i can, but lately again, i've been largely ignored. Plans are rarely kept, stood up and now i'm just not gonna be available the next few days, cause i feel like sitting and pouting. 

Oh and Larry fuckhead from earlier this year, (one of my double books for Valentine's Day) sent me a pretty tiffany's bracelet, color me shocked and amazed with an apology for not coming to see me! lol, what a jackass, but hey he gives good gifts and i need some attention.

Oh well there's my whiney rant, and i'm not a happy camper, i'm slightly tired and depressed, but most of all i'm lonely and i need to find a boy soon. So hopefully people will once again be better at being friends.
later kiddies"

"event","lol....well it is true my boss, Jacob, saw me drunk.  I've decided that (and this is a lesson i should've learned when i went out with Alexis and this one guy she was dating a long time ago) i will no longer not eat dinner (actually i had had two packs of crackers total that day) and then go to a party and allow others to get me drinks, cause at the party you can't say no....well it is difficult, and then you're tipsy and there are more drinks, then you become drunk. So that was the funny part.  But not drunk enough to have a hangover, very telling of how little i drank that night.

The not so fun part was when were about to go into a club on South Beach who shall remain nameless, and i decided the best way for us to get in would be to shamelessly use my press pass (i've never done this before but i've always wanted to) the guy said yea you can go in in about five mins, well 20 mins later he passes us over for people who payed him 50 bucks a person and we were like hahaha nope gotta leave now.  OH well no press for the club, cause i would have taken a couple of pics and emailed them in due time!

Scary part, i had to find a bathroom, so Jacob, Lantz, and Nic were outside waiting for me, and i went to the bathroom in a club that let me in for free cause i have the camera, didn't even have to tell them about the press pass! yay but then i'm in the bathroom which was grosser than a wal-mart bathroom in the middle of no where, and as i'm peeing this guy busts into the stall, and grabs at my camera (around my neck) he has a knife too by the way, and my flash rips off my camera and he runs away....i was so upset afterwards and not thinking straight b/c of alcohol and trauma that i started crying, and all i could say at the time was someone took my flash.  Then i started thinking about it, but i hadn't really told anybody what happened and then i started crying, then my chest starting hurting, leave it to my heart to be a bitch in a bad situation, but due to stress i can understand why it would act up.  Stupid heart problem.  So i'm still drunk at this point too and upset.  And now i'm embarassed b/c of it, i mean such drama, i'm embarassed!  

Not embarassed about the drunk part though, b/c i've been drunk before and i have been told by jacob just now that i was funny, until my incident and heart prob, cause apparantly i scared the shit out of him and his girlfriend. :( 
I wish i had just been drunk though i'm easier to deal with when i'm drunk, barring falling down and bleeding from the head......but that was a year and a half ago. This was totally different, but i've learned my lesson, and as i think Ernesto will say, i was probably picked for potential robbery (i say potential cause i'm lucky he didn't stay in there for very long and didn't take my purse or anything like that, maybe he was nervous but i don't give a damn!!) because i was drunk. Drunk people are easier targets, and i wasn't falling down drunk, i was just a little wobbly like a weeble but i don't fall down.  Lol Jacob told me i wasn't bad i was just drunk.  hahaha oh well still embarassed though. I don't know why but i always feel embarassed when people take care of me, even when like last night i needed it, makes me feel stupid and weak and i don't like that, never have liked it either, i'm used to being the one that takes care of my friends, or at least hiding what's wrong by making a joke about it. hmmmmmmmm 

But back to the fun part of the evening, i will remember it as a mixed evening from here on out, well there were supposed to be 40 models, but there were only five.  My model eventually wasn't picked b/c there were supposed to be so many, but two of the models were not very pretty, but oh well they had the bodies for it, you know the type cocaine dieters, lol.  Also there were no celebs, the space was really small, and the organizer and host was very disorganized and you could tell she had never planned one of these things before. There wasn't even a runway! So i have eight roles of film wasted on a non fashion show with very bad lighting, after party that sucked ass, only good thing was the bartender was awesome! and the food smelled nice, but i sadly did not eat, should have but didn't. I had soooo better get paid!!!!!  I wonder what her budget is, i mean seriously what the hell?!"

"event","I was in Court this morning trying to get my restraining order to be permanent, but the judge wa sick and i had to reshcedule for two weeks from now! bah bah bah! I hate that, i wanted it to be over with, but it won't be, and if vince doesn't show up then i have to keep coming back, though he would be breaking the law by not showing up and could face jail time (the bailif told me that).

But other than that drama, which will NOT be the focus of my life:
I am shooting a fashion show tomorrow night on South Beach, and i've recruited my friend Lantz to help me out, hey we're photogs and we need money! This will look so good on our resumes!!
Plus with my t-shirt designs and company fun and etc i'm not doing so bad carreer wise.
Then in Dec i will go and present my Rawa (thank god for copyright) :)and hopefully someone will buy her and my three other scripts that i have at the moment.
And i'm deferring my NYU acceptance into Grad School for art, cause a masters in art won't help me find a better job, and i don't want to teach, but i wouldn't mind going in for my other major, History (which i love).  But we'll see!
I'm happy at the moment with the progression of my life. *grin*

Also i need to get Jack, (who is not technically cheating! yay, found that out cause he's taken to emailing me now twice a week, and Matt the friend who was concerned about it when he was seeing somebody, didn't know that his ""seeing somebody"" was me!!!!) to come back to America and do more than just kiss this time. hehehehehe
But i'm not refusing anymore dates, well the ones that i want to go on (cause its not cheating if you're not really together right? and i know he's not and wants me to do the same but i'm not sure at the moment if i accept that).  Plus i do have other options, muahahahhahaha
Hmmm what else...i want to see North Country, Into the Blue, and of course the movie about Kentucky itself Elizabethtown!!! woo hoo, i am so seeing that, love Kirsten Dunst! And Orlando Bloom isn't bad to look at either.

Lesson i learned: Respect is NOT something you earn, everyone deserves it at the beginning, but when you fuck up you lose it, and with me once you lose my respect you will never get it back.

Oh yes, i keep losing bits of weight, damn that birth control does bloat you, but now that i'm losing it, i feel better, more like the old me, pre-hatboy, i was even asked to model! (i was so excited about that, but as others know i opted for the job of taking the photos instead of being in them, though i will be in a few, cause  i'm gonna be on the website with Lantz (who's cute too by the way)). I'm thinking Knee high black boots, minidress, funky belt, my silver bangles and my newsboy hat....oh and my equipment! lol Then i'll have a new pic to email to jack!

Oh and i took this extreme sex test and apparantly i'm a kinky lady! I scored more than one of my best friends hhahahahahahhaaha. I fuckin rule! hahaha almost a pun.
ok later kiddies and get your ass to this fabulous fashion show tomorrow night at 11:30pm on the Beach!"

"event","ok, so i hadn't thought about this asshole in months..
i had forgotten that he:
lied about brain surgery  
told me i was worthless
decided to cheat on my two or was it three times
physically abused me
verbally abused me
Plus the one thing that i will never forgive him for, the ""poking holes"" thing, fuckin asshole i hope you burn in hell.
UNTIL THIS PAST THURSDAY!!! 
When i get 2 phone calls from this fucker at 430am saying he was in miami, that he wants to rape, kill and cut me up, and the kicker is he said no one would find me for a few days cause i live alone.
He repeated to me my UNLISTED phone number and address.  So i call the cops and i have police reports on him now as well. 
i have a temporary restraining order now. Have to go to court to make sure its permanent.
Cause this guy isn't going to frighten or batter me any more.
He makes me sick. i can't believe i ever let him touch me, but a lot of it was out of sympathy all the shit he said about his horrible crazy parents
he claimed his brother was a pedophile, who looked up kiddy porn regularly
said his grandfather (step) had a stroke
also grandpa was a paraplegic (sp) Who somehow managed to kick him out of the house
Anne found out that his ip address was still at the house so yea, he was lying about that too.
Also how he writes a letter to Anne telling her how he's got all these other girls on the side but he wants Crit back, when he writes similar things to me, but doesn't mention the other girls, and i'm not mentioned in the letter to Anne.....what a fuckin loser.
I hate this guy.
The police are writing it up as Aggravated Assault with stalking, plus the previous battery.

This guy is the worst kind of scum there is, not only that but he's psycho too
He also told me he's been institutionalized twice now, and this last time for Schitzophrenia and an aggressive disorder.....i agree with the last one, but personally he's more like a sociopath, you know those crazy manipulative people who are so cunning at times they have everyone else around them believing in them. And that he did. whatever, he's such a loser ass psycho.

There is good news to this week though kids....i'm shooting the runway of a fashion show the 7th...my girls are comin' with!! yay! and i'm taking more headshots of girls, (getting paid) and working freelance for a t-shirt company. So hey i'm happy about that, just nervous and scared that psycho boy is lurking somewhere here in miami.

Oh and V's bro found out FINALLY that vince was lying about brain surgery, ha wonder if that guy still thinks i'm crazy, even if he doesn't i'm not sure i care, cause if you can't see through the person you've lived with your entire life? then you're just as guilty as he is, when you could have stopped this at the first time, but he didn't. 

But i'm safe in the dorms, they have his photo and descriptions downstairs not only security but there is a special guard downstairs now, and he stays there until this shit is resolved, preferably by his ass going to jail.
People shouldn't threaten other people and expect to get away with it!

Another thing i'm glad i copyrighted my script (i only told him the basic line of the story) but i'm glad nonetheless, he's stolen enough of my art....oh yeah didn't mention that yet, well i had to tell him to remove some of my stuff from his website, cause i refuse to allow him to use my drawings to lie to the public about his ""talent.""  He already took some of my dragons for his BFA show, thankfully he paid for those though.

I'll add more later, cause seriously i can't remember all the shit he lied about to me right now."

"event","i've decided in a wild fit of folly, that i will not wait as long as i said i would to present Rawa, it has to happen fast, if i don't do something i will explode.
So my hopes were up about a guy, i even daydreamed about him, and how and what not, this was all very private only a couple of people know this.  I was happy in this dream, and b/c he's quote on quote ""seeing someone"" all this from an unknown source,(and i don't know if he's serious about her or if as Ernie would say ""is he seeing her like colin farrell sees women?"" haha i love u.
and i don't even know how he's seeing them, the boy has been traveling so much that it would seem impossible to maintain a relationship when you've only seen them may 6-7 weeks out of a year??? how is this possible!? Anyways i give up, i just want what i've wanted in the past and i would give up the possibility of ever marrying if i could just have all that. (it sounds like i'm giving my soul to the devil or something with that statement) But when you can't even trust the British!! oh well i just can't take anymore of this dissapointment timet to shut everything off for awhile....even my celeb crushes (hahahahhahahahahaha yes i have them, i think everyone knows i have this thing for val kilmer and a new one! and they're even dating people....or maybe dating people, even their sitches are ambiguous). 

But what does seeing someone mean? i wish i knew the particulars so i can just deal with this and be done with all of the stupidity of men and all that they do! i hate this. i feel like i do this everytime though, i'm getting my hopes up and then bam nothing works, so again i will not even look at guys for a long time. (Ernesto says that won't happen, cause in the morning i'll feel better and pretend i'm val kilmer's wife which i do not do, at least i haven't since i was 16!!!)  But that's the problem i get way way too involved when i can know nothing of what's happening across that goddamned pond!!  

I would also like to interject Ernie's comment ""you know it'll be all ok once you get to be a big writer and maybe even an actor in hollywood then you'll be fighting them off, and all those fuckers that screwed with you before will be regretting they weren't walking down a carpet with you on tv.""   
awwwww he's precious, i'll prob take him down the carpet if i ever get to one, b/c he's my favorite guy, the only one besides people i don't know, that doesn't piss me off so fuckin' bad right now. 
When will i get my colonel brandon!! 

oh well like i said i need to not freak out over this, deal with it, stop talking to him, once he replies to my question if he answers yes (who am i kidding if he says no he's prob lying) and i will banish him from my life, just like married guys!
But still i would like to know how this would have happened the only steady contact he's had is me and his guy friends (and i know this informat isn't talking about me, cause he knows me).


Well i had an interesting week besides all of that, my dad was having chest pains so they had to take him to the hospital and thankfully not another heartattack, but it just freaks me out.  i don't know what to do about that one. 
Today is my mom's birthday, and everyone was at the house but me, cause i'm stuck down here in fuckin miami pining away for a british guy who i haven't seen in a year and a half now, who supposedly likes me, and continues to email me, but fuck it, i am mad, and i don't think i can trust him now.
i've got to stop building people up in my head, cause they continuously let me down.
well off to work on my screenplay which i guess will just have to be the love of my life, since i'm not finding it anywhere else down here."

Well i remember this one time when my friend jendayi called me to tell me to come immediately to her room. i did, but i was reluctant cause i was tired, and come to find out that her crazy hooker like roomie had moved jendayi's prayer rug again (they had had a fight about this) and to make her point stapled HER OWN fish to jendayi's headboard.  Needless to say jendayi had the shit scared out of her. Reminds me of my ex-roomie the plus sized alcoholic stripper with the coke problem....ahhh memeories.  But we starting calling this bitch the crazy fish lady from then on.

Ok there's this obsessive really weird chick....fish....whatev, and she not only cyberstalks my friends, but cyberstalks me too, and neither of us have met this chick, she's feeling how should i say it? insecure and the bitch needs to stop.
I am not one for stalking, but when finding someone's name out just b/c they clicked on your link in your profile when you didn't know they knew your friends, just freaks me out more than a little!!!

Plus this is moving day. i hate moving, i have yet to unpack, and i don't need more stress today, i have enough of it just from the realization that i have too much damn stuff, and i prob don't need those clothes....but oh well. gah, i'm exhausted and worried that if the freak has the link then she must have read my journals....not good at all.  how much spare time can one person have?

i need a drink...

and i'm missing work tonight cause i'm soooooo tired. can't go to work and sit still for four hours, i'm gonna have a really low paycheck next time, oh well at least school's starting and i don't have to buy groceries anymore!!!

ok i'll stop bitching about my financial sitch right now! (though its not bad, i'm just not rich like a hilton....yet)

oh well i'm tired, freaked out, and so pissed right now! i'm telling you this bitch doesn't want to mess with the red headed DEVIL!!!  She has no idea how mean i can be."

"event","Ok for starters anybody who lies and cheats on D is a loser, a fuckwit, and furthermore no longer worthy of the queen of hotness!!! 
Better yet an emotional fuckwit with no class, you know i don't think there should be anymore hooking up with this jerk, and to think of ALL THE DATES you've given up out of curtesy to this idiot just makes me sad.  
Second if you're gonna lie to a girl, lie well, don't say some bull about how you don't want to hurt her, and then proceed to lie, cause you know what? that's like trying to figure out how much fuel is in a tank by using a lighter (variation on a quote by D).  
And if you're gonna mess around with other girls, the girl you were messing around with first (so far as we know) shouldn't be treated like shit! 
But then again what do you expect from a guy who likes raging illiterates, ""know what to do with the candles next time?"" BITCH please!!

But it doesn't end there, the whole i don't want a relationship guy, begins to date randomly...(though why get in a relationship to begin with if you don't want one?? i know guys are retards!!) and then says things like i hope you wouldn't be upset if she became my girlfriend. wtf????

But then again this is the Vortex, aka Miami, and it seems most guys treat women like its the paleolithic period!! Bah, this guy needs to get himself together and stop fucking around, cause it will eventually fall off!

On a lighter note.....
My thoughts on random things
1-what you thought dorm rooms had lights?
2-Drunk people happen
3-Takeout is necessary
4-you begin to think chicken really does look like that.
5-and you like it....
6-you don't remember what veggies taste like.
7-you learn how to develop school spirit mainly b/c of the vodka in your backpack!!
8-when home you want to be free and on campus...hahaha oxy-moron
9-you get drunk dialed by co-workers-what carlos doesn't know i have caller id?
10-upon finding out you're from Ky people will ask you if you know how to read. true story
11-if your bf/ex's mom doesn't like you and your hair is red, you will be called the red headed devil
12-or if you look at a holy roller wrong, you're still a red headed devil
13-Masochist-someone who wears a sweatshirt outside in Miami during August.
14-Mail often doesn't leave campus
15-Men think monogamy is a disease.
16-Cops, drug bust, overdoses, fires, robberies happen regularly, and they are called ""fire drills"" by the administration.....


New Commandment:
#11 Thou shalt not lie to thy gay husband! 

things i don't want to hear first thing in the morning! 
1-I got a nasty taste in my mouth from this guy last night.
2-Alfred the great had rectal probs (nobody else wanted to know that either!!)
3-can you identify this bug?

ewwwww"

3)There's a 80% chance it'll rain everyday....then get hotter.

4)If you have plans to go to the beach...it won't happen that day, but it will happen...3 days later making you late for work...:)

5)Going to clubs is an experience...where a small drunk cuban man will grab you and lick your face and bite your ear....then after you've slapped him will tell you that you're a sexy saucy mama...(wtf)

:)
just been having a blast lately!!!  just hanging out with my favorite people! especially D and Ernesto, and Vivi. 
woot woot party in NYC D has arrived!!!!! i don't think D has to worry about the GRE b/c not only is she wicked smart but i think psych comes so naturally to her, i mean she can analize you better than anyone and prob under a min too!!!! Which (hahaha fragments!!!) is good, i think she'll be a great psychologist!! :) i'd pay her, hee hee, 
but other than that no new updates, except that vince, my ex may be in town this weekend, and i hope not, b/c i don't want to be near him, in any way.  he scares me.  
i wish i could have that which i deeply desire. which is for Rawa to be sold, and loved, accepted, and a way for people to know that Africa is importabt.

Another thing, i have to buy Garden State it is such a good movie that i can hardly express my appreciation for a movie that expresses something similar to what my sister experienced with depression and the numbness that drugs give to it.  def a good movie!!!
m, 
hmmm the art director hasn't replied yet, i fear that means he doesn't like what i do, but my sis says i'm good as do other people (whom i've mentioned before) so their opinions are the only ones i hold to mean anything of consequence. 

have fun in NYC Deanna!!! you def deserve a Vacation! :)"

"event","Well there are many random things:
i've stopped caring about the gay/bi man who may like me, but he has a boyfriend (such a random dilemma!)
Been watching movies....mainly for the purpose of escaping reality,  :) 
Spanish class has been interesting, i thought i would do a requirement in the summer and just get it over with, went better than i expected!!
Hung out with Dee while her car is in the Ford hospital, poor mustang! :(
Dee's stupid asshole ex has no business dating hot people like my friend, and then picking a lame excuse to dump her over! 
Men suck!
My dating life is DOA too, i've stopped talking to Jack, its too painful he's too bloody far away (a beautiful man) 
I had a date with this guy john, but my issues over my ex (stupid asshole vince who will undoubtedly rot in hell, b/c according to dante those that cheat/betray will be chewed on by satan in the bottom rung) led me to cancel at the last minute when i realized i didn't trust him, even though he has a completely different outlook on life! i may be crazy but oh well.
Hung out with Anne a few times, the sad thing ""hatboy"" doesn't realize we're friends, hahaha idiot. She's got a cool new job!! Yay Anne!
Stopped hanging out with this other friend, cause she reminded me of vince too much too, over controlling, mean, and manipulative.  My sis is proud of me, she said it was the first time i recognized a toxic influence and got rid of it, without anyone telling me too. lol 
My sis gets married in October, changed from August....ugh had to reprint invites!! bah.  But as maid of honor (no ""maid"" jokes ernie)i take my responsibilities very seriously. 
They're actually moving back to Louisville so jeremy can get his Phd in Astro physics (he keeps switching from nuclear back to astro go fig) there and then go to new mexico. Not a bad deal, though my sis is reluctant to think about how they have a large black widow population out there....eeep.
Summer two should be interesting i have my last requirement for art history! woot woot.  people said the 300 art history was tough but it really was damn easy! silly fools.
Ernesto is going through some issues. Poor baby, nobody messes with the mac daddy of Honors English!! especially  when he's super cute like ernie. Sorry i haven't had any crazy sex adventures for you to live vicariously through in Germany, (you ol' married silly monkey). But soon you'll be living it up in the single life. 
To all my guy buds love ya, you're the only decent men i know, too bad none of us are attracted to each other, guess that makes us good friends. lol. But you guys are hilarious. i think chris especially should drop the engineering major and do standup comedy.  You're like that Mitch hedeberg...i know i mispelled that name, but oh well that guy!
Jeff no longer works at the library with me....:( *cries* i'll miss that crackhead. but iming your ass is funny...biff.
Work, parties, class, the occasional test...its a good life.
my future plans, my meetings in NYC :) and finally getting my design label off the ground!!!!!!! it would be about time, copywrights and trademarking was an expensive bitch but worth it. oh well later kiddies, and remember to read some jane austen, cause not only does she rule! but she's fuckin' hilarious!
where else can you get lines like: ""she was imprisoned, starving and partially eaten by her two young sons, but she plans to murder the guards."" now come on really where else can you get that kind of stuff??"

Ahhhh so many things revealed, more drama has apparantly happened in hat boy's life.  My friend Anne, who used to be hatboy's friend (my ex: the psychotic abusive stupid guy...and etc.) was telling me, its kinda funny that he prob thought we weren't friends, lol.  Such a stupid stupid guy, oh well..whatev.  

Been having more fun as of late, got all my work done, so now all i need to do is revise and redo some things. no worries, still yet i worry cause i really like the topic but i kinda lack inspiration to write about it in a way that i want too!!! and it pisses me off.  Cause generally i've been told i'm a good writer!
also learning swahili!! woot woot!
Oh yea Dr. Abaka (history Dep.) is going to help me look over parts of my Rawa drawings and stuff for a more historical look, he says it looks great as it is, but is happy that i'm including him!! yay!
My Fav prof this semester is Dr. Godbeer, he's really really cool, and was nice about my shitty rough draft..(mentioned earlier)and said it was promising.  Also he's now complimented me on my looks twice, (sad that he's gay...cause he's also really pretty...well only sad for me).  But now that i'm talking a bit to jack, maybe i'll get a british man! hee hee 
i would sooooo move to england....like today!!!!  all right i'll rope it in...like my sister tells me i need to do! Finally she approves of a man, but seriously she was right about the others, especially hatboy, so yup maybe this is the best sign ever...uh oh, i'm hopeful! Shit its been since last October since i had a crush on someone!! yay, but then again even when i was w/ hatboy i liked Jack, cause he was sweet and pretty, if i had known before may, i would have ditched hatboy so fast!!!  i would never have dated hatboy had i known Jack liked me in August 2003!!!!!! oh well such is life...hee hee
oh well i'll update more later....."

"event","i think sometimes i seriously over think every fuckin detail.....maybe my best friend can help me out w/ this situation?  ok, i like a guy, but then figure out he is gay, we end up talking about it, and then i feel bad b/c i didn't look him in the eye, when he said it was nothing to be ashamed of, (which i already knew, i couldn't love my gay husband as i do, if i didn't respect and love every aspect of him) maybe i fucked up??
This persons good opinion means a lot to me, and not just b/c i had a crush on him either, but i don't want him to think badly of me, lol, i'm prob over analizing this whole thing...but oh well.

Been taking pics too of people, mainly friends and profs who are apart of a semi graphic design assignment! hee hee, tom keeps calling me his twinky. lol  but if people don't email me back with what they want on their  pics or if they want copies then i can't make them now can i????????!!!
bah! See this is me bitching!
oh well, went out with Alex last Friday night...that was crazy! I drank way too much!!
Partied, danced, drank, danced, drank, and flirted with many many guys!! 


The italian model i dated last summer keeps calling, whatev...and larry the hot guy in sports newscasting still calls.  Hey D you won't believed who called to tell me they're gonna be in town come june!!! Homeland security (jason)!!!!!! hahahahhaha i can't wait he was soooo hot!! that was the best random kiss ever, but then again i did kiss his friend too......i'm a kiss whore!
went out w. a girl...well kinda...and so i went to dinner w/ her, it might have gone further but she's just not my type...too much of a girl
...hates everything about everything.  Plus sadly she doesn't have the one thing i really like either...a dick. But hey, who knows who am i to refuse the possibility of future happiness and companionship with someone, just because they don't fit gender specific criteria that is only installed to expand the species...i could rant my liberal thoughts all day. :)
ahh lets see what else is happening...My friend Vivianne hurt her knee in the Asian night show, she strained a ligament, sooo not cool, a week later its still swollen :(  we've been watching movies and etc this week.
been doing some scmoozing w/ potential ""professional friends"" my dreamworks buddy, says my meeting is on, i just have to go to New York!!! yay, the feedback has been pretty good so far!  Thankfully all my copy rights came through, so if any asshole tries to take my story, he will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, i even had Prof Levi (Miami law school) look over the final paperwork!! woo hoo!
yay
Also, Jack's friend (the one i kissed last May, hee hee the british guy who went back to england two days later, but i had two classes w/ him) well i saw matt, who gave me both their emails, and told me that jack still carries a torch for me, (YAY!!!!!!!!) cause jack is soooo pretty!! So i was like i already knew that, carlie told me in the class last year!! muhahaha and he was like yea, jack still has feelings for you!! i was so happy that after i left him, i did a little dance! lol, and then took pics of the scenery around campus, for no apparant reason. *stupid grin* and Jack is 6 ft 3' (so rare to find a tall man!)
hmmm thinking about hair extensions....
such random thoughts today, i need to buy alcohol, and continue on with my persuit of an essay who's inspiration keeps running away.  I'm so depressed about my hand that i haven't even wanted to draw, not even with my left hand!! i had a cortizone shot, and now i have to have another block done for my hand (shot in the neck) They gave me a psych test too, to see if i am depressed about it, asking me what i call my hand, or refer to it as. lol, but i know this test! from all my sis's psych classes, that i did her homework for, i've seen it, so i beat the test. hahahaha
What can i say, i'm an artist i need inspiration, i think it'll prob hit at 3am the day that its due, i hope not i need to be coherant, and not crazy like i usually seem, i'm already an insomniac, so oh well. 
alright later, i'm at work (LL) should make it look like i'm doing something.....

"event","well i haven't really been that busy, just lacking my laptop since it decided to die, (POS) first the keypad, then the ac adapter, then the hardrive and now the goddamn motherboard is fried! this comp has no idea how many papers i have do this semester!!  

Other than that annoyance i've been chillin, going out to the grove or just randomly talking to people.
I've decided that even though i'm an animator/illustrator that i do what to pursue history, i've had at least 7 classes on the colonial period, here and at UK (seminars)and i do love it, i go through these phases where i am interested in other areas, but i usually come back to the period of 1500-1800 england and colonies.  I think its my second love to art, Ani Difranco says:
""art is why i get up in the morning 
but my definition ends there 
and it doesn't seem fair 
that i'm living for something i can't even define 
there you are right there 
in the meantime""
from the song ""Out of Habit""

So there it is,i can define my art, which is why it is my first love, but i fear my definition only fits the way that i see it, because i'm the one staring at it that way.  I can also remember when i was little how i loved looking at the dresses worn by those in the 1500s-1800s and being fascinated, doing projects on what they would wear.  Then i had to know everything there is to know about it, lol, i think i'm jealous of my fav professor Dr. Foster, and now the new guy Dr. Godbeer, because they've touched these things, and know more than i do.  Makes me nervous around them, because they've already experienced my thought process and it must be very boring to have it repeated.  Especially if by my theory (there are no original thoughts)they know what i will think at certain stages in my life.....oh well no need to obsess.

It seems weird to me that my father is an History teacher and yet we have the exact opposites of interest, he's more of a WW2 kinda guy, lol, i swear he married my mom just to get at all the Pear Harbor/D-Day photos she has from her father and uncle....just kidding! lol but he doesn't care about anything pre-20th century, and that bothers me.  
Another reason i like this period so much is that my family (williams) came over here, i forget how but i'm related to abigail williams, lol, but also the founding of Ky, was helped by my family, i remember my mom telling me a story about how Daniel boone, 6 other families and ours headed this way and settled there at Boonesborough, and tried to survive in the wilderness in those times.  And then she would walk us up the hill, (where the replica stands now) and show us the monument with our families names on it.  Very cool experience!
This summer is going to be wicked, cause my sis, Heather and i will be going on another one of our historical adventures all around Virginia! muhahahahahahahaa (now that she lives in VA this won't be so hard).  Hee hee, we'll be running around Charlotteville first though (we have to wait until her fiance is finished teaching nuclear physics!) so we can go in around, just another opportunity for me to be a third wheel, as my love life is shit......

Yea, my friend Vivianne says not to worry i'll find someone to love, yea sure, i'll find another psychotic bastard like my last one...i think i have a problem though, i never see the guy i should see as a potential love interest.  Its like i'm one of those heroines that i yell at in the novel!! Like Esmerelda in the Hunchback of Notre Dame, what the hell was her issue, he wants to kill her and she still yells out, Phoebus my Phoebus! whatever....

So this summer i am also planning to go to NYC and present my stuff to dreamworks, and hopefully they'll buy one of my ideas..*crosses fingers* My contact says not to worry about it, but how can i not???
But anyways, hopefully it'll work out.

Well it looks like i will be here for next semester too, i'm not really happy about it, but now that i've stopped freaking out (think my heart prob/asthma attack together w/ a panic attack) i am resigned to it.  
i'll be here BECAUSE: when i started the art program my book, said i only had to take 15 creds in 101 classes, now that i am a senior they've changed that saying they changed it awhile back and i can't complain! (what the fuck!!!!???) and now i have to take 104/105 but i've already had upper level sculpting classes, and i've had 4, count them FOUR upper level drawing classes, hence the illustration major!!!!!!!! but now i have to take figure drawing 105????? such bullshit! i've talked to the head of the department (who sadly when i worked with the Res Ipsa Loquitor i reviewed her art not so favorably and she just gave me a look like haha bitch). Then i talked to the dean of students, Dean of art and science and they said it was up to the department head, so basically i'm fucked...so i have to come up with another two classes to take next semester...wankers!!

ok so we're at this party jeff and ernesto and me *big grin* muhahahaha for this kid who's parents have a horse or something in the derby, and this was a pre-preakness party and the kid of this guy rented out a club for the evening and so we went, it was excellant!!!! poor ernie got so drunk though, tequila bottle and vodka and was barely mobile on a plush velvety kinda bean bag thing, (almost blue collar comedy moment) and we had to drag his ass out of there after the party almost carrying the poor guy :(!!!! i mean his now ex, cheated on him *growls* nobody treats the macdaddy of honors english 1 like that!!!! boo on martina!!!

but the better part was that it was a great party muhahahaha and i ended up kissing the son of the guy who owns the horse!!! all i know is his first name, but he was cute, sexy and a good kisser, and since jeff and he both know each other (northwestern alums) we were up in VIP w/ him, so much fun, wore the slinky black dress, still have not developed those pics, boo on me for that. Ernie is showing off pics of me to his german classmates and says i should come and visit him there, b/c they all want me!! i laughed so hard when i heard that, but hey i'll take the compliment who am i to refuse german booty!!
quote of the evening...goes to Ernesto!!!!
i drank how much, i passed out where?""

so lately i'm here at UM woo hoo MIAMI!! and have been hanging out w/ this guy amero, psuedo italian, and talking to larry, and kurt, all three are pretty cute, but amero doesn't want to date b/c he's still upset over his last relationship and he's been dating three other girls besides me, at first i was stunned that a man can juggle that many girls, but then i think of adrienne who has 12, yes 12 boyfriends...you know i love ya, ya ho!! ;) but then again i wanted the whole he likes only me feeling of happiness and now he doesn't want to date, oh well....i'll hang out i can be buddy buddy!! maybe it'll turn into more w/ him who knows, seriously who knows what tomorrow may bring. 
but...........larry seems the best catch he put up this away message for me :) 
""All i want right now is to lay here with you, play with your hair, and watch you fall asleep in my arms.""
awww that is beyond cute hee hee awwww
and then kurt is a sweetheart had lunch w/ him today, hadn't talked to him in awhile, but oh well, also talked to my friend terrel who i haven't talked to in awhile either :)he's awesome!!!
reminds me i talked to my ex matt (o'brian) the other day for over five hours!! woo hooo, his current girl was nonplussed to have heard about that, muhahaha (*** i never said i was anything nice)
but hey i don't want him back. i can be friends, but it sounded like he wanted to be w/ me for some reason, well not just some reason...the whole ""it feels weird not to be w/ you""...."" i miss you"" "" i wish we were still together"" etc that makes me feel like he wants more... is that wrong??
lol, anyways it was a good convo, and it felt like old times w/out romantic feelings for him (at least for me) so it was good :)
yay i've bought a lot of new skirts recently and i need to get my stuff outta storage too, i want my boots!!! hee hee, i need to be the ideal pimpette gotta represent myself, :) adrienne the ho, deanna the seductress, and britt the pimpette hee hee.
ok i'll be back w/ more later!!!"

ummm triplet....how about no, dumbass....you're a moron but in a good way. (lol)

last friday....lets not go there....that was bad, three times bad *shocked*
 ""you ain't never had a friend like me"" tupac 
""twisty pretzel bobcat"" 2 wks notice

also bought books yesterday too, nice to curl up on a wet evening and relax w/ them, quite nice. relax and not let the brain think of new and unusual things, better than walking in the rain and then realizing you're not sure of where you are.....just stormed off in a direction, lol something i've done a lot recently.....geee wonder why?
yay only one more final to go and that's next weds :) my other history class, woo hoo a year from now i will leave here w/ a double bachelors *big fuckin grin* muhahahahaa and my contact in florida might have a promising opportunity for me in new york yay, hee hee the creepy man came through *another grin* 
i am a lucky ass bitch, i must say......who else wants to move to new york w/ me????
i've been extended an invite to england from my classmates (doubt i'll be able to go anytime soon, but sweet to be invited none the less) 
graduation party weds!!!!! all are invited!!! it'll be at fridays and then off to certain debauchery elsewhere, lol wahhhh my senior friends are graduating....and some graduated in dec, but hell we party anyways!!!! muhahahaaa

lets see i'm leaving things out, but some of those are private *winks* so oh well, hee hee, and might i add that if i was a normal individual i would be generally pleased.....wait i am, so i am....wait am i normal? lol, i might be wrong......oh well :)  after my hair was chopped off and donated :) i decided to watch movies!!!! maybe b/c i want to make movies, i have this unholy obsession of seeing everything and analyzing it....thus i watched Hannibal and i was having trouble w/ julianne moore being starling, i'm still having trouble w/ it, cause she's not jody foster....and i prefer to not see the gore, my mind can think of so many that could have happened and seeing gore makes me less frightened.....not as freaky as the first, not total crap but semi-crap implausible mess that it was.  then i watched some of my own movies too, being to angry to sleep, so i haven't yet. 

tonight should afford interesting possibilities....lol and next week too!! yay time for enjoyment....and about that cruise and bbq, when is that by the way this weekend or middle of next week....ahhh sipping a margarita by the sea w/ my hot dog!!! yes my obsession continues as least my walk took me by the dairy queen and i got myself a chilly cheese dog, and ice cream :) then i headed my ass back to campus...on the metrorail, LOL long walks, but thankfully i was led to food.....and then the rain stopped. :)see it only takes a chilly cheese dog to make me happy...that and a little perspective and the ability to be rational....lol obviously not my strong points this year....i used to be so much better at that, my dad said i coulda been british when i was smaller, up til the age of 17 and then he was like nope, def american. lol, oh well more to come later....

And scatter like ice frm the spoon
That was your womb
Comin' down th world turned over

You know the lies that they always told you

You and I got somethin
But it's all and then it's nuthin to me, yeah
And I got my defenses
When it comes through your intentions for me, yeah

And we wake up in the breakdown
With the things we never thought we could be, yeah

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you darlin
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And I want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone

I am no solution
To the sound of this pollution in me, yeah
And I was not the answer
So forget you ever thought it was me, yeah

I'm not the one who broke you

Somehow here is gone

And I dont need the fallout
Of all the past that's in between us
And I'm not holding on
And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here

And I want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone

And I want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling

I know it's out there
I know it's out there
And I can feel you falling

I know it's out there
I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone, yeah

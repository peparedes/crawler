Good flying Harry, if you'd seen it when I did Gryffindor would have won the match, still, we gave that snitch a run for its wings!

You may be starting to wonder what has happened to the swamp of owls which normally mob your bed at around about this time.

Unfortunately some circumstances have occured to prevent this delightful event from occuring.

Throughout the castle you will find those things the owls were bringing you, they are hidden to everyone except you (and the teachers obviously). Have fun finding them.

<p align=""center""><em>In places where things which are lost can be found, 
Amongst the wrappings of another frog, 
Placed in the spot where biscuits were, 
There your first present is found.</em></p>

In other news, the not good news I posted about when I went to that muggle place just after Christmas, an entire family gone, wiped out, no more. There wasn't anything to help with because there wasn't anyone left to help. Yet another casualty in this stupid, stupid war.

I'm going to plant some flowers I think for all of those who died on Boxing Day and place an ever-burning candle in there to commemorate all those who lost their lives over the Christmas period.

If anyone has anything else they would like to place in the memorial garden there is still place. Just let me know where you have planted or mark that spot off on the chart near the garden itself and that way it can be anonymous.

I think that is all for now. Zach, Justin, you guys up for a fly over the garden, I want to have a look at it from up above, you notice more from up there.

Susan, there is a present under your pillow since you couldn't get across for the holidays.

Ernie! I found your King in our dorm for some unknown reason, do you want it back?"

For starters I'm fine, Sam is fine, Emma is fine and Mum and Dad are fine, I just thought you might like to know.

Other villages aren't fine though. One of the places just down the valley a bit was attacked, I haven't been down there, but Mum and Dad went as soon as they heard to see if they could do anything to help, and they came back in tears, so I'm assuming it wasn't good news. Who knows though?

I've had visits from folks over the holidays, was nice to see you all, am just sorry that we couldn't go too far, especially as Mum had me helping with the food preperation. Still was a fun holiday, and it snowed! Has been ages since it snowed properly here, thankfully it wasn't too bad else places would be being flooded come January.

I don't really have much to say and the time on this thingy is ticking down at me - I didn't have a lot of muggle money you see.

Call out to anyone in the area, we have a tonne and a half of food left over, feel free to pop round when you want to, just send a fire message to let us know you are coming okay? Otherwise you are likely to get hexed on appearing!

Happy Belated Christmas everyone, and I'll see you in the New Year if not before."

Other than that I don't have much to say, the N.E.W.Ts are heading rapidly towards us and I've started my revision, it seemed prudent to do so, especially when my time is going to be split between schoolwork and the garden when Spring finally arrives. The seeds have been planted, the garden is growing beneath the snow. I've started collating some of the thngs that people want as memorials, some I'm sure people will place privately and never announce why or who it is for. That is perfectly acceptable. Sometimes dragging up the past is the worst thing that you can do.

It's strange to think that this time last year, well roughly this time last year anyway, it was the Christmas Ball. Soon it will be the holidays and I will return home to spend a decent amount of time with them (not that I was unhappy with the long weekend, but it didn't really make up for missing Summer).

I'm thinking about my future now though, I need to really, I have considered a good many careers, but none of them really make much sense. I could go into herbology and follow Mum's example, or into potions and follow Dad's, or I could break off and go somewhere else, I enjoyed the healing classes we had last year, I could go that route, it would take into account both of the above skills. I don't know. I think I will find Professor Sprout and discuss it with her, it may put my mind at rest.

There is a book going round. It's a strange book. It first started at the party, or at least that is when I noticed it. I wonder what it is for.

Zach, Justin - is everything okay with you guys? You seem a little edgy.

Ernie - How'd it go?

Ellie - My dad just sent me a new book, you might find it interesting, it is on my bed.

Susan - Chocolate, biscuits and that charms homework by the fire tonight?

A Gryffindor is brave, A Ravenclaw is wise, A Hufflepuff is loyal and a Slytherin is Ambitious.

Yet aren't we all something from each of the houses at time?

Don't you ever want to achieve something? Don't you ever want to face your fears? Don't you ever stand with your friends just because they are your friends? Hasn't there ever been a moment when you give advice?

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe we can only be what our houses say we are. Maybe this is our chance to see how we deal when someone tells us to be something else.

"event","I remember as a child writing stories about what I did on my holidays. I always found it fun to read later in the year when school had set in and summer seemed ages away.

So, I'm going to do a 'What I did on my Holidays' style entry - just to cheer me up if we don't have another break.

I went home, it was funny having Sam on the train for the first time on the way home, as opposed to how I always imagined it. Still, the journey went well and Mum picked us both up at the station.

When we got home Emma was sat in the window seat waiting and my Dad had cooked tea for us all.

Which reminds me, messages from Emma to you all:

<i>Ellie</i> - Emma demands that next time we have a holiday you are to come visit.
<i>Justin</i> - Emma states that next time we have a holiday you must come visit.
<i>Zach</i> - Emma insists that the next holiday we have you must go see her
<i>Ernie</i> - Emma wants to know why you didn't visit this time and informs you that if you don't visit next time she is going to hunt you down.
<i>Susan</i> - Emma says that she wants to see you and is upset that you didn't come visit as she wanted to show you something.

Okay. So that is my little sister placated.

I spent Thursday in my Dad's Potion's Lab reading and mixing up some potions for him, he was running low on Pepper-Up Potion so I had the fun of making that all day. I also did some research for our potions assignment.

<i>Professor Snape</i> - is there any way that you could possibly suggest to avoid dying the tips of your fingers orange whilst making that potion? Or am I just mishandling one of the ingredients? I know I tested the potion and it was correct.

Friday I worked in Mum's shop in the morning and then I took Emma to the stream in the afternoon, Sam had disappeared off to one of his friends, he was muttering something about practising to get on the Quidditch team for next year. We had fun.

Saturday I took my Apparation test (I passed incidentally) and wandered through Diagon Alley. After that I apparated home and worked in Dad's shop until it was time to make tea for everyone.

Sunday Mum drove Sam and I to get the train back here. Train journey was fun though, everyone seemed to be in much better spirits, although more subdued than they were on the way home. After that we had the feast.

So that was my holiday. I enjoyed it. Just wish that it had been a little longer."

I don't know what to do about the whole Head 'Boy' thing. Half of me thinks that maybe I should join in the campaigning either by supporting Ernie or by standing for it myself. The other half is just sat here hoping that Warrington and everyone else wakes up before this farce gets much worse. Who knows. I am able to stand for it, it's the same loophole that allows Pansy to stand. I don't know.

Everyone in Hufflepuff seems to be planning something and not letting me know what is going on. I'd like to know what it is that they are planning, in that I might be able to help or something. Who knows. I just feel a little left out. Like they are purposely excluding me.

Ellie bought me a pair of quidditch gloves and stitched a flower onto them so they match hers. I guess it's so when we have our fun games I don't resort to playing mittens. Not to mention the gloves are so much warmer and durable than normal mittens. They were a random present though. Still the thought was there.

Plans for the garden are progressing well, Neville's plans are wonderful. 10 days till the planting deadline though and that is a little worrying as we still have to go through feedback with the other people who wish to be involved, saying that though we are incorporating any suggestions that we receive so I can't envision any problems.

I think that is all for now.

Going to go hide on my bed to avoid hearing about anymore of the 'nothing'."

Blood does matter.

It does.

However it only matters in such a way as to link siblings and family together, all Pureblood means is family. Mainly because all Purebloods are family. The suspiscion about the Muggleborns is that they are not family, in any sense of the word. They cannot trace their line back to a wizard. They are an outside invader in our world. But saying that, they have every right to be here. The Half-borns, again, not so much a problem with them. They are family, just in a manner that isn't particularly befitting.

Either way, family, friends or mere aquaintences, beliefs or non beliefs. I'll treat them all the same. After all, I'm not a Gryffindor."

I've just got the last of my night-time visitors settled. Or rather, the last one who came to me crying is now asleep. When is this all going to end?

It can't be cabin fever. It can't be. It can't all be related to Dean and Padma either. I mean, the nightmares were there first. Not unless everyone in this school is turning into seers.

This is getting rediculous.

I'm tempted to ask for a large bottle of dreamless sleep to dish out to those who come to me, just so <b>I</b> can get some sleep.

I'm not sure what is worse, that I'm not having these nightmares or that I'm not getting any sleep because of other people having the nightmares.

I may just get on with the work that has been set.

Dean.... I don't know what to say. I can't believe it. Not within Hogwarts. Hogwarts is supposed to be safe, but if they can get to us here is anywhere really safe?

We're all going to die young. It's expected. This is war. War on anyone who does not align themselves the correct way.

But which is the correct way?

I'm a pureblood. I have friends who are muggle-born. I have friends who are half-and-half. Does it really matter who you are? Or should I just play lip service to all the causes and continue on as I am doing?

I don't know if I can.

I don't know if it is right to do so or not.

Do unto others as they do unto you - unless it is violence when the best plan is to erect a shield and run the hell away, getting your friends out first.

Something happened in Gryffindor - what doesn't happen in Gryffindor?

Sirius Black is on these journals! - first it was LeStrange and now Black? Is any of this safe at all????

There was an explosion. In Gryffindor. Targetted at Harry. However, apparently Harry is fine, so it failed.

Sometimes I think this school would be so much safer if Harry Potter didn't come here.

Then on top of the failed protection of and attacks upon little Mr ""I'm the target for all the Deatheaters"", you have these blasted nightmares, the wierd ghost-not-ghost events and well, classes start tomorrow, I still have a queue of crying first years, a gaggle of second years who I said I'd have a word with and there are a group of third years in the corner. The fourth years seem to be dealing by having mass parties.

I just sometimes wish that we didn't have to be involved with the side-effects of the great and fabulous Mr Potter.

Just one quiet year at school. Please. One year where it is quiet and peaceful and we can get our work done and there are no major events. For Merlin's sake it's our NEWTs this year!

It's not going to happen though is it? Not with things as they are.

I just hope that after my year has left the school will be quiet again for Sam and Emma when she comes here (when Sam is in his 4th year). Just so they don't have to deal with all of this all the time.

I tried everything I could think of. Everything. It didn't work. Obviously because it was too late and nothing can ressurect the dead.

There are graves my mother still visits every year, she won't say why they died, she won't say who killed them either, I don't suppose she actually knows, in fact I don't suppose she ever will know.

We're looking after the magical creatures now. Until they find someone to take over Hagrid's position. Seems almost unreal, we'll never see Hagrid walking across the grounds of Hogwarts, never see him laughing his way through the castle.

If only I'd got their sooner, if only the flower-hogs had decided to not get defensive when I tried to take them out of Hufflepuff. Maybe I would have been there in time. Maybe I could have done something, maybe then he wouldn't be dead.

Madam Pomphrey and Madam Sprout said they are available if Susan or I need to talk. I don't think I will talk though. It just doesn't seem right.

Just if, if I'm going to die, I think I want to die like that, surrounded by the things I hold dear, going quietly like a luke-warm cup of tea down your throat.

Professor Sinistra was a little short with us, ordering us around, but I suppose we both needed it, I felt half-like a robot, if I'm like this in crisis situations then what good am I ever going to be?

I've kept a button-fly, I'm going to call it Flutter, it landed on Hagrid's nose in the cabin whilst I was trying to get a teacher. It made me smile at the time. It's just something to remember him by. He may have not been the best Professor in the world, but he knew his stuff and he loved the creatures he cared for.

Sleep Well Hagrid. Hogwarts will miss you."

"event","I must apologise to the Hufflepuffs.

The button-flies and the flower-hogs have got completely out of control.

After I've finished my dinner tonight I'll take them down to Hagrid (since I don't have the heart to turn the poor creatures back into brushes and buttons) and will restrict myself to only transfiguring things in company or in class. Susan, Ellie - if you want a wander feel free to meet me in the dorm, I'm going to need some help moving all these creatures.

Once again, I apologise.

Oh, Ellie, Zach, Justin, Susan and Ernie, all of you, out on the quidditch pitch tomorrow morning as I have to show you something. You'll need your brooms! Hannah has learnt to fly! (well kind of, I'm a little wobbly).

Not to mention, I've borrowed some lemonade and strawberries and cream from the kitchens for later, my mother mentioned it was the time for them, something about a competition or something. So I thought I'd get some in, just because they are nice.

Professor Sprout, I know we're restricted to the grounds, but in advance, would it be at all possible for me to floo home at the beginning of August, just so I can go with my brother to get his new things for the new term? I mean, this is the only time I'll have another sibling coming to Hogwarts, I'll have left by the time my sister comes here.

Hagrid? It is alright if I bring them down, isn't it? I mean they are so adorable and wonderful, but I just don't think the Hufflepuff Common room is the best place for them really. Not to mention I'm sure their development is going to be fascinating, the life-cycle of a flower-hog, does it's flowers wilt when it comes to winter? Do they die in cold snaps? If you feed them plant grow do their flowers grow better? Do they contract greenfly? All answers I'm sure you are dying to find out I'm sure. So I'll be down after dinner if that is alright."

Panic over.

It wasn't anything to do with Potions.

It was something extracurricular.

I haven't missed anything.

Least I don't think I have.

Will check my notes with Ellie's. That will reassure me entirely.

Although, Zach brewing potions extracurricularly. That's a new thing. But a good new thing. Everyone should know how to make potions for all circumstances.

Having tea with Zach later, that will be good. I've missed the Hufflepuffs and tea can't hurt people can it?

Now I should get ready for Healing.

I can't believe I'm missing a class. Will have to get the notes off someone.

Revision has well, been revision.

<b>Potions</b>
I've taken a page out of Ellie's book and have been brewing potions in the dorm when nobody else is there. I think I have the hang of most of the ones that may come up in the exams, and the results appear to be promising. I just hope that when it comes to the exams I don't lose my head again.

<b>Charms</b>
I think I can manage most of the charms we've been doing, I may get Charlie or Bill to help me with a couple of the more complex ones since I think there is something I'm doing wrong, possibly the wand action, maybe the pronunciation, I'm not sure.

<b>DADA</b>
I have notes, they make sense. I just am not sure I have the complete information needed. I wish I knew what was going to be tested, then I could be prepared.

<b>Herbology</b>
I've been helping down in the greenhouses, and although what I've been doing isn't directly related to the course content, it should all help. I hope.

<b>Transfiguration</b>
I've noticed that the more flustered I get the more flamingoes show up. However, I think I have the hang of it now. After a couple of tries I can get usually complete the transformation. Need to work on it so I can do it straight off rather than on the second go.

<b>Alchemy</b>
It's notes and history. All be it some of it is fascinating, some of it is really dull. It's like the development of what we now know as potions, just mostly theory, or at least that is about all I've picked up from it. I think I'm missing some information from the class though. Although I know my notes are complete.

<b>Advanced Healing</b>
I can heal things now. I just wish we'd be allowed to help the healers with their search for a cure, it'd be wonderful experience for anyone wanting to go into healing as a career. Just I don't think they want students underfoot.

<b>Other things</b>
I don't think the Hufflepuffs want me around.

Justin is being a little off, he's sleeping a lot. Then again, I keep getting the feeling that he thinks that just because I have magic I'm better than him. I wish he still had his magic, I really really do. I just can't do anything about it and nobody will let me help. So I'll just stay away.

Ellie admitted that she liked Ernie. I feel bad that I was with Ernie for so long and didn't want to be, whilst she wanted Ernie and couldn't be with him. I don't know. I just feel awkward around them now.

Ernie, Ernie <s>is</s> was my best male friend, now, I don't know, things are still iffy between us. I just don't know what to say to him anymore, not without starting with an apology.

Zach, there is something up with Zach, I just don't know what though. I may try find him and talk to him, but I don't know if it would do any good.

Susan and Ellie are up to something, I just don't know what. I'll just keep the dorm tidy and then whatever is planned will be fine.

I don't know, I try to make everyone happy and I just end up isolating myself. I probably should have just used cheering charms and it would have been so much easier. Then again, that could have ended in an impromptu duel and after the Gryffindor vs Slytherin duel and the consequences thereof I doubt that would have been a good thing.

I'll probably just go find a quiet room somewhere and get some studying done, that way I'm not going to upset anyone else."

I suppose I haven't written here for a very long time, didn't particularly seem to be much to say.

I guess the only good thing that came out of the howler is that now we know it's a disease transmitted through contact and through the air.

I suppose any offers I make to Madam Pomfrey to help with any creation of an antidote would be turned down.

I feel a little useless, I mean, I still have my magic, and well, me having it doesn't help my friends, and probably makes it worse. I don't know.

I wish there was a way I could make things better. I wish there was <i>something</i> I could do.

I also wish that Ernie wasn't still avoiding me.

I just don't know what to do.

I'm going down to the greenhouses maybe there is something useful I can do there."

We managed to get out just before the rain came down yesterday, just a little hovering, I think I'm getting the hang of it, I even managed to move a little. Justin wasn't all that talkative really, or rather as long as I steered clear of current events he was fine. I guess that is to be expected, I'd be devastated if Mummy and Daddy suddenly upped and disappeared.

I don't want to give him false assurances that they are alive, I don't know if they are or not, and if they aren't, well I don't really want to think about that, but at least then I haven't lied. I just hope that they are alive and safe somewhere.

I finally got an answer back from Ellie about what Ernie really thinks of me she said he likes me and thinks I am nice. I don't know Ernie is well, Ernie, he's like very very best male friend, but I couldn't do anything with him, we're just too close for that.

I don't know!

Rain was far too heavy after lunch so Zach, Justin and I didn't get to go for a fly, even with heating charms and the umbrella charm.

Note to self: look up the proper name for the charm which acts like an umbrella, I <b>knew</b> stopping studying as much was a bad thing.

Then the conversation about Kermit. I didn't have anything to chip in. Perhaps I should send home and get my mum to send in some of my puppets, but I'm frightened the strings would get caught in the owls claws and they are horrible to untangle.

I think I need some daisies in here, big dog daisies, They'd brighten the place up.

<li> a small black one with an embroidered daisy on the front - this is my herbology revision one </li>
<li> a small navy blue one with a hedgehog sat next to a bush - this is my transfig revision one </li>
<li> a small dark purple leather-bound one with a smoking cauldron on the front - this is my potions revision one </li>
<li> a small yellow one with a wand and a hat on it - this is my charms revision one </li>
<li> a small light blue one with a white cross on the front - this is my medicinally orientated revision one </li>
<li> a small plain light green one - this is my alchemy revision one </li>
<li> a small maroon book with a variety of creatures around the edges of the cover - this is my DADA revision book </li>
<li> a medium sized book with flowers on the cover that varies in colour - this is the scheduler that Ellie bought me </li>
<li> a very small lilac one with Prefect Duties engraved on the front - this one pretty much explains itself </li>

All of them are incredibly important and all of them have my name on the front cover and on the first page of the book. So if someone finds them could I please have them back, they were on my bookshelf, I think, but now there is a gap, or they might be in the library, or somewhere else.

I tried to fix the mess that the house is in. It failed. I give up.

I'm now going to go lurk in the prefects bathroom till its all over and everyone has gone to bed. Wonder if I can work out how to skim stones.

Why can't they just all get along? 

Ellie is in a huff with me. Zach and Ernie are still not talking, something has happened between Ellie and Justin but I don't know what. Ellie is irritated at Zach because of Pansy and it all sucks!

So I'm going to hide till they all sort themselves out. I'm sure they will manage it. Maybe."

I think maybe possibly that I may possibly maybe have a possible maybe partner of the ball. Maybe. It could just be that maybe because we are both prefects and possibly because we both possibly maybe need to possibly maybe need to go that we possibly maybe ended up as defaults. That is possibly maybe the only possible reason I can think of. I'm sure its nothing else, it couldn't be, could it? People are needing <s>dates</s> partners for the ball, and with Ellie not going obviously I was the only other choice, so that must be the reason. 

going through facts

There is a ball.
All prefects must attend
We are both prefects
We both must attend
Thus we, if there are no other options need to go together

There. 

There is nothing in this. It is purely a professional partnership. maybe.

Or is it? I don't know. If only Ellie was going, then this might not have happened. He's a friend, friends partner each other. Right? Friends do each other a favour. So this is only a maybe date. It is not a date. I don't think. Maybe.

I should have asked for more details. But we were needing to get to the field. Couldn't miss the quidditch match right?

He wouldn't seriously ask me would he? Not if he had other options. I don't know.

Least we are going together. We'd have shown up together anyway right? Hufflepuff's stick together. Even when they are grouchy at each other, friendship means more than small arguments."

I can't even get my wand movement right for Charms anymore, tried to levitate something earlier and it just fell over. I don't think its supposed to do that.

As for Herbology, I love it to pieces, but so much stuff to memorise I don't think my mind can contain that much stuff. I'd try something to help me but with the mess I'm in with charms I don't think even that would work.

Potions is well, potions, its the only one that seems to be going at all well. That is simply a matter of knowing what goes in first and what doesn't. At least I hope its going okay. I hope.

As for Transfiguration, well, yeah, its okay, now and then.

I'm so going to fail. I don't want to, but I am. Should have just gone into something else. I don't know.

Maybe studying with Justin and Ernie is going to help. I hope."

Going back to hiding now - I'm in the library.

Edit:

Ellie - Can I have some of the cards from all the chocolate frogs that are accumulating in the dorm?

Ernie - I could do with a hand with the Herbology Homework, or the charms homework or something.

Justin - In between my hiding time, fancy studying in the library?

Zach - That DADA homework. Do you happen to have a copy of what we have to do? I'm sure I wrote it down somewhere.

So now, to commence my hiding. 

If you need me I'll be in my dorm doing my homework, or in the commons doing my homework, or in the library researching for my homework."

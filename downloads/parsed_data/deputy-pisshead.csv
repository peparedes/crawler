"event","Well went to the Cumberland last night as it was the Jacobites evening meeting.

Went to get the usual pint of IPA from the bar brought it back and both myself and KK tasted the beer and it was minging. It was ice cold, lager temp, and tasted 'tangy'. So i took the beer back to the bar and said this ain't IPA. God i wish i had not done that. Basically I got told that it is meant to be that cold, and it was the brewery that had changed it to be the 'correct' way. I then told them that I have just drank the same beer at another pub in Edinburgh, and it tasted completely different, here....

They then finished with the comment, if you don't like real ale, you shouldn't be drinking it! I seem to think they lost the point of my complaint, and never even tasted the pint to see if i was right or not. They then provided 2 more pints, and these were significantly warmer...

Good way to loose custom The Cumberland!"

Thinking about doing the floor as well.

Better come up with something else to do this weekend, as I won't be seeing Emma :P and spending the weekend in the pub while appealing as it is is a bit of a waste. I guess I'll be in the pub all weekend then :P"

Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

"event","Well i nearly killed my climbing partner at ratho today.

He was about half way up (8 metres) and about a metre above the last clip (7 metres) i was paying out slack so he could clip then he peeled and fell. He passed the clip and fell the amount of rope above plus what i had given out (5 - 6 metres, to be expected) and then he kept going and i finally locked it off about 2.5 metre from the ground. However the rope stretch allowed him to boot me in the head.

Check out the rope burn to my hand an hour after:

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/deputy_pisshead/pic/000012cf"" align=""Center"">

I suppose the only good thing to come of this is that he wasn't injured other than a couple of grazes, and he didn't deck.

Was i not paying enough attention? Was i subconsciously paying out slack to lessen the fall?

Whatever the outcome i need a damn good kicking! It's as bad as having a ND at the range. This is my first major fuck up in climbing in 8 years and i nearly killed someone."

Realised that this was a bad idea and slinked off to the toilet to make myself spew. However I wasn't quite fast enough and some got into my system :( Got home and spewed, not voluntarily this time. Woke up at 1300 wanted to spew again, still pissed and straight back to bed. Back up at 1630 and feeling ok now!"

As far as I can see I have three options at the moment:
<ol>
<li> stick it out in the hope that it will improve - <i>unlikely judging by the way moral is at the moment force wide</i> </li>
<li> Apply for the new vacancy at the airport - <i>this would be OK as it has to be more pallet able than being a CBO in the city</i></li>
<li> Move to a different force preferably northern - <i> however this would mean leaving quite a few friends behind, but I do have friends in northern as well</i></li>
</ol>

And i did not come last!
However got eaten by midges and slightly sun burnt, but good time had by all.
Back to work on monday, mmmm is that such a good idea?

"event","So far so good.Spring break has been pretty cool, except the part where i had to see Ben in the act, other than that, its been all good.I had to work the first couple of days of spring break, got to hang out with Jonny V., Zach, and Adam which was fun.The other days i didnt really do anything before work.Yesterday was cool, Ben stayed over, and we sat around for awile.I had to go up to the bank and take out some cash, then danielle and nikki came by it was really cool.Later we went up to the mall and i ate to many fries from that chiken place.The week is over and it really pisses me off, school is shitty.Why should i have to wake up to goto a place that pisses me off?I guess its just the way things work.I just figured id update so everyone knew what was going on.lata"

"event","Ladies and gentleman,boys and girls, children of all ages.I am here tonight to present a live journal entry.Hey all...its me again, the only person who posts in this thing, considering its mine!Tonight wasn't to bad, went with my pops for a little while
then it was off to have some BBCL fun.We went up to jp's and chilled for a little bit,oh what fun that was.Then we took off to some shitty talent show where there were a lot of half naked Delran girls performing.You would think it was exciting considering they were half naked, but they were Delran girls and it definately wasn't exciting.We hung out there for a little bit and met up with Adam and Frank.Then took off for the final ours of our shit filled night.We ended up at the Dynasty, where tons of odd/humorous things occured.I mean from Adam making his titties bounce to watching this kid eat fries with cheese,gravy, and ketchup.Possibly the grossing thing i have seen in a long time.We had some laughs,tears were shed, but at the end of the night,when all the dirt had cleared, it turned out to be a pretty fun diner trip.Thats about all i have to say about my day.Wow kids, wasnt that exciting?IM OUT MUTHA FUCKA'S.

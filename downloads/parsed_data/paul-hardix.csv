"event","Hey! Wow! Holy hand grenade! My first LJ post since May! I wonder just who many of my friends still read and post here. Gimme a comment just saying whether you do or not, I'm considering doing the LJ think again a little. I've been on MySpace mostly. There are some definite bonuses you get there that you don't get here. Like music, personal messages, and it's a helluva lot easier to customize. The bulletin's just a pain in the ass, because everyone uses it for dumb forwards and such.

Anyway! Yeah! Let's here a ""hoorah"" for no reason at all! Shazam!"

"event","Am I cheap? I mean it. I don't buy jack shit hardly. I can't discuss the details of Regina's present, presently, but at the present, it seems I am a horribly cheap person overall. Here's two factors: when offered food, I take as much as I can possibly eat. I never buy anything but the occasional snack and gas. We went to Bahama Breeze last weekend, and spent a shitload of money. But it was on food and drinks. Saw <i>DaVicni Code</i>, and last night rented some movies, but these were almost entirely Regina's ideas. I picked out a movie, yeah, but if she hadn't said anything I'd have probably been comfortable all the same. It's not that I'm not enthusiastic about these things, I direly wanted to see <i>DaVicni Code</i>, but probably wouldn't have unless she wanted to.

So, I tried to remember the last thing I bought myself. I can't. Not like, a pop or some shrimp at a restaraunt, but an object. Maybe I'm not materialistic. But I doubt it. I love buying things. I just, never want to. I noticed today that almost all of my black socks are torn apart from wear and tear. It hasn't occurred to me to buy some new ones. I just cringe and switch to white socks.

I don't remember the last thing I, myself, bought for someone else. Regina has been the ""gift-getter,"" while I am generally quite clueless as to what's going on with our money. I don't carry a check-book, and just want to save and pay on the bills as much we can. I think I really am cheap. Huh. I'm a penny pincher. It's probably because I've never had money, and I took on Regina's debt (I'm not complaining about that, that's what happens when you get married, she took on my med bills as well). People buy random crap all the time who are in debt, but they really only make it worse for themselves.

Anyway, the whole point of this is, I think it's time to buy some new socks. :P"

"event","Soemtime I wonder what I'm thinking wh75en I come up with subject headings. Probably some moneky throwing darts at a bunch of weird ideas taped to a dartboard inside my head.
Anyway, I was browsing eBay, and discovered, that while 2 years ago I could have bought the original Silent Hill game for around $10, every single one had a bid no lower than $30.00. I saw one that was up to $51.00. I know that the bids are starting high too. Damn the movie! Oh well. Heh.

Work is getting on my nerves. Really bad. The copany does this bullshit thing, every three months, where we had to count every-- rfnjhboerd7igrDK GJERH890YHTJN7K68J ASTRJ[P'OKZDG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sorry, I just got incredibly pissed off at my browser for not word-wrapping. I fucking hate having to scroll over to see what the hell I just wrote. Anyway, I'll continue.... We have to count every task that we complete within every process/function. What does this mean? (holy shit, I may have fixed the wrapping problem) It means (fuck, no I didn't) that I have to stop and count then record everything I do. Yesterday, it turned out that I did well over 10,000 tasks. Perhaps 20,000. And these are scattered throughout different filetypes, and I have to specify how many tasks were in each file type, and how long it took to complete each process. I open a batch, I record the start time and batch number. Every few seconds, I tally the pages, at the end, multiply and add up stuff, and record finish time. End of the day, add all the shit up until my head starts to throb. I had a dream about doing this stuff last night. Pissed my off. I hate work dreams.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to find Mozilla Firefox's ass. It must be kicked. I fixed the dan thing yesterday, but since Glenn got on here and ""fixed"" windows, none of our setting have been saving properly, and our anti-virus won't scan unless I fuck with it for an hour.

"event","But how can it ever be time to change, when all around you is both chaotic and yet so constricting-ly oppressive?
I find it difficult to go after any of my dreams due to the world I'm forced to live in. Life is good. But I don't feel I'll ever get to live my dreams. I suppose I'll just work a boring job, smile and try to enact at least a little of the meager freedom that we're allowed in our down time.

Anyway, aside from that, Saturday was fun. After I woke up, I watched a little TV, got ready, and went out to get an oil change that never ended up happening. I supposed to go in to get it done at 11:30, so... yeah. I'll get a second key done as well so I can feel free to lock myself out of my car and not panic. Er, so after that, Regina got home and I made some super-good meatless burgers with Gimme Lean!(tm). It's good stuff. I sauteed some sliced portabellas and onions to a golden brown and sprinkled on some shredded cheddar. Could've used some seasoning on the patties though. Regina didn't like the patty.

Then we had a double date with Jessica and Matt. Good times. We played Uno, wherein I was stomped for not knowing the proper rules. I think I came in second-to-last only because I won a single round while Jessica had a big handfull of cards. About 190-something points worth. There was some drinking involved. Found out I hate Budweiser. Then we all went to the Esquire and saw <i>Thank You For Smoking</i>. Go see that if you haven't. It's damn funny. I think half the people lit up after they got outside. The movie's focus wasn't a ""You'll die if you smoke!"" thing. More like a ""Why the hell am I in this job? Oh Yeah! That's why"" thing. Then we went to Sitwells and chatted it up some more. Regina and I got some sandwich groove on and I had some concoction of cappuccino and Bailey's. Not a fan of it unless I add a pack of raw sugar.

Now we're home, Regina's asleep, and I'm typing like a gimp due to 1) Sebastian thinking I was playing with him under the cover with my finger, and 2) because I closed the fridge door on my other wrist while making a portabella-mozzarella sammich. And I can't sleep.

I need some nuggets of wisdom to get me motivated. I want to return to the days of hanging with local bands and actually do things. I want to get in some time working on some music. All the people I know who have those sorts of resources or connections are too busy to take on any ideas or projects, or just aren't interested, or dropped off the face of the Earth (V-Mob, where the frag are you?).

Hummmm.... that's probably all I can throw out for now. I'm not depressed about the lack of dream-reaching, just disappointed in the poor positioning my life has attained for such purposes.

"event","Things could be much worse. But sometimes it's hard to see that.
I can't sleep right now because I'm so angry about what's going on with one of Regina's credit cards. She somehow tried to pay it online with her old 5th/3rd or 1st Financial account, I don't recall, which  are both closed in any case. So we got charged an equal amount of what she tried to pay, plus an overdraft fee, a late fee, and two finance charges. I seriously fucking hate credit card companies. People on the phone know they can fuck you around and around until your ass is so sore you can't sit down, so they just play little games of ""no"" and pass the phone to the person next to them and pretend they're a supervisor.

It might not be so hard to get by once I start getting paid from my new job, but just thinking about going in there the 1st week scares the hell out of me. It's such a huge building, and the department I'm going to work in is dark a dreary, and smells like an old basement. There are creepy, middle to upper-middle class, ultra-christians there, and I hate those kinds of people. They always think the world outside their lives has no faults, and that people aren't really struggling to get by. The blind themselves to the harshness of what really happens and just... damn I'm so bitter these days.

Anyway, I have a game to run as well. That's not important in life, except that it serves a purpose in the way of creativity, and escapism for the players. Running an rpg is no easy task, especially when so much in your life pisses you off. Sometimes being pissed helps though, only it may end up ruining the fun for the players. It's funner to play and get out frustrations by living out that fantasy vicariously through the character in your imagination, in the world the GM creates. Good stuff.

Anyway, I should probably do something to take my mind off of the asshole with poorly spoken english who reminds me of why sometimes a person just needs to be punch in the voicebox to understand you better.

While a vision of turning his weapon on him and mounting his head on a wall ocurred to me, all I had the power to do was to press ""print,"" package them up, file them, and get on with my work. That didn't stop me from slamming my fist on the inner door to the freezer, where no one would hear, and cursing him as disgracefull a death as one he gave to a defenseless animal. I wonder if he'll stuff the birds that will never know the sky again and gaze at them sometime, thinking himself superior to anything that lacks the power to kill so indifferently.

Regina was upset that I hadn't gotten to finish cleaning the bedroom or the catbox. Left the heat on too. I feel bad for these things, but I guess it's not neccessary to dwell on them too much. I'll just try harder to keep an eye on the time.

Had a nightmare about some big freak of a thing. Looked like a human crossed with a bear and a ram. It tried to kill me, then the random stuff of dreams happened and it didn't make sense anymore. I was suddenly stuck trying to wake up against what I think were subconscious symbols of how Regina and I haven't gotten to spend much time together. Then as Regina and I left a diner (and I asked ""Did I just east spaghetti?"" ""Yes, you did."" ""Wish I'd ordered something else..."") a homeless woman holding a passport from the store asked us for some money to send her photo in to get her visa. We gave her a few dollars, asked if she'd eaten, and Regina ran into the diner to get her a burrito. I think it was Regina. It may have been me, watching from Regina's point of view. Whoever it was, they ran like me. Then the lady got on a bus, and Sebastian woke me up by tearing something up near the computer. Damn dreams. Never really make sense.

"event","Let me explain: I had to drive Virgil to Mindin (I think it's speled right) to pick up his soon-to-be-baby-mamma. Mindin is a little town, so small it doesn't have it's own <i>a)</i> grocery, <i>b)</i> gas station, <i>c)</i> police department, <i>d)</i> fire department (it does have a volunteer fire squad, though they just hold the fire back until the Celina Fire Dept. shows up).

Anyway, so I leave at 2pm, this trip is supposed to take a total of 4 hours round trip. I go to pick Virgil up from Bryan's, and Bryan is laying on the floor playing a baseball game on his XBox (Microsoft can sit on it), and Virgil is sitting on the couch watching. It takes around an half an hour to get out of there, and then we go to the government building to get his mother's bank card, which is in the hands of his very unreliable and highly neurotic sister. So, she's turns out not to be there. Great. We go to the jail (oh yeah, her other-baby-daddy is in jail for child support for his other baby-mamma). So, we go and I get some gas out of our account.

We go to Virgil's trailer, and he has to let a dog out, argue, etc. After getting firmly creeped out by his 8-year old niece, I go outside, then about 4:15, we leave. We get stuck in traffic in Dayton forever. All this time, Heather keeps calling Virgil, and I keep getting nervous. He was driving my car, and I was to drive back. That way we didn't get too tired. Oh, Bryan kept calling too, and we'd ask him ""Did ya lose yet?"" Inside joke, never you mind. Anyway, we get some food, Virgil pays for it. We get to Mindin between 6 and 7. The air is nice there. We get the kids in the car, and we go.

The boys haven't eaten and neither has Heather. We stop at McD's, and get some food for them. We drive forever longer and the kids were mainly quiet. Sometimes, though, I couldn't hear myself cringe.

Well, about 9:30 we get them home. I stand around like a fool because I'm uncomfortable with all the animosity coming from his family toward Heather (they had a fight not too long ago, and the Withrows love nothing more than a good grudge). I leave, and notice I'm out of gas. I pull into a place and get gas. I get home, and I'm so damn tired, hadn't seen Regina all day, and I just collapse on her on the couch. Then I went out for pop and a shake at UDF.

God I love UDF milkshakes."

Microsoft is the most unreliable and unscrupulous (albeit biggest) software company in existence. Every time I've used explorer's browser, it causes issues. We get viruses, spyware, adware and people just poking their nose in our hard drive. It pisses me off. I like Firefox. But now, it's having problems. Somehow, our browser profile keeps getting hijacked, and I have no choice but to delete it, losing all of our settings in the process, in order to do ANYTHING in the internet. I blame Microsoft for it. They can't stand the thought of someone using something other than their products, because that means they can't breathe down our necks and see what we're doing, stick things on our computers that mess everything up and make us do what THEY want us to do. Heh, did anyone with an Apple computer try using Microsoft products? It's not pretty. Things made specifically for Apple by Microsoft are basically sabotge. Why companies and consumers put up with this who can afford to get something else is beyond me.

I'm starting working at Ohio Casualty Monday, and my last day with 1st Choice was supposed to be Saturday night/Sunday morning. It turns out that though I was told by numerous people the required notice was 5 days, it's 2 weeks. Not only that, but my remaining wages are cut down to 5.13 an hour. I'm no legal genius, but I've heard that's illegal. I'm planning on seeing about filing a class action lawsuit, since I can't afford it alone and most of the employees I've worked with have been treated poorly by the company. If it even gets to court, ignoring the possibility of failure, it will cost them more than it would to pay my full wages, and it will hurt their business dramatically. Not many people will want to hire guards who are disgruntled. It just doesn't make one feel secure.

Anyhow, if indeed they are cutting my wages, I'm turning in my uniform today (after I've had a good long nap), seeing if I can start OCG tomorrow and telling 1st Choice I'll see them in court with nearly every previous employee (that's still living) and many current. Hopefully, they won't like the idea of more scandals than they already have. If they don't mind, then my business classes for Primerica will suffer, and I'll be really pissed. Primerica has an attorny on retainer, and maybe, juuuuust maaaaybe, they'll represent us poor, working class whelps.

I don't think too many people know how to balance their lives so that they're nice and understanding, yet don't get taken advantage of. Being nice at all opens you up to be taken advantage of. So, Stacy, shut the hell up. I could see Mad TV making fun of the Tyra Banks show (Regina was watching it, and the episode caught my interest... screw you), and having Stacy say a bunch of meaningless evangelical nonsense.

Anyhow, my car is in at Goodyear (bastards), I had to have the front left tire and wheel replaced because on 275 east, my car kept hitting this ridge in the road that screwed it up and blew my tire. The other front wheel was dented in too, and all of the tires needed changing anyhow. Also, oil needed changing. They're overcharging me massively. When I find out the service charge, I'll tell people I know. They probably tacked on extra charges for the materials that aren't necessary.

So, 75 is getting a make-over! The city promised it, I don't see it happening. 275 needs it even more. It's all worn out, worn down, and costing me $360-ish. Stupid politics. And my gas tank hasn't been over half a tank in a month and money's tighter than even. Assholes. It's a federal crime to suggest harming the president, but someone needs to shake him and say ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOOOOIIIIINNNGGGGG?????!!!!!!!!"" There. I'm sure that won't hurt him. Though whoever shakes him will likely be shot at least forty times before hitting the ground, unless it's Karl Rove. I think Rove could shoot the Pope, shrug, and walk away without so much as a loud bitching by the left. Goddamn republicans. Goddamn oil. Goddamn it. Damn."

Regina tells me that Jennifer was talking about us again on her journal. I wasn't going to look but i decided it couldn't hurt. She deleted my comment I made, but didn't really say anything offensive. It sucks that she got laid off at her job. I've got mixed feelings over what's going on with her. I'm still hurt that she made wild assumtions that we didn't want her around, despite that we were trying to get back into her life. I wonder if she just didn't want friends who looked out for her in a way that made her feel like less. The drugs and drinking really concerned me.

I was thinking about when I bought some swords at Trader's World, and she blessed them for me. Plus I keep seeing cats online that look like blue. I just wish I knew why she suddenly hated Regina. I was there for everything, and I didn't see or hear Regina do any of the things Jennifer claims. Hell, we even talked about modifying the bridesmaid dress for her. Oh well. I didn't have the relationship they had. But it almost seems like when I came into Regina's life, Jennifer started pulling away from her.

I was going to post some songs on here, but I really don't feel like it now. I put together three folders of songs. Each folder is titled. <i> The First, Subjective Gravity,</i> and <i>The New One.</i> I need to call Pezze and bring some of them over to work on. We may make a virtual band, or just go as is.

Grilled swordfish steaks, marinated in white wine sauce, baked jumbo sea scallops basted with lemon pepper sauce, and shrimp noodles (aka shrimp flavored instant ramen soup, drained. Hah!) garnished with parsley flakes. I'll ask Adam (Aubrie's [sp?] boyfriend) if Bravo is stressful at all. I really only cook for pleasure, but if it pays enough, and isn't too bad, I'll consider going and trying to work at a classy restaurant. I guess Steak 'n' Shake traumatized me.

In other news, I worked with a total ass last night. This guy thinks that since he's only filling in for someone, he doesn't have to do any work while he's, um, working. So I end up do a mile-long walk every hour, with one of my ankles nearly bleeding from the horrid shoes that I thought were going to be comfy. Bullshit. Anyway, this guy was a strange looking fella': he seemed like a light-skinned black guy, but had the facial features of a white, deep-south-trailer-mutant. Not that I'm prejudice against those sorts, but when your family doesn't marry beyond 1st cousins for a dozen generations, then you get some odd folk. Anyway, this guy must have had some sort of impairment, because I had to ask what the hell he just said 15 times, or I'd just shrug and nod. To make things worse, he had three large, plastic grocery bags, one of which held nothing but two 2-Pac CDs and an alarm clock/CD player. The garbage was empty when I came in, and the can was full before I left. Maybe I'm just pissed that he flat out said ""I don't know about rounds or anything, I'm just filling in. I'm not doing any rounds."" But, damn he was a weird one.

"event","Okay. Scientology.
Creeps.
Me.
Out.

Since when can as sci-fi writer get thousands of people into a cult that's more destructive than the plagues? How?! And the movie stars... oh GOD what are they thinking? Y'know how they get into that shit? The scientologists pamper the living hell out of them and put them on a damn pedastal. Like they need more of that. You really need to check out www.xenu.net, Operation Clambake. It has lots of things about them. Also, check this out http://www.alldumb.com/item/12985/. The Daily Show gives a comical look into the mythos of scientology. Not entirely what I found on the cult's website, but close enough.

Now, there was a cult that it's people commited suicide when a certain comet came by the Earth once. Their leader was coo coo for cocopuffs too. It just amazes me, really, how people will believe anything you say. Kind of like christianity.

Oh come on! A burning bush? A fucking BUSH tells us it's God, and how to live? It was probably just a scam artist with a conscience, hiding behind the flames and smoke, who was sick of people bickering. And the virgin birth? Yeah, I'll believe this woman NEVER HAD SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN while her husband was away (who I think was sterile, but don't tell the church!). She had an affair, and the only way to save her self was to make up something, and well, since people were all listening to shrubery anyway, why not lie and say it was divinity?

Religions that come up with this kind of shit bore me, and piss me off. That's why I never liked going to church when I was little. It didn't make any damn sense. Sure, some people in these cults are nice people (I refer to all religions that feed us drek as cults). Many even learn something, though the majority just think that believing their pig-fuck ideas make them better than me. How about my friend who's relative beats her kids. She goes to church every week, never misses a beat, even talks in tongues when she's ""in the spirit.""

Since scientology represents such a threat to society, you'd think the catholic church, republicans, democrats, hippies, pagans, cynics, and everyone would band on a fight scientology, since it's already waaay exposed for driving people to suicide and depleting it's members' funds until they, well, die.

Oh well. It's not my concern. I'm not rich enough, or violent enough to do anything about it. I would suggest some guerilla warfar on their HQ's, but that'd be wrong, and we mustn't stoop even farther than thme. But dammit, if this was the middle ages, paladins and crown knights would march out and slaughter them. Maybe the government should simply pull a series of sting operations on them. Yeah... hey, that might make a good book. I'm going to start writing. Maybe if I write enough good books, I can tell people I'm enlightened, and start my own cult of derranged weirdos."

"event","Something's been brewing in my brain for the last few months, and it's about done. I read a lot of Newsweek and the Enquirer, and other random news magazines and papers, and each one has articles about this guy in office doing this, these people responding, and then these other guys talked and shook hands, patted each other on the back and told each other how the others shit doesn't stink, while one or both may hold a dagger above the others back. What I'm talking about is this invisible line of partisanship that makes each side automatically seem to hate the other. Since when have we come to use an objective approach to find political enemies? I certainly haven't seen it with President Bush and former President Clinton. Ann Coulter must be having a fit about that one, though she herself seems to think Bush is a moron. So why do I keep hearing these redneck accented business owners on political chatrooms bashing every left wing thing that there is? Their very own cowboy-hat-wearing spoiled rich kid has crossed the battlefield to shake a few hands, why can't they?

The word conservative. It brings to mind frugality, sensibility and reasoning. But what it has come to mean is narrow mindedness, bullying, and favoring money-making over peoples' lives.

Liberal. It would normally mean to me heavy application, not overkill, but well enough to get results. So why does it now mean to conserve resources and and a nearly do-whatever-but-harm-none attitude?

True conservatism and true liberalism are both dead or nearly so. There is no such thing as a full-time conservative. It's impossible. The moment you infringe on another's way of thinking or being, you are becoming radical and irresponsible. However, the other side of the coin in blank. There is no such thing as a full-time liberal, because that term simply can't apply to a democrat. Truth be told, both parties share so many of the same goals, there shouldn't even <i>be</i> two parties, but one. So what is the one thing holding these two apart? Religion.

Religion has done nothing but cause trouble for nearly ever civilization that made it's religion a priority. Christianity even isn't supposed to get politically involved, but has seen to change that idea to fit their agenda. When the idea that someone else doesn't accept <i>your</i> idea as the absolute end-all, they are a heretic. And here in America, anyone who isn't against gay marriage, every single form of abortion, and in some cases contraceptives, is a heretic in the eyes of (guess who?) the religious republican.

I once talked to a former democrat turned ""conservative"" in a chatroom, and this person told me that the republican party is pure, and the only chance this country has to make it, and that all democrats are corrupt, insane and think alike. ""Republicans are different,"" they said, ""we talk and debate on things."" I've seen this actually. Look at the senate, with some republicans siding with democrats. Some democrats side with the right on a few matters, particularly some economic ones. But I've never seen the right ask the left's opinion. Ann Coulter, that icon of brash words, cigarettes and wine, once said about democrats ""These are people who deliver a baby except the head, suck out its brain, and declare a constitutional right has been exorcised."" So, since when did all ""liberals"" become unlicensed, back-alley partial-birth abortion doctors? I think people really need to get some exposure to their targets before they fire.

Lastly, I'd just like to say that if this country turns into a monotheistic state, I'm leaving on the first plane, train, or whatever, just to get out. But the problem is, without what America stood for when it was founded, where do I go?"

"event","Well, I've had it with my weekday partner at the lab. He's just a total old geek.He's only in his mid 30s, but he hates any music made in the 80s, 90s, 00s, and probably anything after. He only likes music from the 70s, and his reasoning is that everyone else is a talentless-hack-garage-band. Why would this upset me? Well, I always hear people saying that music nowadays is terrible and no one has any skill anymore. These very same people <b>DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO TODAY'S MUSIC.</b> So how can they possibly pass judgment on everything? It's not just music though, people do this with everything. ""Oh, I don't like any remakes of movies, they all suck-"" <b><i>FUCK YOU!!</b></i> Have you <i>seen</i> every remake? Do you <i>watch</i> the whole damn thing? A lot of music and movies suck now. A lot of music and movies sucked <i>then</i>. Get over it, and listen to or watch some new shit. What's really going on isn't that everyone sucks, it's that you're clinging to all of your old memories because you're feeling old. You're not old!! Well, you are if you're 60 or something, unless you don't act old. Anyhow, that's my bitching about them. Thank you.

Now I'll discuss how I hate the government.... well, I've done that before, bitching about the two party system that blows green, random goat balls, but this is new. I just figured out that I pay 18.76 of my pay check to them. You know how much it would save me to have just a little more than 12.8 of that back? That's 2% of my ANNUAL pay back. It does not help. I'm more than willing to bet I'm getting fucked somewhere in the numbers, and if we could get some of the fucking money that got cut for the rich business owners, no one would be in this mess. Some jackass on a chat room told me that Bush's tax cuts got him out of credit card debt. We good for you :). I don't have a fucking credit card, nor do I qualify for one or really even want one, I don't have any fucking health insurance, and I'm not a very healthy person. That very same jackass may not have realized that if they'd gotten the tax cut themselves, it would have gotten people with serious health issues and medical debt in the clear. How the fuch DID they get anything out of those cuts I wonder? Could it be that they were in the loop with their employer? Well, great! People who work for honest huge businesses can get help! Whilst the rest of us get raped by the economy.

Bush talks like he's going to hand cash out of his own pocket to help people go to college or tech school, but you know he's lying out of his ass. Tuition is getting higher and higher, and no republican wants to fund someone else who could be a potential threat. So maybe if you wrote to him you were going to bible school or something to dispel the lies about this ""evolution"" thing. Seriously. I hate the Bush administration more than I hate... well, there's nothing to really compare that to. Kind of exceeds everything."

It's been a while since my last post. I've been depressed and anxious, exited and busy, and quite frankly, I've been thinking far more than I should be. Though I'm totally exited and happy about getting married, I keep putting off doing things like calling UC to see if I need to take the ACT or SAT, or whatever, and I've been putting off getting the tuxes for the groomsmen and myself (though I'm going with my brother as soon as he calls me today). I want to write my stories, but I don't have the capacity to do so just yet. My vocal range has improved in notes I can carry, but I've lost that unique sound my voice used to have. I've started writing songs again, but only in pieces. Like I can't see through the veil that separates my conscious mind from that place I get my songs. I feel too stuck in the material world, worrying about our finances and future, freaking out at my own procrastination... I'm out of touch with that other me.

Oh well. Some things are good (those that aren't great or totally screwed up).

It just makes me feel so afraid and vulnerable that I can't connect with that primal, ethereal essence I was known for perceiving before I had things to worry about. And worse, I'm spending so much time worrying that I'm not getting anything done anyway. I'm starting to feel like I just can't function in 'normal' society. That's what's scary. I'd fit in better in some era like the Dark Ages or something, where people like myself would have a place in the world outside our homes.

I'm just rambling I suppose. I'll post this in Shadows as well. Someone there will sympathize, or imagine they can at least. I really don't know how anyone can accurately describe this kind of terrible discontent. Again, it's the blind, the one-eyes, the liars and lied-to. No one's ever to blame for trying, but each is to blame when we fail.

"event","My friends, I'm certain most of you understand what's going on in the battle of republicans vs democrats, and here's a scary one. I don't know if you've heard about the ""nuclear option"" that Bush is pushing for, but it basically assures that his nominees (especially supreme court) that require a senate vote will always go through, regardless of what the democratic senator say, and regardless of what americans do. Imagine a supreme court full of nothing but republicans. I have a feeling that any democratic or middle judges will go the way that the former head of the committee of energy company regulations: mysteriously fired. If you want to do something to help, go to this link <a href=""http://www.tedkennedy.com/page/petition/nomyers?PHPSESSID="">Help Out</a>  and speak up. Some republican journalist have said that democrats are ""fighting dirty"" by only voting on those nominees who aren't corrupt and dangerous to our health. They approved 57 percent of Bush's nominees, what the hell do they want?! It's scary to think what Bush is doing, <i>and</i> getting away with. I've joined <i>Move On PAC</i>, <i>Working America</i>, and some others to try and be heard for a change. These things affect us all, because once the republican party has all three branches of government (for they have the executive and legislative already, just look it up), we're all going to be easily submitted to <i>their</i> ways of thinking. We'll have to live <i>their</i> way, by <i>their</i> rules. Freedom isn't something I think I can simply give up.

If I saw the word lobster anymore in this entry, I may turn into one.

Anyhow, we've partly decided on what to do for the wedding, as we had been considering do the justice of the peace thing. I don't want to do that, because it seems too clinical to me. I want a celebration. So, Jessica, you'll have to come up here and marry us. We may do the ceremony at Eden Park, rather than a church, because churchs are damn expensive to rent, and I have a thing against churchs.

In other news, there's been a death in my family: my cousin died. I had just started to get to know this other side of my family that I actually like. She stopped breathing, and as far as I know, they don't know why. The funeral was supposed to be today, but it's being held in Lexington, so I couldn't make it. So I went and drowned my sorrows in grilled... seafood. Anyway, I'm going to chill until work."

I got on www.renderosity.com and started looking up stuff. I've always wanted to make renders of all those damn characters in my head. So I'm really considering taking classes in college to help me learn how to work with rendering programs. I had this idea for a near-futuristic character and a scene I've always wanted to do. It's kind of a no-frills super-spy type thing. Lots of violence, lots of weird characters. Anyhow... Poser 5 is like, $200!! Only if that second job I'm looking for pays me enough to have extra stuff like ungodly expensive software will I get that. 'till then, I'mma just have my brother burn me some disks with his 3d rendering programs. I'll just play with pulling and pinching shoddy polygonal crap for a while.

I wonder how long of a post I can make without really saying anything at all? I mean, this one's botched already, because I gave a modicum of an update, if the word ""modicum"" even aplies to that sentence. Lemme know, because I'm too damn lazy to look up the proper context.

Oh! I learned how to sing ""Zombie"" by The Cranberries. I kbew the words by heart, but as a male, I had to adjust my voice and the way the song is sung itself in order not to sound all goofy. I think I do fairly well, but I'm always too nervous to sing new songs in front of people. Even in front of Regina I get nervous, and all smiley and start laughing. I think there are multiple reasons for my nervousness, because when I overcome one thing, I'm still nervous. Don't ask how I can tell if I've overcome one of them. I just know, like you know when someone's looking at you naked.

*sigh* I'm having trouble writting anything too. I keep getting depressed, even still. I think it's the long hours of work where all I do is just try to keep myself amused. That shit gets to a person. Anyhow, I'm gonna lay down. We gots D&D tonight. Maybe I'll be a jerk and cancel again... lol. Nah. If anything, I may see if people would rather have made their own characters, and start over. I don't think it was wise of me to make them all. For one reason, I threw some enemies at the players, and they wiped the floor with the enemies. One character even ran off (Regina got sleepy), and they STILL came out unscathed (with the exception of Melissa. Her character got hit by a sling bullet). Oh well, I'm new to this god thing, and I'll just have to get used to things not being easy for the disposables.

I haven't written on here in a while, and I think I just figured out why, as I lay in bed, feeling the sleeping pill I took try to overcome the caffeine and nerves. My life just isn't that exiting. I mean, it is to me, when I'm here at home, but work, and D&D, and such doesn't seem to be worth writting about. However, I have news: I've been going to a chiropractor, and discovered some joints in my back are messed up, and I ave a rotated disc in my neck. It's not too bad, because I'm young, so I'm just going to go every so often. It's weird having joints popped that I hadn't popped since I was 13, or even knew about. Uh hmm...

So this new post is working out. I'm at UC's Genome Research Institute. It's pretty cool. I work with a veteran nerd most of the week, but he's a little creepy. Then, I work with this creepy 45-ish white guy sexaholic who thinks he's black. Man, he freaks me out. He's a bad influence on me too, always trying to convince me to leave the post for various reasons.

Roleplaying stuff! Tell me if this would be weird: if a blind man with a bandage over his eyes stares at you for a while, then gives you a coin with your face on it. That's what happened to my character, Cypher. One side of the coin has a bandit mask, and when he flips the coin, it looks like he's wearing it.
Other rpg stuff... I'm having trouble deciding what I want to do with these people I'v talked to about playing Anime d20. I don't <i>want</i> to GM that one, I want to GM d20 Modern. The players I've gathered are: Jack, Megan (Jack's girl), Virgil, Penis Killer, Regina, maybe Beard, and I forget if there's anyone else.I don't even know how I'm going to do this. Most of these people have no way to get here. Matter of fact, I don't even know if <i>any</i> of them do. So, we'll see what happens.

I'm very exited about looking for churches with Regina, but I sleep whenever she's home, and it really bothers me. With her being up early on the weekend, and my taking one more sleeping pill than I should have the other day, I can't seem to manage a normal sleep schedule. I've slept 2.5 hours today. and I can't sleep, even with one pill. Two puts me way to under. I don't know what to do anymore. anyhow, I gotta pee, and then I'm going to amuse myself by setting dead bodies on fire or something. Now, where did I put those...?......."

Well, she's getting a rude awakening tomorrow when I show up and scream my fucking lungs out at her.

So damn sick of this shit. Perfect way to end a perfect week. Possibility of dying yet again."

"event","Well, got my check in da mail. Not too shabby, but just shabby enough to not <i>be</i> enough. Turns out 1st Choice <i>does</i> give vacations, and I <i>am</i> considered to be full time. However, that doesn't explain why I'm still nearly broke all the time. What does? They don't pay enough. Soon, very soon, I will say goodbye to 1st Choice.

Oh, and that vacation time? 1 week for 1 year, and two weeks for 3 years. If I stick with them, I may be able to go on vacation in June."

"event","Okay, here's my week:
<lj-cut>- Car ran into snowbank, had to walk 1 mile through freezing rain without proper clothing. Got tow.
- Worked 1st shift for the first time in ages. But before I get there, car doors are frozen shut. Guardian angel gives me a hand and lets my car warm up so I can get in it, and back out of the snow.
- Slept way too much, and no shopping done.
- Regina's car stuck. Neighbors help, and we are late for X-Mas Eve with her family. On way to her mom's, my car is stuck, and I get a tow from a stranger and make it to work instead, since time had run out.
- X-Mas day, we are late getting to my grandma's, and I <i>think</i> Regina's car gets stuck, but we get it out. After she leaves, my car is stuck, AND has a flat tire. We leave it at my grandma's and I go to work, planning to fix it the next day.
- We check my car's tire size, and go get a tire from Walmart, what they said was cheapest, but really second most expensive. Get back to car, passenger side window broken into, license plate stolen. Police tell me I can't make the report because they're only taking emergency calls. Tow takes way too long to come, so we cancel it.
- Next day, tow doesn't happen again, and we make a report to HPD. We go to Jekyll & Hyde's and I drink two long island ice teas, get very drunk, amused by the new  feeling, but slightly worried (although my faculties didn't alert the rest of me I was worried). Get White Castle's. Bad idea. Get sick while Regina's driving, and puke in the bags. Acid eats through, and it falls all over myself and the seat. Once home, violently puke some more.
- Today: hung over, depressed, pissed and car-less. I look in the dryer for Regina had put my clothes in it. Wallet, keys, and cell phone still in pockets. Cell phone destroyed, wallet nasty.</lj-cut>

I really don't know what to do anymore. I must have pissed somebody off. Probably one of those ""powers that be."""

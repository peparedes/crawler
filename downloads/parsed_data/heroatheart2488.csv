"event","So last night was realy sweet, Nate and I and Ben, shot random things such as, pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, balls of gum, peanuts, creme savers, and metal balls at a pyramid of old pop cans that were put on nates wooden driveway railing thing. It was sweet, and we bought some tennis balls and threw them at eachother and hit them with peices of wood from nates fireplace, and we played crotch ball which, may i say, is a very retarded thing to do, unless your incredibly bored, then its pretty much the most amazing game. Can you belive that family dollar and cvs both dont sell whiffel balls and whiffel ball bats? i mean come on...."

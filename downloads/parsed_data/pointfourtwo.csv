I wish things could be different. I wish we could be as close as we used to be. But... I don&#39;t think you want that any more. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever read this and I&#39;m not sure it will ever make any difference. But you were an amazing friend. I don&#39;t know what went wrong... I&#39;m sorry if it was me.

I can only reach out for so long before I think that there&#39;s no one left to reach for. You were my best friend and you were always there for me. Thank you for that.

I hope one day you come back and we can be friends again. But I can&#39;t keep reaching out into the dark any more.

If not... thank you for the memories.

As much as you may not believe it, I do miss you.

...Bye bye."

"event","<p>The walk was long and hard. Scott didn&#39;t mind that. However, it would also seem that the journey was turning up to be quite fruitless. However, everything was about to change.

The sun was now setting and the shadows were slowly reaching out, engulfing Scott. He turned, not quite quick enough to see the building collapse. As heavy bricks fell onto him, Scott could do nothing but brace for the impact.

As he let the world around him collapse in on him again, all he could do was pray, wait and muse over things so far.

He probably hadn&#39;t thought this through as much as he should. The further he walked, the more he realised that nothing may very well come of this little journey.

He had been so prepared. So untouchable. But no matter how prepared you are, it would seem that there were always those unexpected twists that you couldn&#39;t possibly predict. Nothing in life is a sure bet. You just have to learn to enjoy your winning streaks and roll with the punches when they come.

Life... Life is complicated. Scott found that out&nbsp;a long time ago. And just when everything seemed to be okay, that&#39;s when it bites you in the ass. It&#39;s all well and good to build up your walls and protect yourself. But what people don&#39;t account for is that...it doesn&#39;t just take you letting your walls down to hurt you; with the slightest of pushes, anybody could quite easily topple your own walls down upon you.</p><p>Life... Life is a bitch.</p><p>Scott knew she&#39;d be here soon. He knew she&#39;d rescue him again. She was his centre. She would make him whole. But until then, Scott had nothing much more to do than muse of his past...</p><p>Now, where had this all began?</p>"

"event","<p>He opened his eyes, suddenly aware of the sweeping breeze. He had no idea how long he had been lying there, battered and broken...For all he knew it could have been hours, days, weeks...<i>or more.</i> Sitting up, he looked around, taking in his surroundings. Decay, death and destruction. Those three words summed it up the most. However, looking ahead, the sun was beginning to rise and it filled him with a sense of hope. The path ahead was clear and unbroken; yet shadows filled his mind. Surely it couldn&#39;t be this easy? Surely it was not a simple matter of getting up and walking on? After all he had been through; all the pain...this was it? All he had to do was walk? He smiled to himself, musing over the irony of the situation.

Still seated on the floor, he looked behind him. It was all so...ugly. It was nothing but a mess now. The walls had crumbled and burned long ago. His old life had ended and now stood like those ruins as a monument of the past; a reminder never to fall back into those traps. He knew that as soon as the sun rested back on the horizon, the shadows of his past would creep towards him again, urging him to come back. 

But everything was different now. 

Scott stood, turning fully to face the ruins of his past life. What had happened was magical; he couldn&#39;t deny that. He had fallen so deep into that chasm that he had given up hope of ever finding his way home. And so he had plunged further, determined that if he was going to fall, he was going to make a big bang when he landed. But just as he neared the bottom, she had swept him away. She had&nbsp;come from nowhere and turned everything around. She had saved him.

He turned again to face the sun. The path was so clear and distinct. Scott looked uneasy. He could easily walk that path right now; walk away from his past and into the light, into his new life. The life he had been waiting for. However, he knew that there were some things that he would like to take with him from his past. People, memories... Not everything that stood behind him was dark and broken. There were still people among the rubble that he would rather not leave behind.

Scott turned again, looking into the darkness. He knew it was a path he shouldn&#39;t tread. He knew he might get lost...but whatever the problem, he knew she would save him again and she would deliver him back here. He had to try. <i>He had to.</i> He had always been taught never to give up so easily. The journey could very well be fruitless, he could quite easily return empty handed. But he <i>would</i> return. He just had to try. This was to be his last great endevour, and then he would simply ride on into the sunset.

He knew that it was dark in there. He knew that it was easy to lose yourself. But he was a different man now. The darkness would not be able to touch him so long as he stayed focused. He just hoped that those he was searching for had seen the same light he had and were headed his way. His path might not necessarily be the same as theirs, but they were still people he valued in his life, and he had to let them know that. He had to at least show them where he was going so that they might meet him along the way.

It was now or never.

Scott took a step forward and amost immediately the shadows washed over him. But he was unaffected. He smiled, more confident now, and took another step. Scott heard something up ahead. Something moving, perhaps? No, definitely a cry of some kind. Some strange, warped hissing. Scott slowly approached to see a lowly dying snake. It had been wounded; nothing major, but without treatment it would surely die.

The snake slowly moved towards Scott in a plea for help. Scott bent and picked up the snake in his hands. It&#39;s pleading&nbsp;face turned to him; the snake was weak and had been writhing there for God only knows how long. Scott knew where to find food and water; he could heal this snake. He could save it. He could change it&#39;s life...

Looking thoughtful for a moment, Scott looked at the snake with curious eyes. In one swift motion, he broke the snake&#39;s neck. The snake felt nothing and died immediately. Dropping the snake&#39;s lifeless body to the ground, Scott stepped back onto the path, once more facing the darkness. Scott had learned well. He was here not to save&nbsp;others but to rebuild the bridges that had been burned. He was looking into his own past and was not about to embark on some journey down some mysterious new path down which he had never been before. He would find them and he would return. Then he would walk forward. All he could do was to show them where he was going. He couldn&#39;t make them come with him; but if they choose to do so then they should at least know where to find him.

Scott felt the bitter breeze once more and drew his cloak tightly around him. The brilliant red was a stark contrast against the darkness. He&#39;d chosen this particular item for a reason. Hopefully <i>she</i> would know what it meant. That it was an olive branch and a symbol. A statement that though a lot had changed, some things had stayed the same. He hoped it would show that he understood what was happening, and that he wanted her friendship once more, regardless. She had given him&nbsp;a choice once before but then made another choice for him. He understood and respected that but wasn&#39;t going to let her walk away so easily. Good friends are hard to come by, and life is an awful road to travel alone.

As he started to walk deeper and deeper into the darkness, he noticed an odd shadow on the wall. It appeared to be a man with something on his back, perhaps a child. &quot;Someone ought to warn him,&quot; Scott mused and laughed to himself.

Everything was going to be okay.</p>"

"event","This isn't directed at anybody, nor is it for anybody's benefit but mine. I feel I've spent far too long holding back, leaving things out and I shouldn't... I need to get everything out; I can't keep it inside any longer. You don't want to read, then don't. If you do, then I warned you and I'm sorry. I... I need to find me again, and I can't do that until I clear away everything else.<br /><br /><br /><br />My mind is racing, cycling through everything. But one thing doesn't tell the whole story, so I look back to the previous one, but that just leads to another and another and another...it's like some giant web that I can't get out of. I wanted to come here so... I just...<br /><br />I want to live life. I really want to be just living life; experiencing things. I go home and my sister gets back from work and she's so happy, telling my family about her day, all the stuff that has happened... Everyone seems so proud of her for seeing what she wants and going for it. And she got it. She's got a good job; a job that she loves. I wish I could do that. But no matter what I do they just seem to put me down. I'm never doing enough work, anything I'm doing is pointless... I feel like such a burden on them. I just want them to be proud of me... I never thought I'd need that from them. I never thought it would matter to me, but it does. I feel like I'm wasting time here, I want to go and look for what I want. I'm tired of watching from afar. I don't like it any more. Japanese was a skill I wanted to learn. It's not a career choice I want to follow. I don't know what I want right now, but I'm not going to find it here. I need to go and look... I just want them to be proud of me...<br /><br />I want to go and get a job. If I don't like it then I'll go and look for something else. I want to find something that's going to make me happy. Something that's going to make me feel as if I'm DOING something. If I want to, I'll learn Japanese, Philosophy...I learn anything I want in my free time, but I can't make that my only objective in life. I want to find something that makes me feel...makes me feel like I'm <i>living </i>life again. While I'm here... I don't know. I enjoy the course. I like that I'm learning the language, but I don't feel like I belong here. I don't feel like this is me right now...<br /><br />I don't really know what I am any more.<br /><br />I want to, and I'm going to, leave. I want to go an get a job and find what I want in life. Find something that makes me feel whole. I need it. I need it before I completely fall to pieces. It's taking so much to hold it all together... But what happens when I'm off the course? Do I leave my accommodation straight away? Do I have time? I already paid 'til January, I think. What happens? How much time do I have? Do I have to keep paying after I leave? I don't understand... I need to talk to the Uni. I will tomorrow...I'll find out then...I hope. I think if I get this sorted it will be a huge weight off my shoulders.<br /><br />I feel so pathetic that I want their... I just hate that I want them to be proud of me. I've never needed it before, but these past few weeks, every ""Why do you never have your plans set out?"" and every ""Stop doing that, it's stupid"" they've cut really deeply... I don't know why. It never used to be like this. Before, it wouldn't bother me; I'd go as far as to say that they never did this before, and maybe that's true too. Perhaps, seeing how my sister has sorted her life out...perhaps now I'm the one in her shadow...<br /><br />So I guess it's time that I moved the sun.<br /><br />I was once told that if I didn't want to be in somebody's shadow, that I need not strive to step out of it, I meerly change the position of the sun. I think that is something I'm always going to live by... If I want to make myself seen, make myself noticed; then I need to change the rules. I need to do something new. Something people have to see. I think that's not only something to do with the whole Uni business, but my entire life. I need to apply it to everything...<br /><br /><br /><br />I miss wrestling. The brief times I do it, I do really enjoy. I enjoy Jitsu, and most martial arts...but nothing really makes me feel happy like I do when I'm in the ring. I need to find what I lost and carry on pursuing it. I don't think I'm great. I don't even think I'm good. I think the best I will go to is to admit that I'm okay sometimes. That's as much as anyone will ever get out of me. I...I want to be something special. I want to be something different. Something people haven't seen before. I think I can do it, I just need to find it first... Hopefully once I'm back in Hull, I'll be able concentrate more on this.<br /><br /><br /><br />Vicky...I'm torn betw-...I-...I really don't know what to say here. I wish it hadn't ended, and I regretted it ending the way it did. I wanted it to be something more but...maybe we just didn't...maybe we were just too different. Maybe we were just two different people on two different paths that happened to cross at a certain point. I don't know. I wish it... I don't want to hurt you any more yet that's all I seem to be doing. I don't want to. I don't want to hurt anybody but... I wanted to get everything out here, but I'm not sure I'll ever know how I feel. But right now I can't decide anything for definite. I don't know what I want. But I don't want to put you through this. I don't want to hurt you, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be with you. Just because I want to be with you, doesn't mean I think I should be with you, that it will work or that I'm going to do anything about it... I want to be with you, but I don't want you to have to be with me. It's not fair. Truth is, I WILL put you through this again. I will feel like this again eventually, I will take on more than I can handle and I will collapse again, and I'll drag you down with me again. I can't keep putting you through that. I don't even know if this makes any sense to you but... I don't think we really understand each other enough to really trust the other person. We don't understand why we are the way we are... I'm not saying anything in this. There's no big revelation here. This is just a small part of the thoughts going through my head, I'm trying to decipher them but I can't. I don't know what any of it means. I don't know what I want. I don't really know who *I* am. I think it's natural to always have that doubting voice inside your head, and you'll always have your voice telling the doubting one to shut up. But I don't know which voice is mine any more. Am I the one doubting everything or am I the voice telling the other one to shut up? And there are so many other sides with so many different opinions...I don't know which one is me. I'm lost in a sea of thoughts and I want so desperately to get out, but I don't know which way to swim.<br /><br /><br /><br />The next one...really isn't a problem to me as such. I don't know. It...causes problems, I suppose, but it's not something I feel I'm willing to change... Basically, I have my ex living with my family and the only way that bothers me is when it comes to relationships. When I was with her she got kicked out of her house. She was...well, not treated very well at home, and she had no one else. I let her move in and stay there when I moved out. I let her stay there now that we've broken up and as much as anyone my hate it, there is no way I can make her leave. Right now, my family are the only family she has...and they're the only real family she's ever had. She feels...part of something, I guess, and I don't think she's ever felt accepted like that before. She seems comfortable there and everyone else seems happy to have her there. It's not about her being my ex, it's not about having any kind of history...it's about someone I know needing help. Someone vulnerable, someone that has nothing else in the world to cling on to... There's so much that I know that I can't talk about here, but my best judgement tells me that she's better here than out there. I feel like I've pulled her up out of so much darkness, there is no way I would ever throw someone back into that. I... I don't know. Seeing her with my family, she looks happy. She seems to really enjoy life and that something I don't think I saw in her before. She looks like she feels welcome and accepted, and I refuse to tear that away from her. I could never make someone unhappy; I could never tear everything away from someone so that they had nothing left. I'm not sure if everyone would do the same, but I hope that anyone that really truly understood me would understand why I have to do this. I feel like I'm making a difference in somebody's life. This isn't out of any gain for me, I gain nothing from this. But by doing this I feel that I'm making a person's life worthwhile. I'm actually helping somebody...and I could never tear that away from them.<br /><br />I think this is something that I talk about a lot because it's something that I'm not sure people really understand. I think if any of my friends came to me and they had absolutely nowhere to go and were in a similar position to Anya...I'd do it for them too. I could never allow somebody to fall into a situation where so much bad stuff could happen. I could never leave someone out there on their own when they're so vulnerable. I have to help them. It's going to take a lot from that person to make me change my mind; but someone so undeserving of a life like that...I could never throw them into it. I don't think the world is fair. Karma may exist but I don't think the balance has to be at neutral, or even on an individual level. I think sometimes people have a bad life where they just keep hitting the wrong situations and find themselves in a bad place. I can't let... I could never tear somebody's life apart like that.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm not really sure what else to say. I'm tired of talking about all of this and I guess I do feel a little better...there will probably be a part two coming soon... We'll see, I guess...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />""How can I even cast a shadow if you change the position of the sun?"" - Renegade"

I'm thinking that's perhaps a good thing... But at the same time I feel like she's still affecting far too much in my life. I can't really go home because she's still there...and she's starting to affect more than just me going home. I'm more that happy to stay at my grandparents' when I'm back in Hull; if anything, I prefer it. But it's the fact that her presence in my life is starting to affect my relationship that it begins to bother me. I don't want to just kick someone out with nowhere and no one else to go to...but at the same time I don't want her to keep affecting things. It's killing me that I feel like I can't do anything to...I don't know. I really don't know. I hate all of this. I hate it all. I hate that I'm making people hurt. I hate myself. I really do. I hate the way I am and the fact that I really don't know what I can do about it.<br /><br />At the heart of things, I feel like I'm useless. I try to help, I really do. I don't think everyone needs help, but when someone has a problem that is obviousl-....<br /><br />AND I WISH THEY WOULD STOP TRYING TO FUCKING TALK TO ME WHEN I OBVIOUSLY DO NOT CARE AND CAN'T FUCKING HEAR THEM.<br /><br />...-obviously affecting them. I just want people to be happy. I don't know why, that's just the way I am. Sometimes I feel like people hate me for it, but there's nothing I can do about it. I know it's fucking up my own life, I just don't know what to do.<br /><br />I feel like my family expect me to become so much more than I want from life. I feel like they expect me to achieve all of this and that they're going to hate me if I don't. They don't say it, but I feel it. I don't want to disappoint them. I don't want...I don't want anything. I don't want to be where I am now. I don't want to have to do all of this. I want to just live life, do things that I like doing. I-...<br /><br />I hate this.<br /><br />I really do.<br /><br />I don't know what to do. I wish I did. I wish I knew how to fix everything, but I don't. I hate that I'm so fucking stupid that I can't live my own life. I hate that I can't see a clear path any more. I hate that I flatout refuse to let anyone help me, and I hate that I don't know where I'm going...<br /><br />I want to wrestle. I want to do martial arts. I want to travel. I want to write a book. I want to write a comic book. That's everything I want from life. Am I overcomplicating things by going to University? Can I achieve all of that WITHOUT Uni? I don't want to quit again. I love learning languages. But maybe I'm best doing it on my own terms. I don't give a shit about completing tasks and learning History and picking other modules from some other course I really can't be arsed with. I'd rather the language come to me on it's own. I'd rather discover the history, the interesting parts that I like to know. I want to live my life by my rules. I believe in that so strongly, but when I'm being told how to do everything...I feel too pressured. I hate being pressured to do anything.<br /><br />I hate the fact that I have to...I don't know, ""tap in"" to everything inside me when I draw. And I hate that it sometimes gets out of control and makes me feel this way. It's like sometimes I get too much emotion all at once and I start getting all arsey, I push everyone away and I piss a lot of people off. I don't mean to, but I suddenly start feeling invaded. Everyone and everything pisses me off. I feel like they're all trying to make me worse and they're just... I dunno.<br /><br />I want to be able to cope with things on my own. I'm aware that I need to talk to people. But recently everything in my head just feels so fragmented. I don't know what path to take any more, or how to get onto that path. I don't know who I am or how to...to...<br /><br />I feel like everything is slipping away from me. Everything I want is slipping away. I can't talk to anyone any more. I don't know what to tell them or how to explain myself. I don't know how to tell people why I am the way I am, and in most cases I don't know myself. <br /><br />I wish this was easier. I wish I wasn't so much of a fucking loser that I didn't have to...<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />I just wish I knew what to do. I just wish I could see again..."

"event","It's like knowing a wall inch by inch; every single flaw, bump, crevice of that wall logged in your mind. You know it perfectly. But then, when you go to take a closer look, you see a small mark. You go to remove the mark and discover what's underneath; the single last part of the wall that you never truly saw. But as you go to wipe away the mark the wall cumbles into pieces and all that you ever knew lies in a mess at your feet; in it's place lies a cavern. Full of a darkness that you could never fully explore...a darkness that you never want to explore because the moment it grips you, you know it will never let you go.

I never saw this coming. Last time I suspected for a while, I saw things wrong and it was easy to cut the ties. But this time I turned and it hit me like a...well, like a big yellow school bus. This time I didn't see it coming, I failed in everything I've ever taught myself. Always be aware... But this one came so fast and so hard that I had no time to prepare; and I'm going to suffer for it. Right now, part of me feels so beaten down; so down and out that it doesn't feel as if it will ever be the same again. Part of me wants to just give up right now, lay in the gutter and die.

But yet there's still that shining light. There's still that power that forces me to help others...and I know that this time it's going to help me. What was once a help to others is now going to help me, I know it is. I know that it will help me back to my feet... I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna come right back at you just a little smarter, licking my wounds, not wanting to get my ass beat like I did the last time.

The part of me the drives me now is a part of me that you will never get your hands on. A part that you will never touch. I used to think that I was somehow making a difference; that I was making your life brighter, but I now realise that mine was only getting darker.

Because sometimes...

<lj-embed id=""2"" />

...because sometimes, you just have to keep on fighting. This world ain't waiting for anyone; this train don't stop for no one, so if you get knocked off then you get yourself right back on it, or you might just miss it.

"event","The <b>Hero Complex</b> is a <b><u>compulsion to help others</u></b> and <b><u>make the world right.</u></b> Although not officially considered a disorder or disease, there is an increasing number of people who 'suffer' from it. Many fictitious heroes and main characters seem to have this as well, but note that there is a difference between helping others out of choice and feeling compelled to. It may also be associated with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoological_Altruism&amp;action=edit"" class=""new"" title=""Zoological Altruism"">Zoological Altruism</a>- Instinctive cooperative behavior that is <b><u>detrimental to the individual</u></b> but contributes to the survival of close relatives, thus making it more likely to be passed on.<br /><u><i><br /><br /><br />Traits</i></u><br /><br />Those who have a ""Hero Complex"" <b>tend to feel that the current life they live is insufficient.</b> For most, the need will ebb and flow. There will be days where <b>they will ask questions</b> like why they have had the role thrust upon them, <b>if what they're doing is really going to make a difference, and sometimes even why they care in the first place</b>.<br /><br />Many believe that <b>they could do more if they had the means to</b>, whether it is in terms of money, power, or something else held in prestige. Most wait quietly believing that someday they will find these means, although <b>some go out to ""find"" them on their own</b>. <u><b>They also often ask the question 'is this really enough?' or 'am I doing the right thing?'</b></u> Usually such questions have a demoralizing effect, but many who have the Hero Complex <b>will be motivated to find these answers</b>. They are <b>very loyal and dependable</b>, and<b> <u>when given a challenge will almost always find a way to complete it</u></b>...if they see it as a useful challenge. These traits make them great leaders and friends, for their extensive thought process makes them <b>great at <u>giving advice</u> and opinions in addition to lending their abilities and talents when they can</b>. However, the universal respect societies have for such people leads many to ignore the negative implications. Their high standards might not only carry the risk of <u><b>overextending themselves and causing depression and withdrawal</b></u>, they might lead the individual to become destructive (see ""Villain Complex"".)<br /><br />In fulfilling these desires, they will take on a more benevolent behavior, and 'unlock' the true meanings of themselves. This is the true need of those who have a Hero Complex. Excellent examples of this are David Dunn of Unbreakable, Harry Potter, Goku from Dragon Ball Z, and Batman.<br /><br /><br /><u><i>Causes</i></u><br /><br />While not everyone who has been disappointed at some point in their lives will develop a hero complex, almost everyone with one has been in some way or another. One cause may be <b><u>trying to atone for a sense of worthlessness</u></b>. This sense may be caused by underlying stress from the inability to complete certain everyday tasks. Alternatively, because of the lack of modern-day heroes, the sufferer may be trying to compensate for a loss of 'icons' in modern societies, and they look inward instead of outward for their own gratification. They may <b><u>feel guilt for not helping others in the past,</u></b> or they may have felt pain at a previous point in their lives and are motivated by fear of seeing that pain inflicted on others.<br /><br /><br /><u><i>Coping</i></u><br /><br />Although there is no ""treatment"", <b>many look for ways to find release from their troubled worlds instead of having to confront it</b>. Often, a release can be found in<b><u> video games</u></b>, because of their allowance for one to enact heroic roles, or in personifications of heroes (i.e. <b><u>Movies and comics or role-playing</u></b>). The effects are not permanent, but can lead to an addiction to false realities. Perhaps the best thing for ""victims"" to do is accept there are some things we cannot change and others just need time. At other times, the best thing to do is to try to make a change, as long as the goal is within reach. Remember, there is a difference between wanting to help others and feeling compelled to.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Compulsion to help others, wrestling - playing a different person, video games, comics, detrimental to the individual... Explains a lot. Maybe I really do have it...<br /><br />Hmm.<br /><br /><br />""There's nothing left to prove, there's nothing I won't do, nothing like the pain I feel for you..."""

"event","I've never really put myself first. I've always tried to put everyone else first. I've always tried to do what's best for everyone else. But when it comes to the direction of my life, I have to push on. I have to keep on going, no matter what.

This is right for me. Manchester, I mean. It all feels right. It all feels so familiar, and for me that suggests that I'm on the right path. I can't let anything or anyone make me stop this. I need to stick with this. I need to live my life...

I tried to help. I helped every way I could. But it never seemed enough. I gave up everything I had. The only thing I kept for myself was my pursuit of the life that I've always wanted, yet it seems that I'm asked to give that up too. But I can't. No matter what, I can't. I've given up too much already. I've given almost everything I have. And it's certainly taken it's toll on me. It's affected me more than anything has before. I've given so much for nothing in return. I've given it all to help someone. I gave it all to help make someone's life just that little bit better. Someone who had nothing in this world... But now it comes down to a choice between continuing to give and giving up my life, or continuing with my life and taking it all away from her.

Does that make me selfish? Is there something inherently wrong in putting my life first? I know that I've made an impression, but it hardly seems enough. I just wish there was more I could do.

In all honesty, I've never found anything in my life so hard as I have this. This has been my greatest challenge. I tried everything I could do to make things right...but you can't change what has already happened. You can't change a person's past. And if you can't change the past, does it necessarily follow that you can't change the person either? I tried to change her, but for once I don't think itwas wrong. I was changing her for the better. Not for me but for her. I was trying to show her a better side of life. But I feel now that it's too much for me.

I feel like I'm abandoning her. Just casting her out when she still really needs someone. I feel so selfish. So selfish because I refuse to give up my life. But I know that if I did this, it would be something I'd regret for the rest of my life. I know that in doing this I wouldn't be able to be happy with my life, and I don't want to live a life of regret. I want to accomplish all that I can. But is it inherently bad that I'm doing this all for me, neglecting the feelings of others?

I wish there was another way, I really do. But this is something I have to do... I've given everything else up, but I can't give this up too.

Not this time.

"event","I could so easily make my life so much easier right now. I could make myself so much happier...yet I won't let myself do it. Maybe I think I don't deserve to be happy, like some eternal quest for salvation. Maybe I just feel like I need to go through all of this before I can truly be the person I'm supposed to be.

I know this is my fault. I shouldn't be so eager to try and help. 9 times out of 10, in the end I only make everything worse. It could all be so easy. But I feel like I have to stick with this. This is my mess and I have to sort it all out right?

...right?

"event","I commented your journal and got no reply. You didn&#39;t even acknowledge that I&#39;d said anything.

Then when you commented me on myspace you seemed as happy as ever.

When you got stressed on MSN I offered to do something to help and you just said no you&#39;re going to bed. I tried to find out what&#39;s wrong but you just tell me you need to sleep. No matter what I tried you were just hostile and adamant that you didn&#39;t want to stay on.

So I&#39;m sat here wondering what the hell is wrong with you. I know that the work is getting on top of you, and I&#39;ve offered to help you do that if I can. But apart from that I have no idea whatsoever. So I tried to think of something that I could do that would cheer you up. I could message you on myspace...But what would I say? I have no idea what&#39;s wrong. I have no idea if what I say could piss you off even more. It&#39;s like walking a minefield in the dark. I have no idea whatsoever what is pissing you off. Not only does that mean I don&#39;t know how to sort it out, but it also means that I don&#39;t know how not to make things worse.

But wait! I&#39;m seeing you the next day! So I decided perhaps the best thing to do would be to go and see you tomorrow, sort things out and try and do something nice. Even if it&#39;s just sitting and talking with you. At least then I&#39;d know what&#39;s wrong and how to sort it out. So I decided to go with that idea. I found that the moment my head hit the pillow, I was wide awake. So spent until around 6am this morning thinking of what I could do that would reaaally cheer you up. I was so worried, but I was trying the think of the nicest thing that I could do that would leave you smiling for the rest of the day.

Then I got a text at 7.15am telling me not to bother coming to see you &#39;cause you&#39;d rather do your work. I figured perhaps you need to do your work and need your space to do that. Maybe you&#39;ll feel better then... But I thought I&#39;d make sure. I texted you to see if you were sure you didn&#39;t want me to go in, and asked what was wrong. No reply.

I ask if it was something I&#39;d done; after all you sounded rather upset with me. No reply.

So, in addition to the night, I spent the rest of the morning worrying about you. I still was completely in the dark and had no idea what is wrong with you. Then I text you again, asking you to say something, ANYthing so I know what&#39;s wrong. Again. Not a word from you.

Then I text you to tell you that I&#39;d stayed awake all night worring about you, and the same goes for this morning. That I&#39;m really worried about you and I want you to just tell me what&#39;s wrong.

You text me to tell me how I&#39;m a fucking liar. Apparently I didn&#39;t stay up all night...because, of course, you were sat right there watching me not sleep all night. You tell me that you&#39;re pissed off because I didn&#39;t say anything to cheer you up. Oh, I&#39; see...because I didn&#39;t send a few words over the internet, you&#39;re pissed off with me. Of course, when I tell you that I wanted to cheer you up in person, because I thought that would be nicer and I really had no idea what to say last night, that means nothing. Of course, I never REALLY intended to do that. I was just sleeping like a baby, then when I realised you were upset I made up this whole story. I wouldn&#39;t REALLY sit up all night worrying because, after all, I don&#39;t fucking care about you, do I?

Don&#39;t ever tell me what I didn&#39;t do. You weren&#39;t there. You have no idea. I actually do wish I hadn&#39;t stayed up all night worrying because obviously it means nothing to you. Obviously a few words over the internet mean so much more than actually seeing me in person. Yeah. Thanks for that.

You leave me completely in the dark and then expect me to know exactly what to say. Before you&#39;ve always given me at least some hint about what was wrong. As far as I knew, you were just stressed about your work. I messaged you on your journal to tell you to keep smiling and that I love you. I had no fucking idea what else to say. You&#39;re pissed off with all the work piling on top of you and, as far as I can see, no matter how much I talk to you that pile won&#39;t go down. I decide that seeing you might help you relax and, who knows, I might be able to help you with some of the work. I was actually considering asking you for some of it and I&#39;d do it for you, to try take it all off your shoulders.

And if you&#39;re getting angry because I&#39;m assuming that the work was the problem, don&#39;t you dare. As far as I knew, that was what was getting you down. I talked to you on myspace, I tried talking to you on msn, I tried to see you today to sort things out with you. You&#39;re the one that wouldn&#39;t let me. You&#39;re getting pissed at me because I didn&#39;t say anything? Then talk to me. You&#39;re pissed off because I&#39;m &quot;pinning this all on you&quot;? Well that&#39;s because it&#39;s your fault. Honestly, what did you expect me to say? You give me a few hours to say something to you that will magically make you better, yet you don&#39;t tell me what&#39;s wrong. I STILL don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong. You still haven&#39;t told me.

And yeah, you do cheer me up whenever I&#39;m down, that&#39;s because I talk to you and tell you what&#39;s wrong. If I don&#39;t tell you, you ask me again. I did that. But you just refused to tell me. You expect me to kick the ball and somehow score a goal without telling me where the goalposts are. Yeah, that&#39;s fair. I feel bad that I can&#39;t help you, I really do. But I need to know at least a hint of what&#39;s wrong before I can help you. It&#39;s not fair for you to expect me to help you when I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong.

How many doctors do you know that treat patient without first knowing the problem. Sure, they may try a few drugs and see if it works. But often the patient might&nbsp; have an adverse reaction. Doctors ask questions and find out the problem then treat it. The mind is infinitely more complicated. If something is wrong with you, I can only help you if you tell me what&#39;s wrong. God forbid I say something that makes you feel worse. I just...don&#39;t understand how you can expect me to help under those circumstances.

You help me because I let you in. You know that. No matter how much I disagree with what I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s bothering me. Even if that means you&#39;re disappointed in me for it. If you completely shut me out, there is no way I can say something to help you out. I help you time and time and time again with whatever is upsetting you, regardless of my own troubles I have always put you first. I have supported you no matter who it was that was upsetting you. You were getting stressed at being stuck in your house so I&#39;ve been trying my hardest to get my driving test sorted so I can take you somewhere you can relax. But apparently I don&#39;t care. Apparently because of this one instance, everything I feel for you has just disappeared. I would not stay awake for hours and hours trying to think of some way to make you feel better if I didn&#39;t care. I would not do everything I&#39;ve done if I didn&#39;t care. I just wanted to find a way to make today as great as possible to make you feel better. But you wouldn&#39;t let me.

I did try to help. I tried the best I can. If you&#39;d have let me, today would probably have turned out much greater than it did and you&#39;d be feeling so much better right now. But you&#39;re the one that wouldn&#39;t let me. It&#39;s not me. You told me I couldn&#39;t see you then ignored me for 6 hours. How can you honestly blame me? Just because I wanted to do something nice for you, rather than send a few words over the internet, you tell me I don&#39;t care about you.

I <b>love</b> you. Don&#39;t you <i>EVER</i> tell me otherwise."

"event","I've never really considered myself a bad child. I never really kicked off at my parents or any of my family, I've never caused hassle, I always did as I was told, I stayed out of everyone's way and just tried to be a good kid. That's the way I see it, at least. All my life I've tried to be nice and have taken everything with a pinch of salt. But right now, I just feel like I'm not part of the family any more.

When my Great Uncle came to stay because he'd been released from hospital and no one else would have him, I figured that my mum was playing the good samaritan and she was helping him when no one else would. But two months later, he's still here. He's still here and night after night he sleeps on the sofa downstairs when he has a perfectly good house of his own. Selfishly, it annoys me that I can no longer sit downstairs on my own at night, making midnight snacks and drinks and just enjoying havig the entirety of the downstairs of the house to myself. But even that I coped with. Then the odd weekend that I'd be at my grandparents', he'd stay in my room. That didn't bother me too much either, because I felt I was doing my part.

But now I feel differently. Every weekend I feel like I'm expected to go somewhere else to make way for him to stay in my room. It might not necessarily be that way, but that is how it feels. Week after week he stays in my room and little by little whatever personal feel this room of mine had leaves me.

Now that I've moved rooms, I figured it would be a nice new start. I thought things would change...but I don't think they will, now. Especially when my mum comes into my room to tell me ""I'll buy you a new mattress..."" not because I think it's uncomfortable. Not because she's being nice. Her reasoning being:

""...because Ralph thinks that one's uncomfortable.""

I just know that next weekend he's going to be back in my room while I'm gone. It's not his house. He doesn't live here. Why is there this obligation to make sure that he's in the most comfortable place possible? Sure, it would be mean to leave him on the sofa. But maybe that would make him realise that he's not supposed to be here. I don't mean that in a nasty way but...he can't live here forever. I can't go on sacrificing a part of myself - because in the end that's what my room is - just so that he is comfortable.

When I moved back from Newcastle, I found it really hard to adjust to having the small room again. Then when my Uncle came to stay I found it even harder, being forced to stay in my room all day. If I wanted I could go downstairs...but that gives me a choice between the living room, with Ralph watching what he wants to watch on our TV, or the kitchen where there is a 90% chance there will be someone smoking. And in either case, both rooms are pretty full. So I end up sat in my room all day, all alone. 

I've never really asked anything of my family. I never ask for too much. I know my mum works her ass off to make sure we have everything we want and, though I'd never tell her to her face, I love her for that. But since I was old enough to realise, I've tried to take the strain off of her as much as I can. I've kept out of her way, not asked anything much of her and helped out where she'd let me. So why is it that of me and my two sisters I'm the one that ends up with no home? No one else seems to mind the whoel situation, but that's because at the end of the day, they have their own rooms to retreat to. I don't. As much as I try to deny it, I can't help but see that I no longer have any privacy. I am pushed aside into a room that I'm forced to offer up to another person every weekend...and I hate it. I hate not having my own space any more. I hate not having a place to relax in. Constantly, I feel like I'm just another guest in this house. I don't feel like I'm wanted here any more.

I'm not saying that I'm not wanted here...I'm just floating around somewhere in between. I feel like my great uncle. That I'm only staying here while there's no one else here. Like I take it in turns with him to live in this room. I half live here and I half live at my grandparents'. I can't go on like this any more. It's been like this for over 2 months to the extent that...It actually doesn't feel like my room any more.

I've just been shut in my room and left there. It came to the point that my room was my only sanctuary. That I could stand. But now, it's like they're taking that one last piece of solitude away from me. Like I'm not allowed a private space of my own.

I just...don't think it's fair."

"event","On <b><a href=""http://pointfourtwo.livejournal.com/8814.html"">&quot;the weekend&quot;</a></b> I was stood, waiting for her to rush through the gates to say goodbye; waiting for her to show me that I was wrong, to cast my bad feelings aside and restore my faith in what I thought we had. But I never got it. I guess, at the end of the day, Roxy was never what I thought she was; and somehow that makes what happened easier to deal with.

Today, waiting for the bus after seeing Callie, I admit I wasn&#39;t feeling excellent, but I was nowhere near as bad as I was that weekend. But today, I realised she cares more for me than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">she </span>ever did. Callie wasn&#39;t willing to leave even some small stupid black cloud that was only there because of my own overthinking hanging between us; she hadn&#39;t ignored me for an entire weekend, she hadn&#39;t left me out in the dark - but still, she didn&#39;t want to leave me feeling at all bad, no matter how small it was. And I guess I realised today that we really do have something special; something that I never want to lose. Without even realising it, she&#39;s becoming exactly what I&#39;ve always wanted. She tells me that I saved her; but I don&#39;t think she realises just how much she&#39;s saved me.

I was just sat there, thinking over things and not getting any better &#39;cause, when I think, the pessimistic side usually wins. I realised that I was being irrational, but at the same time I had to concede that my paranoia made a good case. The things I was thinking had good reason to make me sad; I hate to entertain the idea of losing her in any way, and the addition of a time limit just felt like she was expecting either us to break up by then or... I dunno. Just how it kinda felt that the idea of her dying didn&#39;t bother her at all; despite the fact that it would leave me without her. It felt like she didn&#39;t realise how losing her in anyway is going to make me feel. But I realise she didn&#39;t mean it, and I shouldn&#39;t think about things so deeply sometimes. She didn&#39;t mean any of that and I know it&#39;s not at all what she intended. But as I was thinking, I guess somewhere in there I was just getting myself down ready for the hope that I could look up and see her, and somehow she would make everything okay. Because that&#39;s what I think marks a good relationship...when you can depend on each other to fix things and make the world seem okay again.

I guess, deep inside, I was just wishing that I would see her there and instantaneously all I would see is her, I was wishing that I would look up and she&#39;d be coming to pick me back up, I was wishing that for once, somebody would save me from myself...that for once somebody would save <span style=""font-style: italic;"">me</span>...

This time my wish came true."

"event","I clicked the &quot;update journal&quot; button, having loads to say. Sure enough the page loads up and my mind goes blank.

Oh, I do hate it when that happens. Anyway; let&#39;s see...

<lj-cut text=""The Theory...cut for length"">I&#39;m listening to The Fray. I&#39;m quite liking them.. &quot;How To Save A Life&quot; is oddly...cheering me up. I dunno; it&#39;s a song that I&#39;d normally class as a sad one and thus one that would make me feel sad, but right now it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s sort of filling me with...hope. Like a hope for the future...sort of. It kind of just makes me feel like no matter how bad things seem, it&#39;s all going to turn out alright...because it just has to. The world is often cruel, but it operates with some cosmic karma; and I think that when all is said and done, when you&#39;ve paid all your dues, it will finally leave you alone. I think that in life bad things are bound to happen; both because of you AND to you. But I think in the end, if you work through it and you don&#39;t back down... If you just stand your ground and stick through all of this, if you keep your head held high; then that is something that the proverbial cosmic karma will ultimately respect and...in the end...things will be alright.

I don&#39;t think that there is some all powerful higher being orchestrating everything, and I don&#39;t think that everything is predestined. But I do think that things happen for a reason; but rather than being the will of some deity, it&#39;s we that are orchestrating our path - we just aren&#39;t aware of it. I think that there is a mind / body distinction because I feel that consciousness is too complex and...just special to be explained away through electrical impulses and I don&#39;t feel that it wholly fits with evolution. If we take the determinist view that everything that is going to happen will happen and we can&#39;t change that...then why do we have the ability to believe that we can? It just seems rather redundant, and nature, to me, doesn&#39;t seem to create redundancies often; especially something so large as human consciousness. But I think that perhaps wherever our consciousness existed before, it decided what to do. I think the mind, or soul, in it&#39;s natural form could quite possibly know everything. I think if you exist outside of time and space, then it is entirely possible for you to know exactly what certain decisions would lead to, and where your actions would take you. That said, the soul could plan a course through life; to some end. On decending and entering the body, the soul could lose some of it&#39;s faculties, and indeed a lot of it&#39;s knowledge. I think that is why sometimes we may get feelings that something is just &quot;right&quot; y&#39;know? You have no basis for believing it, but you just know that something is right, and you have to do it. I think that&#39;s because you&#39;re suddenly remembering part of the path that you&#39;ve already chosen. You&#39;re vaguely remembering the route you&#39;re supposed to take; you don&#39;t know why you&#39;re supposed to, just that you are. I think when you feel that you need to step back and really take a look at what things might lead to. And I think that you need to follow your heart and do what the feeling is telling you to do; &#39;cause, if I&#39;m right, then it&#39;s part of the path that you are here to walk.

The theory also explains deja vu in that, if you get it, it&#39;s because you had already anticipated this earlier when you mapped out your path. I think that the brief flash of deja vu serves as an indicator that shows you you&#39;re on the right path. Likewise, I think that through some dreams, we remember bits and pieces of our path and we remember where we&#39;re going. I think it&#39;s entirely possible that people have dreams that later happen in life for one of two reasons, if nothing else: One, the dream is simply the amalgamation of a series of possible and probable occurences that you have considered and that later have happened. I don&#39;t see this as some mystical psychic ability; rather the use of probability to determine the most probable outcome, which, in this case, is the one that occured. Two, I think that maybe in your sleep state, your mind is more removed from the body that in your wakeful state. That said, the soul or mind is closer to it&#39;s natural state here, and without the body tainting it, it realises a little more of the knowledge it once had and thus remembers parts of the path it has chosen.

I think, like much of theology, that the body tarnishes and taints the soul. I think in it&#39;s natural state, the soul is absolute, perfect and all-knowing. When it interacts with the body, it loses a lot of what it once was. Take a pianist (LOL OMFG PENIS!!!111!!1!!!). Actually, I&#39;ll format this to make it easier to reeeaaad.

Pianist = The Mind.
Piano = The Body
Music = Actions

Take a world class pianist. He (yes, &quot;He&quot; ...Fuck PC.) is a master with music - any piece that you could conceive of, he can create. He can create masterpieces so, so easily in his head. The only thing limiting him is the tools at his disposal. Say you take the pianist and put him in a room with a piano which has three quarters of the keys missing. The pianist here will create a piece of music to the best of his ability...but because of the tools he is using, the piece he creates is limited and thus not as extravagant as one might expect. However, as you increase the keys on the piano, the pieces he creates become much more elaborate, complex, and beautiful.

Some people theorise that the soul is a preposterous idea because it doesn&#39;t fit with evolution. If animals don&#39;t have souls (though I believe they do, to some extent) then where did it come from? At what point on the evolutionary chain did we gain our soul? I think that the soul has always been there, interacting with us to some extent. As we were (if you&#39;ll excuse the phrase) a lesser life form, the soul could only interact with the body to the extent that the tools at it&#39;s disposal - the piano/the brain - would allow it. As we evolve, the body and brain get more sophisticated - the piano gets grander and gains more keys - and the soul can interact more. I think the dormant areas of the brain are just parts that the soul is unable to interact with yet; but as we evolve, new doors open and the soul gains more control.

Also, as a side note; it is not the piano strings that make the keys move and thus the music happen. It is the pianist that presses the keys and makes the piano strings spring to life and then create the music. Likewise, it is not the electrical impulses in our brain that &#39;cause us to do things and to think that this is some conscious effort on our part, it is the soul interacting with the brain and then the brain affecting the body.</lj-cut>

...Of course, I could be completely wrong. I&#39;m not sure I believe it entirely, myself, yet.

That said, I&#39;m going to make my ACTUAL entry in a new post, &#39;cause this one is rather lengthy.

I also have the urge to download a Backstreet Boys album... or maybe N Sync...or maybe both?"

"event","I refuse to grow old here. I think right now the only thing that&#39;s scaring me is that if I get a job here I&#39;ll feel as if I&#39;m settling down. Honestly, the thought of settling down anywhere scares me. I hate to feel tied down to anything, I like freedom. I just don&#39;t want to spend the rest of my life here because...well, that&#39;s not the way I see my life going. I guess I&#39;m just overthinking things a little, now though.

When I look around at the buildings, the streets the people, even my house; none of this feels like home. It all just feels like a place that I&#39;m waiting in, biding my time, until I&#39;m ready to go. However, at the same time it all feels...warm. Like on a cold morning when you wake up and you KNOW that you want to be out of bed and living your life...but it&#39;s so cold. And right now, wrapped in your duvet, you&#39;re just so warm and comfortable that you&#39;d rather just stay there. I feel like that. I feel like I&#39;m still laying in bed, surrounded by that safe, comfortable warmth; and it&#39;s...cosy. I like it. But I know that what I really want is to be out there; living my life and finding that path that I want to follow. I just need to kick my ass into gear and get myself going and decide what to do next.

Newcastle is almost completely a part of my past, now. There&#39;s one guy that&#39;s wanting to move into my old room; so I&#39;ve just sent the contract off to sort that out for him. Now I need to wait for them to sort out that and then the Accomodation Office can find and move somebody else into my room and I&#39;ll stop having to pay for that. And once all my flatmates find a new person for their house I&#39;ll be out of that too. I just hope they sort that out soon because it&#39;s not gonna turn out all that well if I end up having to pay rent for a house that I&#39;m not living in. Though I think my mum has sorted out some way out of that with a friend of hers.

Callie hasn&#39;t been very happy and it scares me that I don&#39;t know how to help her. I want to make her happy, more than anything but...I really am at a loss for what to do. I guess, perhaps, in the case of me not knowing what I can do; the only thing left to do is wait until she needs me or asks for my help...apart from that, I&#39;m stuck.

In happier news, yesterday was one of the greatest days, that I can think of, that I&#39;ve had in a long time. Callie and I went to York for the day and it was just...perfect. When we first started talking, I felt like there was some connection between us, and thankfully it only seems to be getting stronger. We walked around for a bit and sat in a pub and made a toast to us... I know she doesn&#39;t like me saying it, but I really think she is perfect. I can&#39;t really think back to when I&#39;ve been in a relationship and not had anything that I didn&#39;t like. Usually it be the case that there was some small thing, probably completely insignificant, that annoyed me a little, but I&#39;d just accept it because of my feelings for the person. With Callie I genuinely like everything about her, and everything about us. I can honestly say that when I look at her, I don&#39;t see a single flaw. I don&#39;t see anything bad at all. I&#39;ve never been with someone and had things just feel so...perfect. When I&#39;m with her, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s just me and her. There&#39;s just no separation there...it&#39;s just <i>us</i>. When we&#39;re together, I do feel as if we are actually <i>together</i> like nothing in the world could possibly tear us apart because there are no two entities to separate. We are one. It all just feels so perfect and I love that feeling.

And now I&#39;m going to get a shower. Then I&#39;m going to have some (more) food and maybe write some more. The story has completely changed to what I intended originally and, for the most part, I&#39;ve forgotten what my original (and the new one, for that matter) idea was. Ah well, we&#39;ll see how it goes. I&#39;ll also draw Callie a picture today or tomorrow...I&#39;m stuck for ideas, as of yet, though. We&#39;ll see."

"event","I am in an oddly good mood. And so I have no idea what to write, right now.<br /><br />I want to write a story but I don't know what about. I want to write something that people will read and something that is going to interest me to the extent that I'm not going to just abandon it after a chapter or two. It sucks that my last one got lost on my shitty EHD 'cause I was really liking that one. Ah well...I have a few ideas I could try...I really do like writing.<br /><br />I'm finding the Battle Royale OST oddly uplifting. Well, the last song, at least. And the Lost OST is very relaxing, if not scary at times. And it's often rather sad how I can picture what was happening when a particular piece was played...Some might say that I watch Lost too much, I say that I don't watch it enough! I love Lost...Maybe I'll watch them all again... That said, new episode tonight! Woo!<br /><br />*conducts for a short while*<br /><br />Ron told me that if I keep progressing the way I am, he can start booking me into matches by March, which will be pretty damn awesome. I had a mini match with Callum last session which was pretty awesome. Could have been better; but it was pretty good nonetheless. I don't, however, like the Edinburgh Street Centre. The mats keep sliding around and I always manage to get hurt, somehow. The Lonsdale mats don't move at all, which I find rather snazzy. That, and the last time I was there, I came home and didn't ache AT ALL. Well...Granted, I got the flu after that, but that wasn't wrestling's fault. It was my mum coughing on me. Curse her! *shakes fist* I still got to see Callie though...so it's all good.<br /><br />Hahaha, I only just realised that the reason my screen was dark was 'cause I'd turned it down last night. Silly me.<br /><br />I don't really have much else to say. Well I do but I'm a lazy git and shall summarise it all in a sentence per topic.<br /><br />- Whatever comedian said that, if anything, fat people should be made to park FARTHER from the supermarket rather than being given disabled stickers, was right.<br /><br />- My cat looks content; and somehow that relaxes me.<br /><br />- The Prestige is a great film; I've seen it twice in as many days.<br /><br />- I'd say more than a sentence about Callie but...I really can't capture what I want to say about her in words; she is such a great girlfriend, no matter what she thinks.<br /><br />- I can't wait for York &lt;3<br /><br />- Ending posts with quotes is the sex.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />""Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking.

"event","Wooooo wrestling training FINALLY.

Wait. Let's back track, shall we?

Last monday, I got thinking. I know, me thinking never ends well. Well, I was thinking about my course, and about Uni in general. I decided that Uni just isn't right for me... I mean, my entire plan had been to go to Uni, meanwhile do some wrestling training, and then get my degree and go and wrestle. So, that said, Uni was just a distraction...something to do and enjoy while I tried to make it in wrestling. But the problem was, I just wasn't enjoying it. I figured that I didn't want to do something that I wasn't enjoying, for three years... Especially when doing that was going to mean holding off wrestling; holding off my dream. I didn't want to put it off for three years when most guys started around the age I am now...

So, I decided that I'll leave. I've just got to tell the University I'm leaving, now, and sort out what happens to the loans I've had off them. Silly me, eh?

Anyway, I went to training today for the first time in like 4 months. Granted, I didn't learn much new regarding wrestling moves...But I learned a nice new spot that I want to use some time, and we did promos...which were very fun. Ron said that should I continue to attend the rest of the training sessions, he can start putting me in shows...

Of course, the downside of doing promos is that I'm still in all out Scott Adams mode...Now I just wanna spit a promo at everyone. ^_^

Uhhh...I think that's all I have to say. I have training tomorrow. We'll do matches =D

Maybe I'll post another entry tomorrow... I have so much to rant about... God that's gonna be fun."

"event","Honestly, does that really sound like some PMS reference?

I guess it does, actually. Ah well.

I feel the need to rant. Despite me having to get up early(ish). But what could I rant about? What could I possibly have right now that&#39;s pissing me off? Hey! Let&#39;s rant at people without naming them! Guess who?

Hahaha, so ghey.



Hmmm, who first?

Oh, you! Honestly...right now, I feel no hard feelings against you. I mean, going off with another guy; perhaps it was my fault; maybe I did something to drive you away. I just don&#39;t know. But hey, you cheated on me and went off with somebody else. That I can live with. Shit happens. What I HATE is that you lied to me. You told me you loved me when you and I both knew FULL WELL that you didn&#39;t. You &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; see me on the same weekend that you met the other guy and...well...I don&#39;t know. I just never expected this of you. This was the last thing I would ever have expected. But hey, it&#39;s all good, right? No hard feelings? Besides, you&#39;re gone from MSN; I don&#39;t expect you to be bothering me any more. Can&#39;t see you sticking around on MySpace much longer either...So, what the heck, I guess this is my goodbye to you, should you ever happen to read it. You hurt me. A lot. Thank you for that. You also lied to and cheated on me. Thanks for that too. But please. Next time you do this to somebody (&#39;cause hey, looking at how you act, you&#39;re bound to do it again - hey maybe I should warn J-Dawg (as I like to call him) about you...) have the courtesy to be honest. And not to pin the whole decline of the relationship on them when you just couldn&#39;t control yourself. Oh. And purely sexual relationships are shit. What was the point, towards the end? &quot;Went too fast / way too soon / I feel disgusted and you should too / It&#39;s no good when all that&#39;s left is the sex / The sex / Sex has become all I know about you, memories of those filthy things that we do.&quot; Ha...so true. But yes, thanks for the good times and thanks for showing me the real you before I was in too deep. Really. Thank You. I promise never to mention you again.

Nowwww on to you. Haha, oh, where to start. I mean...You really have some fucking nerve! You read my journal...then complain about things I said? Why. Seriously, if I wrote that shit, it was because you were making me FEEL that way. If you want to be angry at anybody, be angry at you! But, I reckon out of the people I&#39;m referring to here, you&#39;re most likely to read it. And you already know who I mean. Anyway...uhh...yes! So yeah. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not angry. Actually, when I heard you&#39;d read this and this was why you were so angry...I laughed. Seriously...its just silly. And kind of pathetic, really. I don&#39;t intend to be insulting but I find it childish. Being angry at a person because of the way you make them feel? Ah well. Honestly, I hold no grudge against you any more. I consider us.. Equal now, I guess. I couldn&#39;t care if no one ever mentioned your name again. It&#39;s just the way the world works. Everyone changes and moves apart. I don&#39;t want any more to do with you. I don&#39;t mean this to sound bad, and it&#39;s very hard to. I&#39;m aware I&#39;m failing. But hey, I wish you the best with...whatever you do and...yeah. Bye.

And you. I loved you. I really did. But then you sorta just..flipped. You went crazy...You just weren&#39;t the same girl I fell in love with. And honestly, comparing Homosexuality to the Nazis? What were you thinking? I didn&#39;t appreciate you judging me all the time. I hated that. You did it so often. And shouting at me for the most minute things... Making me feel bad for nothing... Being angry when I didn&#39;t agree with you... Pushing me away... Roxy did that one night too. It reminded me of you. It made me hate her so much in that small moment. But to continue - Pulling friends away from me, making me out to be the bad guy in everything (so much for &quot;can we stay friends?&quot;, constantly trying to control my life, even after we broke up... All these things, I hated and I still hate about you. You just...you were so adamant that you were always right. Being a Christian, I guess I can understand that you don&#39;t like your beliefs mocked. I mean nobody does; but Christian values are particularly strong. But also, for a Christian, you were the most judgemental person I know. I really didn&#39;t like that. I want to think that I could get over this... But I can&#39;t. You&#39;re almost everything I hate. I&#39;m quite stuck to find what I liked about you in the first place... Well no, that&#39;s not true. The first four months or so were excellent...They really were. I enjoyed every moment of it...but then it just went downhill. Everything just changed. And you changed a lot. I don&#39;t know, maybe I did too. But that happens. And there was no need for everything that happened after the relationship had finished. That I can never forgive you for. But I guess the friends that stuck around were the true ones. I can honestly say that you really hurt me. It was a big blow. Of course...you seem insignificant compared to what Roxy did but hey...that&#39;s life. Oh, Roxy is 17, not 15, or whatever you said. Hehe, silly bitch.

And finally you. Honestly...we have ups and downs and some times I don&#39;t mind you. But bitching about my friends is something you ought not to do when I am there. Especially bitching about good friends and my best friend. Yes, the &quot;good friend&quot; refers to one person, and the bitching about my best friend I guess wasn&#39;t so bad...Actually. No. It was. And I&#39;m not going to forget it. Nonetheless, I&#39;m not going to tell them what you said. There&#39;s no need and it will make no one feel any better. Oh, and talking about me behind my back...well...making fun of me behind my back is not going to make me happy either. That pissed me off. And it all happened in one day. But hey, it was a nice learning experience. Honestly...I like you at times, and other times I despise you. Of course that changes from person to person. And you have your exceptions.. But still pissing me off is pretty hard...and it lasts with me... Seriously, don&#39;t do it again.



That&#39;s all I can think of so far. But for everyone... Please don&#39;t piss me off. If you make me hate you...I&#39;m going to want to get back at you. And when I do that... There really isn&#39;t an awful lot that I won&#39;t do. I will end up doing something I&#39;ll regret. Not like, kill you. Hell I probably won&#39;t harm you at all physically. But I&#39;m good at getting into people&#39;s heads. I&#39;m good at finding out what I need to know. And I&#39;m good at using things against you. So don&#39;t. make. me do it.

That pretty much concludes tonight...

First of all, to...

But...this is, however my journal. And these ARE my very own thoughts and feelings...

And anybody that wishes to view this journal and read what is within it should bear in mind that this is exactly how I feel, I'm not gonna change that for anybody and I quite honestly could not give a shit what you think.

You see, to complain about anything I write...would be to say that you are telling me what I should and shouldn't think. Now do you think that is really fair? Anything I think, I must have some good reasoning behind that. After all, I'm not particularly irrational. I would never liken gay people to Hitler, criticise someone for their beliefs, nor relentlessly make somebody feel smothered for two years. And when I say that I won't tell anybody things that you've said...I'm not going to then tell the people you've been talking about. Because to do that would be to go against what I believe in. That is, not being a two faced bitch that hates not getting her own way. Sorry, I mean ""his"" own way.

And thus...I make no apology for what I've said because...If I've said it...then I mean it. And if I mean it...then I probably don't care if that upsets you.

I writing stuff here.<br /><br />I have to be up at about 10, preferably earlier, tomorrow for my Hapkido grading. I know the stuff, but I'm still pretty nervous about it all.<br /><br />I talked to Rob today for the first time in two months... It was pretty out of the blue, but it was nice to talk to him again. We talked about getting Renegade back together again when the weather is warmer.<br /><br />Kayleigh, Jake and I all put down our deposits on the house we're gonna live in. Now we just need to wait for Charlotte to do hers. I feel too mature. Am I ready for this?<br /><br />I just met some random person on MSN...neither of us seem to recall ever speaking to each other.<br /><br />I'm a little happier today...but things are still bothering me.<br /><br />Roxy has been going out a lot, which is making me feel worse about her not seeing me on the weekend. The Friday before she was meant to see me, she went out to a club. The same goes for this Friday...yet she didn't see me. I don't think this is her fault, and I don't want her to stay in all the time...but it just kinda feels like she's going out all the time then when I'm there she suddenly can't. It's like the other night; she was on the phone to Kris, and in a conversation with me on MSN. She wasn't really saying much at all. When Kris had finally gone, she said ""Ok he's gone now,"" and started talking a little more which kinda sounded to me like ""okay, I've finished talking to my Ex. <u>Now</u> I'll talk to you."" I just felt like I'd been pushed into second place for a while, behind her ex-boyfriend who she constantly reminds me she hates. I didn't like that feeling at all.<br /><br />We really aren't talking much. When I look at the conversations, we really hardly ever say anything worthwhile.. We just seem to not be able to communicate like we once did. We seem more like friends than anything else. Or just aquaintances. I don't know what that says about the relationship but I can guess that I won't like it. I really do wish we could talk more but... I don't know.<br /><br />Today, we were talking and she mentioned about taking her brush out. I asked why she takes it out, etc. one, because I was genuinely curious, two, because it was my way of subtly saying she always looks fine, and three, because I wanted to keep the conversation flowing... However, she later picked at me for it, saying that I was questioning her about little things...It reminded me of Cat, and I really didn't like that. Same thing goes for when I tried complimenting her after she was saying she looks bad. She seemed to think that I was just trying to argue with her. That was exactly the same as what happened when I was with Cat and so I really didn't want to go down that path again.<br /><br />I haven't said ""I Love You"" to Roxy for a long time... Two things here. I originally wrote that as ""I haven't told Roxy I love her..."" but changed it. Why? Because it didn't sound right. Does it necessarily follow that that means I don't love her? Secondly, the fact that I am reluctant to say I love you to her...does that mean that I don't? I see Love as something that is indubitable... If I'm hesitating, then I'm doubing it. If I'm doubting it...then it would follow that I don't love her, right? I'm confused about all of these. All the feelings are still there that I had before. But something has changed. She seems like a different person; yet she says that I've changed. I don't know what's going on. I don't like it though.<br /><br />The more we talk, the more we seem to drift apart. We seem to become more and more opposite from each other by the day. We used to be so similar and so close. Yet now, we just seem distant and different... It feels odd and wrong. I have so many feelings now, pulling me so many different ways...I feel torn. I don't know which way to go.<br /><br /><br />Hmmm..."

The way we talk, what we say. It&#39;s like the link we once had is just gone. We just seem so standoffish with each other. Everything feels so awkward.

Last Sunday, as I stood, waiting for my train. I was constantly watching the gate, wanting Roxy to come running through. To say goodbye. To stop this weekend being such a pile of crap and maybe putting everything back together and how it should be...

"event","1. My group in Philosophy suck. They can&#39;t keep a coherent conversation for more than 5 minutes without drifting on to some nonsensical crap. Jake is obviously excluded as he does tons of work. But I&#39;m a lazy git and only do work when it is absolutely necessary, but the others are even worse than me. And they never know what they&#39;re talking about.

2. Recently, I have been finding myself able to talk to people less and less. In person it&#39;s all fine. But any other way, I just find myself having nothing to say to anyone. It especially annoys me when I can&#39;t talk to Roxy.

3. Last weekend. I know it wasn&#39;t Roxy&#39;s fault but it really annoyed me, nonetheless. I don&#39;t think it should have. On the Saturday, she was all ready to go out, but then her mum told her she couldn&#39;t. That I guess I can understand. But then on the Saturday night and for ages on the Sunday I was trying to get in touch with her to meet her then. The only reason I was in Hull was to see her. I didn&#39;t get to see her on the Saturday which annoyed me a little, but then she just didn&#39;t bother trying to get in touch with me and left no means for me to contact her to meet her on the Sunday. I mean, I&#39;d travelled for 2 and a half hours and spent &pound;30 just to see her. I&#39;d expect her to at least try...but she just fell asleep. Honestly, it&#39;s left me feeling crappy, and that&#39;s kinda affecting the relationship. I&#39;m holding it against her, but I&#39;m not sure if I should. On one hand, the Saturday she really couldn&#39;t help; but then had she done the college work like she was supposed to, then it wouldn&#39;t have happened...there&#39;s also another thing about that I don&#39;t get. The Sunday though, I just can&#39;t justify to myself. I mean, after I put all the effort in to get down to Hull for her, could she not even put in the effort to get up to see me? Or even just talk to me the night before and make some plans...

4. The other thing I didn&#39;t understand was this; her mum told her she couldn&#39;t go out because she&#39;d had a letter home about not doing her college work. Fair enough. I can empathise with her view, there. But Roxy said that when her mum asked where she was going, she just said &quot;out.&quot; I haven&#39;t asked her so I&#39;m not entirely sure whether I&#39;m right; and if I&#39;m not then I aplogise; but this is just how things are making me feel. I don&#39;t understand why she didn&#39;t contest it more. I mean surely her mum would be understanding of the fact that I&#39;ve come down from Newcastle just to see her daughter. But I don&#39;t think Roxy even mentioned that I&#39;d travelled all that way and spent money, etc. I don&#39;t think her mum knows I&#39;m even with her... I&#39;m never allowed to go to her house, she seems kind of strange about it when I ask, and...I don&#39;t know...it&#39;s just a thing that&#39;s bothering me. Maybe I&#39;m wrong.

5. Pok&eacute;mon. I&#39;ve played it from the start like twelve times now and it keeps fucking crashing and not reloading the save files. It&#39;s pissing me off so much.

6. I don&#39;t understand why I can&#39;t talk to Roxy any more. We used to talk so much. I think there&#39;s just some negative feeling there, what with the whole weekend thing, on my part and I&#39;m finding it hard to get over it. I want to talk to her about it, but I don&#39;t think I can. I don&#39;t know what to say to her... I need to I guess, or it&#39;s just gonna stay there, but I can&#39;t do it. Sigh.

7. I haven&#39;t told Roxy I love her in a while... It doesn&#39;t feel right when I say it. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t love her; I do. My feelings haven&#39;t changed. But for some reason, saying it doesn&#39;t sound right. Sometimes, I also feel like she&#39;s saying it just because I did. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not true but... I still have that feeling there. She told me she&#39;s not sure about love etc, which I&#39;m fine with...but I don&#39;t want her to say it, if she doesn&#39;t mean it. At least that way I know where I stand.

8. I sometimes feel like Roxy holds it against me that I live in Newcastle. I don&#39;t want her to and she says she doesn&#39;t, but it feels that way sometimes.

When I got to the station, the self-service ticket things were not working, and so I had to join the huge queue to get my ticket. Then when I found my train, it was full. And I mean Full. People were pressed up against the windows, small children were packed on the roof...okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a little...but it was really full. So, I waited for the next train. For the most part, I guess the train from Newcastle to Hull went as well as could be expected. However, when I was in York, then things went bad. I rushed out, and saw that there was a train to Scarborough - a train that I have got before and that stops off in Hull. The train was leaving in a few minutes so I had to make a quick decision. A: Get on this train that probably goes to Hull. or B: Wait around for 45 minutes for one that definitely went to Hull.<br /><br />Well, no time like the present right? I went for option A.<br /><br />I shoulda gone with B.<br /><br />The train was indeed headed to Scarborough, with the only two stops being at Malton and Seamer. I realised as soon as the train was leaving that I was on the wrong one. However, I decided it wasn't such a big deal as I could just catch a train to Hull from Scarborough. So I settled down and waited.<br /><br />Malton passed by...<br /><br />As we approached Seamer, our second stop, the oh-so-informative train informed me that there were connecting trains to Hull. Great! I could just go to Hull from here, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />As the train pulled away, I walked over to the Seamer information board, to check for the next train. Half an hour? Great. It was cold and miserable, but hey, I've had worse. Half an hour is fi-...nope, that's Monday to Thursday. Friday...no train for...hmm...2 hours and 20 mintes. Yay me and my decision making.<br /><br />To cut a very long and uneventful story short, I spent almost 2 and a half hours stood out in the freezing cold, learning japanese to keep myself sane. I finally got to my grandparents' house five hours after I had set off, cold, tired, and hungry. I should never be trusted with travelling.<br /><br />I did, however, see Roxy that weekend...that made up for it all. In the end, it was worth it.<br /><br />The worst thing about the Seamer situation though, was just the feeling that I had there. I was trapped in the middle of nowhere. I had no contact with the outside world and was just stuck, alone, in the freezing cold. I felt so lost; so helpless. I felt like I was in limbo or some similar place. I was some place forgotten, some place pushed aside and forgotten by the rest of the world. I've never felt so lonely as I did then. All I had was the hope that I'd get through this and the rest of the weekend would be alright. I guess it did. But I'm telling you, I felt every single one of those seconds that I was stood on that platform.<br /><br />I hate trains."

"event","Ewww. I feel stupid for feeling down for absolutely no reason, really. Well, there is a reason...but it shouldn&#39;t get to me so much. Hmph.


<u><b>For Scuah...</b></u>

I promised Scuah that I would dedicate a section to her and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I don&#39;t mean that in the kind of way that I don&#39;t want to do it; if anything it&#39;s long overdue.

Scuah has always been there for me when I need somebody to rant at, when I need some advice on something, a shoulder to cry on or just to see a friendly face. Scuah has always been there and has the odd tendency to always know when something is wrong. For all of that, I am eternally grateful to her. I really don&#39;t know what to say... There is so much that I could say, I&#39;m just not sure how to say it...

Scuah is one of those special people in life that always cheer you up, no matter how bad you&#39;re feeling. She&#39;s one of those friends that everyone needs, and one of the nicest and greatest people it has ever been my pleasure to know.

She&#39;s also one of the three people I&#39;d trust with my life, and who I&#39;ve promised myself I will always be truthful, faithful and whatnot to...

I miss Scuah.


<u><b>Roxyyy</b></u>

I just can&#39;t stop thinking about her. I start liking people but then realise that the reason I like them is because they remind me of her. Everyone I see, I compare to her. I don&#39;t know why but she just won&#39;t leave my head. The smallest things get me thinking about her, and once I start, I can&#39;t stop. I hate that I&#39;m so far away from her and I hate that I had to end things to be where I am now. I wish things were different. I really do. It&#39;s been over a month now, and I&#39;m still not over her. She really did and still does mean everything to me. If I think that there is the slightest thing wrong, nothing else seems to matter to me; I just want to help her. Maybe I feel guilty for the way I ended things with her and am seeking some kind of forgiveness. But I don&#39;t think that is it. I just...don&#39;t know. I&#39;d do anything just to see her again; to hold her; to tell her how I feel.


<u><b>I miss...</b></u>

The late night conversations. The walks in the rain. The long goodbyes and the way she held me tight. The way she kissed me. The tiny habits she had. How she always walked on the left and the way she held my hand. The way we could just talk for hours. The way she got shy when I looked her in the eye. The flutterbys. How happy she made me. The way I just had to remind myself that she was my girlfriend and suddenly everything seemed so much brighter. Her voice. Her eyes. The way she waved at me when we were meeting up. Watching kids programs with her. Waiting for her in the rain. Her taste in music and films. Her smile and her laugh. How I felt content, just because she was near me. The way she always looked at the brighter side of life. The way she made me feel.

I miss her so much. I miss how in love we were...

I don&#39;t know if that love ever really left me.



I sent her a letter and picture, etc. yesterday. I didn&#39;t mention any of this, but part of me wants to. I don&#39;t know why, I just do. Songs, films, TV...everything contains some small thing within it that reminds me of her. I just wish I could still be with her. She was one of the greatest things that ever happened to me... And I feel like I threw it all away; threw all that happiness away without trying to hold on to it, and I hurt her in the process.

"event","<font size=""1"">Rawr! I&#39;m bored. And I&#39;m not in &#39;til 2pm tomorrow at Uni. So I need something to do before I go to bed... So, ladies and gentlemen welcome to the sensational and amazing...


<u><b>Aitou no Shoseki.</b></u>

Okay, so I decided that not all that many people are going to read this, so there&#39;s not really any harm at all in putting it on here. Well, here we go...

I regret losing touch with a lot of my friends. I know I complain a lot to people and blame most of it on...a certain ex of mine. But I suppose at the heart of it, I could have changed things. I mean, I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t mind what she did. For someone to tell my friends that they&#39;re not allowed to talk to me, that&#39;s pretty low. And, really, for them to listen to her is even worse.

Come to think of it...If they&#39;re gonna be like that, I don&#39;t really care that I lost touch with them.

Fuck &#39;em.

But, I do regret that since Uni a few of my...newer friends, I&#39;ve not spoken to as much. Especially Roxy; I&#39;ve hardly spoken to her really...I&#39;m gonna draw and send her the picture I promised her this weekend; hopefully tomorrow.. But that&#39;s unlikely. I will send it off this weekend though, I&#39;m promising myself that. Maybe I&#39;ll write a letter too...

Anyway, I do wish I&#39;d made more effort to stay in touch...But I&#39;m just so busy up here with other things, I don&#39;t really have time. I shall start making more time to do so, though.



<u><b>Roxy.</b></u>

Well, what do you know? Another little talk about her... I really do miss her. I haven&#39;t spoken to her in weeks, and...I dunno. Perhaps that&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking about her so much; I just want to know that she is alright. I worry about her too much...

I&#39;m gonna send all the random stuff that I promised her, this weekend. I might write her a letter too. I&#39;ve never written anyone a letter before... I&#39;m also going to include a picture of the Jazz Man... Everyone should have one.

I&#39;m not gonna go on too much here... I could talk for hours... To end with some lyrics from The Duke:

<i>&quot;I miss the way it used to be, when everything was beautiful and you were there and I was sure.&quot;</i>



<u><b>The Stalker</b></u>

Y&#39;know, I went to Doncaster this weekend expecting a nice escape; somewhere to relax. Sure enough, Kev and I are walking along and I see Jason coming up. But...oh, wait, what&#39;s this? Who is this...Who is walking with him? It&#39;s HER.

Wrestling is MY domain. It is my love and passion. Yet she has to be there on this weekend; a weekend that meant more than most to me; and she had to be there to taint it a little bit. Sure enough, she runs over to me yelling &quot;YOU&quot; in her manly voice and hitting me, telling me how she still has her birthday present for me and that I have to go and get it from her room after the show.

Well, I went back to the Camponile with Dave and Lawson and, seeing as she wasn&#39;t there and my granddad had already been waiting for an hour, I promptly left.

But, her being there wasn&#39;t too big a deal, I guess. Besides, nobody could have ruined that weekend. Not her. Not Mark. Nobody.



<u><b>Scott Adams who?</b></u>

I miss wrestling training. I&#39;ve started up Hapkido and it is awesome. For the most part it is a lot like wrestling; but it seems a little...empty, without selling the moves. I love selling moves. And I miss being able to forget who I was for three hours and just become a whole other person.

That said, the kicks in Hapkido were fun, as was playing with the sticks. And the joint holds and stuff were fun and gave me a lot of ideas for spots...But I have no way to use them before I forget them. I&#39;ll have to ask around somewhere to see if there are any wrestling schools near me. I really hope there are.

I miss wrestling.



<u><b>Straight Edge.</b></u>

I feel I should write something about not drinking at some point. I don&#39;t think I have before; and if I did it obviously wasn&#39;t enough as I&#39;ve forgotten it. I have to start by saying that I hate it when people say that I don&#39;t drink because I am straight edge. That is totally the wrong way around. I don&#39;t drink because I don&#39;t want to; I just don&#39;t enjoy it. I don&#39;t do drugs because, well, it&#39;s just not something I&#39;d ever want to do. And I don&#39;t sleep around because I don&#39;t like doing that. Those three things, combined, make me straight edge.

Secondly, I don&#39;t hold any feelings against people that do those things. I&#39;m quite happy to hang around with people that are drinking; they have just as much of a right to drink as I do not to. I respect their lifestyle and I just hope that people respect mine.

Also, the fact that I don&#39;t drink does not mean that I do not want to go out on a night. Though, clubs are something that I really don&#39;t enjoy that much. I like being somewhere that isn&#39;t pumping music out at a volume that renders me deaf; I like talking to new people, just not in an atmosphere where I have to shout a lot and only hear half of what the person said. Either way, I need to get out more and meet new people. Though, Hapkido seems to be a good thing for that anyway. They&#39;re also having a social night thing next week too...I&#39;ll have to go along to that.

But, pretty much the following sums me up:

I don&#39;t drink, do drugs or sleep around, because I don&#39;t want to. That&#39;s it.
If you drink, do drugs, sleep around or all of the above, I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s up to you and I&#39;m more than happy to get to know you.
I don&#39;t particularly like being around a load of people that are so drunk they are throwing up and doing stupid shit, but sometimes that happens.
Being straight edge doesn&#39;t make me better than you. Likewise, not drinking doesn&#39;t somehow make me weird and lesser than you.
Straight Edge has nothing to do with eating meat, in my eyes.



<u><b>Rich Recommends:</b></u>

That&#39;s right, it&#39;s that special time of the day again where we all learn from the expertise of yours truly...

...Right. So, yeah. Today, I decided to take a look at the world of television. Okay, that&#39;s kind of a lie. Since arriving here, I really haven&#39;t watched much TV at all...but I&#39;ll try my best.

<i><u>Lost</u></i> &nbsp; --- I love Lost so much. Because Kayleigh hasn&#39;t actually ever seen any Lost, and because I have all the Lost I could possibly have at this point in time, we&#39;re watching it through in its entirety. We&#39;re currently ploughing our way through Season 1 and the whole thing still grips me. Our Lost nights are becoming a nice little thingto look forward to at the end of the day. And dammit, Sawyer&#39;s quips still leave me in awe. I wish I could think up stuff like that right away...

<i><u>Firefly</u></i> &nbsp; --- I&#39;m gonna have to watch it again. For a Sci-Fi show, there really isn&#39;t that much Sci-Fi in it. It is a nice mix of humour, drama and action; with little bits of Sci-Fi in between. It is set in space, but that&#39;s about as Sci-Fi as it gets. The folks on Serenity are just an honest bunch trying to earn a dishonest buck. I think the show captures the evolution of society and language quite uniquely and accurately too. It&#39;s quite possibly a likely way that humankind could be headed. As a side note, I also got my mum to name her beauty shop after Serenity ;D

<i><u>QI</u></i> &nbsp; --- The nerd in me loves QI with a passion. As does the rest of me. This show teaches me so much, and I always have fun doing it. But once you notice the odd shape of Stephen Fry&#39;s nose, you never see anything else...

Is it odd that I seem to start most entries with that?

I'm too lazy to make this entry friends only; if you don't like what I put in it, I don't care.

I'm also to lazy to put this into nice paragraphs. It'll pretty much just be a collection of thoughts as I think of them...

I dyed my hair blue a couple of weeks ago. I like it.

I never thought it possible, but WWE has actually made me bored of seeing hot women on TV. Week after week they shove the ""Diva Search"" down our throats (maybe there's a pun in there somewhere...). Each time I see it, it gets exponentially worse - I use that word because Lewis Black was taught it in a math class once... In recent years (again to steal and modify a line of Lewis Black's), I have come to realise that WWE is to Wrestling, as KFC is to Chicken. Wrestling seems to have become a marketable product, nothing but something to make money from. The passion that used to be there seems to have gone. I think TNA is going the same way, too.

I actually started this entry like a week ago. But shh, don't tell; nobody will notice.

I hate it when people tell me things that I already know...over and over again. Especially when said person has a stupid name that nobody can pronounce.

I got my results on thursday. I got Bs and Cs mostly. I didn't actually get the grades I needed for University (I don't think...) but it seems I still have some of that luck left, as - seeing as they got the results before me - they had confirmed my offer the day before. I'm looking forward to it, but the prospect of seeing Roxy only once a week is <s>not</s> an appealing one...That said, nothing's gonna stop me doing this. I have a feeling I need to :/ I'm hopefully gonna take up Hapkido when I'm there, and all manner of other activities. I would ideally like to continue wrestling training up there, but I don't know where I can do it. Regarding results, though many of the modules, I didn't do so well in, in my Moral Philosophy I got 98/100, one of the General Studies exams I got 120/120, and I also got full marks in my Psychology Coursework.

Only God knows how I did it.

Roxy came with me to get my results. I think it was the first time either of us had been out before midday in months... Anyway, the highlights of the day included Miss I'mGonnaStalkYouForTheRestOfYourLife staring out the <s>conversation</s> corner of her eye at us (she also asked how my results were - the first words she's said since the Heather thing - as she walked by), walking proudly past Cat as we went to get my results and...well, the results themselves, I guess.

As of the above entry, I won't be deleting mistakes I make, regarding me typing the wrong word in place of another, I'll just be using strikeout then putting in the word I intended in the first place just so you can see how often I actually do it. Though, now I've said that, I'll probably start doing really well with my typing.

Cat signed in to MSN today for the first time in ages. By ""signed in"" I mean ""unblocked me"". I don't know why, and to be honest, I don't really care. Apparently she's already told Nicky everything I'd said about her when we were together - me and Cat, not me and Nicky *shudder* ...*shudder at the thought of Cat too* - and apparently told her not to speak to me 'cause she's Cat's friend, not mine, and she also said the same to Rob, I think. Now, by all means, she can have Nicky, but telling Rob not to talk to me is just stupid, considering I was friends with them way before she could stand being around them anyway. That, and she is so two-faced! She tells me we should stay friends, then starts acting like a complete psycho bitch because I didn't give her the answers she wanted. She gets pissed off 'cause I didn't spend months mourning us breaking up. She gets pissed off that I went to see one of the only friends that I have fun with. And she tries telling the rest of my friends not to talk to me and to stay away from me. She bitched about <b>everybody</b> while we were together and was adamant that she hated Nicky. Yet, we break up and suddenly she's best friends with her. But, that's all in the past. I wouldn't even mind if she tried talking to me, any more. But if she tries starting up any shit now, then fuck it, I don't care if I upset her any more - it serves her right for being a total bitch. When I told someone that I'd been talking about her, he said he'd not ask for any further details so he didn't get caught in between it all. From that, I'm presuming that she's been saying stuff about me too. I wonder if I should try find out what...

This weekend, I went to 1PW. We planned it all as we always do, but then the day before we went, one guy pulled out and <s>this</s> messed up the plans. Normally, we have three pairs, two pair room, thus splitting the cost between each pair. However, with him pulling out, we <s>then</s> now had me alone in a room. Thankfully, well all put together and made up the extra money. By the end of the night, it turned out that we'd be thankful for that extra room. During one of the matches, Kreese, who works with the security, got injured and had to go down to the hospital. When he got back to his hotel, they'd locked up and everything, so he came down to the Camponile and we switched around the rooms a little to accomodate him. I like the Camponile. <s>They're</s> Their beds are comfortable.

Anyway, enough <s>bock</s> about that. On to the show! The show was great. I had an empty seat next to me, and thus lots of room to relax in. Well, the most interesting part of the night, and thus the part I'll skip to, naturally involved Sterling James Keenan. The guy who presents 1PW TV (I dont' know his name) came out to award somebody an award (well, duh.) Anyway, out comes Dan Edge, who has...something wrong with his legs. He basically needs walking sticks to walk and couldn't quite walk normally. Dan had apparently been doing a lot of charity work, and thus would receive an award for it all. Anyway, he gets into the ring and SJK's music hits. SJK appears with Team Supreme. I didn't actually realise this til later, but he came out with Team Supreme pushing him in a wheelchair. SJK gets in the ring and starts cutting a promo. I can't really remember any of the promo, save for one line. This line was quite possibly the one of the best lines I've ever heard in a wrestling promo. Sterling looks Dan right in the eye as he stands their with his walking sticks and says,

""Normally in a situation like this I'd break your legs...but I see God already beat me to it.""

I swear, my sides almost split. Now, a lot of people might say, and a lot did, that Keenan went too far with that line. However, I found out later that the entire segment was Dan Edge's idea. Due to SJK's popularity, the team had no idea how to get the crowd to hate him. Of course, when someone attacks a disabled guy, everyone hates him. Dan Edge suggesteed this was the way to do it. Anyway, who the hell cares? In my opinion, SJK delivered that line with perfection, and it certainly fit the moment. Sterling was out there to make the crowd hate him. His JOB is to make the crowd hate him. The moment he starts thinking, ""naw...I can't do that, people might complain"" is the moment he fails at what he does. Wrestling is about getting the reaction that you need from the crowd, and last night, that is exactly what Sterling did. Another reason I like that he did it is the fact that he had the balls to even say it. Sure, it could upset a few people, but like I say, it is Sterling's job to go out there and make them hate him.

I don't like being overly Politically Correct. Sure, some things just shouldn't be said, but sometimes people just go a little crazy with watching what they say. Censorship is another hate of mine. I think that sometimes kids are living their lives a little too sheltered and that later in life, that sheltering is gonna 'cause some problems. I believe that sometimes, censorship is the product of parents not taking good enough care of their children. I think that when wrestling (I apologise for making it about this topic - but it's what I know most about) is heavily censored and cut back on TV because some little kid tried doing a move on another child and injured them, then it is plain stupid. Had the parents taken better care of the kid, and watched what the kid was doing, then the accident would have been averted. I think this should be extended to backyard wrestling too. I'm not really saying it shouldn't be done; I'm saying it shouldn't be done in a blatant, non-safe way. Wrestling on mats is different from wrestling on the grass. But either way, if your kid is wrestling in your backyard and he falls and breaks his neck; wrestling isn't to blame. The wrestlers aren't to blame. You are to blame for letting your kid do it. If you think wrestling is the reason it happened, then maybe you shouldn't have let them watch it.

I forgot what I was gonna talk about some time ago, so I'll stop now. It's 05:13 and I'm tired. Maybe my next entry will be more organised.

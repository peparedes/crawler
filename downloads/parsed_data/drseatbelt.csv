"event","I will be printing small numbers of shirts with the designs posted on this page over the next week and a half. If you want one, IM (drseatbelt),email (lancasterh@ncssm.edu) or post on this thread with the design name and shirt size by this weekend... they should all cost about $4.
______
Shirt and print colors are based on what's readily available, so don't base your purchase on color alone. However, you can expect a reasonable degree of color scheme coordination (sorry, no brown on pink).

Some <strong>possible</strong> Color Schemes: 
<strong>Flava-flav</strong>:         silver/gold/yellow ink on black tee
	     or Black ink on white tee
<strong>Film Junkie</strong>:      black/lt. blue/green ink on white tee
<strong>Nerf</strong>:     Classic purple ink on yellow tee
	    or Green ink on white tee
<strong>Del</strong>:      black/lt. blue/green ink on white tee"

"event","Completely to be ingored by the whole of the internet's users, except for those who know me, this Livejournal will exist as an extention of my curious late evening impulses to showcase my 'work'. Soon to be posted will be a better looking, CSS enhanced site, along with fewer words from myself, and more content. If, in the future, I do realize that I now have a blog, and upon that realization,  I decide to further embarass myself and post funny quotes, comics, photography, etc. you will be the first to know. thank you faithful reader (b/c i  know YOU are the only one), and stay tuned.

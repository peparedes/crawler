"event","Right now I feel like complete shit. I was just talking to my friend Josh about me wanting to change and whatnot. He is a social butterfly who can meet and talk to people as if he were cutting soft butter. I, on the other hand, have the trouble with that. I like to consider myself a social butterfly, but it depends greatly on my surroundings.

Anyway, I want to change but it's really hard for me. One thing I really want to change is my weight. I will openly admit that I am 260 lbs and I'm only 5ft 4in-ish. I'm not sure what the ideal weight is off hand for that, but it definately is <i>not</i> 260 lbs. I've tried several diets and the only ones that have worked are the ones during my surgeries, when I couldn't eat anything except pudding, jello, ice cream, and drink fluids.

I've never had a guy look at me the way Zach does and I want to know what it feels like. I love Zach with all my heart, don't get me wrong. It's just that I hate being 'the fat girl' and I don't know what else to do. I'm afraid of using diet pills because I don't know if I have that addictive personality thing going on; being 260 and wanting to be 150ish is a huge difference and I'm afraid I would take it to far.

My ramblings will stop here. If I keep going, my homework will never get done and I will only become more and more depressed. Here is where I say 'Au revior' to no one in particular."

"event","I am so frustrated right now. I talked to Zach while I was on my break from my math class. I just wanted to let him know that I was going to call when I got done. He said that he had a mandatory meeting for his hall. He didn't even say ""OK, bye"" when I said told him I'd call him later. Therefore, I just hung up. Oh well. I got back to my room and called Zach again. He said something about watching a show so I asked him if he wanted me to call him back later. He said, ""No, I think I'll just get off the phone."" I was a little pissed off because I really did want to talk to him. He was being an idiot though. He said that we could talk tomarrow night after 8pm. I said fine and hung up. If he calls back, I won't get the call because I'm down in the computer lab. If he calls, I might call him back later.

Other than that, things are okay I guess. I'm getting along with my new roomie Vanessa. Yes, I have moved to another room. I couldn't take Ericka not talking to me if I was living in the same room. When she found out I was moving out, she started talking to me. Whatever, I don't mind it. She and I talk now and it's cool I guess. Anywho, Vanessa and I are in a 4 person room but it's just us two. It's fun! The other roomie, Sara, moved out for several reasons. That's okay, I wasn't sure if I could handle living with her. Vanessa couldn't and I can see why. :P Anywho...

I guess that's it for now. I like my classes so far. My computer class is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Ok, shutting up now.

School: I received my report card last week. I got three A's and one B. I'm pretty happy with the results. The only class I got the B in was my Intro to Business class. Classes for the Winter Term start January 9th. I'm excited.

Family: I'm going to see my grandparents today on my dad's side. YAY! I haven't seen my Gram since September and my Gramp since the summer. My dad and I might so do something too. Maybe I can ask him if we'll go see the new Cheaper by the Dozen 2 movie...? Mom is ok. Garrett is still himself. No present-giving for Christmas this year. We have no money to buy presents.

Boyfriend: Zach is planning on coming up here the day after Christmas. We have finally stopped our arguing since we know why and what we were arguing about. Mainly, his mom. What else is new, huh? hehe.

Other: I'm not sure what else to put in here. Still looking for a job. I desperately need one now. Especially with that internship coming up. OH YEAH! I forgot to tell yall about that. I got an internship with Disney over my Spring Quarter and the summer. I'm pretty excited about that. Another thing, Melony emailed me. I'm pretty happy about that. I asked her if she wanted to go for coffee or something over break.

That's it for now! Talk to you all later!

"event","Here's the brand spankin' new lowdown on good 'ol me. Things have improved ever so slightly for me today. I won't start with that first however. I'm going to start with things that have made my life a living hell in recent days.

As you all know, I have 2 roommates at the moment. One is named Ericka while the other is a fiery red head named Becky (aka: Pumpkin). Well, lately miss Ericka hadn't been talking to me. If she dare say one word to me it was always in a nasty tone. She couldn't even look at me; again, if she had to or did, for some unknown reason, it was always a dirty look. I was getting sick of this uncalled for silent treatment. Therefore, I told Becky that I wanted to move out into Vanessa, Sara, and Sam's room. Apparently Ericka got wind of this and was already offering my bed up to Sam and/or Sara if they were deciding to transfer into ""Ericka's room"". I say that it was her room because she is overly verbally abusive towards Becky, she drove Kendra out of the room in a mere 4 weeks, and now she drove me out. There are several reasons as to why I'd like to live with Nessa, but it was mainly because I have no one else to live with and I <I>absolutely had</I> to get out of that room.

To continue on my road of the living hell, I have finals coming up next week. There's only one real final test (Accounting) and final paper (English). However, I also have a test in my Psychology and Intro to Business classes. What is really stressing me out is all my homework and catch up work I have to get done by Tuesday. There are 8 assignments for Intro, 7 or 8 things for Accounting, and then my research paper on top of it all. For those of you who know me well enough, I'm about to crack because <i>I HATE DOING RESEARCH!!!</i> So you can understand my small dilemma.

Thanksgiving break could have been much better too. Zach's family dinner on the Sunday before was fun as usual. His mom was pretty nice and normal while I stayed at the house on Sunday and Monday nights (Zach had classes on Monday and Tuesday). My family Thanksgiving dinner was more bearable than what either Zach or I thought it was going to be. The real shit started hitting the fan on the way up to my house on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. Zach and I had our first real arguements during the time at my house. It wasn't exactly the time we imagined having. Well, to make matters worse for us... his mom suddenly got into this Anti-Krystal stage sometime and apparently she doesn't really like me much right now for some unknown parallel universal reason.

Let's make things brighten up a bit shall we? Even though I have finals next week, I'm almost done with my first quarter of college. I will be done Thursday the 8th and don't go back to school until the 9th of January. I'll be able to spend time with Zach; hang out with Felicia, Josh, and Heaher; and <I>hopefully</I> be able to find my best friend Robin.

Great news: I saw the new Harry Potter movie. It was pretty good for what it was but I truely believe it could have been better. My heart was stolen by Rupert Grint (Ron) and the twins by the names of Oliver and James Phelps (George and Fred).

Now onto the happier thing. I might have a spring/summer internship with Walt Disney Resorts! I'm so excited. I went to a presentation, filled out an application, had an interview and will know in about 2 weeks. My cousin showed up after the presentation but was filled in by the recruiter. She filled out the application for a different type of program for the same thing (long story), had an interview, and was given a job right on the spot! It's so cool! I'm hoping I get into it. It will open so many doors, job opportunities and so much more. I'm excited. Wish me luck! Well, I think that will be all for now. BYE!

"event","<P>Things could be so much better right now for me. I miss my teachers from high school; I miss my real friends; I miss having a real father... oh wait, I never knew what that was.</P>
<P>My father and Lorie are having an intervention against me, with my mom there as a referee basically. They aren't going to pay for my tuition next term or at all unless I get a job. My tuition for next term is a whopping $300! It's actually less than that, but closer to $300 than to $250. I thought I was getting up to $6,000 this year for college but that went down the drain. He's only going to pay what is necessary if I get a job. How do you look at buying books for college? It's part of your education because you can't do the classes without the books, right? Well, my father and Lorie have said that even though my tuition is only going to be $300, they are not going to buy my books although there will be available funs for it. So, overall I'm really angry at them. I'm taking 16 credit hours which is 4 more than the normal requirement for a full time student at Baker. I put in a minimum of 4-6 hours <STRONG><EM>PER NIGHT</EM></STRONG> of homework. I'm also the type of person who stresses <EM>very</EM> easily. I know I couldn't handle working 20 hours a week on top of all my homework. I don't know anymore, I'm just upset about everything.</P>
<P>Zach and I are going through a really rough time right now. It came to the point that I wasn't going to see him or his family over Thanksgiving Break, which isn't cool with either of us. So we talked a little last night and yesterday and decided that he's going to send me money to for gas to come see him. If we didn't see each other we were going to go absolutely crazy... plus we both could use the booty. LOL!!! Anyway...</P>

"event","Hello to everyone. I've finished my 7th week at Baker College and have my classes for next term: MKT 111B (Principles of Marketing), INF 112 (Word Processing, Jan. 9-Feb. 10), INF 121 (Intro to Windows, Feb. 13-Mar. 17), MGT 211 (Management & Supervision), and MTH 101 (Math for Business). There was a petition in my accounting class to get the accounting II added to the winter term. I looks like it might go through. Hopefully, with the Dean's approval I'll be able to take that class also. That would make a total of 20 credit hours (the INF classes are only 2 credit hours each). I just hope that I won't be over doing it. Things are going okay with my roomies I guess. Kendra has officially moved out of the room and it's been a better atmosphere since. YAY!

There are only 6 days seperating me and Zach. I'm so excited to see him. We talk every night when possible. He's doing well and can't wait to see me. Thanksgiving break is going to be wonderful! I get out of school on Thursday because I have no classes on Friday. So, I'll be heading down there on Friday.

Speaking of being done with classes on Thursday... Everyone knows that the next Harry Potter (Goblet of Fire) comes out on Friday as well right? Well, I'm <b><i>EXTREMELY</b></i> excited because I get to see it Thursday night with another person in my dorm hall. Her name is Vanessa and we've become friends, all thanks to Harry Potter. It turns out that she works in a movie theater about 20 minutes away or so. She gets to see the movie the night before with one other person for FREE. Vanessa invited me to go see it with her! <B><I>I'M SO EXCITED!!!</B></I> The only thing I need money for is bottled ice tea or candy, but they're only $1 each. So I'm all good on the Potter front. haha. By the way, do you all like my new HP icon? :P

I'm a little bothered by the fact that Robin has yet to get ahold of me. It's been almost 8 weeks since we've gotten together and I miss her dearly. She's one of my best friends and I hate not being able to talk to her. I've seen Felicia once since school started for either of us, but we try to talk online as much as possible. I plan on seeing Josh this weekend. I think he's coming up here Friday or Saturday. He's going to take me home too. My roomie Becky might come with. I talked to Heather once since I've moved into and started college. That's mainly because my phone got turned off and I don't have a phone card to call anyone.

Other than all that, things are going pretty well for me I believe. Not much else to report on. If I think of anything else, I'll come back and report it! Sorry for the long entry and the delay in postings. Bye!

"event","I'm so stressed right now. I have so much work to do for tomorrow, but I have a strong feeling that I won't get it done for class. I should be doing it at this very moment, but I just don't want to do it.

I didn't go to my PSY class on Monday. I don't even remember my alarm clock going off. I was up so late on Sunday that I didn't mind missing class though. It's a class that I haven't missed, but it happens to be a class that the professor is awesome. That's the only reason why I'd be sad. One of my friends is in that class with me and she said that he wasn't making much sence so that's ok.

Anywho, today was kinda slow. I went to my classes and then back to the room. I couldn't make my Velveta Mac and Cheese last night so I decided to make it today for lunch. It was nummy. Then I put in a movie to do my homework, but I didn't get much done. I ended falling asleep in front of my computer. Now I'm talking to Zach on the phone.

He's doing well. We both can't wait for Thanksgiving break because we'll be able to see each other. I haven't seen him since the middle of September, and I miss him terribly! Well, I think I'm going to get going now. Talk to you all later.


PS- Sorry this is a crappy post. When I have some serious free time I'll leave a more interesting one, hopefully. TaTa For Now!

Love Always, Krystal Lynn"

"event","Today has been an extremely hectic for me.  I had a test in my Psychology class today; not sure if I did well or not, but I'm hoping I did.  After class, I was unusally tired so I went to take a nap and ended up sleeping another six hours!  After that, I had a pod meeting at 5pm.  After that, I went to my 6pm Accounting class.  When that was over, I had to come right back to my room for my room meeting with my three roomies and two RAs (Resident Assistances).  Yeah, interesting.  I'm really stressed out because I can't seem to stay with my simple study schedule.  Instead of updating my journal, I should be looking for my Business current event and/or typing my problem/solution English essay.  So, here's a little bit of halloween fun and have a good day!

"event","I'm sitting in my dorm right now, tired as ever. I couldn't go to sleep until almost 3am this morning. Then, at 6.30 this morning, the fire alarm went off AGAIN! This is the second time it's happened in 4 weeks.  If this is going to become an every other week accurrance, then I'll freaggin' find another place to sleep, ya know?

Last night we had a bitch fest about a bunch of things. A lot of it was about Becky, and her decisions about this weekend. They were similar to last weekend. There wasn't too much to say about me, but things were said. I'm not going into everything, but it was interesting (and not in the good way).

I'm not sure what else to say. So I'll go and leave you all with a few quiz things.

"event","Things could not get any more messed up could they? Sunday night was more drama that I was even close to bargining for. Kendra found out that her ""boyfriend"" had cheated on her the first week of school. Well, of course, there was all this drama and tears and whatnot with that. She was so upset and hurt that she told Jake (the ""boyfriend"") that she didn't want to live anymore; that she was going to pop a few pills.

Wanting to make things interesting, and totally freaking out without thinking, Jake called 911. I called him back to let him know that she wasn't serious, and he was pissed. He was one hold with the lady from 911 when I called him.

Within a 1/2 hour or so, Campus Saftey and a medical person had shown up. It wasn't long after that when a couple of cops had shown up. All these people were escorted to our room by the R.A. that lives in the 700 pod, just down the hall.

Through all of this, I was standing outside because I didn't want to be caught in all the mess. I finally got cold standing out there and came inside; it was around 2.30am when all this was going on. I had class at 10.30 so I wanted to go to sleep A.S.A.P, so I could be rested. Well, the friggin' R.A. wouldn't let me into my room until 3am! I was not a happy camper.

I was in the middle of eatting when all this started, so naturally I finished eating before I attempted to sleep. The time on my clock read 4am before I fell asleep. Ericka and Pumpkin (Becky) took Kendra to Hackley Hospital. I don't know anymore. The only one that is able to talk to Kendra without any worries, really, is Pumpkin. It's messed up.

I told Jake that, with three other girls in the room, Kendra was not going to be able to kill herself. ""The next time something like that happens, call me. You have my number; you know that we're not going to let anything happen to Kendra."" He ended up calling me at 6.30am because Kendra sent him a few text messages that scared him. I kindly talked to her about it, but I still wasn't too happy about it.

Enough words have been said here. I have to go and finish my Position Paper for English (Wicca being misunderstood). By the way, I have chosen a name for my Wiccan/Witchcraft faith: Lavendar DreamMist. Therefore, my full name would be Lavendar DreamMist Rainbolt. I'm happy. Alright, now I'm leaving. Here's a special Buffy the Vampire Slayer quiz. Talk to you all laters!!!

Love always, Krystal Lynn

"event","Why must a girl always have some sort of drama in her life? I don't understand, nor do I want to. It isn't fair to those who don't have it and don't want it. Why must things be difficult for those who surround you as well?

In case you couldn't tell, there is tons of drama when it comes to my college life. I had enough of it in high school, aren't I allowed to at least get through one measley little day of college without it? I'm guessing the answer is no. Bummer for me. I think that I'm the only one who hasn't yet cried today. What am I going to do with these girls?

How was my weekend? I feel it was very sluggish yet very rewarding (in small ways). <I><B><U>THURSDAY,</I></B></U> I went to pep band after seeing one the drum major(ette)s and an old friend, Anna Lisa. It was a Varsity Girls BBall VS Fennville. BIG time rival. Woot, Woot!!! We won by a big margin. I guess their season hasn't been very good so far, so it was not only a good win over our rivals, but a good win for the season. During half time and until I went home, I hung out with Taylor J, Kasie W, and the one and only Bailey! It was lots of laughs to be completely honest. I loved it! So much fun. <I><B><U>FRIDAY,</I></B></U> I slept forever, showered, went to bowling league (did not so great... first game was a measley 83), went home, talked to zach and fell asleep in front of the TV. <I><B><U>SATURDAY,</I></B></U> I worked along with <I><B><U>SUNDAY.</I></B></U>

So there you have it. Life up until now. Other than that, things are going okay I guess. I'm still waiting to hear back from Robin. It's been almost 3 weeks now and I'm getting really worried about her. We have never not talked this long (except for my trip with my dad a couple of years ago). Well, I believe this post is long enough. I'll see you all later! (maybe) :P

Love always, Krystal Lynn"

"event","so, things are quite interesting my way i guess.

my dad and lorie were upset with me for a while because i was letting my mom use my car. i was letting her use it because i didn't necessarily need it right away. which leads me to the point of looking for a job when i get into the whole 'college' grove. it's a long story and i really feel like going into depth. so yeah, let's just say that i was having family issues.

college is going pretty good as far as classes go. here's a quick look at my schedule:
MONDAY ~ psychology 101 @ 10.30am
TUESDAY ~ english 102 @ 10.30am / intro to business 101 @ 12.30pm
WEDNESDAY ~ psychology (again) @ 10.30am / accounting 101 @ 6-9.40pm
THURSDAY ~ (same as tuesday)
and that's it! aren't i some lucky gal? haha. well, so far so good. i really like my psychology teacher. his name is dr. weller and he's friggin' hilarious. my roomies are cool. certain things are starting to irritate one another, but hey, what can you do?

i'm not really sure what else to say. i hope you all like my new layout. I DO! lol. well, i think i'll get going right now. adios to all the readers!

"event","hi everyone. i just thought i'd take some time to let you know what's been going on in my head.

this past weekend has been a little crazy. i was up all night friday so i could pack my things. i moved into my dorm on saturday. i have four roomies: Kendra M., Ericka V., and Rebecca S. They're cool. i had my first class today: PSY 101. my professor's name is Dr. Weller. he's funny. anyway, i got a call from my aunt today about my car. she's upset that i'm letting my mom use it. she bought it for me and not my mom, she says. well, since i don't need it right this minute, i told my mom she could use it until she could get a different one in october. well, things are just not going well in that general area (family).

zach and i are doing okay. we have a small arguement yesterday on the phone. i was depressed and i wanted to talk to him but he was playing a game with tom. it's usual for him to do something while he's on the phone, but normally he'll stop if i really need to talk to him. however, he didn't exactly get the point last night.

i've been thinking a lot about my past, and things that i've done. i've realized that i have driven my friends away. i've known that, but right now i'm regretting it in a way. yeah, most people say that once you go off to college, you won't even be friends with you HS friends. that's not always the case though. like felicia and heather m: we've talked and hung out (heather and i have anyway) and we're still friends. it's friends like adam v, ashleigh r, mary, ashley t, mel, ernie, bailey, etc. that i miss hanging out with. i'm making new friends, granted, but i have that ""it's not the same"" feeling. i've talked to mel only a couple times since our major fight in january/february but it was only short necessary sentences. i called bailey once to see if she knew when the next renaissance fair was and she talked me a tiny bit at graduation. i don't know, i just kinda miss talking to them.

other than that, things are going well. i have 2 classes tomorrow: ENG 102 and MGT 101. (basically, my english and business classes). i think i'll talk to everyone later. bye!"

"event","i'm <I>SOOOOO</I> sorry for not updating in forever, but i haven't had interent at my house. right now i'm at my friend felicia's house and she's talking to her boyfriend, brad, so i'm on her computer updating my journal.

<I><B><U><font size=5>friends.</I></B></U></font> yeah, there isn't much to talk about i guess. robin and josh were dating for a little while but now they're just friends. i guess, i'm not really sure at the moment... it's kinda confusing. i haven't hung out with felicia a lot so there isn't really much to update on. uhm, let's see... robin, josh, felicia, yeah that's about it. oh yeah! i have a new friend (so far) also. her name is Kendra Mc Farland from Hesperia, MI. she's one of my roommates for college. YAY!

<I><B><U><font size=5>college.</I></B></U></font> things aren't going as smoothly as i wish they would. i have to get my W2 form and tax return from 2004 to baker before i figure out what my financial aid is. so i'm a little frustrated. but oh well. let's see, i guess thats about it for the moment. oh yeah, i also need about $1500 by september 23rd for tuition.

<I><B><U><font size=5>boyfriend.</I></B></U></font> zach has been at purdue for about 2 weeks and I HATE IT!!! well, so does he a little because he misses me. but what else is new huh? he's also missing his little brother, cody. mainly, he just misses picking on him. lol.

<I><B><U><font size=5>family.</I></B></U></font> i'm not going to say what i want to say because i'll just dig myself a hole that i can't get out of.

<I><B><U><font size=5>work.</I></B></U></font> i've been working so much but i hardly have a penny to show for it. i don't want to get into details about it, but that's mainly because i'm not sure what the details are. haha. anywho, on the paycheck i'll get on the 8th, i'll only have 1 day off on it. that's pretty good. if i would have gone in today, i would have worked everyday. that's a lot man!!!

i'm not really sure what else to talk about so i'll just leave it here.

<I><B><U><font size=5>SONG OF THIS ENTRY:</B></U> ""Numb"" by Linkin Park</I></font>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"

"event","<P>where do i begin this long journey of progress upon my life? there are many things on my mind and here are the subjects to which i will choose from: family, friends, lover (more commonly known as boyfriend), work, college, miscellaneous. where shall i start? what the heck, let's start in alphabetical order.</P>
<P><B><I><font size=4>boyfriend/lover.</B></I></font> my love for zach at this moment cannot die out. i love him more than life itself right now. right now, zach and i are in a forgive-and-forget stage in our relationship. i've know plenty of relationships where it was the male who has screwed up in one way or another. how many do you know where it was the female? well, here's another to add to your list or one to start your list. yes, it's true that i've made a very big mistake in the perfect relationship that zach and i have going for the both of us. here was my big mistake: i slept in the same bed with another guy. i'm not sure if this guy knows it or not, but i honestly wasn't planning on doing that. when he fell asleep, i was going to slip out of the room and go sleep on the couch. things didn't happen the way that i had planned. in the morning i felt guilty, so as soon as the guy left (just so everyone gets it correct, this guy is a friend... not someone i was looking to get action from or whatever), i called zach to tell him i loved him. right away i noticed that something was wrong and i asked him what it was. he told me that it was the fact that i always hang out with this specific guy friend late at night and alone. here's the reasons why that happens: 1) he works 2nd shift and i usually work the 'night shift' at the ice cream shop; 2) we're usually the only ones awake that we know that late at night; 3) the last time we hung out with more that just me and him... he ended up dating on of my best friends; 4) we don't have any of the same friends anymore. i love zach with all of my heart and he knows it. so does my guy friend. i cried for so long because i realized that i hurt my beloved zachary. he knows that i still feel extremely bad about it but you can't change the past. he has forgiven me and now we're (or at least i'm still on it) on the forgetting part. however, it's hard for me to&nbsp;do that right now. to zachary cale warren: <B><I><U><font size=5>I LOVE YOU WITH ALL OF MY HEART AND SOUL!!!</B></I></U></font></P>
<P><B><I><font size=4>college.</B></I></font> i have orientation tomorrow. i'm really excited. that's why i'm going to make the rest of this post really short. so i can rest up for my overnight orientation trip. *big smile*</P>
<P><B><I><font size=4>family.</B></I></font> right now i'm at my dad's house again. i was here a couple of nights ago (saturday night) to dog-sit. that was because they were up at the cottage they bought fixing it up and doing all those fun things *sarcasm obviously* but now i'm here because my aunt&nbsp;lorie is in the hospital. it's good though, don't worry. it's because she's having her baby! it's kinda funny though because she hasn't even had her baby shower! lol. it's supposed to be next weekend.</P>
<P><B><I><font size=4>friends.</B></I></font> haven't had much time to hang out with anyone lately except my guy friend. he came up with me to my dad's house saturday night. (you can put 2 and 2 together now)</P>
<P><B><I><font size=4>miscellaneous. I'VE GOT MY NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK!!!</B></I></font> it's exciting because normally Rowling could talk about one subject over 3 or 4 chapters, but now it's something new every chapter yet it somehow all flows together. it's awesome! GO HP GEEKS!</P>
<P>here are some lyrics that i've been listening to lately. i'm coming to the realization that i really like and understand Clay Aiken's songs. so, here is a special song dedicated to zach: This Is The Night</P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>When the world wasn't upside down /&nbsp;I could take all the time I had / But I'm not going to wait when a moment can vanish so fast / 'Cuz every kiss is a kiss you can never get back / <STRONG>(Chorus) Lift me up&nbsp;/ in your eyes / If you told me that is what Heaven is, well, you'd be right / I've been waiting forever for this / This is the night </STRONG>/ </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>When the answer to all my dreams / is as close as a touch away / Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say? / <STRONG>Lift me up / in your eyes / If you told me that is what Heaven is, well, you'd be right / Hold me close / to your heart / I would go with you to the ends of the Earth and we'll fly / I've been waiting forever for this / This is the night </STRONG>/ </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>This is the night where we capture forever and our tomorrows begin / After tonight /&nbsp;we will never be lonely again / <STRONG>Lift me up / in your eyes / If you told me that is what Heaven is, well, you'd be right / Hold me close / to your heart / I would go with you to the ends of the Earth and we'll fly / I've been waiting forever for this / This is the night</STRONG></FONT></P>

ok, so i had this whole entry typed out, but my stupid laptop mouse pad area thing went 'back' instead of updating so it all disappeared. so here is a brief overview of what i had typed.

zach + me = greatness. i'm going to get to get him after work on thursday. then i'll be taking him home on the 12th. i'm excited. however, i'm even more excited for our trip in august and then his family invited me to their family reunion. i'm really happy about that. it makes me feel loved.

my uncle was here with his wife and 3 sons. his 2 oldest sons are from his previous marriage and freddy, the youngest, isn't his. it's from pam's previous marriage. anyway, the 2 oldest boys went home last wednesday before i got a chance to hang out with them. my uncle had bad timing with his vacation though. he was in the hospital from a wave runner accident. anywho, he had surgery. he's okay now though.

also, i rode a horse for the first time a couple of weeks ago. it was a lot of fun. i would like to go again. it was slow, yes, but fun. the horse i rode wasn't really a horse. he was a huge ass mule. they gave me the biggest one of the group (there were only 4 plus the leader lady). his name was foolish. it fit him well because every time we passed a branch or bush or something he'd try to eat. i thought it was kinda cute and funny. he was a sweetie though.

well, i've said enough for now. talk to everyone later.

"event","<P>to all of my readers, though there are few, i apologize for my lack of posts. things have been hectic both here and in indiana.</P>
<P>there's no thing like family that loves you. my dad's side of the family came over from minnesota to see my graduation. there was my gramma, grampa, aunt beth, uncle mike, and cousins melia and rohan. my grandparents didn't get here until thursday afternoon while my aunt, uncle and their kids were here on wednesday evening. i spent part of thursday with my aunt, uncle, and cousins before my graduation. that was fun. zach and his mother also came for my graduation, arriving just before my graduation on thursday. thursday night was spent with my entire senior class at an overnight lock-in party. first it was bowling then to craig's cruisers for the lock-in. there were music videos you could make (i made one with felicia and mary: i just can't wait to be king from the lion king), ty dying tshirts, temporary spray on tattoos, games, bumper boats in the middle of the night, miniture golf, go karts at 4am, and a hypnotist. so much fun! anywho, i spent most of friday sleeping (i was confused all day when i woke up at 2pm). zach's mom went home around 10 friday morning while zach and i spent the evening at my dad's to spend time with my grandparents. so much fun!</P>
<P>it's hard to believe that it's over. i think about it every day. i will truely miss the people in my class, people like katie herbert, jenna saarela, joelle marineau, nichole dirkse, and many more. these are the people that gave me inspiration on a daily basis in one way or another. i can't wait for my 10 year reunion now.</P>
<P>saturday i spent the day with zach. good quality alone time with him is exactly what we needed. it had been so long since we had sat down together and had an actual conversation or just cuddled up together. that night we left for his graduation the next day. sunday rolled around and so did zach's gradutaion (his class was about 130 compared to my 62) and a couple of his friends' open houses. here is where i say CONGRADULATION TO ZACH, TOM, JOHN (especially with&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;eagle scout), STEPHEN, ME!, FELICIA, AND SO MANY MORE! anywho, it was a fun day. then i came home monday and began waiting until friday when i'll be driving down to get zach for another crazy weekend of my open house at the bowling ally in douglas and then his on sunday.</P>
<P>i'm not sure that there's much else to update on. work is work. i haven't worked in almost 2 weeks due to all this crazy graduation stuff. i work on thursday then who knows when i work again. well, i'll talk to yall later!</P>

"event","<P>goodness. where to begin my adventures since i last posted.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM><U><FONT color=#ff6666 size=6>family.</FONT></U></EM></STRONG> my dad is really beginning to irritate me. he says that he isn't getting on my back about FAFSA to annoy me, but because he is concerned about my future. that's fine with me except for what my mom told me when i got back from making a trip to walmart for her: my dad is now holding the monthly child support that he told me he'd send to me for college. it would go directly to me instead of to my mom. well, now he's going to keep a hold on that and <EM>see</EM> if i need it. therefore, i'm not in the best state of mind when thinking about him. on to happier things: my dad's side of the family is coming over for my graduation! i'm really excited because i haven't seen them in what seems like ages. they mean so much to me, i just wish i could have had more time with the side of the family that doesn't treat me like a toy. i'm not saying all of my mom's side of the family does, but a majority. darrell: psyco... mike: never really got to know him because he moved out west with his new life; i have 2 cousins i've never met!... marilyn: love her but can strongly dislike her all in one; she's a little woman with too much attitude for her own good; she's tried to tell my mom how to raise garrett, but let's face facts, she hasn't done such a hot job herself with her own son william... lorie: the better one of them all... grandma bounds: i'm not even going there!</P>
<P><STRONG><EM><U><FONT color=#ff6666 size=6>friends and health.</FONT></U></EM></STRONG> felicia is my best friend. as of monday, may 23rd, i got really sick. my tonsils had swollen up. that was nothing new. i went to prime care to have it checked out. they checked for strep throat. results: negative... i was safe. they also checked for mono. results: negative... safe again.&amp;nbsp;however, on tuesday, my tonsils were so big no one could see the back of my throat and i had developed the hives. i &lt;EM&gt;really&lt;/EM&gt; didn't want to go to school on wednesday, but i did due to the fact that i had exams. wednesday i went back to prime care. they put me on some more medication and gave me a shot in my butt. not fun. i felt like crap on thursday, which was really sucky because my senior trip was to depart friday morning. (i swear, this is leading up to felicia). well, by 1am friday, i was feeling like the most miserable person ever. so i had decided not to go. i called my advisor earlier on thursday, but i thought i would try to see if i would be able to make it. turns out i couldn't. friday morning (while my phone was turned off) katie herbert had called me to say something along these lines, ""hey krystal. it's katie. we're on the bus to senior trip wishing you were here. *insert a bunch of kids saying feel better, wish you were here, etc* ok, well, get better. we love ya. (jenna) bye bud!"" it was so sweet! i cried 1) because it was sweet, 2) because i really wanted to go, and 3) because when i woke up around 11am i was feeling so much better that i could have gone! talk about a disappointment.</P>
<P>anywho, by friday night, i was in desperate need of human interaction. so i called felicia and talked to her for a while. it was mostly complaining how i really wanted to go on senior trip and was really sad that i wasn't there, etc. with my sad sob story. she invited me to spend the night so i did. i had such a blast! one of sam's friends, becky, (sam is her oldest sister just sos ya know) was over also. so it was pretty much a party with sam, becky, karen, felicia and me. we played hot&amp;nbsp;brautwurst(sp?) (wink wink felicia... that was funny!) it's like hot potato, but the potato was really hard to use with our knees, so we used a big brautwurst. very funny. so, between the 5 of us we had our own little party. then on saturday i went home for a little while to get my meds and to take care of pepper. i ended up going back to felicia's for shopping. her mom, becky, sam, me, felicia, and punkie (sam's baby, kenneth john) went shopping for a graduation outfit for felicia. well, i asked karen how she looks so cute all the time with confidence because she's like me, not exactly little. the other's hadn't left yet by the time we got to the mall so karen, felicia, and i went to get something to drink and look at some outfits for me. i have a HUGE problem when it comes to feeling cute but being comfortable as well. so karen and felicia played barbie doll until the others got there and then they helped me before looking at outfits for felicia. it was really funny though because in layne bryant (sp?) there was this lady in the dressing room next to me who they were bringing cloths too as well so it was really funny because she played 'dress-up krystal' with karen and felicia! it was humorous. we found a perfect shirt but it was $45 so i didn't get it. karen said that if we found a similar shirt or another one that i liked that was cheaper, she'd buy it for me as a graduation gift. karen wanted to go into old navy because of the new plus clothes so i found a cute but sassy green shirt there that she bought me. right now, it's my graduation shirt. aw, it's so cute lol. then, that night i stayed at felicia's again.</P>
<P>overall, the weekend was spent at felicia's. i'm very grateful for the human interaction that she and her family gave me. they're like a second family to me. yay! lol. thanks much ya guys! to felicia: sorry i complained so much about senior trip too. i was (and still am) really disappointed that i couldn't go.</P>
<P><U><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666 size=6>misc.</FONT></STRONG></EM></U> other than that, there isn't much going on. i've finally started my FAFSA forms. graduation is on thursday, june 2nd @ 7pm at SHS. please come one and all. my graduation party is on June 11th, 2-6pm at Lakeview Lanes in Douglas. it will be like a bowling/kareoke party. come one and all. lol. that's it for now! ttylz</P>

"event","i'm so sick right now it's not funny, yet i was getting laughed at this morning. i called the med-center to see if i could get an appointment in but they said i'd have to wait until wednesday. so they just told us to go to prime care.

just so you know, i have swollen tonsils. . . .again. they did their usual strep-throat testing on me and it came back negative (don't have it). so they said that just because they'd seen it in the area, they were also going to test me for mono. <I>greaaaat.</I> first of all, i hate needles which inturn makes me not like having my blood taken. i'm laying on the bed because my neck and head are pounding by this time and i end up falling asleep. my mom left to make a few calls and when she came back about 1/2 hour later, they still hadn't tested me. mom and i end up sitting there for just over an hour when one of the nurses comes in and says, ""i was just wondering if she tested you because she signed that she did..."" <b><i>OH MY FREAKIN' GOODNESS!!!</i></b> i was so mad... they forgot about me! they had to do a finger poke on me because my veins are not the easiest to find and then we left. they called my mom saying that the results were negative so they were going to proscribe amoxicilian. that stuff never worked before so why would it work now?

to make things even so much better, last night i had some itchy areas on my elbow and i asked mom for the anti-itch cream. she looked at my arms and told me i had hives. again.... <I>greaaaat.</I> so now, i not only have tonsils so big it hurts to drink water, but i also have hives. i want to cry and sleep until it goes away, but i can't. it really sux because these were my last days of school... they should have been fun but they weren't. they sucked royally. <b><i><u>AAAAAND....</b></i></u> i have senior trip on friday. if i'm not better by tomorrow night, i'm so screwed because i might not be able to go. *sadness*

yeah, so i got to school and was talking to a couple of friends when they said, ""you could have scarlet fever."" yeah, so now i'm scared that i could have it and i don't really feel like dealing with this crap. ok, i'm done for now. bye bye.

"event","i'm in utter amazement right now. the realization that this is my graduation is finally hitting me. it just doesn't seem like it's ever going to end. yet only 6 days (3 regular and 3 exam) remain for my high school life. a week from thursday i will be leaving on my three day weekend senior trip to west virginia. this is going to be great. i'm going to be able to hang out with joelle marineau, jenna saarela, allie vanpelt, and mostly people i never really had a chance to get to know well enough for us to hang out. the only time i hung out with them was usually for school: quizbowl, honor society, or band. things like that, so i'm really excited!

i'm really nervous for only 1.5 of my exams. i'm fully scared of my psychology exam and only worried about my story for spanish. it's about this little mouse named concha (short for concepcion) who lives with her father (a king) and her evil stepmom (florencia). well, florencia ends up killing the king and makes concha her slave. one day, concha decideds she would like to go pick beautiful wild flowers. along the way, she meets a bird who doesn't like to eat mice. she's a kind bird and shows her to the most beautiful wild flower meadows that concha had ever seen. the bird leaves b/c she hears her babies crying for food, but forgets to come back to show concha how to get home. she decides that she was going to try and live in the woods because she doesn't want to go home and return to the life of a slave for florencia. concha is hiding in a hole in the ground when a snake enters. the snake doesn't like to eat mice either so allows concha to stay there for the night. in the morning, the snake shows concha to a nearby house for her to stay in. he said he never saw anyone living there so it could be her home. as night falls again, she hears a stampede. she looks out the window to see 7 giant rats, each of a different color, running to the house. they are surprised to see her and she explains her story. they tell her that she can live with them and they will protect her from the evil florencia. the little mouse is grateful and is glad that the rats kill florencia when she comes to find her slave.
<I>in case you couldn't tell, this is somewhat of a parody of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</I>

"event","right now i'm sitting in my third class on my B day: tutorial. as you may know, aaron lechler (aka: ron) is one of our newspaper editors. felicia, melony, ashleigh, and i signed a stop sign as a farewell gift to mrs. willette, one of our favorite teachers. felicia was writing on the sign with a permanent marker when trevor b. printed off a 'contract' allowing the senior girls to draw all over ron's face on our last day, also our exam day. well, he wanted one of us to sign 'senior girls' to make it official and i offered to do it. he ripped the paper out of my hands and said, ""no, not krystal. that's gross."" now, he could have been joking but it still kind of hurt my feelings because bailey laughed. if she didn't laugh i wouldn't have cared because he does that all the time in class. however, the laugh made it sound as if i was disgusting. all i have to say is, at least i'm not as disgusting as she is or was. 

now i'm pissed off again. i signed the sign because i was part of that group. melony, felicia, and ashleigh went to give her the sign and didn't even invite me to do it. ok, so i'm more hurt than pissed off. i would just like to crawl in a hole that used to be called my room and cry. ttylz

"event","i send my deepest apologies to those who have been here, but have yet to see an update. so here it is, my update:

family. things could be so much better. my mom showed me something in my brother's room that deeply disturbed me. in big orange letter behind his door was written ""I WISH I WAS DEAD! I WISH I WAS DEAD!"" and the date above it said ""as of May 4, 2005"" i just looked at my mom and asked, ""am i really that bad of a sister?"" (in case you don't realize why i asked that was because that was my birthday). it scared me so much that i almost fell over. now my aunt marilyn, lorie, gramma, and/or anyone else is getting on my mom's case. they will not let her have a life of her own. she now has to spend every waking hour with him, to be his babysitter because my family is treating her like she can't raise a child. that's not true. i turned out okay. i don't like to blame things on people, but this is a time to do it. the reason why my brother is the way he is, is because of my grandmother. she treats him like he is the most heavenly angel and when he gets home, he is being raised by his mother who treats her children equally. for those of you who know me and my family situation, you understand. here's what i say to my family who is nagging my mother to death: <B>""get your own life and stop trying to control my mom's. stop telling her to do things unless you wish to help with the problem: YOUR OWN MOTHER! (unless you're my dad). i have so much to say to each and every single person, that it's not even funny. i suggest you don't talk to me about it, because i will not snap... I WILL BITE!""</B>

school. i have but a mere 12 days left (including exams) and i couldn't be happier. i leave for senior trip at midnight on thursday (i believe anyway). when i get back i have to march for memorial day. that wednesday (the 1st of june) i have baccalureate at 7pm, then graduation practice the next morning. that night i will have my graduation at 7.30 pm. you are all invited. then on sunday i will be attending zach's graduation. that following saturday (the 11th of june) i will be hosting my open house party at the bowling ally. i'm thoroughly excited. then zach's will be the next day. wow, what a busy schedule so far. anyway, i have to march for band on wednesday for the tulip time parade. even though i'm part dutch, i want to wear a pair of wooden shoes and shove them right up the dutch peoples ass. it just so annoying in my eyes. it's fun if you're not in the parade. other than that, it sucks royally.

college. as you all know, i'm attending Baker College of Muskegon in the fall. orientation is in june or july. i'm not sure what residence hall i'll be staying in yet. i still have to send it in *sad face* but i'm not too worried about it.

graduation stuff. the commencement is on june 2, 2005 at 7pm at my school. i'm excited. my gown makes me look pregnant though. it sucks. i did what my jostens rep told me to do and tried on the other gown but it was too small! so i was a little floored and now mom is thinking of trying to pin it or something so that it doesn't make me look like a pregnant balloon. my open house is from 2-6pm in douglas at the bowling alley. so i'm really excited about that too. june is just going to be a hectic month.

friends. i'm glad to report that i'm not doing to shabby in this department. felicia is my best friend still. we haven't really done a lot as far as hanging out, but i consider ashley troutman and mary brown my friends also. the last time i saw robin was on prom. i'm trying to get a hold of her to see if she would like to hang out again soon, but things have been so hectic that i'm not sure when the next time i'll get to hang out with her is. i've also been hanging out with sarah fitzgerald. she's so much fun! felicia, sarah, and i have several inside jokes: ""brett!"" - ""there's a hole in the car"" - ""dirty... dirty... dirty little girl!"" ah, such fond memories.

work. i'm still working weekends as it stands for charlie. i'm getting 'promoted' this summer and i'm really excited about that. today was my first day working for cheryl. she has a little botique right next to charlie's. i get paid $8/hr so it's great. anyway, i'm also going to look for another job as well this summer. i need as much money as i can get for college before it starts.

zach. i love my boyfriend to death. he is so sweet and supportive, funny and smart, and so much more. to most, he's not a brad pitt supermodel and that's fine with me. he's my prince charming. i'm so proud of myself for making this long distance relationship work. i thought i would have major trust issues with all the things i've been through, but because it's our first bf/gf for both of us, i'm not having that many problems. if we have issues, we talk about them. we let each other know what's going on and i couldn't be happier with him. college is going to be a nightmare, but i'm willing to do the best i can. for his graduation, i want to get him a promise ring. not some dingey one, but a nice one. however, i just don't have the money at the moment. i'll see what will happen this summer.

i guess that's all for now. i'm pretty sure this post is quite long enough. i'll talk to everyone later!

"event","there's a few things i'm talking about in the subject. at this exact moment i'm talking about my feet. i'm sitting in accounting right now but my last class was band. we just marched around town for about 45 minutes because the tulip time parade. well, now my feet hurt like a thousand needles have been poking my feet for hours and now they're swelled up. it hurts so bad.

the next thing i was referring to was school itself. i'm starting to get really annoyed of being here. i'm almost done... i have 12 days left with my exams. here's a how my exams are working out:

monday (23rd): [A3 & A4] teacher's aid & psychology(R)
tuesday (24th): [B1, B2, & B4] journalism, I.S. tech, spanish(R)
wednesday (25th): [A1 & A2] band & accounting(R)
(R)=real exam

--break for test--

MY FREAKIN' FEET HURT! *cries* oh well, just another thing i have to put up with three more times. boo hoo. anywho, i just got done taking an accounting test. it was easy, then again this whole course is easy for me. i get to work tonight. i'm happy, and tomorrow too. i start working this sunday at Cheryl's [right next to Charlie's]. yay! i'll be getting pain $8 an hour there. i'm working from 10-1 so that's $24 when normally at charlie's i'd have to work 4 hours. i'm not complaining though. i'm going to see if any other places are looking for help too. i know that the new movie gallery by my house is hiring so i think i'll go check there. well, i think that's all for now. talk to yall later! hehe.

"event","today is new hope day for me. everywhere i look, i'm looking for new hope for a better environment, for better people, anything to better my well being. it has not been a good morning, but as i've said, i'm looking for new hope to revive my happiness and wash away the sadness that has washed over me this morning.

i'm really starting to hate living at home. as my father once put it, ""you can't hate your family. you will always love them, but that doesn't mean you have to like them."" that is the case currently sitting with me. my brother is out of control. this morning we had another dispute, ending with him saying he wasn't going to school. i had hit him on the side because he tried to take scissors that were in my hand away from me. i told him that he couldn't have them because our mother took them. unless she said he could have them back, i wasn't going to give them to him.

G: ""I'm not going to school.""
K: ""Yes, you are. Now get up.""
G: ""No, I'm not going.""
K: ""You know what? You are not my problem anymore. You obviously don't have any respect for me or mom; the only ones you have respect for are yourself and your precious grandma. You are the reason why I can't wait to get out of this house.""

yes, i realize that was a bit harsh. yet, that is what i have to say to get him to realize that i can't take the irritation he is causing me. some of you would say, ""don't let him walk all over you"" or ""just ignore him"" but it all comes back to this: easier said than done. if you know my brother, you would know exactly what i'm talking about. my mind is mentally exhausted. i've always had enough control over myself to not do something serious to myself, such as cutting. but i'm at my end. i feel as if i'm losing control and soon i'll do something i've always been able to restrain myself from doing. that's not what i want, and if i know you are the person i think you are, depending on who you are, i know that it's not what you want either. that's all for now.

Had a face of stone
And a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, I was so far gone
Cryin' all my tears
With the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl

I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside
Feeling so left out
Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile
And my lighted fuse
Now every time I start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl
Laugh when I feel like it
Cry when i feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
And I've come to know
That the world won't change
Just 'cause I complain
Let the axis twirl
I'm a happy girl

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl

<b>What you see is what you get (don't you know)
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget (don't you know)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

<u>Today I don't feel pretty
And i'm tired of trying to fit right in
Don't think they're just so great
Cause being great must suck</u>

We don't always see the bright side
We all need ego suicide
You hung my id today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So stand up straight and firmly say

What you see is what you get (don't you know)
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget (don't you know)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

<i><u>My heart is in the right place
So wipe that smirk right off your face
Don't make me feel like that
Cause that's just plain not nice</u></i>

We don't always see the bright side

You slapped my face today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on</u></i>

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So set 'em straight and finally say

What you see is what you get (don't you know)
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget (don't you know)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

Santa seemed to miss my chimney
You stole my luck from me
And now my fortune cookie's empty

I used to watch her wear it well
Everything would shine

Someone ran away with her innocence

And I can only imagine what she's feelin' when she's prayin'
Kneelin' at the edge of her bed

Someone to put the light back in her eyes

<b>Friday</b>

I went to school & wore jeans of course. & a tilt shirt 1| black & pink roses & hearts & scribble on it. it was ranin out so my hair got fucked. Then I went in. & In homebase I realize it was Career Day. So i went to my locker & dropped off my stuff. & I ran into Mr.Simms... So he was like go wait by my office I have to talk to you. So I was there for all of homebase and some of 1st block. After he came & I tlake dto him I went to class.

1ST xO P.E. _* I went & sat up with Caty, Phillip, & Gunner & Jonathan. & phillip wouldnt leave me alone. I've had enough of him. EVERYDAY he has to say something to me... something rude & mean. & caty always tells him to stop but he always says ""shes evil she always hits us and shit. you don't know what its like haveing class wiht her all day""... well Did he ever think... that I wouldn't hit him if he didn't talk shit & do stuff to desrve to get hit.  I mean.. whatever. Then TImmy came & sat with us, Then I was inbetwen the 2 seats & then caty fell on me... and gunnar was on topa her.. so I had alotta weight on me. But I didn't care. Then I just left. they didn'tall our class but I still left.

2ND xO Language _* we had a sub. and the first one was pretty cool. but then mrs.roberts was evillllllll. lol. then like 2 ppl tlaked about their job. then I was like fuck it & was ready to leave.

Lunch_* Bean was being gross... & of course Josh wasn't here so I had to suffer with that. Phillip was being a dick.I was ready to go. I ran outta there.

Between _* Iwent to go look 4 my dunkeroos in my locker and they were gone... yeah gone. & phillip & jack & whoever eles like took all the shit outta mine & rae's locker. I picked it all up Whatever. I didn't blow up.

3RD xO Social Studies _* Amalia's mom talked about the war and shit. it was iight. then she left and the rest of the class was just everyone chillin. then I left.

i went straight to class.

4TH xO Math _* we did nothing really. i got to sit by Jack. woo hoo. then whatever. We left at like 3.00. 

Buses_* SO I went upstairs and I was wating to see Connor. Then he came up behind me I was like Whooooa. So I walked with him out.. :) only parta the day where something bad didnt happen: walking outside with Connor & the mexicans. then we walked outside andphillip & jack were being gay... so i kicked phillip in his balls :). 

then I went on my bus. Starnold wasn't there... she wont be here on Monday either... I miss her.

Then I went home...  

We won't even start about what""brittany""did. well. Me & Connor were going to go to the movies... then like 20 mins b4 he was like i g2g I can't go to the movies bye. He left & him & josh went over Nikki's. But b4 that. Nikki asked me to come babysit but I told her that I was going to the movies but if  I ended up not going that i would tell her. well I told her and she didn't say anything back to me...ignoring me?? oh well.

then...i went over chrissy's @ like 11 I tlaked to Connor online. He felt bad for ditching me and wanted to hang out with me today<b> (saturday)</b> and i was like ok what u wanna do. he was like You should come over. I told him to call me after he asked and knew what was going on.

Then I left chirsys's house early<b> (well like 12.30-.12.45)</b> JUST  so I could be home & could go over Connor's house when ever he called or what ever. Then Josh i.med me and he was like... oh you know he went paintballin' right?? I was so pissed.  He tlaks about wanting to hang out blah blah then makes plans with me THEN goes paintballin!?! wtf... oh well.

ANd me and Porno were going to do something today but we couldn't figure it out cuz i had o get off the fone. now i'm sitting at home bored. talking to Jenn<3

So if you wanna do something tonight you can call me if you want....

bye...:-/

song..

<i>I feel it eating at me
While you still drown me
And cross the line over and over again
It's all around me
Now I'm here cause of you

Now I'm falling
I'm falling out cause of you
Now I'm falling
<b>Deeper into you </b>

Tired of hating myself
I can't let me cross the line for her
I'm not me when I dream
There's someone else in me 
That I fear cause of you

Now I'm falling
I'm falling out cause of you
Now I'm falling
Deeper into you 

I'm not me when I dream
I'm not me when I dream, anymore
Because of you"

Woke up late & couldn't decide what to wear.but what ever here's what it was.
<center><b>Blue Aero ""Miami"" t -shit that my sis Katie gave to me for christmas
Other pair of weathervain's (jeans)
Blue high top taylor's</center></b>

then I went to the bus stop & chilled with the people. Talked to Starnold on the bus. walked with David kinda. but whatever. He didn't have any gum. Then I walked with Tony & Phillip. Had to hold Phillip up down the hall -- i'm sure every1 knows WHY -- Then I went to my locker and I was off for homebase.

Homebase _* Sade' was all up in my face again. I sware I didn't do anything to that girl.. Idk whats up with this. Then after wards I was standing by tech ed. and she was like UHHH I wanna kick you fuckin' ass so badly!! and she put her fist in my face and I just stood there and stared at her and didn't move. and she pushed me and I just walked away. I really didn't care. 

1ST xO P.E. _* I got dressed then went out to the gym & was tlkain with the guys. blah blah. Then I went and sat down with everyone. Then we got in groups of 6. 3 boys 3 girls. Me, Caty, Ashley Hood, Phillip, Gunnar, and Jonathan.Then we watched this slide show thinger. I sat with Josh Lew the whole time. & we all know how horny Josh is... But it was cool. then we went outside & everyone chilled & Josh was supposed to go get Tennis rackets but he was sittin on the hill. SO me & Gunnar went to go see wtf he was doing. He got in trouble & had to sit there & wairt. So us three were throwing rocks being dumb. Then we all went inside an changed. Me & Josh were the first ones out. & we were just chillin. Then went to class.

Between _* I was chillin wif peoples and I saw David... But not my other 7th graders... I wonder where they were.... Then I went to class.

Lunch _* Josh tried to Brand me but the sharpie wasn't working but then he gave it to Jack. God damn it. that errks me. It my fuckin' sharpie. Its a long story why I care so much about that sharpie.. and I'm not bout' to sit here and tell it to you. Then The 7th graders passed by our lunch. and Josh was being dumb.. & They can't even wave those little fuckers. I'm just kidding. they know I love them. Then All the guys had to start saying shit again. like always... Gosh I'm so frikin tired of them ALWAYS having to comment on something. I mean UGH. 

3RD xO Social Studies _* Kianna came in late & me and her were tlaking about Sade' cuz she is trying to fight both of us. But whatever. Then I left. Nothing really that grear happened in thsi class so why talk about it??

Between _* I went and chilled by the window. & Terry pulled me & Josh off to the side cuz' Josh was bout to go in class without sittin' and chillin' like we usually do. adn Terry was lik ""ASk her out..!"" and started all this shit about ohh you guys flirt so muhc & I hate it when ppl flirt but they don't do nothing about it. blah blah blah. & Josh was like... No. I just didn't say anything. & I went to class.  But then Terance was like I'm not going to class. So I drug him down there. 

4TH xO Math _* we really had wacky olympics which was iight. me tony & phillip chilled. But Jack and phillip were wiping ""ball sweat"" on me. it was so fucking nasty.!!!!! you have NO idea. Then we were all chillin all relaxed and we were like  ""whoa we are in weird postitions... if you looked at us from above we would make a letter!!"" so for the longest time we were just making letters. it was funny. lol. Then It was time to go. 

Between _* I was walking thr back way to go to my locker & I saw Connor. So I asked him to come wif me to my locker so he did. & he was tlkaing about hot Hott Kathy Is... lmao. Then I went to my locker & walked with Connor downstairs & outside. & we were chillin

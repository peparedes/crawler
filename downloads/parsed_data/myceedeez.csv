But wait! He did! Only it's like, ALL covers and ... well, I don't really know if any of them are even new. All I know is that he covered Richard Marx, Journey, freakin' Daryl Hall, Bryan Adams, and for the love of me, Celine Dion. <i>A Thousand Different Ways,</i> ey? How about <i>A Thousand Different Ways to Screw Your Fans, But Put Out a Record Anyway</i>? 

I love you, Aiken, but you're just too damn good to do covers. You're not on ""American Idol"" anymore. I love your voice, I love your everything, but the cover thing has been played out all year by other people. I'm done with covers. Don't let me be done with you, too.



<font size=1>* = (NOT Claymate ... they're kind of evil, don't you think, each person buying five 
CDs just to get him to number one. I dunno about that. Kind of shady.)</font>



<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Right Here Waiting,"" ""Without You,"" ""Every Time You Go Away,"" ... whatever. I'm pissed! Damn, you know what's missing? A version of Rick Springfield's ""Jessie's Girl,"" but I think I'd be super pissed that he remade that, too. Boo!!!"

"event","<i>The Black Parade</i> has an intro that is a bit reminiscent of another (somewhat similar) band out there, which is Good Charlotte. It disheartens me to think that GC could actually put out an album that doesn't really live up to their standards, but then again, as I listen to the latest from My Chemical Romance, I can't help but be reminded of GC's last album, and I can't help but think that My Chemical Romance put out what I thought <i>The Chronicles of Life and Death</i> should have been. But hey, I'm no music critic. Just a music fan.

The latest from MCR is a thunderous effort --- from their crashing guitar chords to Gerard Way's powerful pipes, you get the modern-day version of those concept albums you might have heard existed at some point in time. To be quite honest, I've never heard a full MCR album, just a couple of songs here and there. But what made me actually buy their latest was the fact that their first single ""Welcome to the Black Parade"" was one of those infectious type tunes that you can't help but know the words to. When Way first begins to sing, I feel like pulling a lighter out and raising it up above my head. It's very weird, but it's a huge symbol in rock n' roll. The guitar riffs spew a little bit of Queen, too, but then you get MCR ... it's definitely their record, theme and all.

I can't say anymore than I love this album, I bleed for it. At some point, I'm sure the blood in my veins weren't exactly running black, but it sure felt like it. I love, love, love it. Great album from a great band. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Dead,"" ""Welcome to the Black Parade,"" ""House of Wolves,"" ""Cancer,"" ""Mama,"" ""Teenagers,"" ""Disenchanted,"" ... geez, everything!!!

<b>Favorite Track:</b> ""Cancer,"" which is probably the most stripped down track. Very, very, very Queen-ish to me for some reason. But ...

<b>GC vs. MCR?</b> I think ""Cancer"" is like GC's ""The Truth"" ... just vocals and not so much backing. You know what I mean? I really could care less about pitting the two groups together, but I guess in a way I am. I really did like <i>The Chronicles of Life and Death</i>, and I listened to that album non-stop when it first came out. But in a sense, I feel like ... this is <i>the real</i> album they <i>should have</i> came out with. But anyway, they're both different albums, and to be honest, I think <i>The Black Parade</i> suits MCR a whole lot better. 

<b>Crazy song:</b> ""Mama,"" which includes a cameo from Liza Minelli. I know ... wtf? But it's totally awesome. A great song. Somehow, I identify with this song. Crazy. I dunno. Haha."

"event","It's official: I have to wait for a Jackson-esque 30th Anniversary special for my *NSYNC reunion.

But this *NSYNC fan won't skimp on the love I have for Timberlake, even though I know that he in part is why the group won't get back together to do that album they said they were going to do. It's not all him. It's just about how people move on and such.

So, here he comes, Timberlake in all his sophomore glory. It's an effort that I don't think really screams ""sophomore slump,"" mainly because of the calibur he has in his production team. Hello ... it's Timbaland, one of my favorite artists of all time. Timbaland seems to be working on everyone's record these days, but I think there are only a few true people he has ever clicked with: Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake. These days, everything Timbaland touches turns into gold.

But, is this a review for Timbaland, or Justin? I'll get back to Justin, just because it's technically his record. I suppose it can be called a ""concept"" album, based on the title alone. FutureSex/LoveSounds? If this is what the future is, someone get me there quick because it's where I want to be. Right now.

He tricks you, that crazy Justin. You see titles like ""Sexy Ladies"" and under it, in smaller text, it says ""Let Me Talk To You (Prelude)."" So, I'm used to Janet Jackson doing things like these, skits if you must call it something. But these are no skits. These are songs, or extensions of the songs, and they last for over seven minutes. No, I'm not complaining. I'm just frustrated that Justin could ever tease me so ... so much that it makes me want more. 

I've been waiting for this album <i>forever</i>. And I've run out of love for it. That's not a bad thing ... I just think I've loved the hell out of this record. I'm lovestoned, and I've had the album for a day and a half. And speaking of the song of that title, it does this crazy segue during the last part. You've got a club beat in the beginning, almost electronica (at least I think so). And then it segways into a ballad: same words, slower tune. It tripped me out at first, but it works. At first I thought the whole album was just going to be experimentation, sounds I wouldn't like, but I was totally wrong. The best track isn't ""SexyBack,"" (though it is pretty catchy) but I believe it's ""What Goes Around ..."" Something about it gives me chills, with those haunting voices singing in the background. It's almost like ... ""Cry Me A River '06."" 

I don't know, kids. I don't know. But, let me get the word out: <i>FutureSex/LoveSounds</i> could be the new <i>Thriller.</i> I kid, I kid. It's just one of the best I've heard all year. I won't say it's better than <i>Justified</i>, just because that album was his first and just different in every way. A different production, almost a spectacle. A beautiful disaster ... one you just can't stop listening to.

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""SexyBack,"" ""My Love,"" ""LoveStoned,"" ""What Goes Around...,"" ""Chop Me Up,"" ""Summer Love,"" ""(Another Song) All Over Again""

<b>Favorite Tracks:</b> All of those mentioned above. What's more surprising is that I'm really liking ""Chop Me Up,"" which is really strange since it can be classified as Timberlake's ""ghetto joint."" And though I'm not into those type of tracks, I just ... LOVE IT.

<b>Cover Art:</b> Far away without my glasses, it looked like he was just kicking around the disco ball (like a soccer ball). There's something very artsy about the art, though, even 1970s. I think it's the disco ball. I just wish that parental advisory thing wasn't in the corner. It ruined it for me. Damn you, Tipper!!!

<b>Who's got the FLAVA?</b> ""(Another Song) All Over Again"" was co-written with Matt Morris. AKA my crush from when I was a kid. AKA one of the kids from the MMC. I love that they do this. Matt also has his own album, <i>UnSpoken</i>, which is something you should pick up, too. Matt has also written for Christina Aguilera, on her <i>Stripped</i> album.

<b>Throw me a bone!</b> I really want *NSYNC back. I swear, they don't have to dance anymore. Just look at Boyz II Men!!! They sit on stools! See, it can happen. Make it happen, Timberlake! Make it!"

"event","It's been a good three years now since <i>Waiting for my Rocket to Come</i>, Jason Mraz's debut label CD. I have to say now, it was worth the wait.

There's just something about Mraz that's different this time around, and I don't quite know how to put my finger on it. Perhaps its an older Mraz singing on each of the tunes, or perhaps, just the same wordy-kind of guy that he is. It's hard for me to tell, since I've had the same Mraz songs for quite some time now.

The album is full of a lot of ... wordy songs. His first single is ""Wordplay"" afterall, in which he describes his handiness at singing songs with catchy hooks and rhymes. That's what the album is basically full of: the rhymes in which made Mraz famous.

I'm probably the most biased person out there, meaning that I'm one of the biggest Mraz fans out there. I feel as though he could never do no wrong, but, a part of me feels like I've been left hanging out to dry. I think that he's wonderfully talented in his writing and in his music, but a part of me just thinks that this album is his middle. He has more to give, and I think that this is just the beginning. I wouldn't say this is the greatest album he has ever put out, but like I said ... this is the middle. The middle of a truly great career. You know ... when artists put out their <i>greatest album ever</i>, you'll know it. His time will come, and I feel it. As for now, this effort will suffice.

Other than my sentimental feeling for Mraz, the album feels like one of those albums you can definitely chill to. I get this strange feeling of calm when I'm listening to this album walking down the street. The sun shining as the wind blows, and ""Clockwatching"" plays in the background. It's the stuff dreams are made of. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Wordplay,"" ""Geek in the Pink,"" ""Did you get my message?"" ""Clockwatching,"" ""Plane,"" ""Please Don't Tell Her,"" ""Song for a Friend""

<b>My DREAM collaboration ...</b> On ""Did You Get My Message?"" Jason duets with none other than the fabulous Rachael Yamagata. I love it!

<b>Nice CD art:</b> I'm a big fan of CD art(or cover art), and of course, this album is no exception. I love the colors and the way they worked the school theme. 

<b>Favorite Tracks:</b> ""Did You Get My Message?"" ""Clockwatching,"" and ""Please Don't Tell Her""

<b>Best Lyrics:</b> I can't pick. I love all his lyrics. Once again ... biased up the A to Z!!!"

"event","The teenie-pop explosion started in the late 1990s. It died down around the early 2000s. So much for revolution.

There was this one girl named Britney Spears who stormed onto the scene with her provocative song lyrics and videos. She caused controversy because of it, because she seemed to be all oversexual and stuff. 

I think if you look past all of that, this is actually a really catchy album. The title song is probably one of the most memorable out of the 1990s. A catchy beat ... that's what I usually like. If you go onto list all of the other songs, like ""Sometimes"" and ""You Drive Me Crazy,"" they're also considered to be hits off of the album.

But, the songs I like that weren't released are the following ... ""From the Bottom of my Broken Heart"" was actually a damn good song. Wait ... I think it was released. And so was ""Born to Make You Happy."" I don't know what it is about this album, but I think this ranks as one of her best. It's truly pop in it's natural form. 

The lame award, however, goes to ""Soda Pop"" and ""Email My Heart."" I really hate those songs. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""... Baby One More Time,"" ""Sometimes,"" ""You Drive Me Crazy,"" ""Born to Make you Happy,"" ""From the Bottom of my Broken Heart,"" ""I Will Still Love You,"" ""The Beat Goes On""

"event","The White Stripes continue to be the modern day time-warp. I say this mostly because of their clever cover art on their albums ... I don't think you really see too many artists put some kind of concept into their cover art. None the less, their cover art is as clever as their music. 

<i>Get Behind Me Satan</i> is no <i>Elephant</i> ... then again, every White Stripes album seems to have it's own different flavor, or even at times, they mix flavors. On this album, I think it goes up and down. Their first single, ""Blue Orchid"" is something out of the early 90s for me ... it reminds me of a Madonna record/video that nobody has ever seen. It soon dies down, but then picks up again during ""The Doorbell"" and continues on until ""I'm Lonely (But I ain't that lonely yet)."" The beat goes on ... yeah?

I personally enjoy anything that they put out, by the way. Though I don't think this really falls into the category I fit <i>De Stijl</i> into, I think this is in a category all its own. They go back and forth with genres, if you must give it a name. Every song is a different adventure. So, with that being said, <i>Get Behind Me Satan</i> is good for a ride. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Blue Orchid,"" ""My Doorbell,"" ""Forever for her (Is Over For Me),"" ""Little Ghost,"" ""White Moon,"" ""Take, Take, Take,"" ""I'm Lonely (But I ain't that lonely yet)""

"event","Joss Stone is a savior of music in disguise. She's young, talented, beautiful, has a great stage presence, and even better, a true love and appreciation for music. 

Her first album, <i>The Soul Sessions</i> is basically made up of cover songs. It's not like doing a cover album is a horrible thing, by the way. But I think the true motivation of this album was to re-create classic songs. I love the idea, and I think it was fabulous. 

You can almost feel the soul ooze through each of the tracks. Before hearing Joss, I never really heard any of these songs before. I'm hearing them for the first time, though I know they're classic songs. 

It's fun to hear the songs I do know through someone else's voice, of course. ""Fell In Love with a Boy,"" which is actually a cover of The White Stripes' ""Fell In Love with a Girl"" is probably the most interesting spin on a track I've ever heard. She took Jack White's electro-suite and made it slow, calm, and cool. And, ""For the Love of You"" ... she did the same thing. She made an Isley song  ... well, calm and cool as well, cooler than it already was. 

I love this album to death, and I'm not joking. I love Joss' voice, I love the songs, and I think that Joss Stone has saved music. It kind of disturbs me that people were describing her as a Britney Spears clone who can sing. But I think she's waaay ahead of Britney, even though she's young. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""The Chokin' Kind,"" ""Super Duper Love,"" ""Fell in Love with a Boy,"" ""Victim of a Foolish Heart,"" ""Dirty Man,"" ""I Had a Dream,"" ""For the Love of You""

<b>My repeat song:</b> ""Victim of a Foolish Heart""

<b>Cover Art:</b> I love it when they make albums resemble old LPs. I think it's classic. 

<b>Personal Tip:</b> Buy this album at Walmart. Tower and Virgin and even Best Buy will charge you more than you can afford (or need to spend). Walmart has it for something like 9-10 bucks."

"event","I can't even begin to describe how I feel about this Conor Oberst. Is he a genius? Some guy who likes to experiment with his music? Something? Anything?

Oberst released two albums this year at the same time ... this one, and also the acoustic <i>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</i>. I don't know if this was to mess with our heads, in a sense. One's acoustic, the other sounds like Moby's bastard child. 

All right, I'm kidding about that one. <i>Digital Ash</i> is probably one of the most ""experimental"" albums I have ever heard, if you can even call it that. Experimental. It's electronic, but at the same time, it's ... I don't even know. I don't even know if I should really classify it as ""electronic."" That sounds cold and empty in a sense, which, is the complete opposite of his songs and this album. 

All I know is that I enjoy this guy waaaay too much. Too much.

Perhaps the main thing I really love about this guy (and the album, and his other albums) is his powerful songwriting. It's almost written in story form. But, what am I saying ... songwriting <i>is</i> writing stories. 

Damn. He's even got me confused about what the hell I should write about him. Probably one of the best of 2005, and even my lifetime. 

I think I have more to say about <i>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</i>, mainly because I adapt to road-trip sounding albums way too quickly. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Gold Mine Gutted,"" ""Take it Easy (Love Nothing),"" ""Ship in a Bottle,"" ""Theme to Pinata,"" ""Easy/Lucky/Free""

<b>Best lyric:</b> I can't even pick. I'm whoring this guy to the max, and everything he writes is like candles in the wind. Seriously.

<b>Cool video:</b> Check out his video for ""Easy/Lucky/Free"" for the cool special effects. I sat watching it, wondering how the hell Conor writes so well backwards. But I figure it's just a camera trick (flipped image) ... right? I hope so."

"event","It was all a dream ... 

... or was it? I can't figure out where these girls went. I think they came out with a new album a year and a half ago. And then ... nothing.

There was this big hoopla surrounding these girls at the time they came out. First of all, this was during the so-called height of the boyband craze (with Britney Spears not far behind). There was this hunger for a lot of these teen groups or something like that. Even P.Diddy got in on the game ... he basically got five white girls together and signed them to his hip-hop label, Bad Boy. And then ... voila! P.Diddy became the Max Martin of the West. I'm kidding. He supported these girls, produced them, took them under his wing. He gave them the power ... they took it. Blah, blah. They released an album, were successful, and so forth.

None the less, <i>It was all a Dream</i> had its high points. There was that one ""infectous"" single, ""He Loves U Not."" They followed it up with ""This Is Me,"" which I liked better than the other song. That's about it after that. They remade ""Mr. Telephone Man."" It wasn't so bad. 

Dream was ... well. I don't know how to really describe them. They had one good singer (I believe it was Ashley, the one with short blonde hair). They had the eye-candy (the Britney Spears look-alike, Melissa. By the way, she left the group to be an actress. Hmm. Didn't see that one coming.) The ""shy girl"" Diana. And the one nobody had anything to say about (I don't even remember her name. Oh yeah. Holly. Haha!)

I personally bought this album because of ""He Loves U Not."" It was catchy, so I bought it. I listened to it, played it out so much. Then I listened to the rest of the album. They have some so-so songs, songs you'd expect from a pop group, but infused with some of that ""Bad Boy"" flavor. What do you expect P.Diddy to do? *Not* have any influence at all? Please. 

For a group that was just starting out at the time, they sure had a lot of songs on one album. I think I can stomach 10 or 11 songs. Save the privilege of having <i>seventeen</i> songs for your greatest hits record. Whenever that'll come out. 

Besides that complaint, there aren't enough slow songs. I think P.Diddy didn't realize that rule. When you have a pop group such as Dream, which is clearly manufactured in the template of BSB or *NSYNC, you must, must, must ... have slow songs. You must have a staple slow song. If you do not, you do not succeed.

Which is probably why you never hear from Dream. Ever. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""He Loves U Not,"" ""In My Dreams,"" ""This is Me,"" ""I Don't Like Anyone,"" ""Pain,"" ""Mr. Telephone Man,"" ""Miss You,"" ""How Long""

<b>Remix that isn't so bad!</b> ""He Loves U Not"" (Remix) ... please. You know there'd be a remix.

<b>Intro-lude galore:</b> You know P.Diddy and his intro-interlude stuff? I liked it on <i>CrazySexyCool</i>. It fit in. But these chicks were like fifteen, and it was annoying. Especially that one girl with her baby voice. Ugh. The ghetto sixteen year old in me says ""I'msickadiss."" Please. Talk to the hand, cause the face don't wanna listen. 

<b>Nightmares for LIFE:</b> Do a search on their group on yahoo or google. Click on the link. The first picture you'll see is somebody's BOOTIE! And I mean Ashley's! I think that's her name. Anyway ... that is just something I don't wanna see. Have they gotten skanky? It looks like."

It could be my longing for the past, or anything of the past for that matter. I figure I needed to have a hug. A huge, Sweedish pop hug from some old friends of mine.

I'm talking about *NSYNC, by the way. I wish they would just give it up and make another album! For old times' sake. It's frustrating for this old skool *NSYNC fan. Although, I am glad I didn't get the *NSYNC tattoo ... and I don't mean those two dollar ones you'd get at Sam Goody. 

As I listen to this album, I am reminded as to why I loved them in the first place. The minute ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" started playing, I had visions of my sister and I trying to get the dances down in the living room. My shoulders started doing some weird motions and I began to laugh. I remember being one of the thousands of girls in the crowd during the concerts and screaming my head off, and listening to all of the songs, singing along. I remember loving JC forever and always. In many ways, I still do. But at the same time ... I have let him go. If you love them, let them go free. And blah, blah, blah. 

I know that everyone hated on the ""boy bands"" and quite frankly, they were right to criticize. A group of white guys in a harmony group? Please. I, on the other hand, felt there was a whole lot of hypocrisy in the whole situation. Yeah, they didn't play instruments. They did, however, sing. They didn't have bad voices. Everyone made fun of the fact that it was a bunch of white boys with their own personas (example: Joey Fatone - the chubby ladies man haha; Chris Kirkpatrick - the OLD one). But, nobody ever went to criticize black guy groups. They didn't play instruments, but sung as well. There was a huge, massive explosion of the black boy groups in the 90s ... do you hear of them much anymore? (Jagged Edge don't count ... they are in EVERYBODY'S hook and it's a wonder they have their own album. Please.) Was there an uproar about the fact that they didn't play instruments? No. I don't know why, and I'd rather not try and give a reason. People might instigate stuff. The end. 

I'm probably biased, but I really think that this was a classic album. If not *NSYNC's best album <i>ever</i>. Not only did they lay it out with the pop, but I loved the remakes of ""Everything I Own"" (Lance in his deep voice speaking solo!) and ""Sailing."" It was in ""Sailing"" that JC truly shows that he is a wonderful singer. Everyone had their eyes on Justin, but clearly the best singer in the group is JC. They only liked Justin because of his freshly bleached perm. For every group, there is a Michael Jackson. But you know the most talented is Marlon. If you know what I mean.

For me, this album is a classic. A classic album from a group that needs to make another freakin' album! Are they nuts? I know that Justin and the rest of the clan are doing their own things. But they need to throw the old school fans a bone, here. We need love! You need love! We all reeeally need love.

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Tearin Up My Heart,"" ""I Just Wanna Be With You,"" ""For the Girl who has Everything,"" ""God Must've Spent...,"" ""I Want You Back,"" ""Everything I Own,"" ""I Drive Myself Crazy,"" ""Sailing""

<b>Worst song *NSYNC has EVER done:</b> ""I Need Love"" (worst. song. EVER.)

<b>Best f*cking song *NSYNC has EVER done:</b> ""I Want You Back"" (after all these years, it still gets my blood pumping and my bootie shakin.)

<b>Total sleeze song, but still catchy:</b> ""Giddy Up""

<b>Funny thing that happened while watching them on TV...</b> Before I ever saw them perform, whether it was live or on TV, I always thought that Chris had the low voice, and Lance had the high voice. And also that Lance bore a striking resemblance to Ellen Degeneres. Back then, of course. 

<b>My favorite *NSYNC story:</b> Well, I have two. The first one was at one of the many concerts I went to, and JC had begun to sing ""Sailing."" With the magic of special effects and pyro (ha!), JC lifted up into the air and moved his arms towards me. I was right behind the spotlight, and it was like he was flying towards me, like the angel he is. The second was during the second leg of the <i>Celebrity</i> tour, and they were close to us. And they broke out into a Beatles medley, ranging from ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" to ""Hey Jude."" It was a hit with the crowd, and everyone felt all hunky dory. Including me."

It all changes one night ...

... and. If I wanted to do a movie review site, I would go on. But frankly, I would love for you to go out and rent this movie and see it for yourself. Come on. Netflix is the key! I will say that this film cuts close to hom for me. Finding an identity (or having one) is confusing to those who keep getting mixed messages. 

None the less, the soundtrack showcases music done by the Filipino community. Infuse some sound bites from the film, and it all gets tied together.

While I do skip over most of the songs to get to my favorites, I do think that this album (or compilation) is a prime example of the talent that is apparent in the Filipino community. You've got a mix of rock, hip hop, R&B, techno, pop ... you name it. 

So ... my advice? Get the album! Watch the film! There's something for everyone. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b>  ""Intro to Magic"" - Silverscene, ""I Need To Know"" - Innerlude, ""Come See Us (Johnson & Johnson Remix)"" - KNT feat San Quinn, ""Set It"" - Pacifics, ""Invasion of the Octopus People"" - DJ Qbert, ""My Friend"" - DnH, ""Devoted"" - Julie Plug, ""Southern Dreamer"" - Emm Gryner

<b>Did you know?</b> The movie was filmed back around 1997-98, and came out in 2001? It took them a long time to get someone to distribute this film. It was rated R ... which was just for language. Distributors didn't want to show it because of the language, and wanted them to change it. They didn't, and the movie still went on to be seen and was a success.

<b>My story of bliss (haha):</b> I went to see this film during the closing night (?) of the San Francisco Asian American Film Festival, and I got to meet three out of four Basco brothers (yes ... there are more of them)! I was extremely nervous meeting Dante, and well ... I got a hug and all that crap. I look back on it and I just hate myself. I was such a teenie bopper. Anyway, all the brothers I met were cool, and they autographed my CD. It's one of my prized possessions, as lame as it sounds. One of the best nights of my life. There's more details to it as to why I loved that night so much, but. I'd rather not bore you with the details."

"event","Everyone remembers Lauryn Hill as the girl in The Fugees. Also an actress. A whole lot of other things.

But, it wasn't until her debut solo album, <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i>, that she became a bonafide star. Her deep vocals added much depth to each and every song on this very personal, almost biographical album. 

The album blends R&B with that old time soul music, mixed in with the modernity of singing accompanied with rapping. These days, we can't really seem to get enough of it since we have the likes of Alicia Keys and John Legend on the scene. It was with this album that set off the trend. Not only a commercial success, but it also won Lauryn Hill a couple of Grammys. 

What makes this album very good is, like I said ... it's got a whole lot of depth. I listen to ""To Zion,"" a song dedicated to her son, and I feel overwhelmed by the love she feels for him. In ""Ex-Factor,"" she talks about still loving someone so deeply, even though it hurts her so bad. She talks about her beginning as a youth in ""Every Ghetto, Every City."" She disses those who thought she wouldn't be where she was on ""Superstar."" I could go on ... every song has its own story. 

Perhaps the best song is the title of the album ... ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" is a cautionary tale, one which teaches us that we always have the answer. No matter what happens. 

This was one of my favorite albums of that year. Above all things, this album has one common theme: love. I don't know about anyone else, but this album is one of the few classics to come out of the R&B/hip hop world at the time. Blending soul, rap, R&B is a tricky thing ... I'm not surprised that she did it in one try.

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Lost Ones,"" ""Ex-Factor,"" ""To Zion,"" ""Doo Wop (That Thing),"" ""I Used to Love Him,"" ""Everything is Everything,"" ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill""

<b>Did You know?</b> There's a hidden track on the album. Maybe even two? ;) I'll tell you this: they're songs you'll like."

"event","This is probably the album that will define my high school days. Forever. 

I can't tell you how long I waited for this album to come out. Everyone knows that there can be delays on certain albums. I think I pre-ordered this album a year before it actually came out. They kept pushing back the date. The guy at Sam Goody (R.I.P, you old chain store, you.) was like ""Damn ... you ordered this early."" I didn't mean to sound like the crazy obsessed *NSYNC fan. But, then again ... that's what I really was. 

Anyway. This album was their ""breakthrough/breakout"" album, as opposed to their American debut, which was self-titled. While I do have love for that album, and their (hopefully not last-last) last album <i>Celebrity</i>, <i>No Strings Attached</i> was something definitely new and different. They figured they had something to prove at the time, and quite frankly, they proved it well. 

<i>No Strings Attached</i> is a blend of pop and R&B and a whole lot of other things. It was a potpourri album, if you must call it something. For one thing, they did decide to keep Max Martin on the bill, famous for his Swedish-pop influenced tunes. And while keeping close to those roots, they also enlisted people like Kevin ""Shek'spere"" Briggs and Lisa ""Left-Eye"" Lopes to make them a bit more ... street? Yeah, that sounds about right. Mix in some Richard Marx and you've got yourself a newly designed pop album! Wouldn't you agree? 

At times this album is fast. Well, the first few songs. Their first single ""Bye Bye Bye"" was supposed to be a new genre of pop ... dirty pop? That's it. Dirty pop. I still like saying that after all these years. ""It's Gonna Be Me"" is another form of it, I'll say. This was also a foray into their own songwriting, mostly done on this album by JC and Justin. 

I figure what makes this album probably the best *NSYNC has ever put out is because of the meaning. It's not just because the songs are pretty much great and poppy, but it's because it was the first album they didn't release under the Lou Pearlman empire (which isn't entirely true ... there's still that Transcontinental logo reaaaally small on the cover of the album. And also, that's why the album didn't come out on time, because of the legal trouble). ""No Strings Attached"" meant they were free. And, so forth.

And, while I'd love to give a full blown history of the meaning behind this album, and what it took to get it made ... I won't. Mainly because I'm tired. And, I'd rather forget about the past and look to the future. And, here's to hoping they'll be making a new album soon. Hopefully very soon. So we can get this BSB v. NSYNC rivalry back up again like East v. West. Homie!

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Bye Bye Bye,"" ""It's Gonna Be Me,"" ""Space Cowboy,"" ""It Makes Me Ill,"" ""This I Promise You,"" ""No Strings Attached,"" ""Digital Get Down,"" ""I Thought She Knew""

<b>Sad fact:</b> I know the dance moves to the videos for ""Bye Bye Bye"" and ""It's Gonna Be Me."" Even if I won't listen to this album for a long time, I will find myself uncontrollably doing the moves to these videos during the songs. It just happens. Weird.

<b>Favorite NSYNC member at the time:</b> JC. Before all the hoopla. He still is the best singer in the group. Timberlake who?"

"event","There's just something about buying albums that you weren't able to when they first came out. And now, through the beauty of Amoeba Records, I now have my own copy of Bobby Brown's <i>Don't Be Cruel</i> for the all low price of $4.99.

Anyway. The photo of Bobby Brown on the cover looks like some weird super flash-back to the late 80s: shoulder pads, eraser-like hairdos. Yeah, it was cool at one time. (And I really mean just one time.)

<i>Don't Be Cruel</i> is the typical R&B album, with the upbeat, and of course the slow jams. I never really noticed it, but some of the great slow jams came out of the late 1980s. For some reason, I always thought some songs from the 80s were from the 70s. But alas ... I am wrong. 

I don't want to drag this out, mainly because I'm not too much of a Bobby Brown fan. But, he did have some good songs like ""My Prerogative,"" the super slow jam ""Roni."" What <i>is</i> a roni, a tenderoni? Well, it's a girl. I figure if you had your prom in 1988 or 1989 ... then they played ""Roni"" and you danced with your boyfriend with his shoulder pads and your high hair. 

I think ""Rock Wit'cha"" is one of the slow jams that was overshadowed by ""Roni,"" though I feel that it has the same charm. There's nothing like a good slow jam. 

And, how could I forget that mega-hit ""Every Little Step"" where Bobby did some crazy dancing in his video? I can't. It's a classic, forever burned into my retinas. And brain ... whatever's left.

All in all ... a satisfying album. Mainly because of my sad attachment to anything R&B from the 1980s. It brings me back to those good ol' days.

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""My Prerogative,"" ""Roni,"" ""Rock wit'cha,"" ""Every Little Step,"" ""I Really Love You Girl""

<b>Am I dreaming?</b> But, didn't Eddie on the tv show ""Family Matters"" want to be like Bobby Brown? I vaguely remember an episode where he was doing the dance to the ""Every Little Step"" video or something. He had the same hair and even did the blazer with no shirt under-thing. Haha.

<b>Weird for me to read and comprehend:</b> I thought him and New Edition didn't part on such good terms? I'm reading these liner notes and he calls them his ""home boys."" And then he busts out with some weird nicknames for Ralph Tresvant. Huh? (By the way. Ralph Tresvant is sooooooooooo much cuter than Bobby Brown. Heheee.)"

"event","I think everyone in their right mind remembers that song ""Buddy Holly."" It was accompanied by this amazingly state of the art (at the time) music video, where Weezer performed at Arnold's on ""Happy Days."" Remember ""Happy Days?"" Remember how it wasn't on when they had this album out? Yeah. State of the freakin' art. 

So, why did it take me so long to buy this album? I have no idea. I think due to my lack of funds, my lack of knowledge, my lack of buying old stuff that really got me. I seem to buy things that are only on sale now. This album was ten bucks at Virgin. They did put out another edition, a ten year anniversary one. Whatever. I like having the original, just because I feel closer to 1994 that way.

I'm a little angry at myself that it took that long ... to buy the CD, I mean. They have some good songs on this thing! I figure I like them a little more right now because I'm more into this type of music. Does Weezer classify as EMO? I kind of associate EMO with slow people. It's supposed to be slow, isn't it? 

Forget that. <i>Weezer</i>, a.k.a. ""the blue album"" is full of poppy-like tunes. I don't even know what they really classify as. Soft rock? Slow rock, medium rock? I suppose. Kind of a mix of punk as well. I have no idea. I don't even want to put them under any classification because my brain would start hurting.

But let's get down to the nitty gritty of it all, since I don't really do that anymore. The record starts out with this tune called ""My name is Jonas"" and it's basically about some guy named Jonas singing about something. I know that sounds pretty lame, but it's actually got a nice beat and everything. It's followed with many more poppy songs that I can't really make sense of right now due to my lack of concentration.

The best song by far on this album is ""The World has turned and left me here,"" the classic tune of loneliness after a breakup. It does sound a bit creepy at times (""I just made love with your sweet memory""), but the melody is good enough to accompany you on a roadtrip while the sun is setting. And of course, the most infectious song is their infamous hit, ""Buddy Holly."" After all of these years, this song can still get me to move. 

Let's face it: I don't know much about Weezer. I know <i>of</i> them. I don't know the name of the members, I won't claim to have been a fan for a long time. I don't know what color socks they wear or if they like long walks on the beach. With this album, I would like to get to know them. Hell, I feel like I already know them just by listening to their music. This is a great road album, by the way. I'm glad I finally bought this thing. It's almost like the first time. (The general first time for a lot of things. Perv.)

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""My Name is Jonas,"" ""The World has turned and left me here,"" ""Buddy Holly,"" ""Undone- The Sweater song,"" ""Holiday,"" ""Only in dreams""

<b>WEIRD track award goes to:</b> ""Undone- the Sweater song"" ... geez. 

<b>Somewhat profound/sweet lyrics:</b> ""I talked for hours to your wallet photograph/ And you just listened You laughed enchanted by my intellect/ Or maybe you didn't"" - from ""The World has turned and left me here""

<b>Greatest lyrics ... EVER:</b> ""What's with these homies, dissin' my girl/ Why do they gotta front?"" - from ""Buddy Holly"""

"event","If there's something I hate about musicians, it's the hype. The overhype, and all that jazz. If people keep talking about somebody, saying that they're good and everything, it irritates me. Mainly because if there's so much talk, how come <i>I</i> haven't heard of them?

Of course, I'm not the first person that should know who's good or not. I'm up on artists of a certain genre, but not a lot. I used to be up on hip-hop a lot, but I think over the years everything has changed. 

So now, this small intro brings me onto Kanye West, whom at first, I thought was overhyped. What was the big deal with him? I think whenever that song ""All Falls Down"" first played, I would always skip over it. The first time I gave it a listen all the way through ... I started to like him. What's up with that? I figure I should just listen to songs all the way through, even though I'm annoyed.

That leads me to buying <i>The College Dropout</i>, which I have to say, is a pretty good album. I think the last ""hip-hop"" album I bought (that wasn't old or used) was the soundtrack to <u>Brown Sugar</u>, which happened to have some songs produced by Kanye himself. Weird how that ties in? I suppose so. 

There's a lot on this album that I could praise, and of course, I'm too lazy to type it all out this time. I have to say that I was probably wrong to not think of Kanye as anything. But one listen to this album has automatically made it one of my favorites to listen to right now. 

Also! That song ""Slow Jamz"" is on the album! A lot of songs I've heard in passing are on this album, which I think is particularly awesome. 

I don't even want to pad it, or even hype it up. All I have to say: I like this album. Good, good, good.

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""We Don't Care,"" ""All Falls Down,"" ""Jesus Walks,"" ""Workout Plan,"" ""Slow Jamz,"" ""Two Words,"" ""Through the Wire""

<b>Cool aspect:</b> I like the CD theme ... like a yearbook. It almost makes me wanna be a college drop out. (Hell, I'm thisclose to being one, anyway.)"

<b> [ edit: june 2, 2005 ]</b> I'm probably over the fact that I hated this album the first time. I know enjoy this album way too much, and I use it as a workout album.

"event","It's been about ten years since the major label debut of Green Day. AKA, America's Sweethearts, America's favorite punk band of recent. 

It's kind of weird to put the label on them as ""America's Sweethearts,"" but then again, can you put another label on them that doesn't describe all of the recent success they've had? You look at <i>American Idiot</i>, which has already gone platinum and is selling tons of records overseas, as well ... it's not just a best-selling album, but it's also a critically-acclaimed one. Critically-acclaimed wouldn't be associated with Green Day ... would it? Maybe back in the day it wouldn't. But right now, that's what they are. Critically acclaimed, media darlings. 

But forget all of that stuff. We should just go back to when all of it started for them. It didn't necessarily just start with <i>Dookie</i>, however, it did put them on the map. They had their beginnings in Vallejo, CA, and soon took off in Oakland and Berkeley, particularly the East Bay. Long story short, they got a major record label deal, and with hits like ""Longview,"" ""Basket Case,"" and ""When I Come Around,"" Green Day became a household name. Punk legends. At least in my eyes. 

I was young, and precious back in those days. Freshly twelve years old, maybe once or twice or a couple of times had I been exposed to music other than R&B and Rap at that time. I think Green Day was the group that might have turned me onto a new genre of punk music. I would say that my musical genes had been exposed to all the different kinds that existed, but I was soley a urban contemporary type of person. I suppose that changed when one day, a kid in my music class brought ""Basket Case"" as a song to play. Then, my local station KMEL had played ""When I Come Around"" on the nightly top ten. I was surprised. What the fuck was happening?

Then, it started. I suppose I owe Green Day a bit of gratitude for giving me something different and interesting to listen to. I talk about them like they changed my life somehow, but I think in a way they did. Now that I'm older, I'm not just into the melodies and guitar riffs, but I'm into the lyrics, and I find that lyrics are an important part of songs, too. 

Anyway. I suppose I could get all sentimental and shit, but I have to talk about <i>Dookie</i> without crying (ha). I've been reading around lately how everyone thought they were snot-nosed punks (okay. Well. Alright.) at first, but while you listen, you hear the potential. Not just the familiar three chords they all use, but the way they use it. There's the drum beats laid by Tre Cool and more guitar stylings of Mike Dirnt, and then you've got the strained, pseudo-British sounding Billie Joe. Maybe it didn't seem like a good combo at first, but if you just listen to it over and over ... hell. It all sounds great. Long story short, all hell broke loose, and all the snot nosed kids in America finally had a group they could identify with in the early 90s. It's weird to say early 90s. It means I'm old. 

From <i>Dookie</i> to <i>American Idiot</i>, you see the growth. It's not just the songs, it's not just the lyrics, but it's just everything. There were people in the industry, even everywhere, that thought they wouldn't be around right now. It's true, they were kind of going down for a little bit of time. They stuck with it, tried to see what they could do to make their music have more meaning, and challenge themselves to do something better than the next. I think that's what makes them one of the greatest bands of our generation, if any. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Longview,"" ""Welcome to Paradise,"" ""Pulling Teeth,"" ""Basket Case,"" ""She,"" ""When I Come Around,"" ""Coming Clean,"" ""F.O.D.""

<b>According to ... </b> <a href=""http://www.greendayauthority.com"">the Green Day Authority</a>, ""Coming Clean"" is about coming out of the closet. That Billie Joe might have been bisexual at a time? Didn't know that, and it's interesting. 

<b>Did you know?</b> The video for ""When I Come Around"" was filmed in San Francisco? I was watching the video last night, I see them walking on the street and you see a sign for MUNI. And I swear, they're walking in Powell Station. Everytime I'm there now, I pretend I'm Billie Joe and I unhook one of the phones ;)

<b>Did you know? (Pt. 2)</b> They had to re-print the CDs because on the backcover, because there was an Ernie in the crowd. Jim Henson & Co. didn't like that, so they had to print it without the puppet. However, I went to Amoeba a couple of days ago to buy another copy, since I somehow mysteriously lost the one I bought, and you can find copies of the album with Ernie on the backcover. So the Green Day freaks (such as myself) feel a bit of satisfaction when they get an original copy in their hands. Hooray for us. The one I bought had a brown tray and no Ernie. Sigh."

"event","I'm trying to make it a point to support the groups that aren't necessarily ""big"" in a lot of people's eyes. These are the groups that make up the framework of a foundation, the foundation of the unknowns who might suddenly find themselves in a different element all themselves.

But, enough of that stuff. I finally got my hands on the new Plain White T's album, which, they plugged endlessly during their concert with Simple Plan and Mae at The Fillmore last year. I, of course, was a total teenie bopper around the group, because they had the makings of a band that has massive appeal: good songs, good music, stage presence, and of course, cute band members. 

<i>All That We Needed</i> is their follow-up to their first album, <i>Stop</i>, which I also bought at the concert. When that album was released, there were other members included in the group. I believe Tom, the lead singer, is one of the only (if not the only) original members of this Chicago-based band. That album had the catchy, upbeat tunes of falling in love, falling out of love, telling the person you love to get a new attitude, and so forth. Their latest album doesn't fall short of those songs, and frankly, that's good enough for me. 

The title song starts off the disc with a drum intro, followed plainly by some vocals. Pure and simple, it's a winning combination. Whatever that means. Instead of going through song by song, I might as well just tell you that I enjoyed this album very much. It's not just because I like their band, but the songs are catchy, talk about love, and so forth. The winning formula that captures my heart time and time again. What else is new?

I met three out of five of the band members last year, and I can tell you it was refreshing to see a group like this, unaware of the bigger fame that they're destined for. It's one thing to see a band in it's beginnings, but to be able to talk to them about how they started out and see them walking around selling their own CD after the show is another. To be able to come out as the ""small"" act during a concert, and be able to charm the pants (and panties? Ha) off of the crowd is another amazing feat in itself. Their ability to connect with their fans is amazing, and it's a wonder that they aren't as ""big"" as their fans feel that they should be (and are). I say to all of you, be on the lookout for these guys, because they're coming up in this place really soon. 

It was also nice to hug Tim, talk to him, and have him smile at me, since he's my favorite, and the cutest. Ha.

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""All That We Needed,"" ""Take Me Away,"" ""Sad Story,"" ""Lazy Day Afternoon,"" ""Anything,"" ""Sing My Best,"" ""Hey There Delilah""

"event","I bought this album for two reasons:

1) It was $7.99 at the Virgin Megastore
and
2) I couldn't get the themesong to ""One Tree Hill"" out of my head.

So, now I have this CD called <i>Chariot</i> by none other than Gavin DeGraw. Big voice, big talent. Someone called him the new Elton John for our generation. I forget who said that, but, it's hard not to agree. 

This album basically plays like a soundtrack for a WB teen show. Which, I think is why the people at OTH chose him to sing the themesong for their show. Or, chose the song. I don't know if he actually wrote the song for the show. I don't think he did, to be honest.

Each song has its own style, its own story. They all sound very familiar, and I think it's because all those shows use his songs! They're all catchy and fun, and even the ballads are catchy. They put you in that mood ... solemn, yet thoughtful. 

Besides the song ""I Don't Want To Be,"" I think the best song on the album is ""More than Anyone,"" which could totally work as a wedding song. ""Crush"" tells the tale of having a crush on somebody (ha ... we all know what that's like), so of course I'm liking that song a lot. 

In conclusion, there's a song for everybody on this album. And, if you're a piano loving music person, then this album is definitely for you. I think almost every song has a piano. Maybe he really is the new piano man. 

<b>Key tracks:</b> ""Follow Through,"" ""Chariot,"" ""(Nice to meet You) Anyway,"" ""Crush,"" ""I Don't Want To Be,"" ""More than Anyone""

"event","I first saw Michelle Branch perform on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien,"" where she sung her mega-hit, ""Everywhere."" A pretty catchy song about seeing someone you love everywhere you go. Pretty tame for a young kid at the time (18, 19 years old). I liked the song, so I bought the CD. That's the story.

I wasn't surprised that I liked this CD a lot, though. A lot of songs about liking somebody, loving somebody, being with somebody, saying goodbye to somebody. I really used to eat that stuff up, and I probably still do. 

I suppose Michelle was going the ""first album"" road, which means that the first album always contains music that people will enjoy. The friendly sounding tunes, the innocent tales of love, and so forth. There are hardly any songs that you need to skip over. Well, the one I skip over is ""Drop in the Ocean,"" because it sounds a little too techno for this album. A little too techno for me, and I guess it just doesn't seem to fit in with all the songs, besides the fact that it deals with loving someone, etc. 

I also like how the songs remind me of Hanson songs: same chords, lyrics, and even in ""If Only She Knew,"" it sounds as if Hanson is doing the backing vocals. Maybe that's why I enjoy Michelle Branch to a T. It's nice that they're even friends with each other. There was a time when I wanted her and Taylor Hanson to make babies. I kid you not.

This album does have a lot of ups, and I attribute that to the fact that Michelle could probably be our new Jewel. The sultry singer/songwriting guitarist. It's good that she's still young, because she can still continue to make more music. She did that with <i>Hotel Paper</i>, which I think was a good album as well. But, I think she could have done better. Really. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Everywhere,"" ""All You Wanted,"" ""Something to Sleep To,"" ""If Only She Knew,"" ""Goodbye To You""

<b>Songs I had on repeat when I broke up with my then-boyfriend:</b> ""All You Wanted,"" ""Goodbye To You"" (I know. So typical I want to slap myself.)

<b>Something about the cover that weirds me out:</b> When I first bought the CD, the cover picture was her against a red background. I opened the CD case to find the picture of her in front of a blue sky. And I thought to myself, ""This could be the front cover, too. I like it better, anyway."" For a while, I didn't play the CD, and when I found it again, I found that I left it on the blue cover, face up. Now when I go to stores, I get confused because I see versions of the album where the blue side is the front cover. So then I think to myself, ""Wasn't the cover the other picture?"" To this day, I am still confused. Geez."

"event","The first movie soundtrack entry. Don't worry--this won't take long.

The soundtrack for <u>New York Minute</u> is your basic soundtrack that has all the pop/punk/rock/old hits that you'll probably recognize in a second after it begins to play. I don't know if there are really any ""original"" songs written for the soundtrack, except maybe Jason Mraz's completely ""new"" version of ""Curbside Prophet,"" which is entitled ""Curbside Prophet '04."" His song is probably the most catchy of the compilation.

Did I say compilation? Isn't that what most soundtracks are these days? There aren't many soundtracks out there that get music ""inspired from the motion picture"" or something like that. But, I suppose this time, the CD compilation is a keeper. It's also a keeper because I bought it used for $1.99. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Curbside Prophet '04"" - Jason Mraz, ""Vacation"" - Simple Plan, ""Wave Goodbye"" - Steadman, ""One Way or Another"" - Blondie

<b>Catchy song, weird ass name for a band:</b> ""Hey Driver"" - Lucky Boys Confusion

<b>Song that <i>should be</i> on the soundtrack:</b> ""New York Minute"" of course! Who sung it, anyway? I can't remember. But it was an 80s song, if I recall correctly. Anyway, I never saw the movie. I frankly do not care."

Damien Rice somehow makes me think of a rougher, more genuinely blunt John Mayer. He yells, but it's not like some ugly thing. It's almost poetic in a sense. 

This review will be short, mainly because <i>b-sides</i> contains only seven songs, some of which are repeated. Once you start playing it, you're bombarded with the straight forward track ""the professor & la fille danse."" Following up are other gems, like ""woman like a man"" and also ""delicate."" 

I saw Damien Rice perform on that show ""Austin City Limits"" and I have to admit that I immediately fell in love with him. Not only does he have a good voice and is incredibly talented, but his music puts me to sleep. My own private lullaby. That's all I need in this point in time.

"event","Now, after a Boyz II Men review, what good is it to jump to another genre? None, nada. Not good. So, we're staying in R&B for now.

So, I chose to give the next entry to Soul For Real. Remember them? A band of singing brothers from New York. With the help of Heavy D, they were able to produce a couple of R&B hits in the year of '94, roughly '95. Remember? I hope you do.

I remember them quite well. There was this thing in my music class where we had to bring songs that we enjoyed and say why we liked them. I brought ""Candy Rain."" There was another song that I remember somebody else brough, which was ""Basket Case"" by Green Day. But, that's another entry all in itself. 

""Candy Rain"" was my favorite song of the year. I especially liked the music video, even though it made absolutely no sense to me (one minute they were in front of a frilly turquoise curtain, the next, it was red! Whhhaat?). 

But, listening to the album is certainly bringing me back. ""Candy Rain"" was a good jam, as was ""Every Little Thing I Do."" ""All in My Mind"" followed, and so forth. 

The only thing I can't stand on this album is the use of flutes. Why are there so many flutes on this album? Was Heavy D on crack? Anyway, if you long for the good ol' days of early 90s R&B, this is a good choice. It has a good mixture of subject matter. Though, I don't think I like the idea of then-14 year old Jason singing about ""making love all night by the fireplace."" 

I shudder at the thought.

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Candy Rain,"" ""Every Little Thing I Do,"" ""All In My Mind,"" ""If You Want It,"" ""I Don't Know"" 

<b>Remakes GALORE! (Awesome covers):</b> ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" ""If Only You Knew""

"event","There's something I miss about R&B: in fact, I think R&B is missing all together now in the music world.

There was a time that I was heavily R&B influenced, and that there was nothing else in my CD player. I loved it to no end, and somehow, it just slipped away. 

I kind of blame it on the rise of rap, hip-hop, hell, even those rap songs with the R&B singers being guest stars. Now everything seems to be blended together, and it's as if R&B never existed. 

So, that's why it's kind of a refreshing reminder of what it used to be like with Boyz II Men's ""II,"" which in my opinion was their best album. ""Cooleyhighharmony"" was pretty good as well, but ""II"" came after that album, so they were pretty hyped up. While listening to this album, it just takes me back to a time when the R&B groups were a-plenty, but lately, you don't see too many out there. Some would also blame it on the rise of the teenie pop explosion during the late 90s, but all those groups are gone. Where have they gone? Solo or somewhere else. 

But, it's albums like ""II"" that stand the test of time. It's a shame that Boyz II Men hasn't exactly lived up to the fame that they once had, but I think it's because of the rise of other talents that has made them disappear over the years. They've become one of those groups that maybe put out an album every year, and only a select few hear about it. No more shots up to the top of the charts--nothing. 

""II"" still delivers after all these years, though. Of course, no one can forget the mega hits ""I'll Make Love To You"" and ""On Bended Knee,"" and my personal favorite, ""Water Runs Dry."" Boyz II Men were the kings of slow jams, but that didn't mean they didn't shake it up, as they did on the song ""Thank You."" The harmonies are right on key, and it's probably one of the best songs on the album. Because of their harmonies, it's hard not to agree when the old boybands of the late 90s would name Boyz II Men as one of their influences. It also shows that they're not exactly young anymore. The name was a symbol, of course. No longer are they boys, but they're men.

I'm sorry. I had to sneak that part in. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Thank You,"" ""Vibin,'"" ""I'll Make Love to You,"" ""On Bended Knee,"" ""50 Candles,"" ""Water Runs Dry""

<b>Did you know?:</b> That Michael McCary isn't in the group anymore? He didn't have that cane for nothing, to be honest. It sucks, if I may be frank. It's a little weird seeing them all be a threesome, instead of four. Sigh."

"event","That's right: underneath my cool exterior, beautiful face, young body, and all that other crap I want you to believe ... I'm still a Britney Spears fan. Not as hardcore as some, not one to just push her aside, either. At the end of the day, I still have Britney Spears albums in my collection. And that's how it'll probably be for the rest of my life.

I waited about 2+ years to buy <i>Britney</i>, mainly because I like to wait for CDs to go on sale now, especially if I missed the initial ""sale"" price when it first came out. The Virgin Megastore is good at having their 10 dollar sales, and every time there was one, I searched high and low for this album. Alas, it was still regular price, and I wasn't going to be the sucker who was going to buy it at that time. And so, last week, my dream came true, as I saw it sitting in the 10 dollar section, waiting for me. Calling out my name. And so, I bought it. My collection is semi-complete, as I do not have <i>In the Zone</i>. I expect this will happen the same exact way, me waiting until it's on sale-sale. 

While listening to <i>Britney</i>, it occurred to me that most of these songs were from her movie, <u>Crossroads</u>, which I saw a couple of months ago. How glad am I that I saw it on cable? Pretty damn glad. It also didn't occur to me that I would remember the songs, and be excited every time they came up while playing the album. Whaaat? That's right. I like this album. Why? Because:

- it doesn't have too much of the stupid, bubble gum-esque songs on <i>...Baby One More Time</i>. For example, listen to ""Email My Heart"" or even ""Soda Pop."" Yuck. 
- there aren't too many fast-paced songs like there was on <i>Oops! ... I Did It Again</i>. It also doesn't have THAT stupid ass title. Ugh. 
- The album has some songs by The Neptunes. Is there anything Chad and Pharrell can't do?

Those are the main reasons that this album is pretty cool to me, but basically, I just like this album because it feels ... right. Right this time, anyway. Britney also co-wrote a couple of the songs, so that's pretty cool, don't you think? With this album, she basically came a long damn way from the first one. And you can tell, as stupid as it really sounds. Who'd expect Britney to put out a more ""mature"" album. I haven't really heard too much of <i>In the Zone</i>, but I hear it's a step up from this one as well. 

<b>Key Track(s):</b> ""I'm a Slave 4 u,"" ""Overprotected,"" ""I'm not a girl, not yet a woman,"" ""boys,"" ""That's Where You Take Me""

<b>Remake that surprisingly isn't too bad:</b> ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll""

<b>Song that I didn't realize was a ""duet"":</b> ""What it's like to be Me"" ... comone. Don't tell me you don't hear Timberlake in the background? The song isn't too bad either. He even does the beatbox shit. Ha."

"event","I keep hearing the term ""rock opera"" when this album is described. What, perchance, is a rock opera? I suppose it's when a rock/punk/whatever group decides to put out an ambitious album, succeeds, and gets their message across in a long ... opera. Of a sort. Get what I mean?

So, that's when this album, ""American Idiot"" comes into play. Not only is it probably one of the best Green Day albums in the history of the group, but it probably <i>is</i> the best album they ever put out. It rivals ""Dookie,"" but only because that album was their so-called breakthrough album. ""American Idiot"" is also a breakthrough, so I suppose that makes it in the same category. 

Once upon a time, groups put out what they called <i>concept albums</i>. Meaning ... there was a meaning behind it all. The most you hear it associated with is The Beatles, mainly because they liked to dress themselves up in bright suits once in a while. But, if there had to be a concept album of our time, my time, the time now, it has to be ""American Idiot."" Mainly because the attempts  by the latter weren't all that interesting *ahem, NSYNC*. 

Another thing about concept albums are the social commentary. The Beatles did a lot with that, and if you listen to ""American Idiot,"" you hear a lot about that too. Green Day started their social commentary on ""Warning:"" and used it to a T with this album. 

<i>Who is the American Idiot?</i> I'll let you take a guess, then just say that it's probably Bush. Or, hell ... it could be anybody you want it to be. One of those callouts to the sellouts all around us. Besides the American Idiot, you've got other characters like St. Jimmy, even Whatsername ... and the one character you've probably heard about: Jesus of Suburbia. His song carries on in chapters alike. 

Instead of giving you the rundown of what this album means and how much it means, I'm just going to say you need to listen to it yourself. Maybe it's being overhyped and blown out of proportion, especially for a Green Day album. I figure if it's getting this much praise, it's because it's actually <i>that good</i>. But, of course, I'll leave it up to you to draw your own conclusions. But in my opinion, it's one of the best of the year. And I don't really put that kind of label on albums. Ever. 

<b>Key Track(s):</b> ""American Idiot,"" ""Jesus of Suburbia,"" ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"" ""She's a Rebel,"" ""Letterbomb,"" ""Wake Me When September Ends,"" ""Homecoming,"" ""Whatsername""

<b>Best Lyric:</b> ""Everyone is so full of shit/ born and raised by hypocrites/ hearts recycled but never saved/ from the cradle to the grave/ we are the kids of war and peace/ from Anaheim to the Middle East/ We are the stories and disciples of the Jesus of Suburbia/ land of make believe/ and it don't believe in me/ and I don't care"" - from Jesus of Suburbia: I Don't Care

<b>Most Depressing Song:</b> ""Wake Me Up When September Ends""

<b>Reminiscent of <i>Dookie</i>:</b> The lyrics printed in the booklet are written out, not typed. But, there are no pictures to go along with it."

"event","What better way to celebrate the holiday season than with some good ol' fashioned Christmas music?

That's why, when I want a jolly good time, I usually pop in ""Snowed In"" by those loveable Hanson brothers. Like most fans, I was a teenie bopper and pretty much obsessed. I think the Christmas album is usually a sign of the times ... when you put one out, you're usually at your prime. The Beatles put one out. So did Christina Aguilera. *NSYNC ... 98* degrees ...New Kids on the Block ... and so forth. The Christmas album just means that you're good enough to put one out. Or at least popular enough. 

""Snowed In"" is pretty much your run-of-the-mill Xmas album, except for the fact that it's <i>good</i>. There are a couple of remakes like ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" and ""What Christmas Means to Me."" Then you have the original songs done by Hanson, which are ""At Christmas,"" ""Christmas Time,"" and ""Everybody Knows the Clause."" Then there's a whole bunch of other holiday fun! 

The album came out right after ""Middle of Nowhere,"" so the vocals on this album are still pretty young. I suppose that's why the album works. Everyone isn't too deep-voiced (except for Isaac, whom I think was born sounding the way he does, hee hee), and it gives the album a punchy, upbeat mood. A whole bunch of kids having fun, basically. What's a little crazy is that they were pretty young when they did this album, and I'm putting it up there with the classic Christmas albums. Sort of reminds me of the Jackson 5 Christmas Album. That was a pretty good one, too. 

The album also shows their appreciation of music from the past. Remaking some old ones, writing some new. They didn't do any half assed versions of the classics, and if you need proof, listen to ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" and even ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)."" ""At Christmas"" is a bit of a slow one, but I have to say: it's pretty damn good. Hanson has always had the ability to create great music. It's a mix of old and new. Who doesn't like that?

Besides old school Hanson fans like myself, this album would be a good play for some kids. And hell, even in your local American Eagle Outfitters store. Ha. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Merry Christmas, Baby,"" ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),"" ""At Christmas,"" ""Everybody Knows the Claus,"" ""Silent Night Medley""

<b>Did You Know?</b> There was a Christmas special that aired on ABC when this album came out? Yes. I know this because I'm lame. And also because I taped it. And I liked it.

<b>In 1997...</b> I was 15 years old, and a sophomore in high school. My favorite bands were *NSYNC and Hanson. And my favorite singers were Aaliyah and Brandy. I was also fat."

2) At one time, I wanted to marry Donnie. Then Jordan. Then Joe.
3) I haven't listened to Step By Step in its entirety. EVER.

That's like, punishment by public beating by New Kids on the Block fans, I think. That last one, anyway. At one time, I did listen to the album, the whole thing. But it was either in the background or I was on the phone tuning it out here and there(and yes ... when I was seven years old).

And now, in my wise old age of 22, I can say now that I have listened to the whole album. I mean, really <i>listened</i> to it. And this is my shpiel:

This is probably the best NKOTB album. EVER. Maybe I'm just biased, but some of these songs don't even sound like New Kids! Okay, so ""Step by Step,"" the title track is a bit on the cheesy side, and so is ""Tonight"" ... but have you listened to that song? It reminds me of ... *gulp* The Beatles. That's not even a funny comparison, but I'm being serious. The chorus, it just screams to me some crazy Magical Mystery stuff. ""Baby I Believe In You"" is another song that doesn't even sound like New Kids. First of all, I dig the porno-intro. And then there's this saxophone solo during the last part of the song. I don't know how to describe it. 

The album is definitely a 90s album. Those beats, man. People went crazy with synthesizers and shit. Man. I just can't get over this album! Why was I a moron when I was younger? I think I like this album better than ""Hangin' Tough,"" and believe me ... I am in LOVE with that album. This was probably NKOTB's more ""grown up"" album, besides ""Face the Music."" This is the first ""grown up"" one, anyway. 

I can't put my finger on it, but I'm digging this album. I'm not even going to try and put it eloquently, or make this sound like a lost review from some music magazine. Plain and simple: I am digging this album. Digging it like .... diggers do! It's the ultimate teeny bopper album. <i>Ever</i>.

The CD sleeve is a bit aged, but it still looks pretty good. I found maybe one or two of those old paper spots. And the staples look a bit rusty.

We used the light from a flickering candle across the room.
To make the kind of shadows that only one thing could make ...
Love.</i>
- from ""morning,"" track 1

That opening track sets the tone for <i>janet.,</i> perhaps Janet Jackson's most famous album (and probably most famous album cover). It's one of my favorites, mainly because I listened to it over and over again. 

They called it the soundtrack of summer, from what I remember in the early 90s. I was still a young buck, of course, but I did know what love was from her album. It was kind of silly, yet, kind of understandable. I think from this album, everyone knew what love was from Janet's point of view. 

Comprised of love songs and ""you did me wrong"" types, there isn't much of a lull in the album. She does give herself a sort of <i>Rhythm Nation</i> redux with the track ""new agenda,"" which centers on the fact that as a woman she's trying on a couple of new roles, such as being a strong woman. Even though it's kind of a weird addition to most of the love songs, slow and fast, it still fits. It's Janet Jackson for the love of all that is holy, anyway. 

Most people who just put out an album like this probably couldn't get away with it like Janet did. Her voice is soft and enticing, yet it can be pushy at the same time. My backup for that? The song ""If."" It's one of the best songs Janet Jackson has ever done and without a doubt, people still go crazy when she does it in concert. In short, the album is sexified. The slow, the fast, the in between. 

It's been a while since I've listened to this CD, mainly because I didn't have my own copy (the one I had was my sisters before she moved). Of course, all of the classic CDs seem to go on sale in later years, and of course, this was a must-buy. But listening to it automatically brings up certain memories, both good and bad. Weird, too. And of course, I have nothing buy praise for this album ... so it's hard to maybe pick out any bad things. Or maybe just one ... maybe the whole obsession that Mariah Carey had with remixing her songs came about with this, but ... they made a remix of ""Anytime, Anyplace"" (done beautifully by R. Kelly), but it's not available on this album. On the album, it's seven minutes long, and doesn't have the same beat that people are probably more familiar with. It sucks that it's not on the original. But you can either download it (I think?) or buy the Janet Remix album, which I do have, just to hear it.

I figure if you're looking for classic Janet Jackson, this is the first CD you buy besides <i>Control</i> and <i>Rhythm Nation 1814</i>. And of course, my favorite album of all time, <i>The Velvet Rope.</i> But that's another review in itself.


<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""that's the way love goes,"" ""you want this,"" ""if,"" ""because of love,"" ""again,"" ""where are you now?"" ""anytime, anyplace,"" ""the body that loves you."" (and ... the hidden track, after #27)

"event","Okay. So I thought I couldn't get anymore pathetic when I bought some of those <i>Songs from Dawson's Creek</i> compilation soundtracks. But then again, tomorrow and the next are always a new day. Wouldn't you say?

However, I've grown out of feeling like a loser and decided that buying these kind of CDs aren't a sign of the end of the world. You know how you hear a song on a show these days now, probably on the WB or something, and you're like, ""I want that song!"" Well. Those head honchos who work at the networks give you that chance.

Which is what I got when I bought ""The OC, Mix 1"" CD a while back. ""The OC"" has become one of my favorite TV shows in the past year, mainly because it reminds me of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" and ""Dawson's Creek."" There seems to be always the same characters in the shows, too. Brandon is now in the form of Ryan Atwood. Pacey is probably Seth reincarnated (but not too much ... Pacey was a dimwitt in some sense). The Starved skinny girl with a drinking problem crown has been passed from Kelly to Marissa. It's a perfect concoction! 

But anyway, what is this? A music review or TV show review? I'm a TV whore. 

Besides that ... I think the major improvement in shows like these are that they feature some kickass music. I suppose it all started with ""Dawson's"" since they were the probably the first to feature songs in their shows, then kind of give a plug at the end. And now, it's all the rage among all these types of shows. I think that one of the many strengths of ""The OC"" is that they use music to move the show forward, and give it a sense of tone. Of course, that's what music does in something like this, anyway. It also gives them a kick back vibe, as they're supposed to be in Newport Beach.

Most of the ""Mix 1"" CD are songs that OC fans would probably recognize ... the song that played when Ryan was leaving Newport, and so forth. A lot of the songs featured are by virtually unknown artists. But then again, after their songs would appear on ""The OC""  their sales (and cred) would go up. If you remember when Rooney appeared on the show, their sales immediately went up after they provided the entertainment for an episode. Other artists like Jet and Jem are now known because of the show. 

But if you don't watch ""The OC"" the CD is still enjoyable. It's that kind of music that you could probably listen to if you were a) a character on a WB teen drama, b) on a road trip, or c) really into some upbeat (or maybe downbeat), easy to listen to catchy tunes. It also helps if you're in sunny California. But I figure listening to it anywhere would probably give it the same effect. 

And of course, what would this CD be without the theme song they got from Phantom Planet titled, ""California,"" which basically kicks off the show every week? I think it's mandatory to have the themesong on the soundtrack. And also, at the end of the CD to close it out. ""I Don't Wanna Wait"" is the last track on the ""Dawson's"" first soundtrack.

"event","It's not everyday that punk grows up. Whatever the hell that means, I'm not sure. I hear it a lot when I read reviews of CDs sometimes. They've been using it on Green Day a lot ... I guess that's what happens when the same acts start to do something different with themselves.

Which, of course, isn't any different from what Good Charlotte has done on their latest, ""The Chronicles of Life and Death."" The vocals are the same with Joel and Benji Madden. They have the same exact voice except maybe Benji has an octave lower or two. The lyrics, still creative and jumpy as they've always been. However, the only difference with this album is that it's probably a far stretch from their first self-titled and the breakout ""The Young and the Hopeless."" 

I'll say that they've definitely grown as musicians. But don't all musicians go through that at some point? I can't say ""It's about time"" because that'd be kind of shady. 

""Chronicles"" still has the catchy tunes, yet it seems as though they've infused some kind of New Wave beats in between. Hell, they infused a lot of new things. 

I don't think Good Charlotte has been too ""serious"" with most of their songs, except maybe on ""The Young and the Hopeless"" where they sung openly about family matters and so forth. I think the difference between this album and the latter is that there are more power ballads, as I like to call them. Between this and the other two albums, this one is the more serious of the bunch. Not too many jumpy ""catchy"" tunes, but more of those ""tunes from the heart"" complete with guitar riffs and piano breaks. And don't forget the synthesizers.

All right: so I'll stop trying to be ""music critic"" of the year for the moment. <b>I love this album.</b> One of the best of the year. Many of ""my fellow critics"" aren't big fans of this album. They're too used to hearing ""good charlotte"" (jumpy, poppy-punk) as opposed to ""Good Charlotte"" (more ""mature"" and insightful shit). When people think of the band, they think ""just another one of those bands."" It's true: they <i>are</i> just another one of those bands, but you gotta give them credit for at least trying to do something different. In my opinion, they have succeeded. As musicians, they have grown into something more. It's not just the instruments they use but it's also the lyrics. Sure they'll still be critical of some things, make fun of them too ... but the best music really comes from the heart and things you experience. Those are the things that really make the man. Or band. And to be able to convey those feelings, that music is something all in itself. 

Hey, at least they had the guts to go out and do something different. Those who try usually just sound the same to me, really. But as far as personal feelings go about this album, or any of Good Charlotte's albums ... they sure know how to get you through the tough times.

"event","At some point in time, I usually do the unthinkable without really noticing. Even if someone <i>is</i> my favorite artist in the world, I somehow forget that they exist. I'll still have their CD, it'll still be on my desk or somewhere around where I can find it. But I'll just leave it there until maybe I come across it and figure that I miss it more than I know. 

So, in goes the CD and I listen to it and all these weird memories flow through me, different moods like to flow as well. You know how it goes. 

For a while, all I used to listen to every single night was everything---or, anything Jason Mraz. I somehow come running back to him. It's not that I want to leave, but ... things get in the way. I somehow come crawling back. 

Maybe because his music brings me pleasure, it brings me calm, it brings me to a better place than I feel like I'm in. 

With his latest album, which is a live recording of his performance in Milwaukee (I believe? People started screaming when he said ""Milwaukee"" in one of his songs. Yeah, okay.), there's no change in the mood he puts me in. Not only is this a live recording, but damnit, it has a complimentary DVD that comes with it! Same concert and a whole lot of goodies. I haven't had a chance to really watch the DVD, but I'll probably tack on a special section to this review later. 

Now, I guess I'm pretty much biased as a Mraz fan, mainly because I love him. So I won't really say anything bad about the album, or let alone anything critical. Just because I don't find anything really bad to criticize him for. In my eyes, he can do no wrong. I've been to his concert and damnit, this man can put on a show. And by the sound of the crowd ... he basically did the same show I was at, and people reacted the same way they did at my show. Except John Popper didn't come out during ""Curbside Prophet."" That would have been sick, yo. < / end of the slang talk. >

With Toca in toe (heh.), it sounds like Mraz and the rest of the band have a great grasp on the music, the concepts ... the mood. Mraz & team sure know how to put a mood on the crowd. One minute, he can be introducing his music with ""Tonight, Not Again"" (one of my least favorite tracks, to be honest) all slow and steady, and the next he could be tuning the crowd with ""No Doubling Back"" or even ""Unfold."" 

Perhaps the best songs on the album are those he never released commercially. Come on, when <i>are</i> the best songs released recorded in the studio? For those who only have the album <i>Waiting for my Rocket to Come</i> ... you are missing OUT! Those are only SOME of his great songs. You should be picking up <i>Live At Java Joe's</i>, or heck, even get yourself a bootleg copy of his concert. He <i>encourages</i> it, from what I remember. There's even a site out there where you can get it for free and burn it onto a CD. This man built his career on doing live shows. And to me, they're the best ones. 

The songs that you've probably never heard are ones like ""1,000 Things"" which, is probably my most favorite of Mraz tracks---about the general things I'm a sucker for (like love at first sight). Or even ""Sleeping to Dream,"" which is my second most favorite---living without someone can be painful, but dreaming can make it a little better. Hmm ... ""After an Afternoon,"" ""Common Pleasure,"" ... the list goes on. 

So, in conclusion? One of the best Live CDs I've ever heard in my life. Maybe even Mraz's best. Lyric-wise, Mraz is strong in that department, and as for him and Toca and the rest of the band, there's a lot going on there as well. There's a lot about Jason Mraz that I'd like to keep saying, but if I kept on saying it you'd get tired of reading <i>the whole thing.</i> 

<b>Favorite Tracks:</b> I liked everything, of course. 

<b>Best live track performed from <i>Waiting for my Rocket to Come</i>:</b> ""No Stopping Us (Live Version)""

<b>Weather conditions that help enhance the Mraz experience:</b> warm, sunny days. 

<b>Best love song:</b> A tie: ""1,000 Things"" and ""Sleeping to Dream"""

"event","John Mayer actually had an album before he released his <i>breakthrough</i> album, ""Room for Squares."" Actually, ""Room for Squares"" basically stems from ""Inside Wants Out,"" mainly because four of the songs are on ""Room for Squares.""

So what's the difference? Everything is pretty much dumbed down, less ... studio-esque? I figure that's the way to describe it. Let's just say there isn't much production on the track ""Neon,"" which is my least favorite on ""Room for Squares."" But when I listen to it stripped of the production qualities that I feel crowd the song entirely ... it's actually my favorite on this one. Because it sounds so raw, if I do say so myself. 

Most of ""Inside Wants Out"" is slow, comfortable and whatever else that will make you relaxed. Most of what John Mayer does in his songs is write about love, stupid things he's done, things he's learned, things he misses ... I guess I can basically identify with the certain themes he writes about in every single song. 

Also, most of the tracks feature him and his guitar---how all singer/songwriters basically do their music. One instrument, one voice. Simple as that. I like this album because it's simple. If I don't feel like listening to the most ""upbeat, pop-like"" sounds of ""Room for Squares,"" I always turn to ""Inside Wants Out."" I still get John Mayer either way. And, it's one of the albums that usually relaxes me enough to put my insomniac ass to sleep most of the time. 

And, this may be a sidenote, but I really like John Mayer's style. Something about him reminds me of the quiet guy that you secretly thought was really hot in high school. Everyone thought he was kind of weird, but still nice. Kind of a loner, doing his own thing. He was that guy that the teacher stuck you with when you had to have a partner for a history project or something, and you were reluctant because of the things you heard about him. You somehow end up at his house to work on the project and when you go into his room you see a guitar in the corner and a poster of The Beatles on the wall. And sooner or later as you discover each other's ""secret lives"" you like what you see. And you no longer find him weird, and he no longer thinks of you some kind of entity yourself. 

I guess I can describe my like for John Mayer that way. When I first listened to ""Room for Squares,"" I loved it; it was a complete surprise. And when I thought that ""Heavier Things"" was the next best thing, I discovered yet another part of him (""Inside Wants Out"") that I never knew. And I loved it anyway.

<b>Key Track(s):</b> All of them. 

<b>Favorite Track(s):</b> ""Neon,"" ""Love Soon""

<b>Best Lyric:</b> ""Me and my TV screen /The volume's down /Blue lights are dancing around /And still /I can't seem to find /The quiet inside my mind"" - from ""Quiet"""

"event","""In Search of ... "" was possibly one of 2001's masterpieces. It had everything that nobody could imagine ... drum beats, guitar riffs, and Pharrell Williams --- his ""crooner"" voice, anyway. It was a combination of things that nobody would ever expect.

Cut to 2004, almost three years after N*E*R*D's breakout first album. Their second album, ""Fly or Die,"" I feel isn't exactly in the same category as ""In Search of ..."" which I admit is one of my favorite albums of all time. N*E*R*D still has the same basic formula--live band, live everything. No Spymob of course, but they still find the time to back them up on tour or whenever they're on TV. 

As a N*E*R*D fan, I figure that I have a lot of ... background on the subject of this group, mainly because I love them so. Only I feel that it would be right for me to give it a critique, and not leave it to the heavyweights of record reviews I see on internet magazines and your music magazines like <u>Blender</u> or whatever. Only a fan such as I can do it the right kind of justice. 

I guess it just makes me ill to see when reviewers give it three stars instead of four, or even five. So what can I do? I'll give it five. 

Like I said before, the formula is basically the same, except they have different songs. I think with ""In Search of..."" there was more of ... ""poor boy"" theme. Shit about dealing drugs, having sex, trying to get by and all that shit. On ""Fly or Die,"" perhaps all of those concepts are still around but they're <i>disguised</i> better. Or maybe even written/sung about differently. 

I read almost all of the reviews written about ""Fly or Die"" and people keep saying that N*E*R*D reminds them of the bands from the 70s ... the songs are a reminder of the kind of music that was around most of the decade. The beats, the way Pharrell goes ""Ooooo...""  I think it has that kind of a feel as well. 

A lot of what I like about N*E*R*D and their music is that they write about things I can identify with. Okay, so I don't identify with dealing drugs or anything like that. But there's so much about the group that can represent me in a sense. I wish they came out with a song like ""Breakout"" when I was still 11 years old. The song is like a love letter to people who feel like they have nobody to hold onto, feeling as if their lives are nothing. ""Shit happens/just blow it off/woooooooo...."" If only I'd heard that, I probably wouldn't be such a pushover in adulthood.

The psychedelic ""Wonderful Place"" is something I can listen to while trying to get to bed, of course. It brings me to yet another place, and even the hidden track after it does. Anyway, if there's a song that'll take you back a couple of decades, this song definitely will. It'll remind you to look around at the beauty in the world, even though you might not have the time. And even if you're looking at something like a rock. 

It wouldn't be a review without mentioning their first single, ""She Wants to Move,"" which reminds me of those guys in the club that try to stick to one chick, and she wants to usually move around. But the guy usually tries to keep claiming her until someone pries her away. It's funny to see. I love the drumbeats in this song, especially when Shay goes ""Base"" and it shows up on cue. Or is it Pharrell who says it? Anyway, this is definitely a club song, after they mix it with a bunch of crap that just makes it weird sounding.

I like the combination of The Neptunes plus one guy that nobody really knows (Shay, to those who don't know his name). It's kind of crazy how they can go under a different name and make completely different music from what's expected. I suppose it's like when actors like to take their careers in a different direction, like going from playing a nice guy to a rapist. Except, N*E*R*D can make the transition so easily. Sometimes, it's not successful for most people. But I think with the combination of Pharrell and his ""superstardom-ness,"" Chad and his brilliance, and Shay and his ability to make it work ... they've got something great. 

In the future, I'd kind of like to see N*E*R*D take their careers in a different direction. Or not their careers, but their music. Not that I'm complaining about what they do now, but it'd be really exciting to see what they come up with next. With the success of ""In Search Of..."" I think N*E*R*D was able to do whatever they wanted with ""Fly or Die."" They did, and whatever they did ... they need to keep doing it. I can't wait to see what's coming up in the future.

"event","I probably could have picked a ""better choice"" for the second installment of this thing. But I'm listening to it right now, and it's what you get! Plus, it's a part of my collection.

----


There are probably many people out there who would agree that Clay Aiken sure has one powerful set of pipes. With his album, ""Measure of a Man"" it's no doubt that he has an incredible gift. 

Except ... there's something about his songs that might be a little ... iffy. There are the pop hits like ""Invisible,"" and the song he sung on the American Idol finale ""This is the Night."" Then there are the adult contemporary songs like ... every single song on the album. 

Let's face it: Aiken has the makings of a Manilow for the new millenium. A Manilow for the Generation X crowd. Or, would you even address us 20-somethings and under as Generation X? Let's just say, Aiken is our Manilow. 

But, I wouldn't do him any justice if that's all I called Aiken. This kid can <i>sing</i>. A few of his songs are pretty cheesy, maybe even border on creepy (I'm talking about ""Invisible"" ... just listen to what he says). There are a few that I could probably do without, or maybe just one. I'll take this opportunity to name it: ""When You Say You Love Me."" It's a horrible, horrible song. A song I'd hear in a country western bar/saloon, where all the guys wear flannel and do square dancing. Where's there's hay on the ground and a cheesy looking jukebox, where the guy behind the bar's name is Joe. That's not what you're supposed to picture when you think ""American Idol."" 

But then again ... Aiken isn't really the American Idol, so maybe he can get away with horrible songs like that. 

Aiken has his moments on the record. He already had a hit, which was ""Invisible"" with that video that had nothing to do with  the song (thank goodness). ""The Way"" was weird because ... the video was weird. But the song is lovely like those cheesy love songs. ""This is the Night"" reminds me of American Idol so much that I feel it to be a guilty pleasure, no matter how much the cheese overfloweth. Then, there are the ""anthems"" or declarations if you must give them a name. ""Perfect Day"" is a fine example about loving somebody and feeling that everything is complete. And I think the song besides the others I really like is ""Measure of a Man."" Probably the best love song on the album ... well, I'll call it a love song. 

Okay. So I know that Aiken isn't for everybody, that I know for sure. But if you like adult contemporary-ish songs that you'd probably be reminded of blokes like Manilow and Richard Marx ... then this album is for you. Enjoyable on different levels. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Invisible,"" ""The Way,"" ""No More Sad Songs,"" ""I Survived You,"" ""This is the Night,"" ""Perfect Day,"" ""Measure of a Man,"" ""Touch."""

"event","So far, the last album put out by mega-group *NSYNC. It's been a while since I've had a dose of this, so here's my best. 

The first time I heard this album I was probably still fresh in college. A freshman. I bought it because at the time I was the biggest *NSYNC fan alive. I doubt I'm the biggest. Maybe the weirdest. But I still love them of course. This was supposed to be their ""concept album"" like how groups used to make in the old days. They even have a ""celebrity"" themed cover - while walking down the red carpet, guarded by their real-life bodyguards at the time amidst adoring fans. I wonder if it's still that way for them? 

The album first starts out with ""Pop,"" which was their first single from the album. I heard it was first titled ""dirty pop"" but instead, that became their type of genre. Trying to get away from the Swedish sound-factory produced kind of pop, they dubbed their music ""dirty pop."" [ / end lecture from an old *NSYNC fan ] 

There was a small amount of songs I found myself liking on this album. That sounds horrible coming from me, but it's sadly true. There were songs I could have done without, like their throwback to the Swedish sound that surprisingly I <i>hated</i> (""Just Don't Tell Me That""). And even their title track was something I could have done without. 

Most of the good songs came from the so-called two ""superstars"" of the group. JC shows his growth as a lyric writer and even collaborator. There were in fact, many collaborators on this album including Riprock n' AG, The Neptunes, Wade J. Robson, and even the old skool folk like Max Martin (to name a few). Perhaps the best collaboration comes with The Neptunes and their influence on the crossover hit ""Girlfriend."" It even had a kickass remix, if you want me to be honest. 

I say it's a crossover hit because I heard it on my Top 40 Urban radio station. Never, in all of my years in hearing *NSYNC had I <i>ever</i> heard them on that station. I had to turn to my teenie bopper influenced Top 40 Pop radio station which unsurprisingly disappeared one sunny afternoon. I figure this kind of gave Justin Timberlake a segue into ""I'm Michael Jackson"" land. 

Besides that collaboration, I suppose the next best one is ""Up Against The Wall,"" a JC and Riprock n' AG work of art. I'm surprised this doesn't play in the clubs more often. 

Slow songs. *NSYNC always has to have slow songs. The best one has to be ""Gone"" of course. Written by Timberlake and his boyfriend Wade, it was really inspired by Timberlake's little idea that maybe one day his girlfriend and him would break up. And he wrote about it. Funny how it came true later on. But still, it made for some good drama. And good sales. Anyway, the next best slow song is ""Selfish,"" which used to put me on the brink of sobbing. But it never happened. I'm not that weird. 

I said something about ""Girlfriend"" being a crossover hit. I think it would be safe to say that this album was *NSYNC's crossover into <i>everything.</i> There's a little bit a ""dirty"" pop, a bit R&B, a bit of techno, a bit of old skool Swedish pop to keep the old fans satisfied. There's a broad range of everything in this album. I figure they were trying to do a whole lot of things at one time. 

So. Basic thoughts? Not exactly my favorite *NSYNC album, but still a pretty much enjoyable album. I'm kind of itching for a new one, even though I know it will probably take another year or two. Or until Timberlake's head deflates. 

<b>Key Tracks:</b> ""Pop,"" ""The Two of Us,"" ""Girlfriend,"" ""Gone,"" ""Up Against the Wall,"" ""Selfish,"" ""Do Your Thing."""

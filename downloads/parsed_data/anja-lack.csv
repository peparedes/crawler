"event","Do you ever wish you could get enough courage to harm yourself bad enough that it would put you in the hospital? That's how I feel now. Just push the knife in hard enough to make me bleed. Why can't I? I'm hurt, angry, depressed, frusterated, tired, and I just want it to end but for some reason I can't seem to do it. I feel the pain and I don't like it but I have some much of this other pain built up inside and I just want it out. How do I go about expressing it? I feel so lost. Who am I? I don't know anymore. I've lost myself in hell or as other people call it life. Everyone says life is what you make it, but how do you make it something. Everytime I try to be happy I get let down and crushed by the one person that's suposed to care about me. Does he? I don't know? It seems like I'm just there to be a step stool. He gets what he wants and I have to beg and plead for him to do anything for me. Why do I let myself get drug down in his stupid BITCH of a mothers world because that's what world he still in. Just because mommy did everything for him does not mean that I am going to anything for him. I fucking hate this life and it's all my fault that it turned out this way. If anyone in this world could die right at this moment first it would be Linda then it would be me. Nancy I miss you:("

"event","The Holidays went fine. We didn't have to see Ian's stupid family and we got back home (at school). Everything was OK. Well, my father called and told me that Leah had stopped by his house and wanted me to call her. Now tell me why in the world I would want anything to do with someone who exchanged nude photos of each other with my husband. The fact that I even had to hear anything about her just pisses me off. It's taken me so long to get over everything that happened back then and all of a sudden I get it thrown back in my face, by my own father. The last thing I told her was that I wanted nothing to do with her. I hate what she did and I hate everything that she's about. I haven't had dreams like the ones I've been having in a long time. How can one person's name bring that much hurt back into my life? I just want her to go away and never talk to Ian or I again. I want these dreams to stop and I want these feelings to go away. If anyone ever sees her tell her to go fuck herself and leave me the hell alone!"

"event","Yeah I know it's been a long time since I have wrote in here. Haven't really wanted to cause what I had to day was just down right mean. School's going really good. I like it a lot. I really should be working on my huge papers that are due next week. I really don't want to. I know, I know I have to and the sooner I do then they'll be done. Ok, so I'm really going to go do something else do I don't have to work on them."

"event","i can't believe what happened last night. all i wanted was a simple i'm sorry for the way that i treated you. all i got was a huge embarrassing fight infront of everyone at the coffee place. why is this happening? what did i do to deserve it? all i want now is to have nothing, and i mean nothing to do with her. i'm sorry but she crossed the line this time. you can't sit there and say that to someone that it's their fault that their kids turned out the way they did (especially when it's ment in a really shitty way). and you dont' say that someone iss a horrible mother. and you can't even bring up the fact that there have been two suicides in my mom's family to cut someone down like that. that's fucking bullshit. i hate it! i just want nothing more than to not have any contact with her ever again. she definatly won't be at the wedding. and i may get a personal protection order on her so i dont' have to worry about it. i still can't believe this all happened. it did. i want it to stop. the only way that it will in my opinion is if i do get the ppo on her. but on the reverse side i feel bad because it is ian's mom and i feel like i'm forcing him into a shitty position. i almost feel like it's my fault that all this shit ever happened in the first place. i know deep down that it's not but i can't deal with this anymore. in the words of my father, "" no one should ever have t o deal with this""..."

"event","every time that i think it's getting better. somehow i seem to feel worse. sometimes i feel like i'm just someone that can be thrown around. am i the stupid one i don't know. is he telling the truth, i don't know. i want to believe him so much but all i do is feel even shittier than i did before. i just want to die sometimes. he makes me feel like it's my fault that all this is happening. like i need to just get over it. how can i? i don't know how? that's why i want to die. not because i really don't want him around or even that i want him to be perfect. i just don't want to feel like everything i say could flair up into this stupid thing. everytime i want to let go and try to i find something else. maybe i'm the one being stupid. maybe he is just talking as friends but it's so hard to know. god, i just wish could say i trust you and leave it at that. i need to talk to him. but everytime this shit happens he leaves which in turn makes me feel even more like it's my fault that i'm making him feeel like shit. ahhhhhhhh........why can't my brain just stop. it needs to stop. i wish it would. i don't say things like that to make him feel like shit because he's the only person in the world that i'd want to be with like that. i wish he could just talk to me. i want to feel like a person again, not something that he runs away from when he gets mad. i hate it. so yeah he left to go drive around (even though the roads are horrible) i don't get it. what did i do? i just opened my big damn mouth again. god, if i could just keep it shut. so do talk to him when he gets home or do i let him do whatever he wants i tried to get him to talk to me but he wouldn't. so i let him go even though it was the hardest thing i probably could have done. i'm trying. i really am. i wish he new that. i guess i haven't shown him that though. i wish he could know just how much i care and love him. i dont' know what to do anymore......"

"event","yeah so i go to mom's to get started on my wedding plans, ok fine. my sister in-law and my brother were there. my nephew fell or something so my sister in-law decides to say, ""JESUS CHRIST"". geez if my mom ever heard me say that in her house she would have my head on stick sitting in the living room for everyone to see. now that she has the same last name mom should as hell be able to tell her that she doesn't appreciate the use of god's name in vain. she always said that she couldn't say anything to her becasuse she wasn't her daughter. well now she technically is, so she can say something to her but does she, NO!!!

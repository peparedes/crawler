"event","So I just came across this website, which I won't give out, and it somewhat made me frustrated. It was about the death of a Boston Police Officer in Roslindale back when i was younger. He died in the line of duty when a bomb exploded. Now I'm not one to get up in arms about things I never experienced myself. But I've heard a bunch of stories, and it kills me inside each time I hear it. The man, whom is in jail for the death of the Police Officer, has a group who created a website to his innocence. Now I know they have absolute right to do that, but the reasons they give to his innocence is absolutely ludicrous. Just because said person did some volunteer work, or that he never physically hurt someone doesn't justify the fact that he could have done this. I mean, think of the most normal person you know, then think of them committing a crime. People can change their thinking in an instant. To be honest, it doesn't make sense to me, and from seeing and hearing all the facts that the BPD and the goverment found, and the conclusion they came too... I think this person got what they deserved."

"event","Good afternoon everyone! 

So I basically update this thing every few months now it seems like, but I guess sometimes it gives me something to do. So I guess I'll fill you in on the world of Skinni D.

Now most of you know that I've been working as a cadet in the Boston Police Department... well I may be joining the Boston Police Academy sooner than I thought. I have one more process to go through (Physical Fitness exam) and then I just wait to get the letter in the mail telling me when to start. How awesome is that!?! I'll finally be able to train to be a cop (something that I've wanted to be since I was a little kid.) I'll keep y'all updated on how everything goes.

I've also been hanging with the guys a lot down here near the south shore. Myself, Colin, Chris, Jon, Mike and Andy have been having a hell of a time the past few months. We've made a music video or two (Beastie Boys 'Paul Revere' and a mix up of random as things to the tune of Footloose.) And when we hang out, we all laugh a hell of&nbsp; a lot. One night i laughed so hard, i felt like i did over a thousand situps. It's a great time, except we're losing another member of our group of friends. Andy is moving to San Diego for a year (I believe). Jeremy already left last year and now Andy's going. Mike wants to go out there next summer, so that's gonna suck as well if it happens. Even my friend Lindsay is moving to Virginia. Seriously, everyone stop moving far away, it's killing me!

If we can get certain parts of our videos on youtube or on here, I'll post em. Then you'll laugh at me for being overly retarded. 

I've buying a lot of music and of course going to a concert or two and see a bunch of movies. I've seen TMNT, Zodiac, Grindhouse, Blades of Glory, Reign Over Me (ABSOLUTELY AMAZING), and finally Spiderman 3. Spiderman 3 rocked, if anyone says any different... well... they don't know what they are talking about.

That's all for now. Keep it real!"

"event","So it's been a hell of a long time since I've updated this thing. So I guess I can give it a quick blurb to appease the millions of readers who read this. (Well maybe like one if I'm lucky, but I digress...). <br /><br />I started my new job last Monday . It's pretty amazing. I work as a cadet in the Boston Police Department as a worker under the Deputy of Special Operations. What that means is that I get to work with all the motorcycle cops, bomb squad, gang unit, etc, etc. I also drive around the police cars all day, which is pretty freakin' awesome. When you drive behind someone in a cop car, you can see why people get nervous. Those cars are intimidating. Hopefully, I'll be going into the Academy in April... and if that happens, I will hopefully be a police officer by October. Life is going WAY to fast right now. I don't even have time to catch my breath, but it's totally worth it. Imagine me a police officer? I always thought I would be one as a kid, and to actually be <i>this</i> close to becoming one... it's just amazing how you can reach a goal if you try as hard as you can.<br /><br />Since the last time I've updated a hell of a lot has gone on. I'll bullet them right quick.<br /><ul><li>Christmas rocked - I love seeing my whole family, it's such a great time. And I got all 5 Rocky movies for Christmas. Yes! High five!<br /></li><li>I spent NYE with Kath at some party in Brockton which was awesome.</li><li>I started training and finished training for the Cadet Program, and now work in Spec. Ops. (see above)</li><li>I saw The Protector (I want to learn Muai Thai), Rocky Balboa (awesome!), Good Shepherd (awesome!), Epic Movie (fucking awful), Departed (freakin' amazing!) and went to Body Worlds 2 (an eye opening experience).</li><li>Seriously, never EVER see <i>Epic Movie</i>... it's not worth the film its made on.</li><li>Quietdrive, Thirty Seconds to Mars, and the ever popular Kath Riley mix ""Emotastic"" cd has been playing constantly in the Kia.</li><li>Can someone tell Fergie to not sing anymore, her songs are flippin' everywhere. I'm getting annoyed.</li><li>I love the ""Peyton Manning Face"". Watch any commercial (one of the 3423432423 he's in), you'll see it. It's so funny.</li></ul>This concludes the update. See you in a few months! (jk, i'll update more)."

"event","<p>Tonight I've been doing a lot of thinking. I'm not sure why I only do it on night's that I'm absolutely bored out of my mind, but hey, it gets me through the night. I have had a bunch of random ideas and thoughts in my head and I figured the best way would be to get em all out. Here we go.</p><ul><li>Has it ever occured to anyone else that there seems to be a bunch of know-it-all's running rampantly throughout our society? I mean, everyone has their own opinions, but there are some people that feel that they absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt know how something is and what it is supposed to be. This irks me a little bit. I feel as though our society is being diminished by these people. Maybe I'm off on this, and maybe I really am just a stupid kid. But I know that no matter what, I wouldn't force my opinons on things to someone else to show that I ""know"" something about it. I have my opinion, and broadcast it as I see fit, without malice or discontent. But I'm sure if we all stop and think of someone we know, or someone in the media or the rest of the world; that there is at least one person who believes that they are the people who believe they know everything about every topic. <font color=""#000080"">""Don't judge a man by his opinions, but what his opinions have made of him."" G. Lichtenberg</font><br /></li><li>I helped administer a Black Belt exam yesterday morning at my karate school. There were three people taking the test. A father and son duo and another teenager. Now when I got there, it was around 7:40 in the morning. The test started at 8:00 and went until roughly 10:30. Yeah, I know that's a long test... but it's a four week test so we have to make them somewhat long to get everything in. Now saying that, the two other teachers that were there to help were already there. One of the people taking the test, the teenager, showed up a little after I did, and then the final teacher. So we were sitting around and waiting for the other&nbsp;two to show up, and it was about 2 minutes before 8 am. We went up on the floor and I started the teen&nbsp;out working combonations&nbsp;and such going up and down the floor.&nbsp;The other two participants&nbsp;strolled in 25 minutes later and pretty much figured it was okay since they have been going there for years that&nbsp;they could be late. The owner of the school came over and said ""I'm sorry you are too late, you'll have to wait till next year."" Now to me, that's a legitmate statement. If you are late for your test, then you shouldn't be&nbsp;able to take it,&nbsp;which the next one is probably going&nbsp;to be around next year sometime. The guy was like ""okay&nbsp;whatever"" and sat there with his son and watched. The owner had to go over&nbsp;AGAIN and told him they couldn't stay to watch. So the&nbsp;father took his son and said ""make sure you cancel our memberships"" and left slamming the door. Seriously, you&nbsp;have&nbsp;known about this date for the test&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>3 MONTHS</strong>, how could you be late?&nbsp;To me, they obviously didn't want&nbsp;a black belt enough.&nbsp;Suffice to say, the kid who took the test was lost doing this alone. I'm not saying he failed, he actually did amazing and I believe he passed with&nbsp;flying colors. He expected not to be alone during the testing, but he was. You&nbsp;could tell once they left he&nbsp;got more and more nervous. But&nbsp;I'll be damned if he didn't recooperate and give it 110%&nbsp;the rest&nbsp;of the way. I just can't imagine&nbsp;being late for a test of such great importance. To each his&nbsp;own.&nbsp;<br /></li><li>I've now been denied for&nbsp;a few&nbsp;jobs now. The latest were one at the DA's office in Boston and one as a Child Protective Service Worker in Portsmouth, NH. I've applied to at least 15 jobs now. Still yet to hear&nbsp;from a few others though. The thing is, is well it's getting to me. I mean, I'm a hard working kid, who is wicked reliable. I'm an outgoing person who is community oriented through all of my experience thus far. I was a decent student who did a ton of extracurriculars at school. I consider myself a pretty good friend and someone who anyone can count on. Stating this, <strong><u>WHY THE HELL CAN'T I GET A JOB!?!</u></strong> I'm trying so hard and I'm getting no where. Maybe I'm not that person I just described in the sentences prior to this. I really hope I am, and will believe I am until the day I die. I just hope I am right. <br /></li><li>I feel very alone lately. I think it has to do with me not really having anyone around here to hang out with. I was EXTREMELY lucky this weekend to hang out with Kath and of course Derek/Lindsey/Amanda/Erin. I was going crazy just sitting in my house. I am outgoing, but there is really no one to meet thats new in my town. I know mostly all the people in my age range. My town is pretty small so it's not too hard to not notice new people. I just wish I had someone around that I could just go over their house and shoot the shit. I thought I had something like that until recently, which turned out a wash. I understand that college is over and that everyone's schedules are really different, but it sucks being the only one in a 20 mile radius that you know. Let me repeat that, the only one I know in a 20 mile radius that I see on&nbsp;a regular basis is myself. Sucks huh?<br /></li><li>The last and final dot. There's a line in a few country songs I hear all the time. Basically if you have to move back to move forward or move forward and end up going backwards. Here's the line I've been listening to a lot lately. ""<strong>Woke up this morning, the house was cold. Checked the furnace and she wasn't burning. Went out and hopped in my old Ford. Hit the engine but she ain't turning. Given each other some hard lessons lately, but we ain't learning. Same sad story that's a fact. One step and two steps back.""</strong> Now I'm not saying that I've had some hard times with anyone else. The way that I'm looking at that line is that, the way that things are going... I'm not moving forward at all. And the person that I've given hard lessons too lately has been myself. I try to catch myself with a bit of happiness and I always end up getting pushed back down, somehow, without hesitation. One step up, then two steps back. I need to start learning my lessons nowadays, maybe I'll be able to make it a few steps up with one step back, making it a positive action of moving forward. One can only dream.</li></ul><p><font color=""#000080"">Thanks for reading this non-sense.

"event","So I saw this thing on&nbsp; the inside of the new Sugarcult cd called ""Lights Out and Recurrent Love Themes"". It was a collage of lyrics from the cd and it looked awesome. Well, I thought I would give it a try with my poetry. Enjoy!<br /><br />""Silences and Shattered Love Stories""<br /><br /><em>Silence surrounds me. I lie awake at night, hearing the faint screams. I look up towards the sun and moon. I try to find you. Where imagination rules. The yearning&nbsp;from the inside - For the tenderness&nbsp;of your touch, sinks into the horizon. That beautiful shade of blue.&nbsp; Silence surrounds me. And like kamikazes they fall. A river trailing through my brow. The bed is still unmade on your side. The picture frames line the walls.&nbsp;Your voice still echoes, through the corners of my mind.&nbsp;I remember it like yesterday; eyes shut. Holding your hand as the sun sets. Stirring I awake - another bad dream. Screaming haunts my every thought, chaos controls my emotions. Hiding under the floorboards, you break through. Pacing back and forth I await your embrace. My hand outstretched to reach you. All I see is shadows around my room. You said you'd be here. I can't take this anymore. Silence surrounds me.</em>"

"event","I got down to thinking tonight about a bunch of random things. Mainly certain aspects of my life that somehow should be, well, different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I've led an amazing life thus far and I wouldn't trade any of it for the world. Okay, maybe one or two little mistakes I've made, but I digress. My life has been fantastic. But some things should and should have been different.<br /><br />The first thing that should be different is my choice of career. Sure I want to work in the Criminal Justice field. But I don't want to be your run of the mill cop, or someone who sits at a desk and writes reports. I want to be out there really helping people. Yes, I understand that cop's do help people. But a lot of people scrutinize those officers in certain situations. Let's go back a month or so ago. A man was being chased by the Boston Police through a certain section of&nbsp; Mattapan. There was one officer chasing on foot, the other went and called for backup. The suspect ran into a back yard where there was a BBQ going on, or some sort of party. The officer tackled the suspect in this party. Now, usually what occurs, is the officer may get some help from a good samaritan, maybe by calling the cops to tell them where this is going on, or help the cop with the suspect. But in this case, somewhat of the opposite happened. The people at this party threw cans full of soda/beer, keys and everything else AT the police officer. The suspect ended up getting away and someone at the party stole the cop's cell phone. Long story short, the cop got the guy again (mind you this cop is a rookie) and goes back and asks for his cell phone.&nbsp; Why in god's name would I want to work here, and be chastized by people for running someone down who committed a crime? I want to help people, not get the shit beat out of me when I'm trying to do that. Honestly, I wish I could work in the Special Victim's section of the law enforcement where the people I captured are the people we want to see in jail the most. The sexual offenders, the pedifiles, rapists, etc, etc. That would be a dream of mine.<br /><br />The second thing is, well, I wish I saved money over the years. Now I saw all the time that money is just an object, you aren't going to be buried with it, so why have it in the first place. And I'll live by that saying forever. But I've been foolish in spending my money. Seriously, what was I thinking? I should have at least saved for after college if I didn't find a job right away (I still haven't). My own foolish mistake. But I'll still spend the money I have, but only on myself and the people that I think deserve it most. And there's one person I can think of off the top of my head, but thats about it. You likve and learn I guess.<br /><br />Actually that's all I wish I would have changed or be different. I thought there was more, but I'm sure either some people would get really offended by things I would have changed, or just not give a shit. To be honest, I couldn't give a shit what people thought about me. As long as I am happy, and those around me are happy, who cares about their petty nonsense. Makes me think back to that time when everyone got along SO well, then one day, out of the clear blue, a ""big bang"" so to speak ravaged its way through my life. Distanced from some, apart from others. I kind of miss those days where things were calm and peaceful. But I guess I have to thank god that it happened, because if it hadn't, I wouldn't be the person that I am today. I'll end this wicked long (sorry) entry with this lyric from the song ""The Kill (Bury Me)"" by 30 Seconds to Mars...<br /><br /><font face=""Verdana""><font size=""2"">""I tried to be someone else<br />But nothing seemed to change<br />I know now, this is who I really am inside.<br />Finally found myself<br />Fighting for a chance.<br />I know now, this is who I really am.</font></font>"""

"event","I decided that I miss college a lot. <br /><br />And I've also decided that not having a job, really sucks as well. Granted I'm going through some hiring processes right now (BPD and Secret Service), I hate the fact that I don't have a lot of money to spend. I like having some cash, but I guess my life could be a hell of a lot worse.<br /><br />I saw on the news today that the British Government/Security foiled a terrorist plot to blow up some planes heading to the United States. Now I'm not one to complain about politics, but something HAS to be done. I understand that we are doing the best we can, but we can't just stop terrorism. That's like asking everyone to stop racial discrimination, it's always going to be there. Now I know I have my opinions and that everyone else has their own thoughts, but you know just as well as I do, is that something more could be done. I'm not saying bomb the hell out of Afghanistan/Iraq/where Al-Queda is. What I'm saying is that we need to look more indepth into these allegations whenever they are made. Create a separate part of the government aside from the Homeland Security, where there are investigators that commit their work entirely on one group of terrorists. Sure it might not work right away, but why not try?<br /><br />A few of the cities/airports targeted were Los Angeles International Airport, Dulles Airport in Washington D.C., New York, Miami and lastly but not least, Boston. Doesn't that make you angry as hell, as well as scared, that someone was targetting YOUR home turf. I'm furious, it makes me want to go out there and do something. I think most people should feel that way now. Whatever happened to those times when we all lived in peace, and nothing awful happened in the world. Oh wait, sorry, i drifted off into a fantasy land or the movie ""Pleasentville"". There hasn't been a time like that. Look back on past events that scarred a generation, religion, or people. (in no particular order...)<br /><br /><br />

I'm gonna try and do something to change the world, and I hope everyone else does so too. It could be something little, but it would be better than nothing. World War III? Seems plausible, but we would have drastic changes in the world and millions would die, we don't WANT or NEED for that to happen. Just think of this went through today and the supposed bombed places in NY (again), Boston, LA, etc. This could have been the Golden Gate Bridge, Prudential, White House or Capitol Building...<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.savannahnow.com/images/091201/full_rescuework.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />I hope you all think about this and try to make a difference, I know I will."

Since the last time I wrote I have (in no particular order)...<br />
<ul>
    <li>Graduated college</li>
    <li>Still have yet to get a full time job</li>
    <li>Been to the beach</li>
    <li>Met someone <em>truly </em>amazing.</li>

    <li>Attended the FREE Yellowcard concert</li>
    <li>Was told by my grandfather there could be another World War coming</li>
    <li>Got reaquainted with long time friends</li>
    <li>Got ridiculous amounts of sun burns</li>
    <li>Played DDR, in public, and got pushed off the dance pad by the other person playing ;)</li>
    <li>Watched the Sox begin to self-destruct by NOT trading for anyone</li>
    <li>Realized that you can never know who to trust</li>
</ul>
Of those things theres only a few things I want to touch upon.<br />
<ol>
    <li>Being reaquainted with old friends is amazing. It's such a good feeling when you get the phone call or message saying ""hey we should hang out sometime"". Makes you feel like someone really cares out there.</li>
    <li>Seeing as some people care about you, of course, there are people that probably don't give two shits about anything that your involved with. You know, those people that sit there and get amusement by talking about others behind their backs, or saying negative things to someone who YOU care about a lot. I mean it's one thing to say something truthful, but its another if you decide to try to put a wrench in something someone else is working hard at to make perfect. Now I understand things can't be perfect, but you can try, and I know damn well I am. But when someone (who is apparently a douchebag) decides to tell someone i care about something about me thats not even remotely true, I get offended. I don't care who said it, all I know is... well... I'm better than that person. I've never ONCE said anything awful about someone behind there back, because I wouldn't want any of that coming back to me. No I don't have an ego, no I don't think I'm better than everyone... just that one person.</li>
    <li>I also still haven't gotten a job, but hell, I don't care. I'll get one eventually. And when I do, I'll commit 100% to it (if it's in my field of study). I really hope I get one of the two jobs I'm applying for. It would be amazing. <br /></li>
</ol>
That's all I have to say I guess. I'm in one of those moods where if someone doesn't care about me, why the hell should I care about them. I'm starting to see who really cares, and to be honest, theres only a few people out there. So to all those whom I see that I feel doesn't care about me, mine as well say goodbye now. Could be your last chance.<br /><br />Warped tour #8 tomorrow. Maybe the last one i'll ever go too. Sad, sad day."

"event","<strong>The rules are:<br />1] Once you've been tagged you have to make a post about 6 weird habits, quirks or just facts about yourself, proving you're just as big of a freak as the person who tagged you.<br />2] In the end you need to list 6 other people to tag and put their names in your entry.</strong><br /><br />1.&nbsp; I own an extensive collection of Spiderman merchandise, apparel... you name it, I probably have it. I indeed have the ""silly string web shooting device"". I think that's what the name of it is, haha. I have posters, movies, games, comics, my own drawings...etc. I guess you can say I'm a pretty huge fan.<br /><br />2. I love more music than many of the other hobbies or things I do. I have over 300 cd's, and have more than 6,000 songs minimum in my song collection on my computer and at home. Yes I know that you can download every song for free, but I like to support the artists. I buy the music from Itunes, when i have the money, and just throw them on a cd. My favorites include ""Lights and Sounds"" by Yellowcard, ""Use Your Illusion parts 1 and 2"", My SBA Louisiana Mix, and ""A Season in Hell"" by October Fall.<br /><br />3. I have a nervous habit that happens in different ways. If I lie, which I try not to do, my right eye-lid twitches. If I'm in a fight, before I punch with either hand, my hand starts to twitch and the same goes for my feet. When sitting down, if my foot is flat it doesn't move. However, if it's on the ball or my toes, then it bounces uncontrolably (which I can't stop). I need to work on that. <br /><br />4. I too, like Kate, enjoy being naked. But only under certain circumstances. Like, sleeping naked is a-ok with me. Parading around my pod ass naked, sorry it ain't gonna happen. I love sleeping that way because i feel more free to like move around and just relax. Yes, I know I'm crazy.<br /><br />5. I am OBSESSED with Dr. Pepper. Anything that has or includes those words I would like. For example, a Dr. Pepper Float (instead of&nbsp; Root Beer Float). It's absolutely amazing. So if you see a fun item that has Dr. Pepper on it, go out and snag it for me, I'm poor and didn't get many birthday presents. <br /><br />6. Last but certainly not least, I am completely die hard about the Red Sox. Now I'm sure you know people who say that, but I'm not sure they live up to these standards. 1. have autographs of legendary and recent players of the Red Sox, which include Ted Williams, Tim Naehring, Nomar Garciaparra, Trot Nixon, Jason Varitek, Mike Greenwell, Dwight Evans, Mo Vaughn, Tony Fossas/Phil Plantier (haha remember these guys). Baseball cards out the wazoo, pictures at Fenway Park, your name on the inside of the Monster, authentic (expensive) plaques with infield dirt in it, been to at least 50+ easily in the last 10 years (I don't feel like counting, but it could be over 80). Newspaper clippings of great feats past and present Spent tons of money on a somewhat rainy, chilly night to watch them, even when they weren't going to make the playoffs. Buying and watching religiously the DVD set of the 2004 ALCS/World Series. Went to a game where they got eliminated from the playoffs (last year, against the other Sox), but cheered and tried to get the lame crowd to actually care, which they didn't. There's a ton more, but I'll stop there.<br /><br />Tags too: I dont know if I have 6 friends on here, so if you want to do this feel free."

"event","There are times in a persons life where they have an experience that changes everything. The way they think, the way they do things, and the way that they believe in things. Spring break in Minden, Louisiana was that time for me. It was the most amazing experience I've ever had. I found myself that week, and found out what it was like to have thirteen other people get so close to you that makes you realize that people are kind and have faith in you, even if they don't know you all that well. I found out a lot about my faith, and that it was there all along after all. 

I'll never forget the week I spent in Minden, with thirteen of my newest friends: Katelyn, Christen, Meg, Mike, Adam, Kevin, Katie C., Katie P., Alison, Kristi, Krystle, Nicole, and Therese. I know I will keep in touch with y'all for a very long time. Thank you to each and everyone of you, because you were the ones who made the experience so amazing and rewarding. 

I mean, we built that house on rock and roll.

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now that this is out of the way, onto the fun.</P>
<P>&nbsp;- What's all of this about the Manny/Clement to Orioles trade? This doesn't make any sense. Why would we get rid of one our top hitters and a number 3 starter for a shortstop. Now I understand that Tejada is a great SS, but seriously, why make more holes than we need right now. We still need a CF, SS, and backup 1B. If we traded Manny and Clement, we'd need another starting pitcher, a LF, a CF and a backup 1B. C'mon Sox, get on the ball, stop ruining our team.</P>

"event","<P>So, you know how that whole, ""you have time to yourself some nights so you basically think the whole time"" thing goes? Well I've been doing a lot of it lately, of course mixed in with house work, cleaning, moving furnitature around in my house and watching the occasional movie. (*Four Brothers is a damn good movie, I recommend it to anyone*) Anyway back to that whole thinking thing... ever realize that maybe your selling yourself short at all? I feel like I've been working my ass off and not giving myself enough credit for things. I mean, I don't like taking credit publically for things, I don't like being in the limelight getting awards or whatever, but I do the things I do for others, not because I want personal benefit. Take for example Kids Cafe. That place is my life, and some of the administration on campus wants me talking about how I changed these kids lives and all this crap. Yeah I have tried to change their lives so they could have a positive influence on their future, that was my main goal in helping these kids out. Then I realized that these kids changed <STRONG>me</STRONG>. Right now I can't pinpoint exactly how they did, but I know they did for the better. </P>
<P>I got my grades today. I kicked ass in my Criminal Justice classes, but did subpar in my other three. At least I didn't fail Child Psych which made my day. That made me think too. I'm so glad I'm actually good in the field I want to go into when I graduate. At least I'm not a someone who is struggling with their major and doing well in everything else. Which takes me to part number three.</P>
<P>Graduation. Yeah I know, graduation is coming and no one wants to talk about it, but we have too. May is creeping up around the corner. Actually ya know, I don't want to think about it right now, it's kind of depressing.</P>
<P>Ok, thats enough for now, more thoughts at a later date. Enjoy your last day of 2005 everyone, and Happy New Year!</P>"

"event","So I haven't updated in a while. There has been way to much going on. I
wish I could sum it up in one word, but that would be too difficult.<br>
<br>
My thesis has been tough, I somehow saved over it when I was wicked
over tired last week. I'll get it done by Sunday or I'll flip out.<br>
<br>
Classes are hard this semester. I'm studying my ass off and yet seem to
get no where. It's really really frustrating. I have 2 d's and a c-...
it's really irritating.<br>
<br>
Since everyone is so wrapped up in thesis', I barely see anyone. But
when I do, it's always a great time. I even got to see Kath @ Umass
last weekend on Friday. I really needed to see her, whenever I'm down
so far where I think I can't get out, I know she'll be there to help me
through in any way she can. Kath = most amazing friend ever, you should
all aspire to be as good a friend as she is. And I met an amazing girl
this weekend. I've met Lauren before, but I got to know her that night
at the AXO Date Party. But that is another story for another time.
Because it requires me to go into detail about the most amazing night
I've had in a long time. F it, here we go. I went to the AXO sorority
date party at UMass last friday. My date, was my best friend Kath. We
had an awesome time, her friends are amazing and we all drank, danced
and partied till the break of dawn. Well not that late, but late
enough. Kath was out of stream of consciousness by 1:00 in the morning.
So I hung out with Ally, Gus and Lauren. We threw in ""Girl Next Door""
and the night went on from there. I got to talk to Lauren a lot since
Gus and Ally went to bed and she's a sweetheart. I feel lucky enough to
spend that time with her. So there's my story, bitches, haha. <br>
<br>
I went to the Panic At The Disco, Boys Night Out, Motion City
Soundtrack, Starting Line and Fall Out Boy concert tonight with my 13
year old sister Deanna and her friend Melissa. It was a really good
show, well after the first two bands got out of the way. Starting Line
of course kicked HUGE ass. They put on an amazing show the two times
I've seen them and they played some songs I haven't heard live before.
Fall Out Boy was actually really good too, so that made the show all
the much better. All the much better? Is that proper english. Anyway,
it was a good show and I'm glad I got to bring my sister too it. <br>
<br>
<br>

Thanksgiving break starts at 11:30 today, thank god. I need this break.
I get to go home, see my whole family, well 1/2 of my family at least.
I get to see Kath and Nikki, and I'm sure I'll stop by the Hyde Park
Pharmacy to get some food someday. It's gonna be a well deserved break.<br>
<br>
So for now I'm off for Thanksgiving break, after classand a meeting
with my professor for an Internship. But of course, before I get home,
I'm getting dinner and seeing a movie with Lauren, which I'm sure is

<br>
This weekend was just as amazing as last weekend. Chuck and Becky's
party was awesome, cept for the heinous woman downstairs. ""I have to
wake up at 6 am! blah blah bliggity blah"". Funny, i had to be up at
8:00, and went to bed at 6 am bc I watched a movie with Jennie and
couldn't sleep after that really. Damn movies make me awake all the
time.<br>
<br>
I was Jeff Hardy for Halloween, if you don't know who he is google ""The
Hardy Boyz""... I'm the one with the cut arm bands. Pictures will be
available soon.&nbsp; Andy was Hulk Hogan, Tanya was Gwen Stefani,
Heather was Madonna, Amanda was the Cheerleader from SNL (which was a
great costume). Chuck was a soldier, Becky was a nurse, Melissa was
Glitter, Ryan was Homestar Runner and Tonya was a police officer. Great
night overall, you all shoulda been there!<br>
<br>
And today, well today (Saturday), was the longest, but most rewarding
day in a while. I worked from 1 - 5 at the Kids Camp part of the
football game. We had a bunch of kids over who were children of alumni
to paint pumpkins, play some soccer and have a great time. Great start
to the day. Then was Battle of the Bands (BOB from now on) was tonight.
I got there at 5, and left at 12:30 in the morning. Such an amazing
time. We all had an awesome time hanging out and working, listening to
some great bands (listen to Streamline, Accurate Enemy, Tables Up, and
Release). Me and Johnny B were door checkers, which meant we had to pat
down/frisk every guy that came in. It wasn't the best job in the world,
but we had to make sure everything was safe. I did some truck surfing
in D.Forbes' truck while he was driving, always a great time. Then I
came back here and ended up going with Jennie to get some of her
friends from Strangebrew. Went over to her place to hang out with all
of them and now, at 3:15 I'm finally back in my room. Let's see if I
make&nbsp; it to the ENA BBQ tomorrow.<br>

"event","So this weekend was by far the FUNNEST week/weekend I have experienced
here at this school. Here, I'll do a day by day analysis for yo' asses.
<br>
<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">
Wednesday -</span> Nothing REALLY exciting, cept I played Nintendo for about
two hours, I needed a good dose of Blades of Steel and Double Dribble.
Hell yeah.<br>
<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">
Thursday - </span>I didn't get my Criminal Law test back so that basically
already made me believe this weekend would be awesome, which was a
plus. So the day went on and I went to work and had some fun at Kids
Cafe. Played some dodgeball and had a great time. Got back and plopped
myself into a chair at the coffee shop to await the mini concert that
we had. <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"">Alisa</span> came by so I wasn't alone haha, then <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Aubrie</span> came by. I
told her about the concert that day, I wasn't expecting her to come,
but I was glad she did. <span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 255); font-weight: bold;"">Kate</span> came along and so did <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">Jeremy</span>. We watched
the bands Superlow and Junction 18 play some songs. They both kicked
ass. I've listened to Junction 18 for a couple of years now and they
were amazing. Superlow kicked ass as well. We all had a fun night and again knew, that this weekend would be one to remember. <br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Friday - </span>During this week, I
have been helping Chuck and <span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">Becky</span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""></span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""></span>move into their new place. Which is
freakin' sweet let me say. So I went back over today and did some more
moving. It was a crazy day with random things happening. We finally
finish, get some pizza and hang out for a little. The movers consisted
of myself, <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"">Chuck</span>, <span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;"">Andy</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">Jeremy</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ryan</span>,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Tonya</span>,&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">Becky</span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""></span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""></span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""> </span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"">Chuck</span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"">'</span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"">s</span> dad.
Let's just say we got all the things in rapido because we had so many
people. Me, <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">Jeremy</span> and Andy leave,&nbsp; and decide we want to play
some poker. Get back to Saint A's and end up basically throwing a huge
party. We all have a great time, stay out late and have a ton of
laughs. It was great getting a ton of people together, we had basically
the whole ""old school"" M crew there (<span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 255); font-weight: bold;"">Kate</span>, <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"">Alisa</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tiny</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Beth</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 204, 204);"">Amanda</span>)
and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">John</span> and<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Jarrod</span> were there as well. <span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;"">Andy</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Melissa</span> and <span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"">Tanya </span>also
came by, so we had a kick ass party.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Saturday - </span>I had to get up
REALLY early because my mother was coming. I went to bed around 5:45 in
the morning because I was talking to <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Aubrie</span> on the computer about a ton
of things. It's been a while where I could talk to someone about what
we wanted our lives to look like when we graduated from here. Granted
that made me sad to think about, but better start thinking about it now
then just waiting till May. Anyway... my mother came up and we went and
ordered my school ring. We went out to lunch at the Olive Garden, which was amazing. We ended up seeing <span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"">Tanya</span>,<span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;""> Andy</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"">Heather</span> there. We left then went to the store for a few and back to school. I said goodbye and began to plan my night. <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Aubrie</span> was going to come over to hang out so I cleaned my room forever, went over <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"">Chuck</span> and&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">Becky</span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">'</span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">s</span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""> </span> and helped do the last of the moving with <span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;"">Andy</span> and came back. <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Aubrie</span> came by and we played some <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Super Mario Bros.</span> 1 and 3. Derek and Erin stopped by and we went over to G where we met up with <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"">Alisa</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tiny</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Melissa</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">Jeremy</span>, <span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 255); font-weight: bold;"">Kate</span>,
etc. Headed over to D1, and played some poker. We all had a great time,
laughing, hanging out and having a kick ass time. Myself, <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Aubrie</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Derek</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Erin</span> left and we headed back to M, said bye to <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Aubrie</span> and thus ended Saturday night. Now onto Sunday...<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sunday -&nbsp; </span>Brunch was early at 10:30. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Derek</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Erin</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Lindsey </span>and I went down and had some shitty food. Me and Lindsey started to watch a movie until <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"">Alisa</span> and Beth came back,<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);""> Jeremy</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Derek</span> then came by and we went to M to watch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""Saw""</span>. <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">J </span>and I already saw it and the others haven't. We watched it and saw some great reactions from <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Beth</span> and <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"">Alisa</span>.
Priceless faces haha. Now I'm doing homework and ending this weekend
working on my thesis. Fun times let me tell you. But it's ok, we have a
great weekend to look forward too next weekend. Friday the 28th, <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"">Chuck</span> and<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">Becky</span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">'</span><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">s</span><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);""> </span>Halloween
Party. (I'm being Jeff Hardy from the Hardy Boyz.) Saturday the 29th,
mayyybe seeing Saw II or Stay, if interested let me know. <br>
<br>
<br>
Long entry, but well deserved. This weekend kicked ass, and I wouldn't
change any of it for straight A's at this school. And I mean that. <br>"

<br>
I saw the movie ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"". It was an amazing
movie, I recommend you go see it or borrow it from me. It will really
make you think about your life and how your living it. I realized the
small things I've avoided lately, and I'm going to start paying
attention to those things. Figure out what and who is in your important
in your life and be there for them as much as you can. You never know
when things are gonna end. <br>
<br>
I heard something on the news last night after ER, which by the way, is
my new favorite show. How could I have missed out on this show for so
long?? Anyway, I heard on the news that a woman in Pennsylvania was
attacked by her neighbor. This didn't strike me as odd, people are
attacked and on the news all the time. This case really got me pissed
right after they said she was attacked. She was attacked by her
neighbor by getting slashed in the stomach because her neighbor wanted
the baby. What the motherfuck is that about?!?! Some people, I swear to
god, are fucking ridiculous. ""Hey I want your unborn baby, let me cut
your stomach and take it out. This will only take a second."" Seriously,
people like this should be knocked out or something, or maybe given
some common sense. Unfortunately there isn't a surgery or medicine
people can take for that, guess they are just fucked. <br>
<br>
That's it for now. Check back at a later date for new shiz. <br>"

"event","So I got some good news, I got chosen to go on the SBA trip I wanted.
I'm going on SBA Habitat for Humanity. I really am wicked excited. I
get to go somewhere and help people who live there build some houses
and get to know a great group of people. But there's some bad news
about that. It's sad that some people on campus go to such lows to say
horrible things about SBA. Ok, granted to me a year or so ago, it
looked like a cult. But I never heard any of these stories of what they
went through, then I heard some. And I was foolish to even think
something as petty as that. But i see things written about how if
someone sees someone from SBA they want to stab then in the throat with
the sharpest object available, or even burning all the poor people to
get rid of them. Who fucking thinks that way? Well I'm gonna go out on
a limb and say the people who don't give a shit about anyone but
themselves, and who have tremendous immature egos. Pieces of shit, I
hope someday you know what its like to have nothing, living on the
street with one set of clothes and having no money or job. And to
answer the first question you have...<span style=""font-style: italic;""> ""Dave, you haven't been poor, so shut the fuck up.""</span> Well I <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">have</span>
been poor. I spent a week pretty much homeless in rural NY, i lived in
an empty barn for a week. I worked on a farm for nothing, got one meal
a day. We then got transportation to NY City and spent all day in soup
kitchens and on the sides of the road. So before you experience what
it's like to be poor, don't knock it ok? It just makes me sick that
college students can be such assholes. This isn't the only thing thats
been going on campus, there's another big asshole move done by someone,
but I'm gonna keep that to myself. Let's just say a really nice girl
was targeted for a hate crime. <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">A hate crime?! </span>We are in the year 2005, and hate crimes still exist. People make me sick.<br>
<br>
That's my rant for the night. Maybe the people who said all these
things will come to their senses and apologize, or they'll just go on
living with no dignity or respect for anyone but themselves. And if you
try to ""stab me in the neck"", or call me names because I went through
an experience and having time adjusting back to normal life here...
well let's just say I <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">dare</span> you. <br>"

School is going by pretty slow. I'm pretty glad because I want this
year to go by slow. I'm gonna miss college once it's over, so I mine as
well have as much as I can now. I'm getting to see people, but
sometimes it's hard seeing them all the time since I live in <font size=""4""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;"">M</span></font>.
But I'm managing. I'm getting my work done pretty quick, and I'm able
to have some privacy if I just need time to myself, which is always
key. <br>
<br>
I went to 24-hour Walmart with <span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 255);""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kate</span></span>
tonight, it was awesome as usual. We listened to the new Nickelback cd,
bought some freeze pops and then got some TBell. My stomach told me too
fuck off later on. I really should stop eating at the bell, but it's
just so good. haha. Also, I've decided that me and<span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 255);""> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kate</span> </span>have
the funniest conversations outta my close friends. One second we'll be
talking about one thing, then making fun of something the next and
adding witty comments. Bam shizzle.<br>
<br>
Home is coming up this weekend, and I can't wait to see my fam. I miss
em all, including my spaz of a dog. I get to work too which will be
good, seeing as I need some dinero really soon. I'm also taking my
sister and one of her friends to the <span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 204, 51);"">Fallout Boy</span> concert in November. They better be good, unlike the Warped Tour where they sucked ass. <br>
<br>
I bought a black cowboy hat when I went to the Deerfield Fair this
weekend. I wore it and was told by a few people that I look like <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 255); font-weight: bold;"">Kenny Chesney. </span>If that's the case I won't have trouble at all getting a girlfriend <span style=""font-style: italic;"">right</span>? haha. Hey if he could marry Renee Zellwegger than I could... actually that's a bad example. Nevermind. <br>
<br>
I also have gotten some new cd's lately. Here's a short list w/ some comments &amp; best song on it:<br>
&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">* Nickelback - All The Right Reasons (kicks ass, best Nickelback CD by far; ""Far Away""/""If Everyone Cared"")</span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">&nbsp;* Death Cab for Cutie - Plans (not as good as Transatlanticism, awesome nonetheless; ""I Will Follow You Into The Dark"")</span><br>
&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"">* Trapt - Someone In Control (best CD I've bought in a long time, fricken sweet; ""Lost Realist"")</span><br>
&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"">* Coheed and Cambria - Good Apollo IV (words can't describe how awesome this cd is; ""Welcome Home"")</span><br>
&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"">* Receiving End of Sirens - Between the Heart and the Synapse (good all around cd; ""Planning A Prison Break"")</span> <br>
&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 102);"">* Kanye West - Late Registration (best rap/hip-hop CD ever created; ""Heard Em Say""/""Golddigger"")</span><br>
&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"">* Avenged Sevenfold - City of Evil (fucking awesome, 'nuff said; ""Bat Country"")</span><br>
<br>
Well that's it for now... <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">F</span> this is long haha. <br>

""Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up?
Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?
Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost?

I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move
The winter's so cold, summer's over too soon
Let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow

I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand....until you hold my hand""

<br>
""A deal to erase billions of dollars of debt for poor countries cleared
an important hurdle yesterday, winning the endorsement of the
International Monetary Fund's steering committee.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer and
chairman of the IMF's policy-setting panel, announced the breakthrough.
Negotiators had reached agreement on ""all elements"" of the
debt-cancellation proposals, he said, and the IMF's 24-member executive
board will meet soon to formally approve the plan.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""We worked very hard over the last few days, as well as over
the last few months, to try to bring people to agreement on the
proposals,"" Mr. Brown said at a press conference late yesterday.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The agreement would forgive an estimated $40 billion in debt
for at least 18 poor countries -- most of them in Africa -- owed to the
IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">As many as 20 other countries could be eligible if they meet
certain conditions and would push the total amount of debt cancellation
to more than $55 billion. The cost would be spread over decades.
</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMF steering committee endorsed the debt cancellation one
day after the Group of Eight major industrial powers made firm pledges
to underwrite the plan, a commitment intended to overcome the biggest
obstacle to approval by the lending institutions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaders of the world's eight major industrial powers endorsed
a general framework for the proposal at an economic meeting in July in
Scotland, but largely left the details of the forgiveness plan to the
World Bank and the 184-nation IMF to settle.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Bank, a major lender to poor countries, still must
consider the proposal. The annual meetings of the World Bank and the
IMF continue today, and U.S. officials predicted swift approval of the
debt cancellation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Bank and IMF did not want the debt plan to impair
their ability to provide aid. The institutions, joined by Belgium, the
Netherlands and some other countries, sought assurances that the rich
nations would put up the money to cover the loan repayments lost when
the debts are written off.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said he hoped the executive
boards of the IMF and World Bank would approve the deal within a week.
""It will be an historic milestone, and we have done it in such a way to
ensure that there will be no diminution of resources for these great
institutions,"" Mr. Snow said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Finance officials from the Group of Eight countries -- the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and
Russia -- pledged on Friday to ""cover the full cost to offset dollar
for dollar"" the loan repayments that would be lost.</span>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&nbsp;Poor
countries could use the money for education or drugs to fight HIV/AIDS
or malaria, supporters of debt forgiveness said.</span>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Buston, European director for Debt AIDS Trade Africa
(DATA), a debt-relief group started by Irish rock star Bono, hailed the
fresh commitment from the G-8 countries.""<br>
<br>
Finally people are waking up to the poverty around the world, and mostly in Africa. <br>"

"event","Well I haven't updated in a while, so I thought I'd give it a go. Here are some of the things that's been goin' on...<br>
<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">- I got my resume and cover
letter all squared away. Now all I have to do is send it and I'll get
my Internship @ the US Attorney General's Office in Boston. Hell yeah.</span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 51);"">- I bought a few CD's the other
day. I got the new Death Cab for Cutie cd the other day called ""Plans"".
It's pretty f'n awesome. I also got the new Kanye West cd ""Late
Registration"" and Trapt's new cd ""Someone in Control"". Both amazing
cd's. I think I have awesome taste of music. Ps - go out and get the
Coheed and Cambria new cd, it's (as Peter from Family Guy would say)
pretty freakin' sweet. </span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">- Speaking of Family Guy, this new
season (or continuance of the summer season) is unbelieveable. The
movie ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"" is a masterpiece, go out and
buy it when it comes out.</span> <span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"">Brian: ""No Peter I can't, I have a date tonight.""</span> <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Stewie: ""A date huh? What's his name? HA! See what I did right there, I made it look like you were a homosexual.""</span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">- Senior year is going by pretty
slow thank god, except it's been pretty shitty. I've been going through
some shit and seeing my friends go through things I wouldn't wish on
anyone. I'm convinced now there is no god, because of all the awful
things that have been going on here, and all over the world. I know
some of the things are our fault (poverty, hunger, crime, etc.) but the
Hurricane wasn't needed for. Neither are the ""tropical storms"" near
Florida. </span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">- I signed up for SBA yesterday. I
hope I get to go do the Habitat for Humanity or the Native American
Reservation. It would be awesome to give more than I already am. Yeah
I've knocked it before, said it was a cult, but now I'm taking that
back. The people that lead this year are absolutely amazing. I can't
wait for this experience, it's going to last me a life time. </span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">- I saw Trapt and Halestorm a
lttle while ago. It was an awesome show, and it was really really
cheap, meaning it was FREE. I love free amazing concerts, especially
when you meet one of the bands (i met halestorm, check em out on
Myspace.)</span><br>
<br>
That's all for now! Check back soon, and leave some comments for me.<br>"

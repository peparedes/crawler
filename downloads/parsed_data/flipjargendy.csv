I am not sure if I have mentioned it before but the Obnoxium is a strange land which I visit now and then. The only visual documentation of this land has been destroyed by my old web host' sysop... The bastard."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the simplicty of setting up a wordpress blog on any web server worth using I have decided to start a new blog. I know I do not update often but I want it to look nice when I do. Livejournal has never really done anyone well in the way of asthetics. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this blog was simple to browse using text based browsers. If anyone has conflicts with the new blog let me know. I can easily add a lynx friendly portal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new blog is located at: <a href=""http://flipjarg.blinkenshell.org/blog/"">flipjarg.blinkenshell.org/blog/</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will update here now and then but the new blog will be my main one."

"event","<b>Super Dimension Fortress - SDF.Lonestar.org Review</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about eight years I have been using UNIX and Linux systems. For most of that time I have used the services of <strong>SDF</strong>'s (<strong>S</strong>uper <strong>D</strong>imension <strong>F</strong>ortress) ""<em>free</em>"" UNIX shell account. As soon as I signed up I donated $38 to activate my <i>user</i> account and bring it up to an <i>ARPA</i> account. That donation granted me a ""life time"" membership. These accounts are made available for students and anyone else who wants to use a UNIX shell account for educational purposes so it is made to be inexpensive. About two months ago my account was deleted with no explanation and only answered one of my emails after contacting them several times. I never broke any of the rules in the time I had my shell account there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this I lost everything I had saved on that server. This includes pretty much every picture I posted on this blog. Most of these photos I did not have saved anywhere else.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not donate money to SDF.lonestar.org. I have found a new, completely free, shell host who provides more and the sysop is actually involved with the users. Take a look at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blinkenshell.org"">BlinkenShell.org</a> if you are interested in learning Unix or want  free web hosting that offers PHP/CGI and as many MySQL databases as you want. Along with that, since this is a free UNIX shell account you can login with SSH and SFTP access... So you can upload web pages via FTP and setup cPanel (if that's what you want) and manage your website. Or you can use it for hosting pictures and videos like I do."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently an idea struck me. Because I am curious whether or not they would send certain packages or envelopes under certain conditions, the United States Postal Service (USPS) needs some testing . My first test was this: Send an envelope with insufficient postage accompanied by a coin to make up for it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to start out small and work up to more outrageous tests. If you have any ideas on testing the USPS let me know, I will probably try it as long as it's not harmful or illegal, obviously.

<ol><li>I place insufficient postage accompanied by a quarter. I taped the quarter in place of where the other stamp should have gone. I did not use a return address so that they could not send it back, even though they really are sending it back to me, they just don't know it! Then I wrote a note on the side explaining my circumstances.

The note under the postage says (after I took this photo I added ""-thanks"" at the end):
<blockquote>Sorry, I didn't have another stamp but had to send this before the mail was picked up. Here is the change for it.</blockquote>

<center><img src=""http://flipjarg.blinkenshell.org/image/uspsTest/test-01-01.jpg""></center>

<li>Just to be sure they did not grow suspicious, open the envelope and find nothing, I placed a piece of important documentation.

<center><img src=""http://flipjarg.blinkenshell.org/image/uspsTest/test-01-inside.jpg""></center>

<li>I then sent the envelope off in one of those big blue mailboxes. To avoid any extra suspicion I sent it from another city, Fargo.

<li>Usually an envelope arrives at its destination within about three days, however, I did not expect to find this one. But I did. Here's the proof!

<center><img src=""http://flipjarg.blinkenshell.org/image/uspsTest/test-01-03.jpg""><br><br></center>When I sent this envelope to myself I did not think it would succeed. In the case of it succeeding I pictured the quarter removed by a postal worker and a stamp in place of it. As you can see in this photo the quarter was left the envelope throughout its travels. The printing over the postage was scattered into a bunch of little specks because there was too much space between the paper and the printer.<center><br><br><img src=""http://flipjarg.blinkenshell.org/image/uspsTest/test-01-02.jpg""></ol></center>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much new news (sounds like a ""noonoos"". It could be a word a small child uses) to share today. Just bored and feel like writing something. Neal Young is up right now on Rach's (sounds like ""Roks"" if you're using German dialect) mix CD (sounds like ""say day"" if you're still using the German dialect).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=red>I</font>'ve begun my transition to proper typing. I used to read quite a bit about serial killers. There was one in particular that wrote his letters to police and press in all lower case letters except for the word in reference to ones self: the word ""I"". They figured he had an ego problem... too big of an ego. There were a number of other things they looked at in the way he wrote his letters. One of the other things they thought was a good possibility was that he had a speech impediment. They were right about both.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been reading a book on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla"">Nikola Tesla</a> called <i>Tesla: Man Out of Time</i> and have become somewhat obsessed with electricity and Nikola Tesla. Thanks Noraa! This man was an amazing inventor. He was using wireless technology (that he created) in the 1890's. He had a number of very important inventions that have major application in our day. Some reading on this fella will turn up quite a bit of surprising information. As for Thomas Edison, he was quite a sleazy guy. I would list the things he did to disirve this title but I suggest some reading on him to find out what I'm talking about. It's too much to list. Basically he did a lot of patenting of other peoples inventions... but under his name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I have to share a list of Cyborgs that must be shared:
<ol><li><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> - Currently at the end of his electronic brain's life expectancy he's slowly declining into a terrible stupor. This is a report I have received from my sources,""Cyborg Justing Timerlake has been malfunctioning terribly. The owner of this cyborg has become quite annoyed and given up on maintaining him. His latest album, with it's simple drum loops gives Def Leppard's drummer the comfort of knowing loosing his other arm will not ruin his career.</li><br>
<li><strong>George Lucas</strong> - He was created for high commercial income and was programmed very well. Yet, he's also at the end of his life span and has also not been maintained in many years. Thus, the newest <i>Star Wars</i> movies were in theaters prefacing his previous movies.</li></ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more of this report to come..."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with the good: Rach and i stayed at Aaron and Miranda's place. It was a great time. I wish we didn't have to go to the wedding though... at least Ad and Al were there... otherwise i would have used the toilette the whole time (#2) and possibly more. There were some good aspects of the wedding but we stayed too long, i just wanted to hang out with Aaron and Miranda. The weekend was quite a frenzy of odd occurrences. The first night we were there we went out to eat and got some drinks at an interesting little place in Fargo. Then on the way home Aaron and i came upon a rolled over truck in the middle of his road. We thought there would be a bludgeoned man inside but there was instead a mess of drunk people who were friends of the driver. It was interesting watching them, i felt like i was in <i>Run Ronnie Run</i>. At one point these four guys, probably not too much older then me, were trying to flip the large pick-up truck (full length bed) by hand. It did not budge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron and i found out how to make the terrorists next best friend. It's extremely simple to make a tazer out of a regular camera. It produces a very bright flash of light and enough energy to bond the wires to metal. We put quite a few pits in those coins that were trying to take us out. Any terrorist or paranoid traveler could get this through security without a problem. i'll prove it next time i take a flight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next night i was awakened by tiny little fists coming bolting against me. Rachel was doing her waking ritual. i'm a heavy sleeper. Apparently the severe weather sirens had been going off. i thought it was nothing... just a little windy. Besides, the sirens weren't going off by the time i became fully conscious. i looked out the window and the trees were swishing around. Suddenly i heard what really sounded like a train wheels humming, whistle and all. The tree out the back window stopped swishing, instead all of it's branches were being pulled straight across like a gelled hair-do. No damage was done to their home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm going to say that 96.9% of insurance agents are scam artists. i am pretty sure every insurance agent will die at Armageddon."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Rachel and i went shopping for two new suites for me. K&G Men's Store has a sale: purchase two suites and get them for $150.00. We payed a little more though since almost all the suites that are on that sale are on one 3x3 large rack.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i did end up finding some suites that looked good on me. My favorite one was not for me... i tried it on and the bald black guy, Kermit, who looked like he should have been a taxi driver in Florida, said it's a Magic Johnson suite. Apparently Magic has a clothing line? Either way i assumed he was saying is for black people and not a nerdy white guy like some people (not me). When i returned to the dressing room i couldn't help but wonder if everyone sewing up the suites had AIDS or HIV. i figure Magic would hire people he felt an affinity too. Then i thought,""They must have a pretty heavy employee turn over.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kermit helped quite a bit in choosing a suite. i thought i was a size 36 but he said i'm a 40. So i got a suite that fits! He went out to the floor because i was having trouble finding one. He came back with a couple that he thought would suite me well (hehe). Rachel wanted me to get a dark grey suite... yuck! i can't stand shopping for suites they're all so plain."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting case. The man who created the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS"">ReiserFS Journaling System</a> has been accused of murdering his wife. His friend, a witness on the case has just confessed to killing nine people. However, those murders are not connected to the trial. This is a very strange case, take a look at the article below. The oddest thing to me is that i thought programmers did not have wives.


<blockquote style=""width:695px; margin:auto; text-align:justify;""><h2><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/05/reiser#"">Reiser Prosecution Jolt: Victim's Ex-Lover Confesses to Eight Killings</a></h2><b>Thursday, May 3, 2007</b>
<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wired.com/"">Wired.com</a>

<img style=""margin:10px; float:left;"" width=""290"" src=""http://www.wired.com/images/article/full/2007/05/reiser.jpg"">A former lover of the missing wife of Linux programmer and accused spouse killer Hans Reiser has confessed to killing eight people unrelated to the case, prosecutors informed the defense last week.

Sean Sturgeon, a one-time friend of Reiser's, had already been a focus of the defense team's efforts to shift suspicion off Reiser in the disappearance of his estranged wife, Nina Reiser. Sturgeon's alleged confession to a series of unrelated murders will likely complicate the trial, which is set to begin Monday.

""(Deputy District Attorney) Paul Hora indicated that the court was ordering him to divulge this information,"" defense attorney Richard Tamor said last Friday. ""He also said that Sturgeon had confessed to a potential ninth murder, but that Sturgeon wasn't sure if the victim was fully dead when he left him.""

""Sturgeon claims that the murders were in retaliation for his abuse as a child,"" said Ramon Reiser, Hans Reiser's father, who was briefed by the defense team over the weekend and spoke to Wired News on Sunday.

On Monday, Superior Court Judge Don Clay issued a gag order barring attorneys on both sides from discussing Sturgeon.

Prosecutor Hora declined to comment on the confession Thursday, or on any law enforcement investigation of Sturgeon, citing the gag order. ""In fact, I can't even comment on the gag order because the order is sealed,"" Hora said.

Reached by phone Wednesday night, Sturgeon did not deny that he had made the confession.

Sturgeon's answers in the 40-minute interview were frequently evasive, and he declined to answer specific questions about the alleged killings. ""I have offered to be judged for my crimes,"" he said at one point. ""I take responsibility for what I have done.""

Nonetheless, he vigorously denied killing Nina Reiser. ""I've never been a threat to Nina Reiser,"" Sturgeon said. ""I will take a lie-detector test. I will take whatever passes for truth serum these days."" He also indicated that the evidence pointed to Hans Reiser's guilt. ""I will not take credit for what another has done,"" he said. ""Let Hans take a lie-detector test about Nina.""

It's unclear when Sturgeon made the confession -- he would say only, ""I have cooperated since day one."" Asked why he had confessed at all, he responded with this question: ""In a murder case, if somebody has killed, who is a witness, is it relevant? Yes or no?""

When this reporter responded that it was relevant, Sturgeon said, ""Then you have the answer to your question.""

Sturgeon added that confessing was one of the most difficult decisions of his life. He also regrets being a source of distraction in the case, joking that he is not so much a red herring as a ""red Sturgeon.""

Nina Reiser was last seen Sept. 3 at the home Hans Reiser shared with his mother in the Montclair area of Oakland, California. Her van turned up five days later, abandoned on a quiet residential street two miles from Reiser's home. Though no body has been found, Reiser was arrested Oct. 10 after the Oakland Police Department found small drops of blood in his house and in his Honda CRX. DNA testing tied the blood to Nina Reiser.

According to testimony in preliminary hearings in the case, Nina Reiser had once dated Sturgeon, but broke off their relationship in January 2006 because she was unhappy with his lifestyle and taste for sadomasochism.</blockquote>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today was my first day commuting by bicycle since 1999. My dad and i were tearing up a concrete slab at our fist job of the year. i forgot how heavy a 2x2 piece of concrete can be. It was great though! On my bike ride i went about 17 miles all together. i took the long way home and did some premium trail riding on some off-road biking trails. A Doberman came tearing at me, i didn't think he was fenced in, but he was.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think i'm going to start video taping myself riding my bike down trails. i bet i could add some groovy music like <a target=""sheets"" href=""http://uprightcitizens.org/vidcontent/hi/shits2.rm"">in this video</a>. In fact, my video would look a lot like this one."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Rachel and i were walking around our apartment complex when i noticed a cat in one of the sewer drains. It was sitting on the metal drain right underneath the curb. Probably for a little shade. Just as soon as i saw the little hobo he had jumped down into the sewer system! We could still see the little hobo just peaking up at us. It was sitting on a ledge crying.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Oh no."" Rachel said sadly,""something is wrong with him.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""No worries,"" i said,""i will save his life!""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i lifted the enormous manhole off the drain and threw it a at least thirty feet away. i told Rachel not to worry and jumped feet first into the manhole, disregarding the ladder. When i landed below i crouched so that the cat would not be startled. There was a family of Hell's Angels living down there! They claimed the cat was theirs. i knew the cat was hurt so i said,""It is quite obvious that you are not taking into account the well being of this cat. i am going to rescue it from the greasy likes of you people!""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle began. Three burly, bearded grease giants came barreling toward me with chains and mammoth fists. i could hear the of the giants flapping around as they came hurtling toward me. However, it was dark, they were unable to see me. As they got closer and they were able to see me visibly i could sense their fear growing. i met them in their charge with a shrill scream and followed through with destructive power. The battle was mine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As i mounted two of their bikes at once i calmed their terrified woman saying,""i can see my work here is done. i will do no harm to you."" and i roared off leaving the giants and their wives behind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i made my way through the sewers to an exit. i went back to Rachel and gave her one of the motorcycles. We brought the cat home to keep. He had roughed up paws so <strike>we brought him to the vet</strike> i nursed him back to health. i was <strike>crying</strike> so noble. <B>( <a href=""http://flipjargendy.livejournal.com/48157.html#cutid1"">See pictures... no longer hosted</a>)</B>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of us went to a concert last night. i think the band was called <i>Staunch Redhead</i>. The opening band was cool! They were called something like <i>Re-run Movies</i> and they had a lady in a black dress dancing around. There was an Asian girl in the opening band as well. She was also in the second band and i saw her in the crowd a couple of times as well. Every time she was wearing very different clothes. The first time i saw her she was wearing black pants and a t-shirt. Then she was wearing no pants and a puffy shirt. Then when i was leaving i saw she was wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt. And this time she had a purse! Asian people change their clothes super fast!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another strange thing. In the crowd there was this guy to my left. He had curly hair, glasses and a plaid button up shirt that was hanging open to reveal a black shirt. His wife was trying to get really close to me and dance with me and stuff. i was really uncomfortable. He kept grabbing my butt and stuff too. He looked really familiar... and then he said something to me in a sort of witty way with a touch of sarcasm,""Hey man, I like Justin Timberlake."" <b>( <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://emuse.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/18919"">Don't you <i>see</i>?

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel got an email the other day from a friend of hers which basically said that the prophecy in Matthew 24:14 has been fullfiled. It mostly concluded that we are in the Great Tribulation. If you get it i'd delete it. i don't know who would actually believe something like this that they find on the internet or get in an email but apparently people are forwarding it to friends.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a minute ago i guess Rachel talked to someone who also got this email and she was told that brothers from another Kingdom Hall have informed people of the email and told them they should delete it."

We toured the brewery there and tested some of the beer out... it passed. i got to eat German food all weekend! The best part though was that we gave eachother presents. She bought me a Mike Scheer drawing!!! i almost cried. She didn't even know i wanted one she knew i liked his stuff though. It was amazing. She got me some other great stuff that only i would care about though, stuff i can use... a great backpack for biking around or running from people with. It straps to me! A great hat and sweater too. Zam! i love it!

Just something to write on. But mostly i don't have any use for it anymore. i just don't need much, i've got my typewriter. i basically wrote on here because it was asthetically pleasing to my eye. Now i've got the typewriter, it looks good. sometimes since it's a super typewriter from a very unknown inventor from the late seventies. He made the machine speak, gave it a personality. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was indeed a great inventor. The typewrite gives me ideas now and then and we carry on conversations when Rachel is gone. He has a voice that would probably be annoying to her. The kind of voice a tweeking monkey might have. Wow, he's a fun guy... typewriter. Well good night."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't want to read about bodies, skip down to a story!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday i got to do something i was looking forward to very intensely. i went to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/pages/home.asp"">Body Worlds</a> exhibit yesterday with my friend Jeff. It was one of the most interesting and exciting things i've ever seen. Most of the bodies they used were not behind glass, only one or two of them were so you could get very close and look at something only inches away if you wanted a good look. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've always been interested in anatomy and have looked at text books with models of the insides of a human. i've always thought it would be interesting to have a cadaver to just open up and look around in. This was the closest i'll get to doing that but i probably saw more then i'd ever see doing that on my own. There were not only bodies that were intact with only nerves left over or just the blood vesels left over but they also cut the whole body from head to toe into slices so thin they were transparent. Basicaly you could see everything inside the human body how it is layed out and how it looks in certain motions. It was amazing!!! For some reason it made me hungry when i told Jeff that he said that was weird. i just read that Danny DeVito said the same thing though, so i know i'm not alone! Take that Jeff!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a competing exhibit by a Chinese man who worked for Gunther von Hagens, the one who did Body Worlds. He now works for the Chinese Government and is suspected of using bodies of people killed in Chinese Prison Camps. Strange.


<b>Sherman Hunter, Done Hunting</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman Hunter walked alone with his cane and his baseball cap on what he had left for his head. He lost part of it in a freak accident while he was searching for the body of a young man who had driven into the river months ago. They had suspected he'd fallen asleep at night. Since the drowned young man did not seem to be wearing his seatbelt his body must have just floated limply out of the driverside window. The window was down half way down, quite odd, the young man must have been a pretty small petunia.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway Sherman Hunter was one of the men who found him. The news reports of course wanted to report on the story and Sherman was one of the people on the top of the list for those reporters to interview. Sally Holmes, from some news station was the first to interview Sherman Hunter. She was formerly a terrorist from another country who had given up her terrorist ways except for recent events in Las Angles moved her to go back to her violent protesting. On the day she interviewed Sherman Hunter she strapped small explosives to the inside of her microphone and prepared to air her first terroristic protest in years. All went well except for her explosives were very small and barely did damage to the microphone and less damage to Sherman Hunter, the man who found the little petunia. Where everything went wrong though was when a Vietnam veteran.  overheard the explosion from the microphone he went into defense mode and tossed a grenade toward the sound of the explosion. He'd just been released from a mental institution earlier that day. No one knows how he got the grenades and handgun they later found on him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman Hunter is fifty-three now and wears a baseball cap of his favorite baseball team on the tip of his lopsided and pointy head. He scratches it now and then to make sure his hat is still there, people think he's just scratching his head though. He was a small time celebrity visited often by fellow small time clebrities who had done one good deed or another the most memorable, a man named Yaqui. He'd accused Sherman Hunter of attacking him with a buey knife.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After loosing part of his head Sherman Hunter vowed to himself never to search for bodies or do any other good deeds again. He wished he never found that little petunia or helped old women across streets or any of those good deeds."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i just read a comment someone wrote on Josh's blog. i think i'm going to be like that annonymous poster. i am going to be an old man one day... i think i'll fly kites and give candy to little children if that's still acceptable still. i think i'll build model space crafts instead of model airplanes since airplanes will be thing of the past. i am going to eat baby food again because i will have a reason too. i'm going to eat it with my gums and try not to get cut by the spoons that will by that time be made of the newest metal that will be worth more then gold. i'm going to pee my pants and blame in on my age, it doesn't seem to work yet. i just can't wait to make people feed me and change my underwear and wipe my butt. i won't have to do anything. i'm going to be rich and will be smarter then most of the population because i'm older. i can say,""Hey! Wipe my butt better then that young lad!"" and he'll get mad but he'll have to respect me because i pay him very very little and don't tell the border control that he's an illegal immigrint. He'll be able to spell better then me unless Josh teaches me to read and write a little better and feed me my baby food. By the way, Josh, i hope you don't mind feeding me when i look like this... oh and yes i'm going to be a black old man, they seem to be cool when their old. So imagine me like an old black men, minus the swearing and racial slurs and all.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilsby. Tilsby was an old man with no money, no family, no friends and no hair. He wore a pink rabbit's foot around his neck on a gold chain. The gold chain he received from a talking owl who watched over him when he slept. Tislby was terrorized by a small family of mice who lived in the woods with Tilsby. And please note that due to the rapid spawning of mice the average size of a mouse family is around five hundred. Not many people know about Tilsby, he lives in the middle of the woods and his only friends are the animals and bugs, all of them, excluding the mice which terrorize him day and night when they can.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilsby with his pink rabbit foot on the gold chain ran across the valleys and ran through the bushes and rolled in the leaves with little racoons, this was his occupation. He enjoyed it. Due to the long hours he was looking for other employment and came upon a young rabbit with no eye for detail. The only reason i knew this is because not one of the rabbits liked Tilsby, in fact they had been holding a grudge against him for the past three years after an incident where Tilsby was picking berries and tripped on a root, fell onto a rabbit and killed him. The rabbits believed Tilsby killed the rabbit for taking raspberries. Anyway, the young rabbit with no eye for detail missed the fact that Tilsby had been wearing a rabbit foot around his neck. It was the the foot of the rabbit he'd killed on that grim day. Tilsby was mortified and has no longer been the same since. He had long awaited a chance to make peice with the rabbits and saw this as a chance to do so, he knew what he had to do. He looked the young rabbit in the eye with a nice smile, despite the fact of having no teeth, and asked him,""Need some help with some berries and some eating and picking of berries? i'd like to help you and give you some hugs.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the man for some time as rabbits do the young rabbit stood on two and spoke quite dantily saying,""If you'd really enjoy helping my little self then join me and you can be a rabbit too.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many days of friendship Tilsby and the young rabbit hopped around picking berries, eating berries, rolling in grass and stomping the ground with their feet. The young rabbit streatched out his arms layed on the ground and stroked his pet stick which had only one brown leaf dangling by barely nothing. He talked about his day and how he'd enjoyed the company of Tilsby. Tilsby, following the example of the young rabbit, met his very own peice of vegitation a strawberry plant which he went to every day after work to talk with and share secrets with."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When i worked at Target and the guy named Johan and i hung out at Perkins after work. He lived out of his van, he was from some state like Iowa or something, supposedly here visiting his father. Something odd about him, can't figure it out, i have to accept his invitation to go to Perkins after work and find out what this sort of energy i'm getting from him. What is it!? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard, i wish i hadn't made fun of him in first grade, he's watching me now, he has been since he was able to come back in touch with me in highschool. He remembered me. He's been watching me since then and is going to have children at the same time i do to seak out his revenge. His children are going to be cruil to my children because i laughed at him when he pee'd his pants in first grade. Don't kill me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Excuse me, are you from around here?"" came the little Asian sloshy voice,""I'm trying to find Rice Street and Duluth.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Uh.. i'm.. i am but i haven't been for very long, i just moved here."" i tell him smiling,""i could try but i wouldn't want to mislead you.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Oh, ok."" he says as i say good bye and walk away,""Did you come here straight from work?"" he asks me in his slippery Asian accent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to gather exactly what i said i told him that i do work, that i'm a caretaker but when i realized what he'd actually asked i told him that i'd just come from a Bible Study. And completely ignoring the question he asked,""Are you looking to make money outside of what you do?"" and i tried my best to gather what he'd said as fast as i could.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Oh, no, i've actually got some other things going on right now."" i told him refering to the work i will be doing with my father, at least hopefully.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""You don't even know what this work is."" he told me using far to many ""W"" sounds than really should have been used,""Why don't you let me show you what kind of work I'm talking about. Come to my car and I'll show you. It will not take long.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i agreed, as long as long as he was quick i said. He led me to a white and red Honda with a ""very expensive custom paint job"" that cost him a fortune, at least that's what he said. He handed me his card and told me not to loose it because i'd need it later. He opened the trunk revealing a rifle with a scope on it that reflected the lights above us in the parking lot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i could not beleive what was happening. i didn't completely know what he was suggesting but i knew it wasn't good. ""Um.. i.. i don't think i can take part in this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grabbing my wrist he told me,""No, you are the one I'm looking for. If you don't carry out what I'm about to ask you to do I will kill you.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that this man was not the friendly little fella i'd thought he was at first i agreed and told him that i'd try my best to do what he wanted, the whole time intending to go home, call the police and not ever call this little man..."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sort of hairy creature named Skip. The name was quite ironic due to the sort of hop like way he walked. He had lost one of his legs after being hit by a car one day some time ago. Even that didn't stop him from getting out and about, he was a high spirited fella who liked his air and open space, and sometimes he liked his small space under the deck and on the chair in the living room. All in all, Skip was a friendly fella who liked the simple things. This is why his story is still being told. i guess the story explains why.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skip and his friend, Adison, were off to see Sun Crystal Revolution, Adison's favorite band. The concert was going to be held outside and it was free so Adison decided to bring Skip along to enjoy the people and the outrdoors with him. Unfortunatly, as soon as the two arrived a car with four girls in it doing their makup for the friends they were going to meet swerved at them. Adison was lucky enough to have been watching but a much more grim fate came for Skip. He was hit by the car, coincidentaly driven by the four girls who he'd been excited to see the first time he'd met them, only two days ago. This time he was not excited to see them, nor would he be ever again. Instead he would fear them with tremling of his one less knee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more then a two months after his recovery Skip was hopping around enjoying the sun. He'd run the best he could having lost his leg and then pause to get some water from a river he liked to watch and listen to with Adison. Forgeting about the loss of his leg Skip leaned to step on a rock and instead plopped right into the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he swarbled downt he river and tried his best to swim to shore he thought for a moment and then yelled the best he could to Adison that this was why you shouldn't drive while putting on makup in a car.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adison, mistaking Skip's pleas for help as playful barking, went on reading his book as Skip was flung over the edge of the waterfalls to one day arrive in the Atlantic Ocean.

It'll be posted soon, it's a fun one. i can't wait to do some longer story lines, Rachel is really good at doing it. She helped add in some parts when i couldn't think of anything, we're going to make some awesome ones this summer, oh man, i can't wait!

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i just checked my email a few moments ago and found an email in my 'Junk' folder regarding a deceased relative of mine. His lawyer has offered 45% of my relatives 28.3 million dollars. At the end of it it said for me to send my Passport information, home address and one other thing i cannot remember now. All i have to do is give him the information so he can contact me, i'm sure. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reply address was is listed below, i found it odd that my relatives, none of which live in Europe have a lawyer with a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://yahoo.co.uk"">Yahoo.co.uk</a> email address....sounds like identity theft to me, if not that then terrorists!

i've edited out his email address, that's the only change i've made. 

<blockquote><b>The Email:</b>

ATTN:Raveling

I am Barr.Patrick Diallo, solicitor and notary public, the personal attorney to Mr. Mark Raveling, a national of your country.On the 21st of April 2004, my client, his wife and their only son were involved in a car accident along Accra / Kumasi express road. Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident, since then i have made several enquiries to locate any of my clients extended relatives and this has also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over theInternet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you.I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where my client lodge these huge deposits.Particularly, the bank where the deceased had an account valued at about U.S$28.3 million U.S dollars. Consequently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within a short time.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over some years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased ; We will share fortune thus  50% for me and 45% to you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may require. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to backup the claim.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me through my e-mail (***************lo_chambers03@yahoo.co.uk) to enable us discuss further.

Thanks for your kind co-operation

Barr.Patrick Diallo</blockquote>"

Mike came over and hung out until my parents got home, and then Mike, my parents, and I sat around talking for a while. The Mike and I went out to lunch. Got Mexican. I actually enjoyed it. It was delicious. Then we came back to my house, and watched Shreck 2 with my parents.

Mike is so awesome. Im so glad he is keeping in touch with our family even now that Kevin has passed away. Its amazing. People are just amazing in general.

Theres this punk kid and hes tall and heavy, but it looks fine on him.. I just think he's the most adorable thing ever... so I was walking by him and he grabs this tiny kid and said ""Stop it, Stop it"" not like begging or mean or loud.. just quiet and warning him to stop something.. and i was like uhhh...
Then the little kids teacher comes over and gets him.. and then the kid and his friends and his teacher were walking behind me.. and the little Kid was like ""yeah i was like 'lets go make fun of that kid because he has boobs.'"" then one of his friends was like ""yeah, and he's wearing eyeliner.."" and then the teacher starts laughing and is like you are getting an 'F' for the day.. joking with the kid....

Im like WHAT THE FUCK??? He had nooooo right to say that to that kid... Way for all of them to be mature...
and thats why i hate high school.. its just a big bunch of immature people.. not just the students.. a whole lot of the teachers.

and i opened it and on the inside it said all this stuff about Im sorry i cant be down there for your birthday. I will give you your gift when you get up here. I hope things are good down there. take care of my stuff for me. dont worry its fun up here. You'll have a blast.

"event","last night was real rough emotionally.. first night since Kevin died. There was just so much that triggered it though.

My parents put an offer on a house yesterday but the builder came back and wanted $25,000 more to finish the attic instead of the basement, he said he would not pave the drive way, putstainless steel knobs on the cabinets instead of brass, wire for an alarm system and put french doors up between the kitchen and the family room...  he wouldnt do any of it.. he didnt want more money.. he just wouldnt do it. the sheet also said that we had to put down a minimum of $1,000 so we put down $5,000 to show we were really serious, and the builder came back and said he wanted $10,000 down instead... 
So needless to say we decided we dont want that house, because we dont want to have to deal with a builder who doesnt want to cooperate with the person buying the house.
What an ass.

Any ideas? It doesnt have to be just for over my heart. it can for anywhere. I just dont know what is good for memory tattoos. Im not really into the whole angel thing. yet i dont want it to be tasteless that if i got it people would be like thats fucked up or something....

John called me today... I really hope he doesnt get too clingy... eek.... he's really nice and all but you know.... Kevin told him he could not ask me out when he asked kevin if he could.... and now he wants to go out this weekend... to do something fun.. although he told me there is nothing fun to do in Virginia Beach... so then i was wondering how we'd go out and do something fun if theres nothing fun to do... but i didnt ask.

DJ also called me today... he can get clingy that'd be fine with me haha.... Meryl thinks him and i will get married.. I dont think that there's any hope for romance there. he's too popular for me, and he dates skinny cute chicks.. and plus he's like my other Older brother. he told my mom at the funeral that he is going to call me and we are going to hang out during spring break, but that Kevin told him if he ever made a move on me he'd kill him... soooo.... I guess he'll never make a move on me... Depressing? almost. Hes amazing. He cares so much and it feels good to know that. I never knew how highly he thinks of my family. I should have known, my family raised him for the most part.. I dont know.... He said hes going to try to call me every weekend. I hope he does, but i know how easy it is to just stop calling and all.. but he told me i can call him anyday anytime so if he stops calling me i guess ill call him.

Oh by the way dont ask me if im in a bad mood... it just pisses me off... Due to circumstances i think im allowed to have a bad day everyonce and a while... even if it is out of the ordinary. 

Im home alone.... I threw a dance party... no one came... not that i invited anyone...

I had a dream last night that kevin was lying in his hospital bed unconcious... and i went over to him and put my hands on his arm and he woke up and was like HEEEEYYYYY! and I was like HEY!!! HOW ARE YOU??? and he was like Im doing great. I feel Awesome! 
It was strange Im not sure how to feel about that. I guess that its like his way of saying Im good dont worry about me any more.... You know?? I mean he doesnt have to worry about cancer anymore. He never really suffered.. but hes not suffering and will never get the chance to. he's resting now. I understand that.. I just want to hang out with my brother. I dont think its really set in yet that he has passed away. Its really going to hit hard on mother's day. Him and I would always plan for weeks ahead on what to do for mothers day. This year i'll be doing all that on my own. Its going to be so much more different.

Everything is going to be so much more different. Ive lost so much over my lifetime, and I mean i try not to complain about it or anything. Most people dont even know about any of it.. but this loss really hurts my heart.... People who know me know I LOVE my brother. I adored him and just thought he was awesome. People who knew us knew we were the best friends that it was hard to find closer siblings... It just seems like he shouldnt have died. I miss him so much.

I keep finding stuff on the internet that Im like man I wonder if kevin has seen that yet. Then I realize I cant call him and tell him about it. That really breaks my heart. 

but theres something i noticed about people who die young like kevin. I dont think they know they are going to die young, but I think subconciously theres something there knowing they will and its not something that they will ever realize. and I say this because its the people that die young that through out their whole life time just seem to live life to the fullest and experience so much at a young age..... i dont know i cant explain it... 

either way i think i just need to go to bed..."

Visitation was amazing.. Over 300 people came... I couldnt believe it. Soooooooo many people came from places that were so fat away, and it was like why did you come??? why didnt you just send a card or something? Of course we appreciated it so much.

The funeral today was just beautiful... Just beautiful. I couldnt imagine a nicer service.
Again so many people. I was surprised how many people came despite that it was during school and work hours..

It was amazing. Just amazing

so im trying to make sure all of kevins friends keep in touch with our family... but there was this guy who used to have a crush on me... and he was hanging all over me today and yesterday.. it was sweet but i dont take clingy people well, and Kevin DID NOT want him and i to get together. 

but everything is going well... so tomorrow is burial, and that will be the hardest thing... but i didnt cry at visitation i didnt cry at the funeral, and i hope not to cry tomorrow but tomorrow probably will be the hardest...

but i just hope things will remain peaceful.. but once people stop coming over once people stop calling... its going to get harder.....
but we will of course make it through....

I am at home for now... There going to be visitation, and service, and the burial.... We decided to have him Buried in Richmond. We know he would have wanted to be there.. Thats where he called home.

We are actually having him buried in A pocohauntus (i dont know how to spell it and I dont feel like looking it up) State Park. Its Beautiful... We bought 4 plots there so all of us could be buried together. I wish we would have bought a fifth for my husband because my parents said if we had children we would want to be buried with them... but i want to be buried next to my brother.

So the next couple of days will be crazy. But you know everything is okay, and will be okay. I find that im not having an extremely hard time because i am with so many other people and i have to be strong for them. I know my mom and dad need me to be as strong as possible.. 

I am going to miss district chorus, and all state auditions but it is fine...

For now I am going to go.

So i might be leaving here for a while. Dont delete me if i do...

Last night his oxygen was 60 which means they were giving him 60 precent oxygen and he was breathing fourty on his own. but hes up to 100 so hes not breathing on his own at all.

Of course there is still hope. but They arent really giving him a good chance its one of three things 1 being all the fluid he is holding.. which they are almost positive its not.. 2 the virus RSV he has but they were controlling it could have possibly gotten out of control. with it being this strong he has 50 50 chance. 3 being some respiratory problem i forget the name. but pretty much where the lungs lose there elasticity and dont work.. and there other stuff to that. and theyve never had a bone marrow transplant patient survive that. 

but you know theres always Hope, and of course im not going to be pessimistic about this.. because well he is my brother and i would never hope the worst for him.

God I feel like a dumbass... 

I dont even know.. and i hate how my mom can make me feel so small and rediculous all the way from richmond.. 

She says she just wants my dad to come home put the house on the market just have me doll the house up as nice as i can and just sell it for what we can get without fixing it up because she wants to be able to go home at night when she leaves the hospital instead of to an apartment. 
Which isnt going to happen but i almost wish it would. Im so ready to leave here. Ill just live with someone for a while until i graduate...

They took Kevin off the ventilator and onto some other machine but he does all the breathing.. well he just stopped breathing.. he couldnt handle it. So now he is back on the ventilator.. Hes been unconcious for so long that his muscles have stopped working so once he wakes up he will have to have physical therapy to learn to walk and write again, and he will have to have respritory therapy too.
He has some virus called RSV its common in babies.. and it can be serious for them since they dont have immune systems.. same idea for kevin...

Hes been coughing up blood and now hes unconcious...

theres still hope though 


EDIT
I just dont get it.. they are starting to think that kevins heart isnt working properly and thats why hes been so bad off... the last time they did an organ check his heart was in fine condition his liver is what was having troubles... 

So im just sitting here waiting for my mom to call me with results and stuff..

I feel like a shitty sister.. i feel like I should be there. My parents wont let me. 

It sucks that my brother is unconsious and has a machine breathing for him.. but its like atleast now hes not struggling to breath like he has been.


I dont know i just dont get it.. 
but i have to go clean.. the maid is coming tomorrow
UPDATE.
They found out it an infection.. they dont know if its of the heart or the lungs or what.. just know its an infection. and basically they told us theres hope but to be realistic about how high the mortality rate is when you get an infection with a bone marrow transplant. 
They said all they can do is pump antibiotics in him and hope that his immune system kicks in..."

Kevin went in the hospital today.. He had surgery to put his port back in so he can get pretransplant Chemo.. and the on Saturday he will have his second Bone marrow transplant.. he also had a chest catheter put in.. and apparently its just been bleeding and bleeding nonstop so they have to figure that one out....

So he will be in the hospital for 1 month then he has to live in isolation for 100 days with a care taker (my mom) then he has to come home for 3 months to continue recovery.....
and then we hope that he will be in remission after all that.. but since he wasnt in remission after the first transplant we are scared yet very hopeful...


So once again ill be living alone...  last time it was only 2 months but this transplant is more harsh so i could be living alone for 4 to 6 months this time... well my dad will be home sometimes... when work allows him to be... but my mom will be with kev....

so i have a lot to do and take care of.. ill try to update and comment more once things settle down some...

I have my film here.. and looking at them there is deffinately some sinus disease... but not tooo much.
I dont think that i am going to be needing surgery.. which is good. because its a very painful surgery...
but there is one thing that worries me a little.. but im assuming its nothing.. and if it is something the doc will tell me.. i dont know how to describe what it is.. a mass.. probably a cyst or a polyp...



So kevin got his results today.. His cancer is not gone but it is better... which is disappointing because they wanted him in remission (no cancer) before he went into his second transplant... its his best hope for a cure.. but they cant put him in remission..
so hes going into the hospital January 3rd and he will have the bone marrow transplant on the 7th of January... and we will keep our fingers and toes crossed that this kicks cancers ass and he is cured...
but he will be in the hospital for 1 to 2 months then he will have to live in an apartment for 3 months with a care taker (my mom) and unlike the last transplant.. he will have to come home for 3 months after the first 3 months... 

this transplant is much more harsh because it is somebody elses cells where the first time it was his own cells.. 

So yep...

thats my news for you...

"event","i am so alone right now. 
it's so quiet, and i think i like it 
but i also am considering the possibility 
that at this point alone has become the exact 
same as lonely and on most occasions one does 
not like to be lonely."

"event","I just want to make the world a better place.

As I was filling out my applications for college, one of the questions on one of the various forms was ""What is your goal in life?'"" I immediately knew the answer, and I told my mother exactly what I was planning on writing:

""to make people happy.""

She told me that was trite.
I ended up writing something much more complicated and career oriented.

But you know what? It may have been trite, but at least it was true."

"event","I figured out what my problem is... Whenever someone gets excited about something.. i get very unexcited... i dont know why.. maybe subconciously im trying to ruin thier good mood.. but thatd be shitty..

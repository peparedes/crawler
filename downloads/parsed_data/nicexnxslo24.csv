Friday after my game i went to the movies nad marissa joined me....we saw Fever Pitch, it was realllyyy cute.  Then we came home at like 1 and went to bed.  Then on saturday morning we woke up at 11, ate breakfast, then like went back to sleep til 2.  Then my dad took marissa home and i got a slurpe, yum.  Then my dad had to go to a wedding and my brother and me went to my cuzins house.  I did my homework and it took like all night.  Then this morning we rode bikes up to 7-11 and me being the blonde i am i dropped mine.  Then we played some basketball on like a 6 foot net.  It was fun, i won of course, lol. (it helps that im a lil taller then my brother)  Then i came back to my dads and had a headache so i went in the hot tub for a lil, but it was only 99 degrees so i turned it up.  then i took a shower and put my pjs on and watched like 10 episodes of Strange Love.  And i still have my headache and im going to eat dinner. Comment if your weekend was as boring as mine.

I had math, foods and english homework.  I wrote my essy then i relized i forgot my math in school.....that was nice.  Soccer was alright...it wasnt too bad, compared.

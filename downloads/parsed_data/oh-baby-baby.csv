"event","I bought an elliptical, it was a good deal too.  I love it.  Pretty much going on it everyday, I hope I lose about 600 pounds, that would be amazing.  Today wasn't so great and I haven't been in the best of moods for the past couple days.  I hate getting in moods where one thing can make me cry for hours or just make me feel really depressed.  It's cool, nope.

I just want to spend the rest of my life in my bed either reading, watching John Cusack movies, or watching Law&Order svu.  People could just come over my house and watch movies with me.  Would that be okay?  I'm just joking, a girl can dream though.

I can't wait to go to college, maaaaad boys.  All the good boys in Nashua are either, too old, too young, taken, or gay.  God damnnnn."

School is pretty much over, Friday was the last day of classes.  I'm only taking 2 finals because the other ones were just projects, I still have to go to school on those days though.  I can't wait to get the hell out of Poulin's class forever.  I'm going to miss my photography class more than anything.  My little Kevy-wevy is growing up so fast and Marissa is moving to Florida after school ends.  This year has been rocky, but I met some awesome people.

Amanda and I leave for Europe in 14 days!  I'm so excited, but I know I'm going to get so home sick.  I'm going to miss everyone, especially Jamie and Cassie.  Ahhh, I love them.  I'm pretty much calling them everyday while I'm gone.

"event","I haven't been myself lately.  I get mad at little things, but I don't say anything and then it builds up.  I snap at people.  I cry all of time, at the drop of a hat, for no reason.  I feel like things are spinning out of control at times and I don't know how to stop them.  I want to keep my friends close to me, not push them away.  I also want to cut somethings/people out of my life that are just completely fake and only pretend to give a shit about me.  I'm not a mean person, although I act it sometimes.  Mostly it's a front, or just a way to take my emotions out in the only way I know how.  I wasn't brought up to deal with anger or frustration.  My Mom holds it inside until she can't take it anymore and my Dad just snaps at people, I have his bad temper.  I need life skills.  I need to get my life back on track.  I need someone to love and someone who will love me.  I need to try harder in school.  I need to try to be happy.  I need to stop crying for no reason.  I'm stronger than this, and I need to start showing it.  This probably doesn't make sense to anyone.


I also have a crush and I hope it goes somewhere because he is definitely worth it.  He makes me smile and doesn't treat me like shit, I'd say that's a good start.


This is random and out of character of me, but someone's birthday was on April 12, I wanted to say Happy Birthday.  After all we've gone through, I wouldn't change anything.  I hope you are happy wherever you are."

"event","You how people always say that bad things happen in threes?  The whole triad thing, oh Mrs. Lessard.  Well, I am nearing the double digits, so whoever said that, is full of crap.  This semester had been one big bad thing.  Don't get me wrong, good things have come along with the bad, meeting new people, becoming closer to old ones, and every once in a whike there is a spectaclar day.  It all started with me dropping my Mom's camera, it completely broke.  We had to get a new one because I have photo.  Then, I was backing out of a parking space after school and some kid came flying behind me, I didn't see him, and I didn't stop.  Nothing happened to my car, but I had a major panic attack and couldn't drive for like a week and a half.  Then, I'm backing out of my driveway, and I get a flat tire.  I go to get it fixed, leave the place, another flat tire!  In less than 24 hours, two flat tires!  It turns out the spring in my car was broken and it punctured both tires.  I come to find out, my car has been on recall since the two weeks after I bought it.  Great Ford Motor Company, let me tell you.  I even bought it from a Ford Dealership, but ""they don't do the recalls.""  So basically, I could have died if my tire popped on the highway.  I would have lost control of the car, and with the speed on the highway, I could have died.  Major lawsuit, damnit, I would have been set for life.  There was another recall on my car also, for a light or something, no big deal but it was big enough for a recall.  Then, yesterday after school I rearended this girl.  The guy stopped short in front of her and I slammed on my breaks, but it was partially my fault too.  She was so nice about it and nothing was wrong with our cars so we just drove off.  Basically, my car is a tank and nothing will ever hurt it.  I thought I was going to have another panic attack, but I preceded to laugh hysterically for the next 10-15 minutes.  So how many is that?  Camera, accident, flat tire, flat tire, recall, recall, accident.  That is 7, hm, things seem to happen in double for me.  Wow, that was long.

On a lighter note, I decided to make a purse, because I've looked everywhere and the exact one I want is nowhere to be found.  I'm also going to Italy, Athens, and a few other places for 2 weeks over summer vacation.  I'll miss everyone.  I've never been away from home for that long without my parents.  What else has happened?  Amanda turned 18, she got an adorable tatoo and her belly button pierced.  I hung out with her and Jess last night, Rockingham Mall I love you.  I bought a shirt and some sunglasses.  I saw Conrad and Jon last night too, gosh I adore Jon.<3

This vacation is going to suck, another U.S. History project and my Mom wants to visit a bazillion colleges.  So basically I won't even have time to relax.  When the last vacation ended, I needed a vacation from my vacation.  I can't wait until summer, I want to make the best of this one, not hold back, and do somethings out of my comfort zone.

Today:  Errands: bank, cleaning my car, cleaning, maybe quick old navy stop, then a meeting with Rosemary for my project.
Tonight: Something with Jamie and probably sleeping over her house.

Let me know if you would like to hang out over vaca, my Cassie is leaving me. :("

<P>Sunday morning, at 5 o'clock, my cell phone rang.&nbsp; I answered and it was Pat, he wanted to hang out.&nbsp; Yes, he wanted to hang out at 5 o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; Well, I gave in.&nbsp; He came picked me up and we left.&nbsp; We just drove around for an hour or so.&nbsp; He told me how he misses me and he was sorry that he fucked up before.&nbsp; He said he was basically crawling back and that he wanted to be with me again.&nbsp; It's hard not to believe what someone is telling you, when it's exactly what you want to hear.&nbsp; We kissed, whatever, I'm a stupid girl.&nbsp; Anyways, he dropped me off.&nbsp; I go to the door that I left unlocked, and sure enough it was locked.&nbsp; I had unlocked the dead bolt, but I hadn't checked if the handle was locked.&nbsp; Obviously, I freaked out.&nbsp; I called Amanda because I knew she would be up (she's a manager at BK and she opens at 6:30).&nbsp; I took the screens off some of the windows on the first floor, sure enough, they were all locked.&nbsp; Amanda picked me up and brought me to work with her.&nbsp; I helped her out and managed to come up with a believable story.&nbsp; I called my mom and told her that Amanda and her boyfriend had gotten into a big fight and she came by to talk before work, but I got locked out.&nbsp; My mom started screaming at me, calling me an idiot and telling me that I should have just knocked on the door until she woke up.&nbsp; Yes, I should have, but I didn't because I had no idea what I was going to tell her.&nbsp; She came and picked me up from BK and told me&nbsp;I was grounded for the rest of vacation.&nbsp; AWESOME!</P>
<P>Basically, I have thousands of thoughts running through my head.&nbsp; I have no idea what I want right now and I don't know what to do.&nbsp; Is it fair to forgive someone who hurt you so badly before?&nbsp; Who knows.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Here's the real story.""> </P>
<P>All I know is, I am going to die.&nbsp; I miss Jamie, a lot.&nbsp; She is pretty much my life and I will die without seeing her for a week, trust me I will.&nbsp; The longest we've gone without hanging out is probably, a day?&nbsp; At the most!</P>

1st- English with Mrs. Lessard.  She seems nice, but we already have so much work to do, at least I have Cait in that class!
2nd- Calculus with Mrs. Tessier.  I like her a lot, she's nice and she actually cares if we understand what she teaches us.  I'm sad because Sam sits across the freaking room though!
3rd- Photography with Mrs. Mclean, she's really nice and it seems like it's going to be fun.  Lots of cute boys and Kevin makes me laugh.
4th- US History with Miss. Poulin.  She's crazy, but nice.  I got Cassie, Manda, Leah, Trinh and everyone I love, haha.

I wish Erin could have switched into my Photo class but Mr. O'Leary sucks ass.  I miss my freaking Physics table!  Such good times in that class.  I also miss Ducas, I never thought I would say that.  His class wasn't scary though, we did the same thing everyday and I always knew what to expect.

Thursday: Psychology final was so easy.  Precalc final was so freaking hard.

Friday: Spanish was pretty bad since I didn't study.  Physics was a joke mostly, but hard.  I forgot to bring in my physics book and had to pretend like the one I picked up from across the room was mine.  Needless to say, I now have my very own physics book.  After school went to Wendy's with Jamie, Rob, and Jill.  Went to the mall for a bit and to look for a camera.  Packed and house sat with Jamie, her mom, and sister.  Got like no sleep.

Saturday: Got up early, went to get her sister's oil changed, out to lunch, old navy, home.  Cleaned and did laundry then went out to amherst street for my freaking bird.  Went to Jamie's, went to Hannaford's, holy shit facking hottie there.  We were going to see a movie but Eric came over instead, then I slept over.

We stayed there for awhile, then dropped Cody and Yutaro off and got Travis and Gary some presents.  Went back to Travis' work, dropped them off at BK on main street, Jamie hit Jamie's car (sounds funny).  Hahah I freaking love her.

Saturday: Went out with my Mom in the morning.  Picked Jamie up and met up with Travis.  Then Jamie and I met Rob and Eric at Panera.  We went to Blockbuster and rented a couple movies.  Went back to my house, watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.  Then we met Cody and his friend at Bicentenntial, ehh.  Left, picked up Jamie's stuff.  She slept over and we were supposed to sneak out but my Dad is crazy.

Sunday:  Woke up, had some waffles, watched Wimbledon, dropped Jamie off.  Hung around and had a nice chat with Kayla.  Then Amanda got out of work and we went bowling with Veera and her boyfriend, Matt, and Jon.  Job gave me back luck, but I kicked his ass anyways.

Also, if you want to repeat the lines from the movie, at least make sure you're saying them correctly.</P>

<P>That's all.</P>"

"event","The last few weeks have been interesting.  It's weird, I don't know why.  Somedays are hard, sometimes for no reason in particular.  Somedays are really good and I have lots of fun not worrying about anything, today was one of those days.  It's pretty amazing when you have a friend that you can say litterally anything to.  I love cleaning off my car and not being able to feel my hands, then hanging around in Cody's driveway with Jamie, Cody, and Ian.  Sledding was amazing tonight, even if Jamie was screaming bloody murder, but I was right there with her.  We never did make it to that fence, but it doesn't matter.  Some nights I just forget everything, school, boys, and drama.  It only takes one person or one conversation to bring me back to reality.  I know my decision hurt someone, but I stand by it and there's no turning back.

Tomorrow night, madddd funnnn.

"event","<P><FONT size=2>What can I say about 2004?&nbsp; It sucked.&nbsp; I should have know by the start.&nbsp; The very first day of 2004, my grandmother died.&nbsp; The rest of the year was as heartbreaking as that day.&nbsp; Growing apart from friends, other deaths, stupid bitches, various boys, breakups, and general drama.&nbsp; I hope that 2005 is a different story, because I couldn't take another year like 2004.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>This vacation has been good.&nbsp; I spent tons of money on clothes that I love.&nbsp; I hung out with Jamie a lot and we visited Travis a lot at work and hung out with him.&nbsp; I'd say spending 2 hours in a cold parking garage with 4 boys is a good time.&nbsp; We pretty much froze/laughed our asses off making poems, singing, and driving around the parking garage.&nbsp; We started off the new year at H&amp;M, so it was a good time.</FONT></P>

I got a haircut, not completely different but I like it.  I also went against most of my beliefs and bought a GREEN tank top.  It was only to match a cute sweatshirt, but I still own a green tank now.

"event","This weekend was a good one, one of the best in awhile, besides my spanish project stressing me out.

--Friday: Went out to dinner with Jamie, got ripped off by a damn waitress.  Then, back to her house to exchange pressies.  I freaking love my Napoleon shirt, I will be rocking that shit tomorrow and I am wearing my wonderful jammie pants right now!  Damn I love that girl!

--Saturday:  Tweaked out in the morning, because I was stressed about my project, but my brother helped me.  Then went out to dinner with Cait and went to bell ringing for the salvation army at Sam's Club.  We had so much fun dancing and singing and stuff, plus the guy came to pick up the bucket early.  Then Cait and I decided to go to the mall because we didn't want to go home.  We hung around with Manda and Jess, even though they ditched us a couple times to buy me presents. :)  It was a fun night!

--Saturday Night: While we were bell ringing, my brother called my cell phone and asked me when my parents were getting home, cause there was a little accident.  The stove in my kitchen has two burners, like every other stove, but there is also a grill on the other side, which is normally covered  by a metal grill cover.  Apparently, the grill got turned on, the grill heated up, and the grill cover heated up.  On top of the girll cover was a little can of tomato sauce, and my george foreman grill.  The can of tomato sauce got so hot, that it exploded.  It sprayed burned tomato sauce all over the ceiling above, some on the rug, and all over the cabinets.  For those of you who have a foreman grill, the drip tray was completely melted on top of the grill cover and the bottom of the grill was completely melted.  Needless to say, my foreman grill is no longer.  The weird thing is, the nobs for the grill are not easily turned on and when the grill does turn on, the stove fan turns on.  So it was almost impossible for it to be turned on and left on.  Who knows what happened!

--Today:  I have to memorize my spanish paper to present tomorrow, I got some other homework, and I will probably go to bed rediculously early tonight and I love it!


That's all folks."

"event","I'm sorry, I really am.  I know I don't act like it sometimes and you may not think that I care, but I do.  I care so much.  You have been such a huge part of me for such a long time, I don't know how it will feel to be without you.  I just can't be with you, I can't keep doing this to the both of us.

These last two weeks haven't been easy for me.  I've cried so much.  I am sick of being sad and depressed.  I need to get my life together and feel like I have control over something.

On a lighter note, thank you for my pressies Jamie! I love them so much.  You better watch out for my Napoleon shirt, cause it's hott shit.  We'll be matching with Napoleon wear and jammies.  I love you darling!

I'm just glad that I have friends I can count on. <3"

<P>Saturday: Went out to breakfast with my Mom.&nbsp; Then we went to Pearl Vision to pick out new glasses for her.&nbsp; Went to Old Navy and Modell's for the Red Sox DVD and a shirt for my brother.&nbsp; I went over Jamie's around 4 for a jewelry party, we ate a lot and listened to 80's music, awesome time.&nbsp; Her friend Spud came over later, then I left around 11.</P>
<P>Today:&nbsp; Woke up late and decided I should start my Spanish project.&nbsp; I&nbsp;almost started crying because I started to look up info on my guy and there was nothing, but I found some good info.&nbsp; Then my Mom and I went to the Nashua Public Libaray for some books about my painter.&nbsp; I finally got a library card and I got this...</P>

<P>Later Today: I looked out the window in my kitchen today and there was the biggest squirrel that I have ever seen in my whole life!&nbsp; It had to be pregnant, unless it is just morbidly obese.&nbsp; I &nbsp;ran upstairs and got my digital camera.&nbsp; &nbsp;I took some pictures, they kind of suck because it was through a window, but deal with it.</P>

Went out to dinner and movie with Jamie and Kayla last night.  We went to see the Grudge, even though Kayla thought we were going to see the Incredibles, hahah sorry Kayla!  Well Jamie and Kayla walked out about 45 minutes into it, and then I walked out afterwords.  It was scary, but being alone in a theater surrounded by strange people made me even more scared.  Then we went to a highly populated area, do get the movie out of our heads.  Then, I got to come home to an empty house.  Soooo, anyone want to go see the Grudge with me?  I swear I'll finish the movie this time!

On another note, I haaaate sundays.

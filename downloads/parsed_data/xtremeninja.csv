"event","Ok kiddies, droppin some updates on yo ass........first it dates back to weds.  after seeing some guy on his bike get backed up into by a VW was hilarious, and then some dude getting owned by the Campus Connectors with this backpack stuck in the door and shit, good times.  Went and saw my Jess, which turned out to be kickin it at her house, hittin up the Boston Market for food, Mall Of America walking, and the back to her crib for more kickin it and talking.  She dropped a bomb on me, she said i was one of the greatest things that has happened to her and she realizes what she has been missing out on from other relationships......wow.......what do I say to that?  Basically that hit me like a ton of bricks, knocked me on my ass like Dave Graf running into the wall in Detroit, and made me smile ear to ear, kool-aid grin type of smile.  I mean damn does that make you feel good.  Just hearing that made me just realize how wonderful this relationship really is and really is going to be a fantasic one.  and not one of those ""fantastic"" like i thought Carrie was or other people, like I mean this is a feeling that has NEVER been in me before with any girl, and seeing that it is such a good feeling, I know that it is a great thing.  Just walking on clouds man, everything is lookin up Joey =)

anywho ummmmm, classes are good, killed my psych quiz again, finished that bitch in 5 mins and walked out, got those essays on lock down! anyways, as K-Dub would say, keep it janky!"

"event","Yeah so i figured i would update this bitch because i haven't done it in a while, lemme tell yas whats all been going down for a while.  The bish is bagged, but the driverside airline has sprung a leak.....fuck......but gettin that fixed next sunday, along with my shocks and switches and then i am rockin full force bitches! umm school is going great, doing well in all of my classes and am gonna keep it that way.  prospects for a house next year are lookin mighty fine, keep ya informed about that so you all know which house to come kick it at on the weekends!  The relationship status is still with Jess, and ya know what I absolutly could not be happier, life is just perfect with her here.....this next story will show ya how amazing she really is (well in my eyes anyways,  if any of you think differently well boo urns on you!)

So last friday kids, yours truly took a pretty nasty turn for the worse while drinking.....must remind myself that i am not back in highschool and can't party like a rockstar anymore.  Do the following math.......9 beers + 1 Bloody + a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels that I slammed in like 30 seconds.....that equals me hitting the floor and blackin out.  apparently i was pukin like a motherfucker, had a nose bleed going and the eyes were rollin back into my head, not cool at all.  Had everyone worried and might have to take me to a hospital, but i was a trooper and survived.  Jess stayed with me till about 1 am to make sure i was alright, she headed out cause she had to go to the Michaels art/craft store to go work.  Now she felt kinda bad about not stayin the night, but hey i completly understand, she had to go get work and get paid, isn't easy payin for school and shit if you aren't workin.  But ya know what, she stuck by me while i was out cold, it woulda been easy to just say ""well fuck this, i'm out"" no she hung around to make sure i was alright, how awesome is that, does that not show she cares? and she also said in my passed out sleeping state i looked cute......for Gods sake i was puking, bleeding, and laying on my floor in only my boxers and i looked cute still?  Now that is true love right there my friends, i went through hell and she was still by my side through it all, that is amazing and i can't thank her enough.......THANKS HUN!!!  Also mad thanks to everyone else who carried me and held my head up while puking or contributed in keepin me alive.

Well thats pretty much it, gonna watch the superbowl tonight, GO PANTHERS i guess, ummmm keep it janky (as K-Dub would say) who gave me a sweet phone call last night, good times hearin about him keepin it alive in Raytown while I am up here.  alright I have updated, you have read, now you can continue with your lives."

Wow, I gotta start learning to use you more instead of ya, but thats something I will work on, I promise, but don't let it fool you, it means the same thing, just spelled differently.....ok enough explaining my uses of ya and you...........so yeah definatly dropped that history class like it was hot, and picked up fundamentals of music to go in place of it, score! Gonna use my knowledge in there to help me learn how to spin some records.  Gonna have us some fat beats for the parties at our house next year.  Yeah thats right, we got a house planned and lemme tell ya, it is gonna be fat, fatter than Violent J in his good ol days, fatter than Big Pun, fatter than Yokozuna...........trust me, it'll be sweetness.  Aight so today was pretty rockin, just went to class, chilled, ya'll know how it works.  I am mad excited for the weekend, gonna get that bish hoppin on the front end, drivin back up here and hittin switches like it ain't nothin.  

Now last night I had a very deep and meaningful conversation with Jess. (K-Dub maybe this can help ya out)......Day by day this girl gets better and better.  So last night we chatted it up, and it made me realize something, it seemed that when I would say I was in love with a girl, I think deep down I was on a whole different page than the other girl was, yeah sure it was there, but I think I was more deeper into, actually I know I was......Now after talkin to Jess last night, I had like a enlightenment.....finally.........a girl who is thinkin along the same lines as I am!!!! It is madness!!  We think alot alike along the lines of this crazy thing called love, it is about growing with eachother and learning about the world through eachothers eyes, it is a team, ya need two to make it work and when ya are thinkin along the same lines as eachother it is marvelous.......now many of you are probablly saying ""Joey, joo dumbshit, ya only date this girl a month and you are talkin about being deep and lovin and shit, man you don't know shit""  Well ya know what, I think for the first time in my life I am thinking straight.  It is something about her, just her attitude on life, the randomness, the gentleness, just her as a whole that is just so spectacular that makes it difficult not to fall in love with her.  She puts this feeling through me (and did in the past when we didn't date) that makes it feel so good to be me and to be with her, she is like a drug.....the love she gives to you is so addicting and you just want more and more cause it makes ya feel this bliss inside of you.  For once in my life I think I am actually finding the real meaning of this complicated love thing, and being with her, it isn't so complicated anymore........it is just an experience that you wrap up inside of you and hold it close to you.......hahaha i am becomming a babbling fool right now, but i dunno how much better i can explain it.....plain and simple, Jess rocks, definatly one of the best things to ever happen to me in such a long time.  To her, I say thank you, you mean the world to me, and I love you with all my heart and soul..........................

Ok wow, that was alot, but I needed to say it, cause just as of late all these different feelings and emotions have been going through me it is unreal, and i am lovin every second of it.

check back tomorrow kids, there will be an update as always"

Well now you are all caught up on the past of my life, so now maybe ya'll know where i am commin from and shit, but i'll put it in simple terms for you all, i am damn happy where i am right now and ain't a damn thing gonna change that, well.......there are a variety of things that could, but i don't forsee them happening anytime soon.  I mean I got an academic career that is starting out pretty damn good, got a great g/f who i am starting to develop a great relationship with, now don't get me wrong, it is great how it is now but i can see that when i spend more time with her it is going to develop into something fantastic cause she is such a fantastic person who does all the right things for me and makes me feel absolutly perfect, just like a non-stop natural high sort of thing........thanks hun!......so yeah i could continue bragging about her, which i am sure many of you don't want to hear, but lemme tell ya, it is going to be pretty much all the entries, so live wit it.......and to you jess, you know you are gonna get earfulls of me telling you how great ya are =)..............so yeah classes were decent, i think i am gonna enjoy this creative writing shit sounds like it'll be a rockin good time.......so yeah i can't think of too much more to say........and yeah k-dub is right, why do some of joo have AIM?? all it says is where you are away to......although i do fall victim to this as well, but at least i give detailed aways letting you know where you can find me, and if anything CALL ME MOTHERFUCKERS"

"event","aight so no more bullshittin around, time for a real update

so back to it all, time for the summer following the senior year of highschool, i was single for a while and then started talkin to my friend Jen Nelson, we went and saw the 2 Fast 2 Furious movie......go Skyline! anyways, we hung out alot and just decided to hook up, we were pretty close but nothin serious ever really came of it
but i must say i am pretty good friends with her now and her family, ahhh rockin good times over at ""Auntie Frans"" house =)

so many of you must be wondering about Carrie, well i decided to throw it into here because it seemd to fit the best.  Well me and her met way back summer going into 7th grade, met her at my buddy Daytons piggie roast, we hit it off mad crazy good a decided to try and date......but.......she lived in MI and me in WI, i broke it off because it wasn't easy and hey, we were 13 for God's sake!  So we would see eachother the summers after and just talk and realize more and more how much we liked eachother but couldn't do it because of the distance.  Well for a while we didn't see eachother because i was dating Niki and we didn't make it out to a roast and the summer before i was doin somethin else........anyways, this last summer i made a random appearance to Daytons house and surprised the hell out of her, we talked, hung out the following week and just fell for eachother.  We got up to school and tried the whole going out thing again because we felt our love was true.  Well all was well, Thanksgiving rocked but shortly after we broke up, she felt it was too hard with school and the distance, and when we got to see eachother it was too short a period of time, but fear not, we are still friends, we talk every now and again.

So now that I am up at school, who is the girl in my life?  Well lemme tell ya, last semester I met this girl in my journalism class, she sat next to me on the first day and i complimented the plugs in her ears.  gradually we started to talk and shoot the shit and then just led to goofing around in class, hey ya had to kill 2.5 hours somehow right? so i kinda started to feel attracted to her once we talked more and got to know eachother better, we cruised downtown and went to uptown and saw Lost In Translation.  We would always shoot the shit in class, I would hear her interesting stories of the weekend and i would share mine as well.  Well, I told her about how Carrie and I broke up and she felt bad about it and was there for me.  Don't get me wrong, the Carrie break-up hurt, but I also saw it as an opportunity to pursue this relationship.  We came back to my room after the final, hung out and had a few drinks, we spent the entire night through the morning just talking and getting to know eachother better, she listened to me and took in everything i said, it was really cool.  We started to go out the night and I was bummed out because X-mas break was comming and she was gonna be in Miami for 2 weeks and I thought for sure she would find some hot guy down there, but she promised me she wouldn't break my heart and ya know what, she didn't which meant ALOT to me (seeing as to how other people I know weren't going to feel bad if they messed around with other guys while in Florida).......oh this girls name, her name is Jessica and she is a super sweet girl, it is fun, i can give her shit and she will give it right back to me, very awesome if ya ask me.  She is a real sweetie who I love to death, she means the world to me and I wouldn't give that up for anything.  Just feelings of pure bliss everyday, what more could I ask for??? Nothing really, cause everything I ever wanted or needed is all within Jess and that makes this relationship absolutly wonderful........love ya sweetheart =)

yeah more tomorrow.....first day of classes.....now go to sleep all of you, well mainly K-Dub and Niki who read this, but it is late now go to bed!"

"event","Aight so now you all got the low down with Niki, so lets go back to after we broke up.  I started talking to Lindsey Lipor again after some shit between us went down in the past we were again on speaking terms.  She was home for Thanksgiving and I said ""hey lets meet up at Applebees and have some dinner"" Her good friend Ms.Locke came with her, hey it is all good, more the merrier.  Anyways, we hung out alot and decided to start going on, now you are thinkin, yeah that a boy Joey, right back in the saddle of the relationship horse........yeah, I jumped the gun on it though.  We went out for like a month and then I broke it off with her, to this very day I still feel bad about it, because I was a dick and completely fucked her over, she has heard it many-a-times......I am really sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you at all.  So I then remained single for a lil while.

Being caught up in the whole single life again I was thinkin this was pretty pimptastic, me and Kevin were jockin the pom squad hardcore, and they were jockin us right back, so they said ""hey come do the guy girl dance with us"" naturally we said ""ohh hells yeah!"" so we learned the routine, became acquainted with the whole squad and did our dance.  Kevin was partners with Josie Michna (who still has our two big ass poster board things the squad made for us! and Kevins goat) and I was with Stephanine Skaarnes.  It was good times and I started developing a crush on Steph and so after a while we decided to go out, on Valentines Day for that matter.  We were togther but it didn't last long, soon the relationship dwindled down and out, i heard some shit, she heard some shit......her whole group of friends at the time was just too much to handle so I called it off.  I remained a single lovin fool for the rest of the year, woo woo!

"event","well i would say for the most part we are on good terms.  we talk every now and again.....during the past summer we kicked it for a while more towards the end and it was like feelings were comming back, which at first worried me but then i got used to em and they felt pretty good.  ya know, i don't care what anyone says, she is a really cool and great person.  did we have bad times during our relationship? oh sure, but then again find me a couple who hasn't........but i am not going to totally forget the good times we had either, she was the first true love of my life and ya can't forget that.  I know it might have seemed like i was doggin her in the last entries, might still be a lil bitter, but ya know i look back, would i have not done somethings i did, hell yeah, do i wish i wouldn't have said somethings, damn right.........would i have taken this relationship back at all? no way in hell. Niki if ya are reading this, thanks for the memories and i hope we can keep in touch, don't be afraid to drop a brotha a line now and again.........

"event","wow, wowie wow wow.......I must say that Mr.Favre made a rookie mistake.  But hey, ah well. so anyways lets get into the story shall we

so yeah lets roll on.  So yeah man, me and niki were a damn team.  We went to dances, had good times.  We got into arguements like any couple would.......then it seemed like we were getting into alot of em in a really short amount of time.  It seemed like I would get yelled at alot for shit i didn't do or just something little.  Or hell it would reflect back upon my family like if my mom didn't like her.  Now granted she would do and or say things that would piss me off, but I never said anything for fear of her ripping my head off or breaking up with me. Now don't think that I was all innocent and shit, hell I know I did tons of things that pissed her off or wrong, nobody is perfect. edit.  The relationship pretty much stayed this way for a while.  We came to our one year relationship and things started to pick up again, we weren't fighting as much and things were cool.  Then it all started up again with the fighting..,...we were both in Minnesota and a lil arguement broke out.  she then sent me an e-mail telling me she was just upset because we couldn't meet up.  Then a week later she found a note on her car from some dudes saying they wanted to kick it and talk cars with her because they liked her car.  On tuesday she went to go hang out with em and felt more attracted to them, I called her up and found out that things were over with.....I couldn't sleep at night, missed some school and just felt God awful........I felt like I had been left for a fucking note, but this will furthermore get explained tomorrow."

Ok, so on with this whole thing......I was feeling pretty shitty about life, was a lil bit better because I let out alot of shit to my parents about life and what was bothering me.  I get a phone call one night from my buddy Mike Joost who attended the Prarie highschool along with a few of my other buddies.  He asked me if I had a girlfriend, and wanted to know if I wanted one.  So I talked a lil bit to Niki on the phone and had it all planned out to meet up at Sausage Kitchen after school.  I got there and remembered who she was (saw her before at dances and when I shadowed) and was like ""damn, this hot girl is interested in me, good deal"" So we talked, went to Mikes, chilled and ended up as me going out with her at the end of the night.  Fast forward a month and I wanted to break up with her and I told her I did because I thought she liked someone else and whatnot, she cried and called me back and I felt horrible and realized she was a good person and I was like ""man, wtf was I thinkin?"" so we got back togther.  Those first couple of months were fuckin bad ass man.  She was so nice to me, always wanted to be close, it was just all around good feelings, we had a rockin good time at formal dances (granted I almost kicked the shit out of two guys the night of one dance at Prarie) we would go out to dinner, hang out, movies all of that good stuff... Spend countless hours on the phone and pretty much attached at the hip.  She really did give me and honest reason to start going to church again and believe that there was a God, she also was a anti drug for me, I still give her mad props to this day for keepin me clean, she really did influence alot of it.  I thought everything was peachy fuckin keen.  This was also the first time I felt that I was truly in love, and I knew that I was this time because never before did I feel like this with a girl, and no girl has ever been with me for more than a month or so.......so something had to have been good! Yeah, those were the days.

So yeah, that story will continue later on.............I said it was a saga, not just a one page deal............greedy fuckers.........=)"

"event","Aight, here is where we talk about our favorite subject, the ladies of Joey's life.

So yeah, freshman year I was going out with the manish like lady Sam Falcone, yeah what the hell was wrong with me, well she broke up with me only to go out with Matty K, she pretty much used me to get closer to a buddy of mine, pretty stale but whatever, she prolly has a bigg dick that I do.  Then came Stacy Schroeder........man wtf.......I had a mad infatuation with that girl, I have no clue why though.  She was cool as fuck at the start of it all but then it got stale real quick.  All she did was talk about Dominic Menghe and other guys in choir and shit, insulted me, hell even slapped me....then she asks me if I was cheating on her....ugh......when she broke up with me, I think it was one of the better days of my life, never was I so happy to be single again.  So yeah, I remained single the rest of the year, me and Stacy talked mad shit about eachother, all good.  Don't forget Melissa Kass too, but that was short lived.

Soph--So I met Ashley Watson over the summer going into this year.  She was a cool ass chick, so nice to me and was real sweet, thought I meant the meaning of love, but more of an infatuation once again.....so we were togther for like 4 months, I started drivers ed and ended up meeting a chick from Prarie named Laura Nash.....basically broke Ashleys heart and went out with Laura, ugh......mad mistake there.  So yeah, went out with her for a week then realized she was a big whore and was like fuck it.  So here I am alone, Ashley hates me...ahhhh so yeah thats when i broke down, weed, caught etc etc......for the longest time I was in love with Kelly Wilson, but that never happened, ah well........more towards the end of the year I ended up hookin up with Niki.

ok, done for the night kids, the Niki saga is tommorow and prolly sunday"

"event","ok sorry to anyone who thought they would get to check out what i had all early like, lucky for joo, i can finish up the highschool era in all one night, my gift to you all.....then tomorrow is girls.....that will be like a 2-3 page entry.  anywho lets have at it.

freshman year--yeah not too much was going on here, thought I owned that school because I took German there in 8th grade.  Classes were kinda easy, Algebra killed me, soon began to feel pressure of comming from private school into public school should be kickin its ass type of thing.  But none the less, did a good job, played some football and did some track.  Met my soon to be closest friend and homeboy K-Dub (Kevin) in the health class.  Good times in there.

Sophomore year--here is the year where the shit hits the fan.  So yeah I had been feeling pretty bummed out.  That pressure I mentioned before was starting to get worse, I wasn't happy with myself and man shit just pretty much sucked the proverbial donkey balls.  I didn't think I was doing that well in school, thought the parents were all thinkin i was doing bad, I buckled under the pressure and mad depression I was going through and decided to hit up on the sweet sweet cheeba, reefer, weed, hash......you get the idea.  Yeah man, rockin good times, gettin stoned, eating, laughing, sleeping, throwing a big pot smokin party at the homestead when parents went to LaCrosse to visit Jenny.  So I get all cocky like and buy some shit in school, get busted, and I break down and fess up to my parents and whatnot about how and why, etc etc.  After this lil problem I ran into, I met a better crew of people to kick it with, knew I was doing good in school, and a third party that really changed me was Niki (To be mentioned more in detail later) So I finished this year off well.

Junior year--Hells yeah, K-Dub is in my Sociology class, we fucked around that entire period, I don't remember much from that class, but it is all good.  Me and him became alot closer this year, those two crazy juggalos always kickin it.  Was still with Niki and was happy, all was pretty good for the most part, still jammin to the sweet sounds of heavy metal.  Pretty uneventful year as to personal things really, just hanging out with Kevin taught me more to be me and not give a fuck bout what anyone else thought.

Senior year--So aight me and Kevin are pretty much attached at the hip, there was no doubt we were close.  Anytime Niki was out of town, it was a weekend with him.  Well me and Niki broke up (like I said man, it will be more in detail later) and it was hell to begin with.  Tears were shed, half day of school was missed, man I thought life was a shithole again, thought about going back to the bud smokin but K-Dub's crazy ways kept me straight..........and I turned to liquor.  I mean shit, when ya find out someone ya work with works at a liquor store and will hook ya up, you tend to go take advantage of it.  Parties were held.....Eddie puked in my kitchen......hey it was good times man, cept for that crazy bitch who was messin up my buddy.  Slowly I saw that shit happening and the summer after that year it was chaos.  Man he treated her like a damn queen and Stacy pretty much fucked him over hardcore, silent treatment, slappings, crazy attitude, the works man.....well I got my revenge on her, yeah man that shindig at my house where Eddie had no pillows, Stacy got a lil bit of her own from me, haha........but yeah, drunken sex is no good.  but yeah enough of talking about that mistake, public safety note:  Drinking and sex=shitty time.....never did I want/intend on that.......hell I think I was raped, but yeah we all make mistakes......anywho we graduated 03' woo woo

so yeah, highschool tossed me around and thanks to my buddies espically you Kev, I turned out to be who I am today, tomorrow begins the Saga of the women in my life......grab a bucket of popcorn and kick back for a while, cause it is on!"

"event","aight lil description of my day, got my airline and valves from Jason at Suicide Doors.......the process is slowly starting!! yeah work sucked the balls, everyone is back in Detroit and I am stuck back in the DC with some people I don't normally talk to all that much, but it is all good......so yeah, how about we continue this lil story

so yeah junior high....many people liked it, I hated it then grew to enjoy it and make it some of the better times of my life.  I mean I had that crazy fuck Dayton as a good friend, along with all the guys in the class, we were a crew, from nerdy to jock to preppy to skater we all kicked it.  The girls in our class, ummmm yeah.  It is like I had to be this goofy guy all the time, and hard to take serious (hell i would find it hard to take myself serious too at times) but it was rough, we always fought, man 8th grade year was alot of fights.  But hey wouldn't you be pissed if you were gettin yer ass handed to ya in a b-ball tourny and the chicks from your class were cheering for the other team.  Man WTF is up with that? pretty bogus.  So yeah, guys and girls had quarrels, guys dated gals from the other private schools in town which pissed them off because all of a sudden it was like ""hey, wheres our attention?""  at the end of it all, i had so much spite in me for a select few, that after the final dance after graduation, people were crying because they were sad to leave, i was crying because i was happy to get the fuck out! so yeah, that prolly doesn't explain much, but it was hell man.  but like i said earlier, the Manson helped me, along with other music of that time, Metal was growing on me and shaping me up........highschool is next..........."

"event","Aight whatup to all f the fellow readers out there......although i don't expect there to be much at this point in time, but whatever.  So I said I would drop some info/bombs, well ya'll ready?  Lets see, lets start out waaaay back in life, kind of the early turning point in my life.  As many may know (or not know) in the 3rd grade my aunt decided to take her own life with a 22 pistol.  Apparently there was a chemical imbalance in her brain, like she thought everyone was out to get her. (side note, one reason why I want to go into psychology, help people out who had my aunts issue).....ok back to it.  So with that news dropped on me and the family, it really made me grow up, made me realize this world isn't as friendly and carefree as it appears to be, this happy image is also burned in the mind of a kid who is in a private Cathloic school.  It was rough lemme tell ya, just so much anguish within the family, I felt like I had to be strong because I was a guy and had to be there to support the rest of the family (mainly mom, grandma, and my cousins) that event pretty much leads up to this day why I hold alot of my feelings in me, (but I am gettin better at that).  So at a young age, I feel I matured quickly.......So lets go through more of grade school a bit, I was always kinda picked on for being the biggest in the class, and in 6th grade I found my light, noneother than Marilyn Manson himself.  The cd Antichrist Superstar changed me.  His image, his opinion, his thoughts told me to say fuck what everyone else says, be who you want to be........yeah fuck ya'll who don't like me because of how I look, dress, talk, act whatever.  People have found the good in me and I am close to them, all you who judged and left.  Too bad you missed out on a chance to meet a cool guy......aight I am gonna go off more into a rant, so tomorrow we will continue this story of the grade school/junior high."

"event","Lemme tell you something right quick, if you plan on gettin one of these things, making up a password is the hardest thing to do! It gets mad strict on you.  Well I got the great idea to do one of these now through my buddy K-Dizzle, he's been droppin the proverbial bombs of information on people and hey I got some I can drop too, so hey what the hell why not go ahead and drop em.  2004 seems like a good year to get shit off my chest and we'll start it off right now.  As most of you know I am a big fan of writing, hell I love it (seeing that I can't draw for shit writing is my art form...........besides my truck) so let me give ya the lay out of this biotch, over the next few hours, days, weeks, whatever I will be fillin everyone in on what has happened in my life, whats going on, and what I plan to do, now many of you can prolly say you know where I am comming from and understand why I am the way I am.  Now I might say some shit in here that may piss some people off, make em cry, make em laugh, hell I might start doing cartwheels along with a song and dance routine you never know.  So I welcome you all to my wonderful world, hope ya can learn something from it."

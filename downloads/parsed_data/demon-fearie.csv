<br />YOU! For some reason you gave up caring about
<br />things. You use to be warm and loving, but
<br />now you've started crusting over to a cold,
<br />hardcore bitch who doesn't take crap from
<br />anybody! Even though you try not to show
<br />emotions, you desperately want to let loose
<br />and go wild! You have an attitude that makes
<br />you irresistible to others and you are the
<br />one usually to take charge of situations.
<br />Deep down inside, though you repel people,
<br />all you want is that someone who will
<br />understand and wont turn away/ignore you like
<br />everyone else does. You want to be able to
<br />reach out and love them, but, you just cant
<br />for some reason You have created an icy
<br />barrier that shields you from reality, from
<br />what you don't want to believe. No one seems
<br />to understand you; not many can see past that
<br />barrier and see you, a <b>hurt</b> person
<br />just yearning to be able to embrace another
<br />or fit in! You tend to shy away from things;
<br />rejecting events/people bitterly and mouthing
<br />off anything that lurks in your mind at the
<br />time. You also tend to use humor or physical
<br />contact as a defense mechanism to protect
<br />anyone from seeing your pain. You convince
<br />yourself you're not afraid of anything or
<br />anyone, but in reality you're so insecure!
<br />All you want is someone to finally
<br />understand, see past that ice and hopefully
<br />even melt the shield. You just want comfort,
<br />you want that genuine someone! A person who
<br />likes you for you and understands what you've
<br />gone through or are going through. Underneath
<br />that cold exterior lies a warm, happy soul
<br />that wants to let loose and have fun! Your
<br />sanctuary would probably be any damn place
<br />you feel like being at! You can remain the
<br />same, but until you actually let your guard
<br />for once, youll never see what lives beyond
<br />the lies. Even if letting people in will
<br />cause some distress and pain, its all worth
<br />it in the end. At least youll know youre
<br />living a real life<P>

Although you may seem completely happy on the

<br />be that you are lonesome or misunderstood.
<br />Your eyes hold a great amount of sadness no

<br />might not cry that often in public, but it
<br />does happen behind closed doors.

<br />Understanding! Lifes many mysteries have
<br />become your ultimate goal to work out. You
<br />are neither a good or bad person, just very
<br />neutral, very stable. You look down on
<br />nothing or anyone, merely observe their point
<br />of view and make no judgments. You can be
<br />seen as very shadowy and uncertain in what
<br />you believe in to an outsider, but this isnt
<br />always true. You simply dont flaunt your
<br />views around. You have a few, close friends
<br />who rely on you, and love you for the way
<br />your never scorn for the way they live their
<br />lives. You are very caring and would make a
<br />great mother, seeing you always try to help
<br />those who come to you for your aid. You are
<br />extremely hard to anger, and yet when you
<br />are, your forgiveness is hard to gain. You
<br />are loyal, secretive, very quiet and often
<br />impassive, with few able to break around the
<br />wall that you built to protect yourself. Not
<br />everyone acknowledges you even exist, but you
<br />dont really care. As long as you have your
<br />close friends by your side, you are right to
<br />go. Although they might not voice it, many
<br />people long to have your ability to accept
<br />change as well as what cant be changed. Dont
<br />ever let others bring you down, because you
<br />are truly special, and those who have the
<br />courage to venture passed your walls of
<br />silence will only regret not having tried to
<br />befriend you sooner.
<b> Boy/Girl who will sweep you off your feet: </b>
<br />The mysterious boy/girl. The one who no one
<br />knows much about. You are attracted to
<br />him/her by the secrecy around him/her, and
<br />he/she loves how stable and unjudging you
<br />are.
<b> Your stone/jewel: </b>  Sapphire
<b> Your power: </b>  Life. The ability to bring
<br />those who have died back to life, as well as
<br />bring life back into those who have lost all
<br />hope.
<b> Your element: </b>  Lunar
<b> A quote that applies to you: </b> ""Do not
<br />be 'against' anything. Being 'against'
<br />weakens you. Be 'for' what you want. Being
<br />'for' empowers you.""

My friend Helena took me to see Harry Potter and the goblet of fire on saturday and i went to Ci Ci's pizza with Koala,Robert and Zeb oh koala is patrick. well anyways pat spent like $5 trying to win stuffed animals from one of those claw machines. It was so cool robert bought me a dozen red roses because he missed my birthday friday because he was in columbus soing meps and so was patrick. zeb on the other hand has no excuse for his lack of participation other than he claimed he was to broke to do anything because he paid his mom the money he owed her..............well thats bullshit because she keeps calling him asking where is her money. well my cat fancey is pregnant and i got internet at home again YAY!!!! well for all my friends reading this i regret to inform that BELMONT will not let me attend ever again due to my lack of grades at ECOT unless my grades improve DRASTICLY i will not be able to attentd unless i register for enrollment at the begigining of next year and i will have to sign a contract that says i will not, skip,smoke,drive, and or influence others to do so and it is standing until i graduate. lets face it im going to do all those things. but i loed and signed it anyways so at the start of next year i will be a student there and hopefully have classes with my friends (not that they will remember me) well i also broke my cell so that sucks i threw it at Zeb and it hit the wall and shattered i mean litteraly broke into like six pieces the back the battery the key pad the chipy thing and some other shiny pieces. well i have just finished my rantings i am now ready to tell you this HARRY POTTER IS AN AWSOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! i mean it was hillarious to hear the people in the theater go ""OMG! voldemort is back?"" and ""that is so sad, why did he kill the kid?"" i could hear all the people crying and it was so funny so at the the end of the movie when everyone was getting up tp leave i said to helena loudly ""I wonder what people will do when they realize snape is really bad and kills dumbledore"" and helena was like ""welll if they read the books they would know that."" then i said ""hey, if they read the book they would have known voldemort came back so that's not fair"" but it was great because we caught the last showing at regal 9:20pm and got out at like 12:00 and then went to eat at Taco-Bell and it was GREAT! so i wish you all a merry christmas and goodbye"

You still want to kill<br>them. And for a simple reason only; it's fun.<br>Seeing people in pain is like ecstasy. Maybe<br>you have some sort of mental problems or you<br>are this way because of previous deep scars,<br>only you know. But now you are sadistic and<br>maybe you only like to see a special group of<br>people be in pain (e.g. preps). However you are<br>not the most social person in the bunch and<br>people think you are weird. That bothers you<br>somewhat but atleast you can entertain yourself<br>with daydreaming about killing them. After all,<br>they have no idea what's coming.<br><br><b>Main weapon:</b> Explosives and torture<br>equpiment<br><b>Quote:</b> ""Insanity: a perfect<br>rational adjustment to an insane world"" - <br>R.D.

Angry Souls arent always<br>angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold<br>grudges. You probably often get in fights with<br>your friends and family, and its difficult for<br>you to understand. When someone makes a<br>mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to<br>those memories. Your very stubborn and your<br>rage is known to everyone. Though you never<br>actually mean it, you can say mean things in a<br>fight and go over board. Many people are<br>sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you<br>have many redeeming qualities and those are<br>that you are quite intelligent and smart. You<br>would make a good businesswoman or lawyer<br>because you know how to prove your point. You<br>cherish the ones around you, and appreciate<br>life, even though you can complain or throw a<br>tantrum now and then. The good things is, you<br>keep your emotions very outspoken, and are<br>normally a very happy person because all your<br>rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a<br>state, but you, yourself as a person, are<br>great.

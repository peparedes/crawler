"event","Hey guys!

im at my nana's house and im messin around on the computer so i thought id update this thing..

not too much is new.

ive been staying at my nana's house for the past few days. its good to have a break from everything. 

but im starting to miss my family. just not the stresses that come along with it. such as having so many 

people living in one house it can get hectic(sp).

but anyways....

today at school was pretty boring,

first hour in US History i didnt do much i took a test but thats it.

Second hour in science i took notes and hung out with jaquilin. hum. fun.

thrid hour in american lit we had to paraphrase 2 poems. it was very boring. 

Fourth hour i went down to the TMI room and helped out. i love the people in there they are always so 

happy but i dunno i dont think if i had a desise(sp) that would make me metally challenged i dont think i 

would be so happy. but its good to see that they are. 

at lunch me and coley walked around and talked im glad were starting to hang out more. she really is my

best freind.

5th hour in Alg. 1A i went to the native american room to get some help with my alg. hw. it was okay i guess.

and 6th hour in relationships we presented our freindship poem posters. when i present mine i showed all 

my pictures and had to say who they all were and when i got to mikes kayla jodie and ashley were 

like ""Your going out with mike! thats so cute!"" i thought it was pretty funny.

after school my nana picked me up and we went shopping she bought me new pants!!! i really needed some so 

im excited :) i shall wear them tommarow:)


but yeah i think that i wrote enough so im out!

Peace biotches!"

"event","hum. first id like to start off by saying mike and I are back together.

And i really believe that this time its going to last.

Ive had alot of ""me"" time and time to date other people.. and ive had time to realize that hes what makes me feel complete, yeah that sounds corny, but its true. Without him i feel so empty,like somethings missing. but whenever he comes around i get so smiley... I love the way he makes me smile.. i could be soo pissy and he could just say one word and im happy again.I Love Him and i know it for sure this time.Im not going to fuck up anymore because i hate the feeling of emptyness im not going to loose him agian. 


I LOVE YOU MIKE i mean it! Muah!

peace out!

Theres so many bad memory's in my old one

and i want to forget about them. 

So my solution is making a new journal.

This one is much cooler anyway...

The past four days have been shit,

But its made me relize that i need to try something new...

I need to veiw life in a differant way.

From now on im not going to talk about anyone behind their back

and im not going to lie or cheat

im going to try to be the best person i can be. 

and maybe life will go a little better.

instead of sitting around being depressed i need to do something about it. 

i need to make myself better in order to make life better. 

....

yeh thats it 

peace out bitches!

"event","There's a teacher in a small Texas town. She asks her class how many of them are Bush fans. 
Not really knowing what a Bush fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, all the kids raise their hands except one boy--Johnny. 

The teacher asks Johnny why he has decided to be different. Johnny says, ""I'm not a Bush fan."" 

The teacher says, ""Why aren't you a Bush fan?"" 

Johnny says, ""I'm a John F. Kerry fan."" The teacher asks why he's a Kerry fan. The boy says, ""Well, my mom's a Kerry fan, and my Dad's a Kerry fan, so I'm a Kerry fan!"" 

The teacher is kind of angry, because this is Texas, so she says, ""What if you're Mom was a moron, and you're dad was an idiot, what would that make you?"" 

Johnny says, ""That would make me a Bush fan."""

For good this time. It's been hard to say the least. Thats really why I haven't updated for a while. Ummmm, I work all the fucking time now, which is nice when it comes time for my paycheck.

My old high school's homecoming game is this friday and lots of my friends are coming home! I'm exited for that. Thats it for now gotta get to class."

"event","I just got home from class and I'm kind of tired.  I'm also kinda crabby because I'm missing my two J's. Joe and Jayce, they were my two closest friends before they left and now I feel...lonely.  I miss them, how will I get through the rest of the year with out them?  I told them when I was feeling sad and they helped me however they could.  It's hard also because I used to tell Dan everything as well and now it's just sort of strange since some of it is about him.  It's also like he is gone in a way as well.  I just feel so lost without their guidance even if sometimes it is only a shoulder to cry on.  Jayce is coming back on Friday, so I'm totally happy for that!  I can't wait to see him.  I also hope to go on a road trip soon with Dan to see Joe.  I can't wait to see how he is doing, and to meet all the new friends he has made.  As for Dan I hope he stays a large part of my life.  I know it will be tough for both of us at times, but damn it, he can relate to me like no one else sometimes and I just don't want to loose that.  We can sense things within each other at times and I think that is truly amazing.  Well I'm off to try and find something to do. I hate being here alone all night."

"event","""President Bush went out touting his economic record
in Ohio last week. Now this is a state that lost
225,000 jobs since Bush took office. You know, if Bush
wants to tout his record, he should do it somewhere
where the Bush economy has actually created jobs, like
India, or Thailand, or China."" -Jay Leno 

""President Bush has unveiled his first campaign
commercial, highlighting all of his accomplishes in
office. That's why it's a 60-second spot.""  - Jay Leno


""President Bush says he has just one question for the
American voters, ""Is the rich person you're working
for better off now than they were four years ago?"" - 
Jay Leno 

""The election is in full-swing. Republicans have taken
out round-the-clock ads promoting George Bush. Don't
we already have that? It's called Fox News.""  - Craig
Kilborn 

""Kerry is well on his way to reaching his magic number
of 2,162. That's the total number of delegates he
needs to win the Democratic nomination. For President
Bush it's different, his magic number is 5. That's the
number of Supreme Court judges needed to win.""  - Jay
Leno 

""There was a scare in Washington when a man climbed
over the White House wall and was arrested. This marks
the first time a person has gotten into the White
House unlawfully since President Bush."" - David
Letterman 

""A new poll says that if the election were held today,
John Kerry would beat President Bush by a double digit
margin. The White House is so worried about this,
they're now thinking of moving up the capture of Osama
Bin Laden to next month.""  - Jay Leno 

""The White House is now backtracking from its
prediction that 2.6 million new jobs will be created
in the U.S. this year. They say they were off by
roughly 2.6 million jobs."" - Jay Leno 

""In Louisiana, President Bush met with over 15,000
National Guard troops. Here's the weird part, nobody
remembers seeing him there.""  - Craig Kilborn 

""President Bush said he was 'troubled' by gay people
getting married in San Francisco. He said on important
issues like this the people should make the decision,
not judges. Unless of course we're choosing a
president, then he prefers judges."" - Jay Leno 

""The White House has now released military documents
that they say prove George Bush met his requirements
for the National Guard. Big deal, we've got documents
that prove Al Gore won the election."" - Jay Leno 

""There was an embarrassing moment in the White House
earlier today. They were looking around while
searching for George Bush's military records. They
actually found some old Al Gore ballots.""  - David
Letterman 

""The big story now is that President Bush is coming
under attack for his service in the National Guard.
The commanding officers can't remember seeing Bush
between May and October of '72. President Bush said,
'Remember me? I'm the drunk guy.'"" Jay Leno 

""On 'Meet the Press' yesterday President Bush was
asked what he would do if he lost the election and
Bush said, ''Phhh, you mean like last time?"" - Jay
Leno 

""This week, both John Kerry and Wesley Clark are
making campaign appearance with the guys who saved
their lives in Vietnam. Meanwhile, President Bush is
campaigning with a guy that once took a math test for
him.""   -  Conan O'Brien 

""Bush admitted that his pre-war intelligence wasn't
what it should have been. We knew that when we elected
him!""  - Jay Leno 

""It's weird watching President Bush struggle with
excuses for why we went to war. As he struggles, it
reminds us all what a terrific liar Bill Clinton
really was.""  - Craig Kilborn 

""As you know President Bush gave his State of the
Union Address, interrupted 70 times by applause and 45
times by really big words."" - Jay Leno 

""President Bush said that American workers will need
new skills to get the new jobs in the 21st century.
Some of the skills they're going to need are Spanish,
Chinese, Korean, because that's where the jobs went.""
- Jay Leno 

""President Bush wants to build a space station on the
moon. And from the moon, he wants to launch people to
Mars. You know what this means.  He's been drinking
again."" -David Letterman 

""Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has written a
book about his years with the Bush Administration. He
said that President Bush while at cabinet meetings is
disengaged, he's uninformed, distracted, he's passive,
and the Democrats are saying to themselves "" how can
we possibly beat this guy?""  -  David Letterman 

The new Prime Minister of Spain has called the war in
Iraq a disaster, and plans to bring his troops home as
soon as possible. In fact, President Bush is so upset
at Spain that he is now threatening to close down the
border between Spain and the U.S.  - Jay Leno 

""The U.S. army confirmed that it gave a lucrative
fighting contract in Iraq to the firm once run by the
Vice President Dick Cheney without any competitive
bidding. When asked if this could be conceived as
Cheney's friends profiting from the war, the spokesman
said 'Yes."" Conan O'Brien 

""Dick Cheney finally responded today to demands that
he reveal the details of the Enron meetings. This is
what he said. He met with unnamed people, from
unspecified companies, for an indeterminate amount of
time at an undisclosed location. Thank God he cleared
that up."" - Jay Leno 

""Plans are being discussed as to who will replace Dick
Cheney if he has to resign for health reasons. It's
not easy for President Bush, he can't just name a
replacement. He would first have to be confirmed by
the oil, gas and power companies""   - Jay Leno 

""President Bush spoke briefly to reporters before
playing a round of golf in Crawford, Texas earlier
today. ... This raises the question: 
Shouldn't the guy who is really running the country
and who has had like 20 heart attacks be taking the
vacation?""   - Craig Kilborn 

""While speaking to conservationists this week, Dick
Cheney made it clear that he plans to deal with the
rising gas prices by drilling in our federal wildlife
refuge in Alaska. Cheney tried to sway his opponents
saying trust me, there's enough oil up there to last
us the rest of my natural life.""  -  Tina Fey, on
Saturday Night Live's ""Weekend Update"" -30-"

Jayce and I have talked on line and he said the parties there are CRAZY.  Apparently he, Emily Mcdillon, and CHRIS WEBB got totally smashed!  (Yes I did say Chris Webb) They rode a mechanical bull and everything!  Jayce is totally gunna be a frat guy!  Thats so crazy!  He wants me to come and visit him soon and I want to also.  Maybe Labor day weekend.  Classes are doing well for me so far.  I met a really cute guy in my math class.  He's straight but he's cool.  Oh I also just got back from seeing the movie Open Water with Brad and I didn't really like it.  It was like we sat and watched the movie for nothing.  I don't know I wouldn't recommend it anyway.  God I can't wait to get my license!  So I can just LEAVE whenever I want.  Let's see what else is new?.....Oh! I found out who was leaving those comments on my livejournal!  Yeah I was not to happy.  The whole thing is is that I still don't know why.  All I do know is that the person heard that I was talking shit about them over the summer.  When in all actuality that is furthest from the truth.  I barely thought about the person all summer!  I saw her 3 times at the most all summer long.  Oh well, I don't really care I stopped talking to her in the end of the year because she thought she was so much better than everyone else.  Sort of a ""my shit don't stink attitude"" ya know?  I also heard that she said she hopes I get aids from Dan and that we both die.  So I just decided that she is a miserable cunt.  And I never use that word.  Well my grandma, aunt, and I are going out to eat by Dan so I'm going to go get ready.  love u guys!"

"event","Yesterday was my one day off this week.  So I decided it would be the best day to go take my placement tests at MCC.  I thought I had to take them all (because they all had a little check next to them on the card I got in the mail) but it turns out I only had to take the math one.  Thank god for that!  Later on that day after I had showered my cell rang and it said Culver's.  So I figured it was Jayce asking when were going t a party.  I answered and It was Rob (my manager) begging me to come because I was the only one who knew how to close the custard machines.  So I went to work and It sucked!  I didn't get out of there till like 10:45 which is crazy!  Then everybody who was going to the party came to get me and I said that I did't want to go because I was so mad at everyone working and I was just to tired.  So everyone was mad.  Also Jayce had really wanted to go so I felt bad.  Then Dan asked If I wanted to go see The Village so I said sure because that only requires sitting, but he didn't want to wait at my house till I got off so he just went home, but not before getting into a fight with Redd on my phone. (I asked Dan to get it for me from my house) So thats always funny.  After I got home Jayce and I were sitting in my room later when Bill called! He had gotten back from Canada early and he wanted to hang out.  I missed him soooo much!  I love that kid!  So It was the three of us again just like old times.  We decided to maybe drink a little but then Brad called and it turned out that he, Lauren, and Erin needed a ride back to his place.  So we took them and Bill got pretty drunk Jayce to but just didn't feel like it.  So I went and slept in Brads closet by myself.  That was my day and now I want today off!"

I don't know who you are but if I were going to insult someone I would't do it through anonymous little notes.  I would say it to their face.  The least you could do is say who you are so I could say something back.  If it was a friend who wrote these comments than I'm sorry you feel that way about me but don't pretend to be my friend.  Just let me know how you feel.  If it was someone I don't know well don't be judging people you don't know.  I know I got enough of that in high school, I don't need it here.  Now for my friends who read my journal if you would like to comment on what this little prick has said to me check out the comments in the entry before this one and in the one about the whole hicky ordeal, and also in the one where I jokingly comment on how maybe Pres. Bush is the reason I hadn't received my voters registration card.  Thanx much!"

It was like a dance party down stairs with crazy lights, music, fog, and bubbles!  It was fun to say the least, and I got fucked up pretty decent!  Then I went back to Brads where I was going to spend the night but I realized I had no way home in the morning.  Then Dan called from Lauras phone and he said he'd pick me up if I wanted so I said sure.  Dan....hmmmm, truth be told I don't know whats going on between the two of us again.  I thought it was over for good this last time like for real!  Then I see him and BOOM!  All I can think about is how happy I am with him. I don't know nor do I think I ever will. lol  I guess what we have we have for right now and I'll just cherish it until it's over.  Whenever that maybe. lol  There is supposed to be a party at Brads tomorrow but I don't know if I'm going or not.  Depends on what kind of a mood I'm in after I close.  I don't know how much into people I will be.  On a plus side I have been getting lots of hours at Culver's so my pay check should be awesome!  Well thats it for now I'm tired."

"event","So I went to 6 Flags yesterday for gay day and had lots of fun! I went with Dan, Joe, Shawn, Rob, Dan's ex-boyfriend Jason, and Eric (Who came later in the day).  I saw Jason and got jealous right away in the car on the way there.  He was HOTT!! Soooooo much better looking than me, but I decided that I wanted to have fun and not to make myself sad all day. So I put it aside and decided to get to know him. He was really nice and the two of us got along great.  We also met two girls Sonja and Sarah.  They were really cool and hung out with us the hole day.  Dan didn't really talk to Rob, Jason or I like the hole day!  Well he did but not much.  So after dropping off Rob in Elgin and Jason in Chicago (Where I also left my cell phone) Shawn fell asleep in the back seat and Dan and I got to talking(this was the not so fun part).  He said he felt really weird with Jason and I there for a few reasons.  One I guess there was question of him and Dan getting back together right before he and I started dateing.  So for some time Jason was jealous of me.  (Which is weird to think of because I was so jealous and worried of Jason in the beginning of my and Dan's relationship)  Then to top it off...Well I just typed a hole lot and then deleted it because some people who read my journal know the people I will be talking about and it's not something thats really my place to be telling you guys, even though I want to.  Needless to say it makes me feel weird, real shitty, and betrayed at the same time.  Dan didn't really want to tell me any of this I dont think but I really wanted to know what was on his mind so he did.  Then this morning we fought for a while too.  I think I can't except our break up because I just don't understand how someone can suddenly stop caring for someone else like that.  My love foe Dan only grew as we Dated and I never would have Dated him in the first place if I didn't that would happed.  So what was he thinking when he started dating me?  Or what was different when he stopped? A long time ago when I was very suicidal I told myself all I wantd before I died was to experience a real meaningfull relationship.  I'v done that now...I wont kill myself because I first, don't want him to think it was because of him because it wouldn't be. It would be because I don't see my life progressing anywhere and well...lets not get into why I would.  Second, I'm pretty shur if I was gone my mom wouldn't survive and if both of us were gone my grandma would be all alone wishing she were gone to and I couldn't do that to either of them.  I don't know...even though I wont killed myself I've picked up some old bad habbits.  I just wish I was more of an opptomist, or that I cared and loved myself more.  I wish I wasn't so dependent on other people for EVERYTHING!  Wheather it be for love or rides to where ever I need to go, I depend on other people. I hate that about myself!  I think I'm done for tonight.  Sorry to everybody who reads my entrys they can't be all that uplifting."

My grandma got me contacts so now I have them.  When my grandma, mom, and I went to dinner at Joey's Dan had set flowers and a card on our table.  In the card was a season pass to great america!  Plus he ordered me a book that is out of print, and my tattoo.  Everything I have tried to do for him has totally backfired!  The kid already has a star!  Who has a star I mean come on!  Then the thing I ordered him wont come in on time, and the big special thing is soooo expensive!  So I will have to save up for it.  Plus I don't know how much he'll even like it...I feel so bad with nothing to give him now. :-(  I don't know...Why did he already have to have a fucking star!  Oh, also my dad isn't coming to my graduation.  He said that what I did was low...how was it low to go to prom with Dan?  Because I didn't want to lie to him anymore, and I wanted him to be there for a day special to me?  How was that low?  To not call your son on his 18th birthday, and to not go to his high school graduation over something that can't be helped.  I can't help that I am gay.  I knew my dad and I would never be close for this reason but I never thought he would do the things he is doing.  Never."

She just left my grndma to drive herself to the doctor, after dissaperng with my grandmas car, cell phone, and laundry for two days.  I just don't know how I'm going to got to school, go to work to pay for our bills, watch my grandma to make shur she isn't pushing herself to hard, do homework, clean the house, and keep the yard from looking like a forest all at the same time!  grrrrr!  I wish I wasn't so stupid and I just would have gotten myself my licens!  It would be so helpful right now.  Not to mention with every prodject that I get done with in school like 50 more come.  Also Dan and I totally broke it off and he has done like a totle 180 when it comes to me.  It's like he just doesn't care as much.  Like us breaking up didn't even phase him.  Also he seems happier now.  To think that I might have been at least part of the cause to make someone who I care about so much feel unhappy is just a killer for me.  I miss him...but I have to move on.  There is nothing I can do about the way he feels about me now (or the lack of feelings).  I'm just so tired, mentally.  I'll get through it by myself though.  I always do."

Ever feel like your just a fake, worthless burrden to everyone you know?  Like your selfish because your only holding someone back who might be so much happier with out you.  Have you ever felt empty... 
This is why i've been writing in my actuall journal because I don't want anyone to know how I'm really feeling.  There is so much I could say but thats privet even to you guys."

"event","You make my heart wilt just like a red rose
Minus the thorns to prick you
I stand open to all of my foes
The walls I have made knocked down by you
You can say words that stab like daggers
I feel so hurt by you
The ""I'm sick of you"" looks I get my way, make me sway and stagger
With everything I gave I thought I meant more
I used to feel so close to you
You make my heart wilt just like a red rose
Minus the thorns to prick you
Wish I would have known I was such a chore
Now I wont stand in the way of you"

"event","Well I'm totally exited for prom!  It's gunna be sooooo much fun!  Yeah Jayce really disappointed me today at work. I worked from 10:00 am to 10:30 pm and at 9:30 I asked him if he could do me the favor of closing so I could go see a movie with Dan and Joe.  He gave me the excuse that he had a lot of homework.  OK he probably did have some but I doubt it was a lot.  He told Cheryl he haden't seen Myla all weekend so I bet he was supposed to talk with her.  I wasn't so much disappointed that I didn't get to go to the movie but more that Jayce would do that.  I donno, I would have totally done it for him even if he had only started at like 5:00.  I had an 11:00 day!!! the most he has ever worked is 6 hours!!!  Maybe I should quit being the nice guy.  It would solve lots of my problems.  I didn't get to do a single thing today because I worked alll f-in day!  All because I took Ryans day because I'm nice.  When will I get a break?"

I think Nichole was really upset today, I hope everything is O.K.  Also Billy slept over last night so we hung out till like 11:30 and I just love hanging out with the kid! :-) He's my buddy!  I had a weird dream in which Shannon Burke jerked Bill and I off at the same time too!  Thats so strange and creepy!  What else am I forgetting...Oh yeah, I hung out with Eric and Redd for a little bit.  God Redd is still hot.  It always seems like he's trying to make me jealous though, I guess he doesn't understand that I don't give a damn.  Whatever.  I guess thats all i'm not really in the mood to type more."

My last entry seemed like I was mad at him but I'm not. We are still friends, and he and I are still going to prom together.  He has his interview with my dean tuesday.  Lets hope he proves to be an outstanding gentleman. lol!....ah Kill Bill rocks! ;-)"

I fucking hate people who use the word gay to describe something negative!!!  It pisses me off sooooo much!  Anyway, I think Joe is putting in a journal entry also right now (we are in the same class).  So I found out that this guy named Jason sort of has intrest in me.  He's a good guy as far as I know.  I told Laura I would have to get to know him a lot before anything would happen.  I wont jump into a relationship again like I did with Dan.  I mean we all saw how well that worked out."

"event","I love my Billy!  Bill got me out of my house and we drove around for a while and then we went and saw Hellboy.  Which I liked.  Bill didn't like it as much as I did and I'm pretty shure Dan said he didn't like it at all, but you have to take it as type of movie it was ment to be.  It wasn't ment to be oscar worthy.  It was simply ment to be a fun action adventure movie.  I think it served its pourpus well.  I was entertained.  Anyway enough about Hellboy.  I just had such a good time with Billy.  It was like when I got in the car I could feel him in it.  I could tell as long as I was with him I was safe and (this sounds so cheesey but it's true) I could feel the love around me.  The two of us have been through alot together, good times and rough times.  I just know how much he cares about me and I'm pretty shure he knows how much I care about him.  I hope I do always keep in touch with him.  Some day I want his kids call me uncle Kyle.  He just seems to know exactly what I need.  For instance, I got in his car we drove around my neighborhood and listened to some music.  All I did was cry.  Not crazy balling or anything but a good healthy cry. Once he could see the tears sort of settle we talked about me, him, and just things in general then we went and saw the movie.  Somehow he just knew to let me get it out.  Needless to say I'm in a much better mood.  Dan called while we were in the movie.  I went in the hall and answered it.  It's nice just to hear him.  I miss him, I mean it's a little weird to go from seeing someone everyday to barely talking to them at all.  He said he would try to call tomarrow.  I hope he does because there is prom stuff I need to work out with him.  Maybe I can convince him to come over(probubly not though).  I'm lucky, I have a fag hag (Cheryl) and a fag stag (Billy).  Then I also have Molly who is sort of my second fag hag and Brian State who is like my fag stag at work. :-)"

I don't feel like I'm worth anything.  I feel like I wont go anywhere in life.  I feel like there is no point.  I hate feeling this way!  I don't know what to do to stop it though! Damb it!  It's weird I don't think anyone really knows it but I have like no self esteem at all.  I pretend like I do though.  God I am like freaking out for no reason!!!  I can't stop crying!  I haven't felt like this in a long time and frankly that was O.K. with me.  Why do I get this way?  I just need reassurance from someone right now I think maybe...I don't know. The truth is I don't know what I need but I know it's something."

"event","I just hung out with Dan for the first time since we broke up.  It made me ponder a few things...like what if we hadn't jumped into dateing so fast and just started out as friends?  Would we have become good friends?  Would we have ended up dating at all?  Would we have been good friends, gone out, and then had a longer or even better relationship?  Or maybe a shorter bad relationship.  I guess their questions I will never have answered to.  I also told him that I had thought about prom and said yes that even though we are not together I still want to take him.  Problem is now I'm not so shure he wants to go with me.  I understand it though.  It's a HUGE step for him and if he doesn't care for me the same way or doesn't feel as comfortable as he did before than I wouldn't want him to do it.  I'm going to be O.K. I just hope I wasn't another name on the list.  Someone he'll forget the name of when he is listing off names of people he's messed around with.  I hope I meant something to him because he will always mean something to me."

"event","So I sort of feel bad because Laura just wrote recently how Dan doesn't call her anymore and they don't really hang out. It is partly because of me. I just expect Dan and I to see each other all the time and I shouldn't. I wonder though...He is going through a really confusing time right now and I wonder if I'm just adding to his confusion and frustration. No matter what I don't want to be a burden to him. Thats all I thought I was to people for so long, I don't want it to become true. I think it would be good for him to talk to Laura. Maybe she can help him in some way."

Now because of my mom and grandma not ready to let me go I have to stay here, and go to MCC for a year which is going to make me not eligible for grants when I want to go to Columbia. I shouldn't have let them talk me into staying. I almost didn't have a choice. They said I would get no help or support from them if thats what I wanted to do. I know that my entire life would be different if I had gone...It would have been better...I would have been happier. I need to get into the city somehow. I wont stay here in this stupid town for the rest of my life, I wont do it! I hate this house! and all the animals in it. I feel like I live in a petting zoo! I HATE IT HERE!"

Sure you'll bend over, but only for dinner, drinks, and diamonds<br>
You give a whole new meaning to ""Work That Ass!""

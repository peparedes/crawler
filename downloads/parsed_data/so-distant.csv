Konichiwa,

And I thought friends were forever... Man was I ever wrong. I`m sorry things came out this way. But I guess our friendship isn`t meant to be. I wont beg for forgivenvess. I wont even ask for it. We`ve both agreed to have each other out of our lives. And we have to go with that. I guess this is what God had planned out for our friend ship, for it to crash and blow up. But you seem fine with it, so I should too. I mean I do regret saying I wanted you out of my life. But now I don`t know what to say to you anymore. I might be loud, and I`m sorry it`s who I am I can`t change it. I`m might have a big mouth, but I`ll learn how to control it with help and time. But it`s too late now. For both of us. Too bad, it was funwhile it lasted. I wrote a reply to your aa post before but that was me swearing my head off and trying to tell you off. But then I realized, I don`t want our friendship to end like that. We could still be out of each others life, and be strangers but not enemies. But then I thought you`re under alot of stress about the whole Kimberly thing, and I`m sorry I felt left out, I bet you would too. But you had no right to talk to me the way you do, so in some ways I`m glad you`re out of my life, I wont need to be put down more by you, I get enough of it at home I don`t need it from my so called friend either. Then I thought to myself, I know I will be the one apoligizing, but I wont. Not now. Not ever. You lost me as a friend. You`ve lost all my respect for you. You`ve lost everything that has to do with me. And I don`t know what to say to you. All I have to say is I wont be running to you for help, I wont be needing your help. I have wonderful friends: Kamila, Carol, Michelle, Danielle, Christine, Lisa, Lily, Jackie, and everyone else I truly love. If this is how our friendship is supposed to end up, then... Good-bye forever Sabrina Nguyen. It was fun when it lasted. Through the good and bad times, our memoried shared will never be forgotten.

Sayonara,

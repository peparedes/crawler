"event","So, I got tired of my earbuds that my brother had given me from his Ipod. They keep falling out of my ears and all that business, so, tonight I bought a pair of skull candy earbuds. It's really weird!&nbsp; I cant hear anything but the music. Weird thing though, they have quite alot of bass. Not an annoying amount but definately noticeable. im gonna assume this is normal?
My nephew has a set of regular skullcandy headphones and those are pretty awesome.
But this bass is gonna take some getting used to. Or maybe I should try the other size pads that came with the buds.
Anyway, its a well spent 16 bucks."

"event","<br /><font size=""4"">So im really excited about the new V series.<br />It's been 26 years since I was a kid, glued to the TV when each new episode came on.<br />Of course I dont remember it all, but I do remember how riveted everyone was. And I do mean everyone. <br />I am really hoping the new V does the old one justice, or is even better.<br />Also, as a side note, for all you Whedonites out there,The lead Visitor is played by <strong>Morena Baccarin.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Alan Tudyk</strong> is also&nbsp;part of the cast.<br />At least the pilot episode, according to wikipedia, but im hoping he has a recurring role.<br />So far the pilot is good, shows promise.<br />I do believe i'll be tuning in every week.</font>"

Just...holy shit....what?

Michael Jackson is...Dead.
Im not entirely sure how I feel about that.
Shocked, sad....
I grew up with this man and his music.
 He's just so iconic that it just doesnt feel like its real.
Sure he got really weird but, in the end, it was all about his art, his music, and that was still an awesome thing.
All around the world, he will be missed."

In fact, I keep getting all these Cosmic Signs that this trip was meant to be. For example, my mothers scarf that I pulled out this past winter, made in Taiwan. So many products where I work..made in Taiwan, which, to me is different, because so many things used to be made in pakistan and china and other places.

"event","<br /><span style=""font-size: large""><span><span>So, it started a little over a week ago. I was out of things to read, and I was looking around the book section at work and happened upon this series of books called The House of Night. The first book is called Marked. The cover looked interesting, as did the description so, I snagged it up and dug in.<br />It left me feeling rather, annoyed. Without giving the story away~because I DO hate spoilers~ i'll just say that there was A LOT of, how shall I say...Forced Paganism, upon the characters. Being an agnostic, this really got under my skin. Forced ANYTHING really pisses me off, especially when it comes to religion.<br />Anyway, the core basis of the story is good enough I suppose. I just finished book 3. I know what you're thinking...BOOK THREE? And you just started a WEEK AGO? Well, the books arent that huge and yes, im a fast reader. Now, although im whipping through these books, they dont give me that same passion that Twilight did.You know,&nbsp;that whole....&quot;Cant....Put...book...down....ugh...must...sleep&quot; thing, After book one, the blatant paganism-in-your-face-ness is well, not so, in your face. It's still there, but not as bad as in book one and focuses more on the core of the story. The heart of the matter, if you will and so that's whats kept me going. But I will plunge on until the very end. The books have, I will admit, evoked emotions in me. I found myself crying at one part, at work, in the break room. Talk about embarassing!<br />So, I heard the other day, that these books are supposed to be the next Twilight. They even have movie talks in the making or something.<br />So, my response to this:<br /><br />Decent books?<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />Next Twilight?<br /><br />Not bloody likely.</span><br /></span></span>"

"event","<br /><font size=""5"">I remember it like it was yesterday. I was at my friends place to use his phone, and on his TV was some really bizzare show. <br />&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; I asked. His reply was simple. &quot;Buffy&quot;<br />&quot;Buffy? Oh, right, I heard they were gonna make a show out of the movie.&quot;<br />It was already into the second season before my friend got me watching it. All it took was one episode before I was hooked, and two episodes before I was REALLY hooked, for life. With each new episode came a sense of completion, support, love. So many things I went through seemed to be mirrored somehow in Buffy, and therefore helped me through. It was then that I&nbsp;realized that Joss Whedon was my Master now.And then there was Angel and Firefly. Both such amazing works of art, otherwise known as TV shows. But when they ended, sadness ensued. No longer would my television deliver me the same depth, flawless puns and quips, the same gut-wrenching, heartbreaking comfort again.<br />Until now....<br />Tonight was the premiere of Dollhouse. As first episodes go, it was good, but still a bit early to tell how much of a keeper it really is. Truth be told, I missed bits of it because, stupid me, I timed my dinner at the wrong time, so I kept having to get up during the EXTREMELY short commercial breaks.<br />At any rate, it's good to see Buffy/Angel alumni on tv again.<br />It was also so very good to see the Mutant Enemy thing at the end of the show.<br />So much so that I didnt realize just how much I had missed it. My breath caught in my throat, a smile spread on my lips and a tear welled up in my eyes.<br />Dearest Joss Whedon, he is my Master, now and forever. It's so good to have his work back on my TV.<br />Grrr. Argh</font>"

"event","All I have to say is....OH. MY. GOD. 
What am I saying this about, you ask? 
Twilight. 
My&nbsp;Neice got me the first two books for christmas. I had no intention of reading them on my own before I got them as a gift, nor was I going to see the movie. 
You see, everyone thinks that just because I love Buffy and Interview with the vampire, that I will read anything and everything related to vampires. Novel wise that is. This is incorrect. 

So, 2 days ago, I started reading Twilight and, Holy Crow! It has been SO LONG since i've read a book that is SO engrossing that it actually physically pains me to not be reading it! I cant seem to read it fast enough. It's as if my body wants to plunge itself INTO the book, just so I can &quot;compute&quot; the story faster. im currently 3/4 of the way through the book, and I hate having to put it down, be it because im at work and on break and have to go BACK to work, or because I have to sleep. It's like crack!&nbsp; Not even my beloved Dean Koontz writes books that make me salivate and go through withdrawal symptoms. This book literally makes my hands tremble and itch to touch it, to turn its pages, and my mind is in a whirl, waiting with baited breath with each new paragraph. Hell, even the BORING parts are exciting! 
I only hope the other three books are as engaging and wonderful as this one."

Only, theres not much to update.
I'm nursing a mild cold, but thats okay, because I have the week off.
Tuesday may 20th is the 2 year anniversary of my Mothers death.
Im debating going to the cemetery. I debate only because I was just up there on mothers day.
I know my mothers beliefs on where she's buried. It's not her. It's just a shell. She's not there anymore, so I dont NEED to go look at a headstone. This is how she felt about her own mothers grave, and I guess thats how she felt about death.
She never really&nbsp;talked about it much. Not to me anyway. When asked what she wanted done, she would always joke and say ""Just throw me in the dumpster or something.""
Basically she meant, she didnt care, because she wasnt going to be there for it and I suppose she also meant she didnt want people to go to a bunch of trouble over a person that no longer occupied a body.
It makes sense I suppose.
But we did right by her, as some would say, and people came out it droves for the viewing and the funeral. She was loved by so many people.


okay, enough of that or im gonna start crying, and we dont need that.
I have my passport and the picture is shitty, and I have to live with it for 10 years. blah!
But its one step closer to my caribbean vacation this summer. Yay!

Im growing my hair out and its kind of at the Soccer Mom stage of growth at the moment.

As for tv.....I saw the season finales of Bones and House and all im going to say is....OH MY GOD!!!

Foot Tapper, you are Never gonna see it coming!!

Hmm...and...im still addicted to Taiwanese Idol Drama's and Hot asian men, which, if you look at my Myspace profile, you'd know what I mean lol.

Well, thats about all for now I suppose.

Me and my friend Adam are going to the Caribbean this summer! St. Maarten to be exact. I've never been anywhere this exotic before, so I really cant wait!
Part of me wishes mom were still here so she could go with me. The realistic side knows she wouldnt be able to go and thus would be upset about me going, because she never got to go anywhere&nbsp;. So, this is why I have decided to travel. Every summer my friend and I are going to go somewhere new, to all the places she never got to see. She's with me now, I know that, so this way, its like she's coming with me on my trips.

So anyway, im gonna get my passport and save every penny I can for this trip because you know I just have to go shopping when im down there!"

Friday, august 31 we had out back to school midnight madness for the freshmen going to U of Michigan and man was it busy! We usually get about 3000 freshmen, this year we had somewhere around 6000!
Anyway, while I was working, I kept noticing all the very HOT asian boys. I mean, they were everywhere. It was like, Holy Shit! However, the sad part is, they were mostly freshman, meaning, no older than 19 or 20 at best, and im over here at a whopping 34!
Yes, I know, 18 is legal, but um...ew! I'm not THAT hard up!

In other news, the second week of august I took a trip to Chicago, on a train. Those were both firsts for me, so it was exciting. The trip was fun, when we weren't getting pissed rain on! We went to the Hancock Observatory, instead of Sears Tower, at night, and man, it was amazing! We also went to Navy Pier and watched the fireworks and hung out for a bit. We ate at the famous (or maybe not so much) Billy Goat Tavern. Anyone thats a big fan of SNL would know it by the ""Cheeseborger cheeseborger cheeseborger!"" bit.
We did a little shopping, rode the subway, which was entertaining in and of itself. We went to the Field Museum and looked at the Egyptian stuff and ate at their McDonalds(and we visited the ""swanky"" chicago location too) And naturally, we went to some bars. All in all, it was a good trip, even if the drivers ARE angry people.

The last week at work has been nothing but a college kid filled NIGHTMARE! (the only perks being the cute asian guys!) Every 30 minutes i'd have TWO shopping carts FULL of returns, so thats all i've been doing every single night since friday! Ugh! Everyone has been held over so that we can get all the departments done and straightened, and basically, nobody left until midnight every night, when most of us are due out at 11 pm. Tonight I didnt get out until friggin 12:30! Man am I beat!
Anyway, that was all I wanted to update everyone on."

"event","Where the time went?

Sunday May 20th (yesterday) was the one year mark of my Mothers passing.
I didnt go to the cemetery. Hell I didnt even get dressed. I took the day off from work.
There wasnt as much crying and wailing as I thought there would be, not to say there wasnt any at all.
It was just strange. An entire year has come and gone, and I still feel as if that year, this chunk of time, is missing from my life. It's missing. I dont know where it went, but I do know that its time that im never going to get back.
I still miss her more than ever.
Life still feels hollow and empty.
Any plan or goal I may have had before, seems pointless now.
People tell me i'll get over that feeling, but somehow, I dont think so."

NO DATES LISTED FOR DETROIT?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WTF?!<br /><br />I missed the concert last year because, well, it was at the Fox Theatre, and, to be honest, I didnt have $100 to fork over for a concert...for ONE ticket. *sigh*<br /><br />I dont really have the money for it this year either, but I REALLY wanna see him in concert!"

It made her giggle because she thought ""hehe, Karens a closet asian"".&nbsp; This was funny to me. I laughed.</font></p><p><font size=""4"">But really, ever since I became an adult, people have assumed that im part asian. Okay, so I have small eyes that squint when I laugh and I have really difficult hair, but hello? have you SEEN me? I'm like, really white. I guess it doesnt help to have neices and a nephew that are half asian, because when we're in public together, people STILL ask me...are you sure you're not asian? People always thought they were my children when they were little.</font></p><p><font size=""4"">Then we have the Gackt Issue. I adore him, for more than just his pretty face.</font></p><p><font size=""4"">Now, to make matters worse, I have become addicted to....*drum roll please..*</font></p><p><font size=""4"">Taiwanese Drama's!</font></p><p><font size=""4"">WTF HAS HAPPENED TO ME?

Not just college students either. It's kinda like, when you get a new pair of glasses, or a new car, you start to notice everyone else that has the exact same pair of glasses, or new car.</font></p><p><font size=""4"">Maybe its a Conspiracy.

"event","One week ago today, a Hush fell over the crowd. 
Then a light went out and screams were heard that
sounded as if they came from the ends of the earth.

The beat of the music went on,
But her heart did not.
She laughed and danced
and had a wonderful time,
or so it is im told....

But how, I scream, when she wasnt even that old,
could she be taken so very far away,
From me,from the world, from life.

I try to think of happy things,
but all of those are gone now.
She was my everything and now im lost without her.

All thats left are memories,
but it doesnt seem like those are enough.
I long to hear her silly laugh,
to feel her arms around me.

I want her here,
I want her back with me,
But this I know,
is never meant to be.

The only thing to do now is ride out each day,
and hope that one day, a hush will fall over the raging,
wailing, screaming, suffering and suffocating anguish in my chest."

Garr!

I went to see the Davinci Code with mom. It was pretty decent. Not enough to make me go read the book, but, decent enough by itself. (Much like Harry Potter. You'll never get me to read them, you hear?! NEVER!) 
Anyhow, there was this very small group of people on the steps of the Quality 16 theatre. Someone had a camcorder and this lady was talking about the movie and she mentioned something about Jesus. I didnt hear much of anything so I dont know if she was for or against the movie. Either way...whats the big god damn deal?
It's just a work of fiction...get over it already!

has anyone seen the previews for the new Omen movie? It looks really good and I so cant wait to see it.

HAHA! thats so funny! Alan Rickman is playing a southern accent in this movie, Judas Kiss, so is Emma Thompson. It's funny, his accent I mean.I keep expecting them to slip up and go all british.
okay...im rambling now."

"event","So thursday night, I went to my friends place for the weekend and fun was had. Except for saturday night, which im really kind of pissed about.
I did get my hair done though. coloured and cut. black and copper (high and low lights) and it just barely touches my shoulders. I wanted it shorter but my friend Adam (who does my hair and who I was visiting) didnt. so, we comprimised, since my hair was to the middle of my back. Im so happy with my new hair and everyone at work loves it. Even the guys, which is a bit shocking but hey, im not complaining.

Anyway, Saturday~Adam's boyfriend Jason really pissed me off. First he tells Adam and I that he'd take us to see a movie and then bring us back. Adam didnt really want to do that, so no real plans were made. *footnote~every saturday night they hold poker night at their place. Jason had told adam that they werent going to have poker night this week, prior to coming to get me* So within the next half hour, people start calling for poker night, and Jason keeps telling them to come over and that poker night was on.
I dont play cards, let alone poker and im not a very quick learner as I have very low comprehension skills on many things. Adam starts insisting that I play, and Jason, who i've ever only been around 4 times, starts insisting I play, as if he's known me for a long time, like adam and I have. That really started pissing me off, considering I was told poker wasnt going to be an issue to begin with. Then, he goes out to get booze and stuff...and brings back his 9 year old daughter! WTF?? *another footnote~I was sleeping in the spare room where, apparently his kid uses when she comes over*
So then all these people start showing up. this one couple shows up with THEIR daughter! Again, W.T.F.??!!!
a couple of the people were nice enough I guess, but I was just really not into it.
So, while the game got going, these 2 children were running around, playing games, and going into the room that I was using, where all my things were! And sure, its normally the kids room, but Jason should have had manners enough to tell his fucking kid to stay the fuck outta there for the night because I, his visitor, was using it.

I expressed this concern to Adam and I was just blown off about it. I'd go in there to get something out of my bag and there were god damn toys all over the bed, where my things were.(clothes, pajamas) so I cleaned them off and put them in the hall. But they just kept going back in there, and nobody said anything. So, I made myself something to eat, ate, got undressed and went the fuck to bed. Within 30 minutes, Jason's kid busts in, turns on the lights, sees that im in there trying to sleep, and she leaves, without shutting the damn light off!So I had to get up and shut it off myself. I went to bed somewhere around 12:30 am and got up at noon. Between those 12 hours, i'd say I got about 4 hours sleep, but its really hard to know for sure due to all the waking up I was doing and laying there trying to get back to sleep.
Today(sunday) we got a late start because Jason was passed out from being up so late and drunk off his ass. Then I get up, get dressed, get packed and all that and his fucking kid looks at me and says ""you're welcome for sleeping in my room"". I dont know what she meant, but I really dont give a fuck at this point. Jason then comandeers my money to buy lunch for everyone, including his fucking kid. On top of that, he orders 2 sandwhiches for himself! Adam got 2 arby melts, but I dont mind paying for Adam. We do that for each other from time to time. We've been friends for 6 and a half years, it's expected and goes without saying. Then on the way home, he makes a remark about a loved one that im not even going to repeat. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with Jason at all and I told Adam that if I come out there again, it wont be on the weekend.

All that being said, It was good to see Adam again. Last time I saw him was thanksgiving and i've really missed him. We didnt do much of anything thursday night and friday, but thats okay. I dont mind so much, so long as we get to spend some time together."

Where to begin?
two sundays ago mom had a mild heart attack and had a 3 day hospital stay.
They gave her the whole nine yards testing with the heart catheder and blood thinners and everything.
She's been home since last wednesday and is doing good. She's off work for another week and can also not drive for another week. It's driving her bonkers. 

Our store is going through major remodel. the finish date is sometime in september. and then they start on the grocery side of the store.

I really dont like Elliot Yamin, especially when he tries to sing the Buble! I speak of course, of American Idol. His ""Vibratto"" really annoys me. A lot.

im going to my friends place next week and im FINALLY getting my hair done.
I want something drastic, but he doesnt since he does my hair. Im going through my ""I want it gone"" phase. I know that once its gone, i'll cry about it for a bit, but I eventually always get over it. It is, afterall, hair that will grow back. im just tired of it.
Speaking of tired...bed sounds really good, so, thats where im going."

"event","So I went out on a limb and bought some Pringles. It's a new flavor. Loaded baked potato. Im not impressed. I think someone WAS loaded when they made these. Not only do they really not taste like a baked potato, they're mostly just really salty, as usual for pringles, and unusually paper thin. If you're not careful with them, they'll crumble all over you. I've never head of a dainty potato chip, until now. This is why I normally stick to Lay's Stax. A good solid chip with more flavor than salt.
I think there's a reason limbs branch out. It's so people wont go out on them. Oh sure we know better, but do we obey that law? No. Because we're people, and people are stupid and insist that things are changable.
I really hope my CD's come soon. I SO cant wait for the Buble cd that I never knew existed.
I just hope its not a live cd. I dont much care for those. It didnt say it was live, but you never know with these things. Now all's I gotta do is order one cd at regular price and I get 4 more free* (S&H of course). However, picking out a cd that I really wanna pay full price for is another thing entirely.
Shit, I had a hard enough time picking out 7 free* ones."

"event","okay, so im checking my email, even the junk file, and im noticing, Yahoo! has managed to break the Time/Space barrier, because im already getting emails from sunday, april 2nd. Is that wild or what?
So, I went and joined BMG for the 12 for 1 deal~you know, where you pick out 7 cd's for ""free"", buy one at regular price in a year and then pick 4 more for ""free"". I say ""free"" because you have to pay shipping and handeling, which, for 7 cd's came out to 18 bucks. Not a bad deal, considering most cd's cost that much just for one in the mall. So I got a few cd's that my apartment has eaten in the last few years, such as My beloved Tracy Bonham cd. You know, you cant find that cd (the burdens of being upright) in any store in any mall now? And then I had to get the 2 disc Evita set. Oh Evita, how you mocked me! See, years ago, I found a copy of disc one just laying around the apartment (I think it belonged to a friend who had moved out, so I asked her, and she bought a new one, so she said I could have it), but I wanted the 2nd disc, so, I set out to purchase the 2 disc set from work. It was the only copy they had, so, yay me, right? WRONG! I was all excited opening it up. I peeled off that annoying plastic shit and pried off the security stickers and I opened it up, and what do I find?
2 BLOODY COPIES OF DISC ONE!
You better believe I returned that mother fucker.
I also got the greatest hits of The Guess Who. not The Who. The Guess Who. I love them, mostly because of my dad, who was a TGW freak. Oh! and the Brigadoon soundtrack, for the raging homo inside me! Or...the raging girly girl inside me...uh....this is ending badly...so, im just gonna end it here."

"event","so, okay, not much to update, other than the fact that I have a Myspace, to which i've boldly added to pics of me, both a bit old, but it's still me, without the glasses.
I think...I want to start going to the local gym to work out, exercise, lose this weight.
No real hijinks to report...hmmm, unless you count the near death experiance at work on monday.
I'm pretty sure that anyone that has worked in retail knows what endcaps and pegboards are.
Well,during back to school, we ALWAYS have endcaps of shower curtain liners, on pegs (hooked into the pegboard of course).So anyway, it was full up, and one of my co-workers was bent in front of it, stocking the bottom shelves, and I was moving in to help, when all of a sudden, I heard this creaking and low rumbling. The next thing I know, the pegboard, full of shower curtain liners came flying forward, damn near on top of my co-workers head! Luckily he moved just in time. So there we were, with a broken pegboard and probably a good 500 liners on the floor everywhere. I tell ya, we should get hazard pay.
So thats my excitement for the week. Sad isnt it?"

Fuck you right back (F.U.R.B.) by Frankee:

 
Oh oh

See I don't know why you cryin' like a bitch

You wouldn't wanna share

Now you want me to come back 
You must be smokin' crack

Fuck all those nights I moaned real loud 
Fuck it, I faked it, aren't you proud 
Fuck all those nights you thought you broke my back 
Well guess what yo, your sex was wack

I can't swear bad cause I got to go 

Fuck what I did was your fault somehow 
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out 
Fuck all the cryin' you didn't mean jack 
Well guess what yo, fuck you right back.

 
Okay, so im easily amused!
My neice made a mixed cd for me last year and its got all kinds of stuff on it, including the above two songs. There's also this ""Spanish commands"" thing on there, where its this learn to speak spanish type thing, only its cursing and stuff. Funny shit."

Would things be as they are now, or would things have evolved further? It's amazing how one life can change the entire world. The world is a strange place, and as I heard someone say once, Time, and Chance happeneth to us all."

Michael Buble, whom I just love love love, will be coming to the Fox Theatre in Detroit for one night.
The problem is, one ticket is anywhere from $65 to $100!
It's been a long time since i've been to a concert, or even found anyone I was even remotely interested seeing in concert...but now, there he is in all his glory...and the stupid Fox has to go and set his tickets too high!
Grr. Argh.

In other news of my three medical bills, one is completely paid off, another is about to be paid off and the last has a couple hundred to go. Bills Bills Bills. You know, I really hate that word.
I had a friend named Bill once, and since he's been out of my life, that word haunts me.
I've got so many bills it makes me fuckin sick!

"event","I will be SO happy when I get all my medical bills paid off! I'm nearly finished with two of the three that I have, owing only $22 on one and $63 on the other. The third bill I still owe 450 some dollars (down from the original almost $900 that it was). It'll be so nice not to have to fork out $145 every month in medical bills on top of rent and cell phone and other such bills.
Let me tell ya, every penny counts.I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel there, and I just have to keep telling myself that I'm almost done and that I can make it. Of course, I can put some of my tax return money toward paying that third bill off, knock it down to $200 maybe. Some of it will be for spending on more shit I dont need, and vacation money, but the rest will go toward a very special fund thats Top Secret. I didnt make that much this year though, so, I hope I get enough back in taxes.
Blah! I'm so sick of money already!"

"event","So my roommate (syphilitic whore that she is) gave me this idea. I was pointing out the tour stereotypes and myths that I always see in stories and find hilarious, but since most fannish authors have never been on tour, they would have no idea what's what. 

So.

Ask me your questions. Any question at all. And if I can answer it, I will. This isn't f-locked, so feel free to send other people over here. 

I don't know. I thought it would be something to past the time and to maybe help neaten up all those little details."

"event","still safe - this place is built like a fortress. we're watching them pour out from city center on the news. the people running, the idiots who are trying to drive. the trains stopped running an hour ago. 

we haven't seen any here yet, but we can see them on the tv. it's on mute, because no one can possibly have anything worth saying anymore. <i>""stay inside, lock the doors and windows. the police will take care of it. the army is coming, the government has everything under control.""</i> 

i guess they haven't seen all the fuckers with badges and useless camouflage wandering around with their throats torn out. 

we can hear them outside. the wind and the lake carry the sound, so it's hard to tell how close they are. i've got a baseball bat and a will to survive, but I don't know how useful it will be. the people behind us are crying, and we try not to let them see how our hands shake."

"event","campus is empty. i can see a bicycle lying in the middle of the street from my window. car horns and sirens from downtown, and the sound of gunfire below 61st. 

I've tried calling C and M and everyone, but no one's answering. The news is on in the lounge, and they're throwing around all sorts of crazy theories. No one's said the z-word yet, but we're all thinking it. 

at least I've got my survival handbook.

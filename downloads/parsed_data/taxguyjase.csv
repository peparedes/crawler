"event","Two questions-

I'm looking to sell an elliptical trainer - a Horizon LS625E Elliptical.  This is a great elliptical trainer. Bought it new back in April, but have only used it a few times - just never had the time. Works well and doesn't take up very much space. Retail on it was $550, I'd like $250.  Let me know if you're interested - I would like to make some space in my living room!

Also, I'm looking for a new primary care physician - I'm on Presybterian insurance.  I'd like someone a bit younger, preferably in the NE Heights.  Does anyone have any suggestions?"

"event","So, we had a staff meeting today.  There was a deal on recruiting, which I'm involved with.  I made a statement that didn't come out of my mouth the way I expected it to.

The process is a bit odd - we have an idea of who we want to hire before they actually come in to the office.  It's somewhat of a formality.  On top of it, the possible recruits all come at different times - so some of the ones we do want to hire come in after some of the ones that are effectively ""backups"".  Not a nice way of saying it, but that's how it is.

Anyway, I meant to say in the meeting:

""For example, <this person> came in later, but was offered a job regardless of the timing of when she came.""

What I actually said:

""We went through eight people before <this person> accepted with us.""

Fuck...that was terrible."

"event","So, Tina and I got a call from the cruise line for our little Hawaiian cruise in August.  Apparently, they needed/wanted to fill the suites and they made us an offer we couldn't refuse.  Suffice it to say, we got a pretty sweet deal on the penthouse suite.

As part of that, we get a butler!  I'm wondering what he'll buttle.  Perhaps he can make me a delicious dirty gin martini...tasty.

"event","So, I rented ""Resistance: Fall of Man"" on PS3 the other day.  A couple of observations:

1) I apparently don't play the first person shooters as often as I would care to because I had difficulty controlling the damn controller.  My pee-sized brain has trouble with ""move left AND right at the same time""

2) Damn, that's a hard game when the EASY difficulty still gets your ass whipped.

2a) However, apparently on EASY, friendly fire is not an option, so I could shoot Kevin and vice versa and we wouldn't be SOL.

3) It's way cool with two players and you can yell ""COVER THE RIGHT!  COVER FIRE!!!"" without looking crazy.

4) There's nothing like blowing up zombie-alien-dudes with a big ass rocket launcher or running them over with a Jeep.

All that in the glory of 720P.  Gotta love the HD."

"event","Woo boy!  I'm feeling really intense today...damn, I'm feeling good.  We had this big tax meeting today going over <lj-cut text=""extended tax services""> See, we're not like H & R Block (who incidentially, owns the firm that we are a network member of, but I digress).  While we do prepare tax returns, we do tax projects that further reduce our clients' tax liability.  These include cost segregation studies (my favorite), business valuations, state and local tax studies, etc...  Basically, we do the returns and more shit to maximize tax savings and money in our pocket.  Good times.</lj-cut>.  Anyway, I'm getting really involved with marketing cost segregation studies and getting new clients and it's feeling really damn good. 

There's a possibility that our firm will be contracted to assist McGladery with their cost segregation studies.  If that's the case, we may get to do some work with the big Las Vegas casinos and other clients that we don't have in New Mexico (which, if it ain't government or healthcare, then we ain't got it).  So, yea, I'm getting really excited.  Plus, I'm going to assist with training new tax and audit staff.  That's fun too.

I'm really happy that I'm really enjoying my work.  I had a short stint this summer where I hated my job and wanted to quit and go work for <a href=""http://www.sandia.gov/"">Sandia National Laboratories</a>, but I'm really glad that I didn't.  That would have sucked considerable ass...would have been bored out of my mind.  I plan on sticking with <a href=""http://www.neffcpa.com/"">Neff + Ricci</a> for the long haul and get up to Partner.  That would rock and I like having clients.  

We heard back from the poodle foster mom.  We'll talk to them tomorrow and see what they have to say.  One of them sounds like she'd be perfect for us and Alex.  But we'll see.

Up to nearly $1,000 on The Half.  If you like anime, there's an awesome Techni Universe box set up there (under the name of tinakitty2001) and a very cool Martian Successor Nadesico box set.  So, buy one of them...damnit.

IT IS NOT FUN WHEN YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING!

Crikey, this project sucks.  I can't wait to get it done.  Maybe I'll look back at it later and say ""wow, I sure did learn a lot""...hopefully...

I love <a href=""http://www.half.com"">The Half</a>....it's a great thing.  So far, up to about $800 of sales, including a book that I swore I would never be rid of and a bunch of DVD sets that have been collecting dust for a while (I can say that I have seen nearly every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer now, though).

It's like the calm before the storm...tax season is about two weeks away or so.  It'll be nice to be billable and what not, but the hours are going to suck a bit.  Crappy.

We're going to Phoenix this weekend - I'm not sure what we're going to do, but it should be fun.  I've heard Tina and her folks go shopping a lot.  I have a feeling I will be bag-guy (not that there's a problem with that - it's a good work out :)  I heard something about a lake too...jetskis, perhaps?

I love half.com now (actually, I call it ""The Half"")!

I've sold like $300 of stuff so far.  DEBT BE GONE!  I hadn't even thought about doing that.  Weird.  I'm glad Tina brought it up.

Work is going extremely slow...I can't focus and we're only workign until noon today, b/c we have a server conversion going on and then a big firm meeting.

"event","Crikey, this has been a long weekend...

Thursday - There's a client at work who is a couple in Florida...they were referred by one of my co-workers who has since moved to the audit department.  Long story short - the tax return has been passed between about four people and landed on my desk in October.  Chaos - drama - confusion - anger.  All were felt as I tried desperately to get this thing out of my hair and back to the client before 5pm.

Didn't happen...but that's ok because new information has made it not as bad as it was on Thursday...still, Thursday sucked since I was supposed to have the day off and ended up working the whole time.

Friday - Not as bad, but I still had to get up and count cars in the cold from 8am - 1pm.  That sucked.  Then we moved Tina to the new apartment, which went a lot faster/easier than I could have expected.  It helped we had a big hitch trailer and a bunch of people.  We then played poker from 9pm to 5am...that was a long...long game.  I think that next time we'll play Omaha Hold-em or do something different so that we don't repeat the 8 hour game.  It was fun, but we're very tired.  Got a bit drunk too...not doing that again.

Saturday - the ill-fated Angelfire trip.  Long long story short - tried to inner-tube, couldn't, ended up going to another hill, Tina got attacked by a tube and a car (unfortunately, she took all the beatings), we all almost got food poisoning (one of us actually did), and we dealt with the bitchiest waitress EVER.  So, not going to Angelfire again.  Luckily, we had a good time with each other, which is the important thing.

Sunday - We moved more and had to move the BIG TV.  BIG TV weighs like 300 lbs.  Finally got that and all the electronics hooked up and watched ""Garden State"" which was an interesting movie.  I still have to watch ""Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"" due to a bad bet (that Kerry would win the election) and taking Tina to a bad movie (Team America: World Police).

Tina and I had a conversion about faith.  I've had to question some of my beliefs, partially because my experience with faith stopped at age 10 or 11.  I don't think that our beliefs are that far off...I think that I am not very attached to my beliefs and need to think about those attachments.  I think that it's important that our future kids get raised with parents who are on the same page or at least understand how the kids are going to be raised, if there happens to be a disagreement, and follow that understanding.  The Lutheran Church requires that Tina and I meet with the pastor 3 times and discuss these issues.  I think that will really help because I know that with me, sometimes I need another voice to reiterrate what I've heard (Not because I'm not listening, but sometimes different words saying the same thing hit home more effectively and I, in a sense, ""get it"").  I really want this to work...I could feel it from when we first started dating.  I love Tina with all my heart.

Unfortunately, I'm sick and all this insightful-thinking isn't helping (when reality is shaken for me, I tend to get a bit of an upset stomach.).  But it's getting better as I think more about it."

"event","Crikey, I'm not even an officer and those initiations are still damn stressful.

Every semester, Beta Alpha Psi (the group I used to be president of) has a member initiation.  As an officer, I helped put on four of them...not very fun and a whole lot of stress.  Last night was not an exception.  Professionals came without RSVPing, electrical cords didn't fit into sockets, microphone feedback, people left without paying, etc...  Lots of little drama that added up quick.

But damn, it was fun.  Afterwards, Tina, myself, Steve, Felicia, Louis, Jenny and Jackie went out for drinks at Martini Grille.  Damn, that place is expensive.  Steve, Felicia, Tina and I drank about $98 (with tip and tax).  Crap, drinking at home is like five time as effective and a tenth of the price.  Steve only had two drinks, which for him, is like a first.  There was a party for a gay guy next to us...I haven't seen that much man-on-man love ever...nor do I ever want to see it again.  Blah.  It seems like whenever we're at places like that, I hear the words ""super"", ""fabulous"" and ""oh, girlfriend!"" quite a bit.

Tina and I cleaned a lot...it's nice living in a clean house.  Alex has decided to play in the mud and comes in with a brown nose a lot, which is kinda funny."

"event","So, I just need to let this set in:

I have one last day of school before I graduate with my Masters of Accountancy degree...

That means no more tax research papers, no tax memos, no BS HR-crap presentations, no group projects from hell that I don't get paid for...NO MORE FREAKING SCHOOL!!!!

Damn, I'm happy about that.  I can't wait to have weekends back again.  It's been hard trying to balance everything and get things I want to get done when school is in the way.  After 5.5 years of college, I will look forward to the break.

Of course, this break happens right before tax season, where I'll be working 50-60 hours a week...good timing brainiac.  Crikey."

"event","Yes, quite a nice day, don't you think?

This is my first entry and damn, it's going to be somewhat uneventful.

Here's a brief summary of me: I'm a 23 year old CPA who is getting married to the lovely Tina on May 20, 2005.  I went to the University of New Mexico for my undergraduate and graduate degrees, both of which were in accounting.  I do a bunch of tax stuff in my job.  It's fun.

Ah, really, I don't have much else to write now...will do so when things happen.

Good times

Jase"

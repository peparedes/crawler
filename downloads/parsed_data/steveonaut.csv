"event","so i was talking with John, another teacher, just now online and he put in my birthday data and something interesting happened.

I'm not a Libra.

I'm a Virgo.

the sun moved into Libra at 6:00am on September 23rd 1983.  I was born at 12:42am on the 23rd.

i don't know how to feel about this.

this is my horoscope for today:

Fair weather        
There are wounds that do not heal with time. Instead they start hurting again given certain ""weather conditions"". If this occurs, subconsciously we will withdraw into ourselves in interpersonal situations, or be oversensitive and react in a hurt manner without apparent reason - or we ourselves become particularly hurtful, without actually wanting to. However, if the weather is fair, as it is now, you have the opportunity to bring these painful things to light - preferably during a personal conversation with someone who is close to you. Looking into painful experiences in this way can make you freer in your behavior, your close relationships and your relation with your body. It can also prevent you from hurting others.

that sounds so serious. i have this sinking feeling in my stomach like something has happened.  my third eye has seen something.  

what do i do now?"

"event","I am in Thailand!

how crazy is that?  I'm on my three week break from work and decided to come over here and visit Lia, who has been living and teaching preschool here for a few months.

so far, first impressions of Bangkok.... this is a ridiculous city.  It is intense on so many levels.  it is hot, humid, polluted.... there are still some amazing things happening here though.  

Yesterday I walked around a part of the city alone.  I got lost a few times and spent about 5 hours walking around outside.  I think what the combination of all the factors resulted in is a feeling of muted claustrophobia, where I felt trapped, though I knew I was outside.  My muscles ached and my head throbbed..  my feet were filthy and sweat poured a constant stream down my body.  It wasn't until I stopped at a petrol station to get some water, that I realized how out of sorts I was.   

I regrouped and headed down to one of the indoor shopping centers where it was cool and I could rest with some lunch.  The food is difficult to understand.  especially not wanting to eat any of the meat.  I walked around for a while, trying to find something I could be sure was safe to eat.  I ended up going to exactly the same place Lia took me a few days before for lunch.  

I feel a bit frazzled.  and defeated.  

I'm going out again today for some more adventure while Lia is at work.  i was looking all day yesterday for a bike shop where i could buy a simple little thing to ride around the city-I have a feeling it will be entirely more easy and fun to get around the city like that.  I remember when I got my bike in Brighton-it felt so good to ride it around, down near the beach with my new friends.... and yesterday on the cab ride home, I think i saw a place selling used bikes, and I think I even remember where it is.  I guess we'll see what happens huh?"

today we buried Lolo.&nbsp; 

there was a short mass and then a military color guard folded a flag and played taps.&nbsp; it was beautiful.&nbsp; it was sad.&nbsp; each of the kids rested a flower on the coffin and said goodbye.&nbsp; it was difficult to do.&nbsp; i still expect to go back to his room and see him sleeping, with south park playing on the TV in the background.&nbsp; people said a lot of things about him.&nbsp; i wish he could have been there to hear what people were saying and mumble to himself how it was all bullshit. he hated the way people talked about others after they had died-he thought it was lame how everybody who dies automatically becomes a great person.

i miss his honesty.&nbsp; i miss his asshole remarks and passive aggressive silence.&nbsp; i miss his stories-the ones that i know he is going to tell; the ones i've heard so many times over.&nbsp; i miss how he always would undo his seatbelt exactly two blocks before we got home, every time.&nbsp; i miss how music sounds when you are listening to it with him.&nbsp; it was the only time he could express emotions, but it was never with words.&nbsp; if you listened to the music, and watched him listen, you could understand how it made him feel and how it fueled his life.&nbsp; every memory he had was immersed in the context of a song.&nbsp; my favorite memories of him are moments when we were listening to music and there was something special about a song-the way the saxophone solo sounded or how the trombone player tailgated the whole thing.&nbsp; we would look at each other and, without words, would understand and start grinning like a couple of idiots.&nbsp;

"event","last night was insanity. it was so so much fun

It has been a long week here on the ranch and all the teachers were completely exhausted.  After an tiring morning of playing with toddlers, acting like chickens, planting bone trees and spraying ourselves with milk, we spent the final two hours of our work day hauling loads of wood chips up and down the hill into the garden.  I was, so tired.

but instead of taking a reasonable nap or something, we all piled into the back of Sarah's volvo station wagon (affectionately named Alberta) and headed north, along the windy roads into Stinson beach.  The plan was to get ice cream and beer and to go enjoy it on the beach..in the freezing cold weather.. it seemed like a good idea at the time.  but as we roamed the isles of the tiny grocery store and surveyed the prices of the objects for sale, our excitement slowly began to fade.  

we are not used to buying things.  we don't really have the money to do it and most of the time, we don't have to.  our kitchen is packed full of amazing food.

but we weren't leaving that store empty handed.  we figured 5 bucks from each person would buy a large bottle of medium-quality whiskey.  so we headed out to the small, wealthy, hippie loving town of Bolinas to check out the beach.

At this point, the sun had been down for a little while and the last of the surfers were removing themselves from the chilly waters.  we were cold and unprepared.  but we found a small nook just around the bend of a hill, alongside a cement wall littered with colorful murals.  

things started out simple enough; singing songs, making up little raps and howling to the stars.    and passing the whiskey around. 

it is so amazing how connected we teachers all are and how we have changed so much by being here on slide and by spending so much time with children, expanding our imaginations.  i noticed that last night-one person would act something out or make an animal noise, the next thing i know we are all huddled underneath Kiva, warming ourselves, each singing our own song about cloacas.  

the night was pretty random and bounced around a lot.  it got darker and colder, the bottle of whiskey was eventually drained and the tide almost cut off our escape route.  in a fit of madness or something, we all shed our clothing and ran shouting into the freezing cold water laughing like mad people.  This was something new for me.  I know it sounds weird, but it was so much fun.  it was the last thing any of us probably wanted to do, but it was the first thing  in our minds.  a naked swim at 9:00 in freezing waters of a public beach-running around and whooping at the top of our lungs. it was so innocent, so pure, so much fun..

the funny thing is that we act like this when we are sober (except for the naked thing).  we are becoming children again.  ideas bounce around constantly and we break into song often.  we read bedtime stories together and curl up like puppies to sleep.  we give the biggest hugs to each other every time we meet.  we do arts and crafts and play tag and that one game when the ground is lava, you know?  we go on adventures and build forts, captain space ships across the galaxy and make puns about compost.  we are a litter of kids, bound together by the direction we are growing and the wonder that this place and the visiting children are infusing into our lives.

i am truly grateful."

"event","i spent the morning blissfully laying in the sun, counting birds and watching clouds...

I spent lunchtime with some of the teachers down on the beach, flying rocket ships of sand into uncharted reaches of the galaxy and then dancing on the beach in-between momentary dunks into the chilly waters...

I spent the afternoon in the pasture with the ruminants, being a pillow for the baby kids and spending time with my favorite little kid.

I feel like i'm turning back into a kid.  I'm rarely serious and i sing songs that i make up in my head to the plants and animals.  I teach again tomorrow.  I can't wait.  children are amazing.  i'm learning so much."

Other than that, a bunch of not-so-good things happened back home.  one of the neighbors snitched and now the city knows of my 6 month project.  as a result, there are no horses there and won't be for a long time-BUMMER.  for a little while i was so angry because i felt like i just wasted the last 6 months of my life, ruining things i was looking forward to and put all this money into something that is just going to sit there and look pretty... but it is hard to stay angry wen i'm in such a beautiful place, with such beautiful people.  things seem to roll off the shoulders like  tennis balls on a sunny afternoon, and i'm glad to let them.  nothing is ruined.  i feel like all the work i've done will pay off in some way, to somebody at some point in the future.  i'm much too busy living simply to be worried about what i cannot control.  i'm having fun."

"event","in a way, i feel reborn.  in a way, parts of me are scattered about in places far away, though i'm learning to live with and patch those empty places.

it's hard for me to describe how incredible this week has been.  mostly the days are filled with learning.  all us teachers have to learn how to do everything on the ranch and there is a system to all the different little parts.  I, along with the other 6 teachers, are feeling a bit overwhelmed... but at the same time we are all still in complete shock that we are doing the things we are doing in the amazing place we are.  The more I learn about this ranch, the more i fall in love.  and i am in deep so far.  

i wake up every morning to the sound of waves crashing on the rocks below the cliffs that drop off just past the ocean house.  I am in a small cabin that keeps me warm and dry at night.  it's just the right size.  The window facing the ocean stretches from one wall to the other and I watch tankers travel from the san francisco bay out to the ocean and off into the horizon as i get ready for my day.  

The kitchen is quirky, clean and completely full with food all the time-really really good food.  My body has forgotten how to tell me I am full and i usually end up eating until i feel my stomach stretching.  All of the teachers are amazing, genuine people and we are all connecting so so well.  I'm making friends so fluidly, and i feel so comfortable all of the time.  I can't remember a time when it was just so easy to be myself-and it's flowing over into non-ranch life.  I spent today in the city with a new friend who showed me some of her most favorite places to see-alley ways with intricate wall murals, burrito shops with killer veggie burritos-we even snuck into a fancy hotel to check out an amazing view of the city through the backside of the glass elevators at 30 stories up.  I'm finding myself so confident and content with myself that talking with people is just so easy.

..but the ranch life is really so much more than i imagined.  I am learning to be silly around people-i am letting down my guard and making silly gestures and noises for little games in front of people i hardly know.  I am learning about gardening and compost, cheese making and milking, chickens, food and the connection between them all.  this ranch is our home.  we are stewards for the national parks service and we invite these kids to our home to get dirty, run around and let their creativity and imagination explode!

and the other night i milked a goat and fed goat kids from a bottle at 10:00 at night and it made me so happy.  so much makes me happy these days (especially compost and the worm song).  i am writing more and more about the small things that happen every day.  today was especially good.  i took an amazing drive with ryan out to some remote dairy farms along the coast in search of a good surfing spot.  we saw elk and cows tending to their newborn calfs.  we listened to great great music, talked  and went surfing in the hail.  i'm trying to slow myself down, exist in the moment and take everything in as much as i can.  i'm finding it easy.  things are so fluid now.  it has only been a week but i feel things coming together like i never have before.  i am definitely where i need to be."

a friend once told me that a good way to get yourself to do something that is hard for you to do is to back yourself into a corner so you have no choice and are forced to.  

i guess i sometimes do just that.  

there is still so much to do though so much has already been done.  i will probably be up all night, tying up the final loose ends.

Steve, 
All paths lead nowhere.
The question is does it have heart?
You have heart, deep from your parents,

give you strength.

"event","For the past three years Jason, Jolene and Monroe stop by for the night on their way back up to Oakland from a two week trip to Mexico.  They dropped in Saturday night and it made me so happy to see them.  They are always so happy and fun to be around and they both give really amazing hugs.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/steveonaut2/JJ.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket"">

so we went out for pizza and beers.  we talked about my new job and they told me about what they know of the area.  They told me of this bar in the Muir woods, nestled among the redwood forest, that you can only get to by hiking.  It sounds so enchanted.  They'll probably come up the first weekend i'm there so we can see this place.  i'm very excited.

They left sunday morning after taking me out for waffles.

I got a call from them a few hours after they left.

""Hey, what's up?  Is everything okay?"" I say

""Steve, Jolene and I needed to call you to say we just ate the best fucking orange of our lives.""
(we picked a bag of the navel oranges that are just coming into season here on the ranch)

""Oh that's awesome, I'm glad you like them,"" I say.

""No, steve, i'm serious, that was the best orange of my life.  I was sitting here and it struck me that at some point we are going to run out of these, so you should bring more when you move up here.""

That was a very good phone call.  The oranges this year are pretty incredible.  I can't eat one without getting weak in the knees and bursting out in song.  They are good.  I will miss them too."

"event","This morning I got up early.  The mornings are always hard.  If I wake up my thoughts play tricks on me as they tumble around while I toss and turn and I can't seem to get back to sleep.  I wiped my dry-erase calendar clean of September plans that never materialized and started in on ideas for what will be the final push towards completion of all my projects-the culmination of three years work.  The deadline is clear and stands out a bright red against the white calendar background.  January 28th.  That is move-in day on Slide Ranch.  ""So what of slide ranch?"" you are probably thinking.. well,

First of all, they have their own website: <a href=""www.slideranch.org"">www.slideranch.org</a>
 

I accepted their offer for a 10 1/2 month teacher in residence position.  Basically, I will be living on this small farm on Muir beach in a community with about 15 other young, motivated people who make it their business to live and share the philosophy of simple, sustainable living.  I, along with about 6 others, will be in charge of teaching people that come to the ranch about the basics of farm life, like... where our food comes from and what it takes for things to grow, what a goat is and how do you get milk from one, how milk becomes cheese, why insects are so cool and vital-things like that.  I will also be taking kids on nature walks around the ranch and down to the tide pools with campfires in the summertime as well.  

They say the average age of kids that visit the ranch is 7 (second grade).  They are mostly day-field trips from local schools in low-income neighborhoods.  I talked to a teacher from last year who told me that they get some kids from San Francisco neighborhoods that have never even seen the ocean!  I feel really good about this job because I think the kinds of connections I will help these kids make are so small that they are often overlooked but so important for a solid, balanced, developing view of how the world works.

I have also been getting very excited about meeting and getting to know the people I will be living and working with.  I would say that, more than anything right now, is what keeps me going day-to-day.  I'm trying to go into this without any expectations, but I feel like these other teachers are going to be really cool, down to earth, people who love being outside, working hard and teaching.  Those are really just prerequisites for wanting the job in the first place so I don't think they are unreasonable desires on my part, right?

I just got back Tuesday from my first visit to the ranch and surrounding Marin County area.  I asked Lia if she would accompany me on my trip and she agreed.  Lia is the one who brought my attention to the craig's list job posting in an email she sent with the subject line ""DO IT""-a serious statement from a person who is usually fundamentally opposed to using all capital letters.  I also remembered how passionately she spoke of her lone visit to that part of the state in June.  I also thought it would be a good chance for the both of us to get away from our present situations and maybe try for a better sense of how and why things are the way they are now because lately i've just been so confused.

The trip was, I am happy to say, really great; a success on many levels.  I got to see where I am going to be living and working and I met some of the permanent residents that keep the place up and running all the time.  We stayed in a unique little hostel and went on some fantastic hikes to abandoned military outposts and dynamic, grassy cliff sides wrapped in sunshine, littered with the tracks of wild animals and opposed by a a powerful, mineral blue ocean bursting with inspiration.  

We made a decision to leave the drama and the past behind us, if only for a few days and to live in the moments that surrounded us.  Sometimes it's hard to feel which direction, and under whose influence, pressure comes to us.  So we got lost in this trip from the things that were behind us and the things that were ahead of us.  We laughed and talked and read and wrote, hiked and drove and ate very good food.  We relaxed at her parents and had an amazing Italian dinner with them.  In the spirit of letting things go and opening new doors, I ate some fish-and it wasn't a big deal.  I kinda liked it.  We danced to good live music and rang in the new year with an episode of futurama and a short, cold trip outside to hear everyone yelling, setting off fireworks and shooting their guns in the air.

I have this idealistic theory that if I could just understand something as much as I could, then i couldn't possibly feel bad about it.  I'm learning that's not always the case, but I do feel like I understand things better now and it is a little easier.  I know that, more than anything, we are just really good friends that still, in most cases, see the world in a very similar light.  We are both at very similar, life-defining places in our lives but they are distinct and cannot be made the same.  I have a lot of growing to do on my own before I'm ready for those big relationship things I was preparing for.  I need to be around children and learn from them how to see the world with excitement, curiosity and without hatred.  I need to not be so serious all the time.  I just need to get away, start something completely new and get lost in that.

I have begun to more fully accept the way things are right now.  Though it is so very hard for me and feels awkward and unnatural, I am beginning to let go of what I have found it impossible to let alone for more than mere moments at a time.  Sometimes it takes the honesty and simplicity of something like a Woodie Guthrie song to help with accepting what i can't find the strength to accept.

 ""why, oh why, oh why, oh why"" 
   why, oh why, oh why?

  because, because, because, because 

  goodbye goodbye, goodbye.""

I am leaving soon.  I've taken the job up north (i'll write more about that tomorrow).  I will miss days like tomorrow.  I'm going to miss a lot of things.  I'd like to say I'm getting better at coping with loss but i don't think i'll ever be better at that.  maybe that's okay.

..there are some things I get teary eyed just thinking about:

-drinking whiskey with my grandpa and listening to his stories that go on for a long time.  
-helping lolo get up in the morning.
-surfing with chris at ungodly hours
-My grandma's nervousness.
-Listening to Lolo's stories-the ones I know by heart because he's told them so many times.  I still love to hear them and i've come to learn the right questions-the ones that make him light up.
-my grandpa's sayings, like:
    ""be careless""
    ""don't do anything i wouldn't do but if you do, do it twice.""
    ""I've cut this damn thing twice and it's <i>still</i> too short.""
    ""no music, can't dance, might as well.""
-Playing music with chris in the garage before bedtime.
-My grandma always trying to get me to smile.
-chris's awkward jokes and loud laugh.  and his optimism-it's so strong it blows me away.
-the pooch
  


oh my God, that was so hard to write.  i've been a wreck lately.


 i have a month left here.  I haven't listened to music with Lolo in a long time.  I haven't listened to nearly enough of Pa's intricate stories.  I haven't smiled enough for my grandma.  I haven't played enough songs with chris.  i don't feel ready but i know i need to go.  i don't feel ready but I'm going either way."

""It's a Wonderful Life"" was on tv tonight.  it really is a great movie.  It has been too long since i've seen it.

I broke ground today on the last leg of my barn project.  I have been working on this for 6 months.  That's too long. I feel like I should have been out of here by now.  People have been waiting on me and this has just dragged on.  I feel really bad about that.  It pains me.  

This last part should take only a few weeks.  I'm on schedule to be done before the new year.  There really isn't anything glamorous about this kind of work.  It's hard, gives me blisters and I can't really be too expressive with it-there will be no subtle messages sent, no inside jokes or harmonizing.  But I am proud of the work I have done.  It will be glamorous to me once i've finished.  And then i'm leaving.  It was put best by George Baley: 

""What are the three most exciting sounds in the world?  Train whistles, anchor chains and airplane motors."" 

I think the work I've done will help me see more of the world.  That was the hope all along.  

It is time to shake the dust of this crummy little town from my feet."

They were playing bingo, making stamps, singing karaoke, and making cookies with frosting and sprinkles.  It was good to be out, among all the smiling, punch-stained lips.  I was in a good place, handing out nachos and chocolate cake.  It is very very good to be around children.  One girl made me a cookie with blue frosting and sprinkles.  I almost cried, it was so sweet (the gesture, not the cookie).  

I talked to some really interesting people from my dad's work that remembered me from last year.  I now have a standing invitation to visit Israel.  There is a lot of community farming going on there.. something to keep in the back of my mind as i try and figure out what to do in the coming months.  

I had dinner afterward with my father.  It's good to talk with him.

Sometimes I like to make the setup for ridiculous puns so my dad can make the delivery..  It's usually very obvious but one of my favorite things about my dad is his ability to constantly make people laugh/groan with his puns.  I'll use any chance I can get to facilitate that."

"event","i'm turning in my astronaut application tonight.  I used to be really into the idea of being an astronaut.  I think I still am.  NASA is taking applications for the first time in over 30 years... 

Though I am excited about the idea of being an astronaut, I am pretty excited about this job that I interviewed for last weekend where I would work with kids and animals in a garden on the side of  a hill along the coast.  I think I need something like that in my life.  A bit of hard work <i>with</i> other young, enthusiastic people.. and maybe some peace and quiet on the weekends.  I still need to find out the things in life which I am to focus my energy.

A few months ago my mom told me a story about when I was a baby.  One of my dad's aunt's, Louise, used to read tea leaves.  She stopped when one day she foresaw the death of one of her daughters who, incidentally, did die.  My parents took me to visit her when I was a baby.  The way my mom explained it, Louise took my mom aside, looked her straight in the eyes and told her that I was a very special baby and that I was meant to do great things for the world.  

As my mom told me this story, she began to cry uncontrollably.  She kept hugging me and telling me that she loved me.  It was so strange, I had never seen her like that before.  

I keep saying that I want to do great things.  I don't know what the hell I'll actually do.  It would be fun to think that I was destined to accomplish some great feat, to be remembered for some act or some creation of my own.  I'm sure everybody feels like that.  It makes me feel silly.  It seems like these days ""great things"" amount to acting in a series of movies about funny situations, relationships that turn out perfectly or epic characters from a long time ago.  I just want to do something and stop thinking of actions as possessing greatness or varying degrees of insignificance.  

I feel like I need some guidance."

"event","well, the swell was big.  very big.  

It took me 30 minutes of constant paddling and fighting with the waves to paddle out past where they were breaking.  The tide had pulled me down about half a mile by then.  The board hit me in the nose and I lost track of Chris.  Turns out, Chris didn't even make it out there-this was the case with about half the surfers that were crazy enough to try that day.

I caught my first 14 foot wave.  I caught it just before it broke, when it was steep.  I dropped in and kept dropping in.  As I rode down the face of the wave it began to tower more and more over my head until it was about three times my height.  I turned and rode along the face going fast.  It was like on those videos of crazy waves in exotic places.  When I would paddle over the top of them, the wind would blow huge swarms of mist and foam another 10 feet in the air.  It was like taking a huge breath of the freshest air.  It felt so surreal.  They were rolling in constantly.

Things got scary a short time after I paddled out again.  A big wave crashed right on top of me and I lost the grip on my board.  I made it to the surface fine but when I looked around for my board, it was nowhere.  I tugged on the leash.  Nothing.  Another wave crashed on me.  My wet suit filled with water as I tried to tread water.  The thing that I learned real quick about big waves is that they pull you under after they crash and hold you down as if to overemphasize the point that I was completely at their mercy.  And they kept coming.  Reach the surface, get a few breaths and then back under the water for at least ten seconds; and the pattern repeated.  I began to swim the hundred or so yards back to the shore during my moments above water.  After a good ten minutes of swimming, I crawled onto the shore and flopped down on my back to catch my breath.  Someone passing by had picked up my board and laid it next to me.  I got up and walked down the beach to find Chris sitting on the sand, watching the waves.  

We were passed by an old man who was following his wife who was walking her dog.  He looked at us, grinned and said:

""Enjoy this kid of stuff while you're young.  When you get to be old like me you carry around little bags of shit.""

He wagged the small, black, plastic bag that he had been carrying.  Chris and I laughed, loud and awkwardly.  He walked on down the beach.  Chris and I looked at each other.  Maybe that's what happens when your old.  Maybe if you find the right person, little bags of shit don't seem to matter.  Maybe all old people just get tired of their spouses at some point.  Or maybe... maybe you just do the things that excite you and if you happen to find someone else who is excited about the same things as you, then you stay with them.. but what are the chances of that?

*This morning Chris told me that some guy had paddled out on that same day on the same beach   where we were and had lost his board.  He, however, did not make it out alive.  It took a long time for that to really hit me.  I have a lot of confidence in my abilities in the water, with or without a board but sometimes it's probably just stupid luck."

I have figured that, at the rate i'm finishing things out now, my horse project will most likely be finished by christmas.  I'm not going to the city about it.  That's advice I've been given in the past few weeks by people who have worked for/with the city and county for the past 30 years.  Don't tell anyone...

January I will open for business and start to smooth out all the kinks.  I figure by the beginning of February I will be ready to take off... where I'll go I don't know.  I have good friends with open couches in san francisco and new york that have already told me I am more than welcome.  I have a lot of different kinds of experiences under my belt so I think I could get into a wide range of things.  

It's exciting and terrifying at the same time.  I don't know whether to listen to my head or to my heart.  I always tell my students to go with their gut feeling.  That's their mathematical intuition pointing them in a direction.  It may not be the exact right direction but it's a start and even if it's wrong, it gets you moving and its easy to change directions.  When the time comes, i'm going with my gut and i'll just keep changing until i start to get it right."

I also wrote a song while i was there. sean helped me with some of the chords and i got this wave of inspiration and wrote all the words and now i have a song.  i've never done that before.  It's very simple but it was a huge step for me.

"event","my mother is a school bus driver.  She likes it a lot.  She used to love it but things change.  Anyways, she is very good at it.

The school year started yesterday and she had explained to me a few days ago that she was going to take on the short bus.  She would be driving around kids with various disabilities. She sounded excited about it.

So I called her today and she told me that there was a slight incident..

I guess one of the girls with down syndrome had got on the bus in a rather tart mood because of some disagreement with another special needs kid over some toy or something.  My mom told this girl that she had to stop physically harassing the other child.  So the girl slapped my mom across  her arm.  So my mom told her that she couldn't do that either..

this is when all hell breaks loose.  This special needs girl turns to my mom and lunges at her; scraping, biting, and going for the hair with, i can only imagine, fierce intent.  my mom reaches for the radio to call for help but before she could radio back to the base, her attacker rips the handset cord out of the radio unit-clever girl.

She manages to dial someone important on her cell phone but it gets knocked out of her hand.  She manages to turn it on speaker phone and finally gets someone to send someone else out.  

and this whole time, my mom is just blocking this girl's blows because I guess they passed some law a while back where you can't hit kids that aren't your own-especially bus drivers.  My mom, being the upstanding citizen that she is, doesn't lay a finger on this girl even though, at the end of the day she is left with bleeding scratches, contusions and bite marks from this enraged girl-about a dozen in all.  

including this nice one across the forehead.

a few millimeters deeper, she would need stitches.

She went to the doctor and got a tetnis shot. He said she was good to work though. so tomorrow she's got to do her route again; pick up the same girl too.  i guess they are giving her an ""aid"" to ride along in case of any more conflicts.  I guess aids are granted the right to knock the kids down or something-they probably need a special certificate as to make sure it's done in a humane way-i don't know i get confused with the politics."

"event","so today was my grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary.  There was a mass and then a party and it was all so nice.  it was great.  i got to see so many people from my past; people i remember from when i was a child.  and i talked to them and i just really felt so good about the whole thing.

i even got to do some dancing with my brothers and sisters. all of them.  my sister carie is out here from florida for the party <b>(oh, and sunday we are all-lolo included-will fly out to florida to stay there a week with my sister).</b>  so all 5 of us kids were dancing up a storm, all alone on the dance floor.  though, the dj was not that receptive to the mood of the crowd, he had some good songs every now and then.

i made a slide show for the party and played it with some music.  the whole thing was over too quickly-i should have left 6 or 7 seconds for each picture instead of just 4.  that was a bad call-but, people still liked it

at one point, my grandpa found this hideous black wig, put it on and danced around the floor-my grandma quickly followed suit, found her own ridiculous wig and everybody watched as they made complete fools of themselves.  it was wonderful.

then, i stood in the corner with my brothers, sisters and cousins and sucked helium out of balloons and made funny voices until we were light headed..

I talked to a good family friend about starting community gardens...and, i guess he has a friend who owns a company that, for charity purposes, finds buildings in impoverished neighborhoods, buys them, tears them down, fertilizes the soil underneath and starts community gardens.  This blew my mind.  These exact same ideas have been fermenting in my head these past couple years and i haven't known what to do with them because i didn't think anyone did that kind of thing.  So, I'm going to call him sometime soon.. maybe i'll end up in new jersey.  

and so the night ended with me, my grandpa, his brother jessie, his sisters dixie and marva, his brother in law gary, sitting around the front of the house, drinking cheap beer, telling stories.  i was so happy.

I think i have realized something about why my grandpa's side of the family is so incredible.  their main goal is to love and support the people they care about.  It doesn't matter what someone may believe or what they want to do, as long as it doesn't go against basic humanistic principles, they will support you.  sitting with them tonight, i got the feeling that i could start a conversation on any subject, take any side of an argument, and they would all sit there and agree, telling me how right i was... and it dawned on me-the subject matter of the opinion doesn't really matter to them-it is just that their hearts are so damn full of love and respect for you that no matter what you say (within reason) they will support you because they love you.  the very idea of that, when it hit me, just made me want to cry.


i understand that, to some people, that would be infuriating-that they don't have a set of beliefs or opinions that they stick to and won't shake, but something i've been realizing is that opinions, generally, aren't worth the time it takes to express them.. they are just words, it doesn't matter what you <i>say</i>, it's what you <i>do</i> that's important.  Ernie pointed this out the other day-with politics, strong opinions go nowhere unless they belong to people with sway, people with some say in what happens.  for politicians, their ideas become laws or whatnot-for the rest of us, ideologies are pointless unless they define how we live, how we interact with each other..

it is so refreshing from the negative, narcissistic, self loathing attitude i pick up from my uncle.  with him, most everything is bad, there is little reason to be happy and any opportunity to either bring someone down, or complain about how bad things are is snatched up with such haste, you would think it is a conscious effort.  where opinions rule and philosophy isn't really put into practice.

i stepped into the trailer to say goodnight to my 99 year old great grandmother who came all the way from new mexico for the festivities.  She can't talk too well on account of a surgery she had a few years back.  in spite of that, she still has no trouble expressing how she feels.  when she saw me her eyes lit up, she smiled this amazingly warm smile-one so completely genuine, it warmed me completely.  i told her goodnight. she told me that she loved me and, with all her strength, hugged me, looked back at me with the kindest eyes.  i knew how she felt.  i knew what she was saying to me.  she didn't have to utter a word.  it is so incredibly unconditional, i can't even explain it.  i don't think i have known someone so completely full, so at peace, you could see it in their eyes.  I have been spending as much time with her as I can these past couple of days.  it has been a good week.  it will be sad to see them go."

"event","today was so strange

I just got this very odd feeling about most everything.

I have been trying to fix up the barn in preparation for getting it going as a business.  The thing is, to be legitimate, I need this conditional use permit and that requires meetings with the city and all the neighbors and $500 and <i> inspections </i>...  I'm pretty nervous about the whole thing-I really want it to work.  If it works, I'm going to leave, swiftly.  You see, the thing is, I love my grandparents to death and my uncle, I've given them so much because I care for them... but I really think it's sucking me dry.  And the negativity, I take it so personally.  Sometimes I feel like just digging a hole and throwing myself in for a while.  It's just such a strange thing because I want to help out but I know that I need to start doing things for myself. Which I am, starting.  

So I'm thinking of moving to Seattle with Lia.  Just for a year. 

It was so hard for me to get any work done today.  I would start, then find a reason to stop, then stop and convince myself to start again.  

When I finally decided to come back home and rest for the night, I noticed something odd.  A group of about five kids that frequent the local bike jumps were grouped around the front door of my uncle's house.  I figured they were there asking for water or something, but as I got closer,  I could tell that there was slightly more intent in their actions.  I walked up to the front door, remaining silent.  I asked one of them what was going on.  He informed me that one of his friends had hurt himself going off one of the jumps.  As I got closer, I saw this boy, sitting on a small bench beside the front door.  His red shorts that hung down below his knees were completely ripped up to the crotch.  I saw blood on his thigh.  he was shaking and crying.  his friend was using his cell phone to try and get this kid's grandma on the phone.  I walked up to the kid and asked what was wrong.  He looked up at me and through a mass of tears and involuntary shaking, he told me what had happened.  He moved his had away from his crotch to show me.  He had a cut that was about an inch and a half from the base of his penis down his scrotum.  I could see his testicle.  There was blood all over the place.

Chris was inside on the phone calling 911.  Lolo was talking to the kid, reassuring him that he was not going to die.  I went inside and got a washcloth, got it wet and brought it to the boy.  He was scared.  Apparently, he wasn't even supposed to be at the jumps. his grandma didn't know where he was, he had lied to her.  By this time, his friends were at a distance.  He kept saying how it hurt real bad how he didn't want to die.  I kept asking him stupid questions about where he went to school and what kind of things he liked-to try and help keep his mind off of what was happening.  When he wasn't focusing on the questions, he was shaking and losing control of his breathing.

The ambulance finally got there.  Three people got out.  one was a girl.  he told me that he didn't like girls.  He was ten years old, about to go into sixth grade, taking summer classes in math and english.  His parents were ""gone"" and he lived with his grandmother.  

The fire department got there and, though I could tell they were trying to be professional, I could tell it was taking them a bit of restraint to keep from laughing.  His grandmother also showed up.  She had followed the fire truck, thinking it might be finding her grandson.  She just seemed angry because he had disobeyed.  She kept giving him angry looks and he had said how she was going to be so mad.  I kept thinking ""big fucking deal, so he broke the rules, at least he is okay. something has happened, this boy is one the verge of going into shock from the pain, and all this lady can think about is how she is going to punish him later on. Sometimes kids just need you to hold them and tell them things are going to be okay and that one day you will look back on this and laugh.  That things aren't always so serious and there are no absolutes and what is important is that he was going to get better and lead a normal life while hopefully learning some lesson from this--I mean, how could he not?!?  what more of a lesson could be learned?""  man I wanted to punch her.

but I didn't.  they all left.  things just fizzled away.  The cop cars were the last to go.  Things settled and the three of us (Lolo, Chris and I) were left on the porch, wondering what the hell had just happened. Everything went back to normal in a couple of minutes and it left us questioning if anything had happened at all.  I think we all agreed it was a weird day.  We decided to do something very rare for all of us.  We all sat together and watched a movie.  ""sweet and lowdown.""  It was good.  The strangeness of the movie went along well with the strangeness of the day and as the movie ended, the thought of going down to the dump to shoot some rats, or going out for a late night round of train watching, didn't seem like such an odd idea.  

I just hope to god that tomorrow is, at least, slightly more normal.  I couldn't handle very much of that."

So as I prepare for my final finals, I am confronted with the question ""what is the most creative way to put of studying until the last minute?""  Well, I went surfing this morning.  That's a start.

I spent the night last night with my cousins in Hermosa and we woke up early this morning to go surfing.  When we got to the beach, there were two guys by the beach, huddled around something small and alive.  At first I thought it was a puppy, but I was mistaken, it was a pup.  A seal pup that had apparently been separated from its mother.  They were petting it.  It was so strange to see something like that and it wasn't until I was out in the water that I thought how bad of an idea it was for these guys to be so close to this wild animal.  The two guys eventually left and the seal was all alone.  People would walk by, do a double take and then go in for a closer look.  I decided to go in and sit around the area to make sure nobody messed with it.  

I sat down with my board a good distance away from the little pup.  His eyes were almost shut and it looked like they had been watering.  It looked like he was pouting slightly.  Every minute or so he would stretch out and reach back to his backside and scratch his back with his teeth.  He wasn't moving around a whole lot.

A few people came up and shoved cameras in its face.  One guy, who was smoking, got real close with his camera phone and tried to make a stupid joke about how he was holding the cigarette for the seal.  Some people just don't get it.

Somebody had called animal control and a lifeguard drove up and separated everybody from the animal.  By that time my cousin Caleb had come out of the water and was standing with me.  The crowd dispersed and Caleb and I went up to the lifeguard.  We thought we should tell the lifeguard about the guys touching them earlier.  I also wanted to tell him about the other seal I had seen earlier swimming out by the surfers, maybe it was looking for this guy. 

He told us this little pup was sick.  He said there was something in the water that had been infecting the local sea life.  This bacterium gets into their brains and they slowly lose the ability to function properly.  He says that it's stupid for people to get close to these animals because if they aren't willing to run away, they are probably sick and will probably get you sick.. Also, he said their jaws are like five times stronger than a rottweiler.  That cute little pup could rip a guys hand off no problem.  As long as he didn't get back into the water, they could take him to a hospital and maybe save him.  

We started back in the water and left the lifeguard to wait for the animal hospital people.  As we were walking back into the water, the little pup followed us.  I don't know why, he didn't follow any of the other surfers in and he hadn't followed us in before.  We didn't realize until it was too late.  I looked back to see the lifeguard driving away.  About ten minutes later I saw a white truck on the beach there with a cage in the back, obviously looking for the little guy.  

I don't really know how to feel about it though.  Maybe he wasn't sick and just lost.  I know that when little pups are lost from their parents in the sea, they are taught not to move at all.  It makes it more likely that the parents will find them.  Stay in one place.  Maybe the lifeguard was right and this little guy is going to die soon.  

Well, I guess it's hard to say but about half an hour later I did notice something in the water about 20 yards from me.  It looked like a seal, a big one, swimming out to sea.  I don't think the mother would have given up looking so soon.  Maybe it was wishful thinking but I think it was them and that they had found each other.  Anyways, I can't stop thinking about it.

I should study some more."

"event","hello again, friends.  It has been a long time since I've written anything of substance.  I'm not quite sure why, I guess it just happens that way.  But I think I'd like to write some more.  It's not good to keep feelings bottled up inside.  It's good to express feelings.  It's good to write down stories and remember things in a way that makes you think about them differently and see them from a new perspective.  I don't promise any of the things I write will be any good but I will write them all the same. 

so..

Today Lia and I went to a ""Self Realization Fellowship"" in Fullerton.  I haven't attended any kind of service, of my own free will, for a long time.  Lia suggested it would be interesting.  It was.   

The church sits on the corner of a mildly busy street in an old white building that was probably home to a church of Christian denomination in the recent past.  Small, quaint, appealing to the eye.  A church in the least intrusive kind of way.  It stood in stark contrast to the heavy, stone, gothic scientologist building down the street.  There were red flowers and green grass around the front of the building, leading up to the stairs that led to the main entrance. As we walked in we were greeted with sounds of light organ music in the background, soothing to be sure.  To our right there was a table with a collection of a few dozen different pamphlets on the workings of the church and its' beliefs.  We walked into the main room.  It was a small auditorium with a high ceiling.  The brown, retro-looking, chairs were bolted to the carpet-a sea of carpet, deep blue that seemed as though it was going to, at any moment, give way and consume us both.  Light was cascading through the windows.  The windows were all of an etched design and it was not possible to see through them.  The alter was simple and had only a few pictures of religious leaders throughout the ages.  the only one I recognized was Jesus-he looked the most distressed.  

Meditation was from 10:00-10:45.  I tried to settle myself and relax a bit before we began.  I have been feeling very anxious for the past few weeks.  It's hard to explain but it feels like there is this deep pressure on my lower chest, in the center, where the two halves come together.  Maybe it's because I'm having a hard time in school.  Maybe it's because I'm anticipating things changing for me come the end of this month.  Maybe it's because I don't know what I am going to do next but I know it needs to be somewhere away from here.  It's probably some complicated combination of them all.  

I was looking down, trying to focus on breathing.  Over the speakers came the soft voice of a man telling us that it was time for meditation.  He was wearing an orange cloak that covered his black cloths.  He had light complexion and brown hair that was turning white.  He began to play an instrument in front of him.  It was an organ that he pumped with is left hand and played with  his right.  He sang, chanted and played.  We all relaxed.  He gave us instructions to help us focus.  He explained that we needed to ask questions and then open ourselves and allow for the answers to come in-to forget the insignificant thoughts that bind us to this world.  So I tried.  

It was silent for 45 minutes. 

It is hard to think of nothing-or to think of just one thing, with your eyes closed.  I would last about 30 seconds and then some thought would come flying in from far away and knock me out of it.  They weren't particularly important thoughts but one led to another and the first thing I knew I was thinking about how Sean and I got hired by this lady to mow her lawn when we were like 13 but we only did it once and then avoided her house for the next 5 years.  

I was only able to concentrate for about 10 straight minutes.  I kept feeling this light on my face and then these arrows flying across the inside of my eyelids from left to right-they were more like blobs that had the general shape of arrows.  Then my butt started to fall asleep and it was entirely impossible to concentrate so I gave up and started to think of more random things.

After the meditation there was some down time as people filtered in for the ""lesson""  at 11.  It seemed to be a very diverse crowd.  All kinds of people, all ages, would come in and say a prayer, then sit down.  We only stayed for a little bit of the lesson.  The chanting and songs seemed to possess a certain disdain for being in human form and it was a bit hard to swallow. 

All for the better.  We walked into downtown and found some kind of train festival down and the Fullerton train station.  It's really great.  Lia and I have this tendency to stumble across all kinds of little exciting things like that.  We see them in much the same way.  It's good to have a partner in crime-one that helps you see beauty in things.  It will be very hard to see her go come June.

I'm going outside.  It's a beautiful day and Chris just invited me over for some pizza.  Writing is good."

well, it turns out that we totally won the big, main, massive prize at the end when the judges finish their judging...

We just got back from the awards ceremony-it was insane...

there were something like 90 teams and a total of 500 people taking part..

there were 6 categories to be judged-we were nominated (top 4) for 5 of the six categories.  We won best acting and best film.  

...then we celebrated at jack in the box with a round of ""victory"" poppers and orange juice in a carton.  This has truly been an incredible day.

...but don't take my word for it, go watch it yourself:
<A href=""http://madfilmdash.computerstore.uci.edu/films/list"">to the mad film dash website...</A>


-our team name is ""Targets"" and the genre is ""silent film""

"event","i've been seeing a lot of doctors lately.  Just small stuff really, this and that.  I went in last week to see a doctor about some moles on my skin that were kinda funny looking.  I asked him if I could see a dermatologist to get all checked out.  He said that I didn't need to see a dermatologist-that he could do any of that skin work himself.  So last week he took out some moles on my upper chest.  I went in today to get the stitches taken out and asked him again if I could see a dermatologist.  He started in again on his thing about dermatologists...

""Any general practitioner that can't tell the difference between a malignant skin spot and a benign skin spot isn't a very good doctor at all.""

""So then you thought the moles on my shoulder were cancerous?"" 
(it turns out that they were normal and not cancerous at all)

""...well, what did I tell you before I took them out-did I say that they were probably nothing or that they were dangerous?""

""you told me that you were concerned about them.""

""So what was your question?""

""I mean, you wanted them out, couldn't you tell the difference between benign and malignant?""
(he then checks out some other moles, including one on my back that I hadn't known about the last time I was in)

""Well, to tell you the truth, I am concerned about those other spots I see too.  I'm going to want a second opinion on those-don't want to go cutting a bunch of holes in you-so I'll have you go to see a dermatologist.""

"event","I find myself here again, behind the same walls-doing the same things.  Only this time it's different.

This past summer was so amazing on so many levels.  I find myself, throughout the day, stopping and placing myself in some familiar foreign land in my head to try and feel good.  The thing that I love is that I can remember the places I've been.  I can remember them so well that I'll close my eyes, place myself in the alps and then progress through a hike-I'll smell the smells, feel the musty earth and things will come to me in my daydream that I had forgotten-like it was happening all over again.  I do the same with lots of places-in Brighton, Wales-dancing with Lia to stupid songs from the 70s at an Italian wedding with the best Spumante I've ever consumed, next to cross dressers and newlyweds whose favorite possessions were in the process of being raffled off.  So I do this often.  It's like the book <u>The Giver</u>.  

So...my brother Chris is living with me now-more like he and is girlfriend are living here now.  I want to hang out with him and watch movies or take a walk or play some music..but that doesn't happen.  His lady comes over and they hang out in his room and do very quiet things.  I know my uncle doesn't like it.  He says ""that's enough of that bull shit,"" but he won't do anything cause he doesn't want to offend anyone.  He's a good guy.

Ernie is also staying with me...but the other day my grandma told him and his girlfriend, with little class, that she could not stay.  They were so much fun to hang out with-the first night they stayed over, they made me kiesh from scratch and talked and laughed.  Then there is all this crap going on.  So Chris isn't around long enough to spend time with and Ernie and Ann don't feel comfortable enough to be here...so I don't have anyone to hang out with except Lolo-who is sad all the time and my physics books who hate me.  So I tend to get stressed out lately.  My grandma and Lolo want to know what is ""wrong"" with me-why I don't smile any more-like I did right when I got back from the trip.  Well, I think that I got a taste of a kind of freedom...and now I realize its' absence.  I talked to my grandma the other night.  I told here I want to help out but I also want to have at least part of my life that is for me-maybe even a little corner of somewhere that I can go and put my stuff and sit quietly-but some place that I feel like I don't have to follow anybody else's rules-it's like living at home in High School-but worse because this isn't high school and I'm 23 now-and I'm not here because I couldn't make it in the world on my own...I'm here because I want to help out-to give a little support and maybe brighten up an otherwise dark and dreary day...and the reward...to be treated as an adolescent...  But the thing is that I feel selfish for wanting these things-like it is putting other people out-but I think maybe I don't want to be so passive anymore because it gets easy to feel really small and really under-foot.. and at the very least, I can't do a very good job taking care of someone if I am unhappy-I learned that the hard way.  Without support I crumbled-and it was really bad.  I was just lucky to have someone there to pick me up and help me out.  I'm very grateful for that."

-walked in the parade
-had some people ask to take my picture
-talked with the biggest figure in gay rights activism (without even knowing who he was).  He was nice-we talked about the pope and education and stuff.
-saw Sir Ian mckellen (gandalf) on stage talking about being ""georgeous"" then bumped into him later on by a burger stand.
-hung out with some lesbians
-hung out with some cracked up lesbians who were in the process of getting more cracked up.
-went to my first lesbian bar
-shared in England's bitter football defeat
-went to my second lesbian bar and danced with the lesbians

I did, however, go on a horse ride with Lia who came home recently after she got a really bad case of mono.  She's doing better now and left about an hour ago with her father to Bakersfield.  She doesn't know what she is going to do now.  There was talk of her spending a year in Japan or Dublin.  

I'm not sure if making the decision to go on this trip was such a good one.  I'm extremely excited that I get to go but I'm worried about things around here.  Lolo had some kind of ""quasi"" heart attack the other day and spent two days in the hospital.  I don't know if Chris is ready for this much.  There is a lot of work to be done.  Half of the orange grove is going to be torn out in a month to make way for blackberries and the horse ladies are soooooooooo demanding.  I hope it works.  I think I have made the decision that if anything does happen I'll fly home early.  

We'll see.  I'm nervous.  Had trouble sleeping last night and had a nightmare.  I kind of had a shock today when I realized how close this all is.  I was explaining to lolo about my trip and he said, ""So basically you know where you are going to sleep tonight but don't know where you are going to sleep tomorrow night.""

"event","The mountains were amazing.  I haven't been backpacking in something like three or four years.  I went on a hike with Danny and he kept holding my hand and helping me up steps, being very gentle.  He is great.

I took a lot of naps.  The vicodin is very strange.  I was beginning to enjoy the mellow mood I would slide into after taking one, but I'm getting sick of it real quickly.  I got sick the other night after taking one on the way to Murrieta.  I think it was a combination of the drugs, the heat and my grandpa being a racecar driver.  Plus, they make it increasingly difficult to concentrate on anything.  I'm wondering how that is going to work out with school.  But I don't worry too much about it because all I can think about is leaving for England.  

OK, and I guess my sister Ashley was taking some pictures of our cousin Rachel by the cabin and an elderly gentleman, who was camping at an adjacent camp site, came over to give her some pointers.  He ended up giving her this $1200 Nikon camera so she could advance her already present ""gift"" for photography.  STRANGE.  At first I was kinda pissed because she is so materialistic to begin with and I don't know if she will actually appreciate the gift... but the anger, which was probably partially due to jealousy, turned to something else like excitement or something.  It would be really cool if she got good at something, other than cheer.  Not that there is anything bad with cheer, just that if she was consumed by just cheer, I could see things getting difficult for her when high school ended---and she is my sister and I am probably harder on her.

Anyways, I'm getting the munchies and things seem to be glowing in a strange kind of way.  I hope I'll be able to stop taking these things before too long."

"event","There is this room in the surgical center that you go to before you go in for the actual surgery.  It is a big room with curtains hanging from the ceiling that can be draped around each bed for privacy.  I walk into the room and the nurse starts asking me questions.

After a few minutes of that, I walk over to a bed and am instructed to remove everything except for my socks and then put on one of those hospital gowns.  I pull the curtain around the bed, slip into the hospital gown and sit, awkwardly, on the side of the bed trying to finish a few lines of the book I have been reading.  

The nurse walks up to the edge of the curtain.  I can see her shoes from where I am propped on the side of the bed.  

""You decent?"" she asks.
""I'm as decent as I'm gonna get,"" I answer.

She walks in with a blanket and tells me to lay down.  I put on the supplied hair net.  Then she puts the blanket over me and closes the curtain.  She asks which side the hernia is on.  I tell her it's on the left.  Then she lifts my gown just above my belly button and with what looks like a child's purple marker writes in large block letters ""YES"" on my left side.

The nurse was very nice and told me about her hernia operation a few years back, gave me some advice for a good recovery and took some vitals.  Then she put me on an IV and those little sticky things on my chest that they hook wires up to so they can be sure you are still alive.      

Then she left to go get my mother and grandmother who were waiting patiently in the waiting room.  When they get there, I can tell that they are nervous.  My grandma, I think, is always nervous, but I could tell that she was just slightly more so right now.  They had nervous smiles on their faces and were trying to make jokes and talk about happy things.  I went along with it and tried to laugh a little.  I was getting a little scared.  Everyone seemed to know what they were doing but the reality of the situation, I think, had hit me when the nurse stuck that IV in the side of my arm.

I was slightly bummed that I wouldn't have any documentation of this momentous occasion...until I remembered that my phone has a camera on it...and a camera that takes pretty decent photos.  So I break it out and take some pictures.

Then I saw the best part of the whole surgical center.  My bed was facing the path that the nurses used to wheel out the patients to the operating room.  I had noticed a string hanging out of the ceiling with a handle on the end of it.  One of the nurses took the elderly woman who was in the bed next to me and wheeled her bed around and stopped right underneath the string.  She waited there for a few moments like an airplane that just aligned with the runway and is waiting for final clearance to takeoff.  Then she pulls the string, the doors ahead of her fly open and they go sailing out into another hall that would take them to an operating room.  It was so cool!!!! 

(you can see the string hanging from the ceiling just to the left of my mom's head in the picture of her pointing her phone at me)

Then it was my turn.  I kissed my mother and grandmother goodbye, we wheel around and wait under the string.  I felt like a race horse waiting at the gate for the bell to ring and the crowd to start cheering.  She pulled the string and we were off.

We wheeled into the operating room.  The doctor, a very happy old man, was humming a tune to himself that I couldn't make out but it seemed to put a smile on his face.  I transferred beds and chatted with the anesthesiologist about the classical music that was playing.

""they gonna play that the whole time the surgery is going on?"" I query.
""If I can help it, it'll be off in about five minutes.  Why, you like classical music?""
""I can usually enjoy music if there is something I can respect about it.""

I finish getting hooked up to all the gadgets and whatnot.  The room is very cold.  There are four people in the room and the anesthesiologist makes a joke about one of the nurses turning it down to 42 degrees.  I didn't think it was that funny but they all laughed.  Maybe it was an inside joke.  Maybe they were testing to see if the drugs were taking affect.  I feel something cold rush out of the IV and into my bloodstream. 

""Hey, I felt that.""
""That?"" replies the anesthesiologist, ""That was nothing.""
""So, how much of this am I going to remember?"" I ask.
""About ten more seconds.""
""I can already feel it in my face, weird!""

I could feel this stuff taking over and my body becoming numb.  Then I pass out.

When I woke up, I remember another nurse there, in the recovery.  I ask her how long I had been there.  She said they finished the surgery about twenty five minutes before I came to.  I was very aware that I was still drugged up and that it would take me a while to get out of it, even if I felt ok.  So I made a special effort to be extra nice. 

The doctor came to my bedside.  For some reason I was extremely happy to see him.  I shook his hand and thanked him.

""Thanks so much doctor, I feel great.""
""Yeah, the whole thing went real smoothly.""
""Doc, I really felt like we connected there for a few minutes.  It was great, I feel really happy about the whole thing.""
""Ok, steve, that's great, I'll see you in a week.""

I felt really good at this point.  In about five minutes I realized that it was the drugs making me feel good and a closer inspection of the hernia area showed that the whole area was numb.  

I looked over at the guy across the way.

""What are you in for?""
""hernia.""
""Me too.""
""umbilical hernia?"" he asked.
""No, lingual.""
""oh.""
""..."" 

At which point I got my cranberry juice and sucked it down cheerfully.  I was feeling so good, I got another one.  Then I got dressed and walked to the car. 

I feel good now.  It hurts a little bit and I still can't feel when I touch the area and walking is kinda slow going.  But I walked around the grove a little bit and even talked to the horse ladies...and I helped Lolo with something.  6 weeks (3 fortnights)for a full recovery.  I'll be in England by then.  I'll be back from the mountains Monday afternoon."

"event","This was almost too much. Roy was about to lose his battle with not messing his pants and lose it badly. He moaned and uttered an uninteligable noise that could've been anything as she rode him.

This would've been so much better without clothing, but Roy didn't care.

<i>Fuck yes</i>, his mind supplied, but the words never made it past his lips. Instead all he said was a whispered, ""close."""

"event","The child Osfameron had confirmed it. The Fullmetal <i>was</i> here. Even if this whole situation wasn't his fault, Roy slept a little easier knowing that he had something logical to fall back on.

He sat on a large rock about half an hour away from the building they called the Compound just for some fresh air. The people were nice enough, but Roy didn't want ""nice"". He wanted his subordinates. He wanted his best friend. He wanted a world that made <i>sense</i>. This wasn't it.

Moreover, he wanted his flame. He snapped his fingers. The fabric still created a spark, of course, but it didn't catch anything. It was like it was taunting him. But if he couldn't use Alchemy, it likely meant that the Fullmetal couldn't either. At least he hoped not. The last thing he wanted was that kid showing off.

His uniform jacket lay next to him while he stretched out and looked out at the rising sun. It had been ages since he'd stayed up until dawn. He smiled ruefully as his memory took him back to an easier time. Before the Ishbal War, back when he and Hughes were just Roy and Maes. A slight smile spread over his face. ""I wish you were here,"" he said softly to the dawn, hoping against hope that somewhere Hughes could still hear him."

"event","Roy had waited for <i>years</i> for this. He couldn't say why anything involving those Brothers struck him so deeply. Maybe it was because they reminded him of himself and Maes at a very young age? Maybe it was because he knew that they were capable of so much more than he ever would be? Or maybe it was simply something he wasn't going to ever admit to? It was probably that come to think of it.

He had to let Al go though, had to let the boy at least try to stay with the Fullmetal. There was a great golden glow and then silence. They were gone. The both of them gone forever and now Roy had a duty to do. Sure he was tempted to follow through, who wouldn't be? There might yet be a Hughes on the other side. But in the end, Duty won over Temptation. He extended his hand in front of him, snapped and the entire place was enveloped in flame. It was a great explosion, really, Kimblee would've probably wet himself.

But Roy didn't care. What did he have left to him now? He had been stripped of his rank and honours. Even though his sub-ordinates still treated him like the Colonel he had once been, it wasn't the same. He had done what he set out to do though. He had ensured in his own way that those two brothers were reunited and now his job was done. He walked through the empty streets, numb to the world around him. His body was in the present, but his mind and heart were years in the past. Someone might have been calling his name...he wasn't certain."

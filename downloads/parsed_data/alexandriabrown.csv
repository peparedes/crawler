"event","So.  Yeah.  I'm totally going to stop whining about writing and actually freaking write.  It's this nutty concept I have.  In the meantime, I'm actually going to post the rest of what I have done on this because sheesh I suck.

<lj-cut text=""His life was not an action movie.  No matter how much the universe kept trying to make it one."">

Once, just once, Jim thought as he ran down the alley, it would be nice if it wasn't cold, dark and pouring down rain while he chased a criminal of some stripe down a dark alley.  There was no need for his life to look like some action movie.  During the day would be fine. Night would be acceptable as long as it was spring.  Hell, even a cold, dark night would be fine if it simply stopped pouring down rain.  He ducked around the corner, trying to keep up with the man running full tilt towards the fence.  Maybe he'd get lucky for once and the suspect wouldn't try to make an escape in the most ridiculous fashion possible.  

""Freeze!  Gotham PD!""  Jim pulled out his gun, blinking to clear the rain from his eyes.  ""Stop right there, you're under arrest!""

Sure enough the man yelled something, Jim couldn't make out what, then made a leap for the fence.  Jim holstered his gun, then jogged down the alley, watching as the man got stuck half way up.  It was faintly ridiculous, seeing him hanging there.  Jim looked up at him, waiting for the man to stop swearing.  ""Are you ready to give up or do you want me to leave you hanging there for awhile?""  Jim jumped back, dodging as the man spit at him.  ""Fine, hanging there it is.""  He stepped back, tacking off his glasses and brushing hair out of his eyes.  He heard Stephens' yell of ""Jim!"" from down the alley and he called back ""Down here, we're gonna need a ladder!""

Stephens came trotting down the alley, a look of disbelief on his face as he saw the suspect clutching to the fence.  ""Are you fucking kidding me?  How did he even get that high in the first place?""

""Hell if I know.""  Jim tipped his head to the side.  ""I'm glad he dropped his gun, at least he's not taking potshots at us.""  

""Thank God for small favors.""  Stephens grabbed his radio and called for more backup, not bothering to disguise the amusement in his voice as he explained exactly why it was that they needed a ladder.

Jim wandered back over to where their suspect was still spitting and cursing and threatening to call unholy vengeance down upon them.  ""You're really not in the position to make threats right now, you know.""  He shook his head sadly.  ""I really don't get why you thought you could make it over the fence.""

The man yelled something down, the only intelligible words were fuck and mother and dog.  Jim snorted and turned, trying to pinpoint exactly where the gun ended up.  He heard a sudden yell and he turned fast.  There was a fleeting impression of a dark mass falling and then something hit him and he slammed into the ground, his head smacking the pavement before everything went dark.

There was an incessant beeping and Jim tried to move his arm to smack the alarm.  Nothing happened and he tried again.  Still nothing.  He opened his eyes slowly, slowly realizing that he wasn't in his bedroom.  There was a blue glow from monitors and the beeping seemed to be by his head and it was cold and the walls were white.  There was a moment of pure panic until his thoughts slowly gelled and he realized he was in the hospital.  He left out a low moan.  God, his head hurt and his back hurt and it felt like even his eyes hurt.

""Jim?  Jim, can you hear me?""  That was Phil's voice and Jim tried to turn his head to see him.  It was far more difficult than it should be.

""What, what happened?""  Jim tried to swallow, his throat was so dry it ached.

""You're in the hospital.""  Phil turned, filling a glass with water.  He reached an arm behind Jim's shoulder, holding him up enough that Jim could take a sip of water.  

Jim sipped the water gratefully, struggling not to take a huge swallow.  No matter how desperately he wanted that drink, he knew it was better to go slow.  ""I figured that out, but what happened?""

Phil settled on the edge of the bed, a hand running down Jim's arm.  He looked awful, Jim saw.  He was unshaven and it looked like he hadn't slept and his face was thinner than usual.  ""You've been unconscious for almost four days.  I wasn't sure,"" he looked away and his fingers dug into Jim's shoulder for a moment.  ""I wasn't sure you were going to wake up.""

Jim stared at him, unable to comprehend what he was hearing.  ""What?  Unconscious?  What the hell?""  He tried to think back, tried to focus on the last thing he remembered.  He could see the man on the fence, he remembered something about a gun and then nothing.  

""The guy you chased up the fence fell off.  He fell right on top of you.  From what we could tell, you hit the back of your head first and that caused a subdural hematoma.  Luckily, the swelling started to go down last night or you were going to need surgery.""  Phil skimmed his fingertips down Jim's cheek.  ""Thank God they brought you in fast.  It could have been much worse.""

Jim turned into the touch, trying to make sense of what he was hearing.  ""He fell on me?""

""He fell on you.""  Phil leaned down, kissing Jim lightly.  ""It would be funny if the bastard didn't almost kill you.""  

""God.""  Jim reached over, tangling his fingers with Phil's.  ""Am I, will there be permanent damage?""  He felt a wave of terror wash over him.  ""Please, you have to tell me.""

""I don't think so, the CT scans look pretty good.  You're going to have hellish headaches for awhile and there may be some vision and balance issues at first but it looks good that you'll fully recover.""  Phil squeezed his hand.  ""You scared the shit out of me, cop.""

""Sorry about that, doc.""  Jim tugged at his hand, trying to pull him closer.  ""Have you slept at all?""

""Not as such.""  Phil shifted on the bed, trying to get closer.  ""I wanted to be here when you woke up.""

""Come here then."" Jim shifted over as much as he could.  ""Lie down with me.""

""I'm not sure that's a good idea.""  Phil settled down next to him, an arm draped over his chest.

""I think it is.""  Jim nestled into Phil, the warmth of his body soothing.  ""I cannot believe he fell on me.""  There was a faint snort against his neck and Jim smiled a little.  ""Please tell me there's no video of it.""

""There's no video of it.  Once I'm sure you're going to be fine it'll be funny as hell.""  Phil kissed the side of his neck.  ""Don't take it personally if I pass out on you, okay?""

""No problem.""  Jim rested his arm over Phil's.  ""You sleep, okay, I'm not going anywhere.""

""Better not."" Phil breathed into his ear.  He listened as Phil's breathing slowly evened out, feeling the tightness in his chest ease.  His head still ached and he could tell that it was going to get worse later.  But for now it was enough to be there with his lover next to him.  He'd worry about the rest later.

""I cannot believe you're doing this.""  Phil crossed his arms, scowling at Jim.  ""I thought we agreed that you were going to take the time to evaluate other options.""

""No, you demanded that I quit and I told you to go to hell.""  Jim rubbed at his temple, feeling the throbbing start.  ""I'm sick of fighting about this.""

""And I'm sick of worrying that every morning when you leave it'll be the last time you do!""  Phil shook his head.  ""This is ridiculous, you're still supposed to be out on leave.""

""I've been out for two months and I'm perfectly capable of sitting at my desk and reviewing reports.""   Jim tried to keep his voice steady.  There was no point in yelling, all that would accomplish was winding up them both.  ""I'm not going out on calls, you know I'm not and I'm not going to be driving and I'll be good about not staring at the monitor for too long.  Phil, I'm going nuts sitting here at home, there's no reason why I can't go in.""  Jim turned back to the mirror, scowling as he finished doing up the knot on his tie.  ""The department's been great about giving me time and I don't want to push it.""

""Right, they've been great about calling you constantly and demanding to know when you're going to be back.  Here, let me do that.""  Phil turned Jim around, undoing the knot and then tying it quickly.  ""Believe it or not, Jim Gordon, you are not indispensible.""

""I never said that I was.""  He turned back to the mirror, eyeing the neat knot.  ""Thanks.""

""No problem.""  Phil leaned against the wall, looking at Jim tiredly.  ""Look, is it so awful that I don't want you doing something where you could get killed any second?""

""No, it's not.""  Jim pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to work on the breathing techniques for stress reduction that Thomas suggested.  It didn't seem to be working at the moment.  ""But how many times are we going to argue about this?  I'm a cop the way you're a surgeon, it's not what we do it's who we are.""  He glanced at the clock, then frowned.  ""I've got to get going, I'm going to miss the bus.""  He grabbed his briefcase then started out the door of his bedroom.  He stopped when Phil grabbed his arm.  

""You aren't even cleared to drive yet, Jim, don't you think that's a sign that you're pushing it a bit too fast?  Look, you see Shannon in two weeks, if she says it's fine to go back, then I'll drop it, okay?""  Phil gave him the sad eyes and Jim sighed.  

""I saw her last week and she said it was fine to go back to desk work now if I want as you well know.  Or where you not listening when we were there?""  Jim pulled away, trying to ignore the flash of anger on Phil's face.  ""I promise, I'll leave if it gets to be too much and I'll eat and I won't drink coffee and all of that stuff.  I need to do this, Phil, I can't stand sitting around.""

""Fine!""  Phil tossed up his hands.  ""Forgive me for giving a shit if you live or die.""

""You know what, I'm done with this fight.""  Jim turned, heading for the door.  ""You knew what I did when we started this.  You know damn well how important this is to me.""  He looked over his shoulder, fighting to keep his voice even.  ""Don't make me choose.  You won't like my choice.""  He stepped out, leaning against the wall for a minute before heading down the stairs.  That was exactly how he wanted to start the day.  He hurried down the street, hoping that he hadn't missed the bus.  God, he couldn't wait until he could drive again.  He didn't know how people did this every day.

Jim stifled a yawn as he came through the door.  He hated to admit it but he was exhausted.  Apparently doing paperwork all day took more energy than he'd ever thought.  It was probably the boredom of it, sure, he'd done it before but there was always something to break the monotony.  There were witnesses to interview or leads to follow or people to chase.  Sitting there and going through all the forms was wearying.  The only bright spot was the thought that he might, for once, get caught up.

""Hey.""  Jim nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard a voice behind him.  He barely kept from drawing his gun, his heart pounding hard.

""Shit, you scared the hell out of me.""  Jim dropped his briefcase to the floor, then hung up his coat.  ""I didn't think you'd be here.""  He tried to keep from sounding accusatory but he knew he didn't entirely succeed.  He turned around, trying to keep a neutral expression on his face.  ""So, what's up?""

""I wanted to apologize.""  Phil took a step towards him, then reached out, running a hand down Jim's arm.  ""I shouldn't have been such an asshole.""

""No, you shouldn't.""  Jim leaned into him, looping his arms around Phil's waist.  ""I'm tired of fighting about this.""

""Me too.""  Phil ran a hand down his back and Jim felt the tension begin to drain out with every slide of Phil's hand.  ""I'll figure out some way to deal with it, I promise.""

""Are you sure?""  Jim leaned back enough to look at him, eyes searching Phil's face.  ""If you can't, then you can't.  I won't blame you for that, it's a lot to ask.""

""Hey, it's not like I don't ask stuff from you.  There aren't many people who would understand how much I get called away.""  Phil kissed his temple.  ""You were right, it's who we are and not what we do.  Since I happen to be pretty damn fond of who you are, I'll find a way to deal.""

""Okay.""  Jim stifled a yawn.  ""If I tell you I'm completely exhausted, will you not say I told you so?""

Phil laughed.  ""Not a chance.  C'mon, cop, let's get some food in you and then I'll tuck you in.  If you're really good, I may even read you a bedtime story.""  Phil tugged him into the kitchen and Jim followed willingly.  

""What you do with Mother Goose is very disturbing, have I ever mentioned that?""  Jim kissed the back of Phil's neck.  ""Stay tonight.""

""I can do that.""  Phil smiled over his shoulder at Jim.  ""It might be disturbing but I've never heard any complaints.""

""Fine, fine, whatever, feed me, Seymour.""  Jim smirked at Phil's groan. ""You deserved that.""  

""I never should have let you see that. Now shut up and let me get my housewife on.""  Phil pushed Jim away.  ""Go change, I'll have dinner ordered by then.""

""You're so domestic it hurts.""  Jim padded for the bedroom, shedding his tie and jacket along the way.  ""Get extra dumplings, you always steal mine.""

""I do not!""  Jim grinned at the outraged tone to Phil's voice.  ""And that's only because you don't share.""  

""Fine, whatever, just get extra, I'm starved.""  Jim leaned out the bedroom door.  ""You think we have time for a shower before it gets here?"" 

""Oh hell yes.""  Phil shooed him back into the bedroom.  ""You get the water heated up, I'll call and then we'll get all cleaned up.""

""You've got it.""  Jim yawned, then padded into the bathroom, turning on the shower.  He really should move, the plumbing was terrible.  He heard Phil put in the order and then the sound of footsteps coming into the bathroom.  He checked the water, stepping in and tipping his head back.  All in all, it wasn't a bad day.

<lj-cut text=""Nut up or shut up."">

""Hello?""  Jim rubbed at his eyes, stifling a yawn. He spared a stray hope that it wasn't the station calling, he deserved this weekend off, he really did.

""Jim?""  Bruce's voice was shaky and Jim felt a jolt of fear go through him.

""Bruce, what's wrong?""  He grabbed for his keys, trying to remember where he kicked off his shoes.  ""Are you okay?""

""I'm, I'm,"" Jim heard Bruce swallow.  ""I'm down at Chelsea's.  Can you, can you come down here?  Please?""  Bruce's voice cracked a bit on the please and Jim nearly pitched into the wall pulling on his shoes.

""I'm on my way, you stay there, I'll be there in twenty minutes.  Fifteen.  Are you safe?  Do you need me to call your parents?""  Jim yanked his door shut, taking the stairs down two at a time.

""No!  God, please, no, don't call them, please, Jim.  I'll stay here and I'm fine, I, I, just please, please I need to talk to you.""  Jim could hear Bruce fighting to keep his voice under control.  ""I'll be waiting, see you in a few.""

""Wait, no, Bruce don't hang up.""  Jim swore as he realized Bruce wasn't on the line.  He turned the key harder than necessary then pulled out.  He could make it there in fifteen minutes so long as he ignored all those pesky stop signs.  There had to be some perks to being the head of MCU, other than the getting shot at.   He spun the wheel, taking the corner a bit faster than he should.  He was tempted to call Bruce back but he needed to concentrate on driving.  Chelsea's was too public for anything bad to happen, at least that was his hope.  He stepped on the gas.  This was Gotham, after all.  No use in tempting fate.

Jim pulled the door open, barely registering the welcome scent of coffee.  He glanced around, trying to find Bruce.  His heart clenched when he didn't see him.  He took a few steps in, just getting ready to call out for him when he spotted a dark head bent over a mug at one of the back tables.  He ducked around the waiting line, then settled into the seat across Bruce.

""Hey.""  Jim said, reaching out to touch Bruce's arm.  ""I'm here.""

Bruce looked up.  His eyes were red and he looked miserable.  ""Thank you, I didn't know who else to call.""

""What happened?""  Jim frowned, glancing around.  ""Bruce, are you here alone?""

Bruce nodded shakily.  ""Yeah, I kind of.""  He waved his hand.  ""Took off.""

""Took off?  What's going on?""  He looked at him closer.  ""Bruce, you need to tell me what's going on.""

Bruce looked down at the table, hands clenching around the mug.  Jim leaned back, carefully not pressing him.  He'd learned a long time ago that dealing with teenagers was remarkably like trying to get suspects to talk.  The more he pushed, the less information he'd get.

""Trent kissed me.""  Bruce finally said.  ""At my birthday party.""  Jim could see the flush on his cheeks.  

""He did?""  Jim kept his voice even.  ""What did you do?""

""Um.""  Bruce turned redder.  ""Kissed him back.""

Jim bit back a smile.  ""I see.""

Bruce glanced up.  ""You don't sound surprised.""

""I'm not.""  Jim smiled slightly.  ""I've seen how the two of you are around each other.""

""You could have told me,"" Bruce muttered.  He took a sip of his coffee.  ""That would have been nice.""

""That's something you needed to figure out on your own.""  Jim replied.  ""So is that why you're here?  Did you fight?""

""No!  No, that's, everything is great.""  That made Bruce smile a little.  ""Really great.""

Jim arched a brow at him.  ""Do we need to have a conversation about being safe?""

Bruce looked at him, surprised.  ""You're not going to give me the you're too young lecture?  And I, well, I know about"" Bruce made vague hand gestures.  ""That kind of stuff.""

""Here's a hint, if you can't say it, you're not ready to do it.  And you're seventeen Bruce, I'm not naive.  I do remember being that age.  Besides,"" Jim's lips twitched.  ""I would be an enormous hypocrite if I told you that you weren't ready.""

""A hypocrite?  What do you, oh.  Oh.""  Bruce's eyes went wide.  ""Oh.  Right.""

""Exactly.  So if it's not Trent, then what is it?""  Jim cast a wistful glance over to the counter.  ""And will I need coffee to deal with it?""

""When do you not?  Go, get some, I'll be here.""  Bruce nudged him with his foot.  ""I don't want you to go into withdrawal.""

""You're not any funnier than your mother when you say that.""  Jim pushed back.  ""Don't go anywhere.""  Bruce nodded and Jim headed up to get coffee.  He rubbed a thumb over the back of his phone, considering calling Thomas to tell him that Bruce was with him.  He glanced over to the table, noticing how Bruce was still huddled in the corner, trying to make himself invisible.  Maybe in a few minutes, when he found out what was going on.  He took his coffee, grateful that they knew exactly how he liked it by now.  He headed back to the table, tugging the chair over so that he was blocking Bruce from being seen by the rest of the room.  Bruce tended to forget how much attention he drew simply by who he was.  ""Okay, I'm properly caffeinated.  Talk.""

""Is that your interrogation look?  It's kind of intimidating.""  Bruce drew circles on the table with the tip of his finger.  ""I told Mom and Dad about Trent.""

Jim waited for Bruce to continue.  Bruce didn't say anything more and Jim frowned.  ""And?""

""And Dad freaked out.""  Jim barely heard it, Bruce's voice was so low.  ""He completely freaked.""

Jim stared at Bruce, trying to determine if he'd heard him wrong.  ""He what?""

""He freaked out.""  Bruce bit his lip, voice beginning to shake.  ""He told me that I was just confused and that I mistaking what I felt for Trent with something else and that I was too young to know what I wanted and that,"" Bruce stopped, shaking his head.  ""It doesn't matter.""

The wave of anger that washed through Jim took him by surprise.  He struggled to keep it from showing, to keep it from his voice.  ""Bruce, what else did he say?""

""It doesn't matter!""  Bruce looked up, eyes bright.  ""It was wrong and stupid and I don't understand.  I don't get it, why did he say those things, he's the one who always told me that there was nothing wrong with, with,"" Bruce swallowed, ""with being gay and that people are who they are and that it was fine.  I don't understand.""

""Is that why you're here?""  Bruce gave a small nod.  ""Bruce, you can't run like that, it won't solve anything.""

""He told me.""  Bruce bit his lip.  ""He told me that he didn't want to look at me right now.""

It took all of Jim's self-control not to let the rage he was feeling leak into his voice.  ""Bruce, you know he loves you.""

""Yeah, sure.  As long as I'm his perfect little straight son.""  Bruce's voice was as angry as Jim felt.  ""I hate him right now.""

""Don't say that, you don't mean it.""  Jim put a hand on Bruce's arm.  ""This will work out, Bruce, I'm sure he was shocked was all.""

""I don't know why, apparently everyone in the world knew it but me.  Mom smiled at me and said it was about time.""  Bruce shook his head.  ""I thought Dad would understand, I mean, you're his best friend and he likes Phil and he's never said anything like that before.""

""It's different when it's your child.""  Jim took a long drink, stalling for time.  The coffee helped wash the bitter taste of defending Thomas from his mouth.  ""Bruce, how long have you been gone?""

""I don't know, a few hours.  I kind of drove around for awhile and then I ended up here and then I called you.""  Bruce finished his coffee, spinning the mug on the table.  ""Do you think I'm too young to know?  Honestly, do you?""

""I'm not the best person to ask,"" Jim said wryly.  ""I knew when I was fourteen.""

""Really?""  Bruce stared at him.  ""I didn't know that.""

""No reason why you should.""  Jim shrugged.  ""I think that you need to figure this out in your own time.  Everyone is different.""

""I guess.  Do you, you like Trent, right?""  Bruce said anxiously.  ""He's really great and nice and smart and, you know, he's"" Bruce went red and Jim couldn't resist the urge to push the issue.

""He's what, interesting, well read, a great dancer?""  Jim nudged Bruce's foot.  ""You like his etchings?""

""Jim!""  Bruce sounded shocked then started laughing.  ""That was so lame.""

""Maybe,"" Jim grinned at him.  ""Seriously, Bruce, don't do anything that you aren't ready to do.  There's nothing wrong with taking your time.""

Bruce nodded, flushing bright red.  ""We haven't, we aren't, we've only,"" Bruce made more vague hand gestures and Jim felt himself flush.

""Trust me, I don't need details.""  Bruce looked relieved to hear that.  ""So, you like him?""

Bruce nodded, ""Yeah.  I like him a lot.""

""Good, you could do worse.""  Jim leaned back, taking another drink.  ""My first boyfriend?  Brain dead jock.""

""He was not!""  Bruce pointed at Jim.  ""There is no way that you dated someone stupid.""

""Hey, I was young and he was hot.""  Jim grinned as Bruce flushed bright red.  ""See, you don't want to hear about it either.""

""Shut up.""  Bruce wrinkled his nose.  ""It's weird is all, thinking about you being my age.""

""Thanks, I'll go get my walker now.""  Jim ducked when Bruce threw a balled up napkin at him.  ""You started it.""

""That was mature.""  Bruce rolled his eyes.  He looked much calmer, Jim was glad to see.  

""Why don't we,"" Jim started, then held up a finger when his phone rang.  He pulled it out, frowning when he saw who was calling.  ""He's with me.""  He didn't bother trying to keep the chill from his voice. 

""Jim, thank God.""  Thomas sounded frantic.  ""I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to overreact""

""I think that ship has sailed.""  Jim saw Bruce's eyes go wide.  ""I'm going to bring him home now.""

There was silence for a long moment.  ""He told you then.""

""Yes.  He did.  I'll see you in a bit.""  Jim snapped the phone shut.  ""Okay, it's time we got you home.""

""Was he mad?""  Bruce sounded scared, not that Jim blamed him.

""No, but you scared them.  I know you're upset and I'm not saying you shouldn't be, but don't do that again.""  Jim stood, nodding towards the door.  ""I'm taking you home.""

""But my car,"" Bruce stood following Jim out the door.

""We'll get it tomorrow, I don't think you should be driving right now.""  Jim led the way to his car, waiting until Bruce was in before climbing in himself.  ""I'm glad you called.""

""Me too.""  Bruce gave him a little smile.  ""Even if I did get teen angst all over you.""

Jim laughed, pulling out and heading for the Manor.

""Master Wayne is in the study, Lieutenant Gordon.""  Alfred reached to take his coat and Jim shook his head. 

""I'm not staying.""  Jim turned to Bruce, ""Can you give me a minute with your father?""

Bruce nodded.  ""Okay, thanks for bringing me home.""  He headed down the hall and Jim watched him turn the corner at the end of the hall.

""Should I prepare to scrub blood out of the carpet?""  Alfred looked at Jim steadily.  

""I hope it won't come to that.""  Jim headed for the study.  ""Please don't move the car, I'm planning on leaving in a minute.""  He didn't wait for Alfred's reply, pulling the study door open and then barely resisting the urge to slam it behind him.  Thomas turned to look at him and Jim held up a hand.

""Don't you dare say a word.""  He leaned back against the door, keeping as much space as possible between them.  ""I don't know what came over you and I don't really care.  Your son needed you and you failed him.  Completely.  If that's what you really feel, then you've done a hell of a job lying about it all these years.""  Jim felt his hands clench and he took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.  ""Don't fuck this up, Thomas.  Trust me, knowing your parents hate you for something you can't change is no way to go through life.  The next time he leaves because of something you said?  Don't assume I'll bring him back.""  Jim yanked the door open and left, trying to pretend he couldn't hear Thomas yelling ""Jim!  Jim, wait!""  He ran down the stairs and fell into his car, pulling out as fast as he could.  His hands were shaking and maybe he was the one who shouldn't be driving.  He didn't care.  All he knew was that he understood completely why Bruce had felt the need to get away.

Jim sat up with a start, trying to determine what woke him.  He listened and there it was again, a faint knocking on his door.  He shoved up from the couch, yawning widely as he padded over to the door.  He looked through the peep hole and sighed, resting his forehead against the door.  He waited another moment, getting his emotions under control before he opened the door.  ""Come on in.""  He stepped back, waving Thomas through the door.  He headed back to the living room, dropping down heavily on the couch.

""Hey.""  Thomas settled in the chair across from him.  ""Thanks for letting me in.""

Jim snorted.  ""I think we both know that we had maybe another twelve hours before your blushing bride dragged us both somewhere by our ears and told us to stop being assholes.""

""Try six.""  Thomas smiled faintly.  ""And I aspire to being called an asshole right now.""

""I bet.""  Jim looked at him, then pushed up.  ""You want a drink?""

""God, yes.""  Thomas leaned back, eyeing Jim's desk.  

""Go on, go on, we're in trouble now, might as well go all out.""  Jim grabbed them both a beer, then snagged an ash tray, setting it on the table.  Thomas tapped out a cigarette, then tossed the pack to Jim.  Jim pulled out a cigarette of his own, lighting it then handing the lighter over to Thomas.  They smoked in silence for a few moments before Thomas let out a harsh laugh.

""Thanks for not punching me in the throat.  I kind of deserved it.""  He tapped off some ash, then twisted the cap off his beer.  He took a long pull, then tipped the bottle in Jim's direction.  ""I would have.""

""Don't think the idea didn't cross my mind.""  Jim opened his beer.  ""I'm not sure I still won't.""

""Yeah.""  Thomas held the beer to his forehead.  ""Bruce told me that he told you what I said.""

""That he did.""  Jim took another drag on his cigarette.  ""You're damn lucky he called me and didn't keep running.  I did.""

""I know.""  Thomas shook his head.  ""I don't know how to explain it, Jim.   It was, I don't know what came over me.""

""Me either.""  Jim knew he sounded hostile but he couldn't help it.  ""For fuck's sake, if you've felt this way all along why the hell are we friends?""

""I don't!  I swear, I don't think any of that and we are friends and I just, I freaked out, that's all.""  Thomas stubbed out his cigarette, leaning forward, hands clasped between his legs.  ""I was shocked and I reacted without thinking and I know, believe me, I know that I handled that about as badly as I could.  That's not an excuse, I swear, it's not, but it's not like I planned it.""

""See, here's the thing,"" Jim took another drink.  ""It's what people say when they don't plan to that reveals how they really think.""

""Maybe you're right.""  Thomas dropped his head, staring at the floor. ""I'll admit it, I don't want Bruce to be gay.""

Jim closed his eyes tightly.  ""Yeah.  I picked up on that.  So did he, you of all people should know how smart he is.""

""I know, I know, but it's.  I've seen how difficult it is for you and how terrible things still are out there.""  Thomas waved a hand in the direction of the door.  ""I don't want things to be harder on him and it will be and I don't want that for him.""

""Don't you put this on me.""  Jim pointed at Thomas, anger clear on his face.  ""Don't you dare blame me for what you said.  For fuck's sake, Thomas, anyone with half a brain knows that Phil's not just a friend.  So I'm not marching in Pride, so what, I've never lied to you or Bruce or anyone who matters about who I am.""

""I'm not blaming you!""  Thomas stood, pacing back and forth, running a hand through his hair.  ""I'm not, I didn't mean for it to come out like that.  All I meant is that I know it's hard on you and I know how much you hate that everything with your parents is beyond fucked up and I know that you have to be careful for all kinds of reasons.  Forgive me for not wanting Bruce's life to be harder!""  

""That's not up to you.""  Jim finished off his cigarette, blowing out a long stream of smoke.  ""Thomas, he's going to be whoever he is no matter what you do.  It's up to you to decide if you can accept that.  If you can't?""  Jim shrugged.  ""Maybe it's better he knows that now.""

""I can, I do, he's my son and I love him.""  Thomas grabbed his beer, downing half of it.  ""I wish I could take it back.  Look, I don't blame either of you for being furious with me, hell, I'm furious with myself.  But can you at least accept that I didn't say any it from hate?""

Jim eyed him steadily for a moment then rolled his eyes.  ""Oh for fuck's sake, we're the ones acting like emotional teenagers now.  Of course you didn't, if you did you wouldn't be here, would you?""  

""Well, Martha is very convincing.""  Thomas smiled a little then dropped back into his chair.  ""So.  I was an asshole.""

""Pretty much.""  Jim smiled a little.  ""I'm going to be pissed for a bit.""

""Didn't think otherwise.""  Thomas finished off his beer, then sprawled out, head tipped back.  ""At least Trent's a good kid.""  He looked at Jim from the corner of his eye.  ""Not a brain dead football player.""

Jim gaped at him for a moment then groaned.  ""I never ever should have told him that.""

""No, no, I'm glad you did.  How else would I learn about your really embarrassing past.""  Thomas sounded a bit gleeful and Jim flipped him off.  

""Should I ask Alfred to show me pictures of your old girlfriends?  You know he has them.""  Jim grinned when Thomas made a face at him.  ""Trent is a good kid.""

""Yeah.""  Thomas shook his head.  ""Guess I get to live up to all those ideals of tolerance and acceptance I've preached at Bruce.""

""I guess you do.""  Jim finished off his beer.  ""I'll let you know when you fail utterly.""

""You do that.""  Thomas snagged the pack of cigarettes.  ""And hey, if Bruce ends up like you?  Not exactly going to complain about that.""

Jim flushed.  ""Shut up, Wayne.  Now, I say we talk about all the ways to utterly humiliate the two of them next time I'm over.""  Jim grinned when Thomas threw his head back and laughed.

It was ridiculous, truly and utterly ridiculous to be this jealous over something so stupid, Bruce thought, watching as Trent danced with Molly Parkinson.  It was stupid and juvenile and ridiculous and, wait, he'd said stupid, right?  Bruce took a drink of punch, hiding behind the cup.  Seriously, it was insane to be standing over on the side of the room seething about how Trent was dancing with Molly.  It wasn't like Trent liked Molly or anything.  Or that Molly liked Trent though the way her hand kept creeping ever closer to his ass may have been a subtle indication that wasn't exactly true.  Bruce couldn't blame her though, it was a fantastic ass.  He sighed, trying to lean back into the shadows.  The worst part about this all was that it was his fault.  It was totally and completely his fault that Trent was out there dancing with Molly instead of being back over there talking to Bruce.  Talking, flirting, maybe sneaking out the back to make out.  Bruce knocked his head off the wall.  He was an idiot, plain and simple.
	
Bruce watched Trent spin Molly around, her hair flying around her and a huge grin on her face.  It was insane to be angry that she was dancing with Trent, not him.  Hell, even if Bruce did have the guts to do something about how he felt about Trent, it wasn't like they could be out there dancing.  Yeah, sure, his parents were tolerant and all of that, Jim was his dad's best friend for fuck's sake, but dancing with another guy in public was probably pushing it too far.  Hell, Jim and Phil didn't even hold hands or do anything to overtly show they were together.  Bruce still hadn't figured out if that was because Jim wasn't huge on public displays of affection or because it wasn't exactly safe to be a gay cop.  There were enough people gunning for Jim's head without adding that to it.  So maybe dancing wouldn't be appropriate.  He just wanted to be the one who had all of Trent's attention.

Bruce slid out the side door, walking aimlessly across the grounds.  He didn't know what to do, he didn't know what to say, he didn't know how to handle this.  It wasn't so bad knowing that he liked guys.  He'd had at least an inkling that's what he wanted since he was thirteen.  Kissing Philipa last year confirmed that girls weren't really what he wanted.  So the whole guy thing was fine, it was.  It was the being in love with his best friend thing that really sucked.

He made his way down to the fountain, shoving his hands in his pockets.  It shouldn't be this hard.  It shouldn't.  He was pretty sure that Trent at least thought about guys sometimes.  He'd watched Trent, not much, but some, and he was pretty sure he'd seen Trent looking at guys that way.  But he'd never noticed Trent looking at him that way.  There was no way that he could do something or say something or, God, make a move on Trent without knowing that it wouldn't result in things getting all weird between them.  He'd rather not have to try to find a new roommate, not to mention best friend.  He flopped down on a bench, laying back, his hands tucked under his head.  He forgot sometimes how many stars you could see out here.  It was nice at school but it wasn't like being here.  

""You know, it's really not cool to ditch your own party.""  Bruce jerked up when he heard Trent's voice.  ""And it's incredibly not cool to leave me stuck up there with Molly.  Did you know she has toy poodles?  Three of them? And that she dresses them up in outfits to match hers?  Because now I do.  In detail.  Move over.""  Trent kicked at his leg and Bruce sat up, scooting over to give Trent room to sit down.

""Sorry, I was,"" Bruce glanced over, shrugging a little.  ""It was getting stuffy in there.""

Trent snorted.  ""Stuffy is right. What happened to the whole thing about you having like a couple of people over for pizza and cake?  I liked that idea.  Especially the cake part.""

""Don't get me started.  You know my mother, starts small and then it keeps going and going and going.""  Bruce smiled a little. ""Admit that the elephant was awesome.""

""Do I want to know where your mother found an elephant?  Wait, no, no I do not.""  Trent bumped shoulders with him.  ""By the way, happy birthday.""

""Thanks.""  Bruce leaned into Trent for a second, then pulled back.  ""Did you get sent to haul me back?""

""Nah, it's breaking up about now and you put in enough face time.""  Trent kicked his foot against Bruce's calf.  ""You want to tell me why you've been acting so weird the last few weeks?""

""I have not been acting weird, you're nuts.""  Bruce rolled his eyes.  ""Also, takes one to know one.""

""That was mature.  And you've totally been acting weird.  You've been all moping around and not eating, which is so so wrong I cannot even tell you, and listening to Morrissey.  You're totally acting weird.""  Trent said. 

""Listening to Morrissey is not weird!""  Bruce glared at him.  ""You have no taste is all.""

""Oh I have taste, believe me.  That's why I can say without any hesitation that you singing along is terrible.""  Trent nudged Bruce.  ""Come on, what's wrong?  You're acting like a love sick girl.""

Bruce felt his cheeks flush.  ""Fuck you, I am not.""

""God, that's it isn't it!""  Trent sounded delighted and Bruce felt the urge to punch him right in the face.  ""You're in love.""  Trent singsonged it and Bruce felt the urge to punch him grow stronger.

""I am not!  Shut up!""  Bruce pushed up, stalking to the other side of the fountain.  ""Why are you being such an ass?""

""Because you're trying to be all mystery man and be all secretive about it.""  Trent eyed him.  ""Hmm.  Let's see, who is it?  Not Philipa, she's still pissed at you for some reason.""  Trent snapped his fingers.  ""Oh right, because she chased after you and then you totally blew her off in front of everyone.  Yeah, she's going to kill you in your sleep one night, you know that.""

""Thank you so much for the reminder, I'd forgotten about that.""  Bruce kicked some gravel.  ""It's nothing, let it go.""

""Nope, can't do that.""  Trent shoved up, stalking over towards Bruce.  ""How about Padma?  She's smart enough and not exactly ugly.""

""That's a nice thing to say.""  Bruce shot back.  ""Not exactly ugly, wow, you've got a silver tongue there.""

""Oh, I'm supposed to say, hey, she's hot and has nice tits?""  Trent ducked the gravel Bruce kicked at him.  ""Exactly.  She's dating Paul though.  I cannot understand what she sees in him, he's as dumb as a rock.""

""I know, he's an idiot, I mean, sure he's hot and everything, but the hot doesn't make up for the stupid.""  Bruce's eyes went wide when he realized what he said.  He hoped that maybe, possibly, if there was a God, that Trent wouldn't notice it.

Trent looked at him evenly and Bruce fought to meet his gaze.  ""Yeah.  Paul is hot.  Funny, though, I didn't think that was something you would notice.""  There was an odd note to Trent's voice that he couldn't place.  

Bruce bit his lip, trying to think of something to say.  ""Well, it's not like it's not obvious.  I mean, even old ladies seem to like him.""  There, that seemed safe enough.

""Old ladies.  Right.""  Trent took a few steps closer, still looking at Bruce.  ""You know, I thought you got mad because I was dancing with Molly.""

""What, no, why would I get mad,""  Bruce stepped back, trying to keep some space between them.  ""That's stupid.""

""No, what's stupid is thinking that you were upset because Molly was dancing with me, not because I was dancing with Molly.""  Trent reached out, grabbing Bruce's wrist and pulling him close.

""I don't, that's not, I didn't.""  Bruce closed his eyes.  ""It's not like that.""

""Are you sure?""  Trent let go of Bruce's wrist, then took his hand, tangling their fingers together.  ""Because I was hoping that it would make you jealous and I'd hate to hear that it didn't work.""

Bruce's eyes flew open at that and he stared at Trent, mouth falling open. He tried to focus but he was distracted by the way Trent was smiling at him.  ""Really?""

""Yeah, really.  You know, I still can't figure out how you can be all Sherlock Holmes about everyone else and be totally clueless about yourself.""  Trent shook his head.  ""It's kind of sad.""

""Shut up.""  Bruce squeezed Trent's hand.  ""You wanted me to be jealous?""

""Of course I did.""  Trent pulled Bruce flush against him.  ""Do you get it now?""

""Well, I hope,"" Bruce grinned and Trent laughed.  He was still laughing when he leaned down and kissed Bruce.  Bruce grabbed onto Trent's back, holding tight as Trent licked into his mouth.  This, now this was what kissing should be like.  He held on as they stumbled backwards, Trent's hand running up under Bruce's shirt.  Bruce felt a bench hit the back of his legs and he just managed to keep them from falling over.  Trent laughed into his mouth and Bruce grinned.

""Maybe we should go somewhere else?""  Bruce kissed Trent, lips lingering against his.  ""Somewhere we won't fall over and have to try to explain what happened?""

""Where do you think we can go?""  Trent pulled Bruce's shirt out from his pants.  ""There's a ton of people up there.""

""I thought you said it was breaking up.""  Bruce tugged at Trent's shirt. 

""Yeah, I kind of lied a lot.""  Trent kissed him again and Bruce forgot whatever retort it was that he was going to say.  They stumbled back again and this time Bruce let them tumble down to the ground.  There was a rock digging into his back and he was pretty sure that he'd ripped a hole in his jacket but he didn't care.  Trent was kissing him and Trent's hands were on him and it was even better than he'd imagined. 

Bruce wasn't sure how long they'd been kissing when he heard Alfred's voice calling from just up the hill.  ""I do believe that Master Bruce is in the kitchen..""  They pulled apart, Bruce scrambling to his feet.  He tried to brush away the dirt and grass, hoping against hope that he didn't look as trashed as he knew he must be.  

""We're so busted,"" Trent said mournfully.  Bruce glanced over, then cracked up.  

""There's twigs in your hair.""  He reached out, pulling a few out and tossing them away. 

""You've got,"" Trent brushed his fingers against Bruce's cheek.  Bruce shivered.  ""Dirt.""

""That's sexy,"" Bruce said dryly, gratified when Trent cracked up.  ""You realize Alfred is never going to let us live this down.""

""No, of course not.""  Trent grabbed Bruce's hand, pulling him in for a fast kiss.  ""You think he'll blow the whistle or will he give us the rope to hang ourselves?""

""Oh the rope, totally the rope, you know how he is.""  Bruce ran a hand through Trent's hair.  ""So, you still want to stay over tonight?""

A slow grin spread across Trent's face.  ""Why Bruce Wayne, are you propositioning me?""

""God, yes.""  Bruce grinned.

""Then I accept.  After all, you're the birthday boy and you should get nice presents.""  Trent said, nodding firmly.

""I like how your mind works.""  Bruce started back up towards the house.  ""I say we sneak in the back.""

""Good thinking.  So, you're parents can't hear anything from your room, right?""  Trent skimmed a hand down Bruce's side.

""More importantly, I can't hear anything from theirs.""  Bruce looked over his shoulder.  ""Should I be worried that you're asking that?""

""Worried, no.  Anxious, yes.""  Trent smirked.  ""I've been waiting for you to get a clue for a long time.  I'm going to make up for that tonight.""

Bruce stumbled and Trent laughed.  He was still laughing when Bruce dragged him into the house.

How did we get dragged into this?""  Bruce hissed at Trent, trying to duck behind him.

""Hell if I know, last I remember you were the one who decided that we needed to broaden our social horizons.""  Trent shoved Bruce in front of him.  ""And you're taller, I get to hide.""

""Obviously that was a stupid idea and you're the brains of this and you should have stopped me.""  Bruce yanked Trent back around.  ""And you're wider.""

""Not all of us are sticks.""  Trent nudged Bruce in the ribs with an elbow.  ""What the hell do we do now?""

""I didn't think this out,"" Bruce admitted, staring across the room.  He really really hadn't thought this through.  Sure, fine, his mother was making noises about how it wasn't normal for him to hole up in his lab and work on machines all summer.  And, okay, fine, maybe he thought it would be fun to do something other than eat pizza and mock Alfred on a Friday night.  Not to mention that it was a gorgeous night and the start of summer and the start of vacation and it sounded like fun when the girl at the coffee place (and thank God his father decided to stop bitching at him about drinking coffee) came over and gave them the invite to the party.  It sounded like fun and Trent shrugged and said ""Hey, why not?"" and here they were.  Here they were surrounded by tons of people they didn't know in a place they'd never been and maybe they should just leave.  He opened his mouth to suggest that when Trent rolled his eyes and cut him off.  

""We're stranded remember?  I distinctly recall Alfred saying something about life lessons and learning opportunities and taking the over,"" Trent shook his head.  ""We've got to stick it out for three hours at least.""

""Alfred took the over?""  Bruce cheered up at hearing that.  ""That's great!""

""I think that's because it pays out more.""  Trent snorted.  ""I can't believe your family is betting on this.""

""I can.""  Bruce squinted a little.  ""I think I see Paul over there.""

""Where?""  Trent leaned around Bruce to look.  ""Holy shit, with the pink hair?""

""I think so,"" Bruce grinned at Trent.  ""We must fuck with him.""

""Hell, yes."" Trent grinned back.  ""This is going to be great.""  He grabbed Bruce's arm, dragging him through the room.  Bruce laughed, head tipping back.  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

Bruce guzzled down water, carefully screwing the lid back on the bottle.  Maybe it was paranoid, maybe it wasn't, but he'd listened when Jim sat him down a few months ago and gave him a lecture on being safe when he was out.  At the time, Bruce thought it was a nice, but weird, thing to do.  Now?  Now he understood.  He'd be the first to admit that he lived a sheltered life.  That didn't mean he was naive.  There were people out there who would look at all the people milling around and dancing and making out in the corners and see a hunting ground.  He listened when Jim was talking to his dad when they thought he couldn't hear.  He knew that evil existed and was closer than you thought.  He looked around, making sure that Trent was still over there talking to the girls they ran into trying to get something to drink.  He lifted his bottle in a salute and Trent gave a little wave back.  Bruce smirked when Trent mouthed ""help me"".  He shook his head mouthing ""Your fault"" back.  He pointed in the direction of the bathroom and Trent nodded.  Bruce started working his way through the crowd, starting to feel a little overwhelmed by the press of people around him.  He finally slithered through, doggedly not looking at the couple he was pretty sure were well on their way to having sex right there.  That was way more than he wanted to see.  He took care of business, washed his hands and then headed back out.  He stopped, looking around, trying not to worry when he didn't see Trent.  He stretched up, trying to see over the crowd.

""Lose your friends?""  Bruce glanced over.  The man standing next to him gave him a knowing look.  ""I bet he met up with some girls and took off.""

""No, he's not like that and I'm his ride anyway.""  Bruce returned to scanning the crowd.  ""I'm sure he's around.""

""Yeah, you're right.""  The man sounded amused.  ""Because no one ever does anything like dumping his friends to go off with a girl.""

Bruce shot the guy a glare, trying not to let it show that he was starting to worry a little.  ""I'm sure he's here.""

""I'm sure he is.""  The man slung an arm around Bruce's shoulders.  ""You here alone then?""

Bruce tried not to tense up, looking over to take a good look at the man.  Almost as tall as him, blond hair that looked badly dyed.  Green eyes, mustache.  And he had a look on his face that Bruce couldn't quite place.  It made the hair on the back of his neck rise. 

""No.""  He didn't realize he was going to lie until he did.  ""There's five of us.""  He pointed over to where he could see Paul's hair glowing in the lights. 

""Ah, I see.""  The man didn't let go and Bruce felt a curl of fear go through him.  ""Pity.""

""What?""  Bruce tugged free, not liking how the man didn't want to let go.  ""Why a pity?"" 

""No reason really.""  The man shrugged, the corner of his mouth curling up.  ""I'll see you around.""  The man stepped away and Bruce watched as he slipped into the crowd.  He wanted a moment, then started to follow him.  He wasn't sure why, but there was something strange about him and Bruce couldn't hold back the urge to follow.  He fell back, attempting to stay lost in the people dancing around him.  The man wandered the perimeter of the room, sometimes talking to people, sometimes just watching.  A chill went through him when he realized that the man was only talking to teenage boys with dark hair and dark eyes.  

""Bruce, where the hell have you been?""  Trent bumped his shoulder, voice raised to carry over the music.

""Shut up.""  Bruce didn't take his eyes of the man.  ""I need you to do something.""

""What the hell, I'm not your manservant,"" Trent stopped.  ""Something's up.""

""Maybe.  I don't know, there's something strange going on.""  Bruce nodded with his head in direction of the man.  He was involved in a deep conversation with someone, his arm around his shoulders, holding too tight.  ""I need you to watch him and make sure he doesn't leave.""

""What?""  Trent stared at him then blinked hard.  ""You're freaking me out.""

""I'm freaking me out.  I'll be right back, do not let him leave.  I'll be back in a second.""  He started digging in his pocket for his phone, grateful for once that his mother demanded he carry one.  

""What do you want me to do if he tries to go, hit him or something?""  Trent called after him and Bruce shrugged.  

""You'll think of something, I know you.""  Bruce headed for the front, trying to get somewhere that he could talk without yelling.  He dialed the number from memory, hoping that he was right to call there first.

""MCU, Gordon speaking.""  The familiar voice filled his ear and Bruce felt a rush of relief.

""Jim, it's Bruce, I, I,"" he paused feeling stupid. It was going to sound stupid when he said it out loud.

""Bruce?""  Jim sounded worried.  ""Bruce, are you alright?  Is something wrong?  Where are you?""

""I'm down in the warehouse district, 1341 Riverview, there's a party down here.  And I think there's something wrong.""  He hated that his voice was shaking a little.

""What is it?  Are you hurt?""  Bruce could hear Jim moving around.  ""Do you need me to come down?""

""I'm fine, I promise but there's a guy.""  Bruce forced himself to stay calm while he told Jim what happened.  ""I'm overreacting, I know, but he really creeped me out.""

""I'm on my way there.  I want you to stay there and stay visible and if anyone tries to get you to leave, I want you to remember what I showed you about breaking holds.  I'll be twenty minutes at the most.  Bruce, you did the right thing to call me.  I'll be right there.""  Jim hung up and Bruce snapped his phone shut, shoving it back into his pocket.  He rubbed the back of his neck, then headed back in to find Trent.  If Jim was coming then there was something going on and he wasn't going to leave Trent alone.  His heart began to pound when he didn't see Trent at first.  He started to walk around the room, not bothering to keep a low profile when he saw Trent across the room.  He headed straight for him, grabbing his elbow when he got close.

""He's still talking to that other guy.""  Trent bit his lip, looking worried.  ""It's weird.""

""I called Jim.  He's on the way here.""  Bruce moved around Trent, trying to block the man from seeing him.  ""He said to stay here, stay visible and not leave.""  

""Sounds good to me,""  Trent replied.  ""You don't think it's that freak do you?""

""I don't know, maybe.""  Bruce tried to look over without being obvious.  ""Did you see anything weird?""

""No, they're talking and the freak's kept his arm around him almost the whole time.""  Trent frowned, thinking.  ""And he got them some drinks.""

Bruce turned back to face Trent.  ""Drinks?  Like bottle or what?""

""No, cups, why does it matter?  Wait, you don't think he slipped him something do you?""  Trent leaned around Bruce and Bruce pulled him back.  

""No.  I don't know.  Look, I'm probably overreacting and it's nothing but he creeped me out when he talked to me.""  Bruce glanced over again.

""He talked to you?""  Trent pulled Bruce over to him.  ""What the hell?""

""When I went to the bathroom, he started talking to me and then put his arm over my shoulders and wanted to know if I was alone.  It was weird.""  They took turns watching the two of them talking.  It didn't seem like the man knew he was being watched.  He continued talking to the other man, pulling him closer and closer.  Bruce watched, starting to worry that the other guy was starting to sway on his feet.  ""Fuck.  Oh fuck.""

""What, what?""  Trent peered around Bruce.  ""Holy shit, that guy looks like he's going to pass out.""

""Yeah, c'mon.""  Bruce grabbed Trent's wrist, pulling him along behind him.  ""Something's wrong.""  They made their way over, Bruce angling them so that they'd block the way to the door.  The man was trying to help the other guy, who was starting to sway.  Bruce moved faster, not wanting to let them get away.  

""Oh hey sorry.""  Bruce bumped right into the man, hand on his arm.  ""Didn't see you there.""

The man shot him a venomous look then pasted on a false smile. ""Oh.  Hey.  I see you found your friend.""

""Yeah,"" Trent said.  ""And yours looks like he's not doing well.""

""He's fine, just over heated, you know how it is."" The man gave them another smile, this looking even faker than the first.  ""I'm going to help him outside.""

""I'm fine,"" the other man slurred.  ""I'm fine.""  His eyes weren't focused and Bruce could see a sheen of sweat over his face.  

""Hey, do you need help, you don't look so good.""  Trent put his hands on the guy's shoulders, holding him up.

""He's fine, just got a little hot with all the people in here.  We're going out to get some fresh air and he'll be fine.""  The man tried to grab the guy's arm again and Bruce stepped in between them.

""I think he needs an ambulance, my dad's a doctor and he looks really sick to me.""  Bruce made sure to keep his voice level, his skin crawling at the look on the man's face.  For a moment Bruce thought the man was going to punch him, he looked so enraged. 

""I didn't know that medical knowledge was genetic.""  The man snapped then visibly calmed himself.  ""Fine, you know, whatever, that's what I get for trying to be a Good Samaritan.""  He started to walk off and Bruce panicked, not knowing what to do.

""Yeah, you're a great citizen."" Trent shot back.  He looked at Bruce, then wrapped an arm around the guy's waist.  ""You follow, I'll get an ambulance.""

Bruce gave him a grateful look, then started to follow the man.  He watched as he headed for the back doors and Bruce panicked, not sure what to do.  He wasn't sure how long it was until Jim got there and he wasn't going to leave, he knew that would be stupid but he couldn't let the man get away.  He was starting to give serious consideration to tackling the man when he saw the man stop and turn for the bathrooms.  He set up guard outside the door, relief flooding through him when he saw Jim striding towards him.

""He's in there, I'll show you when he comes out.""  Bruce said in a rush.

""Fine.  Then I want you and Trent to go home, I called Alfred and he's probably waiting out there right now.""  Jim said.  ""Don't argue with me about this, Bruce.""

Bruce opened his mouth to argue, then nodded.  ""Okay.""  He knew when he wouldn't win.  

""You're not hurt?""  Jim looked at him intently and Bruce flushed.

""I'm fine, Jim.""  Jim squeezed his shoulder.  ""That's him.""  Bruce hissed, gesturing with his chin.

""Go home, Bruce.  I'll call you later.""  Jim turned to follow the man, jaw set.  Bruce watched him for a moment then headed for the front.  

""Jim?""  Bruce grabbed the phone on the first ring.  ""Jim, what happened?""

""What would you have done if it wasn't me?"" Jim sounded exhausted.

""Apologized like I've been doing.  What happened?""  There was no point in beating around the bush.  Bruce didn't think he could hold back asking even if he tried.

""I might as well tell you, it's all over the news.  You were right to call.  We're pretty sure that's the guy we've been looking for about the murders.""  Jim said quietly.  ""Bruce, you probably saved that kid's life.""

Bruce swallowed hard, trying to think of something, anything to say.  ""The other guy, he's okay?""  

""He'll be fine, don't worry about that.  How are you?""  Jim asked.

""Me?  I'm fine.  Freaked out a little bit, but fine.""  Bruce drummed his fingers on the counter.  ""I'm glad I listened to you about being careful when I'm out.""

""Me too.  I have to talk to your father, we're going to need you to come down and give a statement.  Bruce, I can't tell you how proud of you I am.""

""Thanks.  Are you okay?  You sound awful.""  That startled a laugh out of Jim and Bruce smiled. 

""Tired as hell but nothing some sleep won't cure.  I'll try to make it up tomorrow, okay?""  Jim said.

""Okay.  I'll see you tomorrow hopefully.  I'll get Dad.  Bye, Jim.""  Bruce heard Jim's soft ""Bye, Bruce"" as he headed for his dad's office.  He gave his father the phone, then ran up the stairs to his room.  He had to tell Trent what happened.  They'd saved some guy.  Now maybe Trent would stop calling him a voyeuristic freak for watching people the way he did.

Phil eyed the mall warily, ""How did we get talked into doing this again?""

""We, by which I mean you, agreed that sure, we'd love to handle Christmas shopping despite we, by which I mean I, frantically waving my hands and mouthing no at you.""  Jim said dryly.  ""You have met Martha Wayne, yes?  So tall,"" Jim held up a hand, ""gorgeous, rich and possessed of the wiles of Cleopatra.""

""I thought she meant some nice charity thing, or, you know, giving puppies away, not this.""  Phil glared at Jim.  ""You could have stopped me.""

""What?  By jumping up and down?""  Jim replied.  ""This is all on you, doc.  All on you.""

""You're so kind to me in my hour of despair,"" Phil took a sip of coffee, making a face.  ""This is awful.""

""That's what you get for not listening to me and getting some from the gas station.  Now, shut up and help me find them.""  Jim stretched up, trying to see through the crowd.  ""We took our eyes off of them for two seconds.""

""I told you we should put leashes on them but nooooo.""  Phil leaned in the opposite direction.  ""Seriously, where did they go?""

""You're the one who gave them sugar, yet more proof that this is all your fault.""  Jim tried to work his way over to the railing. 

""Yeah, well, you're the one who tracks down missing people on a daily basis, so, obviously, it's your fault that we lost them.""  Phil held up a hand when Jim stared at him.  ""No, I don't know how that follows either but give me that.""

""Fine.""  Jim finally reached the railing.  He leaned over, scanning the mass of people below them.  ""This is ridiculous.""

""It really is.""  Phil placed his hand on Jim's back, rubbing a little.  ""We'll find them.""

""We better, I'm not up to explaining to Martha how we managed to lose her son.""  Jim scanned the stores again.  ""Oh for fuck's sake, we're idiots.""

""You maybe,"" Phil said, grinning when Jim jabbed an elbow into his ribs.  ""Okay, okay, what?""

Jim pointed to the other side of the mall.  ""Bookstore.""

""Fuck, we're idiots.""  Phil tossed back the rest of his coffee and then threw the cup into a trash can.  ""I'll go left, you go right?""  

""Sounds like a plan.""  Jim pushed his glasses back up.  ""I should have brought a tazer.""

""Yeah, that's exactly the press you need.  'Billionaire's son electrocuted while reading classics.'  The Mayor will love that.""  Phil started making his way determinedly through the crowd.  ""You are getting me drunk tonight.""

""You're on call, remember?  But I'll let you watch me get drunk.""  Jim held onto the sleeve of Phil's jacket as they fought their way through the crowd. 

""That helps me how?  Excuse me.""  Phil tried to duck around the gaggle of strollers ahead of them.

""Well,"" Jim leaned in, using the crowd as an excuse to press against Phil's back.  ""If you recall, I tend to be amenable to your suggestions about alternate uses for my handcuffs when drunk.""

Phil stopped and Jim smacked into his back.  ""That is so not fair to say when we're in public.""

""Consider this payback for showing up at the station in scrubs last week.""  Jim gave him a push.  ""Come on, we have to get them out of there before they buy the store.""

""It's frightening that you mean that literally.""  Phil managed to weave them through, then turned and grinned at Jim in victory.  ""I should be a sherpa.""

""I thought you were morally opposed to doing things outside.""  Jim glanced around the store.  ""Okay, time to flank them.""

""That sounds so wrong.""  Phil ducked out of the way.  ""Fine, fine, but you get to deal with the whining when we make them go.""

""Deal.""  Jim started down the aisle, trying to decide the best place to start.  Probably military history, Bruce was on some weird kick about it lately.  Jim was choosing not to think about it too much.  If Bruce was seriously intent on taking over the world, well, he'd deal with it later.  He turned a corner and there was Bruce, sitting on the floor, stacks of books surrounding him.  Jim blinked hard.  He forgot sometimes how tall Bruce was getting to be.  

""I thought we agreed that you and Trent wouldn't take off without telling us where you were going?""  Jim folded his arms, leaning against the shelves.

""Jim!""  Bruce's head whipped up.  ""What?  I thought we told you, I mean, I know I said,"" Bruce frowned thinking and Jim stared down over his glasses at him.  ""Well fuck.""

""Language.""  Jim fought to keep from smiling.  

Bruce snorted.  ""I've heard you and Dad talking, you know.  I know you say stuff like that.""

""Privilege of being a grown up, one of the few.""  Jim gestured at the books.  ""You cannot possibly be planning on buying all of those.  Weren't you complaining last night about how much school work you have and how you don't have any free time and how you were being, what was it, worked into an early grave?""

""Yeah, but it's vacation, I can finish,"" Bruce glanced at the stacks, ""most of these.  A good part.  Some.  Maybe this one?""  He held up the one he was reading and Jim laughed.

""Fine, that one.  And a couple more, but that's it.""  Jim slid down to sit on the floor facing Bruce.  ""What is it with you and military history lately?""

""I don't know,"" Bruce shrugged.  ""It's interesting.  I like learning about the different strategies used and the intelligence stuff and how even the largest army is vulnerable to attack from a knowledgeable small group.  It's funny, you'd think with all the technological changes that the strategies would be completely different but that's not the case.""  

Jim smiled as Bruce launched into a lecture about the similarities between World War I trench warfare and Greek battle plans.  It never failed to amaze him just how smart Bruce was, let alone how he remembered all that he did.  He nodded at the appropriate places, grinning harder when Bruce leaned forward, showing him the passage he was trying to dispute.  ""So that's the book you're getting?""

""What?  Oh.""  Bruce flushed.  ""Sorry, sorry, I got carried away again.""  

""Just a little bit.""  Jim held his fingers apart.  ""Come on, we need to hunt down Trent and Phil before Trent completes Phil's descent into comic geek hell.""

Bruce snorted.  ""It's your fault, you're the one who let Trent tell him all, and I do mean all, about Superman.""

""I was trying to be nice to your friend.""  Jim said haughtily.  Bruce laughed at that and Jim poked him with his foot.  ""Be polite to your elders.""

""Oh, I'm being polite.""  Bruce pushed up.  ""So.  Um.  Can I ask you something?""

""Sure.""  Jim staggered up as well, rubbing at his knee.  Bruce shot him a worried look and Jim waved a hand.  ""I'm fine, it's the cold is all.""

""Yeah.""  Bruce bit his lip.  ""Um.  You and Phil.  It's, is it,"" Bruce looked at the floor and Jim could just see the flush on his cheeks.  ""I know I'm not supposed to ask but.""

""Do you want to know if he's my boyfriend?""  Jim kept his voice pitched low enough for only Bruce to hear.  Bruce nodded slowly.  ""Yes, yes, he is.""

""Yeah?  Is he, you like him, right?""  Bruce rolled his eyes.  ""I mean obviously, you wouldn't be with someone you hated.""

""I would hope not.""  Jim watched Bruce carefully.  ""It doesn't bother you?""

""Why would it bother me?""  Bruce bent to gather up the books, carefully not looking at Jim.  ""It's not wrong.""

""A lot of people think it is.""  Jim replied.

""A lot of people are fucking idiots and don't yell at me, that's deserved.""  Bruce put a few books back.  ""I'm getting most of these for Dad for Christmas.""

""How noble of you to give gifts you can borrow.""  Jim reached out, taking a few from Bruce.  ""Not these.  Six is enough.""  He ignored Bruce's attempt at puppy dog eyes.  ""I'm immune to that now.""

""Sure you are.  That's why you let us use the sirens the other night.""  Bruce tucked the books under his arm.  ""Can I ask you something else?""

""Oh, you're not done with the interrogation?""  Jim raised an eyebrow.  ""Go ahead.""

""So, well, how did you know that you, um, you know,"" Bruce glanced towards the back of the store.  ""Liked guys?""

Jim looked at Bruce closely.  ""Is there something you want to tell me?""

""What, no!  No, I don't, it's not, I mean,"" Bruce stopped, closing his eyes tightly.  ""Not here anyway.""

""Okay.""  Jim squeezed his shoulder.  ""If there's ever anything you do want to talk about, you can tell me, you know that.""

""I know.  It's, I don't know.  Confusing.""  Bruce smiled a little at him.  ""Also really really annoying.""

That made Jim laugh hard.  ""Trust me, Bruce, every relationship is that way.  Every single one.""

""Every what?""  Trent poked his head around the end of the aisle.  ""Oh my God, Bruce, you are the biggest dork on the planet.""

""I am not!  And that's rich coming from someone who just bought an entire run of,"" Bruce grabbed at Trent's shopping bag, ""Oh.  My.  God.  Veronica?  Seriously, Veronica?""

""It's for my cousin!  It is!  You suck!""  Trent shoved at Bruce's shoulder.  ""Stop laughing!""

""No, no, that's great, it's sweet and I bet you're only going to read them to see that they aren't damaged.""  Bruce danced back, trying to avoid Trent swinging the bag at him.  They headed for the front to check out, Bruce making fun of Trent the whole way.

""Well, now, that's interesting.""  Phil slung an arm around Jim's shoulders.

""What?""  Jim resisted the urge to lean into Phil.  ""And do not think you can hide that bag.  I don't even want to know how much money you spent.  Geek boy.""

""Shut up.  And them.""  Phil nodded with his chin.  ""Did you know Trent's staying with the Waynes for Christmas?""

""His parents abandoning him again, then.""  Jim shook his head.  ""I do not understand that.""

Phil smiled slightly.  ""I think you do.""

""Don't start with that again.""  Jim said.  ""We're never going to agree on that.""

""Fine, fine.  But that's not what I meant.""  Phil gestured slightly and Jim looked over to where Bruce and Trent stood in line.  They were completely focused on each other, Bruce beaming at something Trent said.  They were standing just a bit too close, even considering the crush of people around them.  ""Look familiar?""

""Maybe."" Jim admitted.  ""I'm not sure Bruce really understands what he's feeling.""

""Did you?""  Phil shrugged.  ""He'll struggle through it in his own time.""

""That's what I'm worried about.""  Jim took off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes.  ""I don't want him to have to go through that.""

""I know,"" Phil said softly.  ""But look at it this way, he'll have you and his parents.  Hell, he's got us as an example, that's more than a lot of kids get.""

""Great example I am,"" Jim muttered.  ""Great example on how to hide.""

""We really really aren't going to have this conversation again.  It's not hiding, it's being discreet, that's different.""  Phil gave his shoulder a squeeze.  ""If we were hiding, you wouldn't let me do that and we wouldn't have been dragooned into overseeing two teenagers Christmas shopping and that is so not my fault in any way and I wouldn't be your date to the big huge Christmas party I'm dragging you to at work.""

""Dragooned?  Really?  Dragooned?  Did you get into the word a day calendars?""  Jim shot Phil a glare.  ""What Christmas party?""

""The one next week that I'm telling you about right now.""  Phil gave Jim a slight push.  ""You better get over there, they just discovered the chocolate display.""

""That'll end well.""  Jim headed towards the counter.  ""What makes you think I'm going with you?""

Phil leaned in, whispering in his ear ""Because you love what me seeing you in a tux does to me.""

Jim glared at him over his shoulder.  ""Stop it.  We're in public.""

""Yeah.""  Phil smirked.  ""I know.  I like seeing you rattled, cop.""

""You're worse than them.""  Jim smiled though.  ""Come on, doc, the sooner we get them out of here, the sooner we can get back to your place.""

""Now you're talking.""  Phil strode forward, an intent look in his eye.  ""Besides, I want one of those hazelnut bars.""

Jim looked upwards, ""Whatever I did to deserve this, I'm sorry.""

Bruce glanced up when the door opened.  Trent stepped through, then closed the door carefully behind him before walking over to his desk, sitting down and opening one of his books.  He started reading, jotting some notes on a tablet.  Bruce waited for him to say something, to acknowledge Bruce in some way or at least to indicate that he knew he wasn't alone.  A few minutes passed before Bruce scowled.

""What crawled up your ass and died?""  Bruce turned his chair so that he was facing Trent. 

""What the hell are you talking about?""  Trent didn't as much as glance at Bruce.  ""I'm sitting here trying to get my Latin homework done.  Let me guess,"" he glanced over at Bruce, a bit of a sneer on his face.  ""You got it done hours ago and in like ten minutes.  What with being perfect and all that.""

""The fuck is wrong with you.  Yeah, I got it done but only because I don't wait until the last possible second.  Unlike other people in this room.""  Bruce spun back around.  ""But hey, whatever, be a jerk and see if I help when you get stuck.  Which you will.""

""Fuck.  You.""  Trent hurled back.  There was nothing but the sound of their pens moving over paper for several minutes.  Bruce could feel his neck and shoulders starting to ache from how stiff he was holding himself.  But he would be damned if he was the one who broke first.  He didn't do anything, he was the one sitting there trying to get ahead on his lit paper when Trent came back acting all weird.  He wasn't the one who started it and he wasn't the one who was going to end it.  If Trent wanted to be an ass, hey, fine.  Bruce was more than happy to let him.

Trent started muttering under his breath and Bruce steadfastly ignored it.  No.  He wasn't interested and he didn't care and it didn't mean anything that he was clenching his pen so tightly that his fingers were starting to cramp.

""Look.  Can you,"" Trent sighed heavily.  ""I can't get this part.""

""What I'm supposed to help you now?  Oh, right, I'm perfect and that's what perfect people do.  I get it.  Sorry, but I'm not perfect so you'll have to figure it out yourself.""  Bruce battled down the surge of guilt for sounding like such an ass.  He was in the right here, he was.  And Trent needed to learn this stuff on his own, not just rely on Bruce to help him out.  He wasn't being a jerk, he was helping.  Tough love and all of that.

""Bruce.""  There was a long pause and Bruce steadfastly kept his back to Trent.  ""C'mon.  Please.""  The last word was said so quietly that Bruce wasn't sure he'd really heard it at first.  ""Bruce.""

Bruce pushed back from the desk, then walked over, leaning over Trent's back.  He rested a hand on Trent's shoulder to keep his balance, maybe squeezing a little bit too but that didn't mean anything.  ""You messed up your conjugations again.  Also, tempus is time, not tide.""  Bruce squinted.  ""Is that part in French?""  He leaned a bit closer, trying to decipher Trent's handwriting.  ""Seriously, what the hell, Trent, this is a huge mess.""  He grabbed the pages and then pulled back, sitting down on the end of Trent's bed.  ""Are you drunk or something?  Did you have a stroke?""  He waved a page at Trent.  ""This part isn't even in any human language and you know Dr. Darby will flip out if you hand in something with equations in the margin again.""  

""You know damn well that those equations were helpful.  He's mad because I provided scientific proof that learning Latin is utterly useless to real life in any way.""  Trent scowled at Bruce.  ""You know I suck at this.""

""You don't suck at this, you don't care about this so you don't give a shit if you get it right.""  Bruce leaned over the side of the bed, stretching to grab a pen.  ""I'll mark it up but I am not doing this for you.""  He started marking up the page, snorting a little.  ""Maybe I should circle what you got right.  That would take less time.""

""Oh bite me.""  Trent sounded tired.  ""I'll do your calculus.""

""I rock at calculus and you know it.""  Bruce looked up at him.  ""What's wrong with you tonight?""

Trent spun a pen around his fingers.  ""Nothing.""

""Yeah, that was the most convincing thing I've ever heard.  Better sign up for play tryouts, you're a natural.""  Bruce set the papers down, leaning in towards Trent a bit.  ""C'mon, tell me.""

Trent stared at him for a moment and Bruce stared back.  Trent finally looked away and muttered something too quietly for Bruce to hear.

""What?  I don't have, like, bat hearing, try saying it so humans can hear.""  Bruce nudged Trent with his foot.  ""Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me.""

""God, you're such a two year old.  Fine.""  Trent took a breath and then said in a rush.  ""I talked to my mom tonight.""

Bruce blinked.  ""I thought you said that you weren't going to be able to talk to them for another couple of weeks.  They're back from Brazil?""

""Paraguay.  Yeah.  Apparently they got back early and had to come back to Gotham for something so she called.""  Trent's voice was brittle.  ""They've been in town for three days or something like that.""

""And they didn't come to see you?""  Bruce regretted saying it as soon as the words left his mouth.  He regretted it more when he saw the hurt on Trent's face.  ""Sorry.""

""No, it's a fair question.  I asked her that myself and she said that they were really busy and couldn't make the time but she was going to have the stuff they got me couriered over tomorrow.""  Trent stood up and started to pace.  ""They're off to, fuck, I don't even care.  But guess who gets to stay in the dorms for Christmas.  Again.""  Trent started walking faster and Bruce watched him, head moving in time to Trent's movements.  

""Come home with me.""  Bruce said.  ""It'll be great, we've got, hell, a wing if you want it, you'd be over all the time anyway.  It'll be easier if you stay over so this is better.""

""Oh, yeah, it's so much better that I crash at your place because my own fucking parents do not give enough of a shit about their son to see him for Christmas, yeah, that's better.""  Trent stopped walking, hands curled into fists at his side.  ""I don't know why they even bothered to have me.  It's not like they care.""

""They care.""  Bruce replied.  Trent stared at him.  ""Yeah, okay, I'll admit that could have sounded more persuasive.""

Trent flopped on the bed and Bruce scooted over to give him some room. ""I asked my mom once, did I ever tell you that?""  Bruce shook his head.  ""Yeah.  Do you know what she said?""  Bruce shook his head again.  ""Darling, what a silly question, of course we wanted you, you're such a blessing.""  Trent's impression of his mother's voice was scarily accurate, right down to the false note of cheerfulness that always set Bruce's teeth on edge.  ""Yeah.  Such a blessing they shipped me off here the first chance they got.""

Bruce picked at the blanket, trying to come up with something to say.  ""I'm glad you're here.  I mean, I'd probably be stuck rooming with Paul or Steve or somebody with smelly feet.   Smellier.  Someone has to have smellier feet than you.  Maybe.""  That got him a tiny smile and Bruce felt a surge of pride.  He poked Trent in the side.  ""It's not that bad.""

""That from the kid who sees his parents at least once a week, talks to his mom every day and who gets care packages from his freaking butler like twice a month.""  Trent poked him back.  ""You're so freaking spoiled, Master Bruce Wayne, Prince of Gotham.""

""Oh fuck you!""  Bruce smacked at Trent's arm.  ""That fucking reporter was a jackass.""

Trent smirked at him.  ""Aw, does little Brucey Wucey not like being on the cover of a magazine for doing, oh wait, you didn't do anything you were just born.  Poor baby.""

Bruce grabbed a pillow, slamming it over Trent's face.  ""They told Mom it was going to be about the school and the scholarship thing and the new lab and stuff!""

Trent struggled to push Bruce off and Bruce pressed down harder.  Trent finally managed to flip them over, grabbing the pillow and slamming it down over Bruce's face.  ""Yeah, the Wayne Foundation scholarships for the school that six generations of Waynes attended and the new Wayne Lab in the Wayne Wing.  Yeah, who didn't see which way that story was going to go?""

Bruce managed to get an arm free and held up his hand, flipping off Trent.  Trent started laughing hard and Bruce took the opportunity squirm out from under him.  ""I liked it better when I was still taller than you.""  He panted hard for a minute, then kicked Trent.  ""Mom's still really pissed about it.""

""God, what's she going to do?""  Trent shuddered a little.  ""I'm scarred from life from her yelling at us about the tree.""

""That was so not fair, it's not like we meant for it to catch on fire.""  Bruce said.  ""I asked Alfred what she was going to do and he said something about accessories before the fact and plausible deniability and I decided I really really didn't want to know.""

""Good choice.""  Trent leaned into Bruce.  ""Do you really think I can stay with you for Christmas?""

Bruce snorted.  ""I think I'll be staying here with you if Mom finds out I didn't have you come over.  I kind of like my life to not suck and Mom being mad at me?  That makes my life suck.  Kind of,"" he paused trying to think of the right word.

""All of it?""  Trent offered and Bruce nodded.

""Hell, yes, all of it.  Do you want to stay the whole time?  I mean,"" Bruce flushed.  ""I'd like it if you did.  It gets kind of boring when it's me and all the adults.""

""So you've finally accepted you aren't thirty?""  Trent placed a hand on Bruce's forehead.  ""Are you sick?  You don't feel like you have a fever.""  Trent tried to sound concerned, succeeding mainly in sounding amused.  ""Miracles never cease it seems.""

""Fuck.  And. You.  I don't act like I'm thirty!""  Bruce shoved Trent's hand away.  

""I hate to break it to you, but you kind of really do.  You even like those parties and that I don't understand.  It's not like Alfred's ever going to let you sneak a drink.""  Trent patted Bruce on the head.  ""No matter how hard you try.""

""The parties are interesting if you know how to watch.""  Bruce pushed up, scooting up the bed to lean against the headboard.  ""For example, I know that Mayor Todd is having an affair with Mrs. Rosenbaum.""

""Shut up, you cannot possibly know that.""  Trent sat up as well, sitting cross legged facing Bruce.

""I totally can.  It's how they talk to each other, you know? Like, they lean in a little too close to each other, they're always touching each other on the arms, they smile all the time even when the subject is boring and they don't pay attention to anyone else in the room.  They're totally sleeping together.""  Bruce sounded smug.  ""I know I'm right.""

""You are such a voyeur.""  Trent sounded impressed.  ""Do you watch people at school like that?""

Bruce shrugged.  ""I guess, it's kind of habit by this point.  I've always paid attention to details.""

""Huh.  Do you do it to me?""  Trent narrowed his eyes.  ""You better not.""

""Please, you're boring.""  Bruce rolled his eyes.  ""Not to mention you're usually talking to me.  Besides, you'd tell me if you liked someone.""

Trent flushed a bit.  ""Yeah, I guess.  So, okay, you spend the time trying to figure out who's doing what with who?  Like I said, pervy voyeur.""

""I do not!  I pay attention is all.  I mean, sometimes it's stuff like who likes to eat what or who keeps going to the bathroom.""  Bruce shrugged.  ""It keeps it from getting boring.""

""Why do you care who goes to the bathroom? That's weird.""  Trent said, looking confused.

""Well, Dad gets kind of pissed when people are doing drugs in the bathrooms.""  Bruce grinned.  ""You're so sheltered.""

""Shut up!  I am not!""  Trent shoved at Bruce's shoulder.  ""And you're so worldly it hurts.""

""More than you.""  Bruce pushed back.  ""Tell you what, next party I'll show you what to look for and you'll see that it's fun.""

""Fine, fine, fine.""  Trent leaned back, grabbing the papers off the floor.  ""Are you sure you don't want to finish my Latin?""

""Yeah, I'm sure.""  Bruce replied dryly.  ""I'll check it for you when you're done though.""

""Like I said, perfect.""  Trent made a kissy face at him.  ""You're an angel.""

""Fuck you.""  Bruce flipped him off again and Trent laughed.  ""I'm going to work on my lit paper.""  

""That's not due until next week.  Toss me my book, will you?""  Trent bit down on the end of a pen.  ""Holy shit, I did do this part in French.""

""Told you.""  Bruce tossed Trent his book.  ""Believe it or not, some of us don't like waiting until the last possible moment to do everything.""

""Says the person who finished his government paper by writing the last paragraph on my back in the hall right before class.""  Trent grinned at him.  ""Don't try to bullshit me, Wayne.  I know you.""

""Yeah, yeah, yeah.""  Bruce settled down at his desk.  ""I'll call Mom tomorrow about you staying for Christmas, okay?""

""Sounds great.""  Trent smiled a little. ""Thanks.""

""Hey, no problem.""  Bruce smiled back.  ""Now get back to sucking at Latin.""

""Oh fuck you, I have no room in my brain for this shit, it's too full of how much I rock at math.""  Trent said smugly.  


""Yeah, whatever, you still suck at Latin and I still rule.""  Bruce yanked a book down from the shelf, flipping through to find the right page.  

""Bite me."" Trent muttered, frowning in concentration.  Bruce watched him work for a few minutes, then turned back to his desk.  He couldn't keep from smiling though.  It was going to be awesome to have Trent staying over for Christmas.  He hated to admit it, but he was so used to having Trent there with him that he didn't sleep well when he went home now.  He'd have to figure out some way to convince his mom that Trent wouldn't need a separate room.  They could share his, no problem.  This was going to be the best Christmas ever.

"event","<lj-cut text=""The morning after.  Yeah.  Those happen."">

Jim yawned and stretched, enjoying the feeling of not having to tumble out of bed in the pitch black.  It wasn't so much that he minded doing it, not really.  But it was nice from time to time to enjoy the simple pleasure of not trying to throw his alarm clock against the wall.  He blinked a few times, finally giving a sigh and conceding that he was not getting back to sleep.  He rubbed his eyes, ran a hand through his hair and then pushed up.  Might as well see just how barren his cupboards were. 

""About time you woke up.""  Jim's head whipped towards the door.  ""I was beginning to get worried that I'd broken you.""

""Is that coffee?""  Jim pinched the bridge of his nose.  ""I mean, good morning.""  The bed dipped next to him and then a mug was waved under his nose.  The smell was amazing and Jim grabbed it without hesitation.

""Trust me, Jim, I understand the importance of coffee before anything else.""  Phil hooked an arm around Jim's waist and Jim leaned into him.  

""Mmm, man after my own heart.""  Jim took a long sip.  ""Okay, where did you get this?  There's no way this came out of my coffee pot.""  Jim took another deep drink, the warmth from the coffee spreading through him.

""Oh ye of little faith, I happen to be a maestro of coffee making.""  Phil grinned as Jim shot him a skeptical look.  ""Or I went spelunking through your cabinets and found some good stuff shoved in the back.""

""Christ, I forgot that stuff was even there.  I raided some of Christmas baskets from the station.  There's no point in using this stuff there, those heathens won't appreciate it.""  Jim turned slightly, brushing a kiss to the corner of Phil's mouth.  ""I didn't expect you to still be here.""

""I wasn't planning on sneaking out the door.""  Phil set his mug on the floor next to the bed, then ran a hand down Jim's chest.  ""Unless that's what you wanted?""

The hesitation was slight but Jim heard it loud and clear.  ""No, God, no, not at all.  I figured you'd need to get back to your place or the hospital or something.  I mean, it's got to be late.""  He squinted at the clock, trying to pick out the time.

""Believe it or not, most people don't consider seven in the morning to be late.  Especially not on a Sunday.""  Phil kissed Jim lightly.  ""I'm not on call until noon, I've got some time.""

""Good.""  Jim set his own mug down, then pulled Phil into his arms, laying them both back down on the bed.  ""I'm glad you're here then.  And not just for the coffee.""

""Oh, not just?""  Phil rested against Jim's chest. 

Jim waggled a hand back and forth.  ""It might be even.""  That got him the laugh he wanted and he grinned.  He couldn't remember the last time he felt this happy.  ""You're on call today?""

""Yeah, technically I'm supposed to be off all week but Rodriguez is off presenting a paper in Madrid so we're down a surgeon.  It's not so bad and I'm absolutely going to use this as leverage to get her to cover Thanksgiving.  Just once I'd like to make it through my own turkey dinner without rushing out to try to sew back on someone's hand.""  Phil looked up at Jim, a grin tugging the corners of his mouth.  ""You'd be amazed how many people can't use a carving knife.""

""You'd be stunned how many people can't get through Thanksgiving dinner without using the carving knife to stab a fellow family member.  I knew that I wasn't a rookie any more the first time I was at a crime scene like that and my first thought was damn too bad the blood's all over the pecan pie because that looks amazing.""  Phil laughed into his neck.  ""Seriously!  It was a damn waste!""

""It sounds like it.  I knew I wasn't a wet behind the ears intern any more when I realized I was eating a sandwich while looking through some pictures of a patient with flesh eating bacteria.""  Phil kissed the side of Jim's neck.  ""Pity to be so jaded.""

""Eh, it gets us through.""  Jim smoothed his palm down Phil's back.  ""Why did you choose trauma over anything else?""

""See, I knew you weren't listening last night.  Too busy thinking about how get in my pants.""  Phil attempted to sound put upon but the happy squirm he gave when Jim cupped his ass contradicted that.  

""No, last night you told me about how you got lured to Gotham and about setting up the trauma center and how you wanted to drown the review board.  For future reference, it's really not a good idea to reveal your plans for pre-meditated murder to a police officer.""  Jim shook his head.  ""I'd hate to have to be a material witness.""

""Hey, it's not like they would have found the bodies.""  Phil smirked.  ""There are advantages to having access to medical waste disposal facilities.""

""Oh, that's a lovely thought.""  Jim nudged Phil.  ""Seriously, why trauma, it sounds like you could have done anything.""

""I don't suppose you'll believe I'm an adrenaline junkie?""  Phil looked up at him, eyes wide.  

""Actually, I totally believe that.  But I also think that's not the reason why.  C'mon, Dr. Seymour, why?""  Jim pushed some hair out of Phil's eyes.  ""I'd like to know.""

Phil pushed up, looking down at Jim, his gaze intense.  ""You really do, don't you?""

""Yeah.""  Jim skimmed fingertips along his cheekbone.  ""I want to know all about you.""

Phil turned his head, kissing the inside of Jim's wrist.  ""I wanted to make a difference.  To save people.  Have you heard of the Golden Hour?""  Jim shook his head.  ""Ah.  Well, the theory behind it is that if someone is severely injured gets immediate medical care, the chances of survival and recovery are dramatically increased.  That's the whole point of the trauma center and the helicopters and all that.  If we can get people into a facility with the best equipment and the best medical personnel as fast as we can, then we can save people who wouldn't be saved otherwise.""  Phil shrugged.  ""I wanted to save people.  This is the best way to do it.""  He looked at Jim again, a slight smile on his lips.  ""I think you understand the whole messiah complex.""

That made Jim laugh softly.  ""I've never heard it put like that before.  But, I do get wanting to save people.""  Jim pulled Phil back down, rolling them onto their sides.  ""You know, I became a cop because I needed money for college and it seemed like the best option.  I never meant for it to become my life.""

""Really?  Because you sure seem to be the Platonic ideal of a cop.  Dedicated, brave, self-sacrificing, modest.""  Jim buried his face in Phil's neck, cheeks flaming.  ""Oh ho, someone can't take compliments, can they?  How about hot, sexy, stunning?""  Phil kissed him hard.  ""Sexy as fuck.""

""You said sexy.""  Jim muttered into Phil's mouth.  ""Losing your train of thought, doc?""

""You have that effect on me.""  Phil pushed Jim onto his back.  ""You know, we never did get around to round two last night.""

""No.  We didn't.""  Jim ran his hands up Phil's chest.  ""You have something in mind?""

Phil leaned down then whispered in his ear, ""I've wanted to fuck you blind ever since I saw you on television.  Do you know how difficult it is to explain why the news gives you a hard on?""

Jim gasped, arching up into Phil's touch.  ""Fuck.""

""That's a yes, right?  Because you have no idea, Jim, no idea how much I want you.""  Phil devoured his mouth and Jim let him.  It was freeing to give up control, to give in to someone else's desire.  To not worry about anything but pleasing his lover.  He finally wrenched his mouth free, gasping out ""Top drawer and so help me those condoms better not be expired.""

Phil dove for the drawer.  ""Not exactly been hitting the club then?""

""Not exactly.""  Jim bent over Phil, licking his way up his spine.  ""How about you, doc?""

""Jesus fuck it's hot when you call me that.""  Phil groaned.  Jim grinned and bit down on his shoulder.  ""Fuck.  No.  No, I haven't been with anyone in months and if you keep that up round two is going to be over before it starts.""

""Mmmm.""  Jim gave another nip to Phil's shoulder, then pulled back.  ""We wouldn't want that.""

""Hell, no, we wouldn't.""  Phil grabbed the box of condoms, rooting around for a moment before finding the lube.  ""Check the date.""

Jim grabbed the box.  ""Oh thank you God, we're good.""

""Yeah we are.""  Phil settled between Jim's legs.  ""Want me to go slow?  Since it's been awhile and all.""  He flipped open the lube, coating his fingers and Jim moaned at the sight.

""Not too slow.""  He lifted his hips.  ""I won't break.""

""Good to know."" Phil slowly began to work a finger into him and Jim's eyes fell closed, his head tipping back.  ""Now that's a good look on you.""

""Mmmm,"" Jim grabbed onto Phil's shoulder, pulling him down for a quick kiss.  ""I'll take your word for it.""  

""Good.""  Phil licked the shell of his ear.  ""I could get used to this.""

""Me too.""  Jim lifted his hips higher.  ""Of course I could get used to other things.""

""Pushy, pushy, pushy.""  Phil slid another finger in, working Jim open slowly.  ""Maybe I want to go slow.  Maybe I want to see you come undone.  Maybe I want to make you scream.""

""I don't think that's going to be a problem.""  Jim gasped, fingers digging into the sheets.  ""And maybe I'm going to lose it before you fuck me, Jesus."" Jim reached out, grabbed the box and managed to work a condom free.  He ripped it open then grinned.  ""I'll do the favors.""

""Be my guest.""  Phil's voice sounded a bit strangled.  ""Now would be good.""  

""Yeah.""  Jim slowly rolled the condom down Phil's erection, fingers sliding down to stroke over his balls.  That got him a muffled groan and Jim smirked.  ""I'm ready when you are.""  

""Good.""  Phil lifted Jim's legs, looping them over his shoulders before sliding in slowly.  ""Fucking hell.""

Jim nodded, biting down hard on his lower lip.  ""That's.  Fuck.  That.""  Phil groaned something, maybe his name, maybe a curse, Jim couldn't tell.  He slid out then back in and Jim tasted blood as bit through his lip to keep from screaming.  ""Jesus.  Harder.""

""You've got it.""  Phil thrust into him faster and Jim let out a deep moan.  He got lost in the feel of Phil moving in him and the sound of Phil's body against his.  He reached down, stroking his own erection in time to the thrusts.  It was good, so damn good and fuck it was always too long between times he did this.  His back arched up when he came, a scream pulled from him almost against his will.  He couldn't have stopped it though, even if he tried.  It was too good, too strong.  Jim opened his eyes just in time to see Phil's head tip back.  Seeing him like this was even better than the night before.

""Jim.""  Phil's voice was hoarse as he collapsed onto Jim.  Jim wrapped his arms around him, breathing hard.  He nosed through Phil's hair, trying to slow down his heart rate.

""That went well.""  Jim kissed Phil's forehead.  

""I'd say yes.""  Phil pushed up onto his elbows.  ""I think we can get better with practice though.""  He pulled out slowly.  ""Trash can?""  

Jim nodded to the corner, wiping his chest off with the sheet while Phil disposed of the condom.  ""I think we need to shower.""

""Yeah.""  Phil sprawled on his back on the bed.  ""We do.  I also think I need way more coffee.  And food.  Food would be good.""

Jim's stomach rumbled at that and he poked Phil in the side with his foot.  ""You had to mention food, didn't you?""

""Well I could say something about eating in and best sources of protein but I'm above such petty comments.""  Phil laughed when the pillow hit him in the face.  ""What!  I didn't say it!""

""Sure you didn't.""  Jim pushed off the bed, holding out a hand to Phil.  ""C'mon, doc, let's get you cleaned up so we can go eat.""

""Sounds like a plan to me.""  Phil took Jim's hand, letting Jim pull him up.  ""I want waffles.  And bacon.  And sausage.  And more bacon.""

""That sounds nutritious.""  Jim pulled Phil into the bathroom, turning on the hot water.  ""The one great thing about this place?  Huge hot water heaters.""

""Nice.  And we're going to need our strength.""  Phil palmed Jim's ass.  ""I've only got about three more hours until I should go and that's not nearly enough time for what I plan on doing to you.""

Jim tugged at the collar of his shirt.  ""Seriously, was this really necessary?""  He glanced over at Martha.  ""I thought you said it was going to be a small party.""

""You neglected to ask if our definitions of small were the same.  For God's sake, stop fussing, you're worse than Bruce.""  Martha reached out and fixed his bow tie.  ""You look great, it's your birthday, you got a promotion, there's steak, whiskey and cake.  Stop looking like you're going to be executed and pretend to have a good time, Lieutenant.""

Jim couldn't stop the smile at that.  ""Fine, fine, but only to please my lovely hostess.""  He offered his arm.  ""May I have the pleasure of escorting you in?""

""Oh the pleasure's mine.""  She grinned at him.  ""I won a hundred bucks off Thomas that you'd actually wear a tux.""

""He bet against you?  Why on earth would he do that?""  He took a deep breath, hesitating at the door to the ballroom.  ""How do you do this so often?""

""I think about how great it will be when it's over.""  She squeezed his hand.  ""Jim, seriously, I want you to enjoy yourself.  I know this isn't what you would have wanted for a party but it's going to get you enormous good will.""  Her smile turned a bit feral.  ""Besides, I do think some people need to be reminded who your friends are.  Mess with you, mess with me.""

""You know, once upon a time when I saw the pictures in the tabloids I thought these parties were hotbeds of decadence, not palace intrigue worthy of the Borgias.""  He took another fortifying breath.  ""Shall we?""

""Sorry to strip away your innocence. And we shall.  Remember, smile, head high and concentrate on the fact that it will all be over soon.""  She pushed on the door and they walked in.  Jim tried not to flinch at the shouts of happy birthday and the flash of the cameras.

""Whatever it is, it can't be that bad.""  Jim turned his head, taking in the man who suddenly appeared next to him.  Tall, blond, green eyes, nice smile. 

""I beg your pardon?""  Jim tried to place the face but was coming up blank.  He desperately hoped this wasn't some member of the city council that he was supposed to be sucking up to.  

""You look someone kicked your dog.  Here.""  The man held out a glass and Jim looked at it for a second before taking it.  The man laughed.  ""Come on, you can't be afraid someone would poison you here?""

""No, no,"" Jim took the drink.  ""I'm sorry, I appear to have left my manners in my other suit.""  That got him a delighted laugh and Jim felt warmth curl through him.  ""Thanks.""

""No problem.  I'm Phil by the way.""  He held out his hand and Jim shook it. The man held on a bit longer than necessary.  ""It's nice to meet you.""

""I'm Jim and good to meet you too.""  Jim reluctantly let go.  Phil's grip was sure and his hand was warm and hell if it didn't feel good. 

""Oh, I know who you are, Lieutenant Gordon.""  The man took a sip of his own drink.  ""Happy birthday and congrats on the promotion.""

""Thanks.""  Jim eyed him over the rim of his glass, trying not to be obvious about it.  ""So, are you friends of the Waynes?""

Phil opened his mouth to answer when Thomas came up next to him and threw his arm around Phil's shoulder.  ""Ah, I see you've met.  Excellent.""

""Well, that answers that question.  I work with Thomas.""  Phil jabbed an elbow into Thomas' side.  ""Hey, since you were doing such a lousy job at introducing your guests to the guest of honor I had to take matters into my own hands.""

""Fine, fine, Lieutenant James Gordon, super cop, may I present Dr. Philip Seymour, trauma surgeon extraordinaire.  Phil, Jim, Jim, Phil.""  Thomas pushed Phil towards Jim.  ""You two play nice.""  He smirked at them and then headed off, giving Jim a thumbs up on the way. 

""Well, that was subtle.""  Phil shook his head sadly.  ""So, should I continue pretending that I was coming over to say happy birthday and to add my word of thanks for keeping Gotham safe or should I cut straight to the part where I've been bugging the hell out of Thomas to introduce me to his hot cop friend for weeks?""

Jim choked on his drink.  ""What?""

Phil pounded him on the back while Jim spluttered.  ""Sorry, sorry, believe it or not I didn't time that.""  Jim shot him a look and the corner of Phil's mouth twitched up.  ""Not entirely.""

""That's good to know.""  Jim wiped the back of his mouth on his hand.  ""I.  I really don't know what to say.""

""How about, it's great to meet you and I can't wait until this party is over so we can go get coffee and get to know each other better?""  Phil sounded hopeful.  ""Honestly, I've been after Thomas to introduce us ever since I saw you at that press conference.  You really put that reporter in his place.""

""Thanks.""  Jim finished his drink.  ""You're a trauma surgeon?  That must be stressful.""

""Eh, it has its moments.""  Phil stepped in a bit closer.  ""Seriously, come out for coffee with me as soon as you can get away.  I'd suggest leaving now but I don't think it would be too polite for the guest of honor to bail on his own party.""

Jim looked at Phil for a moment, considering all the reasons why he should say no.  It would be foolish to do that, not now, not when his face was still in the papers and his career was going to be under even closer scrutiny.  So he was lonely and he couldn't remember the last time anyone looked at him with the frank admiration that Phil was showing.  He wasn't a teenager.  He wasn't ruled by hormones.  He should say no and nice to meet you and I have to get back to the party.  That's what he should do.  ""You know what?  I think one of the perks to being the guest of honor is doing what you want.  And what I want,"" he looked Phil up and down, delighted by the flush that brought to Phil's cheeks, ""is to get that coffee now.""

""Excellent!  I'll,"" Phil licked his lips and Jim caught himself swaying forward a bit.  ""I'll meet you out there then?""  He pointed to the doors leading to the side patio and Jim nodded.  

""I'll meet you there in a moment.""  He headed off to say his goodbyes to Thomas and Martha.  He might regret this in the morning but what the hell.  It was his birthday.  Might was well give himself a present.

"event","Sorry it's been so long since I've posted more.  I really have no excuse other than sheer laziness.  And.  Here.  We.  Go.  (oh come ON I had to do that)

<lj-cut come=""come"" in=""in"" many=""many"" different=""different"">

""Drop your weapon!  Drop your weapon now or we will shoot!""  Jim kept his eyes fixed determinedly on the face of the man in front of him.  ""Do it now!""  He watched the emotions flicker across the man's face, anger, sadness, confusion and then finally rage.  Pure, murderous rage.  The man lifted his arm and Jim didn't hesitate.   He pulled the trigger twice, part of him grimly satisfied when the man dropped to the ground, blood spilling down his chest.  He heard the screams around him, watching as Stephens kicked the knife away and then kneeled down, checking the man's pulse.

""He's gone.""  Stephens shoved to his feet.  ""Good shooting.""

Jim nodded a silent thanks and then went over to where the woman was bound to the chair.  He was grateful that her eyes were covered with a thick layer of duct tape.  There was no need for her to see that, not after everything else.  He knelt next to her, careful to keep his voice calm and low.  ""I'm Sergeant Jim Gordon and I'm with Gotham PD.  We're here to get you.  I'm going to take the tape off your eyes and mouth now, I'm sorry, it's probably going to hurt.  Are you ready?""  She gave a jerky nod and Jim reached up.  ""Here we go.""  He pulled the tape away from her eyes first, locking his gaze on hers before pulling the tape off her mouth.  

""Thank you, oh my God, thank you, thank you, thank you.""  She tried to lean into him but was stopped by the rope around her chest.  ""Is he dead?  I heard shots, did you kill him, oh God, there's at least one other person here, I heard her screaming last night, oh God, get me out of here, please, please, please.""

""We'll get you free in just a second, miss, try to breathe.""  Jim shoved to his feet, stepping aside to let someone start working to get the ropes free.  ""You said you heard someone else screaming?""  She nodded again and Jim looked over at Stephens.  ""Okay.  I'll go right, you go left.""  Stephens headed off, Jim a few steps behind.  He wished he'd thought to bring a flashlight.  The house was dark and grim, the windows boarded up with only a few lamps in the living room giving light.  He started up the stairs, careful to stay close to the wall.  As best they knew, that monster was working alone.  Jim knew better than to make that assumption.  The last thing he needed was someone suddenly appearing out of the shadows.  He checked the room at the top of the stairs, trying not to gag when he saw the jars lining the walls.  The only solace he could find was at least they'd be able to identify the victims.  He checked the bathroom next, finding nothing other than some razors that he was sure would yield evidence.  Not that there was going to be a trial now but it would still help to close the case.  He finally reached the last door and he pushed it open carefully.  He stood in the doorway, hand falling to his side.  The blood was still dripping onto the floor from the slash across her throat.  She couldn't have been dead more than twenty minutes, a half an hour at the most.  He was still standing there when he heard Stephens call up the stairs.  He was still standing there when he felt Stephens' hand clasp his shoulder.

""Jim.  You did everything you could.  You did.""  Stephens pulled his hand back and Jim immediately missed the warmth of the touch.  ""I saw the other bedroom.  You should have shot him in the gut.""

That startled a snort out of Jim.  ""You'd best keep that opinion to yourself.""  

""Like everyone won't think the same.""  Jim heard the sound of Stephens holstering his weapon.  ""Come on, you've got to call the Commissioner and tell him that you caught the bastard.""

Jim groaned, reaching under his glasses to rub his eyes.  ""Fuck.  I don't suppose I can get you to do it?""

""Nope.  The perks of being any underling.  Come on, the faster you do that, the faster we can get the fuck out of this piece of Hell.""  Stephens tugged on his arm and Jim let him guide him out.  ""That girl downstairs thinks you're an avenging angel.  Gotta say, she makes a good case.""

Jim let himself into his apartment, the hinge sounding even creakier than usual.  He was going to have to fix that.  At some point.  Hell, maybe at some point in the week he had off now so that IA could go through the shooting with a fine tooth comb and find out exactly how he fucked it up.  God forbid that anyone get the impression that he'd done the right thing by taking out that piece of shit.  Oh no.  No, those jackals were going to second guess him under the guise of a ""routine inquiry, Jim, you know the procedure"".  Hell, there were already rumors starting that the second girl's family, Tabitha, that was it, her name was Tabitha, was going to sue because if only they'd gone in an hour earlier when the patrol first got to the house instead of waiting for backup she would still be alive.  Jim shrugged out of his jacket, resisting the urge to throw it across the room.  He took off his shoulder holster, putting his gun in the safe out of habit.  He flopped down on the couch.  It was too much effort to go all the way to the bedroom.  He'd survive a night on the couch.  

He wasn't sure how long he'd been there when the sound of the phone cut through the haze.  He snagged his phone, trying to keep the exhaustion out of his voice ""Gordon.""  He desperately hoped it wasn't MCU calling him to come back.

""Jim, hey, it's Thomas, I heard you got that bastard.  How are you?""  The open worry in Thomas' voice caused a lump to rise to Jim's throat.

""I'm.  Exhausted.  Do I even want to ask who told you?""  Jim stretched out, draping an arm over his face.

""Jim, this is the lead story on everything, GNN, CNN, you name it, it's out there.  From the Mayor's press conference, it sounds like you parted the seas and turned water into wine.""  Thomas paused.  ""I also heard that he came at you with a knife.""

""Yeah.  I didn't really want to add being stabbed to being shot.""  Jim flinched at how hostile he sounded.  ""Sorry.  It's been a long night.""

""I bet.""  There was another pause and Jim fought to stay awake.  ""I'm calling Gary.  I don't want you talking to anyone else without him there.""

""Jesus, you think it's going to be that bad that I need a lawyer?""  That caused Jim to bolt up.  ""It was a clean shoot!""

""You don't have to convince me of that but, well, I've heard some things about Ramirez that I don't like.  Let's just say that she's still furious with you for refusing to let her into MCU.  Look, I'm being paranoid, I admit it, but humor me.""

""Fine.  Okay, fine.""  Jim sighed.  ""How long until the press decides it's more interesting to blame me for not saving them both?""

""They're not going to do that.""  Thomas' voice was firm.  ""From what everyone's said it was a miracle you figured it out.""

""It wasn't just me.  No, don't start, it wasn't.  I may have had the break but it took everyone to get there.""  Jim sighed again.  ""I hate being made the hero.""

""Then next time try not being the hero.  Just a thought.  You have to see the montage that GNN put together of your, what did they call it, inspiring life.  I don't know how they did it but they got a shot of you playing with an orphan and a puppy at the same time.""  Now Thomas sounded gleeful and Jim entertained a brief fantasy of strangling him with a stethoscope.  ""It's fantastic, I'm going to order copies to play for your birthday.  Christmas.  Arbor Day.""

""I hate you, I hope you know that.""  Jim couldn't suppress a chuckle though.  ""I was feeling really sorry for myself before you called.  Bastard.""

""Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell you what, I'll make it up to you by sending Alfred over with that soup you love.  Also, booze.  And I'll tell Gary to hold off calling you until the morning okay?  Hey, consider it insurance, if there's any attempt to fuck you over, he'll stop it in its tracks.  Martha wants you to come over tomorrow since you're free.  Be prepared, I think she's plotting something.  Oh, hold on a sec.""  Thomas' voice grew muffled and Jim yawned.  ""Sorry, I've got to go.  I can tell Martha you're coming over?""

""Do I have a choice?""  The laugh he got in response answered that.  ""Go, I'll talk to you later.""  He hung up and then shoved to his feet, heading for the shower.  He figured he had twenty minutes or so before Alfred go there and he would be damned if Alfred saw him when he was such a mess.

Jim pushed the report to the other side of his deck, rubbing at his eyes.  As much as he hated to admit it, he needed glasses.  It was bad enough getting a headache from stress and lack of sleep and too much caffeine and squinting to try to read the reports.  Adding eye strain to it was asking a bit much.  He reached out, snagging his mug and downing a mouthful of coffee.  Sadly, the station's coffee was better cold.  He tipped his head back, closing his eyes and letting his mind drift.  There was something there, something just out of his reach.  There'd been a huge spike in drug related crime over the last six months.  This wasn't the normal turf wars, those he had a handle on.  This was something different.  It was almost as if someone was testing both the police department and the mob to see how they reacted to incursions on their turf.  If that was the case?  That story wasn't going to end well.  Gotham was well able to create her own monsters, thank you very much.  Outside help need not apply.

He spun his chair back and forth, trying to find a new angle.  Okay, they'd tried running through the distribution channels but those all ended in the same spot.  A body in the river, or on the docks, or dumped in the street. A body with one perfect bullet hole in the center of the forehead.  He was still waiting on forensics results from the last three loads of cocaine they'd gotten in the raids.  There was another problem.  The raids were almost too clean.  In and out and the bad guys captured and the drugs confiscated and Mayor Paulson and Commissioner Wallace standing there pontificating about how Gotham's streets would soon be clear of the menace of drugs.  It was picture perfect.  Jim had learned a long time ago to never trust anything that looked that perfect.  Nothing was ever that simple.  Not to mention that drug dealers weren't that stupid.  Sure, the street level dealers would get caught with their wares most of the time.  But these weren't street thugs.  These were major shipments that should have had major security.  There absolutely should have been orders in place to destroy the evidence.  But no.  Instead there were almost perfunctory attempts to fight back.  Something was going on that was making the hair on the back of Jim's neck stand up.  If only he could figure out what that was.

The phone rang, jolting him out of his daze.  ""MCU, Gordon speaking.""  

""Hey, Jim, are we still on for dinner tonight?""  Thomas sounded slightly amused and Jim blinked, trying to figure out what he could have said that was funny.

""Yeah, of course, you still want to go to that diner?  I should warn you, I might run a little late, things are really hectic here.""  Jim spun a pen around.  He fought down the twinge of guilt at the thought of leaving the office.  Surely the city wouldn't explode if he ran out for something to eat.

""If by running a little late, you mean almost an hour, then, yeah, I kind of noticed that.""  Now Thomas was definitely amused and Jim's head snapped up.

""Holy shit, it cannot possibly be eight.""  The last he'd checked, it was only around three.

""Holy shit, you lost track of time.  Again.  Get your ass out of there, Jim.  MCU will survive while you grab a burger.  Doctor's orders.""  Thomas said.

""If you put it that way.  Be there in ten.""  He hung up and snagged his jacket, tugging it on as he headed out the door.  He'd grab a bite and then head back, maybe some fresh air would give him a new perspective.

Thomas downed the last of his fries and then gave Jim's plate a pointed look.  ""I think I can assure you that this diet you appear to be on isn't necessary.""

Jim sighed, then stuffed the last bite of his sandwich into his mouth.  ""There, happy now?""  He wiped his mouth, then rested his elbows on the table, leaning wearily on his hands.  ""Just not that hungry lately, I guess.""

""Things that bad?""  Thomas sipped at his coffee.

Jim grimaced.  ""Yes and no.  I've got a bad feeling about some things that are going on but nothing concrete.""

""You'll work it out.  How's the new department working out?""  Thomas reached over, stealing the rest of his fries.  Jim arched a brow and Thomas smirked at him.  ""I was on my feet all day.  Growing boy and all that.""

""Stealing Bruce's lines, now?  That's sad.""  Jim sipped his own coffee, luxuriating in the taste.  This place might be a dive but, damn, the coffee was good.  ""So far it's going better than I thought.  We're still working out some jurisdictional issues and not everyone is thrilled that we're getting priority at the lab but that was to be expected.  I'd be happier if we had about ten more people.""  He paused, thinking that over.  ""Actually, I'd be happier if there wasn't the case load to need ten more people.""

Thomas lifted his coffee cup and clinked it against Jim's.  ""I know exactly what you mean.  I remember doing my ER rotation and complaining when it was slow and then realizing that was actually a good thing.""

""Exactly.""  They sipped their coffee in silence for a few minutes then Jim looked at his watch.

""Jim, how long were you there today?  Twelve hours?  Fourteen?  You need to get some sleep.""  Thomas held up a hand to stop Jim's protests.  ""Hey, take it from someone who knows, at a certain point you're not effective without some rest.  Gotham will still be here in the morning.""

""I'll give you this, at least you didn't play the I'll tell Martha you look like shit card.""  Jim replied, sighing heavily.  ""I need this to succeed, Thomas.""

""And it will.  Just don't destroy yourself making sure it does.  Besides, I'm going to let Martha tell you that herself on Friday night.""  Thomas pointed at him.  ""You are coming to the party and you will pretend to have a decent time and you will not hide under the back staircase without me again.""

""God, is the party this Friday?  Really?  What's this for again?""  Jim fished his coffee, resting his head against the back of the booth.  ""The orphanage or the Boys & Girls Club?""

""It's for the camp program and basically all of the city board will be there so you'll have a lovely opportunity to lobby for funding for expansions to the lab.""  Thomas grinned.  ""You're very sneaky at that.  No one ever expects it coming from you.""

""I blame Martha.  And Alfred.  Not to mention you.""  Jim pointed at him.  ""You've all corrupted me terribly.""

Thomas laughed and Jim smiled a little.  ""Guilty as charged. Seriously, though, you have to come, Bruce misses you.  You haven't been up to the Manor in, what, a month?  More?""

Jim considered that.  ""God, at least.  How's he doing, getting ready to start school?""

""That he is.  Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.  We're thinking of sending him to Gotham Prep this year.""  Thomas waved a hand and the waitress brought over more coffee.  

""Isn't that where he's going now?""  Jim asked, a bit confused. 

""Yes, but we're thinking of having him stay there as a boarding student.  He hasn't said anything, but we're worried that he's getting too isolated.  The Manor isn't exactly in a family neighborhood.  Besides, it'll be easier to get ready for him going to college if he's not there during the week.  We figure he'll stay there during the week and then come home on the weekends.""   Thomas took a sip.  ""He's thirteen now, Jim, and his only friends are you, Alfred and Trent.  That's not good.""

""I never thought about that.""  Jim smiled slightly.  ""He's never really acted much like a child.  Pranks notwithstanding.""

Thomas laughed.  ""Alfred will be plotting revenge for the snake thing for years.  I warned Bruce that he has a long memory.  So what do you think?""

""Well, with all my parenting experience,"" Jim said dryly, ""I think it sounds like a good idea.  He can always come home if it doesn't work out.""

""Exactly, besides, Trent boards and the two of them are thick as thieves.  I fear for the future when their plans for world domination come true.  Though apparently Bruce plans on being a benevolent overlord.""  Thomas grinned around his cup.  ""I told him I was going to vote for Kang.""

Jim laughed, maybe a little harder than the joke warranted but it had been a long day.  Week.  Hell, month.  ""That's good I'm going to remember that.""

""I blame you for corrupting my taste.""  Thomas finished off his coffee.  ""So,"" he said casually and Jim sat up.  He knew that tone and he knew enough be wary.  ""Should I be telling Martha that you're bringing a guest?""

""Not this again.  Even if I was seeing someone, which I'm not, I'm not bringing said someone to one of your parties.  That's a disaster just waiting to happen.""  Jim leaned forward, lowering his voice.  ""I know you both mean well but this interest in my love life is a bit creepy.""

Thomas leaned forward as well.  ""No, it's what meddlesome old married couples do for fun.  Just wait, some day you'll be the one trying to match people up.  I take it things with Steve didn't work out?""

Jim pinched the bridge of his nose.  ""Why do I even bother trying to stop the two of you?  I wouldn't say things didn't work out, but, I told you, it was never serious in the first place.  I haven't seen him in at least a month and I'm pretty sure that he was going to try to get back with his ex.  It's fine, I hope it works out for him.""

""Hey, forgive me for wanting to see you happy.""  Thomas glanced at his watch.  ""We should both get going, it's late, even by your standards.""

Jim nodded, tossing some money on the table.  ""I'll be there Friday, if nothing comes up.  And, yes, I'm going to get home to sleep.  You're a terrible influence, you know that?""

Thomas pushed up, chuckling.  ""Yes, making you work only fourteen hours, I'm awful.""  

Jim bumped his shoulder ""You are.  Say hey to Bruce for me.""  Thomas nodded.  Jim watched him walk out the door then yawned widely.  He'd head right home.  Right after he stopped back at the station to grab those files.

<lj-cut text=""In which there is yet more party, Bruce continues to be a ninja and I made myself hungry reading over this."">

Bruce craned his neck, trying to look through the crowd to find Jim.  The party was as loud and boring as most of his parents' parties and he thought that he'd been really good about standing there and smiling at people and shaking the Mayor's hand and not rolling his eyes when the Mayor talked to him like he was an idiot.  Well.  He'd been good about it once Alfred found them in the pantry.  It was totally Trent's fault they'd been caught, Bruce told him that the floor squeaked there.  So if he had to be out here with everyone, at least he should get to talk to Jim.  

He slipped through the crowd, dodging the head pats and shoulder squeezes.  It was fine when his mother got a bit clingy when they were alone.  He wouldn't admit it, but he needed it too.  It might have been over a month since That Night but he could still see everything when he closed his eyes.  He knew that he'd never forget it.  He finally saw Jim over by the wall, leaning against it and looking tired.  Bruce hesitated for a moment.  Maybe he should get his father or Alfred.  He knew that the party must be really tiring for Jim.  It was tiring for his parents and they had these all the time.  Jim wasn't used to it and he hadn't been going out of the apartment that much yet and maybe he should go rest.  Bruce looked over again and Jim caught his eye.  Jim smiled and sketched a little wave and Bruce couldn't stop himself from walking over.

""Hi, Sergeant Gordon.""  Bruce moved to stand next to him.  ""Are you having fun?""

""I thought we agreed you could call me Jim.   And, oh yes, I'm having a wonderful time.""  Jim ruffled his hair a little.

""We're in public.""  Bruce replied.  ""It's important to show appropriate respect.""  He tried to keep from laughing as long as he could.

""Yes, I know that you're all about showing me respect.""  Jim sounded remarkably like Alfred, which was a terrifying thought.  ""So, I hear that you have a great hiding place that you neglected to tell me about.""

""It wasn't that great since Alfred found us.""  Bruce said under his breath.  

Jim snorted.  ""I hate to break it to you, Bruce, but you're never going to outwit Alfred.  It's best to give up now.""  

""That's what Dad says too.""  Bruce looked up at Jim.  ""You look like you're not having fun.""

""Well, these things aren't necessarily about having fun, you know.  Sometimes you have to do things that you really don't want to do because it's important to other people that you do them.  It's called being an adult.  I strongly advise that you find a way to avoid becoming one if you can.""  Jim sounded solemn but the corner of his mouth was curled up in a tiny smile.  ""Hey, where's Trent?  The two of you are usually joined at the hip.""

""He's off trying to get more of those bacon roll things.  Alfred says he won't give me any more.""  Bruce scowled in the direction he'd last seen Trent.  ""Traitor.""

That made Jim laugh out loud.  ""Hey, if you play your cards right, you can get Trent to give them to you.  That way technically you didn't get them from Alfred so you aren't violating what he told you.""  

Bruce considered this.  ""You're right, he said that he wouldn't give me more, he didn't say I couldn't have more.""  

Jim nodded.  ""Exactly.  So go find Trent, get some of those bacon things and then bring some back here.""

""Okay, I'll do that.""  Bruce beamed up at Jim.  ""Are you still coming over tomorrow?  I wanted to show you that engine I'm working on.""

""The one in that disaster area you're calling a lab?  You're going to blow us all up, you know.""  Jim gave him a little push.  ""Of course I'll be over.  Now go fetch me sustenance, young padawan.""

Bruce laughed.  ""Yes, Obi Wan.""  He spotted Trent across the room and headed over.  Trent had that smirk that said he thought he'd gotten away with something that Bruce couldn't.  Fine.  Let Trent think that for now.  He'd see who had the last laugh when Jim ate the last roll.  Bruce looked back at Jim.  He hoped that Jim could come over, he'd been working hard on the engine and he really wanted to show it off.

<lj-cut text=""Perfect Timing - part 2"">

""Alfred?""  Bruce tried to keep his voice steady, but it was hard, so hard to do that when he was cold and afraid and his dad was in surgery and his mom was off trying to track down someone to tell her who would come to be with the officer.  ""Alfred, is the policeman going to be okay?""

Alfred reached down, squeezing his shoulder lightly ""I'm certain that your father is doing his very best to make sure that's the case, Master Bruce.""  Alfred looked him over, then tugged Bruce's jacket around him tightly.  ""We should be getting you home, it's high time you were in bed.""

""No!""  Bruce swallowed hard, then started again, trying not to sound desperate.  ""I want to stay, I want to know he's fine, I know.""  Bruce took a deep breath then finished softly.  ""It's my fault.""

""What's your fault?""  His mother sat down next to him, her arm curling around him protectively.  He leaned into her, hungry for the warmth.  

""It's my fault he got shot.""  Bruce said, the words barely a whisper.  ""It's my fault.""

""Bruce, you listen to me.""  His mother turned him so that he was looking right at her and it was all he could do not to close his eyes and try to hide.  ""The only person who's at fault is the man who shot him and he wasn't in his right mind.  This isn't your fault, not at all.""

""But, but, if I hadn't gotten scared and if I hadn't made us go,"" Bruce started.  He bit his lip, trying to stay calm.  ""It's my fault.""

""And if your father decided to drive or have Alfred drive us then we would have gone out the front and if we hadn't checked our coats then we would have left sooner and not been there when that man was and if we had gone left instead of right then we wouldn't have been there at all.""  She tucked some hair behind Bruce's ear.   ""Things happen that we can't control, Bruce.  That's all.""

Bruce nodded, trying his best to believe that.  He snuggled in closer to his mother's side, eyes drifting shut as he listened to his mother talk to Alfred.

""Were you able to get in touch with his family?  I spoke with the pilot and there's a plane waiting to fetch them.""  Alfred said.

""No.""  His mother sighed.  ""I spoke with the commissioner and the head of Officer Gordon's department and with someone from the union and they all told me that he never really spoke about his family.  Someone was looking up his emergency contact information but apparently that information can't be given out.""

""Ah.  Well, leave that to me then.  I shall be just a few moments.""  Bruce heard Alfred's footsteps heading away and he let himself drift.  Alfred would fix this.  Alfred always did.

It seemed like only a few minutes later that he heard his father's voice.  He cracked his eyes open, seeing his father standing across the room, still in his surgical scrubs.  They were bloody and Bruce felt a sudden rush of panic.  No.  No.  It couldn't be.  He couldn't have gotten someone killed. His father must have fixed it, his father could fix anything, he would and he did and this wasn't real, it was a nightmare, it had to be a nightmare, he had to wake up.

""It's going to be a few days before we know the extent of the damage but it looks like he should have full use of his knee.  The bigger problem was the blood loss, it was just damn bad luck that the bullet ricocheted how it did.  I'm hopeful that we got him here fast enough that necrosis won't be an issue.""  Bruce saw his father rub at the back of his neck the way he did when he was really tired.  ""We were lucky, Martha.""

""If he hadn't been there, Thomas.""  Her voice trailed off for a moment.  ""Well, he was and I will never forget it.""  

""Neither will I.  How's Bruce doing?""  Bruce shut his eyes as his father walked over, not wanting to get caught eavesdropping.

""He thinks it's his fault."" He felt his father's fingers combing through his hair and he was tempted to sit up.  He didn't though.  He'd figured out awhile ago that the best way to listen to adults was to pretend to be asleep.

""That's"" there was a pause and then a long sigh ""Completely understandable, actually.   I feel the same way.""  

""Thomas, don't be ridiculous, you know as well as I do that's not true.""  He could hear his mother reach out and take his father's hand.  ""It was simply the wrong place at the wrong time.""

""I know, you're right.""  Another sigh.  ""When is his family getting here?""

""They're not.""  That nearly made Bruce bolt up.  His mother only used that tone of voice when she was furious and not bothering to hide it.

""What?  How can they not want to be here?  They know that we'll take care of all of the arrangements and expenses, of course.""  Now his father sounded confused and Bruce was too.  He could not begin to imagine his parents not being there if he was hurt, let alone shot.  ""Did Alfred not track them down?""

That made his mother snort and Bruce smothered a grin into the jacket he was using as a pillow.  As if there was anything Alfred couldn't discover.  ""No, he got the information, of course.  But when I called them.""  Another long pause.  ""I spoke to his father first.  When I said I was calling about his son he said he didn't have a son and hung up.  I called back and his mother answered and I told her what happened and offered to get them here and she told me,"" his mother's voice caught and Bruce felt a surge of anger.  No one should make his mother mad.  ""She told me thank you very much for calling but that Jim died to them when he left.  I don't understand that, how can any parent do that?""

""I don't know but we'll make sure that he has support.""  His father had that determined note to his voice that Bruce knew so well.  It was the tone he got when Bruce didn't want to study Latin or work through equations.  

""Absolutely.""  His mother knelt down and Bruce stirred a little.  ""Now if someone is done listening to things that he's not supposed to hear, then it's time that someone went home.""

Bruce smiled up at her, trying to give his best innocent look.  ""I just woke up.""  

His dad snorted ""Sure you did.  Come on, Bruce, its way too late for you to be out.""

""I want to see the officer.""  Bruce gave his father the biggest pleading eyes he could.  His father was always a softer touch.  

""You can see Officer Gordon tomorrow, Bruce.  Now it's time you got some real sleep.""  The firm voice was back and Bruce gave in.  No use in fighting and not getting to come back.  

""Officer Gordon is going to be fine, right?""  He was pretty sure that's what he heard but he needed to know.

""Yes, he will.""  Bruce nodded and let his mother herd him off to where Alfred was waiting to take him home.

"event","This, this is the fault of <lj user=""robanybody""> who is massively feeding into my love of Hawaii Five-0 and since she gave me Chin/Danny (which is awesome and go read it right now shoo), I, in turn, give her this.  No redeeming value.  Language.  Boytouching.  You know, the good stuff.

<lj-cut text=""Tequila makes your clothes fall off"">

Danny's got to be honest, he really doesn't remember how he's ended up in this position.  He does remember starting the day out going out on what they all thought was going to be a run of the mill drug ring take down and that ended up somehow involving the NSA and ICE and the DEA and some other agencies he doesn't even want to know exist and he blames Steve for it, he totally does, it was all Steve's fault that what should have been a nice and calm little drug bust turned into World War III.  Also?  Just for the record?  He has never been shot at so much as he has now that he's moved to paradise and he pulled nearly four years on the Newark gang task force so that's saying something.

He remembers the gunfire and the moment of blind terror when Kono and Chin disappeared behind a wall of flame when some stray bullets hit the gas tanks at the back of the warehouse.  He distinctly remembers screaming ""get the FUCK DOWN"" at Steve when he went charging into the middle of bullets like he either thought he was bulletproof or he didn't care if he lived or died and, yeah, they were going to have a lovely little chat/screaming match about that tomorrow, see if they didn't.  He truly remembers the feeling of his fist smashing into the face of the guy who was trying to take him away from his baby girl.  He remembers all of that quite well.

What he doesn't remember is how he ended up sitting in this bar with Steve sitting next to him actually fucking laughing, laughing like he's a normal fucking guy, while Chin is busy simultaneously flirting with the entire bar and warning everyone off Kono.  He wishes he could remember when Kono got the chance to change into that skirt and top that she's wearing but, then again, maybe not because he's pretty sure that Chin can and will kill him and dump him into a volcano for noticing just how smooth that strip of skin across the small of Kono's back is.  

He also wishes he could remember exactly how many shots of tequila he's had.  However many it is, it's the exactly right number to make him forget that he wants to use his hands to strangle Steve, not to run them all over that chest and those abs and that ass and yeah.  He tosses back another shot, watching as Steve does the same.  He watches Steve's throat work as he swallows and he's truly thankful that the flush he knows is spreading across his cheeks and down his own throat will be chalked up to the alcohol and the heat and the fact that he is still wearing his fucking tie for some reason that escapes him now.

He's so caught up in trying to stare at Steve without being busted that he's totally shocked when Steve throws an arm around his shoulder and leans heavily into his side.  ""I told you Danno, I fucking told you that this was a good idea.""  Steve's beaming at him, fucking smile splitting his face and he's leaning in to taste that smile before his mind catches up to what a disaster that would be.  He just manages to catch himself in time to make it look like it's drunken swaying and not the urge to drag Steve under the table and have his way with him.

""Hey, you know that even a blind squirrel can sometimes find a nut.""  Yeah, okay, it's not his finest retort but, hey, he's working impaired here in more ways than one.  Steve just laughs harder, leaning into him more and, yeah, okay he'll admit they've been taking the fight option over the fuck option for months now.  He thinks that maybe, just maybe, tonight that's going to change.  

""My turn to grab a round, right?""  He pushes up, swaying towards Steve maybe more than necessary.  It's worth it to see the heat come up in Steve's eyes.  It's even worth it when Kono starts chanting at them ""One tequila!  Two tequila!  Three tequila! FLOOR!""  She topples into Chin, giggling madly and he can't help but grin back.  Fuck, she's beautiful, maybe even more so since he'll never have to worry about fucking up with her since he'll never get to touch her.  Way better all around.

His tie slips free and drops to the floor and Steve bends down, picks it up and dangles it from his fingers.  ""You lost something.""  He grabs it, fingers sliding over Steve's in an incredibly obvious way.  Yeah, fuck subtle, they're going to do this the same way they do everything else, strong and loud and slamming right against each other.  ""You know what they say, tequila makes your clothes fall off.""  He takes a second to appreciate the look of shock on Steve's face before sauntering off towards the bar.

He makes it almost all the way there before there's a strong hand on the small of his back, steering him firmly in the direction of the bathroom.  He's tempted to make a crack about public indecency and ""do you come here often"" with an emphasis on the come.  But his mouth's gone dry in anticipation and, really, he'll let Steve win this round as long as he gets those hands somewhere else within the next few minutes.

Steve manages to clear out the bathroom with just one glare and he grins, filing away that bit of knowledge for later use.  It's nice to know that The Glare can be used for good.  He turns around, raises an eyebrow, shifting his weight to his back foot.  It's going to lessen the impact when Steve shoves him up against the wall.

Steve does and then they're devouring each other.  It's wet and messy and he wonders, fleetingly, if he tastes just like Steve does.  They've had the same things to eat and drink today, after all.  Thought flee though when Steve's hands run up under his shirt and he moans low in his throat when Steve bites his neck.

""So now I know how to shut you up.""  Steve licks the shell of his ear and he bucks into him.  He grabs Steve's shoulders, spins him around and seals their mouths back together.  He'll say something about that later, preferably when he's got Steve lying underneath him, both of them sticky and sated.  He slows the kiss down.  He's pretty sure if he doesn't, then the joke he was going to make about public indecency won't be so funny.  Steve's hands settle at his waist and the kiss is just as hungry, maybe even hungrier, now that they aren't both trying to take control.  He finally pulls back, leaning his face into the curve of Steve's neck.

""I've got clean sheets.""  He smooths a hand down Steve's side, feeling the movement as Steve laughs.  

""Well it's high time we got them dirty.""  Steve pushes him back and he goes easily.  ""We can walk to your place from here, right.""

""Thank God.""  The words are heartfelt and Steve laughs, wide and free.  Fuck it's a good look on him.  

""After you then.""  Steve gestures and he leads the way out, taking a moment to glance back and toss ""Not if I have anything to say about that"" over his shoulder

He's rewarded by a stutter in Steve's step and a harsh intake of breath and he knows one thing for sure.  He's definitely going to remember the rest of this night."

"event","In a moment of weakness, I promised to write Lucy some John/Matt uniform porn.  This would be it.

Die Hard slash.  John/Matt.  Sexy boy touching.  

<lj-cut text=""Good Boy Gone Bad""."">

It started innocently enough.  At least that was Matt's story and he was sticking to it.  In fact, it was even true.  To a point.  After all, he'd been incredibly good and hadn't done what he would have done with anyone else he'd suddenly become friends with, namely researching the hell out of him online and ferreting out each and every single solitary picture and video and horribly embarrassing blog post in existence.  No.  He hadn't done that this time.  After the hearings and the screaming by the FBI and CIA and NSA and LMNOP and everyone else, well, he'd expected McClane to say ""See you, kid"" and never to hear from him again.  Okay, maybe he'd get weekly ""touch my daughter and I'll kill you"" voice mails but that was it.  He didn't expect McClane to even acknowledge his existence, let alone want to meet up for beers and pizza.  But the next thing he knew, he'd mentioned to Lucy that he was moving to Brooklyn and she whipped out her cell and McClane was there bossing him around and mocking him for not being able to lift small cars or a box of books with a single hand and glaring at the moving people for trying to dick him over on the fees.  And then McClane was telling him about this great place a few blocks over that would deliver at like 4 in the morning, no problem, and they were having pizza and Matt was laughing so hard he thought he was going to stroke and McClane was grinning at him like he'd killed him with a car or something and they'd become friends or something.  And Matt felt wrong hunting him down online when McClane was such a dedicated Luddite.  

Plus there was the completely insignificant point that the one time that he did, well, the number of fanboy sites freaked even him out.  Even though that wasn't why he was respecting his privacy, not at all, it was completely and totally an act of deep sacrifice on Matt's part.  Completely.  Totally.  And there was absolutely no element of being afraid of being glared at until his head exploded when McClane found out that factored into the decision.  Not at all.  Totally an act of noble self-sacrifice.

So it absolutely wasn't his fault that he was unprepared for coming across that picture when he was hanging out in Lucy's room.  Not his fault at all that his mouth went dry and his eyes wide when he saw that picture of John Motherfucking McClane, Real Live Action Hero, dressed up in that uniform.  The one that fit just right and made him look even more like some kind of wet dream and holy hell someone should have told him about this because he thought his knees were going to give and he was pretty sure that Lucy would kill him with, like, her shoe if he stole a picture of her dad to wank to.  And she would know, she could do that creepy McClane stare at you and read your mind thing and holy hell, it was not his fault that he wasn't ready for being confronted with porn like that all out of the blue.

""Hey, Lucy?""  Matt was proud that he managed to not sound like an utterly crazed hormonal teenager.  ""What's up with your dad being all dressed up?  Isn't he, like, allergic to formalities and it makes him break out in hives or something?""

""What?""  Lucy glanced over, then rolled her eyes.  ""God, seriously, Dad acts like having to dress up is a fate worse than jumping off a building that's blowing up behind him.  I think that was when they gave him the citation for not letting all the money in the mint be stolen.  Or maybe when he killed those paramilitary guys?  You know, the ones in DC who tried to blow up Mom's plane?  One of those.""  She snagged the picture from Matt's hands and set it back on her dresser.  ""I keep it out because it really drives him nuts, he hates having to wear the uniform, like he says, it means that either there's a funeral or some kind of ceremony where he has to be polite and that's a fate worse than death.""

""Ahhh, yes, I can see how being forced to make nice nice with the President or somebody insignificant like that would be much worse than being shot.""  Matt glanced back one more time and then launched into a discussion of the many, many flaws of Lucy's new boyfriend.  After all, her beating him would completely distract her from the way he couldn't stop staring at the picture.

He wasn't a proud man.  Oh, sure, he could be an arrogant prick about how much better and smarter he was than basically everyone but Warlock but that was different.  When it came to certain things, such as the rich and varied tapestry of his fantasy life, he wasn't proud.  He managed to make it home before he began pounding on his keyboard like a rat pushing the button for food.  An hour later and there it was.  Picture after picture after picture of McClane in dress blues displayed on monitor after monitor.  Matt blinked, rubbed his mouth then muttered out loud ""Fuck, if I didn't have carpal tunnel before, I will now.""  In the back of his mind he was grateful that his place was in an old brick building.  He'd always been a screamer.

So things were fine, they were, he and McClane continued to meet for the random beer and Matt showed him how to do exotic computer tricks such as turning it on and sending an email and then Matt would go home and scroll through the pictures and, really, there had to be something less crude to call it then jerking off and things were great and wonderful and Matt was utterly content to continue like this indefinitely, what with there being no possible way that fantasy and reality would ever collide.  It was the perfect relationship, in its way.  Completely.  Totally.

At least until that benefit thing came up and the promoters pimped out how the New American Heroes were going to be there and Lucy threatened him with a fiery death if he didn't go and McClane growled ""Fuck, kid, she's making me go so you better grow a pair and show up.  Hell, I'm picking you up to make sure you don't pussy out"" and it would have been fine, really, totally fine, he'd even considered the possibility of McClane in a tux, many, many, many times but it would have been fine, seriously, it would have been.  At least, it would have been if he hadn't opened the door and there stood McClane.  In.  The.  Uniform.

In retrospect, perhaps slamming the door in McClane's face wasn't the best possible reaction.  But it wasn't his fault, it totally wasn't, he wasn't expecting that and he wasn't ready for that and holy fuck opening his door to his wet dream come to life was a bit startling and he'd just reacted.  He should have expected the ""What the fuck, kid, did you have a psychotic break?""  And he really should have expected that McClane would kick the door in when he didn't answer.  And, just possibly, he should have expected that McClane would barrel through, gun drawn, totally assuming that he was being held hostage or something, what with the door slamming and the muteness and all.  But he didn't.  Mainly because all higher brain functions went offline the moment he saw McClane.  In.  The.  Uniform.  In.  His.  Place.  Holding.  His.  Gun.

So it was completely and totally not his fault at all, in any way, when he grabbed McClane by the shoulders and slammed him against the wall and kissed him like he was going to die if he didn't and possibly if he did what with McClane having the gun still out and all.  And it so totally and completely wasn't his fault that his whimpered ""John"" like that when McClane spun them around and slammed him against the wall and kissed him back, but, like, ten thousand times better.  Not his fault.  Not at all.  And it wasn't his fault that the buttons came off when he started clawing at the jacket when John growled, fucking growled, in his ear ""Wall, floor or bed, your choice, Matt"".  It wasn't his fault that his knees gave at that and they wound up on the floor, Matt's shirt winding up out in the hall and John's dress shoes, holy fuck the dress shoes and Matt didn't have time or energy for a new kink, not right now, not when John was pinning him to the floor and biting his neck and his hips were grinding down on Matt's and Matt was clawing at his back and holy fuck he was going to come now, right now and then he was screaming and the world went white.

So, really, it wasn't his fault that John had to call up Lucy and get her to make their apologies since there was no way there were going to make the benefit.  Not with Matt's broken door and John's ripped jacket and Matt's pants God only knew where.  And particularly not when John grinned at him, that smug, arrogant, shit eating, sexy as all fuck grin and said ""You mean all I needed to do to get you in bed all this time was to wear the uniform?  God, you're easy, kid.""  Then Matt had to open his mouth to protest that he wasn't that easy.  But then John kissed him, deep and dirty and they started staggering back towards his bed and, fine, sure, he was that easy but he was going to get laid and that was the important thing.  Matt managed to keep it together enough to kill the circuit breaker on the way past his set up.  No need to let John see precisely how much he liked the uniform.  It was going to be way more fun to show him.

Ha!  And <lj user=""lucylooo""> thought I wouldn't actually write it just because I never actually write any of the things I say I will.  Pffft.  What's vacation for if not for writing boyporn.

Do not judge me about the Rihanna title, I heart her."

"event","I get my mail today and there were two thin envelopes from my bank.  That is never good and when I opened them, that fear was confirmed.  According to the bank, I was overdrawn.  According to me, I wasn't.  I come back up to check my account, freaking out that someone got my info, and determined that the bank was right, I am overdrawn.  Long story short, when I got paid on the 7th and balanced the check book I marked that my rent check cleared before I got paid.  It hadn't.  Thus, I was working off the assumption that I had $460 more than I did.  head/desk  I'm an idiot.  I'm now $270 overdrawn.  head/desk

Before anyone asks, I get paid again on Thursday and I'll be fine until then.  I've got more than enough room on my cards to get me through and I'll be getting reimbursed for the Philly trip.  I was going to immediately flip that money onto one of my credit cards, but that can wait until January.  I'm going to put up a fuss to get my expense check on Monday, put that right in the bank and then I'll be fine.  I feel stupid is all.  This is the first time I've done this in a few years and arrrrgggghhhhh.  The only thing that's still pending is my car/apartment insurance payment on the 20th which is an automatic debit.  I get paid the 21st.  If I can't get the expense check in before then, I'll call my agent and charge it. Sigh.  Am moron."

"event","Happy Thanksgiving!  Today, and, really, every day, I am thankful for the following:

Incredible friends who love me no matter how insane I might think I am.
My computer to let me talk to most of said friends on a constant basis.  
Electricity to power said computer to let me talk to said friends.
Clean, safe and running water.  Considering that half of my town was without water from last Thursday until about 11:00 last night, this is a wonderful reminder of what a miracle that is.
Modern medicine without which I would be dead.
My parents for adopting me and loving me and giving me a rock solid assurance that I am loved, no matter what.
My car so that I can go anywhere I want pretty much any time I want.
My job no matter how much I might hate it because it keeps me fed, clothed, puts gas in my car and otherwise allows me to live instead of survive.
My life in general.  It might be small and it might be hard at times but it's such a gift and I do know that.

I hope everyone has a wonderful day."

The counterpart to that?  Auntie Mame - ""Life is a banquet.  And most poor suckers are starving to death.""

Has your fandom decided that the OTP is exchanging coded messages O'Lurve through clothing and accessory choices?  Again?

Then come!  Join us in <lj comm=""theteeniesthe"">.  A community for the saner side of fandom.  I'll sum up from the About info for the comm:

""The Teenies The! is a community for those of us who are, how to put this politely, tired of dealing with teenie bullshit. Really, not all of us believe that you have to be put out to fandom pasture when you turn 20. This is primarily going to be a Supernatural community at the moment but We The Mods are open to suggestions as to other fandoms that y'all would like to see represented.  

Membership is moderated.Why? Please refer to the name of this community. You must be over 18 due to the smuttage that we hope will be posted here.

If you want to join, click the join button and a request will be sent. We The Mods will attempt to respond in a timely fashion, taking into consideration time zone issues and work and other life type issues. But promptness will be atttempted.""

We're not many at the moment but we're fun and don't bite unless asked.  Also we're very very very Papa friendly.  In case anyone's interested in that.  *cough* <lj user=""robanybody""> *cough*  We'd love to have more people and now seems like a good time to go trolling for members.

A drop of real estate.  Some DUI defense.  Think Bill Murray in Wild Things.  You *know* Dean would have the neck brace.  

This is, of course, merely a facade for their REAL job of Killing Bad Things.  But they've realized that even Bad Things need legal representation too and that this is merely another front in the war.

And you KNOW Dean scored 5 points higher on the LSATs then Sam did and he rubs that in and then Sam whips back that he passed the bar first shot thankyouverymuch and Dean is all yeah in INDIANA not California you wussy boy and then they beat one another and roll around.

""Ummm,"" Dean squinted at the paper under his father's palm, ""that appears to be my term paper.""  He grabbed the oil and carefully began to wipe down the slide rail.  ""Can you hand me the bore brush please?""  

""Yes.  That also appears to be a D.  Goddammit, Dean, I know you can do better than that!  Tell me the truth, when you claimed you were at the library doing research, what were you really doing?  Fooling around with the preacher's daughter again?""  His father's voice was cold.  ""You know the last thing that we need right now is to be run out of another town.""

Dean flushed, hands shaking a little as he concentrated on making sure that every possible speck of residue was out of the barrel.  ""I was doing research.  Research on the history of Elmhurst Pines so that when you went out there you knew exactly where to go to find the bones so you didn't have to waste a week trying to figure things out.""  He glanced up.  ""I don't know, I figured that was a lot more important than some stupid paper on the French Revolution.""  

""Dean.""  His father dropped onto the chair next to him.  ""We've talked about this.  You only have a few months to go until you graduate and there's no reason for you not to be doing better.  You're smarter than that and you and I both know it.  What are you trying to do, flunk out on purpose?""

The barrel fit back onto the slide with a click.  ""Dad, I don't know why you're upset about this, I'm 18 now, if it's such a fucking big deal, I'll take the GED and get it over with, this going to school shit is ridiculous.  I mean, what the hell does it matter, it's not like I'm going to be going to college unless you've found somewhere that has a real program in killing evil things.  It's stupid that we're stuck in this place for me to go to classes that don't mean anything.  I just, I don't see why you won't let me drop out.""  He sighted down the barrel, making sure everything was flush.  ""It's fucking stupid.""

""Don't you swear at me, boy.""  His father pointed at him sternly, jaw set.  ""It is not stupid for you to get a diploma, it is not stupid for me to want you to be education and it is NOT stupid to stay here.  In case it's escaped your notice, Dean, this is NOT all about you."" 

Dean flushed, eyes cutting over to the door to the living room.  He could just see Sam curled in the corner of the couch, headphones on, pretending that he couldn't hear the yelling.  He was surrounded by a pile of books, the same way he always was, paper strewn around him with notes scribbled front and back, highlighters right next to him, pens with the caps chewed and a glass of water right there.  Dean stared for a second, then met his father's eyes.  ""Yeah, right, I forgot, it's about genuis boy over there.  Not all of us can do that overachiever bullshit you know.  Some of us are only good at one thing.""  Dean lifted the gun, aiming towards a kitchen wall.  ""Guess you're going to have to accept that you only got one smart one.""  He pulled the trigger, smiling a little when it broke at precisely the weight he wanted.  ""I know I'm the brawn, Dad, and I'm fine with that.""

""Dean.""  There was a loud sigh and he could hear the drumming of his father's fingers on the table.  ""I'm not having this conversation with you again.  You are not dropping out.  You are going to do better.  And if you give me any more lip, you are not going to be going hunting with me for a month.""   Dean bit his lip, not looking up when his father stood.  ""Your brother's gifts are different than yours, not better.  I hope someday you'll grow up enough to realize that.  Nice job on making those rock salt shells, by the way, they were a life saver last week.  Now see if you can't focus that creativity on your book report.""  A faint smile crossed his father's lips.  ""I think you could have some interesting things to say about whether or not magical realism is more magical or real.""  

Dean nodded.  ""Yeah, fine, I'll try. Anything else you want to yell about?  I'd rather get it all over with at once.""

""Not at the moment, but don't push it.  And don't forget, I'm leaving in the morning for New Jersey, someone called and claimed  there were more sightings in the pine barrens.  I should be gone about 10 days, there's money in my night stand.  Make sure you and Sam eat some real food and not just pizza, okay?  I'm counting on you, Dean.""

""Yeah.""  Dean looked back out to the living room.  ""I know.  I won't let anything happen to him, Dad.""

""I know.""  His father squeezed his shoulder.  ""Just try to do better, okay?  I'm heading to bed.""  

""Yeah.""  Dean watched as father stopped to say something to Sam, Sam smiling as he said good night.  ""Yeah, I know what's important.""  He reached out, grabbing another gun and the rags, fingers deft on the metal.

Hansonfic.  Gen.  Written for the Underneath challenge, my song was Hey.

<lj-cut text=""Don't you want some truth?"">

<EM>You want trips on a white yacht for two 
Hey, you want Beverly Heights 
Bright lights, late nights</EM></P><P>
The line between reckless and stupid could be thin indeed.  And that, after all, was the 
thrill of it.  Tay took one last drag on his cigarette, then ground it beneath his heel.  A 
quick glance around, then he ducked into the club, blinking quickly as his eyes attempted 
to adjust to the pulsing light.  It was damp and hot here, a marked contrast to the cold of 
the street and he quickly shrugged out of his jacket, handing it over with barely a glance.  
He slipped the claim check into his pocket, hips moving a bit to the pound of the bass.  A 
pungent mix of testosterone and tequila hung in the air and he inhaled deeply.  Ah, yes.  
Yes, this was far more like it.  He reached up, tugging the tie out of his hair, then slid into 
the crowd, tank already beginning to cling to him as he started to sweat.  This was far 
more like it indeed.  Ten minutes, fifteen on the outside, and he'd have exactly what he 
came here to get.  He smirked as he felt the hand glide across his ass.  Make that five.</P><P>He stumbled a bit as they staggered towards the dark corners of the club, panting and 
moans audible over the music.  ""Sorry, sorry,"" he nimbly stepped to the side, trying to not 
fall over anyone else while Tom, Tim, Tony, whatever worked his fly open.   </P><P>""Fuck you, watch it.""  Tay's head snapped around, Terry, Todd, whoever it was 
forgotten.  He knew that voice.  Motherfucker he knew that voice.</P><P>""Evan?""  Tay absently batted away the hand groping down his pants.  ""What the fuck?  
What the FUCK are you doing?""  He kicked at the guy on the floor.  ""Get his dick out of 
your mouth.""</P><P>The man leaning against the wall blinked once, twice, squinting to see through the haze.  
""Who the fuck do you think you are, asshole, get your own pretty little cocksucker,"" his 
voice trailed off.  ""Oh fuck.""</P><P>""Yeah, oh fuck.""  Tay felt his fists clench.  ""So.  Evan.  That sure as fuck doesn't look 
like my brother down there on his knees.""  Tay kicked at the guy again.  ""If you know 
what's good for you, you'll get up.""  It didn't take more than that for the guy to back 
away, hands out.  ""Get out of here.""  Tay turned back, eyes flashing.  ""You have ten 
seconds to tell me why I shouldn't kick your ass right here.""</P><P>A cold smirk was his reply.  ""Please.  I can break you like a twig.""  Evan leaned forward 
and Tay could smell the whiskey on his breath.  ""Sometimes I just need to have my cock 
sucked by someone who knows how.  And that dear brother of yours, well, let's just say 
that mouth ain't good for everything.""</P><P>""You piece of shit.""  That dampness in his palms was probably blood from the way his 
nails were digging into his flesh but Tay ignored it.  ""You fucking piece of shit.  I knew 
you were bad news.  Get out of here.  Get out of here before I beat the shit out of you.""</P><P>""Yeah, right.""  Evan laughed again.  ""Like you'd stand a chance.  And then you'll have to 
explain to your mommy just why you got arrested for a fight back where all the pretty 
boys were fucking.  You don't want that do you?""</P><P>""Fuck you.""  Tay glanced at his watch.  ""You have fifteen minutes to call Ike and tell him 
the truth.  Or I will.""  Tay took a deep breath then turned his back.  ""Oh and Evan?  Be 
sure to zip up.""   </P><P>He staggered back through the club, somehow managing to make it to the bathroom 
before he threw up.  He rinsed out his mouth, then glanced up, reflection fractured in the 
dirty mirror.  ""Fuck.  Ike.""  He splashed some water on his face, barely remembering to 
stop for his coat before he took off at a run, praying he made it home in time to warn Zac 
that all hell was about to break loose.</P><P><EM>Hey, you want that fine white wine on my dime</EM></P><P>""Tay, could you stop pacing for a second, you're giving me a headache.  Not to mention 
blocking the television.""  Zac chucked a pillow at Tay's head.  ""Seriously, you're going 
to have a stroke if you keep this up.""</P><P>""Don't you care, even a little bit, that I ran into Ike's boyfriend getting blown by some 
random guy in the back of some sleazy club?  And that you know it's been hours and Ike 
hasn't called me back and he's not answering the phone or his cell and God only knows 
what else that fucker did to him and who else that asshole's been fucking and oh my God, 
Ike said, he said, they weren't, you know, because they were together and he was so 
happy and, fuck, if anything happens to Ike, I don't know what we're going to do and 
and"" Tay turned, pacing back the other direction, teeth worrying at his thumbnail.  ""What 
are we going to do?""</P><P>""The first thing we're going to do is NOT freak the fuck out.""  Zac grabbed Tay as he 
wandered past, hands firm on Tay's shoulders.  ""The second thing we're going to do is 
wait.  Look, if Ike's not answering his phones, there's probably a really good reason, 
okay?  And freaking out is NOT going to help anything.  He's going to need us to be nice 
and calm.""  Zac pulled Tay into a tight hug.  ""And I'm going to ignore the fact that you 
were out picking up again.""</P><P>Tay wrapped his arms around Zac's waist.  ""I'm always careful.  Not to mention safe.  
I'm not stupid."" </P><P>""I know, but still.""  Zac sighed.  ""Besides, it's a good thing in a way.  Now we can hate 
the asshole for a reason.  God, Ike's going to be, I don't even know what he's going to 
be.""</P><P>""Devastated.""  Tay pulled back.  ""I'm going to call again.  God, that asshole probably 
took off.""  He grabbed the phone off the coffee table, punching the speed dial as he 
started pacing again.  </P><P>Zac sprawled back down on the couch.  ""Don't get my hopes up like that.  Is he 
answering?""</P><P>""No.""  Tay thumbed the phone off.  ""Maybe he has the ringer off.""</P><P>""Maybe.""  Zac chewed on his bottom lip.  ""Do you think we should go over there?  See 
what's going on.  I mean, if you have to tell him, wouldn't you rather do it in person?"" </P><P>""I'd rather not have to tell him at all.  I mean, what if he thinks I'm lying, he knows that I 
hate that asshole.""  Tay pushed his hair off his face.  ""What if he doesn't believe me?""</P><P>""Tay, Ike knows you'd never lie to him about something like that.  And he deserves to 
know, I mean, fuck, he needs to know, particularly if they aren't, if he thinks they're 
monogamous.""  Zac tipped his head back, letting out a strangled yell.  ""Fuck, this 
SUCKS.""</P><P>""Yeah.""  Tay leaned against the window ledge, fingers twitching.  ""I think we should go 
over there."" </P><P>""Are you sure?""  Zac pushed up when Tay nodded.  ""Okay, we'll go over there.  Fuck.  I 
really thought that maybe this time he wasn't going to get screwed over.""  </P><P>""Me too.""  Tay shook his head.  ""It's not fair, he deserves better than this."" 
 
Zac snorted.  ""Preaching to the choir here.""  He glanced at the clock.  ""We better cab it, I 
think its all express over by his place now.""</P><P>""Okay.""  Tay shrugged into his coat and had just reached for his keys when the buzzer 
sounded.</P><P>""Guys?  Anyone up?""  Ike's weary voice echoed through the room and Tay and Zac 
nearly collided as they dived for the buzzer.</P><P>""Yeah, we're up,"" Zac buzzed Ike in.  ""Door'll be open when you get up.""</P><P>""See you in a sec then.""</P><P>Tay looked at Zac, eyes wide.  ""This isn't good.""</P><P>Zac flipped the locks, sliding back the deadbolts.  ""Don't freak, not until we know what's 
going on.""</P><P>""Okay, okay.""  Tay dropped into a chair, eyes locked on the door.  </P><P>They heard the ding when the elevator stopped and then the door opened, Ike closing it 
behind him with a quiet snick snick snick as he reset the locks.  </P><P>""Ike?""  Zac bit his lip, hand hovering over Ike's shoulder.  ""What's going on?""</P><P>""Oh, not too much.""  Ike dropped his messenger bag then leaned against the wall, 
pinching between his eyes.  ""I figured I'd have a nice relaxing night in, after all, Evan 
had a late meeting and I could get some reading done.  It was great.  Until the part where 
he came home and announced that my faggot little brother ran into him at a club and all 
hell broke loose.""  Ike laughed and Tay and Zac winced at the bitterness laced through it.  
""Funny as hell to hear him call someone a faggot.""</P><P>""Ike,"" Tay's voice trailed off.  ""I'm so damn sorry."" </P><P>""For what?  Finding out that he was fucking around on me?  Believe me, that's 
something I need to know.""  Ike sighed.  ""Can I sit down?""</P><P>""Dude, of course.""  Zac tugged him over to the couch and Ike dropped down, head back, 
eyes closed.  ""You look like hell.""</P><P>""That's good because I feel like hell.  Shit.  This sucks.""  Ike sighed heavily.  ""Like 
seriously sucks.""</P><P>Tay leaned forward, fingers barely brushing Ike's hand.  ""What happened?""</P><P>""He came home, started yelling, then I finally figured out what he was yelling about and 
then I yelled back and I think there was some throwing stuff in there in the middle and 
yeah, it was pretty ugly.""  Ike glanced at Tay.  ""Whatever you said really did the trick, he 
was pretty freaked out.""</P><P>Tay shrugged.  ""I told him the truth.  Either he told you or I would have.  I just wished I'd 
beat the shit out of him first.""</P><P>""Me too.""  Ike pinched the bridge of his nose again.  ""Damn.  I have a headache.""</P><P>""You want something?  We've got Tylenol or something around here somewhere.""  Zac 
rubbed at Ike's shoulder.  ""Or do you want a drink or something?""</P><P>""No, I'll get something in a minute, thanks.""  Ike smiled faintly.  ""I hope you guys don't 
mind if I crash here tonight.""</P><P>""Dude, of course we don't mind.""  Tay squeezed Ike's hand.  ""It's totally fine.""</P><P>""So fine.""  Zac nudged Ike with his foot.  ""Tell me you dumped his sorry ass.""</P><P>Ike frowned.  ""I'm not sure if I dumped him or if he dumped me.  All I know is that he 
threw me out.""</P><P>Zac stared at him gape mouthed and Tay let out a yelp.  ""Wait, he threw YOU out?  What 
the FUCK?""</P><P>""I don't know, all I know is that there was a lot of screaming and the next thing I knew, 
he was slamming the door in my face.  Not that I really cared about seeing him at that 
point but still.""  Ike shook his head.  ""At least I had my wallet and managed to grab my 
bag on the way out.""</P><P>""Yeah.""  Zac sighed.  ""We'll go and throw him out tomorrow.  And then get the locks 
changed.""</P><P>""At least I never put him on the lease.  Shit.  This is going to be a mess.  Again.""  Ike 
punched one of the throw pillows.  ""I'm going to have to start getting tested again too.""</P><P>Tay nodded, swallowing hard.  ""Yeah.  I'll go with you.""</P><P>""If you want.  Damn it, I was supposed to be past all this.""  Ike sighed again.  ""It's never 
ever going to end, is it?""</P><P>""It will.  Somehow.""  Zac bit his lip.  ""Ummm, Ike?  Doesn't he have a copy of your 
Amex?""</P><P>""Fuck.  Yes.  Shit.""  Ike struggled up, trying to work his wallet out of his pocket.  ""And a 
couple of other cards too.  Shit.""</P><P>""I'll call and cancel them all right now.""  Tay held out a hand.  ""I mean, I know your 
Social and Mom's maiden name and all that jazz.""</P><P>Ike handed the wallet over with a grateful smile.  ""Thanks.  And I'll close the bank 
account out tomorrow.  I think there's only like ten grand in there so, you know, if he 
takes off it with, I'll just have to deal.""  Ike slumped against Zac.  ""This SUCKS.  Which 
is ironic, since according to that asshole I don't.""</P><P>Zac winced.  ""He's an asshole who never deserved you.""</P><P>""And what does that say about me for picking him?""  Ike rested his head on Zac's 
shoulder.  ""Other than I have the worst taste in men ever.""</P><P>Tay looked up from dialing.  ""It means you're a good person who trusted someone who 
took advantage of you is what.  Yeah, hi, I need to cancel my Amex, my wallet got 
stolen.""  Tay wandered towards the kitchen as Zac wrapped his arms around Ike.</P><P>""Don't tell Mom about this yet, okay?  Please?""  Ike pushed up, eyes anxious.  ""I don't 
want her to know about any of this, just that we broke up, okay?""</P><P>Zac nodded.  ""I won't, I promise.""  He tugged Ike back down.  ""You want to sleep in 
with me?  The bed's way more comfy than the couch.""</P><P>""If that's okay.""  Ike yawned.  ""Besides, I'll need my rest so I can throw him out on his 
ass tomorrow.""
""Damn skippy.""  Zac dropped a kiss on the top of Ike's head.  ""And we'll be right there 
to help."" </P><P>""I know.""  Ike smiled a little.  ""Thanks.""</P><P>""No problem.""  Tay leaned against the doorway leading towards the kitchen.  ""I cancelled 
all your cards, they're going to FedEx new ones.  And I told them they were stolen so if 
that asshole tries to run them up, he'll get arrested.""</P><P>""Good.""  Ike yawned.  ""God, I hate this.""</P><P>""Yeah.""  Zac stood, pulling Ike up with him.  ""Okay, bed time.  Then ass kicking time.""</P><P>""Hell yeah.""  Tay struck a kung fu pose, grinning when Ike laughed.  ""It'll be fun.""</P><P>""Yup.""  Ike yawned again.  ""I'll even let you take the first shot.""</P><P>""Cool.""  Tay grabbed onto Ike's wrist.  ""And you're sleeping in with me.  My bed's 
bigger.""</P><P>""That's because you're a huge perv.""  Zac danced back as Tay swung at him.  Ike just 
laughed.</P><P>
<EM>Hey, after Sunset Drive cruising, baby 
You're just yesterday's prize</EM></P><P>""Woah.""  Zac blinked.  Then he blinked again.  ""I have to say, I didn't think your tastes 
were that minimalistic.""</P><P>""Um, not usually.""  Ike stared.  ""I can't believe this.""</P><P>Tay turned in a circle, arms out.  ""How the hell did he find movers at three in the 
morning?""  His voice echoed in the empty space.  ""Dude, he took the pictures.  That's not 
right.""</P><P>""I know.""  Ike opened the hall closet.  ""Not to mention my leather coat.  It doesn't even 
fit him.""</P><P>Zac padded into the kitchen, opening the cupboards one by one.  All the shelves were 
empty.  ""He took the food.""  He opened the fridge door.  ""All the food.""  Zac blinked 
again when he opened the freezer.  ""He took the ice cube trays.  What kind of sick bitch 
takes the ice cube trays?""</P><P>""Apparently him.""  Ike pulled out his cell.  ""Hold on.""  He dialed, waited a moment, then 
started punching numbers in.  ""Motherfucker.  He cleared out the bank account.""</P><P>Tay snorted.  ""Gee there's a shock.  I'm going to check the bedroom.""  They could hear 
the sound of drawers being opened and closed, then Tay came back.  ""Okay, well, the 
good news?  You can get a whole new set of insurance salesman suits."" </P><P>Ike took a halfhearted swipe at Tay.  ""Ass.  I guess I should be grateful, at least he 
cleaned too.""</P><P>Zac nodded.  ""There is that.""  </P><P>Tay nodded his agreement as well.  ""Yeah, I mean it's not like he took, wait, wait.""  Tay 
grabbed Ike's arm, a little pale.  ""Your guitars.""</P><P>""Are at the studio except my acoustic which I happened to drop off to be restrung 
yesterday.  Good thing, huh?  And all my notebooks were in my bag.  The laptop too, so 
that's fine.""  Ike heaved out a sigh.  ""It's just stuff.""</P><P>""Yeah.""  Zac coughed.  ""I ummm, did find this.""  He handed a folded piece of paper over 
to Ike who took it, one eyebrow raised.</P><P>""Thanks.""  He skimmed it over, face darkening as he read.  ""That motherfucker.""  </P><P>""What?""  Tay yanked it out of Ike's hand.  ""That ASSHOLE.""</P><P>""What?""  Zac grabbed it, anger growing as he read.  ""Wait, he thinks he DESERVES to 
take all this?""</P><P>""For putting up with my shit, yeah.""  Ike sprawled on the floor.  ""Asshole.""</P><P>Tay sprawled down next to him.  ""Complete asshole.""  He glanced at Ike.  ""You don't 
think he'd umm, you know.""  Tay waved a hand.  ""Threaten you or anything?""</P><P>""What, that he'd out me?""  Ike shook his head.  ""Nope.  Our dear Evan is just waiting for 
his grandfather to kick the bucket so he inherits.  And if he outs me, he outs himself and 
he'll be out of the will in a heartbeat.  So you know.  Mutually assured destruction.""</P><P>""Oh that's good to know.""  Zac held out a hand.  ""Tay, your lighter please."" </P><P>Tay handed it over, frowning for a moment before grinning evilly.  ""Don't you think Ike 
should do that?""</P><P>""What?""  Ike looked up and Zac waved the note, eyebrows waggling as he waved the 
lighter. ""Ohhhhhh, yeah.""  Ike pushed up.  ""Shall we repair to the kitchen, gentlemen?""</P><P>""After you, kind sir.""  Zac bowed, then handed over the note and the lighter.  </P><P>They gathered around the sink as Ike held the note up high.  ""Good riddance to bad 
trash.""  He flicked the lighter, holding the flame under a corner of the paper.  ""That does 
make the most satisfying sound, doesn't it?""  </P><P>""It really, really does.""  Tay put an arm around Ike's shoulders.  ""You're staying with us 
until you get new stuff.""</P><P>Zac looped his arm around Ike's waist.  ""Dude, you so are.""</P><P>""Of course.""  Ike dropped the note into the sink, watching as the last of it burned away.  
""I mean, I know you two aren't after me for my money.""</P><P>""Damn right.""  Zac grinned.  ""We need you to cook.""</P><P>Tay nodded vigorously.  ""And to clean, don't forget the cleaning.""</P><P>""You got it.""  Ike laughed, then turned on the water, rinsing the ashes down the drain.  
""Come on, let's go home.""</P><P>""Yeah.""  Tay took one last look around.  ""Home it is.""  He took the keys from Ike's hand 
once they were outside, looking the door behind them, then heading down the hall, Ike in 
stride with him.  None of them looked back.</P><P>  </lj-cut>

"event","I'm seriously starting to think I've got some sort of psychological imbalance. Nothing serious, of course, I'm not about to go off the deep end or anything, I've just got this tumultuous storm of different emotions flying around inside of me, and I'll go from being depressed to being cathartic to feeling empty without that special someone in my life to feeling whole with just my friends, all in the span of half an hour. I'm sure I'm not alone in this chaotic emotional distortion of mine, but it still annoys the crap out of me. Whenever my friends(namely: Joel and Steph) are at work, I feel I've lost touch with the outside world, and seeing as how I thrive on interaction with others, that gets me feeling down, though I've got no true reason to feel that way. Ugh, I think if I was given the choice to change anything about myself, I'd make myself more secure feeling about my relationships with my friends. Actually, I'd probably just make myself a lot hotter, but the secure thing is what I really need to do. Seriously, I'm worried my insecurities toward my relationships are going to ruin the very relationships I'm so pointlessly worried about. Whew, maybe I just need to relieve some tension. Maybe I just did. I certainly feel quite a bit better. Anyway, that's me, stay shway."

"event","Rant time, muthaf***as! Is there anyone in this world, anyone, who actually thinks that horrendous cover of ""Walk This Way"" by Macy Gay(oops, did I misspell that?) actually qualifies as music? Evidently, because she's squawking her little heart out in those Sony ""Let's get rich by following the trail iPod blazed"" commercials. Dear God, I hope someone in their advertising committee loses their job. Heck, for creating such a monstrosity of a commercial as that, I hope they lose their family. In case you haven't seen this eyesore among eyesores of a commercial, picture this: large, blue tinted glass walls slowly rotating around Macy Gay as she clumsily and unsuccessfully tries to recreate the illusion of rhythm by moving her pudgy hips from side to side and flapping her arms in an awkward windmill motion, as if to say ""Look at me, I'm a chubby psycho b***h who can't sing"". That's what I got out of it, at least. The sad thing is, the Sony metoo actually looks like a pretty good product. The sadder thing is, I'm afraid that commercial might actually help their sales, and make them believe that chubby people doing covers of classic songs is really the way to go. Oh, and no sending me things about how ""iPod so wasn't the first mp3 player, they didn't blaze that trail."" I know that, I'm referring to bringing mp3's to the mainstream. Now good night, ye of little faith, and stay shway."

"event","Hello all, I have returned for yet another episode of ""That Guy."" What to tell, what to tell? I'm getting my check tomorrow that should give me a good 200 bucks, enough for my insurance, so I'll only need another 200 for my ticket. I managed to scrounge up an extra 20 to get Steph something, so I'd at least be able to say I got one of my friends something. I got her Napoleon Dynamite on digital video disc. She loved it, I'm proud to say. It wasn't exactly the same as what I was going to get her, but the reaction was still well worth it. Now if she'd just shut up about how cute Jettas are. I swear to Allah, she mentioned them or pointed one out at least seven different times, completely unprompted. Fag. So yeah, today I woke up around ten, got dressed and went with Joel to do his christmas shopping from about eleven to one thirty, then went to Steph's and watched Napoleon with her and Kristie(and Alex, but she doesn't count). By the time the movie was over, I was already gonna be late for work, so I called and said I was stuck in traffic. Then I actually did get stuck in traffic, so instead of being twenty minutes late, I was almost two hours late('twas worth it though, I had fun). They didn't really mind, thank God, and I just finished up the abandons for them. Then I came home and killed some snakes, frogs, 'gators and squirrels to eat(in Metal Gear Solid 3, I could never kill an alligator in real life: I'd feel too guilty). And that, I suppose, is that. There, I updated, happy?"

Strange thing is, even though the only basis for these assumptions was my age/sex/name/sexuality, therefor rendering it virtually useless, it still made me feel good, if only a little bit.

"event","F the United Church of Christ. F their twisted cynicism, F their unchristian portrayal of their own religion, and F their advertising campaign. I just saw a commercial for them, and it had a big church with these hulking skinhead white guys standing at the door, which was roped off, and every time a white person walked up, they'd  let them through, but if any minority came around they would be turned away. Then some text flashed up and said ""Jesus didn't turn people away, neither do we."" Alright, not only are they desperately trying to reach out to the black ""minority""(which, in New Orleans at least, they're not. According to the 2000 census, New Orleans is 67.3% black), they're implying that other churches would turn away someone merely because of their skin colour. Now, I know just as well as anyone that many christians are hypocrites, but even as the people known worldwide as the most hypocritical, the majority of us aren't racist. Jeezie creezie, these jerks are the reason I don't blame people for disliking christians. Poop. Well, exams are tomorrow, so I must away. Until we meet again, my friends, stay shway."

Ah well, I've been exposed now, and I'm happy to be so. At work today I got to zone shoes(happy!). It's been so long since I've even looked at anything Nike, I was surprised to see Nike shoes there. I honestly started to feel a little sick when I was organizing the Nikes, like I was helping their sales or something. Of course, I would never actually help their sales, as they are evil corporate swine who, as most know but few care about, participate heavily in child slave labour. Boycott Nike, folks, or at least try to avoid purchasing their stuff(which is completely different). So anyways, yes. Food. Sleep. All that jazz. Or none of it, if you're not a big Miles Davis fan.

"event","Whew, this was a weekend unlike any other, in the sense that it rapidly transversed from a ""sucks balls"" weekend to a ""rocks my face"" weekend and back again, numerous times per day. I think I just came home after work Friday, so that doesn't count as part of the weekend. Then after work Saturday, I went and spent the night at Pink's house, which was shway. I played Custom Robo and Mario 64 DS all night, and ate me some Hot Pockets for good measure. In case this sound dull to you, you should know this was the ""rocks my face"" section of the weekend. Then Sunday I missed church in the morning, but I went to Pastor Sidney's goodbye dinner, which was fun, but sad at the same time, because Sid is tres awesome. Then I went to the movies and to Marble Slab with Alex, which was at the same time face-rocking goodness and ball-sucking badness. The face-rocking region of this was, of course, effing Marble Slab and a kick-A movie. The bad part was that Alex informed me that she liked me, which plagued me with guilt for not liking her back. And then, to top it all off, on the way home I got a ticket for going 91 in a 70, which sucks(in case you were wondering). That's probably the first time I've ever gone that fast, in fact I'm almost positive it is, and I got caught. I didn't even know I was going that fast, I just knew I was going the same speed as the four cars in front of me, and since I was the tail end, I got the ticket. I'm not really upset about getting the ticket, I deserved it, and the 5-0 was just doing his job, so I've got no beef with him. The only thing that really ticks me off is that now I won't be able to buy anybody anything for Christmas. So I'm a worthless fag of a friend. And by worthless fag, I mean a worthless straight guy of a friend. Not that there's anything wrong with that. So yes, my weekend, conveniently condensed for your reading pleasure. Stay shway, folks."

My anger about the gift thing is pretty much completely diminished, and I didn't have to do any real work that I can remember.I just got the Pixies album  Surfer Rosa, but I haven't had the chance to listen to it yet. I assume it's awesome, however, because when you're the Pixies, you just can't help it, can you? You don't know, cause you're not them, so shut up.I think for once I may be content without a girlfriend. I mean, it'd be nice to have one still, but I don't feel it's a necessity any longer. I'm over Steph, which wasn't a big deal at all once I discovered my reasons for likage, and I can't really afford one anyway. Joel and I agreed on a $50 cap for our gifts to each other, and a six month cap on how long we're willing to stay single before just getting it over with and going gay(but not really).
Heidi keeps trying to tell me I'm obsessive compulsive, because I like to use proper grammar. I'm beginning to believe her, now that I seriously think about it. I've never thought of myself as obsessive compulsive, and I've gotta say I don't entirely dislike the idea. I could totally use that as an excuse for a whole lotta crap.
You know in the movies, when you see the business guy walk into the coffee shop, and the girl behind the counter is all like ""Hey, John,"" and then John is all like ""Morning, Patricia. I'll just have the usual this morning. I can do that, because I'm a regular."" And upon calling himself a regular he places his fists upon his hips and thrusts his pelvis mightily forward, like a superhero out to save the world, one mortgage at a time. Am I the only one who thinks that is totally bad-A? I've gone to PJ's Coffee House at my lunch every work day so far, and I'm thinking about continuing to do so until I'm a regular. I'm not sure what the minimum elapsed time is that is no doubt required to be considered a regular, but I'm pretty sure from my extensive movie-containing-important-businessmen-who-also-happen-to-be-regulars-at-the-local-coffee-shop viewing that you have to be on a first name basis with the workers, and as such, I'm going to try and figure out a way to get the girls' names who work there, and also to find myself a regular drink, so I can have one of those too. The girls that work there are really nice, the kind you can just look at and want to hug and befriend.
My tongue really hurts. I've got those little lie bump thingies on it. Y'know, where like a single taste bud gets all swollen for some reason or another? That, but on like twelve of them. Sophia hadn't the slightest what I was talking about, so I'm starting to think I have tongue-pox or something. Be sure to let me know if you have ever experienced an ailment similar to this one, cause right now I feel kinda like a pioneer in the tongue-sickness world, and I don't like it. Pioneers never get the benefit of past experience and/or medications.

Yet here I am, wanting more than ever to curse and to break something. Stephanie freaking found out what I was going to get her for Christmas, which is the worst possible thing that could happen to me. Not because it's Steph, because I hold my Christmas gifts to people higher than just about anything. She doesn't want me to get it for her now, because she feels like it's too much money and because I'm giving it for the wrong reasons. First, eighty dollars is not too much money for one of my best friends. I mean, it's the same as when I got Paige that book of artwork by her favourite artist, or when I gave Charlie $800 worth of Nintendo 64 stuff. There's nothing I enjoy more than giving my friends the perfect gift, and this was the perfect gift. Second, I was not giving her the gift for the wrong reasons. My giving her this gift had nothing to do with me liking her, I was planning on getting it for her long before I started liking her, and after. I'm not sure at this point who really told her, I'm just pissed off all around right now. I know I shouldn't get this pissed about something like this, but this was going to be the highlight of my Christmas. I always give one of my friends one really good gift, and watching them open it is the best part of the whole season. Now I've got shit to look forward to. Night, and stay shway."

For God's sake, she's seasonal. I hope she quits and gets a better job somewhere, or something. Wow. I must be the gayest insulter ever, if that's the best I can come up with.

I found out that song I hate, ""This House Is Not A Home"", is by Three Days Grace, which sucks, because I thought I liked them. I don't know anything by them, but I thought at some point I'd heard them and liked it. Oh well, whether I did or not, they're still going to hell for making that song. Oh, speaking of crappy radio, my favourite Jet song is now on the radio, which ticks me off to no end. They seriously have like three songs from their album that aren't on the radio now, and it's only been out for like... a certain amount of months
When you were a kid, you know how you picked stuff up in a store, and when your mom said you couldn't have it, you'd just put it anywhere? Well I hate you. Oh, I know, ""That's their job,"" right? Well you don't have to make it harder, A-hole. And, as the great Forrest Gump once so eloquently put it, that's all I have to say about that.
I figured out why I like Steph, which is fantastic, because that means I can probably get over her pretty quick now. I also figured out why men have nipples, but I'm keeping the answers to both of these questions my secret. Now I konw you're scared, and this post has been shorter than those previous, not to mention less organized, but I'm pooped(as Howard Dean would say), so I'm off to bed. Stay shway."

"event","Good God y'all, that man can sing. I was debating putting Nat King Cole's ""chestnuts Roasting Over an Open Fire"" as my music, but the thought of putting a christmas carol there was just too much to bear. The point remains, though, the man can sing.
     While we're(I'm) on the subject of music, you know what song isn't good. That ""This House is Not A Home"" song that seems to be so popular on the radio lately. I believe that's the name of it, anyway. For those of you who may like this song, I beg you to reexamine the lyrics, and realize the error of your ways. While I'm strictly against entering lyrics into one's live journal, because just putting lyrics is ya know, not a journal, I think this time it's necessary to further drive home the point of just how awesome and deep this song's lyrics are:

                          By the time you get home, I'm already stoned
                          You turn off the T.V., and you yell at me(!)
                          I can hardly wait, for you to get off my case

     Now that, my friends, is expert lyricism. I'd like to meet the man who who wrote that poetry of the ages. Let's review:  ""By the time you get home, I'm already stoned."" Now to me, this is showing the writer's true courage, his readiness to stand up and say ""I'm not afraid to say that I get stoned. Who are you to tell me what I should or shouldn't use to help me forget about all my problems?"" Alright, next. ""You turn off the T.V., and you yell at me."" Now here, the writer bonds with the listener while at the same time showing how hard his life really is. Who hasn't been yelled at at one time or another? And upon realizing his girlfriend turns off his nightly viewing of ""The Apprentice"" just to tell him to stop making crappy music and get a job, the mystery of this fiery enigma that is the writer begins to unravel, and we understand a little better just how difficult he really has it. ""I can hardly wait, for you to get off my case."" Perfectly natural, right? WRONG. Here he shows his infinite patience for this girl. She's all up on his case, yet he just manages to hold on to some patience, and calmly waits for her to get off of it, but at her own pace. Now there is the mark of a true man.
     Going on to a new subject, work today was much better than before. We weren't exactly the busiest of department stores, so I spent most of the time zoning E, which isn't so bad, considering a couple of the other nubs got d(Domestics) and F(softline[clothes]). God, I hate softline. Dig this, though; I got them to schedule me for tomorrow, so my paycheck will be that much bigger, which is good, considering it's my only paycheck before Christmas.
     I had a strange dream last night, concerning someone I used to like, and I dreamed she was telling me she liked me, which probably means I secretly want her to like me, which probably means I secretly like her still, which sucks, because I hate liking people. Especially when they're waaaaaaay out of my league. But it's all gravy, because I've come up with a solution to all my problems.
     I have decided that I want a girlfriend fro Christmas. I'm accepting applicants now, so if you'd like to apply, just comment on this post, and include things about yourself I might want to know. Make sure to keep it interesting, because I'm expecting a plethora of comments(at least), and you don't want to get lost in the flood.
     Well, my adoring fans, I'm off to sleep yet again. Send requests for personal appearances or signed photographs to 1600 Nah Lane, Slidell, Louisiana. Oh yeah, and stay shway."

"event","Alright, so dig this. I go to school today, expecting everyone to rejoice upon seeing me, the girls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              flocking around my newfound gorgeousness, asking themselves how they hadn't seen my potential before, and beating each other to be the first to giggle and bat their eyes at me. Now while this actually isn't too far off from the truth in a couple cases(Kelly, Jordan, and of course, Lisa), for the most part the people's reactions, while certainly strong, weren't of the flirtatious sort. The few who actually liked the change were of the attitude of ""Oh, you got less ugly!""(the previously mentioned girls included). Not that it matters, because who cares what other people think, right? I'm starting to become less sure of that. While I'm yet to actually regret the change, I worry my self esteem may be affected when rather than just reject me upon being asked out, girls begin to reject me upon the request that they join my group for a class project, or share a bite of a toaster pastry. And I don't know what I'll do if my free food supply is discontinued.
     I think I'd like to hang out with Jordan sometime. Not romantically or anything, just hang out with her. She's really one of the coolest girls I've met in a really long time. Of course, that's never going to happen, because I asked her out a couple months ago, so now if I were to make any attempt to hang out with her, even platonically, she'd probably suspect some hidden agenda. I guess it's for the best, though, because if I became good friends with her, I'd end up falling for her anyway, and we have way too much in common already. Blah.
     You know who's awesome? No, you don't, so why don't you shut up and let me tell you? My cousin Natalie, that's who. I give her a tough time, and make fun of her when I really should be all concerned about her and crap, but that's just because I'm a jerk. Really though, she reminds me a lot of myself, which makes her awesome enough in itself, plus she lives in New Jersey, and I know if I lived there for more than three months, I'd probably end up abandoning my whole moral system, which is actually not as bad as you'd think. Anyway, I really respect her for all that, but the real thing is that she's really a genuinely awesome person, the kind who'll actually listen to what you have to say and not just be pretending to care. If only she lived a little closer to me(and by a little I mean a lot), I'm pretty sure she'd be one of my best friends, and for once I'd have one I didn't have to worry about falling for. As it is, I think I think much higher of her than she does of me, and deservedly so.
     I'm watching Fahrenheit 9/11, and I've got to say I'm a little disappointed. I don't really have much against Bush, but I've always liked Michael Moore, and was expecting more concrete evidence and less far-fetched guesswork out of this. I'm sure he has good reason to hate Bush and all, but it seems like he just tried to create a conspiracy theory in time for the reelection. Shame, really.
     Anyway, I think I'm up for a bowl of cereal, then I'm gonna play XIII for a little bit. Au revoir, my dearest fans(there are so many of you, I know), and as always, stay shway."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went to church this morning, that was
good. More people commented on how my head mysteriously seems to have
lost its fur. I never thought about it, but I guess it's one of my pet
peeves when someone gets six inches lopped off their scalp, and the
next time people see them, they still say, ""Oh, you got your hair cut?""
It amazes me the trouble people will go through to make sure they don't
sound too sure of themselves nowadays. All the invisible question marks
and parenthetical ""y'know""s people slip into their speech lately really
get to me. By the way, that whole uncertainty thing was stolen directly
from the mouth of an old def poet. But anyway, yeah, I went to church,
and then after church I brought Joe and Alex over to Matt's to do our
Greek Mythology project.&nbsp; We ended up going back to the church to
use all their crap to film the skit, and made it a puppet show because,
if there's anything Team America taught us, it's that there's nothing
that can't be made funnier with puppets. Naked puppets. Anyway, the
story of Arachne has never been more entertaining, or less Greek. Steph
wouldn't come and help us, nor would Joel, probably because they're
both fags and were too busy having sex with their cats or something.
God, I hope I'm way off on that one. Actually, I believe were the
excuses were ""I'm at work"" and ""I'm going with Billy to his nephews
birthday party"", respectively. Oh yeah, real convincing, Joel. So we
got the project filmed and everything, so now all we have to do is edit
it. Oh yeah, the most awesome thing about it: for the credits, it's
going to be each of us respectively dancing with one of those dancing
hamsters, and then me coming from offscreen and drop kicking them. Soo
bad A. I mean, come on, what's cooler than&nbsp; drop kicking?
Headbutting, that's what, but that'd be too painful on the part of the
recipients, so we had to go for drop kicking, which comes in a close
second. After we finished filming, we realized how computer illiterate
we all really are, and decided to work on the editing Tuesday(on which
I have work, so I guess it'll be just them editing it. I didn't tell
them that, though). Them I came home, and dear God my room smelled bad.
Okay, not ""dear God"" bad, but a good ""geeze"" bad, probably. So I
brought&nbsp; all my dirty clothes to the laundry ""where they should've
been in the first place"". Hahaha, I just realized the true beauty of
the livejournal. This is possibly the only place in the world aside
from nazi Germany that I can write about my dirty clothes, and people
will actually read it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a little worried about tomorrow at school.
I mean, so far everyone's said they liked my hair for the most part,
but that's mostly family, and they're chronic liars. All families are.
So tomorrow I find out what the world really thinks about my hair. Not
that it really matters, I like it, but it'd be nice for others to not
think I'm hideous. No worries though, I'm sure it'll be fine. Geeze,
did I really just say no worries? Where the crap did I get that from?
Be sure to comment and tell me if you know, that's not a rhetorical
question.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work Tuesday. I really wish they'd scheduled
me to work more this week, my only paycheck before Christmas is going
to be dissapointingly dismal. A lot of my friends are going to have to
wait and get their gifts a week late.&nbsp; I know what I'm getting
Joel, and while it's not exactly the most expensive thing, I know he'll
like it a lot. I know what I'm getting Steph too, but in case she's
reading this, it's gonna be a crappy gift that she'll hate. A..and so
will Joel's. Especially Joel's. In fact, scratch that whole&nbsp; him
liking it thing, he's gonna hate it. Hate it times two, in fact. That's
how much it sucks. Alright, now that I threw them off my trail, I'll
talk about something else. The only thing is, I can't think of anything
else to talk about, so I guess that'll be have to be enough for
tonight. Sleep well, everyone, and as always, stay shway.<br>"

"event","So this is my first entry, eh? Not too impressive so far, if you ask me. So I'm just supposed to write about whatever's going on in my life, and random people who have no idea who I am, but who also have nothing better to do(no offense, I'm one of them) will read my little stories in order to further depress themselves? I assume the answer to that question is yes, otherwise I'm writing to the wrong audience, which, as on-level english teaches us, is strictly against the rules. Alright, so on to the crap you don't really want to, but came to read. 
    I got my hair cut today. Everyone I told seemed to get mad at me for some reason(except for Steph, but I'll get to that in a sec). I'm not sure what their beef is, it's my hair, but for some reason everyone seems to have some kind of stock in it. Ah well, I like it anyway. That's another thing, none of them have even seen it yet, and yet they're all ready to assume it made me even uglier. Except Stephanie, my one friend ready to give me the benefit of the doubt. Oh yeah, the deal with Steph, for you first timers. She's one of my best friends, my best friend, actually. I can have two. One male and one female. Joel and Stephanie. Only problem is, I like her. I started liking her sometime last summer, liked her a lot for a little while, then got over it like a smart kid would. I always do this, though. I like a girl, get over her, and then start to like her again. I don't know what it is with me, it's like I have to start liking them a second time, y'know, give them one last chance to like me back. Anyway, my rebound attraction with Stephanie started about a week ago now, I guess. It's a terrible thing, really. I mean, it's not like I don't know why I'm attracted to her, I do, she's pretty much the perfect girl. Not perfect in the sense that I'm so starstruck that I can't see her flaws, I don't like her nearly that much. I mean like perfectly compatible with me. That's the problem with the situation, though, we're so compatible we've got this awesome friendship I wouldn't give up for anything, so I'm not wanting to screw it up. Plus, it's not like she just doesn't dig me, I'm too much like a brother to her is all. I know she cares about me a lot(she'd better anyway), which makes it even more annoying that I like her. That's just another inconvenience that I've gotta struggle to stop from becoming an obstacle to our friendship. Luckily for both of us, I don't like her nearly as much the second time around, so with any luck I'll be over her before Christmas.
     I think I was on a concrete subject somewhere up there, but I lost it a while back, and lack the energy to seek it out again, so I'm gonna go to a new one. I've been practicing my cursing a little lately. The realization that I needed to do this came to me when I tried to curse in the shower the other day and couldn't do it. I honest to God could not curse. You see, I haven't habitually cursed in about three years now, so I've trained myself out of it so well that when it comes down to actually attempting to vocalize one of those long-forgotten dirty words, my mouth literally wouldn't allow itself to form the word. Upon realizing this, I knew that immediate action must be taken, so I got Jocelyn and Kelly in fifth hour to coach me into saying them again. It took a good twenty minutes to get s**t out, and the f word followed another fifteen minutes or so later. I'm still not completely comfortable with them, which is good, because I don't want to start overusing them. It's just good to know I can use them now if I really need to.
    Alright, well I think that's enough writing for one day's post, so good night all, and stay shway."

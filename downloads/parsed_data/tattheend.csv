"event","today started off pretty well. i finally slept in til after 9, read 2 lessons for ISS, and then laid outside for a decent amount of time. i even went into the pool. it's still freezing, so i only stood in the shallow end, but i did go in - quite excited for when it's warm enough to go under.&nbsp; after that, finished watching a bronx tale...the lock test, it's a good rule to live by.&nbsp; during this came the bad. i heard cats screaming outside so i went to investigate.&nbsp; i looked out the back door and saw linus and hoovie; i stepped out and saw bob having a stand off with some gray cat. linus looked freaked out. so i ran and grabbed bob before he got the crap beat out of him. linus followed us inside. i sat&nbsp; down to calm bob down and out of nowhere linus runs up and jumps on my leg. i think about all of his claws and teeth dug into my skin. that was the first time in a while that i have screamed out of pure pain....and andrea says he has gotten nicer.

i thought i was just going to spend the night cleaning and doing yoga, but then my phone rang. oh how i really hate catching up with people i've never really liked.&nbsp; of course i was nice and went over (mistake). i got to sit there awkwardly in the basement with people i really don't know. then came the worst part. i sat there for about 20 minutes well she drunkenly told me her sob story about her exboyfriend.&nbsp; i had to bite my lip from laughing; it was like she was auditioning for the next lifetime movie. the whole time i just wanted to scream out ""you're an idiot!"". you would think that breaking up and getting back together twice within a couple months would have been a big enough warning that it wasn't going to last, but apparently not. girls are dumb bitches.

honestlly, most guys aren't that much better, but girls are just complete idiots, especially when it comes to relationships.&nbsp; the amount of girls i know whose lives have been worsened by bad relationships is way too high.&nbsp; in general, i really don't like most girls; they have way too many issues. i can get along with pretty much everyone, but so often i'll just sit there trying desperately to hide my annoyance and just smile and nod.&nbsp; i always have valid reasons for why i don't like people. i try not to judge people off of first impressions. i really like when people don't fit stereotypes that most other people would categorize them in.

i find it amusing but also quite idiotic that the only reason i have ever known for&nbsp;girls to not like me is because i am friends with their boyfriend&nbsp;or the guy they like.&nbsp; adam's ex makes me laugh with how much anymosity she has towards me. i've never even met the girl, but she hates me.&nbsp; and the one from the japan trip. i honestly thought we could have been friends; we seemed to have similiar interests. but she liked him and he liked me so she hates me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","who would of thought that i would be excited when emerald told me that she is going to kansas state.  i'm sure i'll miss her next year but it should be fun to finally do things completely on my own. right now i feel like emerald and i are headed in the same direction as andrea and amber went.  hopefully evie will be going to state next year; i think i get along with her better right now; we both seem to have the same attitude towards people. we may not like or agree with everyone, but we try to make the best of it. with emerald most of the time, i always feel like i'm secluding myself from everyone else.  i think that's part of the reason for why she is constantly depressed. maybe getting far away from everything will be good for her, but a large part of me doesn't think she'll last there.  she is so close with her family that moving away from them may send her into an even deeper depression. i'm not trying to sound like a complete bitch, but this is the girl whose parents made a rule that she can't watch christmas movies until advent starts, and whats stranger, is that she follows it.  ahh, but who knows.  once she learns not to take everything so damn personally, i think she'll be a lot happier.  on a happier note, i'm getting paid 20 bucks an hour to tutor a kid in math and english.  it was bad though today when i was helping him with english and i had to look up some things.  sunday i'm going to some honors college visitation at state. i'm not sure why i'm going, and with my luck i'll probably get stuck with another girl who won't talk to me.  maybe i'll just sneak off and crash at andrea's for the night.  there's 55 days til christmas, 61 til 2006 and 87 til i'm a legal adult. this also means there's about 80 more days until i quit the horrid cine (though my parents keep reminding me how expensive it will be for all my traveling i want to do).  it seems my life is heading toward the upside, and so hopefully that means that (possible/unsure/confusing) mike thing will pass, but saturday may be quite awkward.  well my feet have grown tired and my eyes a little wired and i don't know what to to so i guess i'll retire...but just remember you can lose all your money, lose all your gold, but you can never lose your heat and no one can take your soul!....ahh oar, how i love and miss thee....good times"

"event","i knew i wouldn't write in this too often, so here is a brief review of the past month or so.
like pretty much everyone else in their junior year, i took the ACT; surprisingly i fucking kicked ass. jopefully now with my score and gpa i will get a decent amount of money in scholarships. i was in kapers again...lots of fun minus the julia being there part.  she is probably one of the few people that i completely dislike. sometime in april, emerald and i went to jeff's house and met some kids from west....have to say they are a lot easier to get a long with than kids from east.  as of today, i completed my stress-causing, sleep-depriving, bitch of a research paper for english (the evolution of crime and punishment in the US)....i think i should get extra credit for all the hours i worked on it and the number of sources i had. emerald and i also finally got to mess up someone's car (kevin's w/ pb&j). it wasn't the best job but a good start. i got elected as VP for key club next year, which makes me emerald's bitch, so it should be fun.  a small group of us skipped prom and went to dinner, played in the park, saw a movie, and played in the park again; overall i think i had a better time doing that if i would have gone to prom.  we went to laura's after...most of the guys go their hair curled and greg licked ben's foot (insert gagging noise here).  i bought OAR tix...ben somehow managed to get seats near us so it should be sweet.  i get to be an honor marshal (or whatever its called)...good for college apps. but bad for my feet and boredom level.  i got 3rd in at the math/sci for chem which was pretty surprising. this past weekend i went to canada for a leadership conference, it was fucking awesome. everyone was super cool and we (the red) got along great. i forgot half the people's names but hopefully once i get my pix developed and email them a couple of times i can figure them out.  i know there's a lot of other things that happened but im too tired to remember (ha...the psychic was right). my goal for the week (maybe a little longer) convince the parental units to let me go to europe with andrea."

"event","as like so many nights before (and to come), i was thinking about the future.  the closer i get to finally leaving this hell hole of a town, the more nervous i become; for what reason i do not know.  i think all the uncertainty just scares the hell out of me, but i can't wait for it to come.  i've had my fill of the whole high school thing, it's so damn repetitive. i hate that best part of my week is hanging out with emerald and complaining about how everything sucks.  and then there is the whole college thing i keep thinking about; i know which one i want to go to and getting in shouldn't be a problem, but i fear that i will resort back to being the ""shy and quiet"" one again without being surrounded by people i know.  god, i hope that doesn't happen, i hated being like that. and if emerald and i did end up going to the same college, would that be a good thing or would a turn out like andrea and amber-barely speaking to each other even though they live together.  i know i should get a job but i don't want to end up like andrea, always stressed out and sick.  for as much as i'm scared to grow up, i wish it could be 3 years from now so i wouldn't have to deal with these stupid teenage problems; they're so trivial but i'm always worrying about them.  i think i just need to go to sleep before i have a complete meltdown."

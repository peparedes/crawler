I wake up at 4am and go to school until 3pm, after that I get back to the squadron and do a 4 mile run, sit ups, and push ups.  Then I get the rest of the day off.

  Anyways after the movie's went to Waffle House and talked with Aaron for about 2 hours.  I am very proud of him for trying to get out of this Sara situation.  But I am jealous that he can hang out and talk with his ex.  I wish it could be that easy for me but some of my ex's, on the other hand I know how some of them are and I really don't give a shit anymore.  It is sad that it had to be this way with some of them, but it just makes me angry that they would hide shit from me, when I don't give a rat's ass anymore.  Well that will end my rant, oh and this isn't pointed at one person but a couple of people.

  My weekend was sooooooo AWESOME!!  First at work Friday I had a mystery shopper and I ended up getting a 93, so the big guy congratulated me and said that I was going to the McDonald's competition.  So Saturday I went to the competition (It put all the best workers from 10 different stores making a quote ""Super McDonald's"".....Sam said that)  I got my results today and I came in first in my area which was Order Taker for Drive Thru.  So now the people who won in there area's are now going to compete against Corporate McDonald's for a shot at 500 Dollars, for each person.

  Also Saturday night was sooooooooo much fun.  It was Joe's birthday and well I really don't remember too much of it.  I don't get drunk very ofter, but I did promise him that would at his party.  I did regret it Sunday morning but it was a fun night.  But I found out that I am a very emotional drunk.  I started to cry when Aaron left the room cause I thought that I made him angry and he left, and then 5 minutes later I was angry at Brad D. for not being drunk like I was.

Anyway it is about time that I head to bed for I worked 11 hours today and I open tomorrow.  So Good Night Everyone!!"

  Needless to say I haven't done a whole lot this week.  Work yesterday was say that I should not go in the military and I could be a manager in a couple of weeks......which I kindly say no thanks,  Arby's tried that with me too.  Well 2 days ago all the managers had a meeting and I ran the store with one manager who was in the back doing paper work the whole time.  I opened yesterday without a manager cause they gave me a key to the store.

Ok so one night I decide to hang out with some people from work.  I go to Mike's house and meet up with Taco and Wade, they are just chillin, talkin, and having a good time.  They want me to drink and I say ""naw I'm good"".  Later on they decide hey lets go to a bar I figured I would be the driver for them since none of them were fit to (except, maybe Taco).  I go there and I end up drinking two drinks (not harmful, didn't even have a buzz)  Well that was the end of the night for me and I went home.  Well today apparently Mike is gay.....so he was trying to get me drunk and have his way with me, so when I said no to getting drunk and staying longer, he went for Wade who told me that Taco had to keep Mike away from him.  Basically he was sleeping and Mike tried taking him to the other bedroom.

Anyway it just made my brain hurt today.  I don't think I will be hanging out with him anymore."

Saw soo many good bands.  There was MxPx, Thrice, Transplants, Offsping, and many more.  My favorite is between Transplants and Thrice.  It was soo hot all day and it finally rained when Fall Out Boy played.  During Offspring I got involved in a moshpit, fun except for being kicked and punched in the face.  Other than that I had a blast.

I walked in and Andy came up to me handed me two shirts and told me to fill out all my info down.  So I start work tomorrow and I am working from 8-4pm. and am getting 6 dollars an hour.  =)

  He also said that he would give me hours!!

  Also my Dad showed up in town......very odd.  So he took me and bought me new pants and shoes for work.  Well I think I will go.

Peace Out!!"

  Moving on to today's event.....guess what?  I GOT FIRED TODAY!!!  I don't know what to do.  Things just keep getting worse and worse.  Things at home are doing very bad, blah, blah, blah.  Point is I don't have purpose for doing much right now, I just want to hurry up and get on with my real career.

"event","Ok, ok, ok.  A couple of days ago I had one weird day.  First off I was climbing up on to one of the shelves to get some cups and when I jumped down my right shoe blew up!  Then later that day I was grabbing soda from my manager's car and my pants ripped down the crotch area.  Yeah I thought it was funny so I figured I would share with part of the world.

  Today was cool, went to work....yada, yada, yada.  After work I chilled at home until Joe got here and then Stephanie got here and we all went to Leni's house and played phase 10.  (I won, Yes!)  Finally Joe and I went cruising down the Summerville area.

Any who I am going to bed!

Peace Out!"

He darted out of the bathroom and told everyone he seemed scared.  I laughed, and so did everyone else.  That was his first time catching that happening.  Anyways the new Steak Wrap and Peanut Butter Cup shake is Awsome!  Yesterday I played paintball....not too long though, I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  Well that is all for now.

"event","""Sex is the Attic""

  Today I worked all day until about 7:30pm.  There was an old lady about 70 something, her car wasn't working cause it overheated and she didn't have any water.  So I went out to her car and helped her out.  I told her that I didn't want a reward for helping but she used her power of seniority over me.  Damn the elderly!!  Anyways right after that I went and saw Cory at Hess, he then offered me his sausage.....I mean a hotdog.  Stephanie showed up and we all just talked for a while.  After that I went home for a little until I got a call on my phone.  Stephanie wanted to hang out and I was like sure (even though we already planned on doing that).  I said we should pick up Joe, so we did.  We went back to Hess and helped then close by keeping customers away.  Finally went to Joe's and watched Idol Hands, I am not done with it but I will finish it later.

  *side note*  I LOVE YOU GUYS!!

  Peace Out!"

Talk with Ryan online he then came and got me.  We didn't know what we were doing but as we were driving down the road we saw Sean Johnson, no fucking lie!  We both turned and was like was that Sean.  We turned around and met up with him.  We went to his house and then picked up Joe.  Went to the Arcade to bother Steve and play some DDR.  After that we went to the parking lot and met up with Bernie and Emily (haven't seen them in a while so that was cool).  Finally went went driving everywhere and met up with Kat in the Target parking lot, where we all sat down and talked for a while.  Ryan dropped me off and I then played some Halo and went to bed.

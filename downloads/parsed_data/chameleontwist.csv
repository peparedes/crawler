But that is okay because Maddy and I have totally been teaching the kids the most outstanding art of windsurfing on the lake!  They are a most enthusiastic group!  And one can breathe underwater which is excellent!!!! :D  Though it was most troubling when we thought he had like, died at the bottom of the lake.  Cha.  But he was totally still breathing and looking for this little dudette's bracelet.

Uhh..anyways!  It is time for me to depart and partake in the preparation of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!  Catch ya later, dudes!!"

"event","Woah!  First of all, I am most apologetic, Mrs. Ebonmaw!  For although I totally saved your life, I also percolated chameleon saliva upon your personage!  All over that totally bodacious top you were wearing!  Sorry.  I'll totally pay for the dry cleaning bill!

Second!  That was a most unusual hostage location!  Most villains take them to the top of skyscrapers or something!  But that was a totally reputable petting zoo, and I would like very much to re-visit at a time when lives are not in danger!  I totally wish I could have a pet duckling.  They are most adorable!!  But I already have what is now an excellently huge aquarium.  And I love my little sea dudes in a totally platonic buddy way!

Uhhh...oh yah!  Maddy!  You totally predicted that the tiny lamb would bring about my downfall!  And I TOTALLY slipped on it's crap and landed on my butt! :D  Cha.  That was downfall-bringing indeed.

Also DUDE!  Tony got HUGE, dude!  Like...duuuuude.  Excellent!  I totally hope he manages to change back though because like, bummer.

Also, it is somewhat sweet that Debbie and Mr. D enjoy each other!!  However that must be most awkward for Casey and Quentin!  Maybe.  Yah.

Uhhhhh...so excellent job once again, comrades! :D  Those villains need to like, learn to be good at fighting or something.  Only not because then we might lose.  Hahaha!"

"event","H'okay so last night, yah? My most resplendently beautiful girlfriend Maddy and myself went to a totally excellent seafood restaurant!&nbsp; And I was like ""Woah, I am most definitely in the mood for lobster!"" and the waiter was all ""Good choice, sir!"" and I was like ""Oh! Thank you, waiter dude!"" and then he goes away and he comes back with a LIVING LOBSTER. And the lobster is all ""Hey dude! I'm a totally alive lobster! Look at my cute claws all wiggling."" and I was like ""NO WAY! Well now we're practically buddies! D:"" And buds do not eat buds, dude!! 

So Maddy and I SAVED the lobster dude and all HIS buddies and now they are free! :D It was a most triumphant day for lobsterkind! And for us, too. Cha. So then we went and ate something totally vegetarian. Except I think it had chicken in it. 

Anyways! I am not so fond of the city! I mean yah the buildings are fun to climb and stuff, but I totally miss the ocean! When we get back, I am going on a most enlivened surf-a-thon! :D"

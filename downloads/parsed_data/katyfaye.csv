"event","<br />Greetings from Trianna, Server 39, Evonyonline <br /><br />A few months ago a friend of mine told me about a new game he was playing on line, he sent me the url for the server he was on and I logged on to check it out. I have been playing ever since. It's a browser based MMORPG, so you don't have to download anything to play it and you can play it from any computer. Evony is free to play, you can buy coins to get stuff more quickly, but most thing can be acquired through battle or by spinning the wheel (you get one free spin everyday) and some things can only be acquired on the wheel.<br /><br />I would like for everyone to join me on server 39, I need more alliance members! LOL. Click this link to sign up <a href=""http://fadiekay.evony.com"">Evony </a>&nbsp;Once you're there, register then you will go to the home page. Select server 39 (cause you want to play with me) and click play now. A screen will come up allowing you to choose the sex and name you want to play. On the map click Moravia or Burgundy (cause those are the states my alliance is is, and you KNOW you want to play with me) On your flag put OUTS (if you are joining my alliance, if not put whatever you like), and make up any old city name, hit paly now and you're in. <br /><br />Once you are in the game you can't be attacked for 7 days, so we are going to have to get you built up quick :) If you're playing on server 39 (come on play with me) then drop me a mail and I will tell you exactly what to do to get built up fast. If you chose to play on a different server then use this link <a href=""http://www.evonypedia.com/evony/getting-started/quick-start-guide"">Evonypedia Quick Start Guide</a>&nbsp;It's very helpful, but&nbsp;it does get a couple of things&nbsp;wrong (mostly due to in game&nbsp;changes that have been made since it was published) The first&nbsp;is the food issue, food is not cheep on servers that have be up for a while, but stone is very cheep.&nbsp; So ignore the only one farm part. The second is that the packages it tells you to click the little icon for, now start off in your inventory. If you are following this guide MAKE&nbsp;SURE you turn in the quests when it says too.<br /><br />Bookmark both those sites and the server you will be playing on. It's a great game, I really love playing it and I'm on several hours everyday so I hope to see you in game soon."

"event","I haven't writen on here in a very long time, I forgot I&nbsp;had this in fact. There have been a lot of changes in my life since I last wrote on here. Rocky turned into everything he always said he hated, left me for a woman 10 years younger then me a month before my birth day. Jackass that he was, it turned out to be a good thing. 

I went through some very tough things after he left, depression, poverty and on and on. I had to move into my sisters basement, almost lost my children and just felt like my life was over. I gave up on relationships and decided to date and not get seriously involved with anyone ever again. I got a job that keept me moving all the time and droped a lot of weight (from a size 26 down to a 14), dated a lot of guys ranging in age from 26 to 54, and was feeling a lot better about myself everything was looking up.

Then I met Ron, I told him I didn't want a serious relationship but he refused to take no for an answer he is the most supportive man I have ever been with. I got a different job, then moved to South Caroling, then lost my job a couple of months ago. I start a new job Monday that pays well and includes an all utilities paid apartment as part of the deal so yay. 

So that is what has been happing in my life lately."

"event","Well I am not home from school for the summer.  It's been a while, so I will do my best to do an update thingy tonight.  First of all, still majoring in urban planning.  That is going over well so far.  Not up to much so far over the summer.  I'm looking for a job, but that subjects makes me mad right now.  I want an internship...but can't seem to find one, so i may have to go back to an old factory job, but who wants to do that.  Oh well, I guess we'll see what happens in the next week or so.  The first week off has been nice, especially just being able to relax!  

I recently found a new movie i like.  Music and Lyrics with Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore.  It's really good actually, suggest it to anyone out there..and the music is decent too! The song ""way back into love"" in it is amazing.  Still watching house as usual.  Only two episodes left in the season, sad to believe.  I have started watching heroes this year.  It is really good too.  I was hooked from the first episode, and i never really thought I would like it is the weird thing.  One of my buddies from school kept on nagging me about watching just one episode, so i finally did, and now i can't stop, i live for it week to week, just like i do with house.  October Road also is decent.  Although I don't know when it is on again, hopefully this week! (It wasn't on last week unfortunately).  

Anyway, I'm gonna keep this one short.  How is everyone else doing, i hope well.  Later."

This is also a Matchbox 20 song, but i'm not sure of the title....
""Someday you'll find your small town world in a big town avenue, going to make you like the way they talk when they're talking to you, going make you like the way they lie better than the truth, they'll tell you everything you wanted someone else to say, they're going to break your heart from what I see.. your just one more hand let down, cause no one tried to give you what you need... so lay all your troubles down, I am with you now.""

"event","Well the day is almost over.  Don't have much to say, but I had the time so I thought i'd post something.  It was great being with the family yesterday and today.  Had a pretty amazing christmas.  Got all the gifts I wanted and enjoyed play numerous amounts of cards...euchre and gin rummy are amazing!  

Having a break from school also is nice.... I'm planning on relaxing majorly tomorrow..maybe taking in a few episodes of house being that its not even on tuesday.... not back till the 9th of Janurary, so sad!  :(  

Kinda into lyrics again lately and their meanings.  Maybe i'll post some of them and my thoughts on them tomorrow...

Pretty excited for new years... althought I have yet to decide what i'm doing that night.  It's up in the air, i'll decide sometime soon....   Welp, i think that's about all i have for tonight. Goodnight."

"event","Well it's been a well over a long long time since i've last been on here.  Yes, i know it's bad.  I've spent so much time, too much time, working on school work.  Shoot, i guess somethings never change.  This past semester all in all went fairly well.  It's hard to believe its already finished.  Traveled alot, went to boston this past semester for an urban planning trip and it was amazing.  The city is truely a beauty.  

It's crazy that its already christmas too.... Time goes by way too fast.  This coming semester I'm going to try to spend less time worried about work and more time focused on life in general, and the beauty behind it all.  I am sometimes scared that I focus too much on school and that I'm missing out on somehting more grander, and larger, and more important.... 

It's good to be home too.  I got to hang out with some friends last night.  We went and saw We are Marshall.  Quite a decent show, kinda depressing at parts though....but the majority of really good movies are well depressing and sad.  Just as songs are the same way.  Its the type of saddness, depressing theme that hits more to you're heat and makes you reall ""feel"" more I guess that makes this type of material appealing in a way.  Anyway, the point that I was getting at wa that it was good being with friends from back home.  I hadnt seen some of them for a long time.  But college is great at the same time.  I am actually happy with my major of urban planning, a branch of architecture.  I love the work I am doing, and the people I get to see day after day, still there are days when its seems a part of me is still missing.  Sometimes I miss high school...but those are days when nothing goes well, and i think back to how great things seemed to have been then.  So much has changed now, but I guess it's all for the best because after all, some people come into your life for only a short time and they leave...that definitely proved true once high school finished.  

Definitely still have hooked on house.  Season three and its still going strong.  House is in jeopordy of getting arrested and having his license taking away.  I am confiendent though that it won't happen because where would the show go?  After all, if it ended I don't know what I would do.  It's been and will continue to be my tuesday escape for the world! I love it! 

Let's see...what else??... Music... still into the oldies, probabley always will be, but I'm happy with that and if you dont like the oldies thats okay, but understand that I do.  However, i've been introduced to some new stuff that is actually decent.  I'm a huge fan of hinder...might have mentioned that in some early posts though.  Also John Mayer's latest alubm contindium is amazing.  ""Slow Dancing in a Burning room"" is just an amazing song about a relationship that was doomed from the beginning.... I love the line, ""dont you think we  should we know by now, don't you think we should have learned somehow.""  The whole album is definitely worth the time its takes to listen to it.  Another song that I have been introduced to recently is entitled ""Konstinine"" by something corporate.  I'm not real familiar with something corporate but what i've heard i've liked.  But Konstinine is just amazing.  ""and if i hurt then i'm sorry, please dont think this have been easy on me.""...""did I tell you that I miss you, I miss you.""........ such a good song!  

I'm still single..but I think I'm okay with that right now.  I'm not in a hurry for anything right now.  I meet someone last year in studio.  We have become really close friends, and I suppose there is potential there for something, but i'm not sure.  I guess i'm still holding onto the past, and I know i need to let that go.  But I guess there are somethings that just aren't easy to let go of.  

Hmm... okay, i think that may be it for now.  Sorry it's so long, and probabley doesn't really ""flow"" well.  But it's nice to get it all off my head again.  :)  Talk to everyone later."

"event","Welp, definitely been a LONG LONG LONG time since i've last updated this thing.  I've had summer school this summer, and have been extremely busy with that, so I have very little time to do anything besides work on architecture stuff....but now I am done.  I hope to keep up with this thing, but I say that all the time, so I am not going to make any promises.  I've done basically nothing tonight other than think about life, the past, and the future.  I declared my major of urban planning this summer...and I think im gonna love it.  But I still think about the past and where this life of mine is leading.  I spent so much time working, that I think I miss out on so much sometimes.  Im too scared to tell anyone how I feel b/c I dont want friendships to fall through the ground. But the more I wait, the more I worry that Im not ever gonna have the chance to tell this person how I feel.  That really scares me.  College has been great though...really enjoying it.  This summer even has been fun except for the school part.  

Been into alot of different music lately, that which all suites the mood i've been in lately.  Was introduced to Hinder, and I like alot of their stuff.  ""By the Way"" is a GREAT song!!  I've also taken a liking to nickelback.  I love their new song ""Far Away.""  3 Door Down also is amazing.  Their song ""Here By Me"" is just amazing to me.  The song suites how I feel so perfectly.  ""Sorry I can't always can't find the words to say...Everything I'll ever know gets swept away...""....what a great line of lyrics!

Well that is all I got for now...talk to you all later. or if anyone is even reading this, thanks..."

"event","Well, it certainly has been a long time since i've last updated.  Been thinking alot lately about life, and where its going, the direction im taking and what not.  It's so confusing being in a phase of my life where things are constantly changing.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not afraid of change, heck, its even good for me in most cases...but it's like that once I went to college and espeically since i've gotten into my major of architecture that the chapter in my life that I called high school is closed, and gone from sight.  I've spent so much of my time doing architecture stuff, forming new relationships that in the middle of all that it seems that I've drifted away from old friendships.  Its like some people coming into our lives for a reason, for a particular staage of our lives.  Which really bugs me b/c i thought that the close friends i graduated with would always be close to me.  We were told u guys wont stay close like this, things change and people change.  But we told ourselves it would never happen to us, our friendships were much too strong.  I'm not saying that we never talk anymore, b/c that's not true...but it's impossible to say that nothing has changed between us.  I feel like i'm moving on, and it feels so weird.  it feels weird not seein them daily, not talking to them daily...but i guess that's just part of growing up.  College is where u are suppose to find your best friends, and I think that i've actually found some great people that i meet in my architecture studio......but i know that no matter what happens from the friendships in the past i'll never EVER forget those memories.....some of the best times of my life.  

As for relationships...that's another puzzling thing in my life right now.  It appears I'm still hanging onto the past...and seeking the future all at the same time.  And I dont know which was to go and what to do about it all.  It worries me so much that I have passed a perfect relationship up because i was too scared of what would come out of it, or it would be too hard to make it work......  But, while i've been at college this year, i've met someone else.  He's great, and I dont know what to do about it.  I like it, i like him alot....but i feel if i go into this..... i'm leaving something behind that i never got the chance to find out if it would work....and no matter what happens in my life, that will always be in the back of my mind.  But, i'm happy when i'm with this guy, i'm happy when i'm around him, and i feel that i can be myself and he likes that...and i like that.  But, deep down, i know that i'm always gonna wonder what could have been in the past...and i know that i need to stop looking back on the past and move on with my life.  Enjoy college life basically.

Anyway, that's about all I have to say.  Im not sure that anyone is reading any of this...but if u are, thanks, i appreciate the thought and concern! Talk to you all later."

"event","So, it definitely has been a while since I've updated this thing.  I confess I know I have been bad at this, and need to be better...but honestly, does anyone really read this, lol?  Well either way, its still nice to have a place to get all this stuff out at some point.  I'm on spring break this week, so just the time off has been worth it.  I'm busy like non other in architecture.  I hardly have any free time.  But its great.  Time flies by, but I am not sure I am that fond of that aspect of all this.  I mean this is college, this is is...and welll its gonna be over before i can even blink I fear.  I mean, high school...wow, seems like it was just yesterday, yes yesterday that I was in there.... w/all my best friends, having the time of my life...and a blink later, im here.... living my life, pursuing my dream...but what for...so that this thing we call college can be over with?  Is that what I really want?  I'm loving life right now... Don't get me wrong there are times when i miss the way it use to be...all the things w/ the best friends I could ask for, the friends I left behind in high school, that is what hurts when i think..and well 'thinking' just is not good for me, haha.  All I really want is to know that I have lived a full life, that I have lived it to the fullest...but what i fear is that I get so caught up in the every day life things that I have to do, that I am missign out on something....something great...... It's like this thing that I read some where..... what do you do when you just give up tryin to find the one you're lookign for..... you spend way to much time wasting time on all the wrong people that when the right one comes along... you are too woron out to even try and 'the one' just passes by, just like that...and the moment, the one chance u had, is all gone..... in just an instant..... that REALLY scares me.  Sometimes, I thin that I just need to step back and look at life from the outsider and not where i'm at...bc what if i am missing out on something?  I spend so much time doing the things that I ""have"" to do...that hte things I want to do, well, they never happen...and what if b/c of this my chance to find the one is gone...forever?  Scary thought I know.... I mean, this is the time, my prime...... but there is only one person I still have found...and I have no idea how he feels..... if its even close to how i feel.  So, i set back and do nothing, as usual..... and i know from past exeprience, that one day, i'm going to wake up, and that chance to be w/ this person will be gone. 

In the past couple of weeks I have also learned that for somethings...to keep it together you have to let it go....and maybe this is what i need to do with someone I care deeply about....b/c trying to stay friends and make this thing work just isnt working for me.  Maybe is best just to remember what once was..and be happy for that b/c God did bless me with that time..and I was in that time for a reason I believe...but now that part of my life is over...sometimes, I just think you have to more on...get on with you life...b/c if u don't, it'll leave you anyway.  So, i'm off... on this ride I call life... There will be curves, calm roads..and who know what ahead...but what i want ot know most of all, is that in the end.... it'll all add up, it'll all be worth while and everythign I have worked so hard for with pay off!  I'll be with someone I love, living where I wnat to..with a family..and the job of my dreams that I love.  I know the road is not going to be smooth or easy by any means....anything worth keeping never is.  

Welp, that's about all I have to say for tonight.... I""m going to try to be better with this thing...but no promises...... i have practically sold my soul to the studio! lol....talk to whoever is reading this later.... or if no one is reading this... it still felt good to get it out! bye bye."

"event","So, I got back to college today.  My roomie and I rolled back oto campus at about 2:30 and starting unpacking our stuff.  Took a while.... we brought ALOT home...but it's good to be back.  I have an 8 a.m. class in the morning, definitely not looking forward to it.  Have absolutely no idea how I will get up for it...somehow I will.  I'm glad to be bad, as i have said before...but not ready for the classes.  But I guess that comes w/ coming back.  I'll take what I can get I suppose.  We are thinking of rearrnaging our room perhaps... I think it'd be cool....we just gotta find the time! lol... Time...what a fun concept.  I'm afraid there isn't going to be enough of it this semester, haha.

I got my books today after I got back.  Freaking 7 books for one class.  Oh well, its my major.  All, i have to say is I best use every last one of them!!!!! lol.  Got the rest of my architecture supplies too.  Should be good to go tomorrow. 

Welp, I really don't have much more to say tonight.  SO, I'll just end it here.. Take care. Bye bye."

"event","Well tonight was an eventful night.  I went to the hospital w/ mom today to see dad.  It was good, kinda hard saying goodbye to him being that i leave tomorrow and he's still in the hospital.  But he's doing good and that is what is important.  Then, I got home early this evening and got to spend my last night home w/ my friends that were home too from college.  We went to a h.s. basketball team. It was fun, and a huge game.  The crowd was outstanding, i was truly amazed at all the people who were there.  I had fun just being w/ the girls hanging out and remember the old times we've had.  Then, after the game I had to come home and pack, yes PACK.  TO this moment right now I still am not done, not even done w/ the laundry.  Yes, i know this all is horrible.  But i'm getting there and i'll be ready by tomorrow when we leave, so it all good. 

I'm pretty tired, prolly should be going to bed shortly...but won't be for a while b/c of the packing situation.  Oh well, might as well get use to the late nights and early mornings again.  That's all i will prolly do it college.  But, after a while I just get use to it, so no biggy.  Well, I really don't have anything else to talk about, so i'm going to end it here.  Talk to you all later.  Bye bye."

"event","Wow, it is hard to believe that in two days i'll be back at college.  The break, wow, where has it gone?  Where does the time go?  I really have no clue.... time is passing by me soo quickly, I just don't know what to think of it all.  I like my life, i really do... i just wonder sometimes why something turn out the way they do?  Why we have to get hurt sometimes just to learn that one important lesson.  To learn about life, to love and grow.  IT just takes too much.  As this first semester has past by, so has part of my life.  And I ask myself, what do I have to show for it?  Yes, i got into the architecture program, and I am soo thankful for that, and always will be...but am i truly happy w/ the rest of my life?  That, I dont really have an answer too.  Sometimes, I feel that I get so caught up in doing hw and stuff like that at school, that I miss out on all the stuff inbetween, the college stuff.  It's like that Tom Petty quote says, ""the work never ends, but college does.""  I know i need to seize the moment and make the most of what time is given to me.  But it seems that as hard as i try, I can never do this.  I always keep telling myself that there'll be atleast one more day to do and tell that someone how I feel.  But ones of there days there won't be anymore days.  Now this can be taken in so many ways.  Death, or just the chance that passes by.  The chance that passes by seems to happen often to me.  You let something go for so long that after a while it's gone, the chance that is.  It's put simply in the song My Best Friend's Wedding.... you have to tell the person what you're feelign right then and there...tell them that you love them, that you can't live w/ out them, that you wannt be w/ them...b/c if you don't then the moment passes just like that and it's gone, forever!  Very sad concept to think about and even grasp.  I keep telling myself all of this, I just wish I could follow through w/ it...but I just don't know, it's not really me.  

Sometimes I wonder if a person can change or not.  I have reason to believe in both directions b/c i have seen people both change and stay the same....but I dont know... if you think someone changes you never really know for sure.  Some many people ""put on a face to meet those faces they meet""  What a sat situation!  If you can't be yourself around your friends who can you be yourself around?  I have 4 really close friends right now, and w/out them... I don't know if I could have made it.  They have been there through so much, and something tells me that they will still be around years from now, and that's something special i think.  I value our friendship and would do just about anything to keep it the way it is now...b/c it's simply great!  Absolutely amazaing.  Although, I fear change.  I've seen the change alreayd happen in some other friends, and in my opinion, this change was not at all for the better!  All I want is to be happy and loved, and in return loved as well.  And, I think I am atleast by my closest friends, and well of course my family.  If you don't alreayd know, I'm very close to my family...always have been and always will be.  They are greta people that really care about me and my personal well being.  There isn't much I wouldn't do for them! 

I watched a bunch of old episdoes (and still am wathcing them now) of ED.... What a wonderful show, almost as good as house... thankgoodness house came on air to take the place of ED...what would i have done?  Hmmm, don't have an answer, have no clue at all.  It's great to watch how Ed and Carol finally get together and how perfect for each other they were from the start of it all!  I love watching the old tapes i have of the show.  Like I said, almost .... ALMOST as good as HOUSE...but no quite...but still very good. 

Well, let's see...anything else new?  Hmmm....... not really, so i guess i'll end it here.  You all take care... Bye bye for now."

"event","Hey you all, I really have nothing to say...but feel like writing.  So, here it goes.  Went to the hospital again today w/ my mom to see dad.  He seems to be doing better, so that is good!  Been thinking a lot lately about life, and in particular where my life is going and what it's going to amount to when I get to where i'm going.... I mean, where am I going to life?  Who will I be with?  Kids?  Happy?  What will my family be like?  Will I be an architect?  What will my husbands job profession be?  Will I still be as close to the friends I am close to now?  These questions all have been boggling my mind for the past few hours.  I just wonder, wonder what will happen, where i'll be in 10 years.... It's a important question and one I am not really sure I can answer right now.  But, I still find myself trying to!  

I wonder when the right one will come along.  There's a part of me that thinks I have already found him, but I'm too scared at the moment to tell him how I truly feel.  Hmm, not really sure what to do there.  I'm really happy I have this to write in, I miss writing the journals I had to write for my publication courses in high school.  Those were great!  Definitely one thing I miss!  

It's currently after mid-night and I'm on here writing when I have to be up in like 5 hours.  yes, 5 hours. I have a lot to do and must get up VERY early.  Should be an interesting day though.  Can't believe I leave for school again on Sunday.  Time has flown bye over this break, very sadding actually.  I mean don't get me wrong, I am ready to go back to school, it's just that this time off has really been great.  The free of worry from school work has been just simply amazing.  Undescribable in some ways.  I can't wait to see everyone from bsu though.  It's been so long since I've seen most of them.  I have a busy schedule this next semester...very little free time and most of the free time I have will be spent working on studio projects most likely.  Anywhoo.... it shall be intriguing to say the least.  

Welp, while I could still write some more, I think I'm going to end it here... Need to be heading to bed soon.  The morning is definitely going to be coming way too soon for me.  Talk to you all later.  Bye bye."

"event","Last night was great... I got to hang out w/ my best friends!  We didn't do much, we were going to go bowling, but they didnt have open bowling that night, so we couldn't :(.... Oh well, it still was a fun night.  We ended up baking a cake that a friend brought over...made some guys go get the icing.  And when they got there I find out that one of them just broke w/ his girlfriend.  I didn't know how to take this.  He's a great friend, and always will be.  I'll always, no matter what, be there for him.  I use to like him alot and I still feel those feelings are past.  But I feel for him, b/c the way he liked his old girlfriend is the same way I like the guy I like.  I just don't know what to do about it all.  I fear so much that saying something will just mess it all up..and well, there is no way I could take that.  

As for the rest of my life.... I'm getting ready to go back to college soon.  It's crazy how fast this break has went.  The time off has been amazing.  But there is also a part of me that is ready to go back, to see everyone.  Well I suppose thats all I have to say for the time being... Can't think of much more.. Talk to you all later. Bye bye."

"event","Do things really happen for a reason?  Sometimes I think so, but I really don't know.  My dad took a fall the other day, and broke a few bones.  Is still in the hospital and prolly will be for a while.  And I've been going to the hospital each day w/ my mom to see him....but then, why would some people just go out, not even call me, and have fun.  I mean, yes, I prolly would not have been able to go...but just a text or a phone call asking me would be nice.  Maybe I am just over reacting to this but I really don't think I am.  

It's the new year...but it doesn't feel like it is new.  It's the same old shit that has always happened to me.  I mean I feel like I get dumped on so much sometimes and I feel like that tonight.  Why, I can't really say b/c I don't really know.  A part of me is ready to go back to school, while another part doesn't want to go back, doesn't want to deal w/ the work, the stress of it all.  But I have enough stress at home as it is right now.  I had so much planned for this week and didn't get to do much of it at all.  I'm still afraid to make that move and tell someone how I feel.  I just don't want to mess up what we have now, but I'm dying inside each day not letting him know how I really truly feel.  Well, maybe one of these days this year I can express these feelings.  I hope so atleast.  

Well I suppose I should hit the hay soon.... gotta get up early again tomorrow.  Welp, talk to you all later..Bye bye for now."

"event","So, I'm sitting here thinking about this past year and all that has happened.  The year soon will be over.  It's hard to believe.  I'm finished w/ high school and a semester of college already.  Where does the time go?  I honestly have no clue, and it scares me to death!  It's hard w/ time passing by so far and never having enough time to take the time to think about my life and see where it is going and see what is missing from it.  

Last night I was at a friends and watched an episode of Dawson's Creek....and in it it said ""there is something worse than a broken heart and that is love un-explored.""  That line really hit home last night.  B/c there are so many times that I want to tell someone how I feel, but I know deep down it would just make things complicated and may even ruin our friendship and I just don't think I could handle that.  But, every time I think about it, I find myself wondering what if something really could happen, what if i'm suppose to give this a try and I just keep on putting it off?  That thought really scares me, but still, still... I'm here, saying absolutely nothing.  I don't know if he feels the same, and the thought of rejection scares the hell out of me.  I want him, I like him alot, and there is not doubt in that....but I guess what I fear also is the fear of him becoming my ex-boyfriend.  B/c I know from personal experience that you can't be just friends with someone you've gone out w/ in the past.... it does not work.  But, what else does not work is being friends w/ someone, the guy, you have fallen for.  So, I have no idea what to do.  I just dont know how this can work out well.  The time I spend w/ this guy is great...but it hurts knowing that i'll never have him.  I keep on having the fear that he's gonna end up w/ a girlfriend that there will be no chance of us.... I dont know that I could handle that...

But anyway, I'm sure no one reading this really wants to hear all about this, so I'm going to end it here.  Talk to you all later.  Bye bye."

Tonight have been eventful.  Went out w/ a group of friends to see the producers.... And it was a pretty good movie too.  I enjoyed it and I enjoyed the time spent w/ my friends too.  I notice tonight that I really do have some amazing friends that care for me, and that means alot.  After the movie we went to stake and shake...great food!! 

I really don't have much to stay on here...but was bored and buy wasting some time away.  Been listening to all kinds of music lately... I really like Vince Gill's song ""Whenever You Come Around.""  It's really good, and in a way summarzies some of my feelings.  Sometimes, just sometimes it is hard to let that special someone know how you truly feel.  I love the lines, ""When you smile that smile my world turns upside down""..... Anyway, it's odd that I like this, b/c I'm really not a big country fan...but this song, it's not bad.

Well enough said, i'm gonna get off of here...talk to you all later...bye bye."

"event","Okay, so yes, it has been an awful long time since I've updated.  I assume that no one I use to talk to is even reading this anymore.  I told myself that once I went off to college that I wouldn't stop using this, but I guess that I did.... It saddens me to think that I have.  It's the one thing I have to let my feelings out on since I don't write journals much anymore.  But, oh well, I'm getting back into it now.  Let's see, I don't even know where to beign.  I guess college.

Well college is going great!  I've met soo many great people that are helping me have the time of my life and well that is what I am suppos to be doing, right?  It's college!! I'm thankful to say that my group of friends are still pretty close.  I mean its not like it use to be in high school, and i'm sure it'll never be that great again.  But a few of us still are close, and I'm thankful for that.  I guess that with college happening you really find out who your true friends are, and now I know.  There are four friends that I have that I have a feeling will always be there for me, and for that I'm thankful.  I try everyday at college to make new lasting friendships, and while I have made new friendships.... it's really hard to believe that I can ever find people that will be as close as the one I've made in high school.  People i've talked to say it will happen I just have to give it time, and while I do believe this... I just wish it would happen.  I guess I have met two friends that have the potential for being really lasting friends.  They are two people that I feel I could tell anything to, which is good b/c that is how I feel about my friends back home too.  

I've been into the old high school a couple of times since I set out on this new life of mine.  Everyone seems to be doing just fine, which is good.  I can't say that there aren't a few things that I miss from high school...but I guess I'll always miss these things.  I'm sure it'll be the same way once I'm finished with college.  I love the atmosphere of college and being on my own, but there is a part of me that misses the atmosphere of high school...the playfulness, and having no cares in the world.... I'm not saying that things were easy in high school...but there was less responsiblity put on me I guess.... But the point is that I LOVE college and am looking forward to this coming semester and years!  

It's christmas break right now and it's rocking!!! It's been great just being home and relaxing and hanging out w/ all my friends.  It's definitely what I needed after a long semester.  I got an early christmas gift on friday morning, I got accepted into the college of architecture and planning at bsu!!! It was a great feeling knowing that all the hard work i've put in finally did pay off!!! It was quite a relief I must say!  Finally, it seems like my life is set and going in a great direction.  I know what I want from life and where I want my life to go.  Just wish I could find that special someone.  I know he's out there somewhere.  I just hope I haven't met him and am letting him slip away right now b/c I just don't know if I could handle that.  If I am, if I could just get a sign, something to tell me to make a move that'd be great!  

I saw an awesome friend the other day at a near-by clothing store.... if you are by chance reading this my friend... it was great to see you after so long!!! I miss our long chats and the classes we had together.  Just give me a call sometime and we'll go into school.  Hope all is well with you, you seemed like everything was going great the other day.  And hey, thanks for getting me into this journal thing, I love it.  Sorry, I haven't kept up with it lately, I hope to do better in the future.  

I watched HOUSE tonight.  It was amazing as usual!  I absolutely love that show, and always will.  It was repeat tonight, it was the first episode of this season wtih LL Cool J as the convict.  It was really good though, but I guess I'd say that about any episode!  It really is a good show!  I can't wait till a new episode....wonder if anything is going to happen between stacy and house... I find that whole think interesting...and the tension between House and Cameron use to be good.... The show is such a mystery, I LOVE it!!! :)  

Well let's see, what else is there?  My music interest hasn't changed much.  Still heavily into the Beatles and that good ole 60's and 70's music.  Still love Pink Floyd and the wall.  I've recently been into some alternative music.  Still love Counting Crows....there is just something about their lyrics and melody of their songs, just love it.  Been into Jack Johnson a bit lately too... Let's see, still a big fan of Dashboard too, I suppose I always will be.

Oh, thought of some more tv stuff to talk about.  First of all, IDOL will be coming back in less than a month...can't wait for that!!! Maybe there'll be another Bo Bice...that'd be amazing!!! I really like that show and I'm not much for reality tv, but that show gets me hooked every season...  AND... on CBS starting the same night the IDOL does...there is a show called Love Monkey coming on for the first time.  It stars the main character from the old tv show ED (which, i too, was obsessed w/ a while ago...taped all of the seasons it was on...greta show)...and this show w/ ED is about music and love...what more can I ask for?  I'm sure I'm going to love it!!! So, i'm looking forward to it!  I also have gotten into Law and Order: SVU while away a college.  My roomie got me hooked on it... (thanks roomie :)  I love ya for it!)  

Well, let's see, I think that's all I have for now.  Yes, it was quite a long entry, but it has been a while since I've updated...and I really enjoyed writing it... Talk to you all, well if anyone is even reading this dumb thing, lol... Bye Bye."

"event","Wow, where do I begin?  Well I started college, got moved in and settled in.  Went really well actually, and I absolutely love it.  I am having the time of my life.  I have one of the best roomates ever, and i've made a ton of friends already.  High school was great and dont get me wrong, there are still parts of high school that I still miss...but college rocks.  I miss my friends from home though that I dont get to see much of anymore.  I feel that some of us are drifting apart and I dont know what to do about it.  The other day I met up with two friends that are now out of college and are still best friends from high school and did not go to the same college... to me that is just amazing.  That the kind of friendship that I want to have with my friends five years from now.  Is it possible?  Well, i'm not sure, I hope it is though. 

I like all of my classes for the most part.  They are pretty basic, but good.  I love the atomosphere of college, I love being on my own.  I love just living my life and having a great time.  It's great.  It's a undescrible feeling that well is going to be gone way to soon I fear.  As fast as high school went, I can only imagine how fast this chapter of my life will go.  I smile all the time when I think about the friends i've met and how great this year is going to be.  Yet, I wanna cry when I think back to leaving my old friends behind too.  I guess it's just a part of life.  I hope we all can stay close though.  Well that's all i have for now.  Talk to you all later.  Bye bye."

"event","Sometimes I wonder if all this life and drama is really worth it in the end.  I'd pretty much decided that dealing with all this stuff in my life was over with and that it wasn't worth it.  Why is that once you decide something like this, that something else comes along and makes you think twice.  I mean if people are going to change, I guess they change, nothing I can do about it expect just remember the good times and try and forget how hard these past few weeks have been, but it's not really possible when someone tries to talk to you.  It hurts so much more after you have already made up your mind that all this is over and done with.  I mean what are you to do?  I really don't know anymore.  I have so many mixed feelings on this.  And I'm pretty sure no one really cares, so I think I'm gonna just stop typing here.  I'll just leave it at this, bye all for now."

In a way, it reminds me of these feelings I've been having lately about going to college.  ""Good friends we've had, oh good friends we've lost along the way.  In this bright future, you can't forget your past.  So dry your tears I say.""  That's just amazing.  I mean, yes, people change (even close friends change) but sometimes its beeter to let these people go their own way and just remember the past for what it was and nothing more.  Sometimes patching things up can only makes things worse.  Remember it as a good time.

"event","Well I have tons on my mind tonight.  I went to a friends for dinner tonihgt.  It was great being with all my girls once again before we all leave.  I really needed that.  It was sad though knowing that in the next couple of weeks we are all going to go our separate ways and that for one things scares me so much.  I don't wanna loose what we have right now as friends.  It's something great that only happens a few times in a lifetime if we are lucky.  

Tongiht I watched this movie called Little Black Book with my mom.  When I found it, I was really wondering if it would even be worth watching.  Turns out it was REALLY good.  It started out with Carly Simon's song ""You're So Vein"" which I like to begin with.  The movie was basically about life and that sometimes planning life out only hurts you in the long run.  Even one of my favorite quotes was in it near the end that just fit perfectly with the movie.  ""Life happens while you are busy making other plans."" John Lennon.  To me, this quote is so true.  If you try and plan out you're hold live nothing, and I mean NOTHING will ever go the way it really is suppose to.  If you just let live take you, you might just find you get where you are suppose to be.  Which reminds me of yet another quote from the Rolling Stones.  ""You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you find, you get what you need.""  Just excellent.  Sometimes too much planning in the end is just a HUGE mistake.  Let life take you, it's a thrill and just know that you'll get where you need to be. 

Now, on to a slightly different subject.  Fear.  Why do people fear so many things, worry about some much stuff?  Yes, I know I am not one to talk at all.  But why do we do this?  If you think about it the amount of time we use out of our lives fearing something or worrying about something we have wasted years of our lives away.  Is that really worth it?  If we just believe that we are destined for something and just go with that we all should know that we are not alone and that we shouldn't waste a second of our lives worryies about this or that.  If you wannt to do something or say something, don't waste time thinking about it or what will happen after you say it, just say it.  Because if you don't chances are the moment will pass and then it's gone just like that.. forever.  Regrets are not good in this life.  So do what you can to live w/out them.  It's hard when that moment comes that you fear so much, but in the long run it is better to know what would have happened then to spend the rest of your life wondering, if something was possible here, or what would have come of this.  In reality, nothing may become of it, but IT IS better to know for sure that nothing would beocme of it.  (I hope that whoever reads this can understand what I mean by all this... It makes sense to me, but then again I am just rambling on.)

Well I suppose this is all I have to say.  Thanks to anyone who reads this.  Talk to you all later.  Bye bye."

Been working alot for the past couple of weeks, it's hard work...but what can you say the money is pretty good.  Can't wait for college.  Been getting all of our room stuff squared away.  It's going to be aweosme.  

Think I am gonna go look for a TV and a TV stand tomorrow for the room.  Can't wait for that.  I love to shop, so that will be fun.  Just a few more weeks till we leave and move in.  College is going to be so different, and so fun.  

Just one more week of work, so that is nice.  I don't really mind work all the much, its just that the hours suck when we have to work 10 hours a day.  But like I said, it's good money, so i guess it's worth it.  I'll be happy to have some free time though when I'm finished.  

I've really had a good time being on livejournal.  I'm real happy I got into this.  I've met some really cool people, and I love that.  Well I guess that's all I got for tonight.  Everyone take care and enjoy the rest of the weekend.  Bye bye."

I keep on giving and giving to people and it seems that I never get half returned, and honestly, I am sick of giving at the moment.  I put my heart on the line every time and it gets broken in half each time.  Maybe, if I just stop talking to people and just kept to myself things would be better, I would feel better I suppose to some degree.  All I want is for thing to go back to the way the use to be this last year of school.  I was happy then.  Don't get me wrong, I know I have a great life, I just miss everything from this year and I don't want any of it to chance and everything already has changed.  Each time I fall for someone I end up getting hurt and I can't handle it anymore. 

Everyone seems to be changing, and I hate it.  Each summer day is passing by and everyone is growing apart.  And I guess what I am saying is that it hurts inside so much.  I have invested so much time in all these past four years and for what, for it all to be thrown away now?  I don't see how that is even possible.  Well now I guess I am just rambling on now... but i need to get some of this stuff out for now.  Talk to you all later... (well if there is even anyone reading this)... Bye bye."

I haven't really been up to anything lately.  Thinking about life and the future, but that's not different from day to day.  Was disappointed that House wasn't on this week...:(.... but it'll be on next week, and Tuesday is getting closer with each passing day.  I just love that show. I heard a new song the other day.  It's called ""Home"" by Michael Buble.  It's actually really good with excellent lyrics. (And you all know I am all about the lyrics.)

I can't believe it is already July 13.  Where does the time go?  I mean each day another day passes and before we know it a year is gone and a decade is gone and we've lived over half our lives.  And I'm afraid when that time comes I'm going to look back on these days and say, wow, those were awesome days, I wish I could have hung on to them long.  But its like a song once said... ""there will be times when you want to hang on, but you got to let go.""  And as the stones once sang, ""You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you get what you need.""

"event","Well if there is one thing I've learned in my life, it is that if I am going to do something, I better do it then and there or else it will pass me by.  For example, if I have something to say to someone, I better say it now or the moment will pass and there it is, gone and in some cases forever.  Yes, this is a sad, but very true statement.  (This type of scene can be found in the movie, My Best Friend's Wedding where the best friend is in love with the groom and she has the moment, the time, to tell the guy that she loves him, but does she... No...and there it goes, the moment passed...  Time had passed and the chance that once was there is now gone.  This is how we all get regrets.  I have tried to live my life so that I have a limited number of these, but I must say, it is nearly impossible to live life w/ out regrets.  I mean there are these people we admire and love but do we ever tell them how much they mean to us?  NO, no, we just expect them to know, or for many we just say, oh...there is always tomorrow, i'll tell so and so how much they mean to me tomorrow...and then one day that tomorrow comes and they have died.  I dont want my life to be like this, I dont want regrets that make me lonely and wish that I could go back in time and change the way I lived certain moments. 

Also, on this topic, in house this week... Chase's dad came back and he said that if i dont expect him to be around and to call me or talk to me there is no disappointments. This is true, but in the end I think that we are missing the dance of life so to speak.  In garth brooks song ""The Dance"" he sings, ""I could have missed the pain, but I would have had to miss the dance.""  The dance is what life is, it's the memories the good times...however, to get to these good times, we have to endure pain... it is a part of life we all must deal with if we ever want to be happy.  When we dont expect some thing to happen there is no disappointments, but we miss everything that happens inbetween.  I guess it's the chance we each take.

Well i think i'll end it here, no need to expand anymore.  Just thought i'd let out what was on my mind.  Everyone take care.  Bye bye."

"event","This summer is passing just like all the other ones have, but for some reason, it feels as if something is missing.  Don't get me wrong, it's been a good summer, but it feels empty I guess.  Well, I guess, for starters I miss school, not the homework and stuff of course, but I do miss my friends.  I was so use to seeing so many people every day of my life and now it's life I only see those closer friends I have, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I miss everyone else.  Talking on here just isn't enough anymore like it use to be.  I want to go out and hang out with all of my friends.  I want to live these moments of my life and by not being with so many people everynight of my life I feel like I'm loosing something, wasting a small, but very significant part of my life.  

There is so many people I want to spent time with, and really talk to about life and what is going on with me and with them...but there never seems to be enough time.  So many people are just so busy doing different things from what I am doing that it's nearly impossible to even have a conversation anymore...and that saddens me.  So much is going to chance once I go to college.  And I know that I talk about this all the time, but it is how I feel.  I dont want to leave and come back a month or so later and found that either I have changed or the people I once knew have changed.  I know people are going to change...but I just dont want to loose my friendships that I have right now.  As the Pink Floyd song ""Time"" states it so well, ""And then one day you find ten years ten years have got behind you.""  I dont want to go off to college and go through it all and get started in a job and then one day think, wow, it's been ten years since high school... where has the time gone.  I wanna take these moments we get here and now and really live and cherish them.  

In the movie Can't Hardly Wait (yes, I know it's a little bit of a corny movie, but it has one good theme behind it) the viewer is told that fate only takes you so far and at some point it is up to you to make it happen.  For example, fate may open doors, but it is up to you (the person) to open that door.  I feel this is true.  Because while I do believe it fate, it does only take you so far.  This is why we have both good and bad days.  I tried to make up my mind at the beginning of this year to make the best out of fate and really live the moment.  For the most part I have, but I guess the one regret I have is not really realizing until it too late to really do what I want but to enjoy the little things that I have taken for granted, especially those little things about high school.  B/c now that I have graduated, they are gone.  

I am not sure if any of what I have wrote really makes sense to anyone.  But it feels good to just get it out I guess.  Thanks to anyone who took the time to read all this.  I really didn't have much to say tonight, but alot of talking basically about my life and all.  But thanks for reading it.  I think I'm gonna go now, I've typed enough for the time being.  Everyone take care.  Bye Bye.

Oh, okay... I thougth I was done, I was wrong.  I'm watching tv while typing this...and this commercial just came on and had the Five for Fighting song ""100 Years.""  Which I feel goes along with my little ranting tonight.  At 15 there is so many possiblities for life...but time just keeps on going on and each year just keeping getting shorter as Pink Floyd once put it in a song too.  And before long, the time is gone and well the song (and life) is over.  Before we know it half of our life will be over and while, yes, we maybe be wise...but will be all be happy with the life we had lived?  I hope so... or atleast for me, I hope I am.

Okay, now I am finished for the night.  Talk to you later.  Bye bye."

"event","Years pass and days go by and what do we have to make of them?  A job?  Money?  Is that it, is that all we really work for?  Don't we want happiness above all?  I know I do, but in today's society it seems that all we do is work for money, money, money.  That's all we want and sometimes it has taken over out own personal happiness.  

Mine keeps on flashing right before my eyes.  It is all going so fast and all I have to show for it is memories and pictures and I feel that all the years I've spent making friends and lasting relationships is going down the drain.  Once I go to college I fear that I am going to loost touch with so many of my friends and I dont know what I can do to make myself know that this won't happen.  I'm scared, and worried.  I know that we all will keep in touch, but never it will it ever be like it was.  It is already changing, I can already feel it.  

There is so much that I wanted to get accomplish in high school, so many things I wanted to do.  Some were accomplished, but I guess while I was going through my last year in school I never really understood that it was it.  This is all we have left.  I'm not coming back next year as a student.  I'll never be a student there again, and to me this is weird.  There is so much I am going to miss.  Don't get me wrong I am so pumped about college.  Me and my roomate are going to have a ton of fun together, but is it wrong to miss high school?  The fun of it all, the atmosphere, the close friendships.  I spent so much time doing things, that I guess I missed out on the fact that my high school chapter of life was actually ending.  I kept on telling myself as I went from class to class to cherish these moments while they last b/c oh, too, soon they will be gone, and well, now they are...GONE.  Now, dont get me wrong, I don't all mean to be pessimistic about this b/c in reality I'm really not.  I AM excited about college, but it's just that there are things I am going to miss about high school.  After all it was one of the best times of my life filled with tons of memories I knwo that I'll never forget...and these memories will always be with me.  And I am sure college will be just as fun and much more...  

Well I guess I really dont have anything else to say really. I may update again later.  Everyone take care.  Bye bye."

"event","Well night has been really good so far.  I'm getting more and more excited about college as it nears closer and closer each day.  I know that my roomate and I are going to get along great.  She really is a good person and I am glad that we are going to be roomates.  We are going to go shopping one of these days and get furniture for our room.... *I can't wait*... 

My parents and I went out to eat at AppleBee's tonight.  It was great, I absolultely love their steaks.  Although we got into a storm coming home, but all in all, it wasn't bad.  I think it will probabley storm here later.  Oh well, as long as I am home, I tend to like storms.  

I really have nothing to say tonight at the moment, but I just feel like writing.  Today was great.  Spent the whole day basically relaxing and on here playing around on LJ.  I may some of my own icons.  (I just learned how to do that today)  I like designing things on the computer, so you can imagine this was right up my alley.  I wish some more people were on here right now that could talk, I kind of feel like have an indepth conversation about well anything deep.  I feel like thinking tonight... maybe i'll read a book.  I need to read more of this one book for college.  It's called the tipping point.  It's alright, but there are other books i'd rather read at the moment.  But I feel I need to finish that one first i may not ever finish before college, which I have to finish it.  Okay, different subject.... hmmm... what can I talk about.... Let's see... how about music..yes, music, that will do...

I really haven't been into one certain group lately, which is odd for me b/c I tend to go through this different phases.  I mean overall, I love the beatles, by my favorite group of all time.  But one week I could be into Pink Floyd and the next I will be hooked on Ben Folds or something.  But I'm really not into any one person or band at the moment.  Been having basically my shuffle button on my playlist that way I get a little bit of everything that I like.  

Okay, well I think this is all i have for the moment, I may update more later.  Everyone take care. Bye bye."

I spent the whole morning training for my new job, and I should be starting it the beginning of next week with any luck. Ever since I got home I have been basically relaxing and enjoying the moment, the free time I seem to have at the moment.  I know it won't last, and everything is just going to fly by once college starts. 

I've been thinking the past couple of day all the possiblities there are in life.  I mean I can choose to do or be anything.  Yeah, sure, not everything will work out, but I can dream and be who I want to be.  There are so many doors of opportunities open to us in life, and often times I think we miss them because we are too preoccupied with other issues that we may feel are bigger.  But who know, I don't really know if anyone out there really understands what I'm saying, i'm not even sure I understand what I'm saying.  Sorry, I just felt the need to rant about this.  It is a good way to get out of me what I'm feeling inside, so to whoever actually reads all this, bless you, and thank you.  Well i'm out for now, talk to you all later.  Bye bye."

"event","Hello everyone.  It's going on 11 at the moment.  Been a pretty dull night.  Basically had supper, watched some tv and just spent the night with the family.  I actually have to get up early tomorrow...:(.  Getting up early definitely is not my strong suit...  I'm actually kind of tired at the moment, I should go to bed since I have to get up around 7, but knowing me, i'll probabley stay up till at least 12 or 1.  I am still in a bit of fraustrated mood about how fast time goes, and basically how line is going entirely too fast.  I've been listening to a variety of music this evening...but the one song that seems to stand out among them all shouting, listen to the words I have to convey is Jack Johnson's ""Breakdown.""  If you haven't heard it, it's basically about how people need to stop and really smell the roses of live sometimes.  Life does go to fast sometimes, but it is at these times that we need to ""breakdown"" and really see what there is in life, and what has been offered to us.  After all, an opportunity only knocks on your door once in some cases, so take advantage of the moment.  Work, school, etc... aren't always the most important things in life.  It is more important to be happy with yourself and your life.  Sometimes it takes an experience like graduation for a person to really ""breakdown"" and see what there is to see in the world.  Sometimes we are so closed minded and only do what is needed that we miss out on some of the best things in life, best friendships in life, etc..  Once in the world on your own, if you live in a big city, you meet some many people on the street but you never really get the chance to know anyone, and that is sad.  People need to learn to imbrace life for what it is.  Be happy and seize the day above all...Carpe Diem...  OKay, well i'm going to stop here... I've been what is sometimes referred to as a chatter box tonight, but it's been fun.  I'm really glad I got the chance to be involved in lj.  Thank you to a good friend who got me into all this, I love it.  It gives me to the chance to freely write whatever may be on my mine.  Brings back my journal writting day that weren't so long ago...haha.  Well i'll talk to you all later, take care.  Bye Bye."

"event","Wow, it is already the end of June.  That's crazy.  These days time goes by entirely too fast.  I can't keep up sometimes.  I mean the past four years of high school have been great.  Freshman years seemed a little long at the time, but looking back it went fast, along with sophomroe year.  However, it was my junior year that things began to pick up.  Trying to balance, homework with family, friends, and sports was definitely not an easy task.  The pace picked up and never slowed down, all it did was get faster as my senior year came.  It's amazing how fast this past year went.  I know that one I go to college I am going to miss some many of my good friends.  I mean, sure I will see them here and there....but it will never be like it is now... it is already starting to slow down a bit.  With everyone working and doign there own thing, there is just not enough time anymore to take the moments of each day and really live them.  Carpe Diem repeats in my mind each day, but all I can do is hope that I really am living.  This has truly been a great time in my life, and a part of me doesn't want it to end.  A part of me is afraid of what college will bring.  But then, there also is a part of me that is excited and is ready to go to college.  I know it's going to be a great experience...but I just don't want to forget those friends I have now, and I honestly don't think I will.  It's the song ""A Long December"" by the counting crows goes, ""I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself to hang on to these moments as they pass.""  Wow what a great line.  I just hope that this next chapter in my life will be just as good and even better than the past four years have been for me.  High school has been a time for me to start to find out who I am.  I've learned it doesn't matter what other people think of you, what is most important is that you have happy with you.  I've learned the only person I need to make happy is me, because if I can't make myself happy then I will never be happy. 

Now, onto a slightly different but still related subject.  As some of you already know, I went to orientation a couple of weeks ago for college.  It was a VERY long two days I must say.  It could have easily been done in one day, but that's not the point of this conversation.  The point is that I made new friends in just the two days we were there.  So, I know  that I will be okay, I'm a pretty friendly person and am easy to get along with most of the time so I should be fine and meet people very easily this fall.  Not to mention that I will have a few people from my hometown going to the same college, so also is a big plus for me.  The person I am rooming with is a good friend, so yet another plus for me...:)  But yet, I don't want to leave all that is here behind.  I know that i'll be home every now and then and I will get to see the people that I miss...but still, it's never going to be the same, it's just something that I need to learn to face, and I know that it will be fine.  I was scared leaving the Jr. High and coming to High School was a dream come true, so I am to believe that college will be no less than just that!  

Well I really dont think I have anything else to say at the moment, looks like it may storm here shortly.  It's getting a little dark out.  Oh well, me like storms, lol... just as long as they aren't too severe.  So, I think i'm gonna go for now, but I'll talk to everyone later, take care.  Bye Bye.

oh, and on another note, I was just thinking about songs and was listening to some eagles here, and I thought of the song ""Wasted Time"" and the lyrics that ring so true with what's going through my mind at the moment.  ""Sometime to keep it together, we got to leave it alone. So you can get on with your search baby and I can get on with mine. And maybe someday we'll find, that it really wasn't wasted time."" Ah, suck a GREAT song!  Well, okay, i'm gonna go now. Bye Bye."

It was terribly hard to follow, but I have got to say, I would have been completely and totally lost had I not had 3 years of spanish in high school.  We got home about 4 i would say and then I went swimming for a while.  It was relaxing, just what I needed.  I hope this week goes good.  I'm kind of hungry, I think we are getting ready to eat here shortly, so I suppose I should get off of here.  I will talk to you all later.  Bye Bye"

"event","Well it is only 1o till 11 and I'm tired....yes, it is sad.  I went to watch a tribute to the Beatles tonight at this festival.  It was actually kind of fun, and pretty good.  Not sure what I am doing tomorrow, possibly shopping, or maybe swimming again.  Either is great in my opinion.  I should go to bed shortly...but I'll probabley be up for atleast another hour or two, just my nature.  I was in a Beatles music mood earlier, but now, I am just really enjoying Pink Floyd's The Wall.  What a great concept album.  Let's see, I'm not real sure I have anything else to say.  Well I think I'm gonna go, everyone take care.  Bye Bye."

"event","Well it's sat. afternoon at 2:15, and i'm bored.  I went swimming for a little bit today.  It was fun.  Went to the fair too for a bit, wasn't much going on and dont care to do back.  It's just not like it use to be.  I think i'm going to some Beatles tribute tonight.... I hope it's good. I dont have much to do today, just kind of being lazy.  I think i'm going to be starting a job next week, so I suppose I better enjoy the time that I have now.  Oh, well, I need the money.  It'll be nice once I get to college.  Well I think thats about all I have to say at the moment.  I need to go take another shower I guess.  I always feel that I need another one after swimming.  So, I am gonna go, talk to you all later.  Enjoy the weekend."

"event","Wow is all I have to say about Jack Johnson's recent CD.  Yes, I must say that I am ashamed to say that tonight was the first time I actually bought the CD and listened to it all the way through.  It is amazing though.  I love ""Breakdown"".... what an excellent song.  For those of you out there that have never heard it, listen to it... well for that matter, listen to the whole CD.  It is well worth your time.  ""Better Together"" is good too.  It's really nice to write about music, this journal is great for it.  That is one thing i'm going to miss about high school.  I loved writing those music articles.  

Also on the lines of music.  Jack Johnson is coming to concert on Aug. 22..... I want to go so bad, but I start college that day, it's a monday.... what a major dissappointment.  First I couldn't go to the Ben Folds concert and now I can't go to Jack Johnson.  Oh well, I'll make it to one sometime..but I'd really like to make this one.  But there isn't much I can do about when college starts....:(....  Well I guess i'm gonna end it here for the night, I got alot of people talking to me and I can't seem to concentrate on this much anymore.  Bye Bye."

"event","Well, to say the least, it has been quite a day.  To start with, I went to get mom and I some lunch at McDonalds.  Well that went real well let me tell ya.  First of all, I sat in the drive-up line for what seemed like 2 hrs. but really was only 30 minutes, yeah, only 30 minutes.  So, my food seems to be pretty cold by the time I got to eat it...but that's not even half of it.  After I FINALLY got my food, I went to pull out onto main street and my car died, yes, it actually died!  So, here I am basically causing a traffic jam.  Thankfully this nice lady helped me push my car back out of the way of everyone.  Then my mom and dad came and got me.  I was not a happy camper to say the least.  But the rest of the day after that though has went well. (but it is only 5:30) though, haha.  Well I think that's it for now, maybe a little more later or tomorrow.  Gotta go eat now.  Bye Bye."

"event","Wow, the first live journal entry I have ever written.  Not sure what to say.  I guess I'll just rattle whatever is on my mind.  Well first of all it is fair week.  For the first time in years I just am not excited for it.  I guess it's a sign of getting older... :(  Oh well, it is all part of growing up.  This whole week I have been working on college stuff.  I had orientation last week.  It was a day and half, sort of fun I guess.  Ellen and I got our first rooming experience.  It went well :)  Well I guess I'm going to end it there tonight, I want to see what else I can do with this sight."

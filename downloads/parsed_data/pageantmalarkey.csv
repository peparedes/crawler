"event","This weekend I decide to grow the fvck up and move back in with my parents.

One of the continuing themes of my adult life (which began on the very day I opened my student account) is being overdrawn and in debt. I don't think I've been in the black financially at any time since 2004- even if you ignore student loans. It's an impressive series of balance transfers, debt shuffling, flexible loans and hefty overdrafts I've been cycling through since my late teens. Actually going back through accounts its clear that had I applied myself more vigorously I could have been an effective con woman/financial trader/contender. 

...

I wrote this all on Monday. Then I sat the fvck down and did a proper budget based on my earnings and outgoings, rather than a weird amount it turned out I had plucked out of the air. And it turns out everything is basically fine, as one might expect, and as one of the kids in IT points out early on (though I now realise based on the full plot of the novel was probably King taking a stab at literary irony). So yes, I will have to live to a budget for a while, and yes my parents now know just how rubbish I have continued to be with dosh as does Boyface (who didn't look as surprised as I had imagined he would). But maybe THAT'S the lesson I should have learned about growing up: it's owning up to your terrible mistakes, not necessarily trying to correct them by going to hide and cry in your teenage bedroom. I say SHOULD have learnt because I'm not actually 30 yet (12 glorious days to go), so I can chalk it up to my irresponsible 20s and forget by this time next year."

"event","It's been such a very long time since I done blogged, but here's a quaint thing, I've been finding myself more and more drawn to long form text lately. I quite like the implication that my universe has started dying and this is the result of everything expanding outwards from the big bang moment. 

Not going to bother to update this entry with everything that's happened in between since the last one. A series of victories and failures too numerous and largely dumb to mention, same as between any two blog posts. However, the next paragraph does give away some spoilers, so if you're trying to read my life story in order, you may want to skip back a few pages, or wait for the inevitable ghost written autobiography, ""How I Defeated Those Space Aliens That Time"".

So in the next 7 days, I intend to go on a Peter Ackroyd pub crawl with @strictlytrue, enter the Crossrail tunnels for My Job At the BBC, attend a night time exhibition about light with Stupid American Boy's wife, and tidy my room. Tidying my room is the most eternal of to-do list items. I'm never not technically about to tidy my room. Well maybe for about 30 minutes after I've been tidying my room when I'm having my post tidying my room snooze. In that static moment I'm literally not tidying my room or needing to tidy my room, but once I leave that room, or touch any item in the room other than my bed, then I am once again tidying my room. Or rather, not tidying my room.

Oh ok, so one update since my last blog you DO need to know: I now own a robot vacuum cleaner. Because future now."

"event","I've lost a lot of friends this year. 

Some I jettisoned knowingly, realising there was no room for compromise and less for feeling undermined at every juncture, others I've let drift, realising we've grown apart, and some, well, some I just can't tie down.

The old adage (or possibly song lyric or truism or fridge magnet, they all amount to the same thing, surely: words that through repetition undo every chance of original thought you've got), if you love them, let them go, is supposed to be a one time thing. You're not supposed to have to do that twice. You're not supposed to even have the chance.

So I'm sat here. Feeling guilty. Knowing that all the growing I spent five years doing: all the grief and petulance (God knows you've all been exposed to that) and the fvcking (metaphysical included [and I don't mean cybersex]) and the anger and the Goddamn relationships were a waste of time: I'm still as juvenile as ever. What was it someone called me on The Forum once? Puerile? (That phrasing was a bit Romanesque, apologies: Semper Bufo).

So I'm a child. And the worst of crimes in my head (let's take the legal ones out of the equation) is to declare your faults aloud and then say, ""But that's just me."" But. But what if this is just me? What if I'm a fool for life? And not one of those witty, erudite fools with their own sketch show and a gym membership they don't use, but one of those actual fools who shouldn't have survived this long and it's only the modern fad for extensive carpeting which has saved her.

The only thing that makes me think I have at least some OK brain smarts is I have such lovely friends (they were worth whittling down after all I guess) who in their presence in my life reassure me I'm not getting it entirely wrong. This blog is all about my selfish head and my selfish life, but it's dedicated to all those who have told me when my skirt is tucked into my pants, the people who fetch paper towels from the bar when I spill my pint, the people who laugh at my stupid jokes (as well as my clever, well-thought out ones) and the people who even when I've neglected their company for months greet me in the pub with a warm smile and an ancedote they've saved up for me about zombies.

And those people should be the ones I write about. Not the ones who abandon me at my darkest hour. Not the ones who somehow lead me into that darkest hour. Not the ones who make my life like some gut-wrenching, missed chance in some mawkish Ian McEwan novel (they ARE mawkish: they just have covers that make men feel it's alright to be seen reading them on the bus).

So here I am, feeling like I'm on a bike going downhill with the chain just come off, wondering which poor friend is going to pick up the pieces when I hit the curb at the bottom, while distraught that once again, no one saw which friend gave* me the bike in the first place.

*Simile-cum-metaphor falls apart at this precise point. Which is bizarrely at exactly the same point as I do."

"event","How do you know you're not insane? There are the obvious ways to check: have you been sectioned, do you know what year it is, is your desire for Cthulhu to turn out to be real still just an amusing affectation you've adopted to impress geek boys? But sometimes it's harder to know. Think of all the feelings you experience on a weekly basis that if you didn't have an immediate explanation for you'd be considering yourself properly Jack Torrance at the end of The Shining (or at the start, or in the middle. I'm just saying Nicholson never played sane well, if at all, ever).

I'm talking about the intense rage you feel when someone steals a seat on the tube you've been eyeing up and hovering over for a full 3 stops; the soul-burning desire for pizza/sex/instantaneous death that takes you over in the first hour of a hangover; the terrifying desire to fall into a coma and never wake that you feel in the first few bleary seconds of Monday morning. These are extreme emotions that you feel on a regular basis, and they are thankfully fleeting. If they sustained themselves and didn't have clear and traceable causes you'd be worried: believe me.

The way this has been effecting me is jet lag. At least I'm hoping it's jet lag. I feel so out of sync with the world that everything feels like reverse deja vu. I feel like, as events are happening around me, I'm watching them back from a few moments forward in the future. My responses to simple questions, (What's your name?, Who do you think you are?, Are you seriously wearing that outfit to the pub?), make no sense and are simply falling out of my mouth like teeth in an anxiety dream. Having said that, my dreams have become more lucid also due to the jet lag, so much so that I had the famous teeth-falling-out-anxiety dream in all its raw, goopy, chunky goodness only to awake to find I am indeed incredibly anxious about losing my teeth, and all my other anxieties seem very small in comparison to this horrific possibility.

At any rate, I feel entirely out of sync with not only time and space, but with people. It's making me wonder if I've gone slightly insane. All my emotions are amplified: I feel rage on the tube pre-emptively, and for hours after a transport-based slight. I've not had a hangover because I can't sleep long enough to wake up to one, though this has helpfully reinforced my internalised secret theory that hangover's aren't alcohol-induced, it's just that alcohol allows you to enter a deep enough state that you allow your body to manifest the exact emotion of feeling sorry for oneself as a series of physical symptoms. These may or may not be termed Wallow's Syndrome.

However, while jet lag has it's downsides, (lack of sleep, energy, happiness, and a deepening, creeping concern over possible insanity), it also has it's plus points too. For a start, I was worried these problems were indicative of the onset of depression, but jet lag has at least DELAYED my need to examine these overwhelming moments of sadness as anything other than a bit tired. It has given me a reason to fall even deeper into the aching crevasse that is my caffeine addiction. There's no need to justify my 5th cup of tea of the day, not even in the context of it following my 4th can of coke. Jet lag also allows for me to become glassy eyed in the most boring conversations: it's not you, it's the jet lag. I'm almost disappointed I'm not in a bad relationship so I could break it off with that line.

That bastion of accurate and never corruptible knowledge, Wikipedia, defines insanity as ""...a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns."" This is unhelpfully vague and doesn't allow me to make a solid and tidy comparison between the experiences I have posited here as being similar or the same as insanity. This leads me to believe my attempt to draw any correlation between madness and jet lag has been fallacious, or perhaps deluded, and, in itself, indicative of an abnormal mental state. 

The year, at present, is 2010.

"event","I have a new coat. It is massively lovely. I hope to emulate it in every way. There is however, a small problem with the Massively Lovely Coat. It has no real pockets.

It has fake ones, don't worry. No coat would be replete these days without extraneous buttons and elaborately stitched but ultimately futile pocket flaps. However, it has no real pockets within or without. This provides both positive bonuses and negative flaws.

On the plus side: I no longer ever have to worry about picking up my coat, usually from the pub floor where I have been carefully storing it in a puddle of Staropramen, and flinging vast quantities of coins, shrapnel, food stuffs and things I have purloined, every which way. This is a great pleasure for me, as this was my usual experience with every other coat I have owned.

On the down side: I no longer have a coat with pockets. All my important belongings (see above) now have to be contained within a bag. No problem, I hear you cry, buy a bag. Thanks; like I would have never figured that out on my own; you're invaluable. And patronising. 

The big question comes with where to store my phone. My bag is not secure enough, not even with all my important belongings to weigh down the more useful items that might lurk within it. Also, my phone plays music (this IS what the future is for) so I need it to be readily accessible should it play music I don't like (this is the future, but there's no technology yet that will stop me flooding my devices with mp3s of songs I don't like). The obvious solution is to keep my phone in my bra.

I have a long history of storing stuff in my bra: money, mp3 players, lipbalms, memos to remind me to wash once in a while, my breasts. But storing a phone this cumbersome in there has become tiresome. Especially having to rummage around in my brassiere while on public transport. Some people look overly offended, while others, overly interested. What's a modern girl to do?

It's tempting to throw the towel in to that new puddle of Staropramen and admit fate: the Massively Lovely Coat doesn't perform adequately. It should be got rid of. But that just causes more problems. If I don't have a coat, my phone-bra interactions will be all the more obvious to the public. So, you see, I'm rather much caught between a rock and a hard place here. 

NONE of this would be a problem if society were just a bit more tolerant."

"event","I spent today at my parents' house, alternating between sofas, researching, and trying to be creative. Edinburgh Fringe Festival has drained me dry of any desire to be human. It has also partially sapped my energy for TV and comedy and any combination thereof. I will get my mojo back I'm sure, but I just feel if Edinburgh represents even 10% of the people involved then perhaps I am not one of them and I should turn to a more suitable career: Librarian or key stage 2 science teacher?

This misanthropy and self hate may of course be derived simply from staying up until 5am every night for 2 weeks.

Tonight's Eastenders was an incredibly accurate depiction of a typical British Bank Holiday. Dull, dull and sex in a caravan.

Today's fail: staying up very late last night because I kept thinking the hatstand in the guest room was an intruder. Sorted this around 4am by removing the hat from the the uppermost branches and poking the coats with a convenient umbrella. Slept peacefully, dreaming of cults."

She phoned back and left an angry message saying ""HOW THE HELL DO I KNOW WHEN YOUR PERFORMANCES START?""

While she had a point there was no need to leave angry voicemail.

This morning she was railing at me for snapping at my scroungey uncle (eg. he asked to borrow my sax from my parents while I was at uni and sold it) when I haven't even spoken to him directly and the phone went.

""Hello... Oh... yes... last night...sorry""

"event","For my delictation, rather than probably yours, here is a complete list of everything I saw at Edinburgh this year:

Art:
Eva Hesse (never before displayed studio works [you could still see her thumb prints 30 years on])
The Enlightenments (new art based on Enlightenment themes: ukelele news performance was the best)
Arists Rooms (including Damien Hirst's classics, Celmins, Gallagher, Katz, Martin, Warhol, and Woodman)
Jane and Louise Wilson (film/photos based on Kubrick's unmade film The Aryan Papers)


Comedy:
Superclump (9 stand ups do sketches, then get swine flu)
Trevor Lock (Harry Hill meets Russell Brand with a 15 minute pause in the middle)
Twinge Party (Frisky and Mannish blow my pop mind; Princess Cabaret do the same song a lot; live comedy tweeting from Late Night Gimp Fight, Tony Cowards, Joey Lycett, Ewan Spence [I organised this bit])
Andrew O'Neill (exquisitely good stand up with enough puns to kill a horse)
Silent Disco (MEH)
Chris Cox (I've worked out how it was all done except one trick: how does he force Peter [not as rude as it sounds, but I do <3 Cox])
Pink Bus (lots of hot young comedians on a hot pink bus filled with charity shop detritus [Max and Ivan shone out])
Rich Hall (slick comedy while being dive-bombed by two moths)
Late Night Gimp Fight (perfectly pitched late night sketches... and gimps)
Tommy and the Weeks (one of my absolutely favourite shows- I <3 the ghost in Tom Bell's hair)
Fucking Funny for a Fiver (I can't remember any of this)
The Fix Presents (the editor of The Fix drains any good will from the room then forces Tim Key to perform to our soulless corpses)
For One Night Only (comedy from acts called Tom [Basden did his rude set because his girlfriend was there])
Idiots of Ants (Brilliant, slick, effortless: might as well have been on TV)
Twitter Comedy (Tiernan Douieb showcases basically everybody on the fringe in an epic 2 hour gig of technical difficulties and Michael Legge wanking)
Stand Up Poetry (Laura Dockerill takes my heart in a stunning performance, Luke Wright, Phill Jupitus and Andre from Early Edition do some poems)
Robin Ince's free show (Absolute genius: a perfect show)
Random night of Cabaret in Assembly Rooms (I didn't see a man drag a string of uninflated balloons through his nostrils, I did see wonderful cabaret songs about death and fell in love with Frisky)
Guilty Pleasure (Jen and I danced like fools and an actor bought us a drink)
Alex Maple (there was free chocolate and Alex spent most of the show trying to get himself arrested by the policeman in the front row)
David O'Doherty (a lovely, friendly hour: not enough songs)
Marcus Brigstocke (Pitch perfect, anti-religion argument that then cops out)
Karaoke Circus (best show at the fringe: Ince singing Cococabana indelibly etched in my ear drums, Herring's Sparks cover best left alone)
Tom Bell (you're in safe and loving comedic hands, but the mic cable is in a puddle, Tom)
Mike Wozniak (didn't laugh much at the time but giggling like a fool about it for 3 days afterwards: slow burner)
Jon Richardson's Radio 6 show (Micky Flanagan, Jack Whitehall [fit but standard comedy], Dead Cat Bounce [Irish comedy rock], and for no reason Malcolm Middleton)
Comedy Countdown (second best show of the fringe: Wozniak's chemical symbol won my heart, Ed Aczel's world weary winning was lovable, Dan Atkinson's drunk presenter was drunk, and Sinha as Carol inspired)
Matt Kirshen (wonderful storytelling, but I'm still shorter than Napoleon)
King of Everything (indulgent but very funny)
Fergus Craig (lovely show- not enough Neighbours clips!)
Bourgeois and Maurice (stunning cabaret, excellent video: let Maurice sing!)
Bridget Christie (the touch of lee makes this AMAZING: Christie deserves more attention)
A Slight Dangerous Comedy Occasion (I watched Ivo Graeme shave all of Ben Target's beautiful hair off and I almost cried)
Pappy's Fun Club (the best show on and off the fringe but with Advocaat. I can still taste the rotten stuff).
The Hotel (last ever show, completely chaotic, brilliant [the interview was especially funny])

I've worked out I saw over 100 comedians do at least 5 mins of material each, and I saw still more drunkenly babbling in Brookes.

I performed in over 20 Hotel shows and my throat is still sore from shouting ""THIS ADMIN CENTRE HAS BEEN APPROVED OF BY INTERNATIONAL POP SENSATION CHER"".

I have come back inspired, hopeful, dedicated and in love with the city of Edinburgh. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the best month of my life to date."

Highlight

Thursday 21 May
8:00pm - 9:00pm
Channel 4
1/8

One of television's more useful and informative property shows returns as cheery, sensible architect George Clarke gets to grips with a ramshackle house. Antony and Alicia have lived in their terraced home since they were both students, and in 13 years have done nothing to stop it from sliding into crumbling disrepair. The place is a mess - the roof's in a terrible state, the chimney is unsafe, huge wall cracks let in chilly winds, the decor is dreadful and there's clutter everywhere. So George moves in, gets to know the problems and prepares to put things right. Which is where we come to The Home Show's central gimmick - Antony and Alicia have to move out, having handed George a huge cheque to spend as he pleases. And they won't be back for ten weeks, until the project is complete. Talk about trusting... But George is a good egg and sets to work immediately. First, clear every last nook and cranny of every last stick of furniture and spray-paint the whole place white, to give an idea of the house's space. (And it's a remarkably effective device, which always galvanises the house-owners.) Then the real work begins, which is where the problems start. It seems that huge cheque might not be big enough after all.

"event","On Saturday morning I had my first ever house viewing and I took my dad with me since the place reportedly needed a lot of work (it does indeed- new carpets, new kitchen and a new bathroom and that's just for starters).

Afterwards we did some packing and took my drums, exercise bike and all my boxes full of wool, photos and My Little Ponies to Tooting to Louise's house. I now feel much more at home surrounded by bits of wool and crayons and plastic horses even if I still am sleeping on the couch for another 2 weeks.

My dad then took me for lunch at the Windmill in Clapham where he proceeded to tell me for no apparent reason the story of Suzy Lamplugh. What happened next was an act of untimely transference and left me feeling like I was having a breakdown.

I cannot explain in full why things, such random things, have such a great effect on me sometimes. The story of Suzy continued to haunt me all day, even after my dad had gone home. I tried to take my mind off it. I dyed my hair purple. I worked AQA. I went and got mullered in Soho. I sobered up and went to Ballans for an alcoholic breakfast with friends. And still at 5am I couldn't get Suzy's story out of my head.

I went back to Camberwell on a night bus and as I got closer and closer to my front door I realised there was absolutely no way I could go into an empty flat. So I turned round and headed for Louise's. It took me a whole extra hour to get to Tooting.

Then for the whole of today I have largely just sat in doors thinking about it. And researching it on the internet. Then I got into a really bad place and started reading pages like this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_mysteriously_disappeared

Or rather, reading every entry listed on a page like that.

And I really shouldn't keep obsessing over the Beaumont children but there's something so... unfinished about the whole business.

When Louise got in this evening I tried to explain about Suzy but I just got all shakey and started crying.

The only way I can explain any of this is that I'm transferring the pain and confusion caused by moving house and being on my own on to a woman who (probably) died over 20 years ago. But even now I'm still sitting here feeling like I'm stuck in an M R James story and that the doorbell will ring and Mr Kipper will be waiting for me outside.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/mar/06/watchmen-women

Many reviews including this one have led to me decide to eschew THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY FVCKING YEAR in favour of <b>The Patented Elise X Men Method</b>. That method being waiting 8 years for the hype to die down before being able to watch it as a camp piece of fluffy fun, rather than spending years fuming that something I owned a part of (or rather something that owned a part of me) has been destroyed by crass marketing, and the inability of directors to not interpret ""sexing something up"" as removing women's clothing.

While there are certainly still elements of the book I am crying out to see translated well on screen that clearly have been executed with a modicom of charm and beauty (the stuff on Mars is reputedly ""good""), I imagine within a few days I should be able to see them individually on YouTube or other copyright infringing internet sites.

Instead I am going to heavily emotionally invest in my own adaptation of <b>The Chrysalids</b> (due out in 2025 [funding/talent/career pending]) which even if it is a disappointment to myself and the larger world will at least be heartfelt."

I'm trying to find out how many extensions were built on houses in the 1980s.

Obviously this is pie in the sky, but having read up on Nigel Lawson's contribution to the crash I think there might well be a stat out there. 

My superiors inform me there was regulation or possibly grants allowed for extending your house in the 1980s because no one could afford to buy.

This sounds like a misremembered understanding of deregulation of lending in 1988.

Any help/misremember ramblings/hardcore factage appreciated. 

Clearly I was ""born too late, into a world that didn't care about the UK housing market enough to teach me about in my standardised public schooling""."

"event","<b>Robocop</b>
We spent the duration of this <b>Wikipedia-ing</b> every single person in this in order to stop ourselves going, ""Oh! What's he <b>from</b>?"" My favourite example of this was the villain I was convinced I knew, who turned out to be Leonard Betts from <b>X-Files</b>. What a great episode. And what a great death in the film! I remember when we all thought toxic waste would instantly transform you into a mutant. 

The only bad point about <b>Robocop</b> was the way whenever there was a scene without robots, explosions or guns in it, I completely tuned out. Men with ties, blah blah, corruption, blah. People only want to see <b>robots and guns.</b> Don't forget that.

<b>Shrek</b>
I've never actually seen <b>Shrek</b>, so this was a bit weird as I felt masses of deja vu from having people quote the darn thing at me for years, only to be rewarded by some <b>blank faced blinking</b>. It was pretty interesting, and there were some good gags, but for the most part I was distracted by the fact the animation differs so wildly between characters. I don't like people's faces to be so disproportionate to one another. It enraged me at times. And made me want to play WoW and <b>go kill some fauns</b>.

<b>Alien: Resurrection</b>
Doesn't this look EXACTLY the same as <b>Delicatessen?</b> We missed the first 10 minutes and spent the remaining duration of the film going, ""Oh! What's he <b>from</b>?"", that and the similar storyline to some other films I've seen called <b>Alien, Aliens, Alien 3,</b> etc. meant that this was even more deja vu-ey than the other two films we'd watched. I think it's bloody good though. I can't believe Weaver actually got that basket on the 6th take. Also I still kind of like Ron Perlman even without his <b>Hellboy</b> prosthetics. Not as much though.

<b>Slumdog Millionaire</b>
This was quite good. Although I have to admit to being bored for most of it. As soon as we worked out the pattern of boy feeling happy, then <b>someone making him miserable so he'd remember an important fact,</b> it seemed a bit futile and inevitable. I do not enjoy feeling futile ALL THE WAY THROUGH A FILM. I only enjoy it <b>at the end</b> (<b>The Orphanage, The Prestige</b>). The dance at the end (this is not a spoiler) was the best bit. And it's not a feel-good movie: it's a movie written around having a good montage at the end. Excellent kid-acting though. You don't see that so often."

"event","Working from home is lame. There's no fruit bowl; no toast and jam; no endless cups of tea; no sending work experiences for lattes; no seeing how often I can circumnavigate the whole building on the pretense of looking for pink Post-It notes; no long conversations with pretty girls whose names I've forgotten in the kitchen; no mucking around with cables and cameras; no pool table; no Coca Cola on tap; no mates to have stupid conversations with at 4pm; no fishes to stare at.

Still, I have actually got an unfeasible amount of work done today, so perhaps there's something to be said from it."

"event","I'm ill again! Stupid, weak human flesh. When will I evolve out of this pointless experience of just feeling a bit meh and overproducing mucus.

I've got penicillin, which the doctor told me I could combine with paracetemol and with ibuprofen, so now I'm full of Night Nurse and prescription drugs waiting to feel better already.

The instructions say I should take the pills on an empty stomach or 1 hour before eating.

This doesn't make any sense. If I have an empty stomach I will want to eat in less than 1 hour's time. So I can never know when to take the damn things.

Plus I need to ring the Inland Revenue and my estate agents today but I just sound like a dirty phone call with my wretched voice and gasping breaths.

The inside of my ears are swelling up. Woe is me."

"event","Beautiful comedy with Terry Saunders tonight. It brings a tear to my eye to hear stories that end well, and told with such charm. I think Terry rejects the idea that he is charming as anti-everything he stands for, but he is charming and one of the few people that would clearly be able to talk to animals, if the animals themselves were bothered.

He's doing 2 more of his shows at The White Bear on Kennington Park Road tomorrow night and I heartily recommend people attend.

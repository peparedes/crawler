""You should think things through a little bit more.  Sometimes what's trivial to you can really hurt the person you love...""  -so true so true


here's a long one:

""What? What are you so happy about?  The girl you love considers you just a 'friend'!  Doesn't that make you hopeless...?  Even so, you still love her?  You'll be satisfied with just being her friend?  What's so great about her?!  Her face, her figure?  I'm sorry, but I exceed her in both aspects!""
""Now that you mention it, you are pretty and do have a nice figure...""
""Wh...what?!  'Now that you mention it'...?!  Don't you even look at me?!""
""Actually I do, but...""
""Well if you find me attractive, then why don't you love me?""
""Matsumoto...you have a strange notion of love...""
""Uh...?""
""Of course, your appearance can be a factor to make someone love you...but, looks don't represent a person's whole being, you know?  An ""Attraction"" doesn't equate to ""love"" after all.  If you want someone who loves you only for your looks, then...I'm sorry, you should look elsewhere.""

"event","This is a mini essay on Rwanda so if you don't want to listen....don't.  But I can't use my voice to spread the word so I'll use a keyboard and a comp.
     
     In 1994 during a three month span over 800,000 people were massacred, beaten, slain, slaughtered, shot, and raped by their own countrymen.  Radical Hutu murdered tutsi and moderate hutu.  During this three month time slot the United Nations failed to act and stop this genocide in Rwanda.  There reasoning was that the genocide was in fact a civil war.  For those who are unaware, the moment the United Nations uses the word genocide they are compelled to act, hence their hesitation.  The question then arises,  "" How long must a group plan?  How organized do they need to be?  How long must the killing go on and how many must die before we act?""  There were warning signs almost 10 monthes before the genocide occurred.  Even one incident where Genereal Dellaire, a Belgium peacekeeper, found a stockpile of weapons that were going to be used for the genocide but was denied the right to confiscate them.  The radical Hutu planned this operation for monthes and the killing was to be extremely systimatic, everyone knew which village they were supposed to assault.  From start to finish, the genocide lasted 100 days, 24,000 hours and almost a million people were killed in that timeframe.  The genocide did not start as a civil war but it ended in one when the RPF, Rwandan Patriotic Front, finally managed to push the Radical Hutu back.
   The United Nations was given over a hundred warning signs before the genocide occurred, many were quite blunt saying that it would be better if all the Tutsi were dead.  During the entire duration of the genocide, General Dallaire gave daily reports on the genocide as he remained in the center of it.  He told the United Nations of the horrible attrocities that were going on in Rwanda and the United Nations still refused to act.  Two monthes after the genocide had started the United Nations finally issued a report stating that genocide might have occurred.  Later they finally decided to send aid but were held up because the United States could not agree to a price on the vehicles.  When 5,500 troops did finally land in Rwanda they were always behind the actual killing and were of no assistance to those in need of aid.  One way to look at this is to view it in this analogy:  Imagine you're the police officer at the school and a month before the event is going to happen you hear that some kid is planning to kill some asian classmates.  You shrug it off and ignore the other warnings that come your way.  Two weeks before the killing though, one of your subordinates says he saw the kid buying a gun and asks if he should confiscate it; you tell him 'no' and you yourself do nothing.  Then the killing begins.  It happens not for one day, not for two, but for two weeks.  Every day for two weeks this kid walks in and kills some of your asian classmates.  And you do nothing but stand there and watch.  When you finally start to react, you do it half-assed and nothing is accomplished.  It isn't until the asians finally manage to strike back that the killing stops.
  It's quite a low-point in our history and we need to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Sadly it is happening again in Darfur, and at some point we have to say enough is enough and act.  If nothing else, walk away with this knowledge and promise yourself that such an atrocity won't ever float past our eyes again.

"event","Okay so I felt like posting something really quick before I head out to lunch with Katherine and her mom.  I just finished watching ""My Girl and I"" and it's a truly beautiful movie.  It far surpasses ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Pride and Prejudice"", and I'd even say ""The Titanic"".  I'm usually able to at least attempt to describe things, but here there's no point in trying, words fall short of its brilliance; there is no description I could give that would do the movie justice.  Oh and fyi, it's a korean movie that I own so if you want to watch it, all you guys have to do is ask; though you'll have to watch it in subtitles, unless you're Min but she's on Xanga so the point's mute.

To give some perspective on how outstanding and moving the movie was: The only time I've cried while watching a movie was during Hotel Rwanda and it happened three times.  Towards the middle and end of ""My Girl and I"" I cried almost continuously.  It really is a remarkable movie that I hope you guys get the chance to watch.

okay, here's the odd request.  My mom was wondering if you/somebody else if you prefer, could go to the their bathroom, i.e. the one that isn't mine with the bathtub in it and the door that actually locks, and water the plant there.  It only needs to be watered one time b/c we get back Saturday.  But if you could do that we would be forever in your debt....or at least until I gave you the stuff I got ^^.

We'll check periodically but if you can think of a more effective method relay that through lj for now as I don't have aim and calling long distance would be crazy.

Simple stones become pawns in a conquest that involves logic, strategy, wit, quick-thinking, creativity, originality, and intuition.

Yes, me the not exactly anti-spongebob, but not a fanatic either kind of person.  But hey, it was crazy cool, surprisingly.  Hope the sentence up above didn't confuse anyone too much, i just write wordy, which will be good for my Science Fair report! Oh, and I got to hold Kitsuneellie's hand...comforting but it was a little funny, since we were watching the SPONGEBOB MOVIE-(not a bad thing though)! Anyway, afterwards Stongyglenrider's parents kindly took us out for chinese.  Wherein after Stonyglenrider gleefully bought the Chronicles of Riddick at Coconuts.  LOL, there was a poster advertising for I believe a life size Gollum/Smeagol stand/poster/thingy that TALKED!!  That looked pretty cool.  So...after that we went back to Stonyglenrider's house and had these incredibly crazy awesome milkshakes(peppermint/chocolate ^_^).  I also met their cat, whom I shall be catsitting pretty soon, YAY, catsitting-fun stuff...though cat's aren't always as much fun as dogs.
    I feel like a gushy fangirl right now.  That's just the sort of mood I'm in.  All giddy and happy.  We started the chronicles of Riddick, and we watched that, Stonyglenrider, her dad, myself, and Kitsuneellie.  The movie was pretty good, but it was a tad bit hard to concentrate...  LOL  I got my first and best kiss from Kitsuneellie -^_^-.  Though I'm a horrible kisser-probably cuz I never used Su's kissing machine, and never practiced with a pillow -_-'.  But wow, never felt that close to anyone before.  What a feeling...  I just hope I didn't mess anything up.  Cuz at both movie's I felt I was missing some serious hints and I feel really bad about that-cuz I can be just that dense.  So that's my appology to Kitsuneellie if I made a fool of myself LOL, which I think I can live with.  I don't know if were officially a couple, but either way, if things stay the way they are, I more than content-*cough* note the mood *cough*.  I just gotta say that I hope I'm note TOO boring.  I'm usually more a listener than a talker at times-LOl and I hope that doesn't bother either of you girls too much (hope I'm using the right to-sorry, can't help it).
     Well, now I've got to go brush up on my geometry, finish readng Tokyo Mew Mew, finish up my english essay, complete my algebra hwk, play guitar, eat something some where in there, study a little for the history quiz, do spanish hwk, and draw-my skills need serious improvement-But I'll never give up! That's my ninja way!; right, so that's the stuff I get to do, before heading over to Kitsuneellie's house to tutor.  So, until then, I don't know exactly what stoneyglenrider's doing today, but I hope it's fun and delricious-don't ask why, just I hope it is.  And I hope Kitsuneellie's viola practice goes well, and is crazy awesome.

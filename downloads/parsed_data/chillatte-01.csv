I've managed to waste my summer in Fort Erie.
A town I'm sure none of you know of..
But anyways,
I don't have much time to chitchat, since I only have
31 minutes remaining on this computer.
And yes I'm sitting here in a library,
(which is actually cleaner and cozier than the ones in T.O)
my only source of a computer with internet.
Stupid parents..
And I've been forced to work at their store.
THEY DON'T EVEN PAY ME.
This is Child labour I tell you!!
I don't even know what it is about Toronto I miss.
I just want to go back,
although I know I'll probably rot at my aunts in Toronto anyway.
Bah, nothing is fun anywhere.
I miss you guys... Sniff.

Ps I was just reminded, I need a fukin haircut!!!
So please Becca, you're coming with me when I'm back in Toronto.
I trust your taste in hair... although that sounds quite wrong."

"event","I'm not sure what to be more surprised about.
How incredibly cheap and desperate Torontonians are, or..
What people are willing to do for free things.
Camping out from 4:30 p.m. the day before?? Not getting any sleep??
Are people in Toronto that poor?
Man.. I was so excited when I first saw the little line by the entrance.
And then BAM.
Anyways.. I still had a fun time with Becca and Juby,
especially testing out all those comfortable beds.
But I would've liked to be rewarded for waking up at 5 a.m. Pooh.
Oh well.. next year, we'll use that idea with the chair.
Hahahha. I'm sure it will work perfectly."

"event","Wow.. so summer is almost half gone
And once again I have done nothing to truly exhilirate my boring life
Oh well. The story of my life.
Anyways, it's been alright these past few days.
Surprising, since I'm stuck with my two cousins, who expect me to cook for them
Ahahaha.. as if they really want to eat what I cook.

I have a co-op interview tomorrow, and gosh I'm nervous.
I hate those interviews.. they ask you the most obvious questions.
""So why do you think you're suitable for our placement? blahblahblah
I'm just blabbing to look intelligent.""

Grade 12 is going to be <i>weird</i>
I have all english-related courses in one semester,
and all technical, headache-causing sciences in the other.
Oh gawd I'm going to die. :'(

That's it for now..
I had so much to write,, but I think I'm too exhausted.
Besides I have to go make some tea =D hehe.."

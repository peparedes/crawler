"event","This afternoon I tried to go to the bank to cash in my change jar, but they closed early... Then it started snowing lightly. There weren't nearly as many people out, and I was able to get into the Giant and get a few things. After dropping them off at home, I took my car to a local parking garage after checking with their security - they said it was ok but at my own risk, of course. But I think that's better than getting it buried under another blizzard, plus a lot of trees came down in the community, and others are just hanging there - more are sure to fall. There was no chance for maintenance to deal with it.

Here's how Spring Lake looks between blizzards:

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

A WINTER STORM WARNING MEANS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF SNOW ARE
EXPECTED OR OCCURRING. THE COMBINATION OF SNOW AND STRONG WINDS
WILL MAKE TRAVEL VERY HAZARDOUS.

----
Although the D.C. area has had major snowfall before, we just had the Super Blizzard 4 days ago with over 2' of snow. It also snowed a few inches last week, and there was a snow emergency from the Jan. 29-30th storm. If we get 10-20"" more now, this will be a major disaster. 

Some of the news coverage of Super Blizzard made it look like a big party, with everyone laughing and playing and helping each other. That's not what I've been seeing. In my condo parking lot, people weren't being very neighborly. We don't have assigned parking, so after you dig out you are on your own. But there are rules - don't dump your snow on someone else's car, or on the sidewalk. That means you have to carry each shovelful to the other side of the sidewalk, or the field across the street. The owner of the SUV parked to my right decided that it was easier to shovel his/her snow up against the side and front of my car. ALL of it. After chopping and pushing as much of it as I could back in their direction, I went on the other side, dug a tunnel to the door, and cleared the exhaust area. I dug for about 1 1/2 hrs and was half done on Sun. night. When I came back out on Monday, the remaining pile of snow against the front and right side of the car had frozen solid. So, I got an idea. I started the car again, and finished digging out the left side, top, back, and windshields. After about an hour, the heat of my car running had melted a thin margin of the snowpile that had me boxed in. Very carefully I backed out, leaving a perfect impression of the front and side of my car in the heap of ice! It is still there. Then I went to a clear area and cleaned off the front and the tires.

Next I did a quick tour of the local area. The side roads are barely passable as people left their cars on the street. At the post office, cars blocked the only cleared passage to the front door. I drove to the Giant, but there was no chance in hell of getting through the parking lot, let alone to get into the store. So, I went to the Shell convenience store. I only needed a few things - but it seems like most of the population here hasn't planned ahead. After all, why should they expect 4 storms in 11 days? There's already no place to put the existing snow. It's going to have to be trucked out.

The thing that's bothering me the most is that I haven't heard anyone asking why this is happening. Where are these storms coming from? What is causing them? The forecasts have been strangely accurate for time, place, and amount of snow. It's just giving me the creeps."

"event","Given the weather conditions this evening, we've reluctantly decided to close Midnight. Although the snow will reportedly be ending in the next few hours, all media reports we're hearing--confirmed by many people who have actually been out--indicate that the road conditions are awful, particularly further south of the Beltway. At last check, Metro bus service has been reduced to emergency routes only. Icing is likely to be a particularly serious issue. And while there is currently no D.C. parking emergency in effect, it is possible that one may yet be imposed so that the city can clear the streets once the snow ends. Sixx is concerned that there may be some towing of people down in the L Street corridor in particular.

We realize that there was a considerable amount of enthusiasm about our promotion for ""The Wolfman"" (http://www.thewolfmanmovie.com) tonight, and we've rescheduled that for next Saturday, along with some of then other things we had planned.

Stay home, stay warm, and we hope you can join us next Saturday.

"".:-|What is your true element?|-:. -With Anime Pictures and detailed answers-"" - Results: 
 
Your element is earth: Wise, solitary, mysterious and loving. You are very wise. Your wise as in you know things others do not, you can see past stereotypes and see the real people behind their facades, and people will often come to you for help and advice. Quite solitary and somewhat shy around people because you prefer animals and plants, animals aren't afraid to show themselves or what they are feeling and plants are fun to nurture. You are very strong in your silence if you set your mind on something you will often times pursue it to the end. Sometimes you just want to get away, so you seek refuge in the forest where you can have time to think and try to sort out your emotions. The sound of the wind usually calms you, especially moving through the trees. Life to you is something precious and should not be taken for granted."

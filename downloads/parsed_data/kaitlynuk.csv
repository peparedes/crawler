"event","<p>these last 4 years of my life have changed me so entirely much. during this time I've become the worst person I could ever imagine and the best person I never thought I could be. I'm still working on the better part but it seems like I continually make choices I never should or never would have years ago. when I look back to me in 09, i don't know who that person is. 2010, different person, still no clue. 2011, ?  2012, I feel like I'm riding the line between the both of this. this Jekyll and Hyde thing I've got going on is working. and I'm not happy about it. I've gained so much strength but I've also lost so much of myself in the process. I'm not even sure if its possible, but I guess it is. it doesn't feel real. and sometimes I'm not even convinced all the things I've done are true. I'm in denial but also trying to accept it at the same time. I'm not sure where I stand right now, with anything at all. all I know is I'm alone. and that's how I want it. I'm trying so hard to figure this life out, and maybe it'll never happen. but all I know is ill never stop trying. or enjoying it good or bad. I just wish that even with all this strength and knowledge I've learned that I still didn't feel so much like an empty shell. I'm a jellyfish lost in the deep sea still trying to find my brain and backbone. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>I'm weening myself off of my medications. and I'm not sure how I feel about it right now. <br>I'm so emotional and easily upset. but this is the life I knew for 18+ years. it got to where I couldn't cope with it, so I started medications. and therapy. and more therapy. and more therapy. <br>and I'm aware that no one quite understands what I've been through. nor will they. but I'm not looking for understanding. <br>well, I am at the moment just because everyone has gotten so used to the new me and the finally-happy-for-once me so that now that I haven't been taking my medicines, I haven't been reacting the same. things are upsetting me easily and getting under my skin when just a month or so ago I would have easily overlooked them. <br>but all of this is not something that can easily be explained, and I definitely don't want to explain myself. <br>my therapist that ive had for the last 3 years is gone. and my work is done with him. I've ended on a good note. and even though my therapy isn't finished, I'm on my own now. <br>I have to learn how to cope with this without all of these crutches. all of the 15 different medications, therapy, psychiatrist, groups, classes, etc I've had I can't keep using forever. yes they have benefited my life to the full extent, but now I have to take<br>everything I've learned and been through over the past 3 years and do something with it. <br>I've finally reached the point where I analyze<br>my behavior and emotions and I understand them and I understand my thinking. I have a great amount of insight when it comes to those. but I still have several irrational thoughts that I'm unaware of as well as self esteem issues I'm slowly but surely working on. <br>this is the first time in since I was 12 pretty much that I haven't had someone to lean on or run to. yeah, I have friends, but they're not supportive and I don't discuss these things with them. in every situation in my life, I've placed it all on someone else's shoulders. tony, aaron, Kristin, dad. they've always been there. especially aaron. he's literally been there since I was 12. but I can't depend on him anymore. I need to be independent. I need to stand strong on my own. im totally alone in this, but I'm enjoying it. this is such a great accomplishment for me as well as opportunity. I'm growing so much and finally focusing on me for once. I've never done this before. and at first I was petrified, but now it's been a few months and I'm okay with it. it isn't easy, but it's not as bad as I expected it to be. I thought by this point I'd have a break down and have to start from scratch all over again. but I've only had some minor set backs, and i've gotten over them and learned from them. and continued on my way. this independent thing is amazing, but it leaves me alone with my thoughts which i still struggle with. I can't always control my anxious thoughts and lately I've been experiencing some paranoia and close<br>calls with some panic attacks. Nikki and palmer say I'm being dramatic, but they're just ignorant. but that's okay. I know they don't know everything. and they can be wrong all they want. <br>it's amazing to me how different I've become since I've started college. I honestly feel like an entirely different person. well, I am<br>an entirely different person.<br>I've had to completely wipe out everything ive ever known and I've had to search to hold onto the core things that make me<br>who I am. a lot of which I'm certain of, other I'm still trying to figure out, but I'll get there. <br>but I've had to relearn everything basically. how to think, how to react, how to talk, how to make friends, how to function in society, how to function alone, when something is okay and when something isn't, how to breathe, how to cry, etc. now I really have to pick my battles when it comes to my emotions and thinking. and it's definitely a struggle. I've always been so hardheaded, arrogant, rude, bitchy, inconsiderate, etc. but now it's like my mind has been opened. and even though it makes things more difficult, it also makes them easier. sometimes I feel like I'm at a disadvantage to society, other times I feel like I'm at such a great advantage I wish I could share it with others, but it's not that easy, unfortunately. this blessing is my burden, and this burden is my blessing. and even though it's difficult, I choose to see it as a gift. not everyone will have the chance/will take advantage of their chance to see what I've seen and learn what ive learned. and it saddens me. but I'm taking all I can out this wretched situation and I've made the most of it. I know I'm not there, but for my age, ive made enough progress I'm surpassing most middle aged adults.<br>technically the mindstate that I have now makes me 'the Buddha' which means ""the enlighten one of an age"" which I feel like I am. I have knowledge others dont, and I feel like there are only a few of us in the generation that are on the same level as me, therefore, making us few 'Buddha'. which is why I'm so obsessed with it I think. <br>this may not make sense to anyone else that may or may not read this, but i don't know how to explain it. <br>I was 18 years old when I started an intense outpatient therapy program. of a group of about 30 people, i was younger than everyone by at least 15 years. I couldn't imagine going through anything like this 15 years from now. thank god I reach my breaking point when I did. because at a time when most teenagers are just graduating and their only concern is who broke up with them last week, who there friend is this month, or what's going on Friday night, I was reconstructing my entire brain. do you understand how difficult that is? I don't think anyone does. or at least anyone I know. my<br>concerns were when is an earthquake gonna hit and sink half of america, when is my dad gonna die and leave me to fend for myself and make me experience the most painful thing that can ever occur in my life as well as fulfill my biggest fear, when am I gonna stop breathing, when will the sun not rise again, who is god and where is he, how many exact seconds are left on this earth, what percentage do I have of surviving the next year, 1/100000000000000000?, what's the chance of the sun exploding, what if the Mayan calendar is correct, is the illuminati real, am I really being brainwashed, does anyone know i exist, what number<br>is the microwave on, what number is the<br>volume on, how many ice cubes are in my drink, is it an odd number, even numbers are evil, even numbers mean you will die sooner, even numbers mean you are out of control, they are ugly, avoid even numbers as well as 5.0.9 or an double number like 22, avoid any seat with an even number or you will surely die a horrible death soon, left first, always left<br>first, how long will I feel scared, why do I feel scared about everything, why can't I relax, when will my heartbeat feel at a normal pace again, will I ever be able to stop panicking, will this next panic attack kill me, what happens when you die, i will die soon. I will die too soon. will my life even matter, if i hold my breath will I be able to have more in my life ???????????????????????????????<br>I mean who things about things like that? all the time? it totally consumed me. It<br>controlled everything i did. and especially how i acted. I was so high strung for so many years. looking back on it, it feel like I was constantly choked while my face was turning blue for years before I could breathe again. <br>and I don't remember what it was that changed, but all of the sudden it just clicked and I could breathe again. I felt like I let go of a thousand pound weight I had been holding above my head while trying to keep my head above water for so long. it was the biggest relief. and it was the best feeling ive ever experienced. I would never wish any of those feelings I experienced on my worst enemy. <br>but after all of that, that's when the real hard stuff started. being forced to deal with all my biggest fears I had built up and carried for 18 years. things I wasn't even aware we're there. and constantly being force to think about things that scared me and being forced to deal with it in order to get over it. it was the most intimidating thing ive ever done.  the first day in my therapy session I did nothing but cry the entire time. I couldn't even speak I was crying so hard. all these fears I knew I had, but I had never had to talk about them outloud, or had to understand them. I had because accustomed to them, well the best you can become accustomed to a thing like that. but I had gotten used to it. and then I had to projectile vomit it all up for everyone to see and to know how obsurd I was. and I was forced to constantly go back to it until I could finally handle it reasonably. this took years. years. god it was the longest time of my life. while the whole time, my parents never asked if I was okay. my friends never asked if I was okay. aaron was the only one the, the ONLY FUCKING ONE, and there was nothing he could do to help. so we just fought all the time. when all I needed was support, but instead I had to turn to a group of strangers that had their own serious issues to deal with while I was over here worried about the world ending sand my dad dying. I felt insane, but with that being the case I also felt like I was right where I belonged. but my fears werent even taken seriously until after that 7 week program. not until I started therapy with michael. that's when I was able to let everything go. and we've been working for years now and it's only been in the last few<br>months that I've actually made a real breakthrough. I've made a shit ton of progress and let go of things in the past, but it's only now that I'm learning how to deal with my future. and it's been almost 4 years now. <br>I'm just now learning how to behave, to stay calm, to think first, etc. it's like learning to walk for the first time for me. and it's such a slow process. just the last few months is the first time I've felt happiness since I was a child. it's so sad, which is ironic. haha. but feeling happy is a whole new thing for me. I've never lived a life where I've been happy. I don't even know how to handle it majority of the time. but I love it. maybe that's why i started smoking weed. cause it keeps me happy and in the same mind frame but without the spasms and without it being so extreme. I can feel happy but be calm about it and actually be able to enjoy it with it freaking me out. and now that I'm experiencing this natural happiness, I'm also trying to experience it sober, without medications. and as for this weekend, without weed to. so I have to comfort, no crutch, no stabilizer, nothing. this is all my natural brain right now. and I'm<br>not even sure what it feels like anymore because I've been so heavily medicated for the last 3 1/2 years. Its like I'm putting my toes in the water and it's freezing so I just have to wait and stand here in it and bare it until I get used to it. and I hate cold water. it burns and tingles. and your first reaction is to  jump out, but I can't let myself, because I need this right now. every single thing I'm doing in my life right now is new to me. everything. and my eyes are wide open for it. <br>so yes, at the moment I am emotional. and I'm not behaving as I've become accustomed to the last few months. but I'm trying to create the state I've been in naturally and maintain it, all while still keeping in mind everything will not be perfect, I will make mistakes, I will get upset without it meaning I'm depressed, etc. and this is not something I have to remind myself of every now and then. it's something I constantly have to think about at the front of my mind in order for all of this progress to pay off. because I will NOT go back to where I was. this is my only chance. and. no one seems to have the patience for me. but then again, it's not like all of this can easily be explained or understood or relatable. but like I said, this is my only chance. I'm at the age where I'm naturally maturing and grown up and developing new habits, so before I get caught up in all of the bad habits ive developed or may unconsciously develop, I have to do things right this time<br>so I won't be one of those middle aged adults in a therapy class because I can't handle my life anymore. and this is hard. extremely hard. cause everyone I know is so surface level about everything I know they never even consider things like this all the while I'm constantly battling myself with it. I can't afford to fuck this up. and I know how easily I can but it's not an option for me. I'm too determined and I've worked too hard and cried too many tears and hurt for too long for this all to go to waste. I just wish that someone can understand it or at least respect what I'm going through instead of constantly bashing me for my minor mistakes while they're off being a total hypocrite, PALMER!!! but then again, if anyone were to understand this situation then it probably wouldn't have the payoff I know it's going to in the future. and that's why I try to not let it get<br>to me because I know in the end I'm in a much better place and all of this is for<br>me, not anyone else. I know this will pay off, but geez this is so difficult right now. <br>but tomorrow is another day, and it won't be my last just yet. so im gonna continue to keep pushing to doing what's best for myself. and I know I'll end up happy for it, and that's really all I ever wanted in the first place...</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","even if its just friendship, i want something real.
all my friends treat me like shit.
and the ones i&#39;m the closest to, still aren&#39;t that great to me.&nbsp; they don&#39;t ever call and check up on me. they aren&#39;t really there for me.
but i&#39;m always trying to be there for them.
i&#39;m sick of trying to give everyone advice since they ask me what to do all the time, and then none of them listen to me. and then call me mean and blah blah. don&#39;t ask for my advice if you don&#39;t respect what i have to say! i don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t listen to me, but don&#39;t make it out to where i&#39;m the bad one because you&#39;re choosing to be oblivious to your stupid mistakes!
and yeah, i do get selfish when it comes to friendships. i do tend to put myself first, because i rarely have friends prove their loyalty to me. so why would i go out of my way to do this and that for you when you don&#39;t do shit for me? and yes, it does still make me feel like shit from time to time. but in the end, i always end up alone anyway so i have to only watch out for myself.
and with guys, ugh. i&#39;m so beyond sick of wasting my time. why can&#39;t even of you get it when i&#39;m not interested in you?? and how come all the rest of you only wanna a hook up buddy? fuck that shit. i&#39;m sick of never being good enough. i&#39;m always treated like dirt. and i never do anything wrong. i&#39;m sweet and considerate. and when it comes to guys, i do tend to get blinded and fuck up my priorities about them. and&nbsp; maybe that&#39;s where my problem lies, i invest too much too quickly. and doubt too much from the start.
there&#39;s no one that&#39;s willing to fight for me, but i always try to get them to.
no matter what i do, i&#39;m always second best. or third, fourth, etc. i can never win.
i&#39;m always real with everyone, and i mean anyone and everyone. so why is it no one else can be real?
yeah, it gets me fucking hurt and trampled on all the time, but i&#39;d rather put myself on the line than not.
but lately, i&#39;ve just being trying to enjoy being single. and it&#39;s nice and all. i like it. and it&#39;s relaxing not having to worry about someone else all the time. or being told i can and can&#39;t do this and that. and sacraficing and sacraficing and sacraficing.&nbsp;
but i just don&#39;t like being alone. i don&#39;t like having that much time to myself. it kicks up my anxiety and my self-esteem reaches and all time low. i&#39;m super moody. and i can&#39;t stand to have that much time to think about things.
i try to stay busy and focus on making myself happy and focus on school and whatnot. but i&#39;d honestly rather focus on trying to make someone else happy. and its so stupid to be obvious of that. because it shouldn&#39;t work that way. but i don&#39;t do well on my own.
i guess that&#39;s why i invest so much time into shitty guys and friends, because someone is giving me some sort of feedback and distraction. i don&#39;t want to keep wasting my time on shitty people, but i don&#39;t like this being alone thing. i&#39;m not used to it. this is the longest i&#39;ve gone without a relationship and the enjoyment of it is beginning to wear off rapidly. and that scares me. because i don&#39;t want just some cute guy to walk up and me get all stupid crazy just because i&#39;m longing for a companion.&nbsp;
i&#39;m trying to stay level headed about all of this. but it&#39;s getting difficult. and i REFUSE to just run back to another ex. i&#39;m so over doing that.
hopefully my strength and confidence will build back up, but i&#39;m feeling weak at the moment. which in return, increases anxiety and less strength and confidence. which then again leads to stupid stupid decisions.
this is my chance to break this cycle, and i&#39;m really trying hard.&nbsp;
as i see it, this is my last year to live my life, i don&#39;t want to spend it making regrets. i want to spend it making unforgettable GOOD memories.&nbsp;
and maybe somewhere along the line i can find love again...but chances are slim. and that doesn&#39;t need to be my goal.&nbsp;
so back to trying to stick to my motto:&nbsp;&nbsp;
COME WHAT MAY.."

"event","<p>is chaos.my current situtation: <br>I have no money. <br>I have no power in my apt. <br>I've been staying at johnnies parents house for 2 weeks now. <br>I haven't showered in days<br>I have no clean clothes. <br>no deodarant. <br>hardly any gas in my car<br>I haven't been to class in over a week. <br>might still be going to court with the apt complex cause we still aren't sure if they've been stealing money from us. an we need a clear case in order for them to decide to pursue the fraud case. <br>I haven't had my meds in almost a week. <br>I'm definitely failing my classes.I'm over 2 weeks behind my deadlines. <br>and if I fail another class that means I'm suspended from memphis for a whole semester/year. <br>the only money I've had I stole( I felt it was justified but still doesn't necessarily make it right). <br>my mom hasn't talked to me in weeks. <br>everytime I go home I'm ignored and blown off. <br>the clothing company is going nowhere currently. <br>blah blah blah. <br>Tony is trying to get back with me. <br>the only reason I would do that is if I were a complete moron. yeah, the money would be great. no financial stress. but the rest of it isn't worth it. and I just don't feel the way I used to about him. I just feel sympathetic for him. but I'm not in love with him. not even close. and thank god I'm finally over him. ugh. 6 years too long. I hate<br>being mean to him<br>and hurting him, but I have to be honest. and I have to be true to myself. I don't want anything from him. and I'd never be happy. <br>Aaron, oh Aaron. I don't know what to do with him. I feel like I'm holding onto him cause I still hope we'll have a future. and I actually think we could. but he's too hurt by everything that's happened and he'll never let it go. I could so easily be all about him again. he's the only person I think I could ever marry and be happy with forever. but I don't think we'll ever get the chance. he's gonna be gone for years still and so much will happen in that time. we'll change even more. and the thought of him in war gives me nightmares. I just know he'd never come home to me. and I could never survive losing him while he was overseas. I would still love for us to have that, but I feel like I'm just being unrealistic. and I can't handle getting my hopes up. it just feels like a lost cause, especially when hes still thousands of miles away. we'd never get to work it out. <br>but with johnnie, he keeps me grounded. yeah, he does a lot of shit that gets on my nerves and sometimes I just want to walk away, but I could never do it. I need him too<br>much. he keeps me thinking realistic. and I don't take things for granted with him. he inspires me to do art, and that's hard to come across. I feel like I just need to milk it while I have him around and push myself as an artist and see how much I can progress. like a mentor. and maybe we'll never have a future, shit, for all I know this could be all over next week. but it's what I need right now, as long as it lasts. not even relationshipwise, but just personally. I've never met anyone like him and I enjoy learning him. I feel like he's not human, cause he doesn't act like any I know. but anyway, I feel like I'm just going nowhere fast with him, but it's worth it. it's probably dumb, but I know it's all gonna pay off in the long run. </p><p>but good things to look forward to:<br>we're getting a house this week. bad news- I hate our roommate. but I'll deal for now. <br>I have a beautiful truck that I'm slowly but surely gonna start restoring. she's gorgeous and I'm so in love:). <br>and, that's pretty much it. </p><p><br>Halloween is gonna suck. <br>my life needs to improve!! quickly please?</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

I just know in my heart that I could make you happy. and I don't want to give up if I still think I can show you that. I know that physically I don't need you to survive, but mentally I'm fucking dying for you. I don't get how you can do this to me. thats why I know this isn't just some little shit. this is serious. its hard enough for me to find someone attractive. and harder for me to have feelings for someone. but when it's there, it's there. and there's nothing I can do about it. I wouldn't long for you the way I do if this weren't more than that. I've only had feelings like this for two other people. and although I'm not in love with you, I love you. I could fall for you, but you haven't let me yet. I just know how beautiful things could be with us and it kills me that I can't have it. because I know you don't just find shit like this every day. or I don't at least. maybe it's best that I just give up. stop wasting my time. stop getting myself hurt and being stupid. but no matter whats right or best for me, I won't listen to it. I just want to fight for you. I have all the reasons not to but I can't hold back. my feelings for you are so much stronger than they were and all of this has made me realize that. and now that I know, how am I supposed to just let it go? I can't. I only have one current desire, you. but what the fuck does it matter anyway?

or if it's even real.
but i feel happy.

i finally don't care about you.
i don't care what the fuck you want.
i don't care if you want me.
i don't care to cuddle with you
or please you.
i just don't care.
i care about you, but not about ""us"".
i've told myself not to before, but this is the first time i actually don't.

it's pretty pathetic that you're so dependant on other girls to make you feel good about yourself.
you're constantly fishing for compliments. and yes, a lot of them do come to you without a reason.
but you still jump on that shit so hard. it's like you need it to make you feel like a person, or feel of importance. everyone wants to be wanted. but you need it too much. you of all people i wouldn't expect to care about other peoples opinions. but goddamn, you really do think that low of yourself. i don't know why you see that. you're so oblivious. and honestly, stupid. all you really want is for someone to make you feel like you're set apart from every other guy.
and i've just been fucking sitting around day after day trying to convince you that you are a great person. but you just do stupid shit and say condesending things as something to fall back on. because it's what you think people should expect from you. but it's not really you. i've known that you hide behind shit, but i've never really realized to what extent it actually is.
and the more i'm realizing it, the less i want you. i don't want someone who's afraid to be who they are. and can't stand up and take fault for their own mistakes. someone who can have a heart and not be afraid of it. i know you know who you are, for the most part at least, but these facades you keep formulating are getting out of control. you're a total hypocrite. and i dont even think you realize it. 
at least with me, i've never tried to be something i wasn't for you. i never tried to be some hardass chick cause that's what you like. from day one i've put my heart out on the table for you and i've never made excuses for it. i've told you exactly how i felt and why i felt that way. you're the one that chose to believe/trust it or not. and you're the one that's chosen not to want it. i've done everything i possibly could for you. i've tried to be there for you. to talk to you. to get you to open up and prove to you that you could trust me.  i've tried to prove to you that i've trusted you. but all that i've done, even though it's what you're looking for :the company and affection and blah blah, it's still not good enough for you. and if that's the case, then nothing/no one will ever be good enough for you. you're always gonna have these ridiculous standards you want them to meet. or you want someone that's gonna treat you like shit because you feel like that's what you deserve. when actually, you deserve better than that. because you are better than that. you deserve someone who will be nice to you. who won't talk down to you. who doesn't think that you're a piece of shit. someone who can accept you for who you are. someone who knows you have flaws and that there's been shit in you're past that's effected you and fucked you up, but they still don't see it as a flaw. you don't get that that shit just makes you fucking human. it doesn't make you less of a person. let it fucking go. that shit was in the past. you chose how you take it now and what you learn from it. but all you've taken from it is that you think it's better to be fucking cold and bitter because then no one can expect anything from you. you can't be a disappointment. well shut the fuck up. who cares if you've been hurt by girls in the past. who hasn't been hurt before? and yeah, maybe you're dad was pretty fucked up to you and said things that should never be told to a child. but people do shit. people fuck up. and then life goes on. just because you didn't do shit right in one persons opinion doesn't make it a fact. there's a ton of other people that would totally disagree with him. but you're too fucking stubborn to listen. because you have ""trust-issues"". if you can't let shit go then you're just gonna stay right where you fucking are. thinking you're just meant to be alone and never amount to anything. why don't you show everyone that they're wrong?? why do you make something good out of it? use it as motivation to be a better person than you already can be.   because this whole shit about you trying to act hard and emotionless, all that's done for me is get my hopes up. because i expected just that from you. and as soon as you show one sign of weakness, like being sweet or sincere, and you willingly show that to me, that just makes me believe that somehow i'm important enough for you to share that with me. and that's just not the case. i am no more important to you than some fucking stranger you pass in the mall. and that's the same idea everyone else is gonna get to. but it's all a fucking lie. it's decietful. but if you actually had the balls to be sincere in the first place then things wouldn't get so misunderstood and taken the wrong way.  you're just setting yourself up in the weird ass circle trap thing. and it's getting you no where. because just like it has with me, it's gonna piss people off.
now i know for a fact i've done enough to deserve better than i've gotten from you. you treat me like shit. you just keep me hanging around because you've already let me in. you've let me in more than you ever wanted to. and you can't take it back now. you need the company too much. and i'm too willing to provide it for you.  i've already let myself get into this situation where i'm just a fucking back up. i'm just here for whenever you have no one else to turn to. i'm here whenever you can't get some girl to come hang out with you or fuck you at the moment. i'm here whenever you come home from fucking some other girl. i'm always here to comfort you. and to keep you from stressing out. and to provide for you. and blah blah blah. i do too fucking much for you for you to just treat me like a fucking doormat. or more like a dirty fucking bedsheet.  
and yes, i love you. and i meant it. i know undoubtly that i meant it when i told you. 
but i feel like it's changing. because i don't deserve this.
i deserve someone who's gonna treat me with respect and compassion. someone who will be excited to see me. someone who will pick me over other slutty ass whores. someone who will want me and only me, not just when it's convenient.  someone who can have feelings for me and tell me about them. someone who doesn't have to hide who they are. someone who is pround for everything that they are.  and no, i'm not searching for this person. at this point, i'm so worn out with you i could give a fuck less to find a relationship. i sure as hell am not about to go put effort into anyone who does not put effort into me.  i've realized that i really don't need other people to make me feel good about myself. and i definitely don't need it from you as much as i thought i did. because there isn't anything wrong with me. i know i'm a good person. and i'm happy with who i am. i have no reason to be fake. and i know that i'm good to other people. i'm loyal and dependable. and i do nothing to not be respected. i'm not going off and doing stupid shit. i'm not looking for attention.  i just wanted to you. just for wanting you. for no other reason. not for attachment reasons or any of that. just for who you are.   but i don't think you deserve me. i think i've been too good to you. and we could've been great together. and you know it. i could've made you happy. and i sure as hell would have never treated you wrong. and i still won't even now. but i'm so over wanting you. i don't want a one sided relationship with you. i'm fine with just a friendship. 
i think that after this point, a lot of things will be changing from now on. 
actually, they have to. for me. because from now on, i am my only priority. no one will come before what's best for me. i'm getting myself out of this little rut i've let myself get into. i've been here for too long.  now, this is about my happiness.
and i am finally happy."

"event","but i feel like somehow or another it will be.
i think i've officially blown my chance.
but it shouldn't be this way.
this whole situation is so unfair.
you know, all i wanted was to be wanted. to feel like i'm not just some other girl, to feel beautiful. 
and you just couldn't do that.so someone else did.
and you know what, it still wasn't good enough.
i can't believe i would even consider picking you over him.
and i still can't even have you. 
i'll just be waiting and waiting for something that will never happen.
but i guess your friendship just matters that much to me.
because even if i can't have you, i still can't bare to have nothing with you. 
i'd rather love you and not have you than not ever see or speak to you again.
so what if it leaves me hurting. i need you more than that. 
why the fuck do i need you? i have no idea. i don't even know what i get from you. but i just need you around. cold. bitter. whatever. it doesn't matter. you're still what i need right now, somehow, for some unknown reason. 
and i don't think i can ever stop hoping that more could come of this. but i'm gonna try. because even though you may not need me, i don't want to do anything for you to not want me.
i could just go settle for someone who could give me what i want. be affectionate from time to time. be happy that we're in public together. have him be proud to be with me. and think that there's no one who could be better than me. someone who wants to tell me how they feel about me. someone to talk to. and to listen. someone to hold me at night. and to hold my hand when i'm afraid. someone who actually loves me. 
but i can't just settle. and it could even mildly make me happy. or give me a false sense of confidence.
but i know i can do better than that. and i'd hope that you'd want better for me.


all of this is just so wrong.
i don't think this is how things are supposed to be.
and i dont know what to do to get them on track because i don't know what direction i even need to be going.
but i know for sure that choosing him would be the wrong choice. 
so now i'm just gonna go back to wondering aimlessly until i find some sense of direction. and if happiness seems to find me, then so be at it. but at the moment i dont see it in the near future.
i don't see a future for me at all.
i can't recall another time when i've felt so unsure of my future.
or not given a shit about it. 
but right now, i don't. 

i just have to focus on myself again. 
i guess it should be easier this time around."

we wont end up together.

its not supposed to work that way.&nbsp;
i don't want to have you if you don't want me too.


as far as everything else,&nbsp;
she said i'd be successful.
i'd work whenever i wanted to and be able to travel.
i'll be out of here soon and move somewhere else.
i'll have 2-3 pregnancies and only 1 child.
i'll have 2 guys and 1 girl that are always close to me.
i'll have love and money in august, but i don't think it was referring to relationships.
anyway, she said i'd be happy and content.
and that's all i really ask for.

but for now, i need to go back to accepting things for what they are.
stop putting myself in a position to be hurt.
and just relax and enjoy myself.

we'll see how this goes."

"event","I have been wanting recently to revive my learning of Spanish.  I have been out of practice, and found an opportunity the other day to use some Spanish with a client that didn't speak English very well.  (I realized this when she just kept nodding her head and saying ""uh huh"" with a blank stare on her face as I explained using various terms in English how her dog needed surgery to fix its leg). I just ordered and received Rosetta Stone Spanish for Latin America, and it's great!  Yeah, it's expensive, but I think it's great.  I only ordered the first segment (there are 3 for Latin American Spanish), but I think I will be ready to order the other two soon seeing how I've blown through the first 2 parts out of 5 already, and I just got it yesterday and started with it today, after work...

If anyone is needing to learn a new language, I would already recommend their programs."

I don't know what's going to happen when she leaves in 2 weeks...  Basically, I'll be running the practice by myself because Dr. Williams, mentor of mine for a lifetime, bless his heart, cannot help much.  He's ready to retire.  He needs to retire. 

I really hate working there anyway, and I want to leave.  I don't know what to do.  And to top it all off, I have an interview with another clinic in Winston-Salem this weekend and I haven't even discussed things with Dr. Williams.  He has no clue I'm so unhappy.

"event","I need to sit down with someone and discuss my life.  I hate my job with a passion, and I feel like I would be much happier elsewhere.  I love being a veterinarian, but not here.  All of my classmates I've talked to love their newfound lives.  Meanwhile I find myself slipping deeper and deeper into depression.  And I know its all because of my job, because of where I am (far away from my friends), and because I have no time to enjoy what little life I have left.  I can't do anything without thinking about work.  It makes me sick at my stomach every morning to drag myself out of bed to go to work.  I sit there and try to think of excuses not to go in every morning.  When I'm on call, I flinch when the phone rings.  I am on edge every minute of everyday.  Even on my days off, like today, as the day wears on, a feeling of dread builds in me knowing I have to go to that hell of a place again the next day.

It would be so much simpler if I could just change jobs.  But I can't really do that since I've signed a contract for a year, which states that I cannot work as a vet within 25 miles of the area for 5 years after the contract is up.  I also cannot work at the other places that offered me jobs because they are either within the 25 miles or they only do small animal work.  I have a state loan that I am paying off by working with large animals (a work-forgiveness program).  Not to mention the county is paying for my student loans right now as well.  If I leave, all of that is gone.  I can't just expect Carroll to move either, as he has an established career as a paramedic here.  And although our place is falling apart, it's at least a roof over our heads that we own.  I don't know how we could pull off a mortgage without being married.

But I guess I should just suck it up and be miserable.  After all, it's my own fault, I made the choice to come here."

My drink is pretty good, though.&nbsp; If you like fruity drinks, you should try this one.

It's called a ""sour candy apple""

1 oz vodka
1 oz sour apple schnapps
1 oz cranberry juice
1/2 oz butterscotch schnapps
Put into a martini shaker with ice, shake and serve.

It's good.&nbsp; I'm drinking a double."

"event","Ok, so in my last post I was bragging about how I had designed a new userpic on here.  Well, now that userpic's original file is GONE from my computer forever.  I signed on and wrote an LJ, then I updated my Norton Antivirus, and then IT happened.  My computer started fucking up, so I thought, well maybe it just needs to be restarted because it has been running for 3 days straight without shutting down.  So, I told it to restart, then walked away.  Three hours later, I returned to my desk to find my computer restarting over and over and over and....

Shit.

Anyhow, to get to the point, my hard drive was fried.  I lost ALL of the pictures, music files, games, etc. I had on my computer from the past 3 years of my life because I'm a freakin' idiot and never backed up my files.  Luckily, Ryan was good enough to help me get my computer back running (for now anyway, at least until it goes dead permanently), but all of my precious memories are gone.  This truly sucks. Let this be a public service announcement to back up ALL of your files periodically.  I've learned my lesson.  I just hope I can get another year of use out of this computer before it permanently goes on the blink.  Until then, I'm backing up all of my files every week at the least.

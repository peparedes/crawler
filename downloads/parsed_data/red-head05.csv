Moore at the mall to get t-shirts for our ""uniforms.""&nbsp; So I was gonna drive my car, Em hers, and Mandy hers.&nbsp; Them two leave while me, Elyse, and Allison, walk to my car.&nbsp; I put my key in the door and turn it to the right twice, my door unlocks, theirs don't.&nbsp; <EM>No biggy</EM>, I think to myself.&nbsp; So I get in and try to unlock it from the inside automatic locks...no go.&nbsp; <EM>Hmmmm</EM>, I think.&nbsp; <EM>I wonder what's wrong?&nbsp; </EM>So, in goes my key into the ignition.&nbsp; Turn.&nbsp; Silence.&nbsp; Turn.&nbsp; Silence.&nbsp; <FONT size=4><EM><STRONG>OH, MAN!</STRONG></EM></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff><U><FONT color=#9999ff size=4>So that was the beginning, of not such a long story.</FONT></U>&nbsp; Anywho.&nbsp; Elyse goes and gets Travis while he's practicing with the units, or whatever they're called in ROTC.&nbsp; Travis supposedly has everything we'll need, says Elyse.&nbsp; So Travis leaves his group and comes over with his car.&nbsp; He's got the cables, but the battery is nowhere to be found.&nbsp; Ugh, who puts a battery under all the stuff under the hood?&nbsp; So Matt Comer comes over with his big, honkin' truck and opens the hood.&nbsp; Travis and this really nice girl are hooking up the two batteries (me, alli, and elyse are about 10 feet in the clearing of any of the cars) and my battery wants to be dumb and try to shock the poor girl.&nbsp; <FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG>Stupid batttery</STRONG></FONT>, can't it tell when someone is trying to be nice?!&nbsp; So they hook mine up first and try to hook Matt's up second...still some shockage.&nbsp; Hmmm...what to do now?&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#009900>Now enters two random guys smoking cigarettes and in a white car.&nbsp; They're very quiet fellows, I do say.&nbsp; However, they pull out this yellow plastic box with jumpers connected to it (later I'm informed that it is called a <STRONG>starter kit</STRONG>).&nbsp; They hook the jumper cables to it, and a second later one says, the only words they will say the whole time they're there, <STRONG><FONT color=#ffcc00 size=5><EM>""Start it.""</EM></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;I hop in and my baby starts right up!!!&nbsp; YIPPEE!!!!!!!&nbsp; So, exits the two mysterious smokers and away they go on their horses off into the wind.&nbsp; Well, not really, but they were very mysterious.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Anyways, I took my car home and the great Emily Berrier turned around and came and picked us up at my house!&nbsp; How great!&nbsp; Off to the mall we went and came home.&nbsp; My dad and I took my car to Pro-Care and now it's in the process of being <FONT color=#000000 size=5><U>cured and re-oiled</U></FONT>!&nbsp; So, that was my afternoon and it's only polite to ask, </FONT><FONT color=#ff99ff>""</FONT><FONT color=#ff99ff>How was yours?""</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>So then comes the part about going to college and meeting&nbsp;new people.&nbsp; I think that's what makes me the most excited.&nbsp;<FONT color=#3366ff size=5>&nbsp;I LOVE THE PEOPLE I KNOW</FONT> <FONT color=#3366ff size=5>NOW,</FONT> but,&nbsp;I&nbsp;like the feeling of meeting&nbsp;people that aren't&nbsp;like me and then the&nbsp;task of finding those that are.&nbsp; I'll&nbsp;def. still stay in touch with others, and&nbsp;a lot of friends are going to&nbsp;App, or at least thinking about it, so that'll make it easier.&nbsp; There are other&nbsp;bonus' to&nbsp;App, like:&nbsp; free skiing on Monday nights,&nbsp;there's no freshmen 15 (i guess it could be called negative freshmen&nbsp;15), new people, new adventures, lots of snow (hopefully not too much), and the joys of the mountains!&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, talking about this stuff puts me in a&nbsp;good mood!!!&nbsp; </FONT></P>

"event","Hi. Um...remember me. I guess I'm gonna post now. Just so everyone knows, I am getting married to beautiful Emily A Fields (soon to be Mrs. Weedman)this saturday Oct 7th. And let me just say this, you learn a LOT about EVERYBODY planning a wedding. I have learned...
1) That Emily really is my best friend, and at times it feels like my only ally
2) Certain friends/family members who mask themselves as ""well-wishers"" and ""supporters"" really only care about their own selfish interests.
3) Just because you are 50 or older doesn't mean you can't act like a toddler in the toy aisle.
4) Emily is gorgeous when she cries from happiness. I am ugly whenever I cry for any reason.
5) Some people don't understand that others grow, mature, and progress to a different person than they were 3 years prior. (Eg my mother still says I hate to eat anything green because she thinks it's funny. In reality I often go through Vegetarian phases because it increases my endurance and cuts my weight for fights. And I miss spinach.)
6) There are those in the business world who prey upon emotionally fragile brides-to-be and they should all be choke slammed one by one. By yours truly.
7) Hanging around my in-laws makes my protective/savior complex flare up and makes me glad emily and I are honeymooning on the other side of the globe (japan. Woot.) This way nobody can contact us. Only us to them.

All in all this has been a good experience, but it's fun to write these things out to vent a little bit. Who knows, I may start up on this whole ""blogging"" thing again! In the meantime, I just started the myspace craze. Join me?

There are two pieces of Brent-things that are note worthy.
1) I have a mohawk. I'm serious.
2) I fight in Evansville on May 20th. 730 CST (830 Louisville Time)

If I get 10 people from Livejournal to go, then I will keep the mohawk for all to see. Tickets are $15 from me, $5 cheaper than at the door. And a portion of all my ticket sales will go to yours truly, so come on out and KEEP THE SCENE ALIVE!!!!

You may remember me from such websites as ""livejournal.com"" and ""hellojapaniamyourmostawesomeking.com"" I have the internet now, so you may occasionally be blessed with a pos t of mine. Proper thanks may be shown by way of financial donation. My most recent developments are as such...
Emily and I got a great new townhouse of of westport road...and a new dog named fletcher.
My fighting addiction has taken on new heights. Current MMA record...5-0-1
I have lost over 28 pounds since may. I am skinny.
I am in the best shape of my life since training tons and tons of kettlebells (google it ladies).
Politically, I am preparing my soul to vote anybody in as commander in chief before Hilary Clinton in 2008. This is including, but not limited to...
lucifer
the chupacabra
kimbo slice
dave crowder (the drinker, not the singer).
She makes me feel the way Bush v2.0 makes you all feel.

AAAAAANYways...there is a ufc special on right now. You should all be watching it now.

"event","Um...hi everyone. Sorry I dont post much. I'm a busy guy. And I dont have the internet, so I only use it at my parents. Here's an update.

1) I fought in an MMA tourny (in a cage) July 2 in a four man 205 lbs bracket. I won both fights by strikes on the ground.
2) Chuck Liddel's manager (www.ufc.tv) is coming to meet me in August. He might start setting up fights for me.
3) I'm still engaged. Emily is happily tied up in the closet of my bedroom. (She has books to keep her company. Mostly pre-approved histories of the third reich.)
4) I'm a manager at GNC now. Its in lagrange, which sucks a little.
5) My grandmother (Dad's mom) died thursday morning at 3 am. She knew the Lord, and is in a better place than in a run down old body that didnt hardly function anymore.
6) I will make an effort to reply to people who write on this post. SOrry about the absence.

Love to everyone except hippies and the french,

"event","Ok, so I have been pleasantly surprised by a few posts/emails asking for an update to my life. Here goes...

I moved out by myself, Dustin didnt really want to because of school possibilities. 
I work two jobs now, the usual UPS and i went back to GNC. I am planning on quiting UPS after this semester to go into GNC management. 
I am still in school full time, bringing my average school/work week to a meek 64-70 hours. 
I am still madly in love with Emily. I <i>will</i> be marrying her.
I will most likely apply for the police department in june or july :::crosses fingers:::
I have only been training during the rare times that I am not working. I work out mostly with some cop friends of mine, which is cool because we fight with knives and take the slides off of guns and train with those. (*FYI at this point, anybody who pulled a gun on me would be signing their death warrant)
I am very disappointed in most of my old friends. So here is what I have decided to do, and have been doing for a while. People that I care about deeply are acting exceedingly immature and dangerously, and destroying any desire I would have to see them. So what Im doing is allowing them to live foolishly and still have the gall to wonder why they are depressed/feel like they have no direction whilst I sit on the sidelines. Because I would rather miss out on their company now and wait for them to outgrow it (God-willing) than to hang out with them now and be so disgusted with them that I forever lose any desire to see them again. My prayers are with these people, and I only hope they grow up before hurting themselves or somebody else.

Its all kinda cliche until it happens to <i>your</i> friends. Ce la vie. (sp?)

I sincerely hope that all of you find and live a meaningful existance. God Bless.

Then we went to Jillians, because some of her friends were there. They were all really cool. I drank with them. A lot. For the first time in over 10 years, I got sick.

Second a kick to the face. I felt really bad, however, because they were REALLY great guys, and they both had to go to the hospital. I saw the first guy later that night at the after party, and he had 7 stitches. He said the other guy had a broken nose (which I just found out dustin captured on tape when he stood up. Its NASTY) and a concussion, but would be fine. I made a lot of great connections and good friends. Just doing my part to put Byakuren on the map.

"event","How's everybody? I have been busy to the maxxx and havent seen many people lately. Here's something stupid, I have friends (no one in particular is on my mind) that as soon as you get busy and cant hang out as much they stop liking you. They assume that I think Im too good for them. Isnt that funny? So here's my schedule, for any potential naysayers.

Work: Sunday-Thursday 10 pm-630 am
Sleep: 730ish am-1/130pm
School: Mon-Thurs 2 pm-530pm
Karate (officially): Tues 70-930
Add about 2-3 hours of homework a week (most from my JA 521 class which is a writing course. At least 5 pages a week, plus working on a 20 minute lesson/6 page paper on the Jim Bakker ""Praise the Lord"" white collar crime case). 
I go to church about 3 times a month, and hang out with Emily whenever possible (usually because I see here on campus and/or for a few minutes before I go to work). 

So, naysayers, I still love all of you. But its hard to split time with all of your friends between Fri/Sat nights only. Plus, I have little to no interest in going to a party and getting shitty <b>every</b> weekend. And Im sorry to say this, but many of my good friends arent as much fun when they're drunk. They're more...whats the word...one dimensional. I wish drinking wasnt as cool right now. Hopefully the pattern of my friends will follow suit as it always has. Something becomes THE thing to do, they do it every available moment, then it dies done to moderation and we sit around and laugh about when we used to be SOOO into it. Examples...drinking, poker, about 1 million different bands, ect. 

Lots of love to everybody. 
Emily makes me happy and actualizes all of the potential I had to be a man. 
Love,
Brent"

"event","Today the paper <a href=""http://www.courier-journal.com/localnews/2004/12/13ky/B1-shoot12130-5644.html"">reported</a> about a 75 year old man shot and killed by Officer John Grissom. The poor innocent victim's brother refered to the police officer as a ""trigger happy cop"" and said he ""hoped to hell"" that the cop could live with himself. Let me tell you why that officer can and should be able to live with himself. The 75 year old man had his girlfriend around the neck in a classic movie headlock style with a knife to her chest. Officer Grissom was at high ready (weapon raised) about 9 to 10 feet away ordering the man to drop his weapon. Stating that he would ""kill the bitch,"" the poor innocent victim raised his knife quickly towards her neck, and Grissom shot said poor innocent victim in the face. He shot him in the FACE over the girlfriend's shoulder. Holy crap. What a shot. I would like to shake this man's hand and want to be the first person on the block to call him a hero. I am never happy when a situation ends fatally, but in cases like this the right person died. And thank GOD that Chief Robert White FINALLY stood next to his officers stating ""I believe this young lady's life was probably saved as a result of the officer's actions."" Thank you Chief. Now where was that sentiment when Detective Mattingly protected his own life? The sooner this community (or any community for that matter) starts thinking of these criminals as the dirt that they are, the faster we can get this proverbial ""ball"" called community policing rolling.

PS-in other news, the girlfriend was more likely a prostitute, but I didn't get that info yet."

A christian huh? Go figure. But coming in at a close second....cult. You may call me ""Brother Brent X."" I would like to state for the record that I am unshamedly and unapologetically christian, but I AM ashamed of most christians that I run across. For you history buffs, remember when the teachings of Jesus were a MOVEMENT? A REVOLUTION? Not a BUILDING or a DOGMA. Oh wait, its still like that in many places of the world. There are statistically more martyrs of the christian faith today than there has been over the last 2000 years. But here in the good ol US of A, most christians are too busy wading in the pool of self righteous cow shit to actually demonstrate any true love or compassion for anyone. Fuck I have to stop talking, because Im going to get myself mad. Im going to sit here and wait for the call from my ""special friend."" SHHHHWIIIIING!

He beat me in what was a very close/controversial decision after the second round. I didnt fight my best, however I did kick him in the head once that staggered him. But for whatever reason I didnt get the wazari. I was pretty damn disappointed, but Judd went on to be the only foreigner to even place in any division (4th place heavyweight). Hes won a TON of taikai and was a home student with Mas Oyama for three years starting in 1990 (With NICHOLAS PETTAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!). But anyway, this is budo. This is life. Im young, strong, and stupid. So I need to go back to training. I think Im going to enter Enshin Karates All World Championships that are held in Denver at the end of april.

Let me staight one painfully obvious truth, America did NOT get shortchanged. Am I a Bush fan? I would say no. Did I vote for him? Yes. It honestly came down to the sheer ambiguity of Kerry and the fact that I dont trust him any more than Bush. HOWEVER!!!!!!!!!...Bush won the POPULAR vote as well as the electoral votes. This means that while YOU may not like it, 52% of the country did. Welcome to democracy. For all you who say ""Well IM not happy about it and neither is anyone I know"" are just as self serving as you claim Bush to be. A part of me (albeit a VERY small part) wanted Kerry to win so that I could say ""Now I will lead by example and suck it up to support my President and wish that he does great things."" But he didnt, Bush did. So lead by example and suck it up to support your President and wish that he does great things.

"event","Let me tell you a story. Football demigod Brett Farve mentions preseason that his team (the greatest ever, by the way) are going ""Super bowl or Bust."" The last time Farve said that was 1996, when the Packers won the Superbowl last. The Packers would start there season in 2004 with a challenge, defending NFC champions the Carolina Panthers at Carolina. The Packers lacked defensive depth and Farve is getting a <i>little</i> old, but came out impressive, defeating the Panthers and absolutely smothering them with a ""take no prisoners"" smash mouth defense. The next game was arch rivals the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field, the Mecca of Football (and maybe of all professional sports). No problem, right? Wrong. Not only did the Packers lose to Chicago, but also the Giants and the Titans. All at home. The titans held the Pack to 17-0 in the FIRST QUARTER, the worst start of a packer game since 1990. (They also had time to sneak in a loss to the Colts at Indy into their busy schedule) The pack were 1-4, 0-3 at home, the worst start in well over a decade. So when the time came to play the surprising 3-1 Lions AT Detroit, a certain Karate Master was less than optimistic. The opening quarter was about what was expected. A dull 7-7. After briefly falling to 10-7, the Packers went into halftime leading 17-10, which slightly lifted my spirits. The game was close until the third quarter, when Darren Sharper intercepted a pass and ran it back 36 yards to the house. 24-10. The Lions were done. The Packers ended the game 38-10. ""Old man"" Farve was 25 for 38 and 257 yards. Ahman Green ran for 81 yards (the most against the Lions this year) AND <i>threw</i> a 20 yard TD pass in the fourth. You read that right. THREW. So now I am both confused and very happy. I guess that the Packers just need a challenge to perform. Um...I guess.

So in closing, everybody with me now............

We will start with Kamakura Daibutsu, Meredith. THis is simply a large buddha statue, and many cities have one. This one is in Kamakura, hence the name. Fun fact!...Once last year pranksters painted nail polish and six pack abs on it.

At another shrine in Kamakura, you can buy these wood plaques and make wishes on them and the priests would pray for them. Mine is in the middle (yes, in japanese. Buts its pretty rough!) I wished to be the heavyweight champion in November, my best friends is on the right, wishing to be the lightweight champion in November. His wife is on the left wishing for both of our wishes to come true!

A small girl in her traditional summer festival hapi (like a robe)

Me in mine. That color blue (the sash and towel headband) is the color for the area of Kisarazu I was in. Each town has their own color.

The shrine we had to carry. (A couple thousand pounds by the way)

Me carrying it. It sucked.

One of my best friends kids. Her name is Leah, but spelled different. She looks just like ""Boo"" in Monsters Inc.

See? (Cue girls ""awwwwww!""ing)

Me and Genki Sudo. Bitches.(There are other pics I have with other famous fighters, but none of you would know them. Drat.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v199/everydaydave/Japan1112.jpg"">
At Kamakura Dojo. The guy on the right is Kawai Shibucho (Shibucho means the head instructor of a dojo). Hes pretty famous, and real real good. The guy on the left is his father, Kawai Shihan (Shihan means the head of all the dojos in a section of the country) Hes real old, and real real good.

My good friend Masanori Mochizuki. He lives in Kisarazu, where I did the festival. He speaks amazing english, and he is Black belt in Byakuren.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v199/everydaydave/Japan2007.jpg"">
Minami Takehiro. The man, the myth, the legend. I would call this guy a friend, but I wouldnt want to insult him. He and his wife consider ME a friend, but he is my hero. He is also like my personal instructor. This pic was taken at his dojo, about 30 minutes from Headquarters, which I traveled every tuesday and thursday.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v199/everydaydave/Japan2008.jpg"">
Minami and his wife Yoko. She is very pretty. This was after my last night at their dojo. Minami is very very nice, and very very scary. I will tell you a story later. (He threw a guy out a window)

Before
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v199/everydaydave/Japan1122.jpg"">
After. With Hazama Kancho. (Kancho means the head of a style. He is the head of Shinmei kaikan.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v199/everydaydave/Japan2016.jpg"">
The best for last. Me and Sugihara Kancho, my ""grandmaster."" He is absolutely amazing, and could kill you with his pinkie toe. Hes also a hell of a cook. (See below)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v199/everydaydave/Japan2001.jpg"">
My farwell party. Kancho makes a Korean dish called Nabe. One of my favorites. His nabe almost kicks more ass than he does.

"event","Ok everyone, time for some group participation. Ive finally got all of my pictures from Japan on here. What do you guys want to see? My friends? My instructors? Me and Genki Sudo? The options are limited only by your imagination (and by what I have pictures of). Please respond, I would love to show them off, but there are too many to simply put them all.
Brent

Edit:Other options...my dojo, my roommate, my friends kids (the daughter looks JUST like Boo from Monsters Inc), a shirtless before/after pic to show the weight I lost, etc"

"event","I just wanted to make something clear for those who do not see me very often. Just because I am not posting here very much doesnt mean that I am sitting alone in a room and sulking. (Not that I have been accused of that, Im just saying). I want you all to know that I am still Brent, nobody can take that from me. Without sounding too ""preachery"" or anything like that, there are a great number of things in my life that I hold dear and answer to that are much bigger than myself or my problems. Not the least of which are my God, my father/mother, my Karate, my <i>true</i> friends, my passion for life, etc. While a lesser man might sit and mope, feeling sorry for himself and generally just being annoying, I will press on. For I truly believe that ""suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope."" This is not to say that I am ""over it"" or will never be sad again. But with thanks to the character that I have gained (see above formula) I hope for the best. That last post was more of a purging of my feelings than a state of mind. I <i>do</i> feel wronged and hurt, but that is not who I am or what I live by. I have never crawled through life feeling sad and depressed (maybe if I did I would be a better musician! ZING!) So to review, I am me. I am Brent the Karateka. I fight and train to better myself and my mind. I serve a God that is bigger than shitty problems (Dissenting opinions please be respectful). I am blessed with parents that understand and talk with me, whilst pushing me to be better. I am happy by default, because being ""depressed"" is the exception, not the rule. I love everyone that was/is there for me when I need to talk (Meredith, Jamie, Im looking at you two) or party/laugh (Dave, Dustin...Woot). Please guys, when we have problems, lets not just pity each other. (IE ""I know how you feel bro! Once I dated this girl for two weeks, and she TOTALLY broke my heart!!"")(*Side note:Nigga please.) Lets encourage each other to do what Johnny Cash says: ""Press on."" (Yes Joe, I know its a Nam reference. But I wasnt IN nam, I just listen to Cash) 

In the words of Butters ""Id rather be a whiny pussy than a faggy goth kid""
But lifes too short to be a pussy


Moving forward...never looking back,
Brent"

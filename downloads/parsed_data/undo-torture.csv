"event","man, it's been a long time.  i guess i've become more irresponsible or something...

i went to a really good show tonight.  bullet blue sky's first show was awesome.  they sound like they've been playing for 3 years.  i was very impressed.

school starts up again on tuesday.  i'm almost out of high school.  i don't really know what to do now;  it feels very strange to be unsure of my future for the first time ever.  i'llturn out fine, but i don't know which path to choose.  this is how life works, i suppose."

"event","i'm back in town.

there's always a vibe i get coming back to tampa.  it's as if there's a sadness, or a tension, that comes with the humidity.  i was hoping to turn this trip into a new thing for me, but all of a sudden i'm back to my old self again.  i hate this place, more than i ever realized.  i may consider moving to a place where i can be myself, not what i need to be to keep up appearances.  i liked what happened to my head up north.  i liked the way i felt being there.  but most of all, i liked the cold.  i liked how i seemed to fit, even if i didn't.

my brain works differently here

there's a book everyone needs to read.  it's called nothing feels good: punk, teenagers, and emo.  it's by some writer for spin magazine, and this guy is so in tune with young people, it's scary.  i am spellbound."

"event","i woke up early.  i don't really know why.  it was as if my brain decided it was done sleeping, and i should get out of bed.  of course, the other, rational part of my brain kicked in, and i fell back asleep.

i think it would be cool to know what makes people suddenly wake up.  i've woken up after dying in dreams.  i don't actually die, but me, the character of the dream, reaches the conclusion of the story, the denouement so to speak.  and i suppose the dream itself dies along with the end of the story.  some of the stories have been pretty cool, and i can remember a second consciousness in the middle of the dream, i'm guessing my conscious self, thinking ""hey, this is a badass dream, when i wake up, it's gonna suck if i don't remember it.""  

have you ever noticed that our conscious and unconscious selves take turns speaking?  for me, at least.  they never interrupt each other, or interject, or anything like that.  it's weird to me that two different sides of my personality are so polite to each other.  i know that me, zakk, the goofy kid you see in the hallways, is pretty damn rude sometimes.  i like that at least some part of me is trying to be nice.

ok, time to go shower, then explore washington d.c. for a while."

"event","it's freezing here.  as much as i love millwood, there's always a part of me that hates it here.  it's 6:15, and it's been completely dark outside for over an hour.  i feel like i should just be sleeping, but i should probably do something about my psychology notebook, which is way behind schedule.

there's a part of me that hates going back.  back to the shit i left there. friends. enemies.  a job i'm sick of, a school i hate, a future i'm not sure of.  i don't want to leave where i am, but i want to find something new. something better...maybe i've just been in the cold too long.  it's too fucking freezing here."

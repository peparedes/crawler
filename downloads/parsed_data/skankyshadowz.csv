I think I'm getting a promotion. Which is kinda cool, except then I'll have a butt load of work to do. It actually might be kind of nice to be busy again. I really like doing online classes they give you tons of time to get stuff done. It's not like oh it's due by noon, it's due in a couple days and what not. It's cool. 

The baby is with my mom for the weekend. He's so cute! She loves him. I'm so excited for Becka's baby! She's naming her Lana Marie Christenson."

How we live is very different than how their mom lives and what they are around constantly. I hope it will be good for them. We're taking them to church with us. I'm a little curious as how all of this will turn out for him. His mom's family really talk down about the church so..I dunno. It could be really interesting. 

I hope all goes well though. These kids really need a good influence. It's hard taking care of other people kids and my own newborn though. I think everything is starting to way down on me. School, kids, work, etc. I'll make it through though. This is definitely what I want but it is really hard."

Going to church really makes a huge difference in my life. i don't know, it seems like everytime we decide not to go i get depressed and everything starts to just start to break down around us. I like it so much better when we can communicate and be on the same page, and i think this is the first time in a LONG time that we have been on the same page. It's great.

Cole is doing well. he's 3 months old, and he is full of smiles! He's the happiest baby ever. He's teething though and that gives him a bit of a difficult time. But still he doesn't really cry all that much. When it hurts he's just a lil' fussy. He's such a joy. He's so full of giggles and wow it's just amazing to have such an innocent gift from god in your home. 

I work full time and go to school online while Billy goes to school. It works really great though, he's doing awesome in school and i work at this job where I sit at a computer all day and do practically nothing except my homework. It's great. They pay me $11 an hour to do homework."

"event","Yeah, he's the most beautiful baby in the world. All biasness aside, he's gorgeous. 

It's weird staying at the hospital. I was released Sunday night but I'm boarding here now because Cole is still in the ICU. I get to keep my same room, they just don't cater to me anymore. And I can leave whenever I want. 

Cole is doing better. We had some serious frustrations with some of the staff here but we're good now.  We talked to management :) Now, it's like everyone is super nice to us...and it's not like we were rude but honestly, if you aren't charting my babies care and if you think you can just do whatever the hell you want to my kid without my knowledge, I'm gonna throw a fit. He's finally out of the isolette and in a crib, he's holding his temp, he has no more IV, just the feeding tube now. That's all we have to accomplish before we can go home. He has to be able to 50 ML orally in a half hour for 48 hours. Right now he'll eat on me for about 5 minutes then take 30ML from the bottle. So he's doing ok. My milk finally came in..YAY, it makes you feel good when you can actually feed your kid. It's weird though, cuz I can feel it sloshing inside of me when my breasts are full. It's funny. 

I'm doing better. I hurt like hell still. I definitely think that ripping down ""there"" is probably the worst thing that can happen to someone. OH, when they gave me stitches...I thought I was gonna die. They gave me a walking epidural so I could still feel sensations and most stuff except it cut my contractions in half, but everything when the baby came out and the stitches after, I could feel 100%. Trust me, you don't want stitches down there!!! My back still hurts WAY bad too. Even with the massive amounts of Loratab they have me on. Where they gave me the epidural kills too. They had to stab me 5 times with that stupid needle. By the time they were done I wished I'd just stayed with the contractions...but 3 hours later I was glad. When my contractions spiked 90 and were only 30 seconds apart...yeah I was happy ( to give birth contractions should only be around 60-70 and be 2 minutes apart). 

I feel so bad that I'm not spending more time doing things for Billy. Gosh, he's just done so much for me since I went into labour. He's stays here with me and he just caters to me. I wish I could do more for him. I don't know what I would do without him and I surely don't ever want to take advantage of him ever again. He gave me a beautiful little boy and for that I owe him everything. He's so good with Cole too. He just loves us and it just shines through his eyes."

"event","My baby is here! YAY! He's totally adorable...he looks like the splitting image of Billy. It's really weird. He's adorable though. He weighs 6lb. 3oz., he's currently in the NICU..which is sad because he's got all these tubes and stuff. I have to use a breast pump and then they give it to him in a feeding tube. He was about a month early. He was born on the 4th at 11:18 pm. I went into labour at 11:00 pm on the 3rd, so I was in labour for 24 hours. I lasted 19 hours before I got the epidural! I was so proud of myself. There's no way I could've done it without Billy. I could've done it all without the epidural if I hadn't had back labour. That was rough. I really thought I was gonna die there for awhile. Then about 3 hours before I delivered I spiked a fever and the baby started to get stressed. We were gonna have to get a C-section they had me taking the preparation medicine and signing the papers but then Cole finally dropped....wooo. We didn't want a C-section. They had to use the section on him though, because my cervix refused to fully dialate. 

My water broke around 10:30 AM but my body wouldn't produce enough of the contraction hormone to dialate me fast enough to get Cole out before he was susceptible to infection, so they had to induce me. Then the stupid nurse (we didn't like her) ended up having a external monitor on me that really sucked so it wasn't picking up my contractions so she just kept raising my hormone levels so my contractions were WAY strong and WAY close together. When the doctor finally came he was like, whoa turn her down! So I'm really proud of myself for doing as good as I did, but my body wasn't ready to dialate so that was an issue. They decided my water broke because my placenta had a bacterial infection. They don't know what it was yet, but I've been on anti-biotics for 24 hours now and so has Cole. He couldn't breathe on his own when he was born, he had to be on oxygen after they suctioned his lungs because he had so much fluid in his lungs. It was so sad. I'm really upset that I can't be with him more because until he shows interest in food they have to keep him in the ICU and until they find out what kind of infection we have, we just have to stay here and that really sucks. I just want my baby. I want to take my baby home. I want him to stay all night with me. I want to take care of him. I feel so protective of him. He's so beautiful and I just love his guts. I sure hope he's ok. He's been doing so much better though. He's breathing on his own and holding his body temp."

"event","Yay! We have an apartment!! I'm so ecstatic. We didn't get the one we had hoped for so we went driving around yet another day to try and find one. These ones I had said I wanted before (but weren't available) had a for rent sign in front of them. So we called the lady and she was like oh my husband is already at the apartments go find him. And we found him, and talked to him and we got in the exact same day! He even gave us a break on our deposit because the people had just moved out the day before and he hadn't gotten to all the cleaning yet. 

Which was fine, cuz I have this total nesting urge right now and I can clean for hours and be content. So it was great. Billy has been getting after me for doing to much stuff...I didn't listen to him at first (i'm not crippled, I'm pregnant) and now, after all is said and done..I think he's a pretty brilliant guy and I probably should listen to him more. I'm so sore! I can hardly walk! I know that sounds like an over exaggeration but it's true. When I stand up I have to move my leg with my arm until it remembers how to work properly. 
Word of Advice: When 8 months pregnant do not try to sit on the ground. It makes getting back up VERY painful. 

Contractions feel like a major pressure has built up behind your ovaries and all of a sudden the pressure shoots of like a gun and it's hurling your ovaries straight through your body. I'm sure at any moment holes are going to appear and big gooey globs of ovaries are going to fly out. It's pretty painful, and these are just Braxton Hicks so who knows what the real ones will be like."

Something that no matter what has to be said about it, it will just hurt feelings and make people angry. I didn't think that could happen in our relationship. We were so close. Were...I guess...is key. I just don't know how to act. A lot of people say it's good to have your own secrets in relationships and to not completely open up and to hold back certain things. But what if you know it's the other person with the secret? Them who isn't opening up when you have. Perhaps that is why they tell you not to, so when you do find out that the other person is hiding a secret it doesn't bug you because you have your own secrets. 

It really bothers me that it's ok for him to talk to her but it's not ok for me to talk to him. It just doesn't make sense to me. He would be so hurt if I talked to ""him"" but it's all right for him to be there supporting and comforting ""her"". I don't know why I thought this could ever work. It's like, when he was gone I was so focused on the fact that I had to have him back. That I had to have him in my life and I just couldn't do the split parent thing. That wasn't how my life was supposed to turn out. But is this how my life was supposed to turn out either? I guess I just sort of have to pick the lesser of the two evils. I do love him more than anything in the world...but is that enough? Really? I know that people have fights and dislike family members all the time and some will even stop speaking to the other family member for like 20 years. But can I do that to someone? I can demand that of someone? And if I don't, can I live with the opposite? Seeing the happiness and love they share and knowing how much they really shared...can I live with that?"

My puppy buster almost gone ran over by my mom today. It scared the living crap out of me. I saw her start to back out and then remembered that buster was still outside and I saw him running towards the car and I screamed Buster and luckily Billy was outside and told mom to stop just as soon as Buster ran under the car. We think he might've hit his head on the tranny or something because he yelped but he was fine. He's running fine and still a cheerful lil' pup. It was way scary though. 

I'm staying with Billy at G-ma's right now....supposably we're gonna get an apartment sometime. I don't know, I really want to unpack my things and have my little nest ready for me and the baby. My stuff has been packed away for four months now and I'm sick of it. 

So apparantly they might let Joe and Ash off on probation or whatever. I don't really know how I feel about that. I support Billy because I know he's his brother and the only real family that he has left yet everytime Joe is in our lives colorful things tend to happen.

I've missed Billy a lot. I'm currently staying with him at grandma's and the whole job pending thing will determine whether or not we get an apartment. So that will be better.

I do love him, and I do think he's surely special but there's so much crap in our relationship I just don't know how we're going to be able to do this. I need some serious therapy or something. I'm just worried that if we get back together nothing will have changed. He swears up and down that he didn't relapse and that he didn't have an affair, the only problem with that is that half the stuff I've heard about while he's been gone would have to be not true, and some of his behavior is just unexplainable if he wasn't using again. So I'm really trying to be able to trust him again but if things aren't explainable that makes it a little bit more difficult to trust someone. I don't know.

A girl because every man wants the son to be THEIR son and so if it's a little girl it would be easier to deal with knowing that the woman hadn't given some other man a son.

or...

A boy because men connect better with boys and they are low maintenance. I mean, if I won't go outside and play b-ball then the little boy will..

since he's suspended in fluid...cuz that takes a lot out of it...so, my kid is gonna be a world class soccer player. 

I went to dinner with Billy the other day. It was strange because it wasn't strange. It was seriously like nothing had changed. We sat there and laughed and made fun and held hands and stuff...then it was just over with and he went back to grandma's and I went home. It kind of bothers me that he chose to be a good pot head instead of a good husband and father. It really makes you feel rejected when you find out the reason that they left and won't come back is because they want to keep getting stoned. Which of course, I'm not ok with. If they raid our house or whatever I can get in trouble to. I can't expose my child to that. It's illegal. They act completely different when they get high. They don't care about having a job or taking care of the family because their only worries is their next hit. 

Did you know that kids up to 4 years old can actually soak up THC from sweat. It's like these kids don't even have a chance. Their parents are getting them addicted to it. How messed up is that? What kind of person would I be if I just put up with him getting high all the time and letting him live with me and the baby? Plus, I don't think he wants to come back either...he's like trying to protect me from it but at the same time trying to NOT push me away. It's like I'm some kind of sexual reserve or something. I just wish....he'd stop and come home where he belongs. And go to rehab and counseling and just let it go. But it's harder than that I guess. It like holds on to them, and becomes the most important thing in their world. Everyone tells me I can do better and move on and what not...
But it's hard to believe that when the only person you want is a crazy drug addict who doesn't want his child and wife.

It's weird how you can chalk two and a half years of love into a month of ""we didn't like it each other, we loved each other, that was never a problem, but we didn't like each other."" I don't know. I think he's on drugs. He's turned into Mr.Hyde all of a sudden. I don't know, it's just one of those things you have to accept though. You can't make someone love you. And it only takes one person to leave. 

Deciding what to do with the baby is really hard. Everyone has a separate opinion as to what they think is right for me to do. It's really hard to try and make everyone happy when no one seems to be able to agree. I've decided that I'll just do what's right for the baby though, but then again easier said than done. 

I figure I have two choices: give the baby up for adoption, or find a way to keep Billy away from him forever. 
Billy is a really unstable, unreliable, and jerky kind of person sometimes. These things I'm just beginning to realize have been prevalent through our whole relationship. He didn't treat me very well, alot of the time either. I can't have someone like that trying to teach my son to be a man. His addictions are a real problem as well...my son will probably be vulnerable to such things because it seems to be in their family's genetics. So I can't have him exposed to that when he's a very young child now can I? That wouldn't be right for him. But in the state of Utah, the father isn't allowed to completely sign over all parental rights to a child because it's called basterdizing the child. ( Billy was willing to do that though...it's sad, it's like he just doesn't love me or Cole) So I can move to a state where that can happen and just pray he doesn't go completely psychotic and decide he wants the child all of a sudden before I get residency. OR I can just give Cole up for adoption which I think is really stinky, because we were married and had been for a year, when we conceived him. And at the time of conception we were both very excited and very much in love. Plus, I think I could raise such a cute little gentleman. It will be hard though...I've done the parenting thing before but this will be different because he's mine. And I have him full time so....I just don't know :(  I want him..."

"event","Billy decided he wants a divorce. It was really weird. Just completely out of the blue. We had argued on the ride home from tooele and he started to just yell at me for ridiculous things. I told him that I didn't deserve that and we just sat there pissed with Anthoney in the back seat. 

We got home and I felt really emotional and Billy doesn't like it when I get emotional and angry so I told him I think he should leave. So he did. Then he just wouldn't talk to me for a couple days and was just like we should get a divorce. And I told him it was crazy to do that with everything we've been through and everything we've been working on in our lives and expecially since so far we've been doing good except when we tried to move back in with mom to buy a house. Then the house didn't go through and Billy wouldn't get a job and we didn't have insurance for the baby and me and we both got frustrated and then WHAM! let's get a divorce. It's really happening too.

We talked to the lawyer today and he's filing the paper work and we have it set up that I'll get the child when he's born. (OH it's a boy!)As long as I don't ask Billy for child support. Which is really hard, because now I'm stuck living with mom. Like I have to if I want to have a relationship with my son and go to school. I guess I could just go to school and work so we could have our own place but then I would also have to just have a baby-sitter there ALL the time and I wouldn't even know my own son. It's kind of sad, I feel like billy is abandoning us when I'm 5 months pregnant. I guess it's better now though, so the child will never think it was his fault. If he left right after he was born I would think that would be harder on the child. I don't know though. I guess it shouldn't have been surprising everyone told me marrying him was a bad idea in the first place. He was a perfect husband for about six months of our year and a half marriage. I guess that's pathetic. I've just come to the conclusion that he just wasn't able to love me like I loved him. 

Everyone keeps telling me I'll meet someone else and fall in love but It's not about who will come into my life it's about what I just lost. My bestfriend, husband, father of my child, and my love. He was my other half and I feel partially dead inside."

My sister told me that I act like a little old married women. 
She's older.
It was kind of weird, it made me think a lot about people. 

I wondered why I didn't call 'ber and hang out or take her the present
that I got her...I called her a few times but after playing tag for awhile
I just gave up but it wasn't because of that. I worried we won't have anything
in common anymore. I think it would be easier to avoid feeling like that. 
I'm married and pregnant and extremely boring now. I'm probably just paranoid,
because nothing would've made me happier then getting together with everyone!
Elise, Erica, Sythan, Kimber, and so on so forth. We all had so much fun.
Like that one time at Kimbers when a hundred people were there (it seemed) and
we played catch phrase and it was awesome. Everythings different now though...

so much that billy started asking me if i was pregnant which of course
I would scoff at and ignore. 
Then I was starting to get a little sensitive in odd sorts of places, i'm sure you can imagine,
again we just joked with each other about it. 
I had a left over pregnancy test from when I took one that other time (the advanced kind that can detect it before your missed period)
So in the morning the other day I decided to take it just for kicks
I didn't expect anything from it or what not.
So I peed on the stick and set it next to me as I waited for 3 minutes. I looked at it and was like huh negative. Then A couple seconds later I looked at it again and it had two lines instead of one. The second line was kind of light though, so I was like hmmm...so I grabbed the package and it said that the second line tends to be lighter than the first if it's in the beginning of your pregnancy.hmmm....
So I went into the bedroom where  billy was sleeping and woke him up. I showed him the thing and then we just kind of sat there. We decided that I should probably go to the doctor to find out for sure....

My sisters were in a car wreck. They were going to Becka's open house in tooele when they ran into a dead stop on the highway. Tamara barely had time to swerve out of the way so she didn't hit the car in front of her. Then they were stopped and Tamara looked in her rear view and saw this focus cruising down at like 70 mph and not slowing down. So she looked at Cho and said ""we're gonna get hit"" and turned the wheel so she'd fly into the median. And they flew. THey just had whiplash though so it was cool. The guy who hit them just barely got his license...sad huh. It totalled both cars. The pretty convertible mustang got it's whole back end smashed in and the trunk and the door won't open and the whole frame is completely shot. The focus's whole hood was completely demolished with everything else. The boys weren't hurt to bad though. lucky"

"event","So Billy still hasn't sold his car...which is fabulous because we keep making 200 dollar payments that we really can't afford...but it's all good. I haven't been able to get my GED Transcripts because they are lost in the mail...not very happy about that. The college contacted me and said that they would have to delete my classes if I don't get those into them. Yikes. Not to happy about them being lost in the mail. I can give them some slack though because we did just move twice. 

Gonna miss my friends. It's already really different though. Ya know when you can just feel like you've grown apart..yeah it's like that. It's all just a memory now and that's kind of sad but we did have lots of fun together so that's cool.

This guy my sis liked before he went on his mission, just barely wrote her after nine months of not writing. He comes home next month. Well..as most of you know she's engaged to be married in September..well in his letter he practically set up a date with her (he obviously had no clue she's engaged). I think she's kinda torn though, because she loves Phillip but she loved this other guy for years! I think she'll definitely pick Phillip though because she most certainly couldn't stand to break his heart. I just think it's horrible. What a tough decision! For everyone else out there don't marry someone because you feel obligated!! There is no OBLIGATION in getting married!"

"event","So all is going well...
Billy isn't cheating on me...we have this awesome loving relationship...he's not high all the time (i've given him drug tests eh)....he's not smoking...he got his teeth fixed...got accepted to school...I'm losing weight...we're taking ballroom dancing together...

So we went to orientation at the U. It was fun but really intimidating. So there is no way I will be out of there in 4 years. Nuh uh. Not even with summer school. I found my major though. Medical Laboratory Science with a minor in 
Nutrition. So that will be cool. He's taking Computer Science so we'll make big bucks together. Not like that matters though it's really just what we want to do. So it just worked out cool. 

My mom bought me this killer new lap top. It's bad. I got 2nd in the nation on my reading and language arts scores. And I got 3rd in science..so that will help with the whole Science major thing. My mom is even paying for us to go to college and our rent so we just have to work to pay for food, insurance, and to goof off. So that's cool. My mom bought a whole bunch of apartment buildings in Cali. and is turning them into Condos and they already have buyers for them so that's awesome. And I got a grant...so I'm set!"

"event","Why does everyone think I had a baby? I mean I was in school in april if I had a baby don't you think people would've noticed? Or these people who actually think Anthoney is mine....don't you think if I had a baby at 15 everyone would've known about it a long time ago? Yeah...retards."

"event","So Anthony is havin' troubles. All of a sudden he is afraid of EVERYTHING! I walk outside and there is no way he will walk by himself..he throws a fit. Then when you pick him up cuz you're in a hurry he will barry his face in your neck. And you can feel him shake. Then when we put him to bed he just freaks out! 

So last night I asked him why he was scared and he was like I just am! So I was like ok that's fine but nothing can get you. You are ok me and dad are watching out for you and if anything comes and scares my anthony they are in big trouble. Then I was like are you a big boy? Can you go potty by yourself? ""yeah"" Ok then you can tell whatever comes and scares you to just GO AWAY! ""Can I point at it?"" Yes. And tell it to go away. 

SO he started doing that. Then fell asleep eventually. Well I was talking to him today cuz he was running around with the blanket over his head wimpering and I was like what's wrong buddy? And he was all I'm scared. And I was like of what? And he was all the boy. SO I'm like hmmmm..odd...""what boy?"" 
""The boy in my room.""
So I say,""Does he come see you? Does he talk to you?
""yes""
hmmmm...spooky, ""what does he say to you?"" 
""I can't remember""
hmmm...suspicious, ""Did he touch you?""
""umm..no""
Phew..hmmm, ""Did you talk to him? Or is he just to scary?""
""Yeah he scares me""
""is he here right now?""
""No only at night.""
ok that's a plus, now I don't have to be scared, ""you can talk to him buddy, I'm sure he won't hurt you.""

So totally sixth sense creep fest. I don't know what to do. I looked up a whole bunch of child psychology stuff and a lot of them said to have the child act out with dolls what is going on. So I got a couple dolls and I was like ok Homer Simpson is Anthony, and the Frog is the boy. So we started playing and he would just sit there and hit the Anthony doll with the frog. And giggle. So I don't know what to think."

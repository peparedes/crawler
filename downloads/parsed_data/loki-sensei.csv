"event","you know, i get back and all i get is the same old treatment. after a long time of non posting here, i just decided to do so. anyway, what happens when you try to be nice and all you get is ""you fucking bastard"" and ""leave me alone"" because of something that was ""obviously"" (everyone notice the "" marks) your fault? i'll tell you, you get pissed, you get angry, and then...you just try harder. the world is not partial to anyone so guess its left up to some choice or few people to ignore, forgive, forget, accept, encourage, and always try to be fair and understanding no matter what happens to them. becuase if we all held shit against a person for life, then we would all be hell bound and left with nothing but a miserable life being angry at someone who doesnt even realize or carry the same feeling. eh, that is all."

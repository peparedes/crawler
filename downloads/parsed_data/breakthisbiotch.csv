"event","<P>i am back. better. and bitchier then ever. no more private blogging. i can care less who reads this shit. yes i am very moody right now. so what.. shoot me. please excuse my language.</P>
<P>okay so heres whats happening. i meet guy. i fall for guy. stupid EX-friend backstabs me and tells the guy's best friend that i like him. guy's best friend tells guy. ruins everything that i worked for. guy avoids me. guy's best friend hates me. jealously maybe. whatthefuckingever.</P>
<P>the first question i have for you is.. why? why would you go behind my back and tell <EM>my</EM> secrets to <EM>her</EM>? why.. when i confronted you.. did you not only lie about it but change the whole goddamn story? i know exactly what happened and yet you deny it and tell me something entirely different. and your reason for blabbing my secrets out? i would have understood if your reason was ""sorry it was by accident"" or maybe even a ""i wasnt thinking clearly i'm sorry"" would be sufficient. but you didnt even say sorry. <EM>you</EM>, as you put it into words so well, said ""what was i supposed to do? <EM>lie </EM>to her? shes one of my best friends!"". its funny how a year ago you used to call me that before popularity got into your head. first of all.. its not like she even asked you who i liked. YOU were the one that mentioned it. not her. so therefore it wouldnt have been lying if she never even brought it up. SECOND. even if she did ask, you could have just said no. even though its a lie, its not like its hurting anyone right? if she was a good friend, she would have understood anyways that you were sworn to secrecy and you couldnt tell. but noo. you didnt even THINK about the consquences of your actions. THIRD. since when the <EM>hell</EM> have you ever cared about ""lying to your best friends"". heck, you do it 5 times&nbsp;a week. hmm lets see.. remember this monday? you talked about your best friend when she was like 2 feet away from you and heard every freakin word you said. and then you denied it when everyone around a 6 feet radius could CLEARLY hear you. god do you think we're stupid or something? FOURTH THING.&nbsp;okay now i'm gonna start yelling. <STRONG>HOW THE FUCKING HELL COULD YOU DO THAT. YOU DIDNT EVEN THINK FOR ONE GODDAMN SECOND HOW IT WOULD EFFECT PEOPLE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW FUCKING HARD I WORKED TO GET TO KNOW HIM AND NOW YOU FUCKING RUINED EVERYTHING THAT I PLANNED. GOD, YOU DIDNT EVEN <EM>THINK</EM> THAT WHAT YOU SAID WOULD HURT ME. ALL YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT WAS YOURSELF AND HOW IMPORTANT IT MAKES YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GOSSIP. I FUCKING HATE YOU. I WOULD SO KICK YOUR <U>ASS</U>. BUT THEN YOU, BEING THE PANSYASS THAT YOU ARE, WOULD PROBABLY FIND SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR YOU INSTEAD. WHATEVER. YOU BITCH. JUST DROP DEAD AND GO&nbsp;BURN HELL.</STRONG></P>
<P>okay i feel better. sorry mandy, i think i accidently deleted your layout ^^"".</P>
<P>oh and sorry for being such a bitch to you. even when i was such an ass to you when you were hurt, you were there for me when i needed someone. thanks for caring :) and i'm sorry for ignoring your problems.</P>"

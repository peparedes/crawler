"event","Well I haven't updated this in a while, and i figured well its since its 1:20 in the morning i might as well update this shit. I mean, Tommy boy is funny and all but I'm still hyper and bored. And these hickory smoked bbq chips kick ass!! Anyways so this week was boring, and gay. Lets see monday i missed the morning thank god cuz i felt like shit on sunday, and the week was boring from then out. Bowling kicks ass, and that was pretty much the highlight of the week till today.
  school pretty much sucked today, and it all started out pretty bad. I overslept so my dad comes in at 6:30 screaming i overslept and my mom told the carpool to leave without me. So i jump into my clothes and 10 minuted later my moms ready to go, apparently looks matter when your just sitting in the car dropping someone off at 7 in the morning. So mr. asshat, shitfaced, bitch tit schnyder locks me out. Thanks mr. schlong sucker. Lit sucked, hell was boring, satans changed from the last time i saw him and apparently he was a siamese twin......Chem test sucked, damn you german bastards with no lives. I think we need more hookers in the world. I mean seriously, if we had more hookers, these little duesch bags that live with their moms *cough* curtis *cough* wouldn't sit around all day, inventing shit we don't need so we can take tests over it that we don't want. lets skip ahead to study hall, best part of the day. Especially since im supposed to drive right? I mean i get to skip hoar hoar's study hall and i get to drive, the easiest thing in the world. But wait!!!!! Mr. DICKLESS Bitch tits decides he hasn't pissed me off enough so he cancels the driving EVEN though i bumped into him earlier today. Great, so now i have to sit through a study hall, with no books, with hoar hoar loving everybody and abby trying to flirt with the freshmen and then moving on to the stoner seniors who lost their privaleges.

Lets skip ahead to tonight. I actually didn't feel like goin tonight, but i went anyways. We were missin a few people specifically someone who's birthday is tomorrow *cough* nate jon-ASS. The movie was.......interesting. Grant and i figured out the secret of the movie makers........acid. After the movie i hear someone call my name, i figure its probably someone saying ""brain"" and im just to hyper to notice....but holy shit its april!!!!!!! WOOO!!! She had her hair spiked or somethin, it was all sticking straight up on top, it looked friggen awesome. I think i should come in to school with hair like that and then shave my head monday afternoon and walk in with a buzz on tuesday. Or at least some different hair cut. Yea thats right i said cut, not style. Not that im particualarly fond of some rubbing up against my head with some damn shears, but Id rather have a little snippy snippy then eating my fuckin hair everytime i lean down to eat some damn fruit loops. ANYWAYS............................................................................... So april had awesome hair and she was there with her friends. And cal brought some luthwanian (yea def. spelled that wrong)   dude and he wanted to take a picture of em, but i had to drag one of em back in the picture. Dont worry april, we'll get her more social. hah yea bullshit im a loud person..... So lets see then we went to bp while nate and them were at pancheros. I got no fear and grant and derek got some vivarin, but we didnt take any :(. Man i thought i was wired before the no fear but damn that shit hit the spot tonight cuz im still hyper :)

Actually now that i think about it, im gonna get some gel shit or beees wax or somethin tomorrow.....errr today and spike my hair. Maybe I'll visit april too. Anyways, I'm gonna go watch Harold and Kumar, then maybe play some vice city on ps2 later all"

"event","Well its that time of the year again. Girls are out shoppin there asses off, guys are lookin for single friends, and the rest of us are just, well whatever. Its the month of fawktober.....er hawktober. We've gotten our wonderful little shirts, we've gone our walk of the year (as if we don't walk enough in school) and now the best week of your friggen life is comin up. Homecoming week. Time for random days where we dress up in clothes that somehow relates to a theme that half the people don't want. I for one am truly excited. Oh, and one more blast of good news, from what I've heard, were gonna be breathalized or whatever. So no one go drinking before you go to prom. Cuz i know you all drink *rolls eyes* actually i think thats just a message for one person, who shall remain anonymous.

Alright now that im done rambling about next week, time for a play by play of this awesome (and short) week. lets see hrm de hrm hrmmmm.
ok brain fart. can't think of shit. I think i'll just blame it on tony......and mrs. wawers. For having to listen to both of them I'm stupid. Damn you!!

alright few random things stuck in my mind:
:+:one being when i freaked jessica and nate out when they were in nates car (oh la la). Derek, matt, and tony pussied out. (at the last home game)
:+:another being someones discovery of flicking bottle caps. Now dR j won't stop. whoever found this out, im going to kill you. =D
:+:yet another being, yesterday, when my neighbors and i were so intelligent. Daniel laughed at anything (which is what he usually does anyways), zach was just being zach, random, spazzy, funny. I was messin around hitting zach and other objects on the counter with my hair and i forgot about the counter and slammed my head into it....that hurt. And we towl whipped cheryl, she got shot (in a dirty place o.O use your imagination perv) with an airsoft gun, oh and there was also her little blonde moment.....all I'm saying is my balls showing through my jeans is not called cameltoe.
:+:Tuesday, victory is mine. I trapped nikki behind the railing (muahah i win) and april hit me in the face with her shoe. I then proceeded to throw it out by the trees in front of school. =D im so evil
:+:Victory is yet again mine, nikki left her backpack all alone and i threw it in nates locker. We got her to say fuck 3, count em, 3!!! TIMES! and we got it recorded
:+:VOTE FOR PEDRO......or pete kw
:+:I made a fuck sign for nikki and allys locker
:+:jimmy:""so..uh...coach...have you decided what the teams will be?""
coach:""doesn't matter jimmy, your not bowling.""
^^ Almost as funny as when jimmy got mad at dan jensen for telling the choir bitch he lied about his grandma and was really at bowling....almost.

thats all for now, and remember. NATE WANTS YOUR BOOBS (if your a guy...)

ADD A COMMENT DAMNIT!"

"event","First off, reminder to everyone. Its nikki's birthday today so tell her happy birthday damnit!

Anyways...been awhile, so i figured id jus post about this.
Highlights of the game:
- tony bitching about nate and then running off when he came over to teds truck.
- jimmy attempting to insult ted by calling him skinny and making fun of him for running....jimmy got shot down
- Dereks canadian.
- Emily braided my hair o.O crazy shit man
- Caitlin punched Blake in the balls. I think she needs to pay him for the loss of all of his kids and his grand kids
- We've discovered why girls are always single. There lesbians when there single but since they don't want to come out of the closet they just stay ""single""
- Dipn dots are ice cream! - zach
- Ashley has been appointed to Captain Obvious
- WE should like make a video thats likes this.....is grinding - ashley or sarah i dont remember
- sarah and blake had dipndot wars
- Roncalli SUCKS we killed them. yay now we get donuts.
- one last thing. Its funny how we bitch about having to wear uniforms and shit, but then like half the girls were wearing the uniform skirts.....odd

Ok so the game was fun and shit, but we were missing two people tonight. Everyone knows who I'm talking about. April and mike. It woulda been way awesomer cuz second half of last game we were just walking around and there were people along the softball fence makin out and shit and we were asking them if we could join in and shit. April dared mike to streak over to the fence by the neigborhood for 5 bucks and he got half way and he saw two dudes. Anyways it coulda been way cooler tonight, but noooooowe need some asshole pricks to tell the counselors. If i ever find out who the fuck told there fuckin ass is mine. You wiill die. K I'm done rambling.

"event","I guess people actually read this o.O I've had not a bunch, but some people telling me to update it but i don't know what to do. As some of you have noticed its kind of half and half with some of it being about me personnely, what I've been doing or where I'm going but other stuff is just like issues that annoy the hell out of me. Well right now, since wednesday for most of you and me, school has begun. The only person i know who was happy to be back was Cal, for reasons unknown, I hate school. I dont like chemistry. I dont like literature. I dont like geometery. I hate world history. But the two classes i hate most are theology and spanish II. Chemistry is stupid right now, mainly just because of ms. Waaaaawers. Not WAW-ers, no its a long a children. Everyone should agree that teachers that are too obsessed with rules suck. And wawers is a perfect example of that. Since she was a chemist or whatever for some medicine company I guess rules are really important there, but there are some differences between medicine and highschool isn't there? I mean when people are getting there teaching degree they should be tested to see how they react to situations, I think thats what makes a better teacher. The more a student hates you, the less they'll want to do what you say and the more they'll fail, and they hate you even more. I think if we can find a balence between uptight and laid back we'd have good teachers, and believe me they exist. Moving on to literature.....only one main reason i don't like this class, I do not give careless about why some assmunch from 1000 years ago, in a language i don't even understand, wrote about. That being said, mowing on.....Geometry, the teachers ok, but I'm surrounded by little frosh. Thats ok, I don't speak unless spoken to anyways, and the only people who usually speak to me are the teacher or someone who unfourtunately for them has had the horrible fate of being paired with me to do God knows what. Oh wait, there are a few sophs in that class, jessica sits right in front of me. Regardless, I still don't give two shits about a point, line, triangle, trapezoid or any other shape/chart/graph. And now we're at Lenz. Oh lenz lenz lenz lenz......Where to begin......Oh I know, she loves to hear herself talk ALMOST as much as she loves ""prehistory"". Although i am bored out my mind in that class, its ok because everyone else is too so when she asks us a question no one realizes she did till she keeps saying ""Anyone?"" and shit like that. I like her little ""Expert"" cowboy hat or whatever, but thats pretty much it. I can't really say anything else as we haven't really gotten homework. Ok now my least favorite class mainly because of the teacher. Theology. With the Hoar. So far we've had an assignment every night from him. And he played stairway to heaven, saying he just felt the urge to write a song when he woke up. Dr j figured it out the first actuall day of classes when he said ""HES A FUCKIN HIPPY."" I guess its just how hes so soft spoken, cheerful, like he tried to hard to be abnormally happy, all the time. And he just loves to work so he thinks everyone else does to. I swear i think because he doesn't have any honors theology classes and he wants some, so he just acts like all his regular theology classes are honors. I can't really bring out my true hatred yet tho, because the school years just getting started. After more and more painful days with 50 minutes of hell with him I'll be able to fully describe my hatred. And then theres Spanish. Ok its understandable we have a lot of immigrants, and a lot are hispanic. I'm fine with them having jobs, and them living here and everything, but I'm gonna go back to the ""hate your teacher"" thing. I'm half and half on this situation because I know we need to learn it but also at the same time its just like ""FUCK OFF. We don't even want to take this class, this stupid school is forcing us to. If they want to live in our country they should learn OUR LANGUAGE!"" And thats wrong and right at the same time. Its right because when you go to mexico or spain unless you have a tour guide, you'll be very lucky to hear some english. Its all spanish. But also going on that it'd be so much easier if whereer you went once they heard you speak english theyd stop speaking spanish and start speaking rough, but understandble english. My last comment is on study hall. I think teachers should just be there to make sure everyone isn't screaming or breaking stuff and to sign passes so people can go do stuff. I mean if its study hall, but you can't go get your books then there like forcing you not to do anything. And then they get mad at you because you have nothing to do. But they still won't let you get your books. There solution is ""durrr maybe you should consider taking a different class instead of study hall since you have nothing to do."" Sometimes i feel like telling her (eck) WHY DONT YOU GET UR FUCKING HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS AND LET ME GO GET MY BOOKS SO I CAN DO MY HOMEWORK, WHICH IS ALLL I WANNA DO BITCH. But nooo i just sit there and do what little homework i have in my backpack. Thats what i was looking forward to this year, being able to have a study hall so i wouldn't have shitloads to do at home.

Other than all of that schools fine. Just need a _few_ adjustments here and there.
I invite anyone else who would like to bitch about school or anything in general (voice agreements with me) to."

"event","Alright some more late night thinking for anyone who reads this, and im pretty sure someone does, but no one leaves comments!! Conspiracy?? i think so.. _ANYWAYS_ Do you realize that if we had a world wide game of simon says, and if ""simon"" listed laws and rules and shit everyone would lose? Cuz like even ghandi broke rules. And going on that, since ghandi broke rules and like supposedly jesus did too, does that mean we can too? I mean no one can tell you, you can't do this. Because really you can. Its just you can't do something without a consequence. So what if we took away the consequence. Wouldn't that make everything we do were ""not supposed"" to do ok? Going on this couldn't we legaliza drugs and shit if we just made people go to a special building down town for the day they want to do the drugs or alcohol or whatever? The gov't and health officials and shit could monitor people's intake on stuff and that would pretty much reduce chances of overdose wouldn't it? And its better than the alternative, because either way people are getting drugs. My way the government could make some cash selling us the weed. Just my random thought at two in the morning. peace out schwans."

WE have religions based on the believe of one god, multiple gods, no gods, etc. We have politics which are just like a big lying convention and a bunch ""he said, he did, i have blah blah blah"" I mean don't get me wrong, some of the shit of today is cool, but i mean it is seriously stupid. We have so many languages and religions and governments that were.....incompatible I guess is the word that comes to mind. I mean seriously think about it, starting with U.S. of course. If instead of having a president of the united states we just had polls once a month on topics that come up in congress. So instead of us fighting over which ass monkey we want leading us for four years we can voice our opinions and each will be heard. This won't completely solve politics but it should keep it on a lower level. If you don't vote and you don't like the way somethings done then fuck you, its your fault you didn't vote. Ok, next american issues, war and poverty. Ok first of for war and the U.s. feeling the need to ""police the world"" i guess, we get something similar to the U.n. except it would take actions. Basically like the senate/congress just on a global scale. I also believe every country should follow our government or the world should decide on what the general government for each country should be and then each country can slightly modify it to fit their needs. This nonpussy U.n. will be the global police basically. If a country or its people step out of line and the country can't correct it on its own then the u.n. dispatches u.n. units which would be a percent of each countrys army. So like 10% of the u.s.'s and 10% of china's, etc. This would thus solve most problems, or at least solve them better than most solutions of today. Next issue, poverty. Yea i guess since i went on that damn service trip i think about it more. Here's my idea. The government makes a shitload of huge corporations and shit right? Well I say that every fucker and business who makes/has over, lets just say this for now, 10 million a year, they should have to give x ammount of that money to a government organization dedicated to distributing funds equally among the impoverished. If you can get the poor people out of the cycle of poverty then there children will be free from it and their children will, etc, etc. Next global issue, this is for everyone. Prisons. Their are prisons everywhere for all type of people, minimum, medium, maximum security prisons and then government prisons to hold the psychopathic armed forces people and then prisons to hold sick fucks like sadam. I think that we shouldn't increase punishment by giving more people time in prison. I think people should have todo x ammount of service hours and then for a set ammount of time have to pay say 30 bucks a month and that money goes into another government thing that helps underpriveledged. Now for the really evil fucks, i say once a year we gather them up once a year, load them onto a rocket (or maybe more) and just shoot the fucks into space. Now i can't decide whether they should just orbit the earth, land on some like space prison or just float in space till they die. I appose the death penalty but approve of it at the same time, so i don't know. Lets see another major issue....

Alright i can't  think of anymore issues for now. Guess I'm finally getting tired. So this shall be the end of the worlds bandaid part1. I'll update as i think of more shit or maybe you can leave a comment and talk about an issue i talked about or one i didn't. Just to get this out of the way, all this politics stuff is dricing me crazy so I guess i just got bored and decided to do this. Gnight all

"event","Yea whats up everybody. AS you can probably tell I'm back. If you didn't know this, i hate you. No really I hate you. But maybe if you keep ready about my pointless, hopeless life you can be my friend ::fake smile:: *thumbs up sign*. Anyways, uhh not much been happenin' lately, sunday, the day after i got back (yea i lied when i said i was gettin back sunday, we got back on saturday) I went over to dereks which was awesome. He got his trampoline fixed and i had a no fear before I went over there so i was a little hyper. When i got there they had gotten one of his cats trapped on the top shelf of his closet, and later we found out that it had taken a shit everywhere. After all that excitement we were out on the trampoline and joe and matt jumped off his porch onto the trampoline, but of course since they're evil and skinny they fell on impact. Uhh after that we rode around dereks neighborhood and got mike and then went to walmart. I got another no fear and we went back to dereks and watched texas chainsaw massacre. I was really hopin that there would be more people gettin killed but I guess massacre meant how he like skinned 'em alive n shit. Uhh lets see monday and most of tuesday i was just a lazy ass, but on tuesday night i went over to nateman's house. I played myself in pingpong and the table attacked me and we also went swimming but my contacts kept rollin into the back of my eye. Oh and I guess nate didn't really like it when i was hittin him with the ducks, grant thought it was funny when i hit him but nate like chased me around the pool. We also talked about a bunch of shit, and just in case you hadn't noticed, FRIENDS AND POLITICS SHOULD NEVER BE COMBINED, SO NOBODY TALK ABOUT POLOTICS, EVER! Now that I've gotten that out of the way I think I'm ready to go to bed, or at least do somethin else.

Oh wait, one more thing, Joe asked me like yesterday or today (I can't remember days are kinda blurring into one another for me) why I had a live journal, I believe the words he used were that they were for ""gays and pussies"", well joe would ya like to leave a comment on why that is?"

"event","Yep thats right, I'm going to chicago. I'm waking up at 7 in the morning and going to chicago with a bunch of bible huggers. Why? I don't know. We're going to a community center for poor people and we're helping for like 8 hours. Anyways uhh let see what happened today....hmm Well i went over to Brians who's b-day was yesterday so happy b-day brian. Anyways we went out driving, we drove through Boss's neighborhood and went to Bk, and hes a pretty good driver. In fact my sisters could take a few tips from him. Anyways after that we chilled out at brians house, he kicked my ass in ping pong and we just hung out. After that we went to the free 311 concert which was pretty cool. I never go to any local band concerts actually i never go to concerts....whatever. Well I wish i would have moshed and I'm glad i didn't at the same time. I mean its 311, they don't realy give off the vibe for moshing. When i think of moshing music i think of like korn, static-x, shit like that. Something, anything with screaming in it. But i also wish i woulda moshed because, I've never moshed. Whatever there's always next concert i go to....Uh lets see what else happened. Uhm well we saw kristy, kelly and her lincoln friends, and they we were supposed to go find them after they left or something but I thought it was like optional or somethin. I wish we woulda gone and find them now tho because my knee is really buggin me and my heels hurt like hell. Whatever I guess thats why they say that hindvision is 20/20. Well I got nuthin else, oh wait yea i do. LEAVE COMMENTS ON MY POSTS!!! I know your reading this. Yea thats right, you. You read this and you say somethin to yourself about it. WELL CLICK THE DAMN POST BUTTON AND LEAVE A MESSAGE. Sorry i just had to get that out of my system. Well I guess I'm done for now. Ill see you guys next sunday, the 25th."

"event","Well I reading a thing on weird sex laws at an un-named website (i say unknown because it has 15 porn pop ups for every page... you get the drift). Anyways here it is:
""The owner of every hotel in Hastings, Nebraska, is required to provide each guest with a clean and pressed nightshirt. No couple, even if they are married, may sleep together in the nude. Nor may they have sex unless they are wearing one of these clean, white cotton nightshirts."" Now what the fuck do you think caused them to pass this law? I mean seriously what good is a shirt when your having sex?"

"event","Well last night i finally got around to watching final destination 2. Ok, well i only watch half of it.....Alright, fine, I only watched 30 minutes of it. To tell the truth i was honestly bored as hell when i started watching it and i got even boreder as the movie progressed. It had a cool action scene at the beginning with a huge car accident, which I'm sure most of you have seen if you've seen the previews to it.  And it had a stoner which was loaded down with weed, but not even 10 minutes into it he dies. And then another guy dies 10 minutes later. What da fuck is this? I mean, the plot itself is interesting. About how death has its own design and once death decides its your turn to die, you die. But at the same time, its really, really stupid. The whole movie revolves around them dying. God damnit just kill them at the beginning and call it a short movie. They have books like that out, ya know what I mean? Its like 20 pages long and somewhere along the 10th page you realize whats going to happen. This was like that except by the time you get a minute into you can already tell yourself ""They are all fuckin screwed!"". Alright well I guess I'm done rambling. I think tonight/today I'll watch Thirteen (http://imdb.com/title/tt0328538/). It sounds pretty interesting, kind of. I don't think I'll like it, oh well."

"event","Ok everyone you can stop praying, I've returned from the hell hole called ""Iowa"" filled with who dave likes to call ""iowegians"". Like always the trip was quite boring but not boring enough for me to get in a fight with my parents. The way i figure it is if i do what they tell me to for the 4-5 days we're in Iowa then I can lock myself in my room without them bugging me (even more then they do). So who wants to know about the trip?! Don't all raise your hand at once now......because I hardly remember what happened. Here's an interesting fact I've discovered traveling to the other side of iowa to see a big puddle of green water they call ""Clear Lake: Every single gas station next to the interstate sells condoms in the bathroom. Which I don't understand because really there are only about 10-20 hot girls in the entire state from what I've seen. For some reason unapparent to me, I think I'm going to get yelled at by someone for that last sentence. Oh well... Well I'm done for now."

"event","Alright so i go to bed at about 3, which is pretty early for me I guess. Anyways my mom comes screaming into my room at like 7, saying something about trash and how I didn't do it when I was supposed to or something. So i take out the trash and go back to my bed, and pass out until about 3 in the afternoon. Now i have a question for you all, why the hell do i get more messages when I'm not at my computer then when I am? I had at least 8 people iming me telling me to get back and wake up and other shit. ANYWAYS.....nothin else really happened till it rained. I had to go to the dentist where they pulled my tooth after i told them last time I was there I didnt want it pulled. Then i got home and it started raining. So we went outside and messed around (we being me and my neighbors). And then zach and i were just like messing around and flipping out and shit. Now I'm being told we're going to iowa until monday which is pissing me off. We weren't supposed to leave until tomorrow so I'm scrambling to get all my cds gathered up. What the hell am i supposed to do for 4 days without any games or fireworks?"

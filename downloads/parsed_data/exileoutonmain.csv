"event","one day everyone who's talked shit about me and my gf's relationship, will take their fucking words back.  Envy plays such a big role. Why? Because you will never hear a happy couple talk shit about another couple. But you will ALWAYS hear a fucked up couple talk shit about a couple who's actually making and effort and doing a good job at being a couple worth of admiration.
christina isabel perez, eres el amor de mi vida. y los demas que se vayan a la verga"

"event","I don't want to monopolized your time nor control your whereabouts. Like you've told me before, you have your own life. I understand. I know you're busy with school now, and especially that your best friend has come back to town, you will be occupy nonetheless.
But what I cannot understand is the ""testing"" you do on me.The only tests I'm willing to take is that of my career but not from the person I fucking love. You shouldn't tests my motives. The reason why I didn't text you is just as follows: the night prior I texted you twice and no response. I usually get a ""I fell asleep"" the next morning. But I didn't. not until 4pm when I received a ""hello stranger"" seriously, stranger me? The whole fucking day had been shitty at work and thinking you were upset at me or angry or something made it worse. But no, it was just one of your tests on me.

don't test me. If I want to be tested I'll go back to fucking school.
and if you read this, which I'm sure you will, I hope you understand it through digital font because obviously I cannot talk to you about it. And like you've said before, then who the fuck am I suppose to rely on. Once again, take your own advice and put yourself in my shoes. Like you've said before, you look forward to my calls. Don't you think I do too? Don't you think I look forward to at least a text in the morning. And rather then telling me ""why are you settling."" Change your fucking ways if you claim to feel strongly about me rather then telling me ""then why are you with me?"" for every time I call you out on something you're not doing or I wished you would change. Because every time you call me on it, I try my fucking best.

it's easy, really."

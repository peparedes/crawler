"event","today was my first day at rancho... omg, wow. haha, it is SOOOO completely different that it is unbelieveable... scary even. 

Before school, I went striaight to Kuhn's class, since I have him first period, and we were talking about what I did in drama at Kremers class (practically nothing!!!) and so now i get to help with one acts... then class started and like 40 people walked in... it was sooo awesome. He was talking about festival (im so excited about this) and then yah, he took D2 with him down to the MPR and so me and Sarah and Harmony started talking about how this girl Erin kicked her out of the one act, and then me and Harmony went down to the MPR, and like 2 minutes later Sarah comes downstairs to the MPR and she goes ""Abrie, Craig wants you to go back upstairs."" He told me he wasn't going to be there today so when she said that I like, ran back upstairs and hopped into his arms... It was great. I missed him sooooo much!!! lol. and so we were talking, and he will probably switch 2 3/4 also... i cant wait, he's my lover cakes. lol yah so that was like the best part of the day.

then the bell rang and like... it was time to go to second period... and like yah... craig walked me to my class (AFTER WE FOUND IT!!!) but then there was like, alot of time so I walked him back 2 the stairs, and then i went to class. I sat next to this girl Christy/Christine that I knew from freshman year... we talked a little... pretty boring after that though...

then i walked ALL THE WAY ACROSS campus to Algebra 2 which is full of immature sophmores... OMG, it was soo annoying... not to mention the fact, i had like, no clue wtf we were doing... something to the x power??? i didn't learn that shit in my class!!! that frustrated me, but it was over soon and thennnnnnnnn....

lunch... i went and got my ID card, talked to Brooks some, got my Alg. 2 book and then since I didn't know if I knew anybody, just went upstairs to Kuhn's room and talked to everybody in there... *sighs*

Chemistry afterwards... ADVANCED CHEM... i was sittin next 2 these pretty chill girls N this one guy... they was all cool, so that made it good. THANK GOD, we had already done VSPER in Haus' class. And umm... what else... that was it, we were building models/talking the whole time

THEN, History.... *slams face down on desk* There were alot of people I knew in that class, (I didn't know Jacklin Magnano switched over to Rancho!! And also, Molina and Julie are soooo beautiful, I didn't know that) BUt anyways, this girl Cierra that I knew from freshman year comes up to me in we were like.. yah, blah blah blah, how's school... whatnot... then she starts up with the rumour mill, things she heard in shit... one of which was, was i dating her ex boyfriend Ray-Ray. (some others included do i/did i worship the devil? *hahahahahah!!!!!* i have like 3 kids *hahahahahah!!!* I'm pregnant right now, and that's why I switched *hahahahaha!!!* and that I'm lesbian *rolls on the floor, unable to breathe!!!* and yah, not all those from her, but just around school) and I was like no, I'd never go with him, cuz #1 I never liked him/thought he was cute #2 I knew how he had fucked her over, and how he fucked over countless other girls, and thats not my style #3 he took one of my good friends virginity and then was like ""ur not my type of girl"" soooo... thats why i wouldnt get with him... in the end i think she believed me but yah... it was fucking dumb... like why the fuck would u want to talk about me? i didn;t do shit tooo ANY of them down there, but whatever. I'm over it now.

6th period Spanish 3, the teacher was sooo impressed with my speaking and writing skills. that made me feel a little better. all in all today was an ok day... i'll keep u updated though."

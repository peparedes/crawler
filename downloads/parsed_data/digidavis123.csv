And the party, well, that was funny
Nate was really hott and dan and sean were cute. Well, the boys were the best part about the party cuz they were real entertaining. Sean kept singing too ""All the things she said"" (they had a mix cd) but he changed it and instead of sayin ""all the things she said"" he kept singing ""i'm a lesbian, i'm a lesbian, we're all lesbians, we're all lesbians, i'm a lesbian"" in the mike. haha i couldn't stop laughing. He's got nothin against them, i mean, he said that cuz he made one girl cry by pointing to her and singing ""your a lesbian"" for a joke but she's got a lot of troubles at home i guess what i heard (dad died, mom's real sick and might die) so yeah, i feel bad. And then he kept pullin his pants down showin us his spongebob boxers and running arund

I'm feelin better just thinkin that those people actually care about me and do stuff for me.....none of my other friends do. Thanks a lot! love ya guys!

Anyway
tommorow is the valentines dance. i'm gonna go i guess. 

hehe i love the cards my mommy and daddy give me. they always have a cute dog or somethin on 'em. I hope i get one this year. I don't expect much at all from them. I mean, i wouldn't care if they didn't give me anything. And since i know they are, i just expect a card and chocolate. I love that gift from them :) and they're love of course :)(haha that was korny but true)

stupid mouth piece keeps attactching to my gum and it hurts :(i hafta rip it out, owie :(

I'm gonna go. I'm thinkin of makin lots of my entries personal cuz who reads them? i mean, i really do know that people don't or they just skim or they just dont' care. i don't just say that so people will comment cuz i could care less about them. But yeah, i'll think of makin it private.

I
Love

"event","yeah uhhhh....haven't been on for a while cuz i'm grounded from the computer until saturday. oooh well

i'm just gonna pretend i updated all those days cuz i really don't feel like updating all that

Anyway, 1st-3rd period we had testings today and tommorow we will too. Hey, at least i missed math and science. but i missed art :( i really need to go to art cuz i'm gonna get behind on my project if i don't. oh well

Uhhhh....i think evan caught me lookin at him a 311 times. lol he's probably used to it now. i can't help it durin the testings....cuz he's just sorta...there. even though he's across the gym from me but still. yeah, he was lookin in my direction most of the time while we were waiting for the next test thingy but i just like to say he was lookin at me, but i doubt he was. But it makes me feel better :-D hehe anyway, yeah, i really wish he AT LEAST liked me a little. lfasjflkjaslkf I LOVE HIM! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! i don't care, people say i don't, like aubrey was tellin me that if i really knew him, i wouldn't love him anymore cuz he's mean. she said he was like the nicest person last year but he's meaner now i guess but i don't care. He's still evan and i bet he's still got that great personality that i love and i don't care what anyone says. but no, i'm not mad at aubrey. cuz we were kiddin around sayin what the real meanin of love is online
Aubrey:Mike is the meaning of love, thats my definition
Me:Evan is love-my definition
lol we talk about the weirdest things

My friends are crazy this year. They like just are. They keep switchen friends. practically all of my friends do. like aubrey doesn't hang with me that much unless shannon or sam isn't around and i can't stand Shannon, seriously. she is soo annoyin. Sam is cool though. And annoyin josephine keeps followin me. i can't stand her either. JaAni's cool. Amber is annoyin too. She thinks she's cool and says THE stupidest comebacks. geez everyone's annoyin! Like the only people who haven't ditched me are JaAni and Heather. And only one of them is in 8th grade and thats JaAni. but there ain't nothin wrong with 7th graders or nothin but i don't see her that much. Oh well, screw it, the only thing that keeps me in school is seriously evan. My mom wants to move and i don't wanna switch schools cuz i'll never see him again then. 
Braces in 1 week, ugggggggggggh!

YEah, i gotta go now and do my stupid science project. i gotta color too much but colorin is fun :)

THAT THE 311 CONCERT WAS AWWWWESOME!!!! and i CAN'T wait to see them in person!!!! but what sucks is that i realllllly wanna see it again but 1.it costs $20 and it wasn't even an hour and a half and 2.I can't keep goin over will's house, lol
haha, when tony hawk came on, i was about to say ""hey, that looks like tony hawk!"" cuz i didn't think that he would be a 311 fan but then i realized, it is, lol. I'm stupid
:):)I loooved when nick took his shirt off, hehe. He's still realllly hot in brown hair :)
But what sucks is that my sister came over cuz i told her she could and all she did is talk THE WHOLE time! I was soo mad. She was talking to chris and will about her sax and school and stuff and i was like ""oh....my...gosh....SHUT UP!!!"" but i couldn't cuz i think chris woulda gotten mad. ugh, i told her today. And then on ""Feels so Good"" she was talkin and talkin like you wouldn't believe. Then i told her ""Molly, can you PLEASE stop talking, its the last song"" and she still did. that ruined it but it was still great.
I got a guinea pig named ""Amber"" hehe it fits her though. and today my mom got one cuz she loves guinea pigs and her name is ""abby"" but my dad (and my bro i think) don't know about it cuz my dad would flip and my brother would blabber it or somethin. well, he might know considering my brother, sister and my mom are in my room lookin at them. 
I really really REALLY don't wanna go back to school.  Ugh this is gonna suck. But at least i'll see evan.
annnd, i left my 311 hoodie at heathers! Nooo! But she's bringin it in tommorow and i got an independent t-shirt today. Its bootiful
Oh yeah, i just sorta remembered this. When 311 was singing ""F*ck the naisers (sp) cuz they don't mean a thing"" and i always knew that that was an important line and stuff but for some reason, it just sorta felt really important at the time. like, it was well.....i can't tell the words but you know what i'm talkin about. But when they played ""Reconsider Everything"" that was awesssome

F*ck the naisers cause they don't mean a thing

SinginAngel1213: sarah smith  
SinginAngel1213: u r so negative u need 2 b more positive n optimistic  
Indpendntskatin: its not my fault, i've never had a bf. so i can be negative when it comes to guys. Cuz everyone i like, goes out with one of my friends. All my friends has bf's. Everyone likes them!
Indpendntskatin: and i will be VERY VERY upset if evan ever went out with someone. No, i'm not sayin that in a 'greedy' way but everyone i like goes out with someone else
Indpendntskatin: (*ex* josh)
SinginAngel1213: evans not goin out wit some1  
SinginAngel1213: cuz no1 wants him  
Indpendntskatin: except, i don't think i would go out w/ josh to tell ya the truth. I like evan too much and it wouldn't feel right

I like to talk to aubrey, she makes me feel better. Actually, the whole thing about no one wanting to go out with evan is prolly true cuz i seem to be the only one that likes(loves) him :)"

all day i have an urge to read 311 lyrics (thats why i print some out to bring) and then i want to listen to their music. Its non stop. All i think about is their strong lyrics. How they affect me. I get home and listen to them all day, on the computer, doin hw, sleeping, ect. I want to write as good as they do. I want to write their lyrics out over and over on paper."

her secret disguised behind the lies 
and at night she crys away her pride 
with eyes shut tight staring at her inside 
all her friends know why she can't sleep at night 
all her family asking is she alright 
all she wants to do is get rid of this hell 
well all she's got to do is stop kiddin herself 
she can only fool herself for so long [x3]

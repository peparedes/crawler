"event","this is just wrong.

Yestarday I woke up around 5:00 am. showered, left Hans' and went to work -I enter at 6:00- when I get there, the girl from the other shift is nowhere to be seen so I go to the back room to change (there's no way in hell I'm walking out in the street with that fucking Oxxo uniform); so, I've undressed when she bursts into the room.

At first she rushed to apologize and all that rubbish, but then she didn't leave, so, oh my god, anyway, I was at it with her when I realized what the fuck I was doing, so I just pushed her away, half dressed and got the hell out.

I went looking for Hans but he was already gone.

Well, I guess I don't have a job anymore."

"event","Gerard Project.........or Game 7? So here's what's gonna happen: if i choose to work on my project during game 7 of the Pistons - Cavaliers series, LeBron James is probably gonna make history by like coming from down by like 40 points to win the game in three overtimes with stats like 74 points, 16 rebounds, 14 assists, 9 steals, and 5 blocks. i would cry. eternally. OK. so let's say i decide to watch the game. I fail to complete the project and LeBron has a terrible game and gets destroyed by the team that should've ended this series three games ago. pros and cons, pros and cons............i guess i'll do the project..........its a harder choice than you'd think."

2) Summer Job
3) Play basketball

Once I get back, I'll be ready to take on my final year here. Here are my goals:

1) One B per term at most. All A's if possible. Next year will not be a repeat of this year.
2) Get accepted to one of three colleges: Baylor U., Austin C., Tulsa U. Midwest colleges kick ass.
3) Play basketball.

Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios
Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go
It's all for the character and the arrogant afterglow
Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth
And what your parents handed down to you to handle
Make sure you carry torches when their puttin out your candles
Prediction can be unkind but unwind them still
Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

Well I've seen you and those things you do
And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you
Your dark defines your light

There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with
And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift
When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to lift
I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist
Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed
You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist
And there's no way to get back experiences you missed
So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss"

"event","teh formal was greatness. they screwed me on my platinum tie, but i lived without. had so much fun, makes me wonder why i worried so much about whether i would or not without a date. i moved my crap down here to niall's room. i'm not moving down here, unless tommy decides to not fix the port in my room, which is very likely. i'm finally gonna get myself an ipod so i wont be so damn bored during my trips. niall and i are going to taco bell to acquire more music that i cant find anywhere here. too bad limewire and the hot spot dont exactly mix. i feel great. almost like myself again. a few more steps and i'm there. have a great week everybody."

"event","I want to stop bitching so bad, but i'm so frustrated right now, and i just want this issue to not exist. I've complained constantly about them and there's only one way i can solve it: by doing something. But when i have the chance, i dont, and now i cant just be myself. I can forget about the stupid things i've done, but when i'm around other people who know what i've done, it just lingers in the back of my mind and keeps me from being normal. And yes, my whole social problem thing now has to do with only like three or four girls here, but it aggrivates me soooooo damn much that i cant be Jake all the time. That was the reasoning behind wanting to ask certain people to the winter formal. but of course, if no one knows me, no one will want to go with me, right? all i have to do is strike one normal conversation with each of those that i am uncomfortable around and it would be all over. i just want to say i'm not wanted. unless someone says that, i really doubt that. when i'm comfortable around these people, my little circle of friends would be closed, complete enough for me to be content here. The way it was last year. Pardon me.................FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!.......eventually i'll just say that.....fuck this......and then just start acting like the jake everyone remembers from last year. aside from all this.........i probably could use a really good friend of the opposite sex.........i want a girl in my life that is just my female equivalent of Niall, of Creed, of Joel even(?....i guess....). i need balance............maybe some Zolof or whatever the hell you call that stuff.....""happy pills"".......good day all........good day........."

"event","if only i were ingorant to others' knowledge.......there would be like no pressure on me and things would be a lot easier........i guess.........or should i just not care what others think or know and be myself? wait its not like its an option, i cant be just ignorant...........well then. how do you not care about what others think about you? that is easily the #1 thing that keeps me from being content on a consistent basis.............all i need to do is break out of this for one minute and be myself for just a little while and i think that would do a world of good for me......i always picture myself doing it but when i'm in the situation to be myself i just do..............nothing. who knows? maybe someday i'll take a ""risk"" and be social, like it even is a risk.........."

"event","i have been so wound up and tight about everything. it wasnt like this back when i had sports to play. i would have a blah kind of week, ya know, a then we'd have that game at the end of the week. seems like they'd all be so close. i remember workin my ass of to get my part done, putting every ounce of adrenaline and emotion i had into it. i'd do it, and whether we won or lost, i felt so great those next few days. especially after a game that was so insane that it left people on thier knees, crying(yeah, it happened once). i wish i had the drive to do things the way i wanted to on that football field. i have way too much emotion and adrenaline and stuff to just sit here and talk about emotional stuff. i need to ""play it out"". i wonder if soccer could do that for me? i know i could pick it up easy, but it would have to be the kind of sport where i know my little actions make a difference. its easy for me to see that in football, notsomuch for soccer. meh.....i guess giving it a try would not hurt, tho i know i'm more for ""hands"" on sports, if you know what i mean."

"event","k everyone................break is almost over, and i can actually say i cant wait to be back in mobile. stayed with dominick, and while i didnt have as much fun as a whole as expected, i had much more fun than i would have had, had i stayed here at home. i am more than ready to get this term rolling.......i think. before i leave to go back i have a couple of things to say i guess:

JOEL- i've missed you.........we can only hope there is still time for me to be philosophical and stuff
NIALL- if we cant get a second ethernet port, i will really push to move in you......or at least i may move compy to your room
::btw, if anyone likes Risk or cool games like that, get The Political Machine...yes niall, i'm getting it again::
JAMES- things dont seem the same as last year for some reason.....i'm sure it'll change once youve been here for a few weeks
ELISE- dom and i harassed each other about absolutely everything......i dont ""like"" you or anything like that, as much as i enjoyed listening to dom's reasoning (why i shouldnt ""try""?) though
BEN- ::flying moose kick:: yeah, that felt good.
KYLE- diffcal sure is fun, isnt it? i know how much youre ""struggling"" in there.....i'm here for ya:)
SEAN- maybe sometime during the christmas break dominick and i can see you or something......i guess
EVERYONE- hope you all got your new year's resolutions planned.....can you believe it's already almost december? hope everyone had a fantastic thxgiving break...........HAPPY HOLIDAYS you guys:)"

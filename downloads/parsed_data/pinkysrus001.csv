"event","ive gotten too attached.
it was never suppose to be like this, i was suppose to stay for a bit then go back to where i was. im suprised ive been here this long. that ive made friends that mean more then the others could. i do miss them and what i had back there, but ive met such amazing people here that i dont want to leave. anothny's graduation last night set the deal. i want to graduate here in arizona, not in california. i want to go to collage in arizona, not california.

my mind is made up, i love this place<3"

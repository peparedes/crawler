Well my weekend has come to an end yet again, have had a great time with friends. One thing can be said, I have great friends.

With regards to my last journal entry I have been given some great food for thought from my good buddy Matt regarding possible career paths that I hadn't considered but would offer me the chance to completely turn my life around in the long run and in a good way.

If this does turn out how I would like it to then Im pretty certain that I will emigrate to either Canada or Australia as I dream of doing, hopefully partnered but I want it badly enough to go it alone.

Ok now that I have so many thought processes running through my mind Im going to go do something creative and as always I will keep updated on whats happening.

Take Care and Play Safe

"event","The phrase ""I could so soo jump on a plane right now its not even funny!!!"" springs to mind today folks.

I can't seem to make sense of a lot of things lately and I hate it. Im stuck in a deep rut regarding what i want to do with my life because the things I can do something about, im having no luck in.

I'm going out tonight so I had better go get ready and I'll keep updated as always.

Take Care

"event","Today ........ Wednesday 25th October 2006 at 19:22 I sit and write you about my day.

This morning at 06:20 I was awoken by the loud but effective Alarm Clock to start another day in HBOS, The Price I pay for my sins eh?
Started work at 08:30 and from about 11:00 everything seemed to be very weird. Customers were thanking me for being helpful. Some even said that if all were as helpful as me then HBOS would be a far better bank.

Finished at 17:00 and caught bus home at 17:20 and fell into a deep sleep. I awoke 2 stops before mine in Forfar, a lucky escape from a bitch of a walk back home.

As soon as I opened the front door I was greeted by the great smell of home cooking, mother was making home made soup! OMG! YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM!

I have been thinking more than ever now about what i want from my life and how to achieve it. I know im not smart enough to be a top notch professional but to think of myself being stuck in that hole of a call centre for forever more is sickening. 

I must decide what I want to do and go for it, not get too comfortable in a life that I really sometimes do not like and I MUST do something before its too late!

Again I will keep appraised of developments!

Night Guys And Stay Cool!

"event","Howdy peeps,

Well today has been a strange one indeed! It started off as any other day then seemed to slide further and further down a slope of depressive badness! Work has the tendancy to do that to you after 4 years!!! I am to be moving teams too, not happy about leaving my current team because I like my boss and love the rest to shreds. Alison and I will be separated too and that I'm really not happy about but there is nothing I can do about it. Mind you I could do a lot worse, at least Im still gonna get a good Manager.

Then to top it all off the bus driver charged me 80p to get home because my ticket was issued from Stobswell and not City Centre. Friggin *^!?!

I got home and decided to make myself a well deserved cup of coffee then knocked over the cup and spilt it all over the kitchen floor. It was not a great moment I can tell you! Swearing and Yelling Like a Maniac! 

On a more positive note I'm really gonna focus on getting my life in order. I need to decide what i want out of it and just go for it! I'm not getting any younger!

Will keep you posted as to my developments.

Stay Cool You Guys!

Danny Man"
